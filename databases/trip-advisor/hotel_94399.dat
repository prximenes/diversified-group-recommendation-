<Content>Great location Second visit to this hotel.Easily accessed from the airport using public transport.Hotel is approx 150 yards from State Street 'T'. This area is not busy at the weekend due to being in the financial district but always feels very 'safe' somehow.Our rooms were identical on both occassions.Due to the dark furniture,curtains and bedding, and also the small windows, the room initially seemed small, but in reality we thought it was fine.Bathroom very small with only a shower cubical and no bath, but again we found it suffice. I have seen on this site,some people mention about rooms that have a fridge and kitchen area but not all rooms have this. There are 2 'free to use' computers on the ground floor which were always in use when I wanted to use them but I found most people (myself included) only used them for a short time so therefore if you wait around for a while you can normally go on line without having to wait too long.We didn't have much need to talk to the staff, but when we did they were helpful and informative. FREE bottled water on each floor- TIP- ice buckets and ice available to take to your room, from outside the gym area !!!Next door to the hotel (and accessed through an interconnecting door) is a bar/restaurant -Elephant and Castle-breakfasts were ok, but bar snacks and meals in the evening were GREAT-Frozen Margaritas V.GOOD !..5 min walk to Fanuiel Hall area bars and restaurants(-we liked Cheers and Big Dicks Last Resort),Shops (Victoria Secret,Abercrombie,American Eagle,Gap etc) Also Bostix discount ticket booth(Sign up online for up to date info-we REALLY enjoyed the BLUE MAN GROUP-hard to describe, but not really for those interested in 'posh' /fancy shows)Also 5 min walk to harbour area(Legal Seafoods,Hard Rock Cafe, and in particular Joes American Bar at the waterfront which we thought was REALLY LOVELY due to location/views/linen table cloths/staffs uniforms and very resonable prices !!!)4 min walk to 'Downtown crossing' area (Macys,TJ Maxx,Marshals,DSW,Borders etc) 10 mins walk to Boston Common leading to shopping at Newbury Street,Prudential building and the Back Bay area....DONT MISS THE DUCK TOURS...informative and interesting but definitely NOT boring. A REALLY ENTERTAINING experience. Would definitely stay here again (we are an easy going couple in our 40's ,teenage kids left safely at home but WILL bring kids here in the future)

<Content>Awful Nothing went right during my stay. Only one elevator was in service. Only one ice machine in the entire hotel, apparently, and it was out of service. I called staff about it and after an interminable wait they basically said it could not be repaired. I asked the desk clerk if there was any way I could get ice; she told me I could go to the restaurant next door. I asked her if she was categorically telling me that the hotel could not provide me, a paying guest, something as basic as ice; she said that was indeed the case. The room was small, dirty, loud, and uncomfortable. I will never return.

<Content>Very Pleased with Club Quarters After reading some reviews, we were concerned about our choice. There was no reason to be concerned. Our rooms (3) were clean, quiet, tastefully furnished and except for one room having a very small shower area, we had no complaints. I don't know why people complained about the staff. They could not have been more helpful or pleasant, especially Beverly who went out of her way to help us make plans for a day trip to Cape Cod. Coffee and Tea each weekday morning was a nice surprise. They even served cookies one evening while a group was watching TV in the club lounge. The location is great and we liked having a pub adjacent to the hotel. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. Certainly worth the money.

<Content>No sleep If you stay here be sure to ask for a room that does not have a faulty airconditioner. Mine (503) kept me awake all night. When I reported it to the front desk they told me they knew some rooms have that problem sorry.

<Content>Rude staff The hotel itself is quite nice for business travel. Nothing special about the rooms, business center or fitness center but they are functional. The filtered water is a nice touch. All but one of the front desk staff we dealt with were rude. They did not want to help us with directions or booking restaurant reservations. There was one gentleman at the desk who was the exception and we left him a nice tip for being so helpful and kind. I will probably stay at another hotel when I come back to Boston.

<Content>Decent enough I needed to spend 3 days mid-week in Boston. To avoid being ripped off by the airlines it is cheaper to buy a hotel + flight than flight alone (or back to back flights as two are cheaper than one).I chose this Hotel as it was convenient for the subway. I had a decent size room with Internet access and a small kitchen area which I never got to use. The location is convenient and central and the attached British pub was OK although Bostom is a place of many pubs and the overall standard is good.Staff were friendly enough and it was clean, which is enough for me when on business. The central location would be good for tourists and I'd have no qualms about using this again

<Content>Great location, great price, great accomodations We booked several rooms for guests at our daughter's wedding at an average price of $130/night per room. The accommodations were very comfortable; the showers were particularly impressive. The club room was a very convenient place for 'herding' groups of relatives prior to heading out to a wedding-related function. The hotel's 20% discount with the nearby 33 Arch Street parking garage was also much appreciated.The only negative comment from one member of the party was that the noise from the room next door could be heard through the doors connecting the two rooms. Once they stuffed two duvets in the space between the two doors, however, the noise went away.Overall: a great place to stay in downtown Boston.

<Content>Nice stay at Club Quarters Boston We just returned from a two night stay at Club Quarters Boston. The hotel is in a great location. Yes, the rooms were a bit small however after reading some of the reviews I expected worse. They were clean (and I am very fussy) and the beds were very comfortable. As we had a room at the end of the hall, it was quiet . We did hear the tv from the next room one night so I guess if you had loud neighbors it could be a problem. We found the desk staff to be very helpful - Chris especially. He was friendly and took a lot of time highlighting a map for us and giving helpful tips. I got a very good rate calling the hotel direct - $158 per night. We would stay at this hotel again!

<Content>A glorified business dormitory I stayed at the Club Quarters in Boston for two nights early in August 2008. I booked my stay at CQ as a preferred hotel for my company through Orbitz for Business, and based my choice on the combination of central location and reasonable rate. In both cases, the CQ is eminently satisfactory. The hotel provides a clean, reasonably comfortable room for about 60% of the price of other hotels on our preferred list, and is very central to Boston's Financial district.What you won't find at CQ is anything resembling a frill. Check-in is via a self-service kiosk that didn't work at all (apparently, this is a common event, because the one person who IS at the front desk, concierge-like, hovers by the check-in kiosks to intercept frustrated guests). The lobby is tiny, more like a vestibule -- nicely decorated but cramped. I didn't go into the club room off the lobby, but it looked nice enough. You gain access to your room by zipping your room key in the elevator -- a security feature, I suppose, but I don't feel that insecure in hotels, so to me it's just a pain. My room was on the sixth floor, off a narrow hallway the runs through the center of the building (past, as others have noted, a machine that provides chilled and filtered water -- a nice touch). The room itself was small but decently appointed -- somewhat spartan, in the fashion of a mid-seventies college dorm-room that had been gussied up with some designer furniture and finishes -- but you could still see its origins in the narrow room, cheap tile, and bath fixtures. Serviceable, but not cozy or warm. Also -- my room faced Devonshire Street, and was moderately noisy all night.Overall -- a decent value for the money, well situated, and passably comfortable -- but you won't mistake it for the Taj.

<Content>best for Monday to Friday business guests We stayed on Thurs and Friday nights. The bedding was extremely odd in that the bottom sheets did not make it up to the top of the mattress, so that about 5-6 inches of mattress was visible on both of the beds. The sheets were always loose because of this and because the maid did not tuck them in on the sides. Bathroom not tidied up by the maid.The pillows appeared to have been washed in a machine because they were a mass of lumps. One replacement pillow was available in the guest closet on each floor, but no pillowcase, so no good for that. There was a pillowtop mattress in a plastic case stored under my bed which was large and poked out under the bed on both sides. This hotel has a service for frequent visitors whereby you can leave things in the hotel for future visits. i wonder if this was someone's pillowtop stored under my bed. There is access to computer use in the Club Room off the lobby, but was unavailable to us for three hours on Friday due to a group meeting in there. The free morning coffee in this Club Room is not available on weekends, which is annoying and also insulting, considering that we were told that since the hotel is in the financial district, there are barely any places open on the weekend for breakfast. The adjoining restaurant, only has a $18 buffet available. Nothing else. The purified water on each floor with bottles is innovative and much appreciated. One young man at the desk, was friendly and always asked if we were having a good time and found interesting things to do. Overall, this hotel's management seems to be a little peculiar and fragmented.

<Content>Good Value We stayed at the Club Quarters from July 19 to July 21 and we were very happy with the hotel. The situation of the hotel in Boston is perfect, just a few blocks from Washington Street and 10 minutes from the Faneuil Hall which we had to take the hop on/hop off. The staff was very helpful and polite. The room was small but very clean and very quiet. (we had a room on the 8th floor). However, we do not recommend this hotel if you have young children because of the small room and the small elevators!

<Content>Good for the price We spent the 4th of July here and were also able to check in early, which was a plus, however it took 2 tries to get into the room (they ended up giving us the room next door and new card keys). They have a self-serve computerized system to check-in and out, but they are willing to assist you. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was this really stale smell to the room. I still can't figure out exactly what it was. When we went downstairs, I asked if it was nonsmoking and the woman assured me it was, but it didn't bother me enough to schlep all our luggage to another room after the hassle it took to get the first one. The room is updated and clean for the most part, but I noticed that they only clean superficially. Someone's hair clip was left on the floor and there were other indications that they don't clean the room too thoroughly. We had a full size bed, which was actually two twins pushed together. I was so tired, it didn't matter, but that seemed awkward to me. The restroom was fine, but the shower is in the corner, so it is incredibly cramped! They definitely need to get new shower curtains. I do not like looking at stains or mildew.Someone mentioned the filtered water, which is a plus. I also liked that they had wireless internet available and computer stations downstairs so we could also print items that we needed during the trip (coupons, boarding pass, etc). They also serve Numi tea in the room (organic, sustainable, green company), even though it's only one tea bag.The other thing that bothered me was how thin the walls were. I constantly felt like we should be whispering so that we wouldn't bother our neighbors and they couldn't overhear our conversations. When I was out in the hallway, I could hear TVs on, and entire conversations if I just stood there long enough.Overall, it was a good deal considering the holiday weekend (I saw mostly couples (younger and older) but not many families. There were guests for business during the weekdays). We paid about $150. It's also worth checking frequently as their rates do change.

<Content>It had free filtered water. I stayed at Club Qurters for my cousins wedding. I guess that you do get what you paid for. My brother and I got a room there for 3 nights. It took a while to find the hotel, there is an awning that has the logo and nothing else. You really have to look for it to find the hotel. Not to mention that it is not a lot of fun to drive in downtown Boston. Luckily, we didn't have to drive! The room had 2 twins bed, a small desk, a 19 inch flat panel tv, a chair and a very small bathroom. There was barely enough room for two sets of golf clubs and 2 suitcases. The beds were alright, the sheets were stained and had to be changed (and may not have been changed the entire time we were there). The bed had a sheet and a comforter and no extra blankets. They only gave us 2 towels in the bathroom, so nothing extra to use. We also had our room cards replaced twice because they would never work. The guy at the front desk thought he was better then everyone there and was not the friendliest. The walls are pretty thin. We could hear the chicks in the next room. I am just glad we didn't waste that much money on the hotel. The nice thing was that they had plastice water bottles and free filtered water. That was about the only thing I liked about the trip.

<Content>Great Location, Decent Hotel We spent 4 nights at the Club Quarters right in the heart of Boston. The location was great 鈥?close to Fanueil Hall, the Boston Common, the Freedom Trail, several T stations, all kinds of restaurants, etc. I was a bit worried, having read past reviews, but the size of the room was just fine and had plenty of room for the two of us. The bathroom was small but sufficient, had plenty of mirrors and hot water, although the walls could have used a coat of paint. The express check-in machine was a nice idea but it wasn't working properly so it was great to have a staff member available at the desk. The woman who checked us in was very personable. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for some of the other staff members, but all were efficient and knowledgeable.The purified water station in the hall was great but the idea of a guest supply closet is just silly. We actually checked it several times each day for extra pillows and/or towels but found it empty every time. (Why not just have the extras in the room already?) Along the same lines, if you choose not to have your linens changed daily, remember that you'll probably run out of such things as shampoo and toilet paper!If you get one of the 鈥?1 rooms (801, 901, etc.), I suggest you ask for a different room. These rooms are literally right off the elevators and you'll hear the foot traffic. It seems that even the most polite hotel guests will tend to talk loudly while waiting for the elevators, at all hours of the day or night, not realizing there's a guest room right there.A word of warning 鈥?whatever you do, do not try to take the stairs to another floor or down to the lobby. Once you're in the stairwell, the door will lock behind you and you will have to walk all the way down, out onto the street and back in through the front door of the hotel. It's an interesting trip if you're wearing only pajamas and wooly socks.The Elephant and Castle restaurant next door to the hotel is a bit expensive but the food, while nothing fancy, is not bad. It's obviously very popular, always crowded and you can charge your dinner to your hotel room. It's a great place to have a nightcap before heading up to bed.While our stay at the Club Quarters was nice enough, I'm not sure we'll hurry back. If you're planning to see Boston, take tours, see shows or go out for dinners and all you need is a roof over your head and a pillow under it, this hotel will do just fine.

<Content>Overall a good stay at a good price Generally I think it's a good place to stay for a reasonable price. I paid $122 through hotels.com for a Sunday night traveling on business, and stayed on floor 10. The room is small but OK for 1 night. Everything worked, bed was comfy, room was fairly quiet, even the heat/AC. Great location if you need downtown Boston. One thing I didn't like was the teeny stand up shower. Once you make room for the shower curtain that keeps seeking out your wet skin (instead of a sliding door) you have very little room to shower. Then there was water all over the floor when I got done. The other thing that bugged me was the check in/check out process. They have a kiosk near the front desk which they mandate you use, either with or without their help. Upon arrival it was like 'hi there. . . go use the machine.' Not much of a welcome. But generally I thought it was a good room at a good price.

<Content>Good location, good service, small room, bad bed I stayed here for 4 nights on May 15-19. I had no complaints about the staff - they were attentive and helpful. The pub next door had food/drink at reasonable prices for the area and also delivered to your room at no extra charge (although they automatically add tip 18%).The location of this hotel is about 2 blocks off the beaten path but your are just a couple blocks from Washington St. shopping, Quincy Market and a couple T stations. If you can walk a couple blocks to save some money this is the place for you.My two complaints are the size of the rooms - very small - and the size of my bed. I was in a room that had two twin beds and it was like sleeping on cement - cement too short for my 6'1 frame. My feet hung off the end of the bed.One thing that was really nice was the free purified water filling station on each floor - with all the walking we did it was nice to have bottled water at our disposal.

<Content>Very Unsatisfactory Stay Club Quarters is situated in downtown Boston and caters mainly to business travelers. However I think this hotel does not provide even some of the basic amenities that a business traveler needs. There are no safe deposit boxes in the room, they do not deliver newspapers to the room (available only in the 'club room' on the ground floor), iron and ironing-board are not available in the rooms (you need to fetch them from common 'guest closets' and you will be lucky to get one). The rooms are very small and gloomy with inadequate lighting and a very small window. Bathrooms are very small and bare bones. I am not staying here again.

<Content>Overally satisfying experience We stayed at Club Quarters Boston from April 25th to April 27th 2008.We arrived in Boston at 6:30 in the morning of the 26th. We went directly to the hotel because we wanted to leave our luggages there until check-in time - but surprisingly, the room was already available ! It was a very appreciated opportunity since we had just made an exhausting 7 hour bus ride.Otherwise, two things could have been better : the staff and the noise. The staff isn't the friendliest in the world. I don't have any souvenir of a smile or anything like that. They do their job - but that's it. As for the noise, we could easily hear conversations in the bathrooms on other floors and in the corridors. But overally, considering the location  daily rate, negative aspects just aren't that important.If you're staying at Club Quarters during the week-end, keep in mind that you'll have to walk a little to get to restaurants and stores. Since the hotel is located in the heart of Financial District, everything nearby is closed on Saturday and Sunday. But Boston being a relatively small city, pretty much everything is in a reasonnable walking distance.The room size was just fine for two people. Although the bathroom could have easily been a little bigger even to the room's lost, if was very comfortable. To my surprise, there was a fridge and microwave in the room, which happened to be very useful in my case. The room was clean and neat.The proximity of the pub is handy - drinks and beer are great and cheap. Food is pretty good but don't bother getting the brunch on mornings - it's $18 per person for not so many choices. They have a breakfast special - two eggs, a huge sausage, potatoes, beans and toasts for $10. The staff is mostly friendly. Overally, I'd say we had a very good experience at Club Quarters. We recommend it for businness travelers or couples. Not really appropriate for people travelling with children. We'll certainly return to one of the many Club Quarters in the future.

<Content>Okay stay..decent for the price My husband and I decided to stay here for one night, becasue of the great price. We were able to check in early, which was great, and it is very local to everything..able to walk to every attraction. However, we were put on the 2nd floor, and there was wood plywood blocking our entire window. The cleaning staff, was very noisy in the halls, and there was a ton of construction going on.Rooms are very small, the bathroom is extremely tiny! The bed, though is soft and as comfortable as could be!We asked for a taxi to be called, and we were told, they have a long wait, and to walk up the block to the taxi stand.Will not return for a second time.

<Content>Not too bad, just avoid the second floor While this is a business class hotel it does well for the weekend getaway set as well. Rooms are on the small side with a double bed, 19 flat screen TV, and a bathroom with a shower stall only but this fits what most business travelers need. Also it's only a block and a half to the State T station making getting around town easy. The room was clean and well appointed, and the self serve bottled water station on each floor was a nice touchThe only problem we had had more to do with room location than anything else. Our room, 203, was right above where the live music and karaoke are done on Friday and Saturday nights. I don't mean that the room is on the second floor so it's above the Elephant and Castle bar, I mean the microphones and speakers are RIGHT BELOW the room. If you do get that room you may want to request a different one. Also there was someone running a jackhammer at 730 am on a Sunday, but it's the financial district and buildings are being remodeled all the time.Overall I would recommend it based on price and location, but if you're looking for spacious, luxury digs you may want to look somewhere else .

<Content>Convenient and comfortable My mom and I stayed here during Easter weekend, and we loved the location. Really close to the Ts for Downtown Crossing and State Street. Just a few blocks away from Faneuil Hall, and for the prices, it's not bad at all.The rooms are smaller than I'm used to, but it wasn't unbearable. It was actually just fine for two people. The only slight inconvenience was that the ice is only located on the second floor, but there's at least chilled purified water on every floor. The hotel was accommodating to our needing more pillows and washcloths, so yay for that.I'd stay here again!

<Content>Great Location, Excellent Hotel A 4-star rating because of the quality of the rooms, but 3-star for the room sizes.The Lobby, halls  rooms are well decorated and modern, though small. We couldn't hear anything from neighbors, and had great nights of sleep.The hotel is connected to a nice restaurant/pub and close to a small diner.The location is right downtown, and as Boston is pretty small anyway, very close to almost everything.Check my tips.

<Content>Unfriendly Staff Downtown location, fairly moderate price. However, the staff was most unfriendly, barely courteous. It should be pointed out that English was a second language for the majority of the staff. The attached pub served mediocre food  check your bill!Mrs. W. BrackenPenn Valley, CA

<Content>A pleasant surprise! I had never stayed at a Club Quartes before, and was slightly wary of the budget accomodations, but needed a place for one night so I took a chance. I was very pleased with my choice. It is located on a side street in an old building very near Faneuil Hall, Quincey Market, and the aquarium. Check in was done by machine (a first for me) but there is someone at the desk 24/7 to help if needed. The lobby was small but nice and there was a large club room open to all adjacent to it that was plush and comfortable. The hallways were narrow as is typical in this type of building. My room was smallish (although I have been in much smaller rooms!) , cute, and very well appointed. It was very cleverly designed to make the most of the space and to soundproof the walls of adjoining rooms. Everything (TV, microwave, phone, bed) seemed fairly new. I loved the self serve water bottle bar in the hallway. The next morning I was able to leave my bags for $1/bag while I roamed around. I arrived late in the evening after the kitchen in the adjoining restaurant closed and there were no other nearby restaurants which didn't upset me much but would certainly present a problem for the hungry or those with kids. The wireless wasn't working the night I was there which was a disappointment to me. Some reviewers have commented on the noise but to me it was just big city noise; coming from SF I wasn't bothered. I did occasionally hear a noise from the hallway that I might not have heard in a larger or newer establishment but the price and charm of this hotel far outweighed any negatives.

<Content>Club Quarters quite satisfactory Two of us (early 60鈥檚) stayed one night (Room 708). We thought the accommodations and location just fine - about a fifteen minute walk to the theater district, and less than ten minutes from the Boston Common or the Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market area. (taxis can be called by the desk person.)Self check-in (if the machine works), otherwise, very pleasant assistance. In fact, during our short stay, each of the desk personnel was kind and helpful.The room was clean and basic, with a shower (no bathtub). We found the size of the room just fine; the 鈥渜ueen鈥?bed seemed a little small (but I hadn鈥檛 brought a ruler to check.) There was a work desk and chair, and a more comfortable 鈥渨ork style鈥?upholstered chair, as well. There was a coffee/tea machine, too.Although the lobby itself is small, there is a 鈥渃lub room attached with attractive furnishings, a gas fireplace, and two 鈥渇ree鈥?internet-accessible computers. In the afternoon of this weekend day, cookies were set out.The attached/associated restaurant, The Elephant and Castle, as the name suggests, was decorated as an English pub, with several TV sets (tuned to English football while we were there). We had a lunch there, choosing from the 鈥淧ub fare鈥?menu, and enjoyed the food. Curiously, we thought that the prices were just what we would have paid in London, in dollars. If your goal is to be out and about downtown Boston, why pay more for a fancier room? We鈥檒l check this out next time, too.

<Content>Great place - great location! We booked a studio room with kitchenette for a recent 4 night stay. Location in Financial District is quiet on the weekends but the next door restaurantpub 'Elephant and Castle' is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They also have good beer on tap! Room was adequate with 1 queen bed; small bathroom with nominal amenities which during a 4 night stay were never replenished, not even the soap!. We had to ask for extra towels as all was set up for single occupancy despite booking for two. Kitchenette with coffee maker, microwave, potspans, dishes and silverware for 3 but no paper towels nor tea towel for cleaning up. Free WiFi in room; TV channel choice fairly basic with no premium channels. Good security at front desk, room key card needed to use elevator as well as for room entry. Overall good product, a bit more attention from housekeeping is in order though.

<Content>Ok! Stayed in this hotel for a week in November. It's clean and basic and we thought it was worth the money we paid (we got a GREAT deal). On checkin, they just took the credit card, then gave us a room keycard - didn't show us where the lift was, didn't tell us our room number - just said next please. The reception staff seemed to be put out if we asked them for directions or had general queries etc. so we had trouble that way trying to plan our day because we had no help from them. The location is good, you're right in the financial district, about a five minute walk to downtown crossing and fanueil hall.

<Content>Bring earplugs to get thru it I just spent the last 2 nights at this hotel. You can hear every person walking down the hall and even hear the TV in the room next to you. People would come in at midnight and 2am talking like they were in the same room with me. There is absolutely NO insulation between walls or doors in these rooms. The rooms are absolutely tiny. You feel like you are staying in a dorm room. Not to mention, the staff is rude and make you feel like you are bothering them asking for directions. Don't bother!

<Content>Would stay here again! I wasn't sure what to expect from Club Quarters because I paid so little compared to other area hotels. Well, I ended up pleasantly surprised! I booked this hotel for one night because it was so close to TD Banknorth Garden.Upon arrival I used the self-check-in kiosk and it was quite fast. I hopped on the elevator and was a little confused at first... you have to first slide your room key and then choose your floor. When you get off the elevator there is free bottled water to your right, very nice touch.We stayed on the 9th floor in a street facing room. The room was small, but for two people we didn't need a ton of space. The bed had clean linens and was quite comfy. The bathroom was clean and offered soap, shampoo and mouthwash. The shower was very tiny, our bathroom got a little flooded because the curtain was so small. The room also had a flatscreen tv.I loved how quiet this hotel was! Often when I stay in hotels I am woken up by the other guests because of thin walls or by room service. However, we were able to sleep late and never heard another person in the hotel. Also, check out is 12 which is considerably later than a lot of the other hotels in downtown.I would definitely stay here again! It was a pleasant stay and great deal.

<Content>In the Club A very good, clean and centrally located hotel in the financial centre of the city. Easy to get to the local tourist sites. I can recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a central location to stay. Easy to get to and from the airport from the State T station. Internet access is available in the lounge for free.

<Content>Great Hotel We purchased a night at the Club Quarters thru Priceline and we were not sure what to expect after reading the reviews of how small and other negative comments. We arrived on Friday November 2nd at 11:15 AM and we were pleasantly surprised to find our room was ready. The room was equipped with fridge, microwave and sink. The bathroom was small but suited us just fine. We walked to Quincy Market(5 minute walk) and to the theatre district, 10 minute walk and the shopping on Washington Street was a block away, everything was nicely located.I would recommend this hotel to anyone and the staff was great.

<Content>Would Stay Here Again! I read the reviews on here and was a little skeptical given the competitive price....first stay at a club quarters and based on this stay i'd do it again. I'm widely travelled and have stayed at many a very very nice hotel. This hotel was in a great location, clean and relatively quiet. No view for me whatsoever...but I was looking for a business place to stay that was convenient and reasonable and within walking distance to the convention center (25 min one way)...,net net i'd stay here again...it was all good!

<Content>Great location, very clean VERY VERY small room. Reminds me of a single dorm room back in college. However, it was very clean and new. My room overlooked Devonshire on the 2nd floor. I wish the windows had reflecting film so people could not see in from the building opposite. Wireless internet was bad from my room. Barely made connections. Good thing was a delivery menu available. It was great for when I came back to the room tired.No parking. Parking is on Arch Street and is very expensive.Great location. I walked to Fanueil Hall and Prudential Center. The old state house was just a stone throw away.

<Content>Prime location, esp for tourists Room was small, but as expected for a downtown hotel and quite comfortable. Most Boston tourist attractions (and a couple of T stations) are a short walk away and airport access is a breeze. Facilities are not lavish, but provided what was needed. I can fully recommend this hotel.

<Content>Okay, not 'luxury'. The hotel is in a good location for walking. The financial area goes 'dead' after quitting time so you'll have to walk over to Fanueil Square for any action or restaurants. Only about a ten minute walk.Location is good. Cleanliness was okay. Don't expect anything resembling a great, luxurious experience. It's more like a nice dorm. If you want romantic and impressive, go elsewhere, but this is certainly adequate for business travelers or vacationers who just want a nice, clean place to stay. Service was good and friendly. when I asked for a roll away bed in the morning, it was there in the room when I came back from my day's activities.Again, don't expect luxury, but it was cheaper than some hotels and it was easy to get places. Close walk to subways, South Station etc. You can walk to the North End for Italian dinners. Weekends are packed. Get to a restaurant early because by 8pm you'll have at least an hour or hour and a half wait to get in anywhere.If you're traveling by yourself or with one other person, this could work. As long as you're not expecting marble tiled bathrooms with separate dressing area and 42 plasma screen tvs. And the pillows were sort of iffy. Like a pile of foam pieces stuffed inside a bag. Still.... okay.

<Content>Adequate but Housekeeping Could Improve My room was fairly small but adequate and the bed was comfortable. I was very close to the elevator but fortunately the other guests were considerate. The club room, with computers for guest use, was a nice touch. My main concern was the poor housekeeping. Although the room was clean enough, it was clear that the housekeeping staff did very little to provide for the guests. When I arrived, I found a tiny tube of shampoo and a little bottle of mouthwash. Once they were gone, they were never replaced despite my request to the front desk. A sign on the bed says the sheets are changed every other day but mine were not changed during a 5 day stay. Although towels are supposed to changed every other day, mine were changed only if I placed them on the floor of the shower. The day I did this, I received two bath mats but no hand towel or washcloth. Coffee making supplies are minimal and not always refilled. To get more, you have to go to a closet on the floor. This hotel would be fine for a night or two but it became rather tiresome after a full week. It is woefully understaffed and this shows up in the level of service.

<Content>A great relief to a long journey. I had flown to Boston from Wellington New Zealand to embark on a cruise from there. The time taken was 17 hours in the air and I was nearing exaustion. ( I am 75)....A welcome arrival, easy registering on a computer, A great room and most of all a bed that was not flying at hundreds of miles an hour. Luggage at Boston Airport was 1 1/2 hours coming off so that just added to my woes, nonethe less my experience was all good and the coffee shop right next door was fabulous. I MUST have been jetlagged as afterwads I could not find my room, I was in 3 19 and looked for 913...Found it soon enough. Lost the rubber tip from my cane but the obliging desk clerk returned to my room and found it under the bed just as the taxi arrived. Altogether a most satisfing stay and I would recommend the hotel to anyone.

<Content>Small with no frills We stayed one night to be near a wedding. Since we have two kids ages 14 and 11, we chose a suite. Well the suite was smaller than any single hotel room we had ever seen. The double bed was okay, but the pullout sofa was shear torture. The bathroom was extremely small and only included a shower stall. The TV on the wall, with a swing arm bracket, was nice and the fridge and microwave were efficient. The room was clean. The staff was minimal.

<Content>Great Place, helpful staff and amazing beds We went to Boston for the Wine Expo and all the hotels near the trade center were either completely booked or ridiculously expensive. After a search online, we decided to give the Club Quarters a chance. We absolutely love the hotel. It was a short walk from the bus terminal. Once we reached the hotel, the front desk was very helpful and check-in was quick. The room was small but the layout of the room provides for max space and felt really cozy. The room was very clean and modern. The bed sheets and the comforters were the best; I had the best sleep ever. Can't wait to visit again!

<Content>Club Quarter's Boston..Great hotel, great location Great hotel, great location. Minutes walk from Fanueil Hall and many other attractions. Hotel is a little tricky to find, just look for the Elephant ant Castle Pub which is connected to it. They offer reduced parking 2 blocks away and you can easily cut through the pub to save walking. Rooms were very nice and clean. Shockingly, each floor offers free bottled water.....instead of $4.00 for a liter like most chain hotels. The club room on the first floor offers coffee, tea and has 2 computers (with printers) available at all times. All in all, I couldn't have been happier for the price that I paid. ($80 priceline)

<Content>Efficiently excellent This is a far more pleasant place to stay than the nearby, very expensive Ritz Carlton, at one-third the price, where we stayed several days before sampling the Club Quarters on our return trip. True, you don't have tje R-C's snotty help condescending to extend faux cheery good mornings, but you have more comfortable rooms at one-third the price. Instead of a sterile, incredibly expensive dining room ($65 for a mediocre breakfast for two), you get a reasonably priced meal in a cheery adjacent pub. The exercise room is not as fancy, but it's free, as opposed to the R-C's $25, and you optionally can have a stationary bicycle or elliptical machine delivered to your room, for free of course. If you enjoy in-room coffee, forget the R-C, which doesn't have it, and go to the Club Quarters, which has an unlimited supply. True, the R-C has fast 801.2g wifi, while the Club Quarters has (rather inexcusably) only the slow (11 mbs) 801.2b wifi, but the R-C charges $10 a day, while the Club Quarters provides it for free. Anyway, the R-C's nominal fast internet frequently slows to levels slower than dialup (10-15 kps), so it doesn't matter.The Club Quarters is not perfect, of course. Something is wrong with the TV system (which is the exact same as at the R-C), so that it is hard to find services other than the standard TV stations. It says it offers HD TV, but I couldn't find it.. However, the Club Quarters offered two wide-screen plasma TV's while the R-C has one, standard TV. While the Club Quaters TV has extensive inputs for PC's, they appear to have been disabled. (The Ritz Carlton had no such inputs). Exterior lights bathe the windows, so the curtains must be drawn at night. The Air Conditioning is quite noisy.But, even without the associated major savings, the Club Quarters is the superior hotel.

<Content>Rent a bed I stayed at the Club Quarters for 6 days. The service at the front desk is overall poor. Examples of poor delivery during my stay include the following:1. The room was never dusted. a banana peel sat on the counter for 4 days2. I was evicted from their only public area/business center which was used as the overflow for their restaurant. This was done without a posted notice and with no regard to basic hospitality practices. Left without a place where to charge my laptop I was forced to conduct a conference call from the nearest Dunkin Donuts. This was done after I had checked out early as a courtesy to the hotel to allow them to prepare rooms during a very busy Friday3 I left towels in the shower floor to be replaced only to find the same pile and new towels stacked on top of my side chair.4. I waited in the pub to be acknowledged or sat down for 20 minutes. Nobody even made eye contact with meThe hotel does not effectively cater to the business travel. Poorly managed and a shame to the Club Quarters organization

<Content>Poor attention to detail The place had nice amenities but lacked attention to detail. There was a provided blow dryer and (poor tasting) mouthwash, but no lotion or conditioner. There was mold on the shower curtain. The promised bathrobe was missing. The free internet had such a weak signal that I had to go to the lobby to check email. The place could be nice but it needs better managing.

<Content>not so great stayed 2 nites over mother's day weekend. the rooms are very small, but comfortable, clean, and modern. the staff not helpful. we saw parking out on the street and asked advice from the desk. their response was they didn't know anything about it. we wound up getting two tickets, i think the signs were not clear and we couldn't get an answer from the desk , so it wasn't such a bargain after all. also, the area surrounding the hotel is very desserted on the weekends, and we got the feeling it wasn't so safe to be walking around there at night. we wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Was perfect for us! We were in Boston for a weekend and the Club Quarters was perfect for our stay. It was in a great location...walking distance to all the sights we wanted to see (Freedom trail, Quincy Market, T stop to Fenway) Modern rooms with comfy bed. On the small size, the bathroom as well (especially the shower) but we aren't too picky so it worked out great. It is mainly a business travelers' hotel so it wouldn't be good for families. It is located in the financial district and none of the cafes and coffee shops (even starbucks!) are open on weekends. But just a quick walk to the market and there is plenty to choose from.

<Content>Good Hotel Enjoyed stay at hotel. Very good for single people and couples. Probably not a good family hotel. Very modern design. Only complaints are that you have to flush the toliet several times for it to flush completely, a weird noise in room throughout stay, think from the A/C even though heard noise when A/C off, and no water bottles for their complimentary water bottle stations. Otherwise, enjoyed my stay there very much. Very good location for sightseeing, in a generally quiet area. Just a 5 minute walk or so from Quincey Market if you take the direct route (was going the long way for 2 days before we realized there was a shorter route). Very comfortable bed and pillows. Nice modern TV. And a wrap around counter in bathroom leaves a good amount of space for 2 people's stuff. Felt very safe at location. Also a good hairdryer, not one of those tiny underpowered cheap ones you usually see in hotels. Would recommend to a friend.

<Content>Just awful I wasn't able to sleep at this hotel. The door between rooms was not sound-proofed, and TV in the adjoining room was turned up all the way. Though I called the front desk twice about it, they were unable to hear the TV from the hallway and therefore didn't do anything about it. I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very average, staff is not friendly I stayed here for 2 nights booked by a company for which I was doing some consulting work. The actual rooms are pretty nice, with flat-screen TVs and nice beds. Like others have said, the bathrooms do not have tubs, just showers. The bathrooms are relatively clean, but definitely worn from use. The staff is not particularly helpful, and the services such as WiFi cannot be counted on to work when you are there.If you don't expect too much, you won't be let down.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised After reading the reviews, I was a little wary, but given the price, Club Quarters went beyond my expectations. The location could not be more convenient, and the recently renovated rooms boast granite counters, a small flat screen TV, and free wireless  printing. The hotel supplies free bottled water, which is a nice extra. Some warnings: the rooms are small (think Manhattan small) and are best suited for 1 or 2 adults, rather than families. Parking is 2 blocks away and runs $10/night on weekends ($8 with hotel validation). Our check in was late at night on a Friday of a busy holiday weekend, and the on duty staff person was incredibly helpful. However, he was an exception - the staff we talked to during the rest of our stay couldn't be less interested in being of assistance.

<Content>Staff are RUDE Ok, I love the Club Quarters in Boston it is a quick walk almost anywhere near Fanueil Hall. However, the staff were soooooo rude. This had never happened to us before and I have to wonder if the woman on duty was just having a bad day. We decided to stay an extra night and the woman acted like she was doing me a giant favor though... she didn't speak to me the WHOLE time... not one word. I will stay there again because it is a bargain.

<Content>Pleasantly satisfied Stayed here for one night on business. I wasn't expecting much, basedon comments some of my colleagues have made about other CQ properties, but my stay was fine. The room was of adequate size and nicely decorated, and the bed was comfortable (a single queen-size... not a king). The bathroom was clean -- it had a stall shower (no tub). No view to speak of, and I could hear a fair amount of noise from both the hallway and the alley outside (even though I was on a high floor), but it was tolerable. The armchair wasn't your typical cushy hotel chair, but rather a fairly small upholstered chair with a wooden desk as one of the arms -- and there was no table other than the desk surface or a nightstand. There's free filtered water on each floor, with plastic bottles to take it to go -- a nice touch. If you need an iron and ironing board, you have to get it from a closet down the hall. The attached Elephant  Castle offers room service delivery, which was nice... but their menu isn't the greatest. For the price ($125), I think Club Quarters was a great deal and I would stay here again.

<Content>Do yourself a favor...look elsewhere Went on a short business trip to Boston and did not have a good experience with this hotel. The people at the main desk were rude (two of them on different days!).The promised free wireless did not work at nights. The night people didn't know how to reset it properly. One of them told me she wouldn't do it because it would kick anyone else who was online on my floor off the network...Given that I had work to do, I insisted over the course of a half hour. An hour later (and several calls), I was told that it was reset. It still didn't work. Then she told me that the system was actually broken and had been for a while (it worked during the day of course). What am I 10 years old?The walls were paper thin and the staff (never mind other patrons) was loud in the hallway.The shower was a joke. The water pressure was basically just gravity.In all, it sucked. I won't do it again, and can't recommend it to anyone else either.

<Content>Streamlined Perfection Great location. I was able to walk to Government Center, North Station, Faneuil Hall, South Station, The Common, Newbury Street. Room was small by U.S. standards but very clean and well appointed. Shower only no tub. Great water pressure. Comfortable bed. Checkin via machine makes the process a breeze. The checkout machines did not work the morning I left but I was out of there in less than a minute.

<Content>Worth the stay With CQ member privileges, staying at the CQ-Boston ($75 for double occupancy) was a no-brainer after looking at other comparable hotels' prices. Still, I was a little nervous after reading some reviewers' complaints.I'm not sure if we stayed at the same hotel. All of the front desk staff was extremely helpful, incl a friendly staffer who helped out with a late-night food order when I realized that there were no restaurants open nearby. I had arrived late and the staff took care of my luggage so I could meet a friend for drinks at the connecting bar. Having the Elephant and Castle right under the hotel was great. I had plenty of chances for a quick drink after a day of sightseeing or a quick coffee before starting. CQ's location was more than convenient - two blocks from a T-stop (the line with a direct stop at the airport) and just a few blocks from Quincy Market, the Freedom Trail, the Aquarium, Fanheuil (sp?) Hall. I even walked to Newberry Street without a fuss.The jr room was spacious, with an open central area and a large bathroom (though it had a standing shower and not a tub). Enjoyed the flat-screen tv and free Wifi, though I didn't hang out in the room much, and the bed was comfortable.All in all, I'm not sure what other guests were looking for but I found quite the deal with the CQ-Boston and am sure the next time I head to Boston that I'll stay here again.

<Content>no water in the club quarters Had a one night stay, there was no water for 5 hrs. Had no recourse but to submit, when checking in, had no where else to go, was late to an appointment, could not shower, flush toilet etc. Still, was charged full price, and no apology, just snotty attitude, I'm nobody, no one. People take my money, but I just don't matter :(

<Content>Loved the Hotel, Great location! This Hotel surprised us a lot after poor quality hotels in New York. Room was very spacious, great conditoin (flat screen TV!), big bed, very clean bathroom. We had really pleasant stay. Nice bar with good food - just beside reception (separate entrance). Location was another winner - in the heart of Boston. Nearly perfect except - one rude lady at the reception desk. What a pity as most of the hotel staff was really friendly. Anyway I would go back to this hotel if I'll ever visit Boston again. Charming city!!!

<Content>Excellent stay, great value Location and price are very hard to beat, even independtly of each other. I recommend the hotel for anybody, although it is really a hotel targetting business travelers. It is very modern, clean, efficient. Excellent value, too. It has nice touches like the free water bottles you can take along and the free wireless or the free printing facility. The rooms are not very large, but that should not be an issue in Boston I guess. Best of all is the location, literally just a few steps from the State station of the T. You could not be more central, it is really surprisingly good value for money. I have never stayed at a better value-for-money place in Boston.

<Content>Better off going Priceline....4 star hotel (Copley Marriott) for $99 vs. $139 Barebones hotel with uncomfortable beds. Elevators are frequently very slow as well. For the price, I would go to Price line and put in 3 star hotel for a lower price. Chances are you will get a MUCH better hotel for less money. I have stayed here before because I thought it was an inexpensive way to stay in the city. In reality, you can do better. We got Thursday and Friday night rooms for $99 at the Copley Marriott. Basic Club Quarter rooms for the same nights were $139 a night.

<Content>Adequate Hotel; Poor Service Stayed at Club Quarters during a Saturday night in January. First impression of this place was the service was very rude. Upon arrival my boyfriend asked the check-in clerk whether he would be okay parking on the street in front of the hotel. Our reply was a mumbled,  I don't know, you have to read the signs. Shouldn't it be the job of the hotel staff to be able to answer these questions? The staff was neither helpful or accomodating. Check-in took longer than necessary, even though we were the only ones checking-in at the time. And the clerk neglected to tell us you had to put your room key in the elevator in order to get to your floor. The room was fine. Clean. Small, but adequate. Fine for a one night stay. Short on supplies (ie. one towel). I found the bed to be uncomfortable. And the jack-hammering the next morning outside did not help my restless sleep. The price - $86/night could not be beat. This is probably due to the fact that the hotel is located in the Financial District which during the weekend is dead. This hotel is good for the business traveler or budget conscious. But based on the poor service, I would not go back.

<Content>Absolutely horrible night I had the most horrible experience staying in that hotel. The rooms are tiny, but more importantly, one can hear everything coming from the neighboring rooms as there are huge gaps under the doors. But not just hear, also feel! I did not get a minute of sleep for several hours after 1 am, as I had several very vocal couples in the rooms next to mine. I could hear everything, and also my bed was shaking! Apparently the walls are not very thick and the beds are attached to the walls. I noticed that there were only about 3 rooms occupied on that floor, and for some reason, all guests were assigned to the rooms closely adjacent to each other. The heating system in the rooms had only two functioning settings, on and off, which meant temperatures rivalling Sahara desert, or a pitch cold room. Hairdryer in the bathroom was not working. The staff in the front desk were as intrusive and rude as possible. I am a 40 yr woman working in higher education, stayed in that hotel alone, and had the worst hotel experience of my life.

<Content>Loved Club Quarters We had a wonderful experience in this hotel. The room was spacious and very clean. The plasma TV on the wall was a very nice and unexpected touch as this is not an expensive hotel and quite the contrary, as the price was so good, we really did not anticipate such nice accomodations and excellent location. The room had designer bedding, and was very comfortable. This is definitely a no-frills hotel but that is fine with us as there is so much to see in Boston, we did not anticipate using any hotel amenities. We care about comfort and service, and they offered plenty of that. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We had to rely on them numerous times for assistance concerning travel around town and they went out of their way to be accomodating. The breakfast next door in the pub was very no-frills, but as it was complimentary, we could not complain. This hotel is literally within two blocks walking distance to Fanuil Hall, and just blocks from the Freedom Trail and the Waterfront. Overall, we highly recommend Club Quarters and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Good Hotel - great value Stayed for 4 nights on a mixed business/tourist trip. Check-in and check-out were via automated system, so other than getting a cab called to the airport I had no interaction at all with the staff - which suited me fine.Room was smallish - fine for 2 of us but I would imagine perfect if one was on one's own. Aside from the bed and a fridge, there was a small desk and chair. Very small bathroom (not much more than a closet!), but again fine. I did notice a bit of noise through the door to the hallway, and especially from the elevators - which beeped away all night. On the third floor I noticed that there was a room right beside the elevators. If you had this room my advice would be to head straight to reception and demand another as I think it could be very noisy.Elevators also got ridiculously busy in the mornings, and it's one of those hotels that don't have stair access to the lobby. So despite being only 2 floors from ground I had to let 4 full elevator cars pass before I could fit in one. A small problem but annoying when it happens every morning! Attached Elephant and Castle pub was friendly and efficient place for snacks and drinks, and very handy given that the hotel is in a quiet business district with not a lot else to hand.Two blocks from Government Center T-stop, and 10 min walk to Park St so it was pretty easy to get around. But then it's pretty easy to get around Boston anyway. Also easy walking distance for Boston Common, Faneuil Hall, so location pretty good.Best feature however was the cost, this moves this hotel from average to above average. Very decent rate ($100 I think), especially at the weekend when the business travellers move out. It also seems to be a bit of a hidden gem. I've frequently found vacancies at the Club Quarters when all the Back Bay hotels have been full.Given the choice I'd probably stay somewhere else, but if I was on a budget and looking for a good, clean, place to stay it would be top of my list.

<Content>Visit left me cold Stayed for one night during October 2006. The duty receptionist neglected to tell us and other guests, there was no hot water in the hotel - cold shower and shave. When I checked with the receptionist it seems that this had been the situation for anything upto 3 weeks, since a pipe had been dug up in the adjacent street. Difficult to determine the exact period this problem had existed due to the poor English of the receptionist and his obvious lack of concern.Lots of work taking place in the streets around the hotel and the double glazing did not provide sufficient noise reduction to allow my wife much sleep, I reverted to ear plugs.For businessmen/women the rooms were modern, functional and clean.

<Content>clean and quiet This hotel is definitly geared to the business traveler, we were there on pleasure. Check in and check out were slow due to problems with the automated system and they don't have the desk staff to handle everyone manually. This is one of the quietest hotels I've ever stayed in which is much appreciated as I am a light sleeper. The bathroom is too small for 2 people to use at the same time. The room was small but not especially for Boston. While the business traveller will appreciate the wireless connection, etc. for the pleasure traveller the room felt stripped down. We got a good deal through priceline, but when I called to make sure I had a non smoking room, the person gave me attitude about booking through priceline. Also the number for the hotel was listed incorrectly (I'm assuming it was an incorrect number since it rings and rings and no one answers). It took some detective work to find the real number.In the future I'll limit myself to 4 stars.

<Content>The most Incompetent Customer Service ever This hotel was flooded on October 7, 2006 by a water main break. We were scheduled to stay on October 8 and luckily saw this on the news and cancelled our reservation by calling customer service. We followed up twice to confirm our concellation because the people we spoke to sounded so clueless that we had an uneasy feeling. A week later (of course) we were charged for our room. I spent a few hours on the phone with these people once again and they still have not agreed to reverse my charge (yet). I've never dealt with such incompetence - the desk staff sound like they were just pulled off the street and are so clueless. Since this chain's member services are operated out of a single location, and I have called and spoken to at least a half dozen of these people, I can only assume that this whole operation is bush league. Avoid all of these hotels

<Content>Club Quarters Lacking The hotel was extremely difficult to locate. The directions we received from booking were incorrect. Locals, including police , could not help and the hotel gave inaccurate derections as well.We were in the correct neighborhood and took 2 hours to locate the hotel. There is no on site parking. Parking is nearby but upon departure we had to pay $60 for 22 hours of parking. The hotel did not offer us any validation to decrease cost.Hotel was nice but suprisingly sparse. Only one towel per guest with no washcloths or hand towels. Coffee maker was for one cup only. The room was clean and comfortable, but the view was of the back of a building. The attached restaurant was goodand the staff willingly changed our room when we were assigned twin beds.

<Content>Nice hotel This was my second stay at Club Quarters in Boston and I like this hotel. I stayed two night from Saturday Sept 23, 2006 to Monday Sept 25, 2006. Price was US$119 per night plus tax (US$267.62 for the two nights including taxes)..I arrived early as I had just come off a cruise ship. No problem getting into my room straight away. I was in room 213. Fitness centre was just down the hall. Room was clean and I liked the flat screen TV. Room and bathroom were quite small but a lot larger than the cabin that I had on the ship.Coffee machine in the room with extra free supplies of coffee and tea in the hall closetNice lounge with free internet use.I had the Sunday breakfast buffet next door in the Elephant  Castle. US$16 per person. Good selection and friendly service..The hotel location is excellent and close to the Freedom trail and all its attractions. State metro is close by and it is just 3 stops to the airport.I like Club Quarters automated check in/out. It is quick, efficient and avoids having to wait in line at reception.Room was quiet being the weekend but even on Monday morning there was little noise.Overall, an enjoyable stay at a good price and I will stay there again.andrew

Yes the walls were abit thin but it didn't bother me enough to keep me up at night or interrupt my work! Great location, walking distance to the Downtown crossing T and CVS, MAcy's, Filene's Basement, etc. The gym equipment could definitely use an upgrade though...will definitely come back!=)

I was waiting 10 min at the erception desk for the guy to figure out whether there was a clean room available or not. That place is a mess. Rooms are clean and nice, but bear in mind you just pay for lodging, service does not seem to be included.

<Content>Decent hotel in a great location I stayed at the Club Quarters Hotel in Boston for three nights from 08/18-08/21, while on vaction with my girlfriend. The hotel room was extremely small, but adequate. The shower is barely large enough for one person to fit in. The room was extremely clean and the bed was comfortable. We didn't hear any noise from other rooms, however the noise of other passing guests in the hallways was clearly evident and obnoxiously loud at times. The hotel is located in the financial district which is quiet on the weekends other than other tourists who are milling around. The hotel is in an excellent location for tourists as it is only a couple of blocks from the freedom trail, the T (Subway), and a short walk to the north end (Little Italy section). The area appears very safe with the exception of a few homeless individuals. We parked our car in the hotel's recommended parking garage a block away and it was $40 for the three nights (You park your own car and have the ticket validated by the hotel desk for a discount.) Getting to Fenway Park for the Yankees' victory was easy. The hotel staff was friendly and accomodating.We ate at the restaurant next to the hotel (Elephant and Castle) for breakfast one morning. I equate it to airport food. It was quick and edible, but not the best food we've ever had.  I paid $180 a night on Price Line and I'd say that was a fair price. You're primarily paying for the location, not the hotel amenities.Try Abe  Louie's if you're looking for a great steakhouse that's on the expensive side. It's a $9 cab ride away and well worth the trip if you can afford the tab ($190 for two with wine and tip.) The freedom trail was very interesting and I highly recommend it. It's approximately 3 miles of walking with many historical sites along the way. It also takes you past many interesting shops as well as great restaurants.Boston was a nice trip that was definitely worth taking.

<Content>Clean, Comfortable, Courteous My husband and I just got back from a weekend in Boston. We paid $125 per nigh through priceline and had a GREAT experience there. The men at the front desk were very helpful with food reccomendations and they gave us an upgrade to a suite. The room was very nice with a cool flat screen tv. The suite has a microwave, bar sink and small refrigerator. I must say that the bathroom was a little small.The Elephant and Castle bar adjacent to the hotel had great food and good entertainment on the weekend. We spend most of our time out on the wharf and Faneuil Hall. It was a quick walk, less than a mile. The area was clean and safe. For the money I spent, I got a great value, great service and had a wonderful time!

<Content>Reasonable price, reasonable hotel. We stayed here for 3 nights in the July heatwave. The rooms were fine - clean, not overly-spacious but big enough. They do seem to have a problem with towels here! We had to ask for extras as they only provided enough for one person and even again on the 2nd day when housekeeping removed 2 sets and replaced only 1. We thought the restaurant and bar next door were over-priced and the quality of the food was average at best. The hotel itself is within walking distance of most attractions - if you enjoy walking (we do). The area felt perfectly safe to me. I think we must have missed the 'breakfasts' in the morning - there was coffee and usually cookies but nothing else (7am - 8am).

<Content>have a plan " b" I flew into BOS from cross country. arrived鈥ired obviously, went to the hotel at 10 and was told that my room was sold to someone else! I guess a first time for everything, totally screwed? The idiot at the counter (desk at a real hotel) was completely unapologetic and clueless. Someone before be screwed this up鈥tc...a total b.s. anwer. In a very immature manner, the manager on duty blamed it on an imaginary character and tried to reason with me that they gave my room to someone that didn't want to leave. Blamed it on pinky Massachusetts law, the man, e.g. a guest that refused to leave. They offered to put me up in the wilderness at my own expense, 20 miles out of town, when my biz was local and necessarily close to the hotel. I refused and found my own accommodations at a youth hostel (in my suit and tie:), ah the collegiate memories. Next day, I re-arrive at the hotel (no more hostels!) for my second reservation. A 3$ bottle of wine awaits me with a lame excuse, parden me sir for the cluster I created last evening鈥tc. FYI MOD absolutely ignored my previous phone messages to him until 6PM (after he or she thought I'd drink the crappy box of wine, which I did not drink and left for housekeeping) however I was sleeping off the previous nights bad night sleep most the evening.There is even more to say in this story, however, I am ready to sleep. Last note to leave the shopper with: this second night I was outside of the hotel to have a smoke, noticed that the same MOD as last night was outside with a smoke himself. He had a sheet of hotel numbers in his hand again; they oversold again (MOD was on the phone looking for other places with rooms). This is their modus operandi, way of doing things. Do not stay here, on business or pleasure, if you have a choice.~Dzzzzz

<Content>Very Nice My 13 year old son  I spent the night in Boston before we tookthe Amtrak to Maine the next day. They don't have 2 dbl bedsbut have rollways, so I reserved a full and rollway. Wanted to be near Fanuil Hall and Quincy Market. Very modern! Flat screenTV, nice clean bathroom,comfortable mattress. Rooms are smallbut nice,definately for one person,though! If I came to visit aloneI'd stay here again. One disappointment no mini fridge in room! They do have a nice restaurant  Pub attached. Watched the Red Sox game, while my son watched a movie in the room.They also serve breakfast in the morning. Took a cab to North station the folling morning.Kind of far to walk.

<Content>Great value! We stayed here for 3 nights over 4th July 2006, and were really pleased with both the location and the hotel itself.When we arrived the lobby was a little chaotic - but its a small lobby and this was probably their busiest weekend of the year and we checked in fine with no hitches. On arrival day there was only one elevator working - our room was only the the 2nd floor so we would have happily taken the stairs but we were told that there were not any that we could use - so we were left to wait around a lot for the remaining working elevator. The elevator was fixed after about 36 hours and this was only a minor inconvenience so we were not too concerned.Our room was a good size, nicely decorated, very clean and with a very comfortable bed. Our room was at the front of the building overlooking the street and on just the 2nd floor - but the street was so quiet that it did not disturb us at all. The lounge was pleasant and nicely furnished with a big TV, 2 computers with free internet and lots of leaflets and magazines with local information.Location was great - near to the Freedom Trail, marketplace, downtown etc and just a few minutes walk from a subway station (just 3 stops to the airport). Generally the street and the area felt very safe, both in day and evening time.The Elephant and Castle next door was convenient - we ate there on our first night as we had arrived late and found the staff friendly, the food good and the service quick. They were however closing down for a few weeks for refurbishment when we were there.Overall, if you are looking for a functional, convenient, affordable hotel in central Boston this is the place for you!

<Content>Easy Access to all Going through Hotwire, we found ourselves with a room at this hotel. After reading some of the reviews, I expected the worse. Surprise! The staff, while not the most engaging, were not rude at all. They were helpful and responded quickly to our concerns. We liked the room we were given..yes, it was small but it was quiet, clean, the bathroom was more than adequate (though they could be a little more generous with the towels), and the bed was very comfortable. Since I am not that fond of constant air-conditioning, the ability to open the window was a plus! And free wireless internet is always a welcome treat. Coffee, juices, and breakfast fare (cookies, fruit, muffins and danishes) were available in the Club Room in the morning. And while parking is not free, a 20% discount is available with the hotel's validation of your ticket.We were able to walk easily to most sights--the Common, North End, Quincy Market-- and the various T lines were just a short walk away.I would have rated this hotel above average but because the hotel is located in the Financial District, I did feel some trepidation walking back there at night. It was a little too quiet and desolate for me, even when walking with my husband. (Otherwise, the area did appear very safe).

<Content>perfect for crashing I stayed at Club Quarters Boston for 3 nights end of May. I had read the mixed reviews on this site and was a little apprenhensive. All in all it was absolutely fine: I had trouble checking in but I think that was Orbitz rather than the hotel itself. The lady behind the desk was efficient and invited me to wait in their club room while she sorted it out. The room itself was larger than expected, comfy bed and the bathroom was above average - ok you get a shower rather than a bath but who's going to be relaxing in a bath all night if you're in town to see the sights? I liked the very modern flat screen TV and the room was quiet EXCEPT for the g*d damn elevator bell ringing every time the elevator passed the eighth floor, regardless of whether it stopped or not. Tip: do not stay in any of 01 rooms ie 301, 801 - you'll get the elevator bell 24/7.I only ordered room service once which was breakfast on Sunday morning provided by the pub next door. It was ok but nothing spectacular. I wasn't that bothered myself as I was purely using the hotel as a place to sleep and freshen up. If I had been spending more time in my hotel or staying longer I'd probably go somewhere else. The staff were friendly and efficient and the location was FANTASTIC - less than 5 mins walk to Quincy market. Recommended.

<Content>Luxurious? No. Location? Great. P If you're looking for a grand club quarters experience, you'll find the understaffed Club Quarters Boston isn't going to make you stay amazing. The location, however, compared to suburbian hotels for just fifty dollars less a night in many cases, will make your stay here worth it! You are literally two blocks away from the Freedom Trail, down in the financial district on a safe Central business district road. Checking in took us some time. We got there on a Friday night. One elavator wasn't working. The card machine for rooms wasn't working well either. The two gentlemen working the front desk were very courtious and apologetic. They were doing the best anyone could do checking in hoards of guests, dealing with grumpy businessmen who could stand having to wait a minute or two for the one working elevator, manning the phones, conceirge requests, etc. They did this all in a very professional manner.The room was small and economical. You get two towels, one wash cloth, one hand towel, two pillows, a comfy bed, small TV, mini fridge, shower (no bath,) coffee machine and that's it. You'll not get anything extra here. So if you're OK with that (my fiance and I were) you'll be fine. If you''re higher maintenence, you'll hate this place.The only reason I rate the Club Quarters with an average score, rather than above average considering their location, was because of our check out experience. A wedding party was staying at the hotel that weekend as well. When we checked out one woman who was cold as ice was helping (or not helping) the Mother-of-the-Bride with reservations that had been messed up in their system. For 5-10 minutes this woman went from not being able to help the mother to fixing it once she figured out how. She had a chip on her shoulder, made everyone else in the lobby wait without any awknowledgement, including the Fedex service who had a package for the bride. In front of the mother of the bride, she tried to look the bride's name up in the system and asked the mother (still waiting for the one elevator) if she knew this guest. Yes, it was the bride. After spending that long helping the wedding party, how can she not know? Wouldn't any hotel have the wedding party's name at the front desk? If you're looking for a place to host an event, DO NOT do it here! This woman clearly did not care about service, karma, kindness, people, anything....cold as ice.So that's the impression I left with.

<Content>Stingy with normal supplies This hotel is indeed stingy. The Guest request closet was almost entirely empty- no pillows, no blankets, no irons- only a few coffee packets on the door. When I called down to the desk to request an additional pillow, they said they had run out of pillows. What kind of hotel runs out of pillows???That said, decor was nice, the beds comfortable, and location good.

<Content>Whatever you do, DO NOT stay at this hotel! I had read good and bad reviews about the service at this hotel before I made the reservation. I figured for the price i was paying, if the clerks were rude, that would not really matter to me because we would be sightseeing most of the time and would not be in the hotel anyway. I was wrong. I found out friendly and quality service is something that is very important to me. The clerks were very arrogant, rude, unhappy, and unhelpful. I made several requests and it fell on deaf ears. There were two people staying in our room. They had initially stocked the room with one towel and one washcloth. Repeated requests for more linens each day only brought one more towel and one more washcloth. They are very stingy with the linens. The restaurant near the lobby, Elephant and Castle, is very very bad. The servers were friendly enough, but the service was very very slow and the food was not very good. We would not stay there again, ever. However, the room/hotel was clean and it was in a very good location. Only three blocks from the subway and about six blocks from Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market. If you are looking for friendly clerks and quality service, this is NOT the hotel for you.

<Content>Great place to stay!! Excellent price $82.00, was supposed to be 1 double bed, turned out to be a KING size bed, that was extremely comfy with a down comforter and down pillows. Bathroom was great and the place was clean. Automated Check in/out worked fine and was fast and easy. Loved it, what a bargin.

<Content>Two Thumbs Up! This was our second stay this year at Club Quarters on Devonshire in Boston and again, everything was excellent. A nice room on the top floor with a roomy loveseat for TV viewing (much better angle than from the ever so comfortable bed!). The building is quiet, staff are friendly and very helpful. They let us check in 90 minutes early without a blink of an eye. Can't say enough about this hotel which offers very reasoanble rates on weekends and is central to everything!!

<Content>Had some problems I stayed w/2 friends at Club Quarters in Boston. The location is great and the rooms weren't too bad, but we had some problems. We got in Thur night and they did not have a room ready for us so they transferred us to Seaport which wouldn't have been a problem except that I had an important interview the next morning at 10am. B/c of the mix up and check out times at the other hotel I had to push my interview back to 2pm. Then when we arrived back at CQ they still didn't have a room for us so I had to get ready for my interview in the public restroom on the 2nd floor (no shower of course). They did pay for a cab to take us into Waltham which was nice, but it didn't really make up for the fact that we lost a whole day of activities due to the mix up. When we finally got back that night we got into our room only to find out that there was only one bed when we had made it very clear that we needed 2 beds. So, they brought us a cot that was more like a torture device than a bed. On the last night they finally got us into a room with 2 beds but we had to unpack and repack 3 times throughout our 3 day stay. When we checked out we asked to speak to a manager to see what they could do about our inconvenience and we were basically told that since we booked thru priceline there was nothing they could do for us. They were actaully kind of rude about it and the manager just stood there while another girl did all the talking. We got the feeling that it had more to do with us not being corporate clients than booking through priceline, but who knows. My conclusion is that this a is a fine hotel for business travelers but if you are going on vacation pay a little extra for a hotel with more amenities and better customer service.

<Content>We enjoyed our stay! When we read the other reviews on this web site we were wary! However, our stay was marvelous. We were allowed to check in early (1:15, rather than 3:00)and upgraded to an executive suite. This included a minifridge, microwave, desk, couch, and two televisions! (High-speed internet, too, I believe, but we did not use that)We liked that your room key card also operates the elevator. A nice extra sense of security.There is a nice club room to sit in with comfy sofas and a gas fire place. There is also a gym (we did not check it out, however.)Right next door is a great restaurant, The Elephant and Castle. it has a decent Sunday brunch buffet.Also, great central location, near all the Freedom Trail sights, Chinatown, and shopping.Staff was very nice, as well.

<Content>Great if you're only planning on sleeping there My boyfriend and I just returned from our weekend in Boston, where we stayed at the Club Quarters. We were booked a standard room through Travelocity (or one of the similar sites), which ended up being a room with a full size bed (they do give you any other option on any website). Before even getting up to our room, we asked if there was any way we could be moved to something with a queen size bed, as my boyfriend is very tall. Without hesitation, we were given keys to rm 317, which ended up being the executive suite. It sounds a whole lot jazzier than it really is. It was about the size of a regular hotel room, with a tiny kitchen area. We were certainly not going to complain. It was more than enough for us. We were only sleeping and getting ready in the room. We did have some problems Saturday night with the heat, as it was snowing like mad outside. They sent someone up to fix it. The bathroom was small, but it was clean, and the shower was hot and had good pressure. The Club Room was nice, as they had a computer with internet and a large TV. The pub next door was convenient, and had decent food. Note: late check out will cost you $30- $66. Leaving bags at the reception after check out costs $1 a bag, which I thought to be kind of crappy. All that being said, it was in a great location and we were warm and comfortable. We will definitely stay again.

<Content>Not so great We were shocked to find out that the hotel does not offer valet parking, nor does it have its own parking lot! We were sent to a parking lot approximately 2 blocks away and had to lug our large suitcases through the busy streets ourselves (parking cost $40 overnight). While the hotel was conveniently located, the room was so incredibly small and the staff was only mildly helpful. While we were struggling to get our luggage through the two main doors, the desk clerk literally climbed over us to get outside instead of helping us. Ridiculous! You really do get what you pay for, which is why this was the least expensive hotel in downtown Boston. We will definitely not stay at this hotel when we return.

<Content>Pretty good, nice staff After arriving hot off a long flight from the UK, we were disappointed to arrive at CQ to find they were full and could not honour our booking. However, the friendly and efficient staff had us in the Langham within 30 minutes of arriving (Which incidentally did not impress!).When we came back the next day we were upgraded to a better room than we had originally booked. The room was clean and cosy - which made us wonder how small our original room would have been!Despite these problems, the hotel is fine if compact. Great location for Quincy Market, and not too far from Boston Common and Beacon Hill.Overall, it was fine. Would I stay there again? Probably not, but I'm sitting typing this in the CharlesMark - which is rated No.3 out of 71 by the users of this site!

<Content>convenient but noisy My husband and I stayed last weekend for parent's weekend. The price of the room was reasonable, compared to many others. Prices that weekend can jump $100 per night. The staff is not particularly friendly, and the lobby is miniscule. Our first room was right in front of the elevator. We asked to be moved and were accomodated. Our next room was fine until our neighbors came back to their room at 3 am. I know that their rudeness is not the fault of the hotel, but the level of noise that seeps through the walls is. I was kept awake by the crys of our neighbor, who wanted to know (repeatedly) why her boyfriend didn't love her. I had a few suggestions for her (drunk and disorderly, whiney, needy).The hotel is within walking distance of Quincy Market, the Northend, and the Government Center, where we caught the T.

<Content>Never Again I booked the hotel through Priceline and let me tell you, if you are at all picky about your hotels, NEVER use Priceline.The first thing we noticed is that the room was EXTREMELY tiny. The end of the bed was probably three feet from the wall. About the bed...My wife is 5'5' and layed down on the bed with her head on the pillow and her feet were off the bed. We asked for a queen or king size bed and I think it was a double bed. I felt like I was in a room especially for little people.The room was also not very clean.The only positive is that it is near a lot.We cut our losses and left after 10 minutes. Priceline and Club Quarters would not help us with a refund. We went to the Hyatt Cambridge which was a GREAT hotel for the same price after using out AAA card. An expensive night, but well worth changing hotel.

<Content>Great Location ! My boyfriend and I stayed here the first weekend of October. I got a discount through the university I work for and payed $149 per night. I think this hotel is overpriced, but considering prices of other hotels thoughout Boston, in hindsight, I feel we got a (pretty good) deal. I searched and searched the internet, and this was the best deal I found for the location - which, by the way, is fantastic!! Our room was very tiny, though not a problem at all for us. It was clean, not bland, dingy, or outdated like some others have mentioned. Late at night, you can hear people in the halls and I heard the person in the room next store flushing the toilet. The food in the pub downstairs is so-so. That being said, I would stay in this hotel again. Like I said, the location was fabulous, the neighborhood clean and walkable with little traffic and the room was clean and pretty nice. The only reason I wouldn't stay is if I found a better priced hotel (that had a good rating).....Boston is a great town and I can't wait to go back !!

<Content>Nice hotel for the price Great location My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of the month. We did not get to the hotel until almost 1 in the morning. We went to the desk to check in and they told us we had to use the automatic machine instead. It did not like our credit card so we went back to the front desk, he was not happy to see us but did get us checked in. We then went up to our room and realized they had given us a double bed instead of the king. The first room was not very clean and you could hear the tv very loud from the room next door. We were given a new room with a king bed and the room was much better. There is not much space in the room but who goes to stay in the room the whole time? We were very happy with the new room. You are close to all 4 lines of the subway which was very easy to use. We were also just blocks from the market and shopping in all directions. The area the hotel was in was the financial district and since we were there on the weekend it was very quite. A great irish pub is located right outside the hotel. We had a great time and for the money the hotel did the job.

<Content>Get what you pay for...would stay again for the right price Great location. 4 minute walk to Faneuil Hall area. You aren't going to find many hotels that are 2 blocks from Faneuil Hall and under $100. I paid $90 per night for labor day weekend. I got what I paid for...but all of the travel website should reconsider the 3 star rating. Very outdated hotel...a bit of a dirty atmosphere(probably because of the style it is decorated in)...not unbearable. The front desk clerks were not very friendly. The rooms were a lot better than I expected for the price. They had a queen bed, a table with 2 chairs, a fridge, microwave, and sink. The bathroom was small but did the job. The linens were pretty gross. They definitely should bring some new towels into the rotation. They also only prepare the room for 1 person...this is probably because club quarters hotels are made for business travelers, who are typically alone. A call to the front desk will get you some extra towels. I would definitely stay again for $100 or under. I am shocked that this hotel usually goes for $160 per night(over priced) but all of the other hotels in the same area were quite a bit more. So if its a cheap room that you need...definitely do priceline.com and search the downtown/charlestown area...you might get lucky.

<Content>Would not stay there again Stayed just for one night in August. Found hotel to be unwelcoming, room bland and not prepared for 2 guests (one water glass, one tea bag, one half and half). Rang reception to ask for more and was brought just an extra glass. No refreshments of any sort available in hotel. Breakfast was in adjacent pub style bar, dingy and gloomy and had to be paid for separately.

<Content>The English Pub and the self cleaning room key. Clean smart Hotel in a very good location to see the sights of Boston. Staff were friendly if a little too eager to direct you to the auto check in/out machines. The room was clean and functional with everything you would want for a budget stay.Be careful with your room key as we and others found that if kept in your wallet they would loose the room info very easily requiring a trip to reception. The 'English Pub' next door was very pleasant but NOT English in the slightest (selling Newcastle Brown Ale doesnt count!), not witnessed many Irish Kareoke' nights before ! Well worth staying at!

<Content>Not a destination, but great base for sightseeing Here is the straight skinny on the CQ Boston --It is built for BUSINESS travelers, and as such, it is a wonderful place -- the rooms are small and clean. There is an attached pub (Elephant and Castle) where one can get a cold beer and some acceptable grub after a long day of meetings in the financial district if there is no desire to go exploring Boston. Wireless connectivity that is free, no strings attached all over the hotel.A family on vacation here would be quite miserable in one room, they are far too small. A young couple intent on exploring the city and using the hotel as a base of operations rather than as a destination would be quite happy here. As far as location goes, you are less than 5 minutes from Fanueil Hall and the bevy of tourist traps there (Durgin Park seafood being the noteworthy exception), the North End and the wonderful Italian Pastry shops are just 10 minutes walk, and the Blue Line is less than 2 blocks away.Overall, a destination hotel this is NOT. As a clean, comfortable base for adventuresome duos this is perfect.One negative -- the elevator is a disaster...small, slow, and one was out of service

<Content>bad attitude by the staff I am very disappointed in the service in the Boston Clubquarters on 7/1/05.I had booked 2 rooms through Hotels for 7/1. When I arrived, I found that only 1 room had been reserved for me. The desk agent was not very helpful over the next 3 hours in resolving the situation. Finally, I called Hotels customer service, got the agent to talk to your desk clerk, found that it was clubquarters error and got the second room. It took about 4 hours to get a rollaway bed in one room and only 1 of 2 elevators were working, making for long waits for an elevator. Overall, an unpleasant experience. The staff was not welcoming or helpful with my problems. I won't stay here again and don't recommend it.

<Content>Very Quaint Boutique Hotel My husband and I were in Boston for a college graduation - although we spent most of our time on campus, we very much enjoyed the time we spent at Club Quarters - the room is cozy (small) but tastefully decorated and very clean. We found the room to be quiet, the bed comfortable and room temperature very adjustable. We used the fitness center which was also clean, well-furnished and private. Staff was friendly and helpful. We would definitely book here again.

<Content>Great price, great location I would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel. This hotel is conveniently located between State Stree and Downtown Crossing T stops - both about 2-3 blocks away. (The airport was only about 3 T stops away). The hotel is only a few blocks from Boston Commons, the Freedom Trail and Quincy Market. We had 2 people in their smallest room (one double bed) but we had more than enough space for our 3 nights. Rooms were clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size. We checked in and checked out using the kiosks right inside the door. Not reason enough to decide to stay there - but it was very fast and very nice. The hotel has a nice fitness center that was empty both days we used it. My boyfriend thanked me / complimented me all weekend for choosing such a great hotel, with a great price and great location! Next time I go to Boston, I will stay here again.Actually, I normally use this site for recommendations but got such a good deal and planned the trip last minute that I didn't even check the other reviews. I was very surprised to ready some negative reviews today. I have only nice things to say about the Club Quarters. I stayed at one in Chicago a couple of years ago and found it to be equally as nice.

<Content>Perfect spot in Boston! While the rooms are fairly small, they have every amenity. Coffee maker and coffee/cups/creamers, micro, fridge, small dresser, two night tables, desk  desk chair, queen-size bed, livingroom chair and closet. What else do you need? All this, plus the added security of each person having to use their room card to enter the floor from the elevator. Front desk was always staffed and ready to help. A room off the lobby called the Club Room which had a couple of computers to use - no charge. This hotel is located in the financial district, 2 short blocks from Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market and a half block from the T.  Someone on this website mentioned no extra pillows, iron, etc. Well, if they had read the literature left in the room (on the bed, night stand and desk), they would have seen that on each floor, next to the room ending in 02 there is a guest closet clearly marked, for extra coffee, iron, ironing board, pillows, blanket, etc.  The only drawback to us was that my husband and I are used to a King bed, and the rooms only have one Queen. Some rooms have two twins, but none were available at the time. So, we just snuggled a little closer, that's all. All in all...we'd go back. We only stayed one night, and were so close to everything we could possibly want, including Washington Street where all the shopping is! They even took 20% off our parking!

<Content>Terrible Hotel I stayed at Club Quarters after it accepted my bid on Priceline.com, and I have NEVER used Priceline again, after being stuck with a hotel like this. First of all, the staff is terribly rude. At one point, the housekeeper literally banged on my door and demanded to be let into my room, even though I was in the middle of getting dressed. It turned out that the room service person had heard my television in the room, and thought I had snuck another person into my single room!!! When I called down to complain to the manager, she basically told me that it was a privately owned hotel, and they had a right to be let in to clean the room. I do not throw these kind of accusations around lightly, and I have never said this about another hotel, but I really believe that prejudice was a factor here. I am not accusing the hotel ownership, but the staff on duty. I do not wish to elaborate anymore, but I was so upset by this that I demanded they call Priceline, which made an exception and returned my money so I could find a different hotel. I ended up staying at the Omni Parker House, which is a delightful hotel and the friendly staff there helped rescue my trip from a disastrous start.

<Content>Bad Experience, Helpfull Staff I stayed as a Priceline deal, some of the bad experience is pricelines fault. Priceline said within easy walking distance to the Fleet Center, definately not true on a 10 degree Feb. night. The first room was near the roof top under a very loud roof heater unit, and there was a lot of construction noise. The staff was very friendly and helpful. No problem with locating us to a quieter room. It was an OK experience, but not a 3.5 star rating. 2 star. Very difficult to drive to , and parking was a block away. If you're going to the Fleet Center for an event, try the Holidan Inn Select Government Center. It is pricy, but have never had a bad stay. 15 minute walk to Fleet Center and North Station. 1/2 hour walk to Fanual Hall.

<Content>Great Hotel Within minutes of landing at Logan International Airport, we were in a cab and headed to the Club Quarters Hotel, located in downtown Boston. Our room was quaint and comfortable, and only a short walk to the marketplace and the harbor. The Freedom Trail was nearby and a great way to see many historical sites. We took the subway( only a few blocks from the hotel) to see the Kennedy Library. The trolleys made for a great way to ride around the city and see many interesting places. There is a great restaurant adjacent to the hotel. We would stay at the Club Quarters Hotel during any future visits to the city.

<Content>Fabulous! When we landed at the airport we went on a bus to the underground station, went two stops down the line and got off right in the middle of Boston. We could see our hotel from there!The street was a little like a back street so I was a bit aprehensive at first, the hotel was lovely and clean when we went in. All secure by room key which makes you feel very safe. Rooms were very good size and for a refreshing change so was the bathroom.Attached to the hotel was a lovely English pub, quite expensive but still nice.When you want to explore you are right in the thick of it and can walk everywhere which means you save taxi/tube money!The hotel is only a couple of blocks from the Quincy Market - my favourite place!!We will DEFINATLEY use this hotel again, no faults whatsoever!

<Content>Reasonable Hotel I was bit nervous about booking this hotel since the picture seems to be of a bar. However for the price this is an extremely good deal. The rooms are small but clean. The hotel is pretty much a self service environment, if your expecting the Ritz Carlton this is the wrong place for you, if you want a good room and a good price in a great location this hotel is the deal. The accomadation includes free Internet access in the rooms. One thing that is missing is an IRON. Stayed Dec 2005.

<Content>Club Quarters Hotel, not a place to go Club Quarters Boston appears to be a nice Hotel when you look at the pictures through Hotels.In reality they try to stuck you in a room where a dog would become claustrofobic. Not that big of a problem if they would just nicely cancel your stay, like we asked when we went out looking for a new hotel (which we found easily). After leaving the luggage in the room for 1 1/2 hours they decided to tell Hotels that they would charge a whole night after all, while the frontdesk lady of that time assured us that there was no problem. I call that a big scam and a ugly spot on the beautiful image of Boston, which is one of the greatest cities I have ever seen!

<Content>Great location, OK Hotel, did I mention great location This hotel could not be located in a better part of town for a tourist, and has all the amenities needed for a business traveler.The hotel itself was just OK, the room sizes are about average for a downtown hotel and they could have been a bit cleaner, but overall...OK.The hotel had wireless high speed internet  a mini fridge. Connected to the lobby was an Elephant  Castle Pub (looks original but it鈥檚 a chain) which is nice for a Pint or 2 before going out.

<Content>A good hotel Like some previous reviewers I was a little worried about staying at Club Quarters. However, I found it to be a delightful hotel right in the middle of the city and well placed for sight seeing. If you want to spend a lot of time in your room then maybe this is not the hotel for you.I found the staff to be helpful and the free internet access in the Club Room was a good touch.

<Content>Loved it Like a lot of folks, I never heard of Club Quarters until I was assigned there when they accepted my Priceline bid. After reading the reviews here, I was almost convinced to try cancelling. I'm glad I didn't.The room was good sized, stylishly appointed, complete with microwave and refrigerator. It was spotless and the bathroom, while not large, was very well outfitted with a first-class shower head (no tub, but a tiled shower.) The bed was fine, the TV fine. It had a cordless telephone plus a regular one at the desk.The building is secured by your electronic key and you help yourself to whatever you need from the supply closet (extra blankets and pillows, iron, etc.) I found the staff to be very hospitable and efficient, and the club room is cool - fireplace, seating areas, three broadband-connected PCs free for guest. They also have wi-fi and Ethernet ports in the rooms, all free.You can't beat the location, maybe 2-3 blocks from Fanueil Hall, a block or so from the State Street T station, just around the corner from the theaters, Filene's, the Commons, etc. The English pub next door has good beer and food. It's in the financial district, so it gets pretty quiet on the weekend (maybe not reassuring from a safety perspective at night, but we had no problems.)My wife and I loved our weekend at Club Quarters. Outstanding location, very nice room, helpful staff. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>No Problem Here After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, we expected the worst! Yes, most of the staff could use a little attitude adjustment (actually they just need to find a personality), but the hotel itself was just fine. You can't beat the location and the price. For a weekend in which we had no intention of spending time in the room, it was perfect. The room was clean, small, but large enough for two people to be comfortable in. We expected a fullsize bed and it wound up being a queensize which was a plus. Check in was at 3:00 p.m. We arrived at 11:00 a.m. and a room was ready. Automated check out was a breeze. We would definitely return to the Club Quarters for its location and value. I really don't understand some of the reviews I've read.

<Content>Good stay  Spent one night here on August 21, 2004. We had 3 rooms booked. Since we had booked on Priceline we were only guaranteed sleeping for 2 people each room. We had 7 people. Asked at check-in if they had rollaways available and they did. Cost $13.00 for the extra person in the room. Clerk at check-in was quick and friendly. Rooms were clean with one queen bed, desk  chair and one of our rooms even had a small couch. Rooms are a little on the small side but since they mostly cater to business travelers this seems adequate. Location to Quincy Market is fantastic. No more than a 5 minute walk. Next door is the Elephant  Castle Pub which was good. Overall I would definitely stay at Club Quarters again for it's clean rooms and great location. Especially for the great price I paid.

<Content>We were happy with it!!! While the Club Quarters was not as posh as the other hotels in the area the room was clean,neat and comfortable.You won't find an ice bucket or iron in the room as these items will be found at the ice machine and a guest closet down the hall. We enjoyed our stay and at the price we will return again. There was some noise in the hall....not loud so no big deal. The Staff could smile a bit more at the desk but they were helpfull.Again for the price we can visit Boston more often.......

<Content>did we stay at the same hotel????? My stay was excellent; wonderful location, room was very nice (could accomodate 2 comfortably), wireless internet access was great, the staff were friendly and helpful. Reading some of the reviews, I can't believe we are talking about the same hotel! I accumulate over 75,000 skymiles a year so I travel extensively. I've paid a lot more and received a whole lot less. I'll conclude by saying, some people are never satisfied with anything...

<Content>Only thing missing was a bullhorn My boyfriend and I stayed here one night and it will be the last. The staff was barely friendly and made no offer to help with our luggage. Once upstairs we noticed that the room was small but clean, which was okay because we weren't expecting much. That night when we went to bed we could hear everything that was going on in the hall and in our neighbor's room! There were people standing outside our door listening to the details of our relationship - all we needed were cameras to broadcast our evening activities! In the morning we RAN to our reserved rooms at the Ritz-Carlton Boston Common - it was as if we were being rescued!
