<Content>Location, location, location Fabulous location. Walk everywhere. Quiet even though we faced Las Ramblas. Staff was good, no issues except with the chronic complainers on this site. Walk out the door and you are in the middle of things, 15 minutes to the sea, 2 minutes to the metro. We had a super time without breaking the bank for a hotel room. Really nice place at a good price compared to others. Our friends were totally happy with their room as well. I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Disappointed Room was OK plenty of space but why oh why dont continental hotels not have tea/coffee making facilities? Breakfast had to be taken in the restaurant next door. Staff were not overly friendly r helpful. Location is good for La Rambla, but is more of a 2/3 star hotel in UK. Expect more from a 4 star rating.

<Content>Great Location Stayed here two nights in December. Great hotel and the location is superb. Found the staff helpful and the late checkout for an extra 鈧?0 is good value. Room was nice anc clean. Would recommend to anyone looking for a convenient base in Barcelona.

<Content>Where did the 4 stars come from? In a nutshell, clean and acceptable hotel, great location. No idea how they got their 4 stars, they have a lift, but no swimming pool, no sauna/steam room, the rooms are small, no tea or coffee facilities.Unfortunately, I booked this hotel with HOTELCLUB and they booked me a double room even though I stated that I had a 9 year old child. Anyway, I had to pay another 50 euros and HOTELCLUB doesn't want to know. If I knew about the additional charge, I think I would be rented an apartment instead since you would have more room and you can buy glorious fresh produce from the market and not pay for city priced meals at or around the hotel.

<Content>Ramblas Royalty The only bad thing about our stay at the Royal Ramblas was that we only had one night there. It's a very nice hotel right in the heart of Las Ramblas, yet it's quiet as can be even though our room overlooked the Ramblas.Check-in was easy and we had help with our bags. The room was better than expected with a nice, large bed, a beautiful bathroom and a nice overlook of the action on Las Ramblas.Breakfast was plentiful (for 10 euros each) in the attached restaurant, where we also had a decent evening meal. Checkout was easy and they called a cab for us.All in all, a very nice stay. Again, wish we could have stayed longer.

<Content>Royal Feel We Stayed 2 nights (2 adults and 12 and 9 year old girls) at the Royal Ramblas and the whole experience from beginning to end was fantastic. We booked a designer family room on the Royal Floor (Room 10). As soon as we walked into the room it was clean and tidy. Nothing was out of place. The kids had their own TV with disney channels and we had our own. The beds were very comfortable. There was a minibar. Lots of storage space. Complementary safe and the bathroom was absolutely gorgeous!!!. The hydrobath was very welcoming after a hard day sightseeing. We checked in without any problems. There was always a cleaner on the Royal Floor who would smile and greet you as well. There was also a lounge area with books, magazines and tea/coffee making familities and mineral water which we thought was a nice touch. The staff were courteous and always greeted you with a smile. Nothing was too much for them. We didn't have breakfast included in our price but one morning when we wanted some tea and couldn't get into the lounge area on the Royal Floor as it was booked for a meeting, they told us to get it from the dining room. The breakfast looked very plentiful and fresh so it might be a bit pricey but there seemed to be a lot of choice. The staff in the restaurant were also very friendly and helpful. We would definately recommend this hotel and would definately stay here again.As far as location goes you can't get any better. You are right on La Ramblas which is always buzzing. Within 10 minutes walk you can get to the port. You must go and see the magic fountain (free). Be aware of pick pockets. Read the reviews and the scams around. Keep valuables out of sight!!! Enjoy your stay

<Content>Can't Beat the Location We stayed here for several nights and thoroughly enjoyed the place. It is in an ideal location for visiting most of Barcelona's centrally-located tourist destinations (the beach is a bit of a hike, FYI). It is located located directly on Las Ramblas, which is the main pedestrian thoroughfare in the city. It is also about a one-minute walk to Plaza Catalunya, the heart of the city. The gothic neighborhood is less than five minutes away. The subway can be accessed from a very short walk away. Inside the hotel, we thought the lobby was very pleasant and the staff very friendly and accomodating. Due to missing a flight, we stayed in two different rooms during our stay; each was clean and well-maintained. We also found the prices to be very reasonable for the location and quality of the hotel.

<Content>Perfect Hotel The location of this hotel is perfect, very close to Placa Catalunya, and right on La Rambla. Getting around is done on foot, with no problems. Taxis are also readily close. If shopping, eating, drinking, nightlife, beautiful days, easygoing people, easygoing sightseeing into culture are your ideas of a great trip, the Barcelona is your destination, and the Hotel Royal is your home. Cross La Rambla and you are on headed to Barrio Gotica, Walk behind the hotel and you are outside the University. Turn to the right and you will find the Boqueria, continue down and you will be at the port. The hotel staff is impeccably professional, accommodating, and quite polite. They helped with arranging for car rental, early morning taxi to the airport, pretty much anything we needed extra assistance with.The hotel is also very clean and modern, very comfortable. It is right on La Rambla, which never sleeps. However, the windows are double-paned, and can be opened in sections. So the noise does not bother. In fact, we opened both, and still slept soundly.  I recommend this hotel to anyone ready to visit.

<Content>Lovely hotel but dodgy area Nice hotel, helpful staff, clean rooms.Was pickpocketed right outside the hotel by organised gang. Police not interested, they just watch! Take care on the Rambla, if someone approaches you be ready to defend yourself, it's the only way you'll keep your money.

<Content>Loved the Royal Ramblas! Our Barcelona stay at the Royal Ramblas was excellent! Our room overlooked the Ramblas and was very quiet...if you opened both sets of windows only then could you hear street activities. The room was warm and very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is great, easy walking access to sites, as well as bus, metro and cabs available. Even with a very wet and dreary day we were able to appreciate the view from our windows.Next time, definitely a longer stay in Barcelona and another visit to the Royal Ramblas.The Burkes

<Content>The Best Location in Barcelona. The Hotel is average. The Staff is rude. Royal Ramblas has the best location in Barcelona. On The Ramblas, close to the plaza Catalunia and La Boqueria.The hotel is average. Small rooms, clean but with a terrible shower. They gave me a back view room.The Wi-fi acess was not free, was very expensive. But the worst thing in the hotel was the rude Staff.When I arrived, My safe box was out of order. After 3 phone calls, nothing happened. I tried to fix it during my 3 days stay, without any success.There was a construction (and noise too) just beside my room (a neighbor building). The same happened... I called the front desk several times, and even with the promisse of a room change, nothing hapened.The worst of all: The whole hotel became out of lights at midnight. On the next day, when i spoke to the manager about all that mess, he only said: That is not my problem. It is the Light concessionary problem... What a shame...One the day before my departure, the front desk forgot to wake me up... If it happened one day later, I could lost my plane...I am giving a 4 star quotation for the Hotel, just because of the location (is absolutely the best). Otherwise, it would be a 2 star rate.

<Content>Great place to stay the hotel is right on the Las Ramblas where the pedestrian traffic flows day and night.The hotel was very clean, fairly modern. The hotel staff were very friendly, outgoing and very helpful in answering any questions or meeting your needs.booking on the internet saved us money as well.I would not hesitate to stay here again on future visits.The hotel is near the subways system, bus system and numerous restaurants. The fruit market is a couple of blocks down the street and a very modern grocery store is located 4 doors down. Overall the hotel was a great place to stay. We had a room off the main street which was fine with us. The windows are double up so you donot hear any of the noise or music coming from the main street.

<Content>Small room but clean, modern, good quality I stayed here overnight before a business meeting the next day. I wanted somewhere in an area that I could walk around in the hour or so I had free in the city that evening. The location of the Royal Ramblas was great for that - I was able to walk down La Rambla and then into the Barri G贸tic.Room was small, and bathroom was tiny, but was clean and quiet, and decoration and fittings were modern and of good quality.Getting here from Sants station took about 25 minutes in a taxi and cost about 鈧?2. My meeting next day was in El Pol铆gono De La Pedrosa, which also took about 25 mins in a taxi for the same price.

<Content>Right on Las Ramblas! I stayed here two nights post cruise with my son and daughter. We had requested a triple room, which ended up being two twin beds and a roll away bed. Our room overlooked Las Ramblas, even though we did not book a superior room.I give this hotel a above average rating, due to it's ideal location right on Las Ramblas, 1/2 a block from Pla莽a de Catalunya. Pla莽a de Catalunya, a large square, is were you purchase tickets for Bus Turistic and has a subway stop.The room itself was clean, and modern.Bathroom was large and included a shower/tub and bidet.The room also had an in room safe and mini bar.I would recommend this hotel for it's excellent location.

<Content>Comfortable Hotel in Prime Location This hotel in right on the La Rambla and close to everything you need. You can walk to all the major attractions from this hotel (which is the most important thing for me).The hotel is close to the airport and only cost us about 15 euros.They have a 24 hour front dest who are always ready to help with enquiries. The rooms are very clean and include a large bathroom.The only complaint I had was that you needed to put all the towels in the bathtub before they changed them and also they didnt have many power points (which is a problem with 3 girls all wanting to do their hair before going out!)But overall we were very happy with this hotel and would definately stay there again.

<Content>A Little Dated Would not class this hotel as a 4*, but did however stay in an older style room at the back of the hotel. Tea making facilities in the room would be avantageous considering hot drinks machine out of order during our weeks stay.Minibar a plus but expensive( supermarket a few metres away, far cheaper!) On the plus side room quiet, but could be very dull and dark, due to limited natural light. Room service very good, clean sheets and towels whenever needed. Shower awful if you have long hair to wash.Lobby area not up to standards of a 4* hotel- no bar. Buffet breakfast excellent and so too were both restaurants. Staff professional at all times.Would benefit from a make-over,but overall enjoyable stay.

<Content>Excellent location, excellent service. We chose the Royal for our honeymoon and couldn't have been happier about it. The location put us within easy walking distance of the major museums and buildings we wanted to see, and it was an easy stroll out to the Barri Gotic or the Passeig de Gracia for dinner. Service was excellent, and the staff went above and beyond to help make our stay more comfortable.

<Content>Fab location yet still quiet indoors Stayed with my partner for 3 nights at the Royal Ramblas Hotel in Barcelona. The hotel was easy to find and one of the best locations. Room was large and bright and thankfully the aircon worked as it was very hot outside. No noise at all from the street. One small niggle was the low water pressure in the shower but overall, a great hotel which allowed us a late checkout for a small surcharge. We did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food.

<Content>Great Location. My partner and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The hotel is in a great location but that is probably all I liked. On arrival we were allocated a room that absolutely reeked of smoke even though we'd requested non-smoking. I was 4 months pregnant at the time and the smell made me want to be sick. We complained and they eventually agreed to move us to another room. The room didn't smell of smoke, was more spacious so we were really pleased! Until it got to 4am the next morning and we could hear two guys in the room next to us using the toilet, talking etc etc! It was awful! Perhaps we were just unlucky and got the rubbish rooms but I would not stay here again!

<Content>Great location This hotel was very clean and very quiet (rather important on La Rambla). We up graded to a superior room with a view over La Rambla and the double glazing worked a treat and as a lot of the previous reviews stated, we slept very well despite being just above all the street life of La Rambla.Don't bother with the 10 Euro breakfast buffet at the ajoining restaurant, it wasn't really worth the money and the eggs tasted very weird.Only problem we had on our last day/night was drilling and banging from 8am to 8pm, despite calls to reception at 7pm requesting that they sort it out as we had come back from a long day sightseeing and wanted to catch a nap so we could see some of Bacelona's night life,but nothing was done to stop it.

<Content>Great location and views of Ramblas Had one of the upgraded rooms, very nice/modern. Looked out on the Ramblas. No noise from street as promised, yet you can open the windows if so desired. Definitely right where the action is. Don't miss the open Market just down the street, same side towards the ocean. Staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant also very good. Restaurant is on Rick Steve's list.

<Content>Beware! Building work taking place at this hotel My visiit to this hotel took place in Mid June. We had booked a double superior room and were given a very small, dark and gloomy twin room with very small single beds(the lights had to be on all the time) Room 101 (!!!) overlooking Las Ramblas. We were checked in late at night after a long journey by an efficient but unfriendly member of staff. We didnt complain about the room that evening as it was late and we just wanted to go to bed. The next morning we were woken up with the sound of banging from above our beds. After a long, hot day in Barcelona we returned to our room to have a rest before heading off for a special meal for my birthday. No sooner had we put our feet up and the drilling and banging started and this went on for several hours. When we could stand it no more we left the hotel (at 7.35 pm) despite our restaurant booking not being until 9pm. I had been down to reception to request that we change rooms (to a double room as booked and to a quieter location) and to ask about the noise. I was told by a very rude male receptionist ( he answered the telephone interrupting our conversation and didnt bother to apologise after he continued speaking to someone else for several minutes )that I should ask in the morning as there was nothing he could do that evening and that the noise was due to the third floor being renovated and some problems with the water pressure and the drilling, banging etc did not start until 10 am each day and finished by 6.30 pm. Both of these facts were untrue. It is clearly unacceptable to still be making this amount of noise during the evening when guests are returning to the hotel and have paid a lot of money to stay in this location, in what is after all meant to be a 4 star hotel with a price tag to match. This receptionist then merely shrugged his shoulders at me when I told him that we were not informed that building work was taking place at the hotel when we had booked only a week before as we would not have considered paying this amount of money to have this noise the whole time you were in the room. I was really upset by his attitude and went back to the room very angry and tearful .Even something small such as the offer of complimentary breakfasts to make up for the noise would have gone a long way to making up for the inconvenience and upset that we had encountered.I would not stay at this hotel again or recommend it to others despite its fantastic location because customer service is clearly not a proirity here.

<Content>Fabulous Royal Ramblas Our stay at the Royal Ramblas Hotel was a very pleasant experience. We had a front room which was fantastic. Did not hear any noise due to the great soundproof windows. The hotel was also very clean, staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast was fantastic. The location was superb - right on the ramblas. Would really recommend this hotel and it is worth the little bit extra for a front room. You need not look any further!!!There were no negative points and I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Hotel - Superb Location We recently spent two nights at this hotel and can thoroughly recommend it. The rooms were very clean and well appointed and the situation was ideal for exploring being at the top of Las Rambla near Catalonia Square. It was such a pleasure to be able to step out of the front entrance and see La Rambla early in the morning without the tide of people and to have a safe have to dip in and out of when we wanted it.

<Content>The Perfect Location in Barcelona We took a cruise this month in the Mediterranean which left from and returned to Barcelona. In searching for hotels online, I found the Royal Ramblas. It sounded good from the description; the reality was even better. First, it's right on las Ramblas, the street that extends up from the harbor and is host to hotels, cafes, restaurants, flower and pet sellers, and strollers at almost all times of the day and night. Second, the room was modern and very clean with a comfortable bed and excellent room service. Third, it's about a block or so from the Placa de Catalunya and the bus turistica that takes you all over the city, as well as a major department store, several great cafes for breakfast, tapas restaurants, and some Gaudi buildings, an ideal location. If you can, get a room that overlooks las Ramblas. The people at the desk were very helpful and friendly. All in all, a great experience...and we can't wait to go back to Barcelona!

<Content>Great location and good value Stayed in a 'Royal' Twin Room. Very comfortable with wonderful views of The Rambla. Access to lounge with tea-making facilities. Good buffet breakfast. My husband left his radio in the room and this was forwarded on to us the very next day for the cost of the postage. All-in-all a wonderful three-day break in an hotel in a wonderful location.

<Content>incredible hotel great location My stay at this hotel was just incredible. The room was bigger than I expected and very clean and well kept, and so was the bathroom. The staff was very helpful and courteous, the housekeepers always did an great job, and you just can't beat the hotel's location right on the ramblas. I had no need for taxis or the metro as everything is within walking distance from the hotel. I am definately going to stay there again next year.

<Content>Good but not 4 star I have just returned form the Hotel Royal after a trip with my mum. I stayed here 3 years ago with my husband and son and was dissapointed that our room was not over looking the Ramblas, as it was last time. The room was small, overlooking a wall, it was v dark and you could only see what the weather was doing outside by opening the window and literally sticking your head out!! There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which should really be standard in a 4 Star hotel. The shower was not very powerful, however the bathroom was spotless as was the bedroom. The room was nice and quiet at night for sleeping. Staff were very pleasant. The best thing about the hotel is the location. We didnt use the resaturant for breakfast - we used the cafe across the street (Moko) which was 鈧?.80 for coffee and toast, lovely sitting outside eating breakfast watching all the traders getting set up the day. Hotel is also brilliantly placed to get the airport bus, it stops at Placa Catalyuna (beside El Cortes Ingles), it only costs 鈧?.10 one way and was v quick - 20 minutes and goes every 20 minutes. All in all its a good hotel but definately not a 4 Star by UK / USA standards, however if its only a clean, safe, quiet hotel in a great location then its ideal.

<Content>Loved the Royal Ramblas We found the Royal hotel very comfortable with a lovely room, friendly and helpful staff and so centrally situated. We particularly appreciated the salon de tea on our floor and the restaurant which we used for breakfast, and sometimes for lunch and dinner. When we visit Barcelona again, we will certainly stay at the Royal.

<Content>Lovely boutique hotel - great value and service We arrived early morning from a lovely cruise. We were surprised that our room was ready at no extra charge. The person at the desk helped us with our very bulky luggage. The breakfast (not included but a value at 9 euro), was superb except for the literally raw American style bacon. The room was quiet with not just a double paned window protecting from the noise of the Ramblas, but two separate windows on either side of the casing.The room itself was not 4 star by US standards - it was small with a view of an adjoining rooftop. But the location - literally ON the Ramblas, with none of the noise, and the friendly, kind, family-style service, was 5 star-5 diamond. We paid 145 Euro, in mid May, which we thought was a good value. Highly recommend!

<Content>The Best Location!....but.....No definitive lounge/bar area. My partner  I, together with our 13 year old daughter, stayed at The Royal Ramblas for 4 days in April 2008.We had a family room of three single beds. Great room with lots of space, storage  spotlessly clean.Unfortunately we were in a room at the back of the hotel which didn't overlook The Ramblas so our view (literally) was a brick wall. We decided not to upgrade to a 'Rambla' view as we were out  about all day anyway. An upgrade would be worth considering if you intend to spend longer periods of time in your room however.We were in Barcelona at the time of the Manchester United semi final Champions League match against Barcelona. My partner  daughter were very disappointed that the hotel did not prescribe to the tv channel broardcasting this match - something to think about if you're a footy fan  want to watch a local match on tv in your hotel room.Our only negative comment about this hotel is that there are no designated, private  comfortable lounge, bar  restaurant areas. These are through a sliding door to the restaurant  bar next door - 'La Poma'. The food here is very good but expensive - it is also open to the general public  this distracted from the cosy intimate atmosphere of the quintessential lounge/bar we expect of a 4 star hotel. Overall, a good hotel but we have have stayed in better 4 star hotels. Probably wouldn't stay here again but only because of the lounge/bar/restaurant arrangements.

<Content>Great Hotel... Stayed here for a couple of nights on the way back from Ibiza. Great room, we had a 'Designo' double as there were no suites availble, but the r0om was excellent, as were the desk staff. No bar as such in the hotel but it's right on the Ramblas so this isn't really an issue. Only (very slight) blight on the two nights was the grumpy little fellow who brought our wine to the room!

<Content>A Fantastic Hotel in a Wonderful City We stayed for four nights at the Royal Ramblas Hotel and found it to be everything proclaimed on their website.Staff were helpful and friendly. The location was excellent. Having booked a room overlooking the Ramblas, we were not disappointed. The hustle and bustle during the day was fabulous. The atmosphere until late in the night was unbelieveable.Breakfast was very good value and had a superb choice of food.We would have no hestitation in recommending this hotel to anyone travelling to Barcelona. And we would most definately stay at the hotel if we were to return to the city.

<Content>Las Ramblas Great Location This hotel was in a perfect location to experience Las Ramblas. It was in the center of all the good hotels and restaurants. It was close to museums and historical churches. The hotel staff was friendly and spoke English. The room was a little small and the beds were small too. I think that is just the way they are in Spain. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>great Location After i had booked Royal Ramblas was a bit worried, because it had two bad reviews in February . I need not have worried, yes one of the guys on receiption was not pleasant, but so what, he was the only one. The hotel is ideally situated at top of Ramblas, great for arriving late at night when your not sure where to go. Breakfast was great! it was included in our package, room we had was spacious although it was situated at back of hotel, but i had requested a quiet room and thats what we got. Would stay here again, hotel is spotless.

<Content>Perfect Location The location of the hotel is perfect for visitors to Barcelona. Right on the Las Ramblas - the heart of the city allows travelers to come and go during the day to rest and freshen up before heading out on another adventure. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to all those who enjoy comfort and convenience.

<Content>Certainly not a 4* Hotel Booked this hotel for 4 nights - special treat for my husband's 50th birthday. Thought I would go the extra for somewhere special as the occasion was special. What a mistake!!Reception area was minimal, bedrooms were very small to say the least. Yes there was a lovely big bed there - 4* bed - that was all. I was so disappointed. Complained at reception - he said I had the 'superior room' - God help the ones booked into the normal rooms!! Overall, it was a 2* Hotel and definetly not anywhere near a 4*. The location was perfect, and to be fair, the hotel refunded me the next 3 days, as there was no way I was staying there any longer.Ideal hotel for young couples - that's it  much too expensive also for the poor quality.

<Content>Royal Hotel - Las Ramblas This hotel has a great location if you want to do the whole tourist thing around the Ramblas. It's located right on the Ramblas near the Placa de Catalunya and within easy walking distance of the Born area and such like.The cost is about what you'd expect to pay for the location.I stayed in one of the small double rooms. It was fine as you don't really go to Barcelona to stay in a hotel room.The rooms have most of the standard facilities and are clean and comfortable.I've stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions on business trips as well and the staff are friendly and helpful.

<Content>Awful! The hotel is supposed to be four star - not in my world it wasn't! The staff were surly on the desk and the rooms were dismal. The bed had a plastic undersheet that russled every time you moved and made you feel like you were staying in a care home for the elderly.My room was too hot the air con wasn't switched on and on opening the window for air the room stank of frying bacon from the kitchen I suppose. I complained but was told there was absolutely nothing that could be done. I got no sleep as the next door room were obviously rekindling their love life and the sound proofing was non existent. I had the pleasure of visiting the hotel's restaurant - though restaurant is not what I'd call it. The staff were even more repugnant and the pizza I had was unbelievably bad. This whole experience cost 250 euros for two nights - my advice is don't ever ever ever stay at this hotel it was a revolting experience.

<Content>A Perfect Stay We just returned from a five night stay at the Royal. We are frequent travelers and a bit fussy, but I booked this hotel based solely on the reviews on Trip Advisor and hoped that the reviews were accurate. We could not have been more pleased. We booked a Designer Room on the Royal floor (2nd floor) with a perfect view of the Ramblas. There were double proofed windows so there was absolutely no noise from the street. The location could not have been more perfect, and the staff was extremely helpful when approached with a question. The hotel was immaculate and the shower was amazing! If you are on the Royal floor, you get the benefit of free wireless, which worked for us because we brought our laptop. There was nothing that we felt the hotel was lacking in. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning and although I felt that it was a bit on the expensive side, it had quite an extensive selection of well-prepared food. I can't say the same for the dinner that we had in the hotel one evening. It was really quite mediocre. Try The Attic for dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed it, as we did the tapas at a restaurant called Tramoia which was a short walk away. Both are a little bit pricey but well worth it. We love Barcelona and the Royal!

<Content>Great base for a short stay Chose this hotel blind from about 40 on the web. What a great choice, small friendly hotel, directly on Las Ramblas; central for everything; near to the buses, shopping, markets  shore. We booked B  B - the breakfast was great, just what you need for a day's site seeing.They have a restaurant attached which is good value, plus there are numerous restaurant of varying prices in the surrounding areas.Ask for a room at the back - so quiet! - those overlooking Las ramblas may have the view - but also have the noise until very late at night. The room was fine, comfortable bed, en suite with all the expected soaps, shampoos etc. We would stay there again

<Content>Pleasant Experience I had a most pleasant experience while staying at the Royal Hotel. Check-in was Nov 30th and they had a room available for my early arrival. The front desk staff , as well as the bellman were friendly and spoke English.The room itself, tho a bit narrow, was clean, providing twin beds, a table with 2 chairs, ample closet and shelf space, a safe, and a refrigerator. The frig was filled with various drinks and snacks. The only problem was if you wished to purchase your own water and store it inside, they would remove it. Did not like that. A televison was also available but I did not turn it on so can't comment on what was available for viewing.The bathroom was large enough with a nice tub/shower, good water pressure with plenty of hot water, nice sink area with room for personal items, and a hair dryer.Computer access was wireless and easy to use. You could buy minutes or get the daily plan, which was the most cost efficient. Naturally you would need a converter if you are from the states.The hotel was definately convenient to Los Ramblas, which was right out the door. Tho my room faced that street, the noise was minimal even with the window slightly open. I was located on the top floor so that may have helped cut down on noise.The hotel was also convenient to the subway system, restaurants, shopping (with a grocery store just a few doors away) and to the port, which was where I would be headed after my stay.The only drawback is the lobby area. It is on the narrow side so at check out , it was a bit tight with many people attempting to leave at about the same time. To their credit, the bellman did hussle to get everyone a taxi and on their way.The price I paid was about $240 per night. Some might think it was too high or maybe a better deal could have been available through a *cheaphotel/priceline* site. I was ok with what it cost.I would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>My Home in Barca My third stay in the Royal and not my last. This hotel is spotlessly clean, very well priced considering the fantastic location it enjoys and the staff are very helpful.The rooms are very well appointed and the Rambla view is a must, I began everyday and ended everynight sitting by the window watching the street below. With the windows closed you won't hear a single sound from the busy city.The Royal Hotel is very well placed, being just a stone throw away from Placa de Catalunya, two subway stations and many of Barcelona's attractions.If you are going to Barcelona you could do a lot worse than staying here.

<Content>Location-location-location My wife and I stayed here Nov. 29-Dec3,2007. We arrived on the A1 bus from the airport for 3.90 Euros per person to a bus stop at the head of Las Ramblas. About a 5 minute walk. This hotel was perfect for our needs. Book a room facing the street. There is a supermarket 2 minutes downhill from the hotel. The only downside is the 2 twin beds pushed together to form the bed. It is clean and the staff was wonderful. We left our luggage behind after checking out to tour the city until boarding our cruise ship. Beware Americans, our dollar is worth almost nothing in Europe. A Miller beer costs $7.50. The room was over $220 a day. Go anyway, Barcelona is The most beautiful city we have seen. Get a two day pass on the tourist bus to see the city.

<Content>Very Disappointing Viewl We've just returned from The Royal, and were very disappointed with our room, we were situated at the back of the Hotel, so just looked onto other rooms. (I know someone has too), but request front facing rooms.The bar area was poor, as other reviews have suggested, and also the lack of Coffee/Tea facilities would suggest its not really a 4 star hotel. Also the inability of the night time staff to order a taxi was disappointing,The location of the hotel is ideal, with easy access to many bars/restaurants, turistic bus etc.

<Content>Great hotel for week end break Never been to Barcelona before but booked this after much research. We had booked a room overlooking La Rambla and no noise! even though it is always busy. Hotel close to tour buses, bars, restaurants, tapas bars you name its there. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, rooms exactly as photography on their website, always plenty of hot water, very clean and our room was ready even when we arrived earlier than we had specified. Didnt use the restaurant as so many other places so closeby couldnt try them all in the limited time we were there. Would definately recommend this, a good 4* hotel in an unbeatable location, with easy links from airport.

<Content>excellent hotel on the ramblas I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights in a superior room, which I found to be excellent. The view from the room was good, and there was no noise from the ramblas due to the excellent double glazing. The room was kept immaculately clean and fresh and sheets and pillow cases were changed daily. We could make tea at any time as there was a facility room adjacent to the corridor where there were tables, and books etc left presumably by fellow travellers. Staff were efficient and friendly.The hotel restaurant, was open to the general public, and although the food was good, being a very busy restaurant, staff made no difference between residents at the hotel and people dropping in from the street.There is a lovely local type restaurant, which served good breakfasts and meals, at a very reasonable price, in the street to the left directly opposite the front door of the hotel. The restaurant was named SantAna and was aprroximatley 100 metres along that street on the right hand side.The hotel could not be more central or easier to reach from the airport.If you are lucky enough to have one of the rooms looking on to the ramblas, see if you can spot the team of about 10 people, who operate the the scam with the domino type game. See the slim man with baseballcap leaning against the traffic light outside the restaurant window, and the man who leans against the tree at the other side of the street. They are lookouts..See if you can spot the blonde and brunettewho pose as holidaymakers but stop to play the game as if by chance. Then there are the players themselves and their other lookouts. It canbe fun watching them and how quickly they disappear when the police appear

<Content>Book a Superior Design Ramblas View Room Our room was directly overlooking Las Ramblas, with the windows closedthere was no street noise. The superior room was worth the extra splurge. It was beautifully decorated, very sleek, clean, and modern. If you're looking for old world charm this isn't the place, but if you're into modern amenties, a killer rainshower, and a great location, this is it. As another reviewer mentioned, the staff were not overly friendly, but efficient. The hotel is located very close to the Metro, tourist buses, airport shuttle bus, etc. With limited time in Barcelona (only two days), this hotel made sight-seeing easy and convenient. Breakfast was not included in our rate so I cannot rate it. However, there are many great small eateries nearby, as well as the popular La Boquiera marketplace, just a block or two down Las Ramblas from the hotel.Gaudi's Casa Batllo as well as the La Sagrada Familia are both worthwhile visits, as well as the Picasso Museum.

<Content>Great location in a great city! The Hotel Royal Ramblas is a beautiful hotel in a great location! It is right in the middle of the Ramblas and all of Barcelona's best action. We were able to catch a tour bus just a couple of blocks away, which took us to all of the city's best sights. Great breakfast, too! After our stay, we were able to take a short taxi ride to the port, where our honeymoon cruise left!

<Content>Really Enjoyed the Royal Hotel Barcelona We had never been to Barcelona before so we had to guess where a good location would be. I searched centrally located hotels using a tour book map. Las Ramblas seemed a good location for sightseeing throughout the city. I found the Royal Hotel in a list of hotels on a travel website. Using the hotel's own website (which was very good), we decided this hotel would be where we would want to be. We were a little concerned about noise being right on Las Ramblas, but the hotel ensured that the windows were double sealed. The Royal Hotel far exceeded our expectations. The location was absolutely perfect. We took the express airport bus from the airport directly to the Playca Catalunya which was only a few blocks walk to the hotel. The checkin was very easy, and having just endured an overnight flight across the Atlantic, we were very pleased to be able to checkin earlier than expected. The room itself was very nice (it could have used more drawers for clothing) and the bathroom was nice too. Our room looked directly onto Las Ramblas and we truly enjoyed watching the constant parade of people at all hours of the day and night. The hotel was correct in that the room was well insulated from noise, considering the location. We opted to include the daily breakfast downstairs each day (for 9 euros per person per day). It was a great selection of food and the service was good; everyone was very nice. One evening, after a long day of sightseeing, we even used the restaurant for dinner (really good pizza). You can't beat sitting at the big windows overlooking the parade of people on the street and across to Las Ramblas. We would stay here again and recommend it highly to any visitors to Barcelona.

<Content>Great location Great location and for that alone would recommend staying here. Excellent double glazing and no noise from street. Hotel very clean , staff efficient, not friendy, not unfriendly. Does not have all the facilities you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Bar is a vending machine although very cheap. Overnight rates are high and do not include breakfast. Had some problems with work been carried out in room next door, after 3 compalints was moved to suite and given discount of 100 euros. However taking all above into account would probably stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic Location The Hotel Royal is a wonderful choice for a short vacation in Spain. It's location is within walking distance of the Picasso, Chocolate and other museums. It is also very close to the Playa du Catalanya which is where the main bus tours of the city begin. The only glitch was a little bit of trouble with the deadbolt on the door.Otherwise, the reception and other hotel staff were excellent. They gave us recommendations for nearby bars and restaurants which were excellent choices. The room was clean, spacious by european standards and well appointed. We had a wonderful view of Las Ramblas which is a cultural experience in itself.We will stay there again on our next trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Great hotel, i suggest it Great location., at city center on Rambla near catalunya square. Visit the city from this hotel is easy, Transport facilities like underground (6 lines) and bus stops are along Rambla near the hotel. Rooms are large and clean. Reception services are good, you can leave your luggage in hotel after check-out without problems (your bags will be stored in a closed room and identified by a personal number). The restaurant is lightly expensive but nearly there are several kind of restaurants (Tapas bar, pizzeria, ecc.). Great hotel,I'll return.

<Content>nice hotel with a perfect location I stayed 8 nights. The position of the hotel was excellent, close to a supermarket and all the stores. Nice and professional staff. I did not hear much from the La Rambla streets, but sometimes from the neighbour next door. Do not eat at the restaurant, you will be very disappointed, no one finish their meals there. The breakfast is ok, but very expensive (9 euros for each person). Do not eat at restaurants located on La Rambla. I would go back to Royal and I recommend it.

<Content>Definitely not a 4-star hotel!!! We stayed for three nights in Royal Hotel. The hotel website where we booked shows quite a modern hotel with spacious rooms but does not show the true picture. When we booked our room was shown as a standard room. There was barely enough room for the bed and table. There was one window in the room but the only view was the building directly beside the hotel - it was impossible to tell whether it was night or day - the room was so dark. I do not understand how this hotel warrants 5 stars - I have stayed in better BandBs.

<Content>excellent location! The location of this hotel makes it perfect for a weekend stay. We had a superior room overlooking las ramblas, that perhaps didint warrant the 'superior' title, but nothing to complain about. being so close to catalunya square meant the taxi rank, metro and bus stop for city tours were literally two minutes away- we opted for a 10-ride metro ticket at 6 euros to get around and couldnt fault it! we ate at the adjoining restaurant one night, and it was nothing to write home about- its worth venturing off the ramblas for cheaper and more authentic food, but the royals location means that everywhere is easily accesible. would return there for this reason.

<Content>Central Location Not a bad hotel but certainly not worth the 4star rating or 4star prices!!, the rooms are very clean and functional but are very small. The staff are friendly and willing to help. In-room tea and coffee facilities would be a bonus.. The location of this hotel makes it ideal for exploring all of Barcelona.

<Content>Very Good Royal... Spent three nights at the Royal Ramblas in May. We found the hotel on Tripadvisor and advised our travel agent to book.We could not have picked a better location. Right at the Northern end of this legendary boulevard, access to the Gothic center, the best artisan and designer shopping plus the central produce market, is all within a ten-minute walk The hotel was mostly good. We felt that the room was a little small but was kept scupriously clean. The breakfast buffet was among the best of the sixteen hotels we encountered on our tour and as it is located on the ground floor, right on the street, feels like a proper caf茅. We especially liked the tortilla. Not many hotel kitchens offered food form the region for breakfast during the tour. A tip for eating in Barcelona - be wary of any of the restaurants on the Ramblas itself. Much better option is to venture a little into the side streets. You do not have to go far to experience excellent offerings.Do visit the Market for a look and breakfast or lunch 鈥?lots of fresh fruit salads and juices plus all the Jamon and olives you can eat. Overall a very good hotel and efficient front desk staff who had good English speaking skills.

<Content>A central and pleasant hotel I have visited several times this property and must say that I have always been pleased.Room not huge but pleasant and in a good state of repair, everything was working. Bathroom quite adequate.Bar is very nice and the barman knows his job.Staff quite pleasant, helpful and knowledgeable.Excellent buffet breakfast.No restaurant but the one next door is quite good, food and service more than acceptable and reasonable pricing. The location is quite good but I do not like driving in Barcelona, finding a parking space etc and have opted now for hotels outside Barcelona, but this has nothing to do with the ROYAL.ALL IN ALL I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THIS PROPERTY.

<Content>Fabulous! Very central hotel with helpful staff ideally located to explore sights of city. Metro entrance  Tourist info booth right outside and 2mins from tourist bus starting point. Easily able to walk to the Port area and Gaudi's Casa Batlo in short time from hotel. Stayed in a lovely medium room with no view but we were out and about more often than in hotel! Large bathroom with great shower and walk in wardrobe with safe. Breakfast was simple continental at 9euro each while watching the street performers warming up. Restaurant in evening was little overpriced but loads of other places nearby including Attic opposite (yum!)  Les Quinze Nits and Taxidermista are 5min walk away beside a couple of lively Irish bars in Placa Reial.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Nothing to fault about this hotel, stayed overnight before a cruise, wished we could have stayed longer. The staff were so accomodating and very friendly. Room was clean and very spacious , we requested a room at the back of the hotel, not much of a view but it was lovely and quiet. The hotel is centrally located, we got the bus from the airport, the bus stop is right outside the terminals and only costs just under 4euros each. A short 3 minute walk and you are at the hotel. We will definetly be returning later in the year.

<Content>Great Location, first impression not so good, but don't be put off by this When you walk into this hotel the first impression is disappointing. There is a lack of public space in this hotel but you are right at the top of the Ramblas so pretty much everything you need is close by.The location is fantastic and the room is clean and the furnishings are of a good standard. The bathroom was spotless and kept that way throughout our stay.There is no tea making facility in the room and room service finishes at 9.00pm so you are unable to get a hot drink in your room. Once you get used to this you take care of your needs before going back, but it would be nice to have this facitity for the mornings.

<Content>Highly recommended We took a short city break in Barcelona last week and selected the Royal primarily for its location but the hotel more than met our expectations in every conceivable department..At the top of the bustling Ramblas, between the beautiful Barra Goticand the more sensory Raval district, with the Mediterranean at one end of the street and the main transport hub of Playa Catalunya a few steps away at the other, the location is indeed unbeatable.Though residents have all the activity they can require right outsidethe front door the hotel is a haven of peace and tranquility. The staff were unfailingly courteous and helpful, the ambience was businesslike yet informal, the furnishings were top-notch and the view from the high floors (we were right at the top) was fantastic.On a short break and with a multiplicity of dining options available nearby - the seafood in the Port Olimpic area was a particular magnetin the evening - we unfortunately found only time for one breakfast at the hotel but it was first class.The city of Barcelona is far more beautiful than I expected and three nights was simply not enough. We plan to return later in the year and we now wouldn't consider staying anywhere other than at the Royal.

<Content>Hotel Royal disappointment My Husband and I booked a three night stay in Apr 07 at the 4 star (?) Hotel Royal on Las Ramlas. It worked out cheapest to book directly with the hotel via the website however we feel, after staying, that the hotel is over-priced and over-rated. In our opinionit should only just scrape a 3 star rating. The hotel is bland and unwelcoming although the reception and housekeeping staff were friendly. There are absolutely no facilities within the hotel so you really are just paying for a room. The tv was old and could only pickup one English speaking channel - CNN. We appreciate that you don't go away on a city break to watch tv but it's nice to have the option as it is a facility advertised and one which you are paying for afterall. If you like to iron your clothes before an evening out, take a travel iron as the hotel does not have one you can use. Also take a travel kettle as the rooms do not have tea/coffee making facilities.The adjoining 'restaurant' was expensive and the menu limited and unimaginative especially for vegans/vegetarians. The pizzas look better than they taste and the complimementary olives tasted stale. The salad consisted of a handful of mixed leaves and half a tomato! Overall, we would not recommend this hotel and will not be returning to Barcelona. Apart from some nice architecture, the city is dirty, overcrowded and really you could be in any other city in Europe... plenty of Starbucks, Mc Donald's and Burger King's if that's your thing. We were particularly upset to see caged birds of all varietiesfor sale along Las Ramblas and the pet shops were also archaic selling puppies on show in glass fronted cages. If you are still tempted to visit, stay in a hotel off the Las Ramblas as I think you will get a much better deal. Transport around the city is good so getting about is easy. Use the Aerobus to and from the airport - cheaper and less hassle that the Metro.

<Content>Good all round The hotel is in an excellent location on Las Ramblas just a stones throw from Catalunya square. Rooms were excellent. Very spacious and clean and exactly what you would expect from a 4* hotel. Only downside to the rooms was that the bed was far too hard. Only had breakfast once but was pretty much what you would expect from a continental breakfast.Overall the hotel was roughly what you would expect to get for the cost. I would recommend it.

<Content>A refreshing break We booked a 4 day trip to Barcelona on the web through BMI baby .com. Chose a hotel at ramdon which turned out to be just right for a short break - The Royal Hotel directly on Las Ramblas. Very comfortable, with all we needed, bed  breakfast and at a reasonable rate. It is ideally placed for walking, reaching the bus services and the restaurants in the evening. For a short break this hotel is recommended.

<Content>Better deals around the corner I booked our hotel through Expedia for only 2 nights, just in case I didn't like the hotel. I'm glad that I did, too. I suggest that anyone thinking of staying here go around the corner (2 min walk) to Hotel Inglaterra. Here's why:1. Our hotel room was freezing cold, colder inside than out, it seemed. I called the front desk to make sure I was operating the A/C correctly and was instructed over the phone what settings to put it on. The room was still freezing the next day, so someone came up and told me that I had actually turned the thing off. I don't think either was correct because I tried every possible setting, the temp was as high as I could set it, and our room was cold the entire time.2. The wireless internet is expensive, 15 euro per day per computer. I paid for the internet and yet I couldn't get a signal. The front desk did rectify this problem by sending me up some big clunky antenna. It worked, but still annoying. When using a laptop, the less wires the better, right?3. The hotel room was very mediocre. It was not 4 stars and definitely not worth the price. The room was boring. I'm not super into decor or anything, but it was basically furnished like a Motel 6 or something. It was clean, but very basic. The television was old and didn't work properly.This hotel is not terrible, but it's just OK. I highly recommend going around the corner to Hotel Inglaterra, where I stayed for the rest of my trip.

<Content>Would recommend Hotel Royal on Las Ramblas seems to get quite varied reviews. Mines is a favourable one. I chose the hotel primarily for location. It certainly lived up to that. Very central, at the top of Las Ramblas and at Place Catalunya. You are within walking distance to shops, bars, restaurants and metro stations. Appearance wise I think it is quite typical of a 4 star Spanish hotel. We had a decent sized room on the 6th floor which most importantly was very clean. I found the hotel staff we dealt with efficient and helpful, although we didnt really need a lot of assistance from them. If you are looking for a well located, clean, pleasant and not overpriced hotel in the city then this is a good choice. There is so much to see and do in Barcelona - La Parc Guell, Sagrada Familia (both must see's). We navigated our way around using both the metro and bus system. Fairly simple and saves on taxis. If you walk straight down Las Ramblas, heading to the beach you will come across Maremagnum. A self contained entertainment complex of shops, bars and restaurants with lovely views out to sea and the harbour area. We spent our last night there. Very nice relaxed atmosphere. A great end to a great holiday.Drinks wise, stay off of Las Ramblas. A pint and a JD and coke came to 19 euros in a bar on the main drag. It is worth venturing into the side streets for much nicer and cheaper bars. If you are a fan of cocktails, seek out Rita Blues. An average round of 2 cocktails came in at 13 euros.This was our first time in Barcelona and cant wait to go back.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at Hotel Royal in Barcelona with our two kids in June 2006. The location is great, rates were reasonable. I have to admit that this is no 4-star hotel - we had two connected rooms for our family and both were rather smallish for a claimed 4-star hotel. We didn't try the restaurant on-site as there are plenty around La Rambla for breakfast/lunch/dinner. We would stay there again.

<Content>Great Location but not a four star hotel Booked the designer rooms x 3 in September 06 only to get an email 2 days before we were due to arrive saying the rooms were not available! We were put in superior rooms but nothing superior about them. I admit they were clean with ok furniture. Bathroom big enough. This is not a 4 star hotel more like a 3. The best thing about this hotel is the great location right on The Ramblas. Staff were just ok. Self service bar area from vending machines. 25cl bottle wine 3 euro. The bar area is just off the small reception and has approx 10 seats. No atmosphere what so ever. Barcelona is a fab city to visit and would definately go back but stay at the 1898 Hotel on the Ramblas.

<Content>only use royal floor prime location on las rambla,no need to book breakfast which is served in restaraunt next door as countless coffee shops in immediate area.same applies for bar facilities,dont need a hotel bar when you are surrounded by them in streets on and off las rambla.go off the main drag for cheaper prices. used barcelonahotels.com to book 4 months in advance and got a great deal(130 euros per night +7% tax) for a room on the royal floor.only thing missing from our room was the jacuzzi stated on the hotels website!

<Content>Excellent central location This hotel offers a excellent central location right on the La Ramblas, the hotel is very very clean the staff where average when it came to assistance and friendlyness I think this was because it is not a family run hotel and is part of a chain. Like all places around europe you just need to be assertive and try not to be to British and agree with what the staff want. Would stop there again but the price was above what we would usually pay.Colin  Shaun, Durham England

<Content>Not 4 Star My son and I stayed at this hotel from 29 December to 2nd Jan. I have stayed in many 4 star hotels and as such would not rate this hotel as 4 star for the following reasons:Hotel bedroom was far too hot and when we tried to put the temperature down we couldn't. When contacting the reception they said it was not possible as it was winter! This hotel advertises that it has climate control rooms. Having said this the staff were very helpful in getting us a stand alone fan but really a 4 star hotel should have the facility that individuals can control the temperature of their room.Very basic toiletries in the bathroom - enough for 1 person even though it was a twin room.They state it has WiFi and then charge you 15 euros per day to use it. The signal strength was very low and it kept logging off! Took me over an hour to get it sorted.Meal we had in the Hotel restaurant was not good and expensive for what we had. The Hotel lobby/lounge area was that of a 2/3 star hotel offering a couple of vending machines for drinks!They advise Satellite English TV - this was CNN and Eurosport!The only thing that was good about this Hotel was its location. It is on top of everything. As far as facilities it offers I would definitely rate this as no more than a 3 star charging 4 star rates.

<Content>Not the romantic night we had hoped for I have not read previous reviews as I wanted to post an unbiased account of our experience. Apologies if I repeat what others have said.My partner booked this as a surprise and we stayed just the one night following some time in a nearby coastal resort. We are well travelled and so I now know that she had rang ahead to check the reservation.Our disappointment started when on arrival they had still managed to misplace our booking. We therefore were 'upgraded' to the pieso royale or royal floor. The rooms on this floor (on further inspection) seem to be newly rennovated compared to the higher floors. They are very contemporary in style and although small, seemed very comfortable with excellent double glazing virtually blocking all noise from las ramblas. One thing we did note was although we ordered a double, the beds were actually two singles pushed together. That said, they were extremely clean and comfortable.The main issue with this hotel is the noise at night. The pieso royale is (as it turned out) directly over the restaurant and we were kept awake until gone 2am by the constant scraping of chairs across the lower floor, people talking loudly etc. They should be more aware of their guests, especially claiming to be a 4 star (which it falls far short of being by the way). The noise starts again early in the morning (presumably for breakfast, which we then missed on account of being so tired). We did ask for a room change but the hotel was apparently full.Next, the 'bar' is nothing of the sort as the sliding door through to the cafe next door will reveal. So even a quiet drink whilst the noise subsided was out of the question, as it meant mixing with everyone from the street.Next time in Barcelona, we would choose a hotel where you can actually get some sleep, important if you intend doing any sightseeing the following day!

<Content>Crazy surroundings I booked 3 design rooms (2 doubles and 1 family suite) on the Royal Floor for 4 nights starting on 12/27. I was attracted to this hotel because they had a family suite and the location, but unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the hotel for a number of reasons. Although there were a few good points, I would choose not to stay here again:Pros:鈥oom price was very reasonable: 130 euros for first two nights/195 euros for last two nights on double rooms; 250 euros for family suite.鈥ocation on Las Ramblas (if you like very busy surroundings). It鈥檚 near Placa Catalunya (transportation hub), shopping and the interesting Barri Gotic area 鈥esign room had two sinks in the family suite; pefect for a family of 4鈥ouble rooms on the Royal Floor faced Las Ramblas. This made for great people-watching.鈥ainshower and Jacuzzi bath were nice to have available after a long day of touring鈥a Poma Restaurant is next to the hotel and they provide room service. Their pizzas were OK, pastas not too good, but surprisingly, their paella was pretty good.鈥levators were always readily waiting on the ground floor.鈥here are lots of good restaurant nearby, but best to choose one on the side streets off Las Ramblas (because of price and quality)鈥?-5 minute walk to Boqueria market鈥onvenience store a few doors down. We bought our water and soda there when lines weren鈥檛 excessively long as they tend to be in the later afternoon.Cons:鈥lthough rooms were sound-proof from the noise on the streets, there was constant noise from the restaurant below, which you could clearly hear from our rooms (#8, 9 and 11) You can hear them moving chairs around, vacuuming and generally moving things around until 2am. Other reviewers mentioned this as well. 鈥ome nights were so busy on Las Ramblas that it was a chore just to walk through the crowds. Hotel staff said this is typical of weekend nights. 鈥taff was cordial, but not very helpful. They did not offer restaurant recommendations, but rather, gave me a map with restaurants shown. I asked for their personal preferences in the area and was told on 2 occasions that most of the restaurants are good 鈥?they just didn鈥檛 say which ones!鈥ad to have our keys for the family suite re-programmed 3 times. Reception was apologetic, but did not know why this was occurring.鈥here is no coffee/tea service in the room. There鈥檚 a Royal Salon for those staying on the Royal Floor which provides tea service but the Salon opens at 8am or 8:30 or 9am 鈥?depending when staff decides to open up. I asked the front desk about this, but they said it should open at 7:30am. You can, instead, grab some coffee in the breakfast room which opens at 7:30 or purchase in the machine in the lobby for one euro. So, if you鈥檙e an early riser, like me, you鈥檒l have to wait for your morning beverage!There鈥檚 no concierge or phone book available. I had to rely on the reception staff who were not openly helpful.鈥his is not a four star hotel in the 鈥渢raditional鈥?sense. They might have received a 4 star rating because there鈥檚 a restaurant and because of the location. It couldn鈥檛 possibly be because of the services or amenities.Please beware - the lower Ramblas (toward the water) is a bit seedy, especially at night. If I were to return to Barcelona, I鈥檇 choose a location on the Passeig de Gracia. It鈥檚 amazing how much less crowded and crazy things are on that opposite side of Placa Catalunya - but, of course, it鈥檚 considerably more expensive. We had the most amazing and wonderful tours with Spanish Trail. I鈥檒l post a review under tours in Barcelona.

<Content>100% Location fantastic location I booked a superior room. I was very dissapointed and thought it would be special, it was only comparable to a 3 star. Had twin beds, i'd asked for a double, no tea/coffee in room, minibar expensive. but room was clean, if a little small. I wonder if things had been better if i had requested a non smokers room? do the smokers get the bad deal??however i'd go again, but pay for basic room, afterall, there is so much to see and do in this city, you'd spend very little time in it anyway!!

<Content>Great location and style We were attracted to the hotel by the excellent location at the top of La Rambla and its good ratings. We were not disappointed. The designer room was well worth the extra cost if only for the great wet room rain shower. The sound proofing kept out the noise of the city when we wanted it to and the discrete blinds gave you privacy without blocking out the view of the entertainers below in the street. . The breakfast started early but went on late till long after 10 am and that meant you could be a late riser after a night out and still have time for a leisurely start to the day. The food choice was very good.If you fly into the city, don't waste your money on a taxi. Get the Aerobus from the airport to Placa Catalunya for only 3.75 Euro and the hotel is literally a few minutes walk across the square into La Rambla.

<Content>Perfect Location We stayed in a family room on the royal floor, which was perfect for 4 of us. The room was lovely, and very clean. Incidentally, no security problems as there was a safe in the room which we used at all times. The breakfast was not very good - only used for convenience! Not cheap, but not many places with family rooms in Barcelona.

<Content>Disappointing Expected more from a 4* hotel.We arrived and were told that our room would be ready in 20 minutes. Opted to go out for lunch, and returned 2 hours later, to be told that there was a problem with the room, and that we'd get a different room - but had to wait another 15 minutes for this one to be made ready! We were told that the room was just as good, though we know (from fire drawings) that our first room was a bit bigger, and also an end room. The room was also supposed to be sound-proof, but we heard noises all night long - amongst other things, it sounded as though people were moving furniture around constantly.We had booked a Superior Design Suite, but the quality of finish was not 100%. In addition, the beds were ridiculously hard! Breakfast was not included in our room price, which we were surprised about.It was fine being central, but we would not stay here again.

<Content>Great spot Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Royal and would definitely return. We splashed out and stayed in a family design room (2 adults  2 children) on the Royal floor which was lovely - modern, spacious and very clean (and I am very fussy!). The tea-making facilities/magazines in the lounge next door and the rain shower /jacuzzi bath in the bathroom were a real plus. The children enjoyed the sweets left for them by the maid at bedtime!The location cannot be beaten - we were able to walk to most places or take the metro (station is right outside the hotel) and felt we were in the heart of things although the hotel was very quiet inside. We ate breakfast in the hotel on our first morning which was only just o.k. but not worth the 9 euros per person - the best thing about it was being able to eat whilst watching the street entertainers on La Rambla outside.

<Content>Great Hotel and Great Location This hotel is located in a great location if you like to shop, use the hop on/ hop off tour buses, and be close to a lot of activity. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. The first room we got was very smokey smelling. The hotel was booked for the night but the next day they were able to move us to a non-smoking room. The windows to the hotel face the busy Ramblas but with the double windows you can't hear all the activity going on outside. I was very pleased with the cleanliness and location of this hotel especially for the price. Make sure you walk down the Ramblas to the open air market were you can but fresh squeezed fruit juices (try the mango juice it was very good).

<Content>Hotel Royal was great We stayed at Hotel Royal for a pre-cruise stay. It was a lovely hotel right on Las Ramblas. Great location to walk just about everywhere in the main part of Barcelona or to access the Touristic bus. We loved Barcelona - lots to see and extremely clean even in the little windy alleyways in the gothic quarter. We would go back in a heartbeat and stay at Hotel Royal!

<Content>Good value at the Royal, Barcelona Well located on La Rambla at the the Place de Catalunya end. Comfortable if slightly compact superior room overlooking La Rambla. Wonderful double-window sound insulation rather than double glazing ensured the street noises were shut out except when one opened the inner and/or outer windows. House keeping standards excellent. Breakfast very good, though long queues to get coffee from single coffee machine was a bit frustrating. Staff could have been friendlier though nonetheless efficient.Will reurn.

<Content>Pick a better spot We stayed 2 nights at this average hotel that is priced above average. The room was pretty nice but there was nothing in the hotel beyond that- the lobby is very small with only facilities being a couple beverage despensers. The elevators were small.We didnt eat there as it was expensive.The staff was ok. It is just not anything special for 140 E excluding tax and no breakfast. Confirmation said internet facilities yet there were none.

<Content>Hotel Royal on Las Ramblas We spent 4 nights staying at the Hotel Royal in Las Ramblas. The location is perfect. It's at the top of Las Ramblas, about 150m from the Placa de Catalunya and around 400m from the Liceu metro station (which is about half way down Las Ramblas). The main tourist buses leave from Placa de Catalunya and a number of metro and train lines intersect there.The hotel is also 40m away from the 'Champion' supermarket on Las Ramblas. If you don't want to pay hotel minibar prices or fancy a quick snack you can just nip to the supermarket (although you won't be short of places to eat on Las Ramblas). We bought bottles of water from the supermarket (19 cents each) and stocked our minibar with those - althought that probably annoyed the maid!Overall, we were happy with the hotel although we had a couple of minor issues (see below). We found the staff helpful and professional. The room was clean with a view over Las Ramblas, although the decor was slightly dated in the room we had. The TV had the usual satellite fare (ie. apart from the Spanish channels it was one channel per language). The safe was electronic. The rooms are very well sound-proofed and even thought it's the busiest street in Barcelona we could hardly hear a thing. Although the service had a few personal touches (eg. the porter taking the bags up to the room), it seems to be a hotel that focuses on professional rather than personal service.Having a room with a view over Las Ramblas cost an extra 20 Euro's per night but we thought it was worth it. The street is busy until late into the night with a variety of performing artists. After returning from sightseeing (between 7 and 8pm) and before going out for dinner (sometime after 9.30pm) we would just sit and just watch the street. We had 2 minor issues. When we first arrived we were put into a smoking room (when we had booked a non-smoking room). It stank, as almost all smoking rooms do. It also had a connecting door to the adjacent room and we could hear everything that was going on. We immediately asked to move to a different room and we were moved as soon as an appropriate room had been prepared (which was about 10 minutes). When we arrived in the new room it was much better although it had no toiletries. A quick phone call to the reception and toiletries were provided within a few minutes.

<Content>great hotel on Las Ramblas We stayed at the Hotel Royal right in the heart of Las Ramblas. When we checked in, there was some confusion as to our reservation, which was I had confirmed, cancelled, and confirmed again on line. It was not the fault of the hotel and they were very accommodating by giving us a room, with a great view. The service at Hotel Royal was great. The room was nice and the buffet breakfast was very good. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. It was located in a the middle of Las Ramblas which was great for walking to the port or for the city tour buses. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Average Hotel The Royal Hotel is very average. I saw pictures of the Royal Floor in the hotel lobby and those rooms may have been a bit more luxurious, ours was very average. We could have been in a Holiday Inn or any other basic hotel in any city. They should upgrade all rooms rather than have one fancy floor. The bed was similar to what you may find in a college dorm - it felt like there was a big plastic bag around the matress. Strange. The bathroom was good, nice amenities.The staff was very friendly and spoke English, always helpful! The location cannot be beat - you're in a great area on La Rambla. The Picasso Museum, Market, Gaudi House, Barri Gothic are all within walking distance (if you don't mind walking). I would recommend the Royal, just don't expect anything 5 star.

<Content>fantastic! fantastic! fantastic!! My husband and I wanted to treat ourselves while in Barcelona so we looked around on the web, and combined with the hotel's website and tripadvisor reviews, we selected a room in the Royal Floor. If you do stay here, get this room/floor!!! The room and floor directly looks over Las Ramblas so you can see some of the stalls and street entertainers. The room is so quiet you could here a pin drop, plus they have the block out curtains so it can be pitch black if you choose it or there is an automatic screen. We ended up sleeping about 10hrs which is unheard of for us!! The bathroom, decor, room size, flat screen tv, and reception service were also of very high standards. The air con was also a treat at the end of the day! We got our beds turned down each night with some chocolate things. It was a twin bed, so expect that going into it. We didnt do the breakfast (because we slept in!) as we went shopping for fresh fruits, breads, meats at the Bouqueria Markets (3 blocks down on the Las Ramblas). However, the breakfast area was of similar modern decor. THe location puts you in the hub of everything! We did spend another night in another hotel to try a different one (it was a 5 star) but after staying there we decided that Hotel Royal was much better!

<Content>Great location, standard hotel Booked 2 nights stay at Royal Hotel while on a road trip around Europe with my boyfriend after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor.com. While I agree that the hotel is in a great location (our Lastminute deal got us a room overlooking La Rambla), it is a pretty standard hotel without much character at all and left us feeling that we could have been anywhere in the world, including an airport hotel in UK...Staff were very helpful and welcoming on arrival but didn't mention the fact that we had to pay extra for the car parking which i feel they should have done just to clarify things. The first room we were put into had dodgy air conditioning so we complained to reception and then waited 1 hr for somebody to come and repair it. When nobody came, the guy did apologise and put us into another room. The bathroom was really nice and clean with a good shower and nice little freebies but the decor of the room was your usual business hotel type interior. We chose not to have breakfast as at 10 euros each we easily found many other places to choose from at half the price. So all in all, Royal Hotel is in a great location with good staff but is a rather old-school hotel lacking in style and character which is disappointing when you're in a city like Barcelona.

<Content>Fantastic - stay here!!! Just back from a week long stay at the Royal Hotel, absolutely great hotel, we paid extra for a designer room with a view of La Rambla - well worth. The room was ultra modern with a big window opening up on to La Rambla. It was sound proofed which is an absolute must if staying on La Rambla. The room was spotless and very comfortable and reasonably spacious. The floor we were on had a room with tea and coffee facilities which is great in a European hotel where a kettle in the room doesn't exist!!! The staff were helpful and had good English.However the hotel breakfast is overpriced for what you get as in all of the hotels on LaRambla, try the cafe across the road beside the Citadines Hotel.The location was brilliant, the hotel is at the Placa de Catalunya (where all of the tourist and airport buses leave from) end of La Rambla, which was a safer and nicer area after midnight.Barcelona itself is a great place for a holiday, totally recommend the tourist bus - definitely worth the money. Also be sure to visit Montserrat - outstanding sight and worth the trip. The aquarium is too expensive for the twenty minute walk around it. Visit both Gaudi houses, as La Predrera is worth seeing for the roof and Casa Batllo for the apartment. Sagrada Familia is definitely worth a visit but not the climb - not much to see at the top!And goes without saying - watch your bag and pockets!!

<Content>Excellent Location  We just loved our 3 week trip to Spain, including Barcelona as our last stop. And what a destination - so much to see and do....a beautiful city !Our stay at the Royal Hotel, right on La Ramblas, is definitely the place to stay ! We had booked our reservation via internet; the Long stay promotion 4 nights  more, and had decided to splurge and book their twin Design Room on the Royal Floor. The pictures and comments do not lie. You do have a view directly on La Ramblas, the place to be, with a very large window (double panes), therefore blocking all noises from this very, very busy street. The room was very modern, but not over the top, large marble shower, beds were very comfortable and everything was new  clean. Rooms on this floor, also included free internet access. As an added touch, only clients of this floor have access to the Royal Lounge where a selection of teas and sparking wine (yes it's true) , little black chocolates, a basket of apples and magazines are available from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. You can relax right there (where a few tables are set up) or bring your champagne flutes or cups to your own room. It was really a very enjoyable bonus.The Royal Hotel is indeed very close to Plaza Cataluyna where the touristic buses  the metro are located. By the way, it is an excellent way to visit Barcelona as you can hop on  off to visit the sights. The city is so big, that we were very happy to have taken the 48-hour pass (24 hour is also available). The Royal Hotel is very, very centrally located- close to the Gothic quarters, side streets full of charm, shops, restos, down the street is the Port  Marina. And what to say of La Ramblas! Alive ! Restaurant terrasses, very creative street performers, shops, flower stands, theaters... Needless to say, if you do not like crowds, stay away. However, if you like to be right-smack in the action and stay in A-1 hotel, then the Royal Hotel is the place to stay!!! We were very satisfied and will recommend this hotel to all our friends and family.Before we left we asked to view one of their regular, standard rooms, and must say they also seemed very comfortable with tradtional Spanish style furniture. Same double-pane windows - good size rooms, clean, large bathrooms.One thing did surprise us as this is truly a 4-star hotel - there was no lobby-bar. It really didn't bother us that much. However, it would definitely be a plus for the hotel instead of their vending machines. They were, however, in the midst of opening a wall from the hotel right into the Poma restaurant, so I guess it may kind-of solve this little inconvenience.A five minute walk will take you to a little jewel of a restaurant we found - the L'Oliva on Calle Jovellanos where the food was excellent, really not expensive, service great. Their salmon al cava cooked in a sparking wine was to die for. It literally melted in your mouth. Please note they are closed on Sundays - we very disappointed cause we really wanted to go back. Have a great time in Barcelona ! ! !

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! The Hotel Royal is in a brilliant location on La Rambla right in the heart of Barcelona. The staff was overly helpful and very attentive. We stayed on the Royal floor and it was perfect - all the amenities you could want, including a Salon always open with Cava (Champagne!), water, tea and chocolates! I would definitely stay at Hotel Royal again!

<Content>Modern, clean  We stayed at the Royal for 3 nights during our honeymoon. Honestly, I have no complaints about the room, the service or the location. The room was nice, modern, and really clean. The staff were so friendly and helpful. And, most important, the location....right on Las Ramblas!!! I would definitely recommend staying here!

<Content>Perfect! I just got back from an 8 night stay at Hotel Royal and what can I say - it was GREAT! The location could not have been better - right on Las Ramblas, close to a major subway station, and in walking distance to just about everything you'd want to see or do in Barcelona, from shopping to sightseeing and museum hopping. The hotel itself actually exceeded my expectations. I was in a triple and was concerned that we would feel extremely confined, but the room size was sufficient and our ammenities included a minibar, an in-room safe, and even a bidet in the bathroom. The hotel is very clean and modern, and the staff, from the front desk to the cleaning women, were all very friendly and helpful. It was truly the perfect place for us - we kept saying to one another I love our hotel! While in Barcelona we passed many of the other hotels that we considered for this trip, and not once did we wish we had stayed at one of these other establishments, including ones that were much more expensive. So, for value, location, ammenities, and stellar service, Hotel Royal is a great choice. I would stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Loved the Royal! My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Royal. The location of the hotel was perfect for walking to everything you wanted to see and do on the Rambla, around the Port, the Plaza Catalonia, even the Gaudi sights, which were nearby. The metro, bus and taxi services are a minute walk.The hotel service and staff were excellent: friendly, helpful and always greeted you with an hola and a smile. Their restaurant recommendations were great.The hotel restaurant (La Poma) was convenient yet a bit pricey...The food was very good though. The breakfast was great: eggs, fruit, cheese, sausage, bacon, pastries, cereal, and open til 11, to allow vacationers to sleep in if they wish. We only have great comments and would definitely recommend the Royal to our friends and family. Our first trip to Barcelona was so memorable, also thanks to the Royal Hotel!!! Barcelona is a vibrant and colourful city to visit: the cultural and architectural diversity are one of a kind.

<Content>Great Hotel!! We walked into the Royal Hotel after the NH de luc Victoria refused to honor our reservation. The Royal Hotel staff was incredible, multi-lingual and very helpful. We had two rooms, one huge suite, and one standard size room. Both were great, with very comfortable beds. The hotel is right on the placa de catalunya/La Rambla, with hundreds of street performers and some great deals on oil and water color paintings. Recommend Cafe Zurich for a cafe americano and a baquette to start your day off!

<Content>Loved the Royal We only spent a few days at the Royal but were impressed and pleased with the accomodation. We were assigned to the new Royal Floor, which is on the second floor.At check-in I was concerned about the noise level from Rambla, so I was a little suspicious since we requested a quiet room. Not to worry - the rooms are double glazed, with 2 separate heavy glass windows(which can be opened). In fact the second night we stayed Barcelona won the European soccer championship and within an hour therewere at least 10,000 screaming fans setting off fireworks, flares, blowing horns, and generally going insane from 11pm to 2am - we had an incredible view of the celebration.Even with all this going on with the windows closed it was reduced to a tolerable rumble.On a normal day it was uncanny looking out the window- like a human aquarium - you could see all the activity on the street, but couldn't hear a thing!The newly remodelled Royal Floor rooms are gorgeous - very sleek and well thought out and a decent size.Also on that floor is private lounge area for those on the floor, featuring complimentary tea, water, candy, fruit and chilled Cava! For the price (130E) we thought it was an exceptional value and would recommend it highly (be sure to ask for the Royal Floor!)

<Content>Very Caring and Attentive We found the hotel to be very clean and comfortable. The reservation desk was most accommodating and very helpful with storing luggage while arriving early and awaiting an early check-in. The location was excellent. When confronted with a medical problem the staff were more than generous in offerring assistance and very willing to help with further travel arrangement changes, if necessary. We would say that we would definitely recommend this hotel and certainly would not hesitate to stay there upon our return to Barcelona.

<Content>Hotel Royal, la rambla I stayed here from the night Barcelona won until Saturday. i also had a room overlooking the courtyard which was very quiet. Room was very small however and dark. Bathroom minute. Location excellent though. Staff were mostly friendly. They would not however give me an iron. i had to pay someone to do it for me. Ok since on business but every other hotel I have been in has always provided an iron. Security reasons apparently :-)Room service was acceptable. Breakfast was ok if you eat a lot. if you just have a croissant and coffee, it is better to eat out on one of the cafes.

<Content>You pay for its location! We stayed for 3 nights and were amazed by its location- right on the placa de catalunya and at the beginning of La Rambla. The rooms are a good size and clean- staff attentive and multi-lingual. Breakfast expensive but with the huge amount of cafes around, you shouldn't go hungry. Overall, an ideal hotel to see Barca!

<Content>Hotel Royal excellent for sightseers We stayed here for 2 nights and were impressed by the helpful and efficient reception staff who spoke good English. The porter can also store your luggage and call taxis on request.The room was spacious and well decorated with an excellent bathroom, plus hairdryer, tv  mini bar.We were lucky to get an interior room with a window to the central courtyard/well, as Barcelona won the Champions League on our first night there  the loud celebrations went on into the night (although the hotel say that all rooms are soundproofed)!Breakfast was served from 7-11 and cost 鈧?3 for an extensive cold buffet plus a couple of poorer hot items. Again the staff were helpful. Although breakfast could definitely be bought more cheaply elsewhere it makes for a relaxing start to the day.The hotel is located at the top of Las Ramblas, near the metro and Placa de Catalunya, making it an excellent base for sightseeing.All in all we would highly recommend this hotel for a city break.

<Content>Recommend The Royal Having recently stayed at the Royal Hotel Barcelona. I can happily recommend it. the location is excellent right on the Ramblas. The staff are freindly and helpful. We hadn't opted for a deal including breakfast but did choose to have breakfast in the hotel, the choice of food and the freshness were excellent and well worth 13 euros. We hadn't opted for the room with the Ramblas View, this is only 15 euros more and definitely well worth the extra. I would definitely recommend the Royal and will stay there again as I reaaly enjoyed Barcelona. Next time I will opt for the room upgrade as whilst my room was clean and comfortable it was very dark.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Royal for 5 nights to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary 5th to 10th April 2006. The hotels position on the Ramblas is fantastic, next to non. THe staff were extremely helpful and we used the car parking facilities below the hotel, these were 10 euros per day,. We booked a room overlooking the Ramblas and were glad we did, as the views were amazing. I have heard some reports about the hotel but In our opinion it did exactly what it said on the tin, it gave you a great base to explore Barca, in very comfortable surroundings. A+ Would definately go back again

<Content>Good hotel in an excellent location We stayed at the Royal for 2 nights and enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a fantastic location, right on the Ramblas. We had a superior room overlooking Las Ramblas and it was great to be able to see what was going on when we were in our room. As we had booked a superior room we hoped it would be larger, we felt it was fairly cramped for a superior room. A slight gripe is that the furniture is across the window and it is difficult to get access to what is one of the best points of the room (the view) we got round this by moving the furniture around.The rooms are very well insultated from outside noise so that is not a problem.The breakfast is nice and the breakfastroom is spacious and with the view over the Ramblas a very nice place ot eat in the morning. We were told that there was no restaurant in the evening, however, on passing the hotel during tour last evening it did appear that the restaruant served food in the evenings, so perhaps worth investigating.The staff at the Royal are very attentive and I would most likely stay here again.

<Content>Good hotel, great location My family (two adults and a 15-year old child) had a very brief stay at the Royal (arrived at midnight and left the next day). The hotel was fine (like a US Holiday Inn), but definitely not luxurious. Our room had three twin beds (the third bed was made up like a day bed) which worked well for us. The room was quite and average in size. The bathroom was a bit cramped. The hotel's location is excellent and the staff held our luggage well past check out. We took the aerobus to Placa Catalunya as another reviewer suggested. That worked well (definitely a great deal at about 4 Euros/person), but keep the following in mind. It looks like the bus is used by locals ( we were the only tourists and no one else spoke English). The bus was packed - lots of standing passangers. We arrived at Catalunya at midnight and although the hotel was only about a five minute walk, making our way through Las Ramblas (lots of people at outside bars) with luggage didn't feel very comfortable. From what I could understand, the bus driver tried to advise us to hide our money (I think ;-). We considered taking the bus to the airport the next day, but it looked like there was a long line.

Our room was comfortable and quiet and located at the back of the hotel.The staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly looking after our bags after official check out, and directing us to several place that we had chosen from the guide book.Thoroughly recomend and will definitely return.

<Content>Good Hotel. Great Location My wife and I have just returned from a weekend break at this hotel. The location is great. Step out through the hotel entrance and you are right in the centre of this energetic and stylish city. Step back though the door to escape the same! We booked a Superior Design Ramblas View room. These are on their own Royal floor. They are modern and stylish, but the room we had was small. There was no separate bath tub, but the shower room was excellent. Overall for our short stay we were happy with our room. Noise insulation from the bustle of Las Ramblas was very good, which had the downside of making the internal noise of the hotel more noticable on ocassion. On the Royal floor is a small lounge area of a few tables and chairs with some complimentary Cava, Tea, and Mineral Water. We enjoyed a glass, or two, of Cava before we went out for the evening. We had breakfast in the Hotel, which unsurprisingly is more expensive than you can find at local cafes. The breakfast room over looking Las Ramblas was pleasant, and the buffet breakfast offered a good choice. The staff were polite, professional, and very helpful. When we return to Barcelona we will stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Royal welcome Getting to the hotel by rail is quite easy (try to travel light)from Sants catch the L3 Metro to Liceu or Catalunya stations.The reception is clean and welcoming with exceptionally polite and helpful staff.Despite the location the rooms fronting La Ramblas are well insulated from the hustle and bustle outside.The bedrooms and en suite bathrooms are clean, comfortable and nicely decorated.A bit pricey in season but if we were to go to Barc again, we would endeavor to stay at the Royal, as we have twice before.Far better experience than staying at the Expo near Sants.Usually eat breakfast out of the hotel, so can't comment on their first meal of the day.

<Content>Clean, comfortable and centrally located Summary:If you are in Barcelona for a few days and want clean comfortable centrally located lodgings, then the Hotel Royal is perfect.When and why we stayed:My wife, son and I stayed at the Hotel Royal for 2 nights in March 2006. We were in the city as my son and I had tickets for the Barcelona versus Deportivo football match (Barca won 3:2). Cost:We booked the hotel with flights and match tickets from expedia. Room:The room and furnishing were old but most importantly clean and quiet. The beds were very comfortable and we all slept well. The bathroom was spacious with a combined bathtub and shower. The room also had a TV and table  chairs. There was also a minibar but we didn鈥檛 use it as the supermarket nearby (turn right out of the hotel鈥檚 front door then walk for a minute) was much cheaper for water (鈧?.30 for 1.5 litres) and beer (San Miguel 鈧?.60 for half a litre). There is a free to use safe in the wardrobe. As we booked a triple room we were unable to obtain a room with a La Rambla view 鈥?these are doubles. The Hotel: The staff are friendly and when we when requested help to access our safe we received prompt assistance. We didn鈥檛 eat the hotel鈥檚 鈧?3 breakfast as there are much cheaper options nearby. La Nurnia (turn left out of the hotel鈥檚 front door then walk for 2 minutes towards Placa Catalunya and the restaurant is on the left) was very good and served reasonably priced set menus. Location: Perfect. The hotel is at the top of La Rambla, near Placa Catalunya, which is a major transport hub with a Metro and railway station as well as stops for buses. There are dozens of restaurants and bars nearby. The 9th floor caf茅/restaurant in the El Cortes Ingles department store in Placa Catalunya is a marvellous spot to chill out over a coffee whilst you admire the magnificent city panorama there is a Starbucks near the hotel, at Ramblas 109. The Jules Verne bar a few doors away (towards Placa Catalunya) shows live English and Spanish football.The city:Barcelona is one of the great cities of the world. It is: cosmopolitan; alive; happening and radical. There鈥檚 lots to see and do. A visit to the Camp Nou is a must. Our visit for a match was memorable 鈥?a tremendous spectacle with outstanding exciting football played. If there isn鈥檛 a match on you can tour the stadium and visit the club鈥檚 museum. The Bus Tur铆stic is a great way to see the city鈥檚 main sites if you are short of time. The Tourist Bus has 44 stops along three routes: Northern Route (red), Southern Route (blue)  Forum Route (green) You can get on and off as many times as you like along the journey. The nearest stops to the hotel are in. Placa Catalunya A one-day ticket costs 鈧?8 or 鈧?2 for two days. Feel free to E-mail me if you require further information.

<Content>Good Value Location could not be bettered for tourists looking to explore Barcelona. I had a standard room which was roomy, bright, comfortable and clean. Breakfast room and food were good and the staff were very profressional. Comically what is referred to the Cafe Royal Bar is simply a vending machine dispensing bottles of wine, beer and cups of coffee.All in all a fine Hotel that's easy to recommend.

<Content>Fabulous Location The hotel is situated right on La Rambla on the doorstep of the Metro system.We had booked one of the recently rennovated Designer Rooms on the Royal floor, it was well worth it. The standard of the room was excellent and the added touch of being able to use the facilities within the Royal Lounge was nice, excellent Cava!

<Content>super hotel great location. great staff. we had superior rooms overlooking the ramblas. booked direct with the hotel who emailed the booking confirmation price etc so no probs when it came to check out. a really great location at the top of the ramblas. read one review about having breakfast at the nuria resturaunt, its great 6 euros compared with 13 euros plus tax at the hotel. out of the hotel turn left about a minute walk brings you to the nuria. if you come out of the hotel go to the end of the buliding and turn left down the narrow street two good resturaunts there on the right hand side. definatley stay at the hotel royal again. take the city tour for two days 18euros one day 22 euros two days. you need two days to get round it all.

<Content>Good hotel, excellent location Stayed at the Royal in late January. The hotel location is excellent, with amazing views of las Ramblas, yet totally soundproofed rooms. The rooms are spotless, breakfast is good and the staff are helpful. Can't really fault it!

<Content>A Great La Ramblas View I was there on the Week of Nov 14, 2005. I did my reservation over the Internet and got confimrations by email. I changed my reservations a couple of times, called the staff each time, and they did it with no problem. Great thing about thoe hotel is the lcoation viewing the Ramblas. But don't worry about noise as the double glass window will make your stay as soundproof as possible. Resturant food variety is not much but it also views the Ramblas so you can enjoy eating and watching, but then who would think of eating in the hotel with all of the restuarants around you. Staff is very friendly and they help in finding the right places for food an shopping. Last, when I returned home, they sent me a Thank You letter. Next time I go to Barcelona, Hotel Royal will be on top my list.

<Content>The Place To Stay! We arrived at Hotel Royal on 3rd Jan for a 2 night stay. We used the Aerobus to transfer from the airport at a cost of 3.60 euros each and the journey taking approx 40mins. You arrive at Cattayula Square right at the top of The Ramblas and you can see the hotel from there. We arrived at 11.20am and were allocated our room straightaway which had a great view of The Ramblas with all the street entertainers and stalls running right down to the harbour. This is a prime location so well worth paying slightly more. Hotel was as described 4*, spotlessly clean, beautiful bathroom with all toiletries provided, very comfortable beds and there was no problem with noise as the room/windows were well soundproofed. We never sampled breakfast there as 13 euros each but there were plenty of bars/cafes nearby for 1/2 price plus a spar/supermarket a few doors away. Would definately return here as Excellent Service and Location......

<Content>Nice Hotel, Good Location Stayed in this hotel for three nights with some friends. Had decided to go for one of the more expensive rooms as a treat but we ended up in room 1 which I think was one of the smallest rooms in the hotel despite the price! Having said that the room was very stylish and the shower was excellent. Great view on to the Ramblas and the quadruple glazing did the job in terms of keeping the noise out at night.You're very much paying a premium for the location of the hotel - right at the top of Las Ramblas but it does the job in terms of good beds, good security and good showers, but you don't get a great deal of bang for your buck. Be warned as well - keep hold of your wallet at all times on the Ramblas (even at this end) and especially at night

<Content>4-Star DIY We spent our honeymoon at the hotel, a total of 8 nights over the New Year. Having stayed in Barcelona before, we expected the 4-star rating to be slightly lower quality than other European hotels, and Hotel Royal was no exception. The rooms are quite small and pricey, beds are hard, no gym or pool, and room service should be avoided. But the location is unbeatable. Situated close to Placa de Catalunya, the hotel is a short walk from an amazing variety of great restaurants, shops and sights - and only about a ten minute walk from the Marina. There's a supermarket virtually next door (good for cheap bottled water to stock up the mini-bar), an internet caf茅 two minutes round the corner (go out the hotel, take first left, then left again) and an amazing foccacceria called Buenas Migas that serves the best hot chocolate in town (go out the hotel and turn left down the side alley). There's also some great places on Passeig de Gracia (Tapelia as an example, it's beside the cinema on the left hand side). The list is endless - avoid the hotel's food, and don't dine on La Rambla, way too much money for gross food. The hotel is decent, and we found the triple-glazing to be effective, but the staff are not prone to being helpful, and the front desk does not display information on theatre, tours, etc. Housekeeping is great, but, honestly, avoid room service. The little caf茅s around the corner are much, much better!

<Content>Beautiful city We stayed in the Hotel Royal for New year. We were only there for three nights and thought the hotel was fabulous! We booked on Lastminute. We requested a double room and a view of La Ramblas, which is the main street the hotel is located on. All of our requests were satisfied and we had a magnificent view. The rooms have triple glazing so you cannot hear any of the noise from La Rambla. The location of the hotel is spot on! located at the top of La Rambla with a view of Placa de catalunya, the main square at the top of La Rambla. We were able to enjoy the atmosphere of the new year street party right from our hotel window so we were not caught in the 50,000 people who were on La Rambla that night!!The metro is a 30 second walk away from the hotel and everything is nearby, perfect location. The room was superb. It was spacious and very clean. A mini bar and electronic safe were provided. The safe was no extra charge which we found unusual.... The bathroom was huge! It had a huge bath and power shower and a huge marble sink. It was a very pleasant stay at the Hotel Royal due to the lovely rooms, easy access to Barcelona sights and the staff who were very welcoming. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who really wants to get out and about and see the sights of Barcelona, great value for money!Just be careful of pick pockets as they are everywhere especially where the street entertainers are performing... Do not eat Tapas on La Rambla or any food for that matter as it is extremely expensive and crap. There are many restaurants off La Rambla down the side streets but be careful in the evenings as the side streets seem quite sinister.... We can recommend a brilliant italian restuarant. It's called La locanda just around the corner from the cathedral, Dr.Joaquim pou is the street name. Best food we had all weekend and really good value for money. Genrally we found the Spanish food to be extremely bland and over priced! General summary, beautiful city, awful food!

<Content>Best hotel in Bcn I stayed in Royal with my husband 09-11 Dec. We were celebrating our second wedding anniversary and booked one of the new rooms of Hotel Royal called Design rooms. They are all overlooking Las Ramblas and they are only some EUR more expensive than the standard rooms but it is worthy because We could enjoy the life on the Ramblas through our window and the room was very comfortable and all new!!! Breakfast was super!!! We had breakfast overlooking Las Ramblas early in the morning whilst you watch people walking up and down (going to work). It is a real awakening of Barcelona!!! Although there is no bar at the lobby, you can pop in the restaurant next door (the hotel's restaurant called La Poma)which it is also a cafeteria. The vending machines at the lobby are also ok, they are in a very comfortable and quiet place to stay where you can have a beer at a cheap price after your excursions. We will never forget our stay in Barcelona and Hotel Royal made it even more special!!!

<Content>Very Dissapointed!! Do not stay here! My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights and were very dissapointed with this hotel. It is classed as a 4 star hotel and this is definatly not the case, the rooms are very basic, decoration is extremly dated and the rooms smelt damp. The fixtures and fittings inside the rooms were poorly maintained. The photos of Hotel Royal are very deceptive. The restaurant that the hotel recommend La Poma is awful, do not eat here! Although the hotel is situated in the heart of Las Ramblas, there are plently of very nice hotels situated here too! For the price of the hotel, I would have expected more. The rooms are NOT sound-proofed, although they do block out the noice of the street, they do not block out the noice from the rest of the hotel, as we were woken early every morning by other guests. You can hear everything your neighbours are doing! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, nor would I class it as a 4 star hotel!

<Content>One great place This is one great hotel and deserves a 4 star rating. For 105 euros (tax included) (December 1-4, 2005), it was a great deal. It is at a great location. The construction is very good and the double windows were effective in keeping the noise out. Open the windows and enjoy the Rambla from your room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely go back there again.Tip: Do not take the train from BCN. They have changed the schedule and it is confusing and inconvenient especially if you any luggage. Train from BCN is 2.30 euros. Take the Aerobus directly to Plaza Catalunya from BCN for only 3.60 euro.

<Content>best barcelona hotel I have stayed in Have been to Barcelona more than a dozen times now and have got to say this is the best hotel I have stayed in. The location is brilliant right on Las Ramblas within easy reach of everything and every where. Our room over looked Las Ramblas, the double glazing is superb we hardly heard a noise from outside. The room was big clean and tidy everything in it that we needed, a good maid service and a wonderful bed. The largest double bed I have encoutered in Spain and a proper bed not two singles pushed together and so comfy. Breakfast was included and what an experience to sit overlooking Las Ramblas watching the world go by. The food and choice was excellent.The staff were polite and helpful. The only downside is the bar/lounge area which is help yourself from a vending machine and although clean and tidy is very impersonal but we hardly spent any time there so this is nit picking. Overall a splendid hotel and one which I will stay in on my next visit.

<Content>can't wait to go back Stayed at this hotel a couple of weeks ago, the most comfortable bed to be slept in. The amenities could not be faulted, the dinner plate sized shower head provided the most invigorating massage that one could wish for after a day's walking/sightseeing. Not the most spacious of rooms we have stayed in but spotlessy clean and maid service excellent. We had a room with a view over La Ramblas, what entertainment!!, close the windows and no sound at all. The breakfasts were more than adequate for us. The staff we found very friendly and helpful. The situation of the hotel is perfect - you are within walking distance of so many tourist attractions, shops, restaurants and theatres. We will certainly be back at some time to visit Barcelona, staying at this hotel which is so close to all the important attractions that are available. Thank you Hotel Royal

<Content>location, location, location To be right in the heart of the action, you couldn't find a better bet. It was so easy to get anywhere- the tourist busses are close by, amazing (but touristy) restaurants, great shopping.HOWEVER...this is a noisy, bustling hotel. Do not stay in an interior courtyard room on a weekend- as all the windows face each other, and you can hear people partying (or whatever) until 3 or 4 in the morning. Also, the beds are like rocks (as most European hotels are) so be prepared to see your chiropractor!

<Content>Fabulous location, excellent hotel i've just returned from a girls' weekend away. We were really impressed with the hotel from the outset - its location, cleanliness and courteous staff. There were 6 of us  luckily for us they gave us 2 rooms that had a connecting door, so we felt like we were all in the same room - brilliant. We'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The only down side to it was that there isn't much natural light in the rooms, nor is the lighting adequate. But hey ho - you don't go to Barcelona to stay in the hotel room do you!

<Content>Get room overlooking Las Ramblas We stayed for 2 nights this September before a cruise. They gave us a back facing room the first night, even though we had requested a Rambla facing room when we made reservations. It was very clean but small and dark, since it was overlooking another wall of the hotel. We were moved the next day and what a difference a front facing room made! It was larger and brighter with a wonderful view of La Rambla. The windows opened so we could see and hear some of the street artists, but when we closed the windows there was not a sound. The bathroom was all marble with very nice toiletries and hairdryer. All in all it was a very nice stay but the two rooms were not at all comparable so make sure you get a front facing one.The breakfast buffet was included in our room rate but I agree it was not worth the money. There were plenty of places to get breakfast on Las Ramblas.Watch your pockets because my husband had a failed pick-pocket attempt. He wrapped his neck pouch around his belt and kept the pouch in his front pocket so when one person poked his pants very low on one side the other guy tried to pull out the pouch on the other side. He couldn't get it fortunately but we learned that when people were following too closely we would stop and turn and make them pass us. Otherwise Las Ramblas is a circus- Street artists everywhere each very clever.

<Content>Great place to stay! Just got back from a 3 day stay at the Royal Hotel in Barcelona. I would highly recommend it! Terrific location right on La Rambla - close to everything and tons of restaurants nearby. The rooms are huge, big bathrooms - everything is clean and quiet. The staff is helpful and attentive - and they spoke English. They even have a parking ramp nearby.Almost all of the main sights are within walking distance. We didn't end up taking the metro/subway, but the stations are very close to the hotel. We walked to the beach, the Barri Gothic, the Guadi houses and the several museums.

<Content>Wonderful Hoyel My two sisters and I along with our husbands went on a cruise in July 2005 so we deceided to stay the night before at the Hotel Royal in Barcelona.We were impresed by the friendliness of the Front Desk Staff. We were given rooms as soon as we arrived. (After 10 hours of flying from the USA and running through airports in France).Our rooms were on the 6th floor facing the famous Las Ramblas. The rooms were spacious and the most important thing for us, in a Non Smoking floor. The bathrooms were inmaculate clean. The entire facilities were inmaculate and the beds very confortable.At night, we were serenated by a guy playing the flute in front of my window but the music was very good. The rooms are sound proof so it did not bother me much. The next day we went to the hot and cold buffet breakfast which was very good. I had the best chocolate milk in years!.The Hotel Staff made arrangements to have a van pick up us at the Airport and on the next morning to tour around the City of Barcelona and to take us to the pier to go on our cruise ship. ( This went on without a hitch in spite of the fact that we were six adults with tons of luggage).This is an excellent hotel (4 stars) which I would highly recommend to anybody. I would be looking forward to stay there again in my future trips to Barcelona.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Royal for 2 nights and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel! The room was very clean and spacious. Our room over looked Las Ramblas but we werent kept up by noise at all. In fact, it was nice to be ableto open the windows at night and look and hear what is going on on the street, then you close the windows and you cant hear a thing. Location can't be beat. Very easy access to the airport by bus. Close to many subway entrances, and located right on Las Ramblas.I would stay at Hotel Royal again.

<Content>crowded barcelona stayed at this hotel 8th - 13th sep 2005 .hotel in superb position quite room at back of hotel with double glazing.rooms very clean didn't eat here because of high cost of breakfast - 13 euros.breakfast could be taken in bars on ramblas for 4- 8 euros.I would also recommend using the underground to visit tourist sites instead of the tourist bus as traffic in barcelona is horrendous and if using the tourist bus all your time is spent in traffic jams

<Content>Lovely hotel Set on the Ramblas - an extremely clean and lovely hotel. We were on the 4th floor directly overlooking the main street, and even though it's busy there constantly, the windows were double glazed and hardly any noise got through. The hotel is in the perfect place. The harbour is just down the road with a lovely shopping centre, the beach is within walking distance and all the tapas bars and the Hard Rock Cafe are just yards away. Take the tourist bus for a good day out - getting on and off where you like. The frequency of these buses is around every 5 minutes so not much hanging around. We ate breakfast in the hotel every morning. The hours are 7-11 a.m. and its a buffet so you can just help yourself and the selection is really good. Lots of other tourists use La Poma (the restaurant that belongs to the hotel) as well - it was always full. We were warned about pickpockets before we went but we didn't see any trouble at all and there was a police presence around which made us feel safe. The only thing I would warn about are gypsy women with babies that are begging constantly. You just have to have common sense and don't wander off down any narrow alleyways (keep to the main areas).I would definitely go back to the hotel and we had a very enjoyable stay there.

<Content>Brilliant Location Located at the top of the Ramblas near the square, so really handy for getting the bus from the airport and not having to walk far once you arrive. Hotel was very clean and our room was big, although we did have a room that looked into the middle of the hotel so no view, next time I would ask for a room overlooking the Ramblas as the windows are triple glazed and I'm sure you wouldn't hear anything from the street.You can walk everywhere which is great, but take good walking shoes as there is so much to see and do on your doorstep!Found a lovely restaurent opposite called 'Attic' which was really good food and good priced.Do not have breakfast in the hotel, it is one price of about 拢10 per person and all I could eat was 3 slices of toast! There are loads of places to get food, so not to worry.Would stay in this hotel again.

<Content>perfect location My husband and I have just returned fron the Hotel Royal with our 10 year old son. We would highly recommend it as it is located right on La Rambla! Our room overlooked La Rambla which was buzing all day and night but as there was triple glazing in the room noise was never a problem. Only thing to mention is that we booked a standard room (the offer was that child under 12 goes free)-however it means we all had to share a kingsize bed-if we wanted another bed it was another 206 Euro!. The bed however was enormous and it was not a problem. Fully air conditioned spotlessly clean and a safety box in the room. We would definately stay again (one other point , when going to airport on your return home dont get hotel to book taxi -we were charged double compared with our arrival-taxis are plentiful accross the road).

<Content>stag parties galore! Great location, but dark dingy rooms. We stayed here over a weekend, and the hotel was full of stag and hen parties from the UK. We had a couple of groups in the rooms next to us, and were woken every night between 3 and 5am with people banging doors down to get into rooms, mistakenly banging on our door, and the sound of someone vomiting in the next door toilet. No need to worry about the noise on Las Ramblas, as the noise inside will certainly keep you awake!

<Content>Great location My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Royal for three nights before our cruise. Contrary to a couple negative reports, we found the hotel clean, comfortable, and the staff was very friendly. The hotel is located about half a block from Placa Catalunya right on La Rambla. Our room overlooked La Rambla and although there was still activity on it at 4 AM there was no noise in our room since the windows have double pane glass. One thing I have found out. is that most European hotels do not provide wash cloths since it is a very personal item. Would recommend that you pack a couple of disposable ones if you plan to stay there.In addition to the tour of Monserratt and the city,we had a fabulous time just walking La Rambla sampling the food and watching the mimes. They are fabulous. If I ever return to Barcelona, I would definitely stay at this hotel again again.

<Content>Excellent Location I stayed here from 19 - 22 June with my daughter the hotel is in an excellent location right in the centre of the Ramblas. The Royal is very comfortable and clean - ask for a room overlooking The Ramblas you will not suffer from the noise outside as all the rooms are triple glazed to prevent this. Hotel staff very helpful, breakfast very pricey for the content but convenient nevertheless. Don't eat in La Poma - very mediocre surroundings and food to match. Only downside was the lack of any sizeable publice area e.g. bar and public loos (you have to use the ones next door in their restaurant). Definitely will use this hotel again.

<Content>Such a bad experience, never again... I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, the staff is unhelpful and rude, the rates are overpriced and the rooms are like a youth hostel. I was very disappointed at the fact that this hotel was rated and priced like a 4 star hotel when it was in fact really a 2 star hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Stay! This is a very nice hotel situated right on Las Ramblas, perfect place to stay. I went with another 2 girls and we shared a double room with a roll away bed, we found it too be ample space and we were on the 5th floor facing Las Ramblas. With the windows closed you cannot hear any noise and with it open the atomosphere of the street just comes straight into the room. The room was very clean, the bathroom was very nice, the only thing missing was music and a kettle!! The hotel staff were very friendly and allowed us to extend our room stay till 7.30pm for an extra 60 euros, which was fantastic! All the shops, bars, cafes, resturants are close by and all the shops are open on a Sunday, so don't just shop on a Saturday as you have the Sunday as well. Overall this hotel was an excellant find and we are all planning to return to the same hotel in the future.

<Content>Excellent Value This hotel is listed as 4* and deserves that classification in almost every respect. The rooms look a little old-fashioned to be sure. However, our room was large and comfortable, the service swift, freindly and helpful and the location outstanding - you couldn't want a better position for a base for exploring barcelona.The only major downside is the lack of facilities - no pool, spa, not even tea  coffee making facilities in the room.The best thing of all is that you get all this for a price bracket more befitting a 3* hotel, which this certainly isn't! I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who isn't on the tightest of budgets.

<Content>Great Hotel - highly recommend We stayed at the Royal Hotel for 4 nights in May to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary. We booked the Royal after reading the reviews on this website. We were not disappointed. The staff are extremely helpful. Our room was on the sixth floor overlooking La Rambas. It was a lovely room with a beautiful en suite bathroom. Breakfast was included in the price we paid though we would not choose to eat there had it not been included as we did not think it was value for money. Also the breakfast room was quite small. On the whole though we had a fabulous time. The hotel location is ideal for touring Barcelona on foot, by bus or metro.

<Content>Do not stay here My husband and I stayed at a few hotels in Barcelona in May 2005, and we were extremely disappointed with the Royal Hotel. It is listed as a four-star hotel, and this is absolutely not the case. The room we got was VERY small (I would estimate 10 x 10 feet maximum) and the hotel looks like it hasn't been renovated in years. There was no view from our room (we looked onto a white wall that was about 5 feet away from our window), the room was musty and dark and the decor is very old and dank. The hotel is well-located in the heart of La Rambla, but this did not compensate for the poor upkeep and style of the hotel. The hotel lobby and reception desk are fine (although the photos make them look nicer than they actually are), but once you head up to your room, it is all downhill. I would strongly recommend finding another hotel in Barcelona because there are many with better value and better cleanliness.I would not even recommend this hotel to budget travellers or students, since it is relatively expensive. The only people that should stay here are people who only care about location and really want to be in the center of the city - you can walk almost anywhere from this hotel. Having said that, there are plenty of hotels in the neighborhood that may have nicer amenities at the same cost.

<Content>Great place to stay We stayed at the Royal Hotel on the Ramblas for five nights in June 2005. We had a non smoking room overlooking the Ramblas which had a great view but at the same time was quiet and cool because of the air conditioning and double glazing. The staff were helpful and efficient. It is near the tube station and buses so sight seeing is easy as is access to the Gothic Quarter,Port Viell and the Ramblas. We had breakfast once in the hotel as it was not included in the price and at 13 Euros we felt it was a bit expensive and we preferred to eat up the road for 5 Euros. The room was comfortable and the marble bathroom very nice.

<Content>Family Friendly Stayed here for 2 nights beginning of May. Nothing was too much trouble. The night staff were particularly helpful. Twin room, with folding bed for our 3 year old. Room very nice, no noise problems - we were on 4th floor. First time used the tripadvisor and the Royal was one of the only hotels available (Grand Prix was on at the same time). It was exactly as the reviews had said. Would definitely recommend and go there again. So ideally placed to visit the Gothic area, lovely walk down to the port. Didn't eat breakfast there as there was so many places to eat. On the whole the city is very reasonable and spent our time popping into tapas bars. No wonder they don't eat until 10pm + . Our flight wasn't until very late at night and the hotel held onto our luggage and were delighted to do so! Excellent customer service. Go enjoy.

<Content>Nice Clean Hotel in a Great Location! The location of this hotel is optimal for touring around Barcelona. You can walk the Ramblas at night and be close to home, jump on the metro at any time (its only a block away). The bathrooms are clean and well stocked with anything you could need including a toothbrush and toothpaste, razor, soaps, creams, shampoo, etc. The rooms are plenty large and the double paned windows are a blessing when PC Barcelona (football) won their championship game and the festivities took to the Ramblas for the entire night! Our room faced the Ramblas and although we could still hear the fireworks and M-80's being lit off, with my ear plugs, I still got some sleep.They have a wonderful lobby, great doormen, good service and very very clean facilities. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.On the negative side (there always is one), they make you sign an agreement when you use a charge card to accept their conversion rate. Our 88E dinner in their adjoining restaurant turned into $250 US. That seemed like a bit much. But you're pretty much stuck when it comes to their credit card policy. My advice: stick to cash and travelers cheques. There is a cash machine right across the Ramblas from the hotel that you can use. In addition, the thermostat in our room never seemed to work correctly. We wanted it cooler and it wouldn't go below 25C no matter how low we set it.There is a great grocery store a few doors down the street. Don't miss the downstairs in the grocery store: 3.3 Euros for a litre of Sangria, .5 Euro for a baquette, 2 Euro for some cheese and .20 Euro for desserts. Great deals for a quick dinner in your room while watching the people on the Ramblas! Also the open air fruit and vegetable marquet (Boqueria?) down the street a bit was a great place to shop as well.

<Content>Great Hotel, Highly Recommended ! Myself, my Wife, and my Mom  Dad stayed here a few weeks ago for three nights in order we could explore the great City of Barcelona. We used the reviews on this site whilst browsing which hotel to book, so thought the least we could do was to do a quick review of our own!We found the hotel to be exceptionally clean, in fact one of the cleanest hotels we've ever stayed in. The staff were friendly and the room service and the maid service were faultless at all times. Contrary to what has been mentioned on a couple of other reviews, the bar is fine, clean, tidy and modern, with reasonable prices although it was quite small.We stayed in two rooms, both overlooking the Ramblas on the 5th and 6th floor, and had barely any noise from the streets below. The aircon worked a treat and the mini bar came in handy. One minor fault is that the lifts broke down on a couple of occasions which meant a bit of a walk to the upper floors, but it helped work the Tapas's off! We were lucky enough to see Barcelonas last league game of the season (incredible experience if you get the chance) and the hotel looked after and stored our tickets from the agency (Barcelona-football-tickets.) without any problems.So to summarise, all four of us can definitely recommend the hotel, and should we ever go back to Barcelona wouldn't hesitate to stay there.

<Content>Fantastic location Have just returned from a three night stay at this hotel and couldn't have picked a better location. Chose this hotel solely because of the reviews on this website which were 'spot-on'. On arrival asked for a room overlooking Las Ramblas which we were given, even though we didn't check in until approximately 7.00 p.m. Found the reception staff to be very helpful. Were given a room on the first floor which was perfect - were not disturbed at all by noise from the street below. Only point to make about noise were the pipes coming from the bathroom which seemed to rattle quite a bit during the night!! However, it didn't spoil our stay. Barcelona is a fantastic city and found the Bus Turistic fantastic value at 鈧?1 for a two day ticket. We weren't leaving for the airport until 5.00 p.m. but the hotel allowed us to store our suitcase in their luggage room after check-out at 12 noon. Definitely recommend this hotel - clean, friendly and fantastic location!!

<Content>clean friendly and excellent location after arriving at the airport we got the A1 bus from outside the airport straight into placa de catulyuna which costs 3.60 euro brilliant value its a stones throw from the hotel we priced a taxi and he wanted 25 euro so it is well worth getting . the hotel is a fantastic location just at the top of La Ramblas .We requested a view of La Ramblas which we got there is double glaze on the windows so you get a great nights sleep. The rooms were cleaned every day the staff we very friendly ,the bar was small but had a nice atmosphere . All and all the hotel was a pleasure to stay in i would highly recommend a stay there .

<Content>Excellent Position, Spotlessly Clean My sisters and I have just returned from spending 3 nights in the Hotel Royal. Reviews on this site had recommeded requesting a room at the front but when we did so, we were informed that all triple rooms were at the back. However, the room was very spacious, comfortable and clean, and being on the fourth floor was quiet enough that we could have our window open all night.The hotel is in a fantastic position, and it was easy for us to pop in and out during the day to deposit bags of shopping and freshen up!The best place to have breakfast is at the Nuria Restaurant which is just a few doors up the Ramblas, next to Burger King. Just 6 euros for a full English breakfast.We would definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Excellent Choice Two 28 year old girls stayed here for three nights in April 2005 and found the hotel to be in an excellent location. The rooms could not have been better, very clean, spacious and with a nice bathroom. We asked for a room overlooking La Ramblas and got one on the sixth floor which was sound proofed and had a great view.The staff were friendly and I would definately stay at this hotel if I was going back to Barcelona.

<Content>Satisfactory Hotel .Watch the pickpockets Very helpful on reception desk. Negotiated a better deal by phoning them instesd of using the website. Booked 3 rooms which were all ready when we arrived at lunchtime. Very clean and smart. Bathrooms nice and clean with marble. fridge in room and there is a cheap supermarket next door so dont bother bringing drinks etc. if you have a Ramblas facing room insist to be on the 6th floor or you will hear the noise. Ramblas busy even at four in the morning so be warned.Dont book breakfast. Awful and expensive. The cafe up the strret near burger king did great breakfasts for 6 euros ( the whole works). Much less busy and relaxing. Watch the pickpockets. Mother had bag stolen from harbour area. They are on bikes and rollerblades and are like grease lightening. They take from your knee if sitting down so be paranoid or it could be you. There is a Safe in hotel roomso dont take passsports etc with you. Hotel is at the very top of the Ramblas so good for shopping but not so good for the harbour. Avoid restaurants on Ramblas. Head for gothic area. 4 cats was very nice but busy. Ask for a table upstairs if there are only 2 of you. Worth going to. Cable cars a long walk to get to. Taxis much cheaper if you just get one outside airport. Would recommend the hotel as it was so clean. Not a romantic city. More of a party place with lots of English coming in from cheap flights ( saw loads of hen groups and stag groups)

<Content>Great Location We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Royal. The location of this hotel could not be better, near the top of La Ramblas and only a minutes walk to Placa de Catalunya. Port Vell is at the other end of La Ramblas and is about 15 minutes walk, although this will usually take longer as there is so much happening on La Ramblas. When we arrived we got the Airport bus A1 from the Airport to Placa de Catalunya. The hotel is only a minute or two's easy walk even with luggage and children. The open topped tour bus's also go from Placa de Catalunya.When we checked in I asked for a room at the front overlooking La Ramblas, the hotel staff happily arranged this. The room was clean and spacious and had a great view of over La Ramblas. The soundproofing ensured a good nights sleep.The mini bar in the room was well stocked but expensive, I would have prefered tea and coffee making facilities.Breakfast is 13 euro, but the choice was good, and is a great place to enjoy a leisurely breakfast if you enjoy people watching. The hotel has a small bar area, which did lack atmosphere, but was a good place to relax after a long days siteseeing/shopping.Overall the localtion of this hotel is excellent, the service good and the hotel rates are reasonable. I would definately stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Ideally situated on La Rambla Stayed at the Royal Hotel, Barcelona for 3 nights April 2005. Great mid priced hotel right at the top of La Rambla near Catalunya Square. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Room very clean and good sized - ask for a room with a view of La Rambla - worth it. Not too noisy considering where hotel is situated. Our internet deal included hot/cold buffet breakfast which was very nice. No complaints about the food at all. Hotel ideally situated for walks down to the harbour and right next door to the Metro. Found the Metro easy to use, very clean and friendly people who were more than happy to help you. Found all local transport efficient and easy to use. Would recommend the open top bus tour - hop on and off all you like. Great way to see the city sights. Amazing city - will return.

<Content>Fantastic Location! 26 March 05. Very good location, a stone's throw form Cataluna Sqaure, where the bus form the airport drops you off (A1, roughly 3.5 euros). Def. ask for a top floor room (these are all no smoking rooms), as this affords you a good nights sleep in a city that never sleeps! Clean, nice rooms, very large, spacious accomadation, this really is a geniune four star hotel. Great, loved this hotel.

<Content>friendly clean and great location but get a room at the front Very clean, great location and very helpful, friendly staff.Our room overlooking Ramblas large and sunny with good sound proofing. Our parents room at the back of the hotel, small and dark with no view at all except a dark courtyard (however staff would have been happy to change this) make sure you book a room with a view (although we did request this and didnt get it anyway).Breakfast not worth the money.Not great on atmosphere/ambience.But no real problems and would consider staying here again as long as it was in one of the front rooms.

<Content>Underwhelming Stayed at the hotel Royal in Feb.The location is fine but the hotel is just ok.The staff were civil but not at all helpful.The halls and lobby are very dark and while the hotel is very clean it has a dreary quality about it. Lots of british soccer fans were staying there when I was there (Chelsea vs Barca) which was fun, but I would not stay there again.

<Content>Location was best feature Initial impressions of this hotel were that it looked very modern in the middle of much older more beautiful buildings and inside it was a fairly standard, characterless affair. There is a bit of a bar at the back of the entrance lobbyand the check -in desk is to the left. We found the staff to be courteous and helpful and we were very lucky with our room - on the fourth floor overlooking the Ramblas which was a great source of entertainment. The room was very comfortable with every modern convenience (except perhaps, tea-making facilities) and we really appreciated the double-glazed windows and the thermostaticlly-controlled heating as it was quite cold when we were there in February. The en-suite was small but adequate. The one complaint we had about the room was that the walls were very thin and we could plainly hear our neighbours talking and moving about their rooms. The breakfast room was not very attractive and the breakfast itself was mediocre for the price of 13 Euros - better to go into one of the many cafes nearby.The location of this hotel could not be beaten with all the beauty and vibrancy of this great city on the doorstep and for this reason we would recommend it to friends and would stay there again ourselves.

<Content>Great Location Ditto the last 2 reviews. Great location and very clean. We got a deal via Hotels which was far better than the hotel were offering direct. Asked for on arrival, and got, a room overlooking Las Ramblas. Also got an Emperor sized bed which was very comfortable. This hotel is central for everything and the transport of the city i.e Metro, Aerobus (from airport) and tour buses is well organised and relatively inexpensive.Fab city, but watch for the pickpockets. Also eat and drink off the Ramblas since prices are much greater and can come as a surprise when you get the bill. They will always give you the largest possible measure of everything and charge more, so if you want a small beer, say so !!Overall we had a great 5 days.PS if you watch Barca, purchase the tickets from the ground when you arrive NOT on the internet where prices are DOUBLE!! We got prime tickets for 拢36.

<Content>Its all about the location! Just got back from a fantastic weekend in barcelona. First of all you just will not get a better located hotel in barcelona. Its about 100 yards from the Placa de catalunya and right on the famous Ramblas.If you are coming from the airport dont waste your money on a taxi. Get the airport bus for 鈧?.60 and it will drop you within a 2 minute walk to your hotel.You are within walking distance to the beautiful and lively marina. Not only that the hop on hop off tourist bus is again located just a minute away.And so to the hotel. Just make sure you request a room overlooking the Ramblas. It will make all the difference. This is not a 4 star by irish standards. Maybe only an average 3 star. The staff are friendly and the hotel is clean. The room was small and unfortunetly for some strange reason we got two single beds pushed together in our double room which made things a bit uncomfortable. I'm not sure if this is the case in every room.One important factor is that the walls are paper thin and you can hear virtually everything in your neighbours room.The Ramblas is heaving from morning to night but when the windows are closed you cant hear a thing (except your neighbours). Watch out for those windows as they open fully and have a low ledge!The hotel has a small bar hidden away in the lobby area. Its not very comfortable and a bit stuffy. Best to do any drinking in the cafes nearby.Having said all that the location by far outweighs these drawbacks and I would recommend this hotel to anyone on that basis alone and thats why I will give it an above average rating.One last thing Barcelona is the most stunning city I have ever seen. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>Central and well looked after We stayed in Barcelona for 3 nights in Hotel Royal. It is cituated in La Rambla which is the most touristy area of the city. Also close to the metro and buses and I would say an ideal location. We had a room on the fifth floor looking at the back. No view at all. Just facing a wall. Not nice but we had booked via Expedia.com and the price was on offer. The good thing was that it was quiet. Breakfast was not included in the price. The room was good and very clean. Good facilities and well looked after. The attidude of the staff was neutral. Not very friendly or helpful but not rude. Overall good experience and probably I would recommend it because of it's location.

<Content>A Good Bet Got a good deal on the net and spent 4 nights here last week. Had a room on the 6th floor looking out over the ramblas but no problems with noise - 2 thick windows and 3 sets of curtains kept it nice and quiet.Clean bedrooms made up several times a day! Very helpful staffAll in all a great hotel in a great location - didn't give it the full five stars as the restaurant belonging to the hotel is very average. Otherwise no problems at all

<Content>A great, central hotel Hotel Royal is right on La Rambla, which, while touristy, is extremely central and a great place to stay. It was perfect for first-time visitors and allowed us to get our bearings. We stayed here for five days in January and I would recommend it to anyone. The rooms were nice and clean, and I cannot say enough about the hotel staff. They spoke English and were very helpful, always answering our questions and offering suggestions. If you can, try to get a room overlooking La Rambla. You don't have to worry about the noise (soundproof rooms), and it is so much fun to look out the window and see Barcelona life below. You will not be disappointed with this hotel.

<Content>great location; variable rooms A small group of friends (3 doubles and 1 sgl) stayed at the Royal 30 Dec-04 Jan.The travel agent got us a great rate (110 Euros for 4 nts, 88 for the last). Location is great ! The rooms thay gave us with double beds were VERY,VERY small. I would compare it to a suite on a cruise ship. The bathroom could not fit 2 people at the same time. We were told that because of the rate, and the time, that was all which was available to us.I sort of understand. We were able to change for the last 2 nts to a normal sized room which was fine. All rooms have a safe and a mini bar/fridge. Very friendly staff. Housekeeping was good. Their buffet breakfast is 13 Euros. I chose to go to a coffee shop next to the Dunkin Donuts for a coffee and pastery for E 1.60, and get a yogurt and some kiwi at the supermarket. This was sufficient for my wife and myself. I would reccommend this hotel but ask about the room.

<Content>The Royal Hotel Barcelon. Absolutely Fantastic We have just arrived back from a 4 night stay 28 December. The Hotel was in a fantastic position for all the sights and shopping. The atmosphere on Las Ramblas was worth every penny for the Hotel. The rooms were very clean and well decorated and comfortable. It was the best bathroom facilities I have ever seen. Modern and very clean (no black mould). We would most certainly stay there again. Staff were helpful and polite.

<Content>It was ok I stayed at the Royal Hotel in January of 2004 for New Years. The hotel overall was pretty good. However, not a whole lot of space if your staying with 3 people. It would have been adequate for 2 however. The staff wasn't too friendly when I requested two beds since we had 3 in the room. I checked into the hotel pretty early in the day and for one reason or another they wouldn't fulfill this request and would not give me a reason (maybe because I booked a cheap room rate online and rates can be high in the Ramblas area). Regardless the hotel was not bad and had a pretty good location if u want to be in the Ramblas. If you want to save a little money (on hotels and restuarants) I would recommend staying just a little off the Ramblas.

<Content>Great Location I chose this hotel based on reviews from this website and couldn't have been more pleased. It has a great location - right on the Ramblas and close to everything. The rooms are a good size, clean and sound-proof (just opening the window a fraction will show you how important this is!) and they provided me with a room overlooking the Ramblas as requested when i booked.

<Content>Good choice Hotel Royal was a pleasant surprise on arrival in Barcelona. Located right on Las Ramblas it was ever entertaining right outside our window and not noisy with the window shut. Huge rooms, clean and modern bathroom, good amenities, supermarket a few doors away, fantastic local food market a few more steps away, metro close by. The only thing to complain about was the breakfast, it was ok and nearly good but not quite. You really had to pick and choose a bit. I would recommmend this hotel. Watch your wallet on Las Ramblas.

<Content>Nice Hotel We had a lot of trouble selecting a hotel for our stay in Barcelona in early October. After reading the tripadvisor reviews and looking at the hotel website, we finally selected Hotel Royal for it's location and price. Got a room for 135 euros per night through our travel agent. Worth the money given its location. Staff were very friendly, and the room and bathroom were large, clean and quiet. It was easy to get to from the airport, catching the A1 bus to the Plaza. Being right on La Rambla added a nice atmosphere to our stay, and we were in easy walking distance to several sites, and close to the metro and bus for those sites further afield. We would stay here again.

<Content>Very Good Stay October 2004. Just returned from four days in Barcelona - 3 nights at the Royal Hotel. Best thing about the Royal is its location - 50 metres down Las Ramblas from Cataluyna Square. Nice reception, friendly staff, good small bar (spirits expensive), clean rooms and bathrooms (carpets a bit 'tired'). Rooms air-conditioned and with a free in-room safe. We stayed on a room only basis - 4 people can eat breakfast out for the price of one hotel breakfast. I would recommend the Royal.

<Content>Perfect My Wife and I have just returned from a weekend break in Barcelona. We chose the Hotel based on the reviews of this site and we weren't disappointed. Right at the heart of Las Ramblas and 50 yrds from Placa da Catalunya it was ideally situated. Only 10mins walk from the Waterfront, 5 mins walk from the Cathedral and the Gothic area. If you prefer to take the Tube the station is only 2 mins away. The Hotel is very friendly, rooms are spacious and well set out. If you can get a room at the front of the Hotel - all the better. The double glazing drowns out all the noise of the main street and when you open up the windows in the morning you are engulfed with the bustling sound of life on Las Ramblas - street entertainers, traders etc.. No minus points, will definitely return again. I booked directly with the Hotel and got a deal I couldn't find anyone else to match.

<Content>Great location Just come back from a 5 day family trip. Hotel was great. Chosen purely on feedback from this site. Asked in advance for 2 adjacent rooms and a view of Las Ramblas (front of hotel) - delivered on both accounts. Location of hotel is superb - only 100 yds from Catalunya Sq. at the top of Las Ramblas and within walking distance of stacks of shops.Rooms were v clean and tidy and maid service efficient. Breakfast albeit in a smallish room caters for all tastes. If going back would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Why go anywhere else...excellent..excellent Stayed here October, '04 and am still congratulating myself for choosing this hotel. It has everything...wonderful, very well kept room . Noise reduction windows.. blackout curtains. We had a room overlooking La Rambla and were not bothered at all at any time despite all the fantastic goings-on right under our noses. Bathrooms are modern and immaculate. Staff exceedingly helpful. Why go elsewhere?

<Content>Just perfect! Myself and a friend stayed at the Hotel Royal between 25th Aug-29th Aug. We booked our accommodation based on the previous glowing reviews of Hotel Royal and I can gladly say that they were absolutely spot on!! EVERYTHING about this hotel is fantastic - the rates, location, staff, cleanliness etc - could not have been better! We fell in love with the city and will definitely be back very soon! We will book with Hotel Royal for sure!!

<Content>Very very happy We just returned from a two-night trip to Barcelona and stayed at this hotel. My criteria were a quiet and clean hotel with a comfortable bed on Las Ramblas. I chose the Royal solely on the basis of the reviews on this site and I must say they were very accurate and we were very happy. We were on the 4th floor, overlooking the Ramblas and when the double glazing was shut you couldn't hear a thing. The bed was a little too firm for my taste but I still slept well. The room was a decent size and very clean and the air conditioning was good. Staff were friendly. The only slight downside was that - as people have said - the walls were thin and door-banging could be a problem. However, I'm very aware of these things and they didn't cause me a major problem. I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>A FABULOUS FIND FOR A GREAT PRICE1 We loved this hotel! Clean, modern and intimate with the absolute PERFECT location, directly ON La Rambla. At the corner was Placa Cataluyna, with access to Bus Turistic, and through a narrow winding street was the Cathedral in the Barri Gotic district...which we stumbled upon in our explorations. La Rambla is alive with actors, mimes, dancers and human statues....but the double paned windows of the hotel prevent street noise from invading your rest.Front desk staff was friendly and helpful and all spoke English fluentlyTaxi from the airport cost 20 euros plus tip.Practice your Catalan-most people don't use Spanish or English in restaurants and shops!

<Content>O.K Not a 4 star by American standards. Great central location, but it麓s an older hotel with no real lobby and still uses old fashioned keys and has no addl locks, so may not be best for those worried about safety.The rooms are nice but extremely small for a 4 star. Also my room had an awful view, ask to be facing La Rambla!

<Content>Location! Location! Location! We stayed here in July 04, and wow, you simply cannot ask for a better-placed Hotel, bang where it鈥檚 happening! (on the infamous Ramblas). Bars/Restaurants a plenty, all within a stone's throw.We found the Hotel to be clean and tidy, with efficient, cooperative and friendly staff.The general quality of the rooms/hotel exceeded our expectations by far, given the rate we paid.The bedrooms are adequate in size, with AC, good size/quality clean Bathroom/WC, and a nice large walk in wardrobe with room safe, and Colour Sat TV. Tho some rooms don鈥檛 necessarily have a view, so ask for one at the front of the building (but this will be noisier if you leave the windows open).Breakfast buffet is good; help yourself as much as you want.The Reception staff were SO accommodating, and helped us out as we'd (a party of 8 guys on a stag) inadvertently booked Doubles rather than Twins, so on arrival we asked if they could change our booking, they said they were fully booked and that it would be very difficult to do this, however, they pulled out all the stops for us and within the hour had changed our rooms so that we all had beds to ourselves!I would thoroughly recommend staying at this hotel, and would undoubtedly stay again when visiting Barca.Not going to mention much about the Ramblas that hasn鈥檛 been said before, except to say, yup, believe the hype! It's a great place for young, old, single and couples, however put on your streetwise hat, because there are hustlers working the Ramblas and you could easily fall prey to pickpockets, 'street magic' hustlers and also, (late at night) the ladies of the night, so BEWARE!!

<Content>Great value right on Ramblas! You simply cannot get a better location than this ... right on Ramblas, just a few steps from Plaza Catalunya.The hotel is not 5-star, but the staff is extremely diligent and helpful, and the rooms are well-kept and clean, if a bit small. I wasn't lucky enough to get Ramblas view (got an ugly view of a neighboring rooftop), but it was still great value for the money. Rates are extremely reasonable too, don't know why this hotel doesn't charge more (not to give them any ideas!) The location itself is worth more than the price you pay, as there is always something interesting going on right outside the hotel doors.For those arriving on the metro, the hotel is on the right-hand side if you are facing Ramblas, the same side as Burger King, but a few yards further down.I would recommend this hotel highly!

<Content>The Perfect Stay in Barcelona My husband and I stayed at the Royal Hotel about a month ago and thought is was the ideal place to stay in Barcelona. We had just come from hot and somewhat cramped stays in London and Paris, so we found the air conditioning and spacious room a much needed luxury. The location on the Ramblas was ideal (right near the metro stop from the train station too) and the room was just wonderful. We highly reccomended this hotel to anyone.

<Content>a winner for sure! My husband and I spent 5 days there in May. A small hotel but clean and the room was attractive. They have a big breakfast included. This is right on the Rambles and we enjoyed looking out the window and watching all the activities. The staff was very helpful when we had to ship two large bags to London as we had too much baggage for the trains. We would definitly go back.

<Content>Fantastic This hotel has it all. We stayed for three nights and couldn't fault anything. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and tidy and was serviced every day. We did not have breakfast in the hotel but did have room service and this was not overpriced at all. The mini bar was also reasonably priced. The best thing about this hotel is that it is centrally situated at the start of Las Ramblas. A*. Will definately be returning here.
