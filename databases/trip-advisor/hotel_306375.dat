<Content>Very Nice Business/Tourist Hotel Liked our stay at the Miyako Tokyo. Service was very friendly, rooms clean, and they upgraded us to a better room for free when we checked in. The bus service to Meguro and Shinagawa stations is convenient and fast, and the neighborhood was safe and quiet.

<Content>Great hotel  i stayed here Sept 1 - Sept 6 2008 and it was a wonderful place to stay. The lobby was beautiful, and the staff extra helpful.I found the location ideal because it was within walking distance of 2 subway lines. Also the hotel bus runs every 15 mins to drop you off at either station. In the morning it runs a few special trips to a larger train station, I believe its the JR station, but since I was never up that early and I choose to use the aiport bus to get me back and forth to the airport I didn't go to that station. That station isn't very far either from the hotel so you can always just get a cab to it. There were always lots of cabs around too! The food was alright. I would recommend eating while you are out on the town. There are a lot of wonderful restaurants in Tokyo.The room was awesome! I got to stay on the club level which has been recently renovated. Typical heavenly bed, large flat screen t.v. good working desk, and great bathroom. Everything kept very clean. They also had a small refrigerator in the room.I will DEFINATELY stay here again.

<Content>Little out of the way Hotel was a little out of the way and taxi drivers seemed to struggle a little to find it which meant a decent walk to train station and back at night.Rooms themeselves where pretty large but a little dated in style, bathrooms too pretty dowdy expected more really with a sheraton!

<Content>Great value and staff I'll preface the value part in that I used a few of my Starwood reward points to snag a $45 per night rate. As others have pointed out the location is not in the middle of the action or main sight-seeing clusters. That said, the free shuttle to both Meguro and Shinagawa JR train stations is very convenient. There is a subway stop on the Tokyo Metro that is about a 5 minute walk away. We used all three transportation stations and were able to get to all sights with relative ease, so I wouldn't be too worried about the location. In fact, it's nice to return to an area that's NOT crowded and a bit more relaxed.The rooms were what you'd expect for this level of property with clean rooms, firm beds, etc. They also have those fancy Japanese bidet toilets I miss so much now that I'm back home. The staff at this hotel was excellent during my visit. From the time we arrived, during our stay and when we departed, the staff was very attentive to our needs. The one nit is the service in the California Cafe is a bit spotty in a very minor sense where food doesn't come all at once (not that late either).We split our visit to Japan (Tokyo-Kyoto-Tokyo) so we were able to leave one of our bags behind for storage and everything worked out great.I'd stay here again if I return to Tokyo.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Excellent Service, Not A Good Location Nice hotel with an impressive lobby. Style of lobby is contemporary.The building has a more personal touch than other business hotels in tokyo. Location is not top, not in the vicinity of any interesting sights. A free bus every 15 mins will take you to the closest subway station (10 mins ride)Stayed for 8 nights on floor 6. Rooms are spacious (not huge though). Very clean and well kept. Style of room is oldish although furniture , carpet, etc. are not tired. But if you like modern design, it's not your place. Bathroom is very very clean, but again old. And a bit sad looking. Bath/Shower is not adjustable, if you are tall, not even too tall, you wont be comfortable.Service in all aspect is top notch (a pleasure in Japan). Concierge will greatly help you with anything imaginable. Even room service is superb. A small room with 2 computers grants free internet access, busy at times.

<Content>the worst 4* experience in my life This was the worst 4* hotel stay in my life. The air conditioning system would not lower the temperature below +25. The windows were sealed and the humidity was such that a small pool of condensed water would appear each morning under the window pane.Complaints to hotel management did not help: they would send each time someone to repair AC with no effect at all.During the booking, I was told that the hotel was family friendly. In reality, they do not even admit children under 12 to hotel swimming pool.

<Content>Nice clean hotel with good service... OK location This is a nice clean renovated hotel but the location is not walking distance to any of the big sites or areas of Tokyo. The service is great and the price is great for Tokyo but you will need to take the subway/train to see the real sites of Tokyo. If you dont mind being in a quiet residential area then this hotel is for you. They have a bus to take you to train station or you can walk 5-7 mins to the subway station. At night there are not many options to eat in the area but if you want a good priced well serviced hotel then this place is for you. Keep in mind you need to take the subway or train all the time since Tokyo is so large... but if you stay in Shinjuku, Shibuya or Ginza there is a lot to see in walking distance. I would only stay here again because of the reasonable price and if I just wanted a place to rest at night.

<Content>More good than bad... I stayed in this hotel for one week for business.There is a direct bus from Narita for 3000 yen. If you are tired from your trip, it's nice not to have to haul luggage through the train stations (the alternate way to get here). You just walk 20 ft outside and hop on the charter-style bus and in 1.5hrs it pulls up to the door of the hotel. The train is slightly faster but if you don't know what you are doing with respect to the trains you could end up talking longer.There's not much around the hotel, but a free shuttle runs you to a nearby Japan Rail station every 15 minutes, and there are a few nice restaurants around there. The concierge is superb: friendly, helpful, and patient. They have lots of custom printed info for you to help you navigate Tokyo (which can be tricky for new visitors.This hotel is dated. It feels like it's from the 70s. However, it was well built and appointed nicely, so it's not run down by any means. However, the gym is pathetic, so if exercise is important to you, you might be served better elsewhere (or plan on going to a separate gym). I am surprised they advertise having a gym at all... it is basically a couple of treadmill, some barbells, and a couple of dated looking machines. To add insult to injury, they charge you to use it!The staff is wonderful and seem to like their jobs. The bathrooms are well maintained but frankly they could use an overhaul. Linoleum floors are right out of the 70's! Included in your bathroom is a multi-function toilet seat... more an amusement than a necessity for westerners.TV offerings are slim, with only 2 or 3 English stations, but this might be the standard in Japan (not sure).The beds are super comfortable and there are several types of pillows on the bed, so you are sure to find one you like.Laundry service is outrageously priced but as I was on business it's a must. There's no safe in the room., but crime in Japan seems rare.Overall, I would stay here again, but I might be interested in something with a more interesting location.

<Content>Can't Use the Pool We did not like this hotel. It advertises having a pool, one of the few in Tokyo. What they don't say is that you must be at least 13 years old to use it. No children are allowed in the pool, even with parents or guardians. This is not mentioned on the web site and is deceptive advertising. It is a 10 minute walk from the train station. Given that we could not use the pool, it was expensive for the size and quality of the room. We also had trouble with the wireless internet, it was not straight forward. We would not use this hotel again.

<Content>Excellent Choice! This is a great hotel! Awesome location in Tokyo and free shuttle busto Meguro Station on JR line. Also free shuttle in AM to Shinagawa station. The rooms were wonderful and the service impecable. The restaurants are expensive and we didn't eat at them but there is a great sushi place across the street from Meguro station bus stop nextto the Wendy's. I recommend this hotel.

<Content>Exceptional hotel! This was a business trip, so our travel agency booked me this hotel (our office is near here). I've stayed at a few Starwood properties - I'm SPG gold. This was by far the best experience I've had at a Sheraton, and maybe at any hotel.The staff here is simply amazing. Everyone from the bell desk to the concierge is so friendly, it feels as if you're doing them a huge favor by asking something of them - as if all they want most in the world is to help you. Wow. I could get used to this!The included breakfast buffet is western style, but with the addition of dim sum, as it's in the Chinese restaurant. The other restaurant I tried is the Cafe California, a French restaurant with Japanese influence. I had the full 6 course French meal, which was excellent.They have a bus that will run you to and from the JR Yamanote line - aka the Green Line, which runs around the perimeter of 'downtown' Tokyo. If you don't want to deal with the bus or are planning to be out after 10 when the bus stops, ask the concierge for a map of how to walk to the hotel from either of the very close subway stations. This makes the Miyako hotel an excellent base for exploring the city. Even getting here and away is easy, as the 'Airport Limosine (really a bus) stops here.All in all, I'm very impressed, and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, should the need arise for me to return to Tokyo.

<Content>Sheraton Miyako Tokyo - Not Bad On my recent Japan trip, I stayed at Sheraton Yokohama Bay and then at this hotel. Again, the Sheraton staff are extremely friendly and remain diligent at doing their jobs; rooms are cleaned superbly.The shuttle bus to Meguro Station and to Shinagawa Station in the mornings is convenient. The shuttle bus drivers are courteous as well.However, I find that the lavatories are a bit old and could use some refurbishing. This hotel is older than the Sheraton Yokahama Bay so I suspect the age of the hotel is the problem. Also, the TVs are too small. This is not a bad hotel, but it is not one of the most glamorous in Tokyo. With a few changes, I would stay here again.

<Content>Excellent hotel We enjoyed our stay at the Mikayo. The rooms are spacious, the toilet is a bit smaller than expect though. The staffs are very helpful. Quick check in and out. Free shuttle bus every 15 minutes to the JR Meguri station, and surrounded the stations, there are supermarket, department stores, and resturants. The bed are super comfortable.High recommended.

<Content>A nice business haven - good value for its level and amenities A great hotel with well appointed rooms - very friendly staff, beautiful garden , great pool. Only downside is that If you dont know Tokyo well and want to 'pop out' for some shopping this hotel is a bit far away from the main shopping areas. Negotiate a good rate yet beware of costly restaurants in the hotel. If you like chinese food the chinese restaurant here is renowned as one of the best in tokyo.

<Content>Great Service, Even for an Asian Hotel We spent four nights at the Radisson Miyako and found it better than two of the four hotels we stayed at in Japan. (The only one better was the Granvia in Kyoto). The Miyako distinguished itself with great service. At check-in you are given a schedule of the shuttle to the subway station (leaves every 15 minutes), a map of the restaurants in the hotel vicinity - even though there are nice restaurants in the hotel, and the schedule of the airport bus and instructions how to book it.There is free internet access in a room off the lobby. The Dai Ichi charged by the minute for their internet terminals and they weren't always working.Our room was huge and very comfortable. The bathroom was not finished as expensively as the other places we stayed, all fiberglass instead of marble, but it was large and offered everything you could want includine the reknown Japanese heated toilet seat.The lobby is huge and elegant with a very high-design Japanese character. It looks out on a lovely garden and there was always a fire burning in the fireplace (maybe not in the summer, but it was January). There were always people in the big comfortable chairs eating and drinking.The hotel is not in an interesting neighborhood; there are two universities nearby. But you have to travel to see Tokyo's best sights anyway because it's a huge city, and the subways are very easy to use and the cleanest and safest in the world. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Staff and Hotel I stayed at the Radisson Miyako Tokyo hotel on May 27-29, 2005 (two Nights). The check-in process was so easy and I was greeted with smiles at the front desk, and through the lobby leading up to the desk. The Bell captain (female) right away helped wit the bags and patiently stood by to help with directions along the way. After check-in she ushered us up to this beautiful room with cherry furnature and very very spacious. Oh, by the way don;t offer a tip - it's not the Japanese way(my first trip). After getting acclimated to the room i went down stairs to test the concierge's knowledge and man she was very very good and efficient. They have travel information and charges printed out for your convenience to all the important places of interest. She was also dressed in customery Japanese Kimono and english was great, and they went above and beyond.In the room you are greeted with choclate on your bed with a Japanese proverb or saying of the day, Plush pillows, heated toilet seats, coffee making facilities and various teas included(japanese past time), high speed internet access, toiletries, robes and slippers, mini bar and in room safe. The lobby had a nice relaxed feeling to it and was very inviting. The restaurants were a bit on the high price side so i tend to go not too far away to local Japanese restautrants to eat meals. There is a great garden aropund the hotel and they provide you with a free shuttle to the main train station and back. I'm tired of typing but if you are in Tokyo, please visit this hotel it's wonderful, with great friendly staff and do eat in the restaurant for 1 night.Thank you Radisson Miyako Hotel...! Keep up the great work.

<Content>quiet, classy and well run A busness trip brought me to the Radisson Miyako, Tokyo in the middle April of 2005. The outside of the building is dated, but the inside is dramatically upscale, muted and visually interesting. There is a massive lounge are with floor to ceiling glass and multiple nooks and crannies. The layout is initially confusing as there are personnel everywhere at little stations. The front desk is hidden, off to the right and not apparent to my Western eyes.My room, on the 11th floor, was superb. Though not large it was sized for efficiency and I quickly adapted. It has some manner of cable modem connection. I saw 3mb downloads. The bed was massive and really comfortable. The staff all friendly, the in house food was very good to excellant. There is one breakfast buffet, and it was very good. Overall it was one of the more relaxing business stays I've experienced as it always felt good to return to the hotel. Highly recommended.
