<Content>Fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just returned from a short break with my husband to The Mark Hotel and we thought it was great. Central location just a minute away from the main shopping street in West Berlin ( 2 miles long ) five minute walk to the main underground station that feeds to all berlin and same to the zoo which is a must ! Twenty yards away to The Hard Rock Cafe which is good when its minus 20 outside !! Rooms were small but ok maid service daily and the beds are the comfiest we have ever slept in breakfast was lacking abit of direction it seemed to me that you just had to find your own way easiest thing to do is just find your own table and look after yourselves because the waitresses are not very helpful they just busied around ignoring people. Go to the Soup Kulther at the bottom of the road for a take away soup . . . . . .FAB. Drinks a bit expensive at the bar but straight across the road is a little authentic german bar we went there every night. Would go back !! If you plan to sight see i suggest the Insider Berlin Tours see website we used them twice. Have a nice holiday.

<Content>Perfect Hotel This hotel was great. It reminded me a lot of an American hotel...a nice flatscreen tv (only english channels are news), comfy beds with great downcomforters, large room, and good size bathroom. The breakfast was amazing in the morning....very fresh. The location is great...right near the Hard Rock cafe...close to bus stop and metro as well as all the shopping and food you could want.

<Content>Disappointed on this occasion Myself and my husband have just returned from a weekend stay at the Berlin Mark Hotel, Our purpose for this visit was to visit the Christmas markets which were truly magical and I would not hesitate to recommend for any age group.Back to the purpose of this review the Berlin Mark Hotel. This is our third visit this year to this hotel. As you will see from my earlier reviews on this site the two previous occasions I have marked it as excellent. However on this occasion this was not the case.On arrival the receptionist seemed miserable and not very helpful. I suffer from multiple sclerosis and can only get around short distances with crutches otherwise I need my wheelchair. The hotel were informed of this as I always do in August when I booked and I requested a ground floor room suitable for a wheelchair. She then proceeded to inform us that there were no rooms available and we were put on floor 6 (Don't know what would have happened in the event of a fire). That was bad enough but the room was barely bigger than a rabbit hutch and the bathroom even smaller. Don't get me wrong this is a comfortable hotel and very clean with good breakfast and in a great location but the rooms are very small even if you are not disabled. But given that there are hundreds of similar hotels in this area of the same standard I will be booking elsewhere in future.

<Content>Loved the Berlin Mark A group of four guys from the US stayed in two rooms in the Berlin Mark for the week of November 21-27, 2008. I loved the hotel's location just off the K'dam and near the U and S Bahn. The rooms were comfortable, with nice linens and oversized pillows and the flat screen tv was a great touch. The bathroom was small, but adequate; the shower was probably the smallest one I have ever used, but none the less, got the job done. The daily breakfast was great, with almost anything you could possible want. It was a bit crowded in the late morning, but very well stocked most of the time.There were a couple of downsides. The room was HOT. Even with the steam heat completely cut off, we still had to open a window with it 0 degrees C outside. The hotel was also next to the Hard Rock Cafe, and when the window was open, there was a lot of late night noise, car noise and yelling from the direction of the HRC. However, it was still worth the money we paid.The previous review mentioned the rudeness of the staff. We were there the same time and we must have gotten a different staff. There were staff that were more friendly than others, but we were never made to feel unwelcome. In fact, one of the female staff went out of her way to find us reservations on a panaroma train as well as call taxis and recommend restaurtants. I had no issue with any staff whatsover.I would definitely stay at the Berlin Mark again. Its well situated for adventures all over the city and certainly is priced well.

<Content>Great stay in Berlin My parents and I stayed at the Berlin Mark in Fall '06. We had a wonderful stay. Here are the highlights of the stay:-- Very friendly check-in and staff.-- Nice, casual bar area.-- Wonderful, expansive, complete breakfast (mouth-watering remembering it).-- Flat Screen TVs.-- Great downtown Berlin location. Walking distance to shopping and restaurants.No complaints at all. As you can expect with most European hotels, the rooms were a bit on the small side by US standards. Our stay was quite pleasant at this hotel in Berlin.

<Content>Cheap(ish), clean and acceptable for a city centre hotel A convention at Berlin Messe saw me needing hotel accomodation for 2 nights in Berlin. As a couple of colleagues had chosen this hotel, I booked myself using a special rate on Expedia.The hotel was a little challenging to locate. I had never been to Berlin before and after getting off the S-Bahn at Zoologisher Garten I managed to spend about 20 minutes wandering around some back streets. Eventually I located the hotel, and thereafter it was only a 5 minute walk from the hotel to the station.Check in was quick and easy, and reception noted that one of my colleagues had already been asking for me. The room was clean and functional - a slightly strange shape but all that was really needed was a bed and a desk.Wireless internet is available but strangely only allowed access to Google and nothing else. The 10 euro access fee was refunded without question.The hotel's bathroom was the smallest I have ever come across. Without conjouring up too many horrific images, it was physically impossible to sit on the toilet - there was literelly no space at all. Breakfast was buffet style and a good choice of cold meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal etc was all availble, plus a couple of hot dishes.If I had paid rack rate I would probably have been disappointed but as I had paid a discounted Expedia rate, I was happy enough with the standard of the hotel. I would recommend providing a discounted rate can be secured.

<Content>Great Location We stayed as a group of 8 over the August Bank Holiday weekend 2008, the rooms, although not large were clean, comfortable, had plenty of storage space, flat screen TV and electronic safe. The staff were friendly, spoke very good English and were happy to help with directions and recommendations on where to visit. The Hotel has a great location, very close to shops, bars and restaurants. Will recommend to any friends who plan to visit Berlin in the future.

<Content>Good Deal for the Money We stayed at the Berlin Mark Hotel in July and the hotel is a good deal for the money. The rooms are average size for a European Hotel but the single beds were extremely small. The mattresses and comforter were comfortable but the one pillow provided for each bed was paper thin. The room did have air conditioning which kept the room adequately cooled however the exterior temperatures were cool also so I'm not sure how it would do in extreme heat. The bathrooms are very small and the shower did not drain on our first day. After speaking with the front desk the following morning, the problem was solved. Regardless, water did run through the sliding stand-up shower screen so you will need to make sure the bath mat is down to sop up the water.There are excellent restaurants and the Hard Rock Cafe in close proximity to the hotel. Shopping is located all over Kudamm so take a right out of the hotel and you will run right into it.There are two U-Bahn stations within 2 blocks but one main train line is down until the end of the year. This created a big inconvenience as this was the line we most commonly used.Overall, the front desk staff was helpful and polite. The breakfast buffet was very good and the housekeeping service was timely and clean. Internet service was included in my room rate but it is very expensive (50E per week) if you have to pay for it. The connection was a bit slow but adequate.You really can't beat the price. The rooms are extremely ordinary but a great value.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Location of hotel great for transport and also quiet at night. The breakfast, although busy from 8am onwards, was good. The staff were very friendly and helpful. A Lidyl supermarket was just down the street and good for rolls for lunch time and buying bottled water. Would recommend an Italian Restaurant called Stella Di Mare at 162, Uhlandstrabe, which was a 5 minute stroll from the Hotel. The service, quality of food and prices was excellent. On future return visits to Berlin I will stay at this hotel.

<Content>Good Central Hotel Stayed at the Berlin Mark hotel for an overnight on a business trip. The hotel is central to shops, restaurants and public transport. Its on the same street as the Hard Rock Cafe. The rooms are pretty basic, but were clean and had really comfy beds. This hotel would be a good choice for a weekend break.

<Content>great hotel, great position BERLIN MARK HOTELI did my homework and it paid off!!! i was charged with booking a break for ourselves and two other couples. i read all the reviews, not just trip advisors, i looked at al options for price and location and chose the berlin mark.what a great choice for our first trip to this fab city. 5 mins from the zoo station, great flashy reception, great rooms, clean as a whistle, perfect location, 2 mins from the shops and bars. we were there when germany beat portugal, the place went barmy, yet we heard nothing when we went back to the hotel.the breakfast is fantastic, if you can`t find anything you like, you`re not hungry!!. only question was why no tea making facilities in the rooms, but i will go there again anyday, and no, i don`t work for the hotel!!

<Content>Good location good price The hotel is only a 15 minute cab ride from Tiegel airport, and very well located. Front of house staff friendly and efficient. For the the price room sizes good - bathroom a bit too small though.Breakfast buffet is fine but on the second day of our stay the room was so busy we couldn't get a table. A minor quibble though.This is a good value 3 star and I can recommend its central location.

<Content>Great Hotel for Short Stay in Berlin My husband and I stayed at the Berlin Mark Hotel for two nights in June 2007 in a double room (breakfast included). We arrived at the hotel much earlier than the 3pm check-in time, but as our room was already available, the Reception staff (all of whom were very polite) allowed us to check-in early. This was very helpful as it meant that we were able to drop off our bags before heading out to explore Berlin. Our room was very small, even by European standards, but was clean and comfortable enough for a short stay. The Continental breakfast was satisfactory; and as there are two large dining rooms, there were always lots of tables available, even at peak times. One of the main reasons we opted to stay at the hotel was its location. It is within a short walk of both the S-Bahn and U-Bahn, and there are several restaurants/cafes, including the Hard Rock Caf茅, on the same street.Overall, this middle-of-the-road hotel more than lived up to our expectations in terms of cost, service, and location; and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to spend a few days in Berlin.

<Content>Fantastic hotel This was one of many hotels I stayed at on a recent European trip,  I have to say that it is was one of the best. It is in a fantastic location, very close to public transport and the main shopping street. The room was one of the biggest I had in Europe  was clean with modern furnishings. I booked in as a business traveller  so was told to go to a seperate breakfast room which was great, so I don't know if that made a difference, but I was truly disappointed that I was only booked in for one night here. The lobby is a bit tired  it took a while to check in, but I found the Reception staff helpful with their information, once they were free to serve me! For the location  the quality of the room it was an absolute bargain  I would not hesitate to recommend it.

<Content>Steve Please read this before before booking your break away in this hotel. All together we were a group of 8 on a 3 night stay in Berlin as part of a package starting from Thursday through to Sunday. We decided to book an extra night online and arrive on a Wednesday.When we arrived at the hotel, the reception staff appeared to be very unhelpful, I would say to state they were not friendly would be an understatement. So we proceeded to check in, or at least attempted to. The receptionist then informed us that dispite booking on Expedia with this hotel, they were not expecting us until the following day, where 3 nights were booked. Instead they told us that we were in their sister hotel for 1 night. We were told to go, the only instruction given was to turn right outside door and straight down.After about ten minutes of lugging our luggage around we found an old building which later we found was the sister hotel. Walking in the hotel was dirty and dated. Our hotel room was really not an improvement. Very basic facilities with dated furniture. We had a small fridge with a mini bar, which had a selection of 6 drinks. The hotel was situated in a seedy part of town.The bathroom was small. The shower sprayed more water over the curtian then into the bath itself, each time after taking a shower the bathroom floor was soaked. We decided to go back and urgue our case. We booked the Berlin Mark Hotel and not the Appt Berlin Mark Hotel. When we went the back the unhelpful receptionist's told us that in fact we were expected there and not the sister hotel, we should never have been sent away. Although it was there error, they actually still refused to move us, they told us it was too late to be moved as we had already checked in. We asked to speak to a Manager for help, they told us to take a seat. After about 15 minutes we re-approached the receptionist as nobody came out to see us, and were told that there was nothing they could do, despite it being their error. We gave up and returned the following day for the remainder of our stay. The hotel was not much of an improvement. Room was very basic with the same features of the old Appt Berlin Hotel.Breakfast was always busy. Tables were hardly ever cleared from the previous people and by the time a fresh pot of coffee arrived, or your milk did - it was time to leave. The service was dreadful.Throughout our stay we would often liase with recpeption staff, but again they were always unhelpful. They appeared not to want to help you, and was always a real effort engaging with them. Not once did they smile.A memeber of our group was sent to another hotel to iron her eveining clothes - when she returned stating that she could not find hotel they directed her the hotel opposite. They could have done this at the begining instead of sending her on a hike of the backstreets of Berlin.So, if you are not looking for service, unfriendly staff, basic facilities then I recommend you book this place! Please do not be fooled by the pictures on the internet - If you book this hotel, please expect an 'Allocation on Arrival' service as you will have no idea where you will be placed.

<Content>Es tut mir leid... Very upset with this hotel. We had booked as part of a group for three nights from Thursday and then booked an extra night for the Wednesday night via Expedia. Although this was advertised and showed photogaphs of the Berlin Mark on Meineke Strasse we found this not to be the case AFTER we had arrived at the hotel and the receptionist simply looked up the reservation in her system, pointed to the crossroads and informed us that the hotel we were staying in was around the corner and four minutes away. No map, no directions and no further offer of assistance.We went to visit the hotel to find that it was a converted apartment block in a rather seedy part of a very busy road. No Bar, a makeshift breakfast room. No restaurant and a basic bedroom which was large but a rather dirty and poorly decorated bathroom. We retrurned to the Berlin Mark Hotel on Meineke Strasse to plead our case that we we were under the impression that we had booked that hotel and wanted to be there for the four nights and not have to change the following day as our friends were due to arrive the next day. Suddenly, the receptionist found a reservation for us which means that they had expected us all along and was about to check us into that hotel when she realised that her colleague had sent us off to another property. In fact BOTH receptionists on Thursday afternoon were very surly and discourteous and even after me asking if I could speak with somebody else and being TOLD to take a seat in the bar as it would take a while before someone could see us, we were left waiting until I had to go back to the empty desk to see if somebody could talk to us. All I could be told was that as I had booked through Expedia, there was nothing they could do. I tried politely to explain that after 25 years int he hotel industry I knew that they could, in fact, transfer a booking within the hotel if they really wanted to - again, to no avail. If you do not expect any kind of service whatsoever then go ahead and book these hotels but be sure what you are getting as they also have a third old building across the street which is a little more convenient than having to drag luggage three long blocks but as it has lots of stairs and no lift it is also below standard.We finally accepted our fate and reconciled to spend the night in the cell block. the only saviour was the ARTOTEL across the street which had a nice bar and pleasant staff so they got our business. The shower in the bathroom simply sprayed water everywhere in the APART HOTEL (read falling APART Hotel) causing the bathroom floor to flood and cause a very dangerous health  safety hazardBreakfast in the Mark Hotel in Meineke Strasse was absolutely chaotic with surly, rude staff who snapped at you if you asked them to bring tea or coffee pots or more orange juice or bread fort oast.A member of our group was sent by reception to two local dry cleaners shops to get an outfit for that evening ironed before sending her to their hotel accross the street where they had a laundry facility all the time thus wasting an hour and making her late for her evening function.So, some of the poorest service I have ever experienced, misleading advertising, surly/miserable/rude staff and awful public areas. Thank goodness there are plenty of alternative hotels for future visits and for us to recommend to others.

<Content>Excellent Value Arrived at hotel after late flight into hotel, easy to find as a short walk from Zoo station. Check in was efficient, and room was spacious and clean with flat screen television. Some floors appeared to not have been recently updated/ redecorated, so this maybe something to watch out for. Breakfast was included in the rate (拢54 per night through lastminute) and was fine, a bit crowded but a good selection. Construction works were on-going in this area, so finding a free table was a bit of a hassle. Didn't eat at the hotel but had some drinks and the bar was efficient. Overall very impressed with standards given the price paid, value for money which often seems to be missed in reviews.

<Content>Superb, good value for money Overall, this Hotel provided us with exacly what we needed. The rooms were very spacious and immaculately kept.The staff were all very freindly and polite and on hand 24 hours a day. The hotel was cheap for us to book so we weren't expecting very much but we were both very pleased with everything about the Meineke Mark Hotel.I would receomend this Hotel for anyone visiting Berlin for the first time as it holds an excellent central location but remained just far enough off the main street to get a good nights sleep. The rail links from here are also easily reached by foot.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel is situated right off the Kudamm and within 5 minutes walk from the Kudamm u-bahn station. I had booked online and asked for a non-smoking room, and I got it. In fact, the room was enormous and very luxurious. We were quite sad to only stay one night, but we had to catch a train to Poland at 6:30am the next morning. Despite our checking out before 6:30am, the time at which the breakfast started, we were invited to have a seat and to eat from the buffet before our departure. Although not everything was available yet, we had a great selection of breads, cheeses and cold cuts. Also, the staff was friendly and helpful.We stayed three other nights in Berlin later in August at a much more expensive, and supposedly better rated hotel. Hands down, the Berlin Mark Hotel was superior in value, not only location wise but also service wise. I would definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>A great deal and nice area For 88 euros a night (double room), this hotel is an excellent value. The lobby isn't very impressive, and we were a bit worried as we headed up to our room, but it was fairly modern, clean and had a nice view down to the road. I had read that the street was a bit noisy, but we found it to be very quiet actually. Slept VERY well. This hotel is also dog-friendly, though there aren't any parks very close by. Secure parking is available in the garage next door for 11 euros a day. Overall, we were very pleased with our pick and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Good location Nice hotel with good location near the shopping area, subway station, Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church etc. Rooms are quite small, but clean and modern. Plenty of TV channels in many languages.Nice breakfast, although the breakfast room is quite crowded. They had on some days another breakfast room opened on another floor.They were kind enough to allow us an early check-in. Polite staff.

<Content>Good Hotel and Great Value The Hotel was great, we really enjoyed our stay and will without a doubt stay there again. The location is perfect its about 3 minutes walk from the famous shopping street Ku'damm and access to public transport is same. The hotel itself is in our opinion fantastic value for money, we stayed in a double room which had a mini bar, flat screen t.v, comfortable bed with crisp white bed linen, great ensuite and more than enough storage, the little bunch of fresh flowers in the bathroom was a real nice touch! The breakfast was good, everything was so fresh, beautifully displayed and the choice of food was extensive, breakfast can be busy but there is ample tables, just need to look.Only real slight problem was being woke up on two nights by other residents, (adults not students!) but the hotel dealt with it very rapidlyThe staff in all departments were very friendly and very efficient.. Agreat value for money hotel.

<Content>A Very Pleasant Surprise Stayed here for four nights in January 2007 and based on past reviews was somewhat worried but my fears were unfounded. Positives were absolutely great central location on quiet side street, wonderful complete German breakfast included in the price, and a price that couldn't be beat for the location. In addition, the room itself was very up to date - non-smoking (though had to persist to get it), flat screen LCD TV on the wall, had a chair that opened to single bed for our son easily, had hair dryer (important for my wife), nice desk staff, very comfortable beds for my wife and I. Only drawback was even in winter the room was too warm at night even though we turned off the heat.

<Content>Second visit Stayed in this hotel over New Year for the past 2 years. 2004  2005.Ideally located and a comfortable hotel. Yes, breakfast is a little busy, but come on folks, be patient! What do some people want! The food was great and always plentiful and was replenished regualrly. The rooms had modern decor and were far more than adequate. We got great deals on both occasions, and could not complain for the price.It is ideally placed to tour Berlin from. The tour bus goes from the end of the street and is close to Zoo Station.The nearby restaurants were excellent, the one almost opposite -called the Meineke I believe, was good, but we also enjoyed the small restaurant, which you would probably mistake for a bar on the same side as the hotel at the top of the street as you head towards the Ku'Damn.Berlin is a top city and highly recommended for New Year!Try out a trabi safari - it is great fun - especially in 3ft of snow in a car with no heating......................or brakes come to think of it!!

<Content>Top Marks for the Mark I was a little worried whether I had made the right choice of so many Berlin hotels after reading several negative reviews on TA. However, these were completely dispelled on arrival. Check in was efficient and reception staff helpful and polite. The room was exceptionally clean, fresh and quiet with crisp bedding, plasma TV and a pristine bathroom with lovely towels and fresh flowers. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious, fresh fruit and even a toaster! Catering staff were friendly and efficient, replenishing empty fruit juice and milk containers quickly. Yes, it was busy, but there are extra tables in the lobby and bistro. The location of the Mark is excellent, easy 10 mins walk to station, buses and shops. There are at least 4 restaurants in the same street. As a regular European traveller I was most impressed, and for 65Euros a night for a twin room. Ignore the negative reviews!

<Content>Top marks for the Berlin Mark Hotel Having spent three nights in the Berlin Mark Hotel I must pass on my findings.The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating to any request.The hotel decoration in the corridor area leading to the bedrooms could do with a update but the rooms were very clean tidy and modern. Maid service excellent and staff very friendly.Bar facility available in the room although a kettle with tea/coffee facilities within the room would have been welcomed. The cost of coffees in the bar was very reasonable and always served with a smile.Rooms very comfortable and clean with excellent showering facilities. Cable TV. Fresh fruit at the front reception should anyone wish a piece/s.Meals were excellent, breakfast first class.Location is only 100 mtrs from the Kurfustendamm and very central for bus and S bahn.Luggage room available. I would certainly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate in returning. I look forward to my next visit.

<Content>Stay away... I have just returned from a weekend in Berlin, where I stayed at the Berlin Mark Hotel.The best thing about this hotel is the location: around the corner from the Kurfurstendam, in central Berlin, and close to lots of public transport. Also, getting taxis from hotel never took more than 3 minutes when the hotel called, which was rather impressive.The hotel is very basic and the room I was given had a single bed (I haven't seen this in hotels for years!) and was smaller than most student accommodation I have seen! The room was extremely basic and the bed and pillow were far too soft, which made me have a terrible time sleeping. I was also given a smoking room. I don't recall Expedia (with whom I booked) asking if I wanted a smoking or non-smoking room, so I felt I didn't have arguments to change. When I asked for a non-smoking room I was told they were fully booked and I couldn't change. Fair enough, but I think there is only one floor in the whole building (of 7 floors) that is non-smoking, so be aware of that when booking.The staff are helpful and nice but the whole place is in serious need of a refurbishment. The decor is very early 80s with some nauseating bright green everywhere... It was also strange to be handed a key, rather than a card for the room, but I suppose that is just me.Brekfast is plentiful but very basic. Beware of smoking areas for people having breakfast that are very close to non-smoking. In fact, the hotel reeked of cigarettes.In other words, if you don't mind the comfort of your bed and if you are a smoker, you will love it! If not, stay away. There are plenty of hotels to choose from in the area.

<Content>Loved this hotel. I loved this hotel. You can't beat the location and the value. Our room was spotless, great shower and delicious full breakfast. We never had trouble finding a seat and we went at all times of the morning. The area the hotel is in is lovely and it is minutes away from the Zoo Station where you can get any bus or train in the city. We found the staff at the hotel to be lovely. I would stay here again.

<Content>Not the greatest hotel we have stayed in Hotel location was good, rooms were clean  the housekeeping staff were lovely. Room smelt of smoke when 'no smoking' requested. Room was small - no bath  the shower room was very small with a tiny corner shower. The Reception staff were aloof  sometimes quite rude. Breakfast was very average  waiting staff very average - on the plus side Berlin was amazing the restaurant across the road from the Mark Hotel - The Meineke Restaurant was lovely both food wise  staff wise  there was a little bar on the same side of the road as the hotel but near to Kurfurstendamm str can't remember the name but the late night atmosphere for couples was romantic and welcoming - see as much as you can Berlin it is a lovely city - we will return - different hotel though!

<Content>Truly awful The Mark Hotel on Meineke Strasse is truly not a 3 star hotel. The hotel is very tired and is in desperate need of a refurb.The staff are surly and not interested in any problems you may have. When we booked the room the description on the website said it came with a separate seating area, despite raising the issue with reception we were basically told this was not so , I guess someone needs to amend the website.The room given to us was on the first floor. Supposedly a non smoking room it came complete with ash tray and matches. The room was not very big and the bed took up the majority of the room. The room was at the back of the hotel and overlooked an overgrown garden with a block of flats looking directly onto the rooms. Although the bed linen was clean there wasn't much going for the room at all. The furniture is dark brown and very old and battered and the sliding wardrobe door seemed to be just about hanging on.As for the bathroom well what can we say. The shower sliding door is barely big enough for a normal sized person to get through. The frame of the shower was also falling to pieces and came off in your hand when you closed the door.The shower had no height adjustment bar and so showering each morning was quite difficult. Also it was difficult to regulate the water and it was either boiling hot or freezing cold. You either had to sit cross legged on the shower floor or stand up and use the shower by hand. The hot tap became very hot and a towel had to be used to turn it off. We complained to management three times but nothing was done. One of the lamps over the sink had blown and despite telling the cleaner it was still not changed. The bathroom had had the tiles painted to give the appearance of a newly refurbished room. Breakfast was hardly worth the effort. There were not enough tables for everyone and some people who couldn't get a table ended up going away. If you came down late most of the food had gone and was not replenished. Coffee was luke warm and not a teabag in sight only various types of Twinings darjeeling. We did notice a room next to reception with more tables and a waitress walking in and out with coffee but no one was told if this room was an extra room for breakfast. In fact the room was used to store suitcases for people checking out of their rooms. It was not locked so anyone could walk in.The main reception area and corridors stink of cigarette smoke as there is a table and chairs positioned along the corridor for smokers.The only good thing we can say it that the hotel is in a very good position just off ku'damm and great for exploring Berlin.

<Content>good hotel, horrible service The hotel was very nice and the breakfast was great. Our only problem was the lack of customer service from the individuals at the front desk. The were curt, rude, and when we had a problem with our air conditioner told us that maybe we were used to high powered air conditioning but this is good for here.

<Content>Great location, but....... Stayed here late March 2006.Very short walk from the train station,very convenient for the city.What sticks out really bad is the decor of the reception area.I felt as though i was in a 80's time warp and i got very worried what would the room be like !.But the room had just been updated and had a nice modern feel,with pale colours and comfortable fittings.Our blind fell off the window at first tug...and not fixed for the entirety of our stay.The room was at the front of the hotel near the really busy cross road,much traffic noise with the windows open,as so much noise from passers by from the 'hard rock cafe' just down the street until 5 in the morning.While we were there a couple of coach loads of teenegers arrived and stayed in the accomodation righ opposite,these kids were obviously not being supervised as they were on the street every night until the early hours partying !.Breakfast is a very well laid out buffet with lots of choice,the only moan here is with so many guests it was hard to find a table,or even when you found a vacant one it was not cleared/cleaned.But on the whole as with all budget hotels there are up's and down's.On the plus....great location....nice rooms/clean.I would stay there again if visiting this magnificent city,but would ask for a room round back.

<Content>Great Deal, Perfect location I was very pleased with the Berlin Mark Hotel. Can't beat the price for the service, room size, breakfast!! Not only was it a great location ,5 min walk to subway, rail station, great shops, restaurants, Zoo, but it was on a quite street. Our double room was very big by most european standards,. Breakfast was very good with nice variety of hot and cold items. Staff very friendly. Even if your not on a family vacation with the kids, check out the Berlin Zoo!! It is close by and one of the best city zoos my husband and I have ever been to ( and we have been to many). I would most defiantly stay here again next time I am in Berlin.

<Content>Marks Hotel Meneike in Berlin-Spare but really good location I stayed in this hotel last week. This hotel is located in a very good area-so location-wise it is four stars. Very accesible to public transportations, 20 minutes from Tegel Airport by bus (#109). Very -very convenient.The hotel is only marked by a green door with a small sign above it- if you blink you would miss it. At around $50.00 a night- it is a good value. $95.00 for week end nights is a bit steep.Breakfast is included- which is a bonus- a pretty good spread- it is possible to have a big breakfast- skip/small lunch- and a big dinner.The room was the definition of bare essentials, mine was a single, it was pretty small. My room has a toilet and shower- no bath tub. The old TV was changed to a flat screen while I was there- so this hotel is doing some upgrading. My room was at the back- it was quiet.Rooms are located off a corridor that is very motel-like except for the original art works along the walls. Caution- the entrance is on the second floor- so I had to lug my heavy suitcase up one flight of stairs. This hotel is not handicap accessible.The staff was friendly and helpful.I will go back if I travel alone or with a regular friend- this is not the hotel for a romantic vacation.

<Content>Great value... Got a good deal on this hotel and we loved it.Room was a bit small, but very clean.Located about 2 minutes from big shopping area (Kufursterdam) and about 4 minutes from underground station (Kufursterdam again), this hotel was great for us. We always walked 10 minutes to get to the big ZOO station, which connects to just about every line.Lobby has a nice bar and a big room for breakfast. Breakfast was goods with fresh fruit, bacon, eggs, sausage. Proved to be a good start to each day.We had no worries at this hotel and would stay there again if in Berlin.

<Content>Fantastic We have just returned from a 4 night stay in Berlin and stayed at this hotel. Everything about it is good. Clean rooms, plenty of hot water for showers etc. Hair dryers, excellent maid service. Breakfast something else - everything you could wish for to start the day and a good time slot too - breakfast at the week end is served until 12 noon!!! Ideal for sleepyheads!The only down point was that it is just along the road from the Hard Rock Cafe which appears to close around 2am - but if you close the windows (they are double glazed) it doesnt really bother you too much.The location of this hotel is perfect - right on the doorstep to the shops, underground, buses and sight-seeing buses too.We found a fantastic restaurant too in Joachimstaler Strasse called Blauer Flug - really good meal there too so all in all we spent a fantastic 4 day city break in Berlin and cant wait to go back!

<Content>Great Location An adequate hotel in all respects. Everything about the hotel itself is more or less average, but its location on Meinekestrasse takes it into the above average category. A block off the top of Kufurstendam, two blocks from Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Plenty of restaurants, shops and activity in the immediate neighborhood. Three or four U-bahn lines stop within a block or two. The hop-on/hop-off tour bus originates a block away. Convenient for arrival by train; the Zoo railway station is a five-minute walk from the hotel. If arriving by plane at Tegel Airport, take bus #109 and ask to be let off at Ulandstrasse. Continue walking two blocks in the same direction and turn right on Meinekestrasse. The hotel is large and caters mostly to groups and business travelers.

<Content>Great Value in a convenient location I found the Berlin Mark Hotel fantastic value for money. The rooms were spacious and impeccably clean, our room was cleaned every morning. The breakfast was fantastic, buffet style to suit every taste and as much as you want. The reception staff during the day were not too helpful but the night staff were lovely and also the bar staff.The area of Ku'damn is a bit commercial but very safe. I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel.

<Content>Good location, clean hotel We paid around $63 a night for our stay in the Berlin Mark Hotel. The room was on the small side but it was very clean the bathroom was huge and modern. The only complaint about the room might be that it was kind of small but this didn't bother us as we just wanted a clean, safe place to sleep.The breakfast (included in the price) was AMAZING! No continental breakfast here! There were eggs, cold cuts, sausage, bacon (one morning), yogurt, fresh and dried fruits, juice, crackers, several different kinds of bread, dessert, etc. You could easily take some stuff for a little snack later in the day. The breakfast alone was worth the price.The location was good. It was under a 10 minute walk to the Berlin Zoo station from which you can catch trains and the metro (U-Bahn). It was right off of the main shopping street. I personally thought that all of the interesting sights seemed to be in East Berllin and found that we were going there to eat, sightsee, etc. Otherwise, I can't really complain about the location. It's right next to the Hard Rock Cafe and down the block from a Dunkin Donuts/Easy Internet cafe.It might be worth mentioning that there seemed to be a lot of school/tour groups staying in the hotel. Sometimes you could hear them in the hallways but it was never a problem or really annoying at all. Also, there was usually a wait for a table at breakfast because everyone in the group seems to eat at the same time.No matter where you stay I highly recommend taking the Free Berlin tour (it leaves from in front of the Dunkin Donuts across from the Berlin Zoo station and you can find info about it posted there). This was really a great tour and it was a highlight of the trip for me.
