<Content>Roaches! Beware of roaches and bad customer service! Woke up to roaches on the bed when I went down to ask for a different room they said they MIGHT be able to change or they could come in a spray - whatever! The front desk came to the room and found two more roaches. Stay away from this hotel.

Not helpful at all, couldnt care about the guests.Needs major renovations very dated.Room was supposed to be views to city, HA Ha, instead we looked onto another accomodation place which you could see into their rooms.

<Content>Unfortunate Experience We booked a two week stay at the Queen Kapiolani. We were familiar with this hotel and it's very convenient location, but had never been inside.We booked using Expedia.com and we don't usually travel using high end hotels so we didn't expect a lot. We knew going in that there was a possiblity we would not like the room from the reviews, so when booking we intentionally booked a slightly higher grade room, we booked a Standard Plus City View Room which according to Expedia has a lanai, two queen or one king bed. When we arrived to check in, the man at the desk commented on how we booked using the internet. This should have been my first clue that things would not go well. When we received our room number we were giving a room on the 5th floor. After reading all the reviews I knew to ask for a higher room so when I asked; I was told that they were completely booked due to the Honolulu Marathon and to check the next morning to see if a room opens up. My husband and I went up to the room and it was right next to the elevator shaft. The room itself had 2 twin beds pushed together, no lanai and was dirty. The wallpaper was falling off the wall, it wasn't vacuumed thoroughly, the bureau door hiding a refrigerator was sticky. At some point that night we had misplaced something and made the mistake of looking under the bed... there was q-tips, a water bottle and some informational cards for an adult enterainment place. Gross. The next morning we went to the lobby to ask for the room we paid for and they said they couldn't help us, they said they were completely booked for the marathon and that the room was what we paid for. (we ended up in the lowest grade Standard room)There was one guy at the front desk who appeared to be initially helpful. He tried to move our room and implied that there would be a room available higher the next day, but when his manager heard him she came running over and overrode his efforts by insisting that there was no room. He likely would have moved us and implied he could. But once his supervisor came in, his hands were tied. The managers claim was that the Marathon was the problem and that there was no way to move us. We tried everything... asking to be moved up until the marathon, moving out for that night and that back in, but they would not cooperate. That was when we called Expedia. I went back to the room and called Expedia and confirmed that we did in fact book a room with a lanai, 2 queen beds or 1 king (not 2 twins pushed together) and then the Expedia rep called the front desk. We remained on hold in the room when the Expedia rep came back on the line... she was less than happy. She said the hotel was refusing to cooperate and that the hotel front desk staff claimed that there are no rooms in the hotel that met the description provided by Expedia. The hotel was trying to imply that Expedia came up with the descriptions itself. Expedia said that all hotel room descriptions are provided by the hotel marketing department directly and are not originated by Expedia. This makes sense to me, how would Expedia know all the details of every hotel and room type, they couldn't. We were either to stay 2 weeks in this grungy dirty room, when we paid for a higher grade room, or we had to transfer hotels. We transferred. We were so disappointed with the Queen Kapiolani and it's misrepresentation of room. I can't believe that they would be willing to give up a 2 week stay like that, but one night at the Queen Kapiolani was more than enough for us. It seems clear that they have two levels of service, one for those who book directly with them and one for those who book online. The whole hotel is older and in need of renovations. We looked at the restaurant but would not eat there. I will concede that the location is great, that's why we initially chose it, but it's too bad they have not mastered customer service after all these years. I suppose they figured that tourists will put up with less than what they paid for if they appear to have no options. Sorry, but I know my options and I chose to take it.

<Content>Good location, that's about it. I stayed in a standard plus city view room for one week with my partner. I was very disappointed with the standards in this hotel. I booked the cheapest room that they have  it honestly felt as though they had no interest in budget travellers. When we first arrived the staff were pleasant  friendly but gave us no information about the hotel facilities or local area. Our room was on the 6th floor (no prblems with the lifts, slow sometimes but not a big issue). We had a view down over the pool and towards the sea  the zoo to the left. The room was shabby. There was no King sized bed as advertised. It was two singles stuck together - which is a common thing to see but the sheets didn't cover the bottom of the beds and there was only one bedside table. The bedside table had the biggest, most oversized lamp I have ever seen which took over the table. There was a small table with two chairs beside the window, the air conditioning was underneath. The room was tiny  cramped, but had a fridge, coffee maker and decent TV. There were black marks all over the bathroom floor but otherwise it was clean. Housekeeping left plenty of towels  were very friendly. We ate in the restaurant once for breakfast, never again. It has the decor of a dodgy old-folks home and the food was dreadful (bacon dripping with grease etc). A few days later I asked a member of restaurant staff to borrow a knife  fork for my room  he said no (which is fine if thats the rules) but he was very rude to me. I chose this hotel because it fit into my price range and had a good location. I regret choosing this hotel and think we would have been better off in the hostel next door.

<Content>good for price We booked on line for A$148 per night and were happy with the hotel. At end of strip so its easy to find, good to travel to/from by bus. The rooms/hotel are in bad need of makeover but its clean enough. We had great views from our 17th floor room.we are going back to Oahu in 2 weeks and will be e-booking.

<Content>Best Value in Town I've visited Hawaii more than 25 times in the last 30 years and have stayed at many hotels, including 4 or 5 stays at this one. The Queen Kapiolani has ocean view or dead-on, unobstructed Diamond Head view rooms for about $100 a night--sometimes even less if you book at the hotel's website. Yes, the hotel looks a bit tired and there are a lot of newer and more luxurious properties than this one, but be prepared to fork over at least $100 more a day for rooms with a comparable view. I can't stress enough how much nicer a visit to Hawaii is when you're not facing a brick wall or garage outside your window but the natural beauty you came here for in the first place. Always request a high floor (15,16,17,18) when making your reservation and don't economize by booking a lesser room with no view (you'll only save about $20 anyway) or you'll be very disappointed. Sitting on your lanai at dawn with the ocean or Diamond Head in front of you is an unbeatable way to start the day.

<Content>Great Bargain Got this room for 10 days at $69/night. Reading the reviews left on this website prior to going I was very skeptical. I learned a valuable lesson, don't listen to everything you hear. This hotel is old, needs renovating. If you want ammenities go somewhere else, if you want a room to sleep/shower in, book this hotel. Perfect location for getting onto Waikiki beach or jumping on H1 to get to Northshore or windward side of the island. The staff seemed nice, although I never asked them for one thing the entire time. The restaraunt was cheap and the food was descent. The room, well it had clean beds and a clean bathroom, that's all I care about. I was never kept up by noise at night, although in the morning you could hear the birds in the zoo, which I enjoyed. Parking is $15/day and the lot always had an open spot somewhere. The only complaint that I have is the elevators were slow during peak times like 9-10 am and 5-7 pm. We were gone doing stuff the entire time we stayed in this hotel so it was great for us, if you plan to use your room for more than a sleeping/hygiene spot then I would recommend another hotel.

<Content>overall great value my wife and i stayed here for 9 nights booking a package deal. had read about slow elevator and outdated rooms, but decided to go for it. not disappointed at all. the rooms were a little outdated, popcorn ceiling bad paint in places, but the rooms were huge, suite size where i stayed on 9th floor with large living room and couch and a decent balcony with great diamondhead view and partial ocean view. i only upgraded for diamondhead view so ocean was a bonus. staff was efficient and helpful when asked but not overtly courteous. elevators were slow...but we were in hawaii so...hang loose right? loved the location of the hotel, at the end of the strip was perfect for us. plus just a stones throw from ted's biggest burgers. would definately stay here again.

<Content>recommended by a friend We stopped in Hawaii on our way to and from Australia Dec 2007-Jan 2008. A friend had recommended the Queen based on a stay from several years before. Although older, the hotel provided a clean and comfortable place to stay for our visit -- a one-night stay going over and several nights coming back from Australia. We were able to get to all of the places we wanted to visit around Honolulu while we were there. The beach was within easy walking distance.

<Content>Bed Bugsssss At first the hotel seem very nice and clean that was until we spent the second night when I staring to wake up in the middle of the night itching. At first I thought it was the weather or maybe the sand, water or just the new environment but no I was wrong they were BED BUGS!!!!! It took me 3 different doctors (thank God I work in a hospital) to find the diagnosis to my rashes and itching. And that鈥檚 not the worst part! The worst part is that I brought them with me I had to buy a new bed. I HATE IT!!!!!!!!

<Content>Good Value My wife, myself and two kids spent one night here. We chose this hotel essentially as a cheap alternative since we arrived late and didn't want to spend the additional money for the resort hotel we were going to next since it was after midnight when we got in. Overall for the price I found the hotel fine. The room was small (two double beds) but we had a deck with a view of Diamond Head, and the room was clean. I didn't check out the pool but I know one's there. One thing that I liked was the location was great. It's only one block from the beach on one end of Waikiki, so it was easy to just wander down from the hotel and you were immediately on the beach or you could start wandering down the main street. Overall, a decent option if you need a cheap place to stay overnight in Honolulu, or if you're on a budget this would be a good option.

<Content>Positive experience I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights, my room was located on the 12th floor with a stunning Ocean and Diamonds head view.The room was spacious, bright, with a clean bathroom and a large lanai. The carpet and the forniture were a bit worn, however you cannot expect a luxury or a penthouse room paying just 80 $ per night. You get what you pay for!!I seriously reccomend this hotel for people who look for a budget/medium price accomodation close to all the Waikiki's amenities(Beach, Kapiolani Park, Bars, Starbucks)MahaloMarco - Italy

<Content>Great service after the earthquake My husband  I frequently stay at the QK with a large group. For this particular working vacation, we were awakened at 7:00 am by a 6.7 earthquake centered off of the Big Island. Being Californians we both knew what was happening. After the 2nd shock the electricity went off. However, the QK has a backup generator which provided light in the halls  the elevators to work.We went downstairs (via stairs)  found that the restaurant was open for breakfast as long as the food did not require cooking. This was only for the period of time it took to confirm that the gas lines were OK. The restaurant remained open for guests only. Many of the hotels on Waikiki closed their restaurants. Since everything on Waikiki was closed this did pose a problem for many  forced them to join the long lines at the ABC stores. to make matters worse it rained most of the day which made for a bad beach day. What impressed me the most was that the hotel staff kept posting regular updates on what was happening. Most of the other hotels didn't tell their guests anything so many people wandered around not knowing what was going on. Our power was out for over 12 hours but again the QK came through by having lights operated by generators in the lobby. The only down side was that only the toilets on the first 3 floors were operational but we dealt with that. The QK may be an older, run down hotel but in my opinion they get kudos for the service they provided that day. We stay there every year with the same group  we always have a clean, comfortable room.

<Content>Hmmm, not great The rooms are tiny! Our bathroom was something out of the ark, saw no evidence of any renovation programme and would not consider eating in the hotel as the restaurant was very dirty. The staff on the front desk were totally not interested but the maid service for the rooms was very good. The lifts took forever (we were on the 12th and 14th floors) and the pool was very clean. Considering how cheap the hotel is and how close it was to the beach, a lovely park and Kalakaua Avenue, then overall it was ok.

<Content>Queen Kap- good on a budget. The Queen Kap was good on a budget. Clean but in need of updating. You only be in the room to shower and sleep. 1 Block to the beach. Parking garage. You can walk Wakiki easily. Close to other main highways. Walking path across the street for morning exercise. If you want pampered or luxury, stay elsewhere. Clean, safe and within walking distance of beach.

<Content>Love Hawaii for Less Money The pros were the cost, the location, the view. It was great to be in Hawaii. We wanted to keep costs low. We had a very reasonable package that included the Queen. It is not ritzy however, it is comfortable and I felt safe. We got a can of lysol to freshen it up a bit, but I do that at all hotels. The location was right across the street from the beach and all beach/downtown attractions were in easy walking distance (and I'm not the athletic type). Also, most of the tours will pick you up at this hotel. The view was great as we ate delicious pancakes with all of the fixings at the hotel restaurant and enjoyed the breath taking view of Diamond head. It is no where near being an exclusive hotel, however, if you are looking for safe, comfortable, accessible, and super price, IT CAN'T BE BEAT!

<Content>First time in Waikiki! The reviews sum up this hotel - needs refurbishment as it is a bit tatty and tired!! But generally nice hotel with nice and helpful staff!But it is 2 minutes away from Waikiki Beach so the location is great! Although there are shops and restaurants near by, you can end up walking a while trying to find the one you want - except the ABC store which is everywhere!There is a bus stop right outside the hotel so you can get the bus easily to a lot of places. We tried to get the bus to Hanuama Bay at 8am but it was packed by the time it got to our stop so instead we got a shuttle cab.

<Content>Take your ear plugs We have just returned to the UK from a two week stay at the Queen Kapiolani, and it was pretty much what we expected after reading a few reviews.It is in need of refurbishment , it really does look tired and out dated.The room we were given on the Penthouse floor was the smallest double room I have ever seen, so we payed extra to upgrade. We ended up in room 510 on the fifth floor, a spacious double aspect room with a nice balcony overlooking Diamond Head and the sea on the other side. The view was wonderful.Bathroom was not bad, towels changed daily and kept clean by housekeeping.The TV was very old and they really should update them.Now the bed was terrible, the floor was more comfortable, if you like HARD beds you will be OK, we don't.....never mind.the BIG BIG problem was the noise, we might well have been on the street, there are two nightclubs close by and it gets very noisy when they leave (lots of shouting and argueing). There is a car park directly in front of the hotel which attracts youngsters cruising with large music systems booming.The traffic noise is really loud, worse were the waste disposal trucks every night (or early morning).The rooms need double glazing, it is all very nice having a lot of natural light and great views but it is not practical. We could only sleep wearing ear plugs we kept from the Airline (thank you Virgin).I nearly forgot the Air conditioning unit....truly ancient and too noisy to use.Let us be positive for a minute, The reception staff were very helpful and polite, (special thanks to the ever smiling and helpful Shane).Trying to get breakfast at the hotel was almost impossible!The first time we tried the witress only gave us half our order, we had to keep reminding her of this and that she kept forgetting, it was a dead loss so we jumped in a cab and ate at the Wailana coffee house (great food), but we tried breakfast at the hotel on our last day as it was convenient, unfortunatly the watresses were more interested in chatting amongst themselves, we were the only people in the place, what's more they seemed surprised when we walked out after being ignored for five minutes or more.There are much much better places to eat.Would we stay there again? No has to be the answer.I really don't know why someone does not buy the hotel and make it the 'Hilton' with the fantastic Diamond Head view.But you get what you pay for. Happy holidays.

<Content>Great location but noisy Stayed in Oceanview Kitchenette on almost top floor with great view of both Diamond Head and Ocean from Balcony. Room had a king bed and plenty of room and was a little worn but its just a place to sleep. the staff were friendly and helpful.My only complaint is that the room was noisy from the streets mainly due to the windows only having louvers that could not be closed fully. Great for air flow but should be changed to closable windows. We slept with earplugs. Note not all rooms had louvers though. We did not request a change as the view was so great but perhaps we should have as the hotel was far from fullOverall the hotel was in a good location at the end of Waikikki very close to the beach and parks and zoo. Ask for a room woithout louvered windows, I will next time.

<Content>Shabby and Dated Stayed two nights here in June 2008. Was told that I had been upgraded when I checked in only to find that my room was old, dated and very worn (can't imagine what I'd have gotten had I not been upgraded). Furnishings were old and in disrepair; the carpeting in poor shape. Bathroom was even worse - the tub was very old and dirty; the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling off. Both the room and all of the common areas of the hotel are in a desparate need of updating. Staff were, at best, aloof. The only bright spot was the restaurant. While the surroudings of the restaurant were also in need of an update, the staff were very friendly and the food (at least for breakfast anyway) was very good and very, very resonable. Next time I'm in Honolulu, I'll spend a few extra dollars for a nicer, newer room somewhere else.

<Content>old, but decent I stayed at the Queen Kap for my weeklong vacation in Oahu. My first impression was that it was old and could have used new carpets and a paint job- especially in the hallways, but our room was clean and large enough for 3 people. The AC (very important in Hawaii!) worked well and the maid did a great job of cleaning our room each day. There was a mini fridge, but no microwave, which would have been useful. There was also no computer access. The bathroom looked recently renovated though. I'd definitely recommend booking a room with a view. Our's looked out to the hostel next door so we had to keep our curtains drawn most of the time. The best thing about the Queen is its location. It's close to the beach and the main strip, which makes shopping and finding food easy, but since it's not on the main street it's much quieter and feels safer as well. The staff were competent, but weren't very friendly. However, we had our Lonely Planet and Fodor travel books so we really didn't need their help. While the hotel offers parking for a fee, there's a street nearby that has free parking and is about 5 min walking distance to the hotel. The Queen Kap was a good find and is definitely worth the price.

<Content>Great Value, Great Location I have stayed at this hotel three times already. The staff were always eager to help about local hot spots and how to get there. The views from the room are ok if you get a partial ocean view room. The rooms were a little cramped and dated, but cleaned and vacumed every day and the balcony was nice to hang wet beach towels and wet swim trunks out to dry. In the mornings you awake to hear the zoo animals accross the street making their morning noises which I liked hearing. Basically you know what you're paying for in advance, you are not gonna get Filet Mingon delivered to your room when you pay 80 dollars a night. I would recomend this hotel if you want to spend your money on other things like sight seeing,snorkeling,and gifts I mean lets face it how much time are you really gonna be in your room, you're in HAWAII.

<Content>A room with a View.... For less than 100.00 a night. I paid 88.00usd a nightOn the 15 floors with a Diamond Head  Ocean View room.My room was very Quiet ... No Street noise or elevator shaft noise.Clean and comfortable but we have to admit the hotel will need a Facelift as soon as possible.We went to the restaurant and the pool and find it OK but not moreBut again remember we paid 88.00 a night in Waikiki in front of the Diamond Head and the Ocean ... two minutes walk to the beach... one minutes walk to the Zoo.... Sunset on the beach for a free movie ... Great restaurants (CheeseCake factory, Top of Waikiki鈥? Shore Bird, Duke).... By the way I also stayed at the Outrigger Reef so I could compare a 300.00usd a night with an 88.00usd a nightYou have for what you paid for.Denis

<Content>Needs new WINDOWS!!!! My husband and I with 2 children went to much needed vacation this January, 2008. We liked the view from our room and everything was decent BUT at night we could not sleep. The room doesn't have solid windows -- they are a 2-inch glass blinds that do not block any noise and hotel located on a very, very busy street with a busy bus line. We all used earplugs but that did not help at all because the noise level was too high. The only sleep you can get was between 2am to 5am and that's it. I developed insomnia and I still have problems with my sleep 5 months later after so called vacation. We will never stay there again and warn others unless they do major remodel with changing windows to solid ones. Those glass blinds will only work in a very quiet location but there it seemed like we were sleeping on a very busy street.

<Content>You get what you pay for The hotel is old but I thought it was clean and tidy. We had a standard room which was very small (hard to get bags through the door - furniture prevented opening door fully). It is rather noisy but we slept with the air-con on so that blocked out most noise. It has the basics and is good value for money - very convienient  cheap. But you would only want to sleep here - not the sort of hotel you would sit back and relax in. Overall - good value for Waikiki but it's not a resort.

<Content>QUEEN KAPIOLANI - BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE LAST LEG OF OUR DREAM VACATION We stayed at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel from May 17-21 after a week on Maui and a week on the Pride of America inter-island cruise. We booked it because of the location and price as the hotel offers an airline discount. The new owners, Castle Resort Properties, need to invest some major $$$$$ in renovating this property. We were in Room 914 which had a wonderful view of Diamond Head; however, the noise from the traffic kept me awake every night. Also the room is near the elevator shaft so I heard the elevator going up and down all night. The pool is very clean and the restaurant had a nice breakfast menu. The location is great as you can walk to the beautiful beach, the zoo, the Waikiki Shell, International Marketplace, etc. But I will never stay there again unless they renovate it, nor would I recommend it to anyone. For the last leg of our dream vacation and 25th wedding anniversary, I was anticipating much better accommodations than what we had.

<Content>Good location, but unhelpful staff and noisy. The Queen Kap is in a pretty good location. Our room was clean and tidy. So no complaints there. But I would not stay in this hotel again. For one thing, the reception staff were unhelpful - after arriving in Hawaii at 11am from a long flight from Sydney, we were not able to check in until 3pm, despite pleas to the reception staff. The other thing I didn't like about the room was its louvre windows, wonderful for letting in air but woefully noisy.

<Content>Queen CRAPiolani - Avoid it at all costs I never ususually post on forums, but when I saw some of the lies about this hotel, I HAD to post . My hubby and I stayed at the Crapiolani for only 1 night prior to checking into our time share. It was the most horrible experience. I'm not some priss that needs a 5 star hotel, but this place was truly designed for nasty college students. The only upside was the concierge. They were really helpful. Other than that, the room was terrible. They even gave us one of their top floor suites. The tub had a brown ring around it, the water never got hot, the bed was hard as a brick, the sheets smelled funny, the carpet was wet in areas and clearly had never been cleaned. Plus, we had a room on the corner of the building with a great partial view of the ocean, but a full view into our neighbor's room. Furthermore, the window was right by the bathroom, and the dingy little curtain didnt cover the sides of the window. So our neighbors got to see us dart our of the bathroom in our towels. fun!Overall, nasty smelly place. Save your money. Dont think just cause' you're in Hawaii that you will spend more time out of the room vs. in the room. YOu still want a safe clean place to sleep. We also hear people complain of thefts while we were checking out.Never will I stay there again. Please take my word for it. It is not a nice little gem of a hotel. Its disgusting and should be turned into a hostel.

<Content>Tired but Comfortable The Queen is certainly past her prime. The whole place needs a new coat of paint. However, the rooms are neat and clean, the staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly, the location is excellent, and the price is hard to beat. The Zoo is across the street and the beach is about a block away.

<Content>Queen Kapiolani My husband was sent here on a business trip for 5 weeks. I joined him for 2 weeks. We had a diamond head view which was excellent. The zoo animals woke us up every morning. Much better than an alarm clock! The rooms were neat and the staff very friendly and helpful. The location could not have been better. We walked everywhere we needed to in the Waikiki area. Yes, the hotel is older, but it is very nice to stay in a hotel that is not part of a chain. We highly recommend that you stay here on your next visit to Hawaii!

<Content>Very satisfied First off, if you're on the vacation of a lifetime and expecting a resort experience, you'll be very disappointed with the Queen Kapiolani. It's a basic hotel in need of renovation, but with a great location and awesome views. We found the rooms to be clean and comfortable, with a refrigerator and basic amenities.We just needed one night as we were connecting out of Honolulu to Fiji the next day. We paid under $100 a night for a double with views of Waikiki, Diamond Head and the park, giving you the advantage of being within steps of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, yet feeling away from it all. We arrived a little before checkin time, and the staff was friendly and accommodating, getting us a room a little early. We had breakfast in the restaurant, and it was inexpensive and good. One caveat - there is no elevator from the parking lot to the lobby, so make sure you drop your bags off first, as well as any passengers who have mobility issues.Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again for a short stay - given the price, it's a great deal in Waikiki.

<Content>Great Ocean view! I had a standard ocean view room. It was advertised as 'small' but it was actually a good size for 1-2 persons. The hotel is pretty old but stately, room was very clean and staff was friendly. The location is phan tastic, 1/2 block from the ocean and right in the best shopping and eating area in Waikiki, next to the zoo and a park. Elevators did not seem slow, as suggested by other reviewers, I stayed way up high and never had a problem with the elevators. The room was very clean and had an absolutely gorgeous view of the ocean and green space. No lanai but a very large window. In room ac unit was pretty noisy but worked well. There is street noise, I am a very light sleeper and slept very well with ear plugs. If you stay there, check out the diving/snorkeling shop in the lobby, its chreaper for renting equipment than the other shops and the oner is really helpful. All in all, this is a very good value and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>OK It always amazes me how folks will choose a hotel for its price then complain when it isn't perfect.The Queens is a little old and showing its age, but then so are we.The important thing was that the room was as advertised and videoed and well taken care of, the pool was nice, and the attached restaurant had good food.The short walk to the beach was no problem even with my wife in a wheelchair, and the zoo across the street made for an interesting free day.It was well worth the price.

<Content>motel 6 with a great view I was a little scared about staying here due to the reviews. I am very picky about my room being clean and bugs, but our room was very clean and I saw no bugs. We stayed in room 1011 and It was very quiet and the view was amazing. we had a ocean view room and only paid $105.00 a night during pro bowl week.Make sure and book on their web site and check their specials and discounts. The pool was nice and clean with a great view.We ate at their restaurant once and it was okay for the price but we never did go back. The room looks like a basic hotel room at a motel 6 but for the price you cant go wrong as long as you get a upgraded room and stay away from a standard room. request a room on the upper floor 7 and up we did and they said they would do thier best which is all I ask. The bellboys and housekeepers were very nice. The two women behind the desk were fine. We were not planning to go to hawaii since we had gone last year at the same time but my minnesota vikings had 7 players in the pro bowl so we had to go ,but on a budget. I would stay here again but I do enjoy staying at hotels with at least 3 stars.

<Content>Great Budget Hotel, close to the beach. Would go back anytime. I stayed here for 1 night in January 2008 (arrived early for a package vacation at a different hotel). I was a little sceptical when I booked on-line, because I got my room for $80 on Expedia. Considering that most two and three star hotels in Waikiki were priced at over $150/night, I was not expecting much from this hotel. Upon arrival, I was pleasantly impressed.The rooms were clean, beds were comfortable, and bathroom well equiped. The furnishings were outdated, but if you just want a place that is close to the beach (one block) where you can sleep and shower for a decent price, this is a great place to stay. This is a non-smoking hotel.There is on-site parking ($15/day fee), a restaurant, gift shop, and activites desk.

<Content>No Aloha We stayed here and paid more to book an ocean view room. The side of the hotel we were given was on the alley side. Room 1010. Only a partial view with a building smack dab in front of us. Noise all night long in the alley from dump trucks to deliveries and people partying. We did find a bedbug so we're sure there were more. Air conditioner barely worked and the maid turned it off every day so we came back to a hot room. Hallways were sufficating. Slow elevators, construction of leaking building, no escalators working, no handicap access. No flexability with the desk personel on problems. We prepaid for our room and that was it. They just forget about you. They promised us an extended stay since we had a night flight, but reniged. Everything was an extra cost, even the coffee in our room. We won't stay here again.We knew it was an older hotel but it should be completely remodeled before charging people outrageous prices comparable to a newer hotel for nothing. If you stay here, don't forget we told you so!

<Content>Poor Service I chose this hotel because it was affordable and I needed somewhere to stay while my home was being fumigated. Service at this hotel was horrible. It seemed as if the front desk staff did not want to be there and it took a few minutes for the woman at the desk , Theresa to even acknowledge me and it seemed like it was an inconvenience for her to check me in. The was not friendly during my stay and the rooms were dated and in major need of renovations. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Hawaii.

<Content>Robbed (literally) I was browsing the internet and came along this site. Seeing I'm still infuriated by our stay at the Queen (my husband and I refer to it as Crapioloni) Kapioloni Hotel, I thought I would share. I know this was years ago, but I read a review where the same thing happened this past spring. Anyway August 2003-my husband is in the USAF serving in South Korea for 1 year (this was our first year of marriage). We decided to meet in Hawaii for a 6 day honeymoon. Our first night at Crapioloni, we were robbed. We went to dinner and were gone for an hour and a half. Came back and had to call the Hawaii 5-0. Manager could have cared less. It was totally an inside job. No damage done to the door and we were on one of the top floors. I made sure (through their insurance company) that we were reimbursed ! No apologies from staff or management. to the May 2007 entry-regarding also being robbed-you are not the first and unfortunately probably not the last.

<Content>No aloha We had a reservation for one night, but a situation arose and we couldn't use it. When we called to cancel the reservation, they refused, and not in an especially nice way. Where's the aloha? We live in Honolulu, and have been putting visiting colleagues up at this hotel for years, not because it is a desirable hotel but because it is cheap and convenient. Never again. Never again.

<Author>The Exhuberant Serindipidous Sojourner
<Content>Best Value! Stayed here 3 different times. So many people think you have to spend a lot of money to visit Hawaii...hogwash. We are in our 50's and just want a clean place to lay our heads and maybe have a view--this is the place! Get on the Queen K. club and the choice of rooms and prices are great. We always choose those corner rooms with a view of Waikiki Beach, Diamond Head and the zoo (also a pool view!) We stayed here in 1997, 2002 and 2007. Queen K. is so close to everything. We walked every morning to some place different. Yea, it is not the fancy-dancy Ritz, Hilton or Sheraton, but you are right there where the action is! As long as there are Queen K's in the world, we will never sign up for one of those time-shares-- just take their free gifts!

<Content>Great place to stay.... This hotel was a great place to stay for the money. We were upgraded to an oceanview room. You are at the end of the strip and away from most of the noise. The zoo is right across the street. We walked a mile to Diamondhead. Everything is close and the ocean was a wonderful sight to wake up to. The hotel is an older hotel, so don't expect much, but the staff was great in helping with anything we needed. Room was pretty small, and being on the 16th floor, the water pressure in the shower wasn't the best. We will be back to visit and we will stay at the Queen Kap.

<Content>Charming location for its price You can't beat the price for its proximity to the waterfront. It's no frills. Clean, compact and just everything I expected. Coming from Manhattan standards, this is just about the size of a studio apartment with 2 twin beds. I'm sure non-NY'kers are not going to be used to the $100 nightly rate.Wouldn't mind paying an extra $20 to stay next door at the Waikiki Grand rentals. It's right above Hula's Bar.

<Author>808aloha808
<Content>A former employee and guest I previously worked in the front office at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel a few years ago. The employees at the front desk have a guideline procedure that is very political. Like most hotels, they offer various room rates and work with numerous third party reservations. If you want to extend your stay at the hotel at a similar price, you need to book it through the 3rd party (Expedia, Choice Hotels, Travel Agent). The rude girl on the swing shift at the front desk is probably the supervisor (her name starts with a J) and has been there for many years. She occasionally will over react, due to experience from a previous occurrence and a stressful workload. Believe it or not, this girl can also be quite a sweetheart on slower paced days. Her experience is priceless and it is managements fault for keeping her on the front line with an overload of tasks.Prior to arriving at the hotel, I already had my set of expectation for the price that I paid. Basically, for a cheap price, I expect the mere essentials of cleanliness and safety. Whether in Las Vegas or Hawaii, I do not spend much time in the hotel room. Therefore I choose a low budget hotel as I only sleep and shower in the room.Overall, I was satisfied with my stay at the QKH. I would only recommend this place to someone who is on a budget without intentions of living in the room.--Aloha808--

<Content>Fantastic Vacation My stay was from Nov. 13, 2007 thru Nov. 18, 2007, The hotel was a mear 3 minute walk to the beach. My hotel room was clean and simple, so who cares, you hardly are in the room, because there is so much to do. The staff was very informative and helpfull. The hotel may not be as updated as the newer modern hotels but it was sure worth the money. All guests were quiet and courteous. I will surely go back to the QUEEN and even recommmend it to any one that wants to go to Hawaii!!!

Fantastic location, beautiful sunrise over Diamond Head, Kapiolani Park, Zoo, and Beach !! Careful of the wind blowing thru the lobby... can ruin a hairdo in 2 seconds flat. Would love to see the rooms get a little TLC, just because it was such a great place, it could be even better with a little TLC. Skip the restaurant.

<Content>Will stay there again! Just spent 2 nights at the Queen Kapiolani and we're so glad that we found this place. The location was perfect for us. We had attended a Jimmy Buffett concert at the Waikiki Shell and could just walk home afterwards. The room was on the 5th floor and we had a beautiful view of Diamondhead and overlooked the Honolulu Zoo. The tradewinds were blowing strong so the jalousie windows were a bit noisy, but we didn't mind at all. The people at the service desk were always quick to respond. They sent up a rollaway bed and extra pillows within minutes of our request. The parking was $15/day and we never had a hard time getting a space. The Garden Lanai Restaurant was a perfect place to have a relaxing, inexpensive breakfast. The location is excellent .... steps away from the beach, the zoo, Kapiolani Park, and the Waikiki Shell.

<Content>Great location The view and location were great; the hotel was deceptive and unresponsive. We had reserved the superior room per the virtual tour and when we arrived we had 2 twin beds pushed togethere and a folding cot with a thin sagging mattress. When we went back downstairs to the desk we were told that they do not gurantee their rooms; we asked that when another room was available to inform us, the Supervisor rolled her eyes. We had to really push to get the cot replaced, at first we were told nothing else was available; eventually it was replaced with a rolling twin bed.

<Content>Queen Kapiolani Location is the Kaps greatest asset if you want to be where the action is, a very short walk to Wakiki Beach. We stayed in the Mountain view with kitchenette (1219). It was roomy and kept very clean. The deck has a great view of Diamond Head, the zoo, park and a partial view of the ocean. Nothing to complain about there. It is an older place for sure, but they are trying to keep things nice.The staff is friendly and helpful. Unfortuately they were having elevator problems when I was there. Much waiting. Even used stairs 12 floors to speed things up. All in all it was a good experience and would be okay with staying there again.

<Content>Great place to stay, will return for sure. I am a travel agent from Toronto and stayed here for 14 nights in July 2007. The hotel is older but is clean, comfortable and is an absolute bargain for Waikiki Beach. The location is perfect, very easy to get to and from if you rent a car. A very short walk to the heart of the beach and there is every type of store that you may need within a block or two. If you are looking for a luxury 5 star then stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village but if you want to save about $250/night, this is great. Try to get a room facing Diamond Head, we were on the 17th floor and the view of the ocean and volcano were breathtaking. City view rooms definately don't have the view.Don't be afraid of some of the negative comments, I have been in many, many hotels around the world and would have no problem staying here again.

<Content>Would not recommend this hotel, small rooms and the hallways smelled I would not recommend this hotel unless you really don't care about staying somewhere very cheap. When I booked this place, I thought to myself, Oh this is probably like a normal average hotel, 2 queen beds, it should be fine. I was completely wrong! (I actually went with a group of friends to Hawaii, so we had the pleasure of getting to see 4 of this hotels rooms.)This was worse than an average hotel. One of the floors we stayed on (which was the sixth floor) smelled. We could not get 2 queen beds for the cheapest price, it was a king bed, but the king bed was 2 single beds pushed together so you couldn't sleep in the middle without falling in the crack. This room was very small. Another room that my friend stayed in was on the 5th floor at the end of the hallway, and they must have crammed as many rooms as they could into the end of the hallway, because instead of there room being a normal room, it was an L shaped room with one queen bed, and a single bed turned the other way to fit into the L part of the room. The room was SO SMALL AND SO RIDICULOUS!!! My other friends stayed in an Upgraded Oceanview room which was on the 11th floor, this was an actual normal room and had a really nice view of the zoo and ocean. The lobby and gift shop of this hotel are very nice, the elevators are SUPER SLOW!!! If you want to stay cheap here, don't do it!!! At least upgrade in price. I would NEVER stay here again or recommend it.

<Content>Great for the Price Ok, so it is really outdated and yes, some of the wallpaper is peeling and the carpet has some stains on it, but who isn't expecting this when you have a hotel a block from the beach at such a cheap price? I came in knowing i just wanted a place to sleep and nothing fancy, and thats exactly what i got. We got upgraded to an oceanview for free (didnt have to ask) and the bathroom was very clean, along with the rest of the room. The restaurant downstairs is nothing to write home about, but its ok and very convenient and not expensive like most hotel restaurants. The parking is $15 and sometimes it fills up, but they will just double park the cars and there is always someone on duty to move them when you need, so its not a big deal. My only complaint is the windows. They have like shutter style windows, so no matter how tight they are closed, you can still hear everything cuz of the little cracks. All in all, very pleased with our stay. You just have to go in knowing what youre getting and not expecting luxury resort style accomodations.

<Content>good deal for the money We just returned from an 8 night stay at the Queen. Overall, we had a nice stay. The previous reviews that I had read led me to believe that the hotel was basically a good deal, but with a few peoblems. Well, I agree with that assesment. The hotel was fine, but definately a bit worn from age. Our room, which was an upgraded corner kitchenette, was fine for the money. We had a great view of Diamond Head and the ocean. The kitchen area is small, but we never cooked anyway, so that wasn't a problem. The room was very clean, and we had great maid service every day. Our windows all opened up for a breeze, which we kept open during the day. We had to use the air conditioning at night due to the fact that the apartment building next door is so close that my wife was uncomfortable with the thought of people on their balconies being able to look in on us. One of the negatives that other reviewers mentioned was slow elevators, but we never found that to be the case. Also, people mentioned dirty hall floors, but again we didn't find that to be true in our hallways ( the 7th and 5th floors). The kids rooms were fairly small, but fine for the $73 a night that we were paying. I found the restaurant to be okay- the food was of a diner quality, but fine and reasonably priced. The bell desk was very friendly and helpfull. I had a bit of a problem with one of my rooms checking in, but after that there were no problems with the front desk. They replaced all of the lobby furniture right before we left, so maybe they are starting to spruce the place up . All in all, a nice place for the money, with a great location. We would stay again.

<Content>If you want basic, this is it! Hotel is pretty old that needs updates, but the room we got was clean. The room's got individual aircon units that can be noisy. Parking is $15 per day and parking space is limited and slots are tight. Overall, if you do not plan to stay in the room for most of the time, this will suffice. Beach is just a block away and Starbucks is right in the corner. Hotel was the cheapest I got when I was reserving. If you want a better hotel, you can book one right in front of the beach but its going to cost you. For location, cost, condition, the hotel is not a bad place to stay.

<Content>Nice hotel I booked this hotel because I didn't want to spend that much on a hotel. We stayed for 8 nights. The location is excellent, 1 block to the beach, near tons of stores, places to eat, and right across from the zoo. The room was very basic, the staff was very friendly. The resturant in the hotel was also good, not expensive at all  the staff there are also very friendly. My complaint is that the water in the shower wouldn't stay at the temp you put it on when you got in, sometimes it got really hot  sometimes it would get really cold. The room didnt have a mini fridge in it, which was great. On our last night there, my boyfriend had some bumps on him that he said were itchy, after reading another review it looks like someone else had the problem with bed bugs. I didn't get bit though. The maids were also very friendly. Overall the hotel was a good choice, cheap price, great location  super friendly  helpful staff. There is also a gift shop in the hotel where they sell food  drinks as well.

<Content>Just okay..for a night. If you want something that :-Costs $109 with tax and you get a semi ocean view with a VERY VERY basic room.-Is located 2 blocks to the beach but resides in a crap neighborhood-Is really, really old and rundown. (I cannot emphasize RUN DOWN enough here.) **************This may be the hotel for you.It doesn't smell..at least our room didn't.The pool area was quite dirty.It's just basically... pretty depressing.PLUS, it is located at the FAR end of Waikiki Beach, where you will find alot of the undesireables hanging around.Walk far on the beach, about equivalent to 5 blocks, to get to a better area.If your last stay was in a hostel, this will be a step up for you (in some cases)If require just an overnight stay like we did, this is okay, but you can do better at the Park Shore.

<Content>Nice stay This was a pretty nice hotel. The location was great and very convenient. The amenities were nothing fancy, but definitely adequate. We got a balcony that overlooked the city and ocean and a sizeable bathroom; I couldn't really ask for more. This is definitely not a luxury palace, but I doubt anyone booking this hotel expects that!

<Content>Can't recommend either Very old hotel, elevators are slow and sometimes hot when the fan isn't working. They gave me a tiny room which was hard to move around in. I was able to venilate the room by opening up the venetian window panes and using the air conditioner to circulate cool air. Parking was a nightmare, even though you can park yourself there usually wasn't any spaces so you had to double park and leave your keys with the attendant. One night the attendant told me to park upstairs but there were no parking spaces so I parked on the hotels driveway ramp (not blocking the ramp) where other cars were also parked, they had the nerve to give me a parking warning slip.I don't think I be staying here anymore.

<Content>Gorgeous view - reasonable rates We booked an Oceanview Suite and it didn't disappoint us. We stayed here before leaving on a cruise in room 1518 and returned after the cruise to room 1718 (they upgraded us from the Oceanview room we had originally booked)Our taxi deposited us in the open air registration area which was very plain in appearance. The two clerks at the desk were friendly and courteous. The bellman was very cordial and took us via their antiquated but servicable elevator to the fifteenth floor of this nineteen floor building. The elevator doors opened to reveal an average but clean corridor with carpet which showed age, but you would too if you were cleaned frequently, dripped on by chlorinated swimsuits, and lived in the tropical climate. Our room was spacious with several alcoves to add more space. The entrance alcove also had a dresser and plenty of space for our seven pieces of luggage. The second alcove was the kitchenette with sink and garbage disposal, double glasstop stove burner unit, microwave, coffeemaker, small refrigerator, cookware, and dinnerware. The bathroom sink and Corian vanity was in a third alcove with a door which opened to the toilet and tub. It was supplied with a hair dryer and heavenly smelling soaps and lotion. This alcove also had a large closet with sliding mirror doors, and hid the room safe and ironing board with iron. The main room had a king bed with very comfy, near new Serta mattresses and two nightstands. There was very ample space to walk around the bed. The unit appeared to have been recently wallpapered in a neutral color and there was newer ceramic tile flooring in the bathroom. The drapes also appeared fairly new. The carpet was pale, but it was white sock clean! The room was fresh smelling, especially since the entire hotel is NON-smoking. Some have commented on the noisy air conditioner but it wasn't any noisier than other hotels with room units.If you have been a little disappointed by the room, just open the door onto the lani. Ahead of you is a drop dead gorgeous view of Diamond Head, Waikiki beach, and the ocean. Isn't this why you came to Hawaii? Below you across the street is the Honolulu Zoo and Kapiolani Park which has weekend activities. A drawback to this is the noise of the zoo birds at 5 AM but it's the price you pay for the location, location, location. You are only a block from the beach. You will probably want to get up anyway to see the beautiful sunrise over Diamond Head. Venturing downstairs to the main lobby, you will find a large open area in pale colors. If you are expecting a large waterfall or massive crystal chandeliers, you will again be disappointed. What it does offer is groupings of comfortable chairs and sofas where a group can gather to visit or wait for tour buses. The lobby also has several gift shops including one where you can pick up snacks and beverages. The restaurant and lounge are located on the third floor. It tropical decor does look a little dreary, but makes up for it with good food, cordial servers, and reasonable prices. If they aren't busy, several of the waiters will entertain you with simple tricks such as moving an egg from one glass to another without touching it. This is a real hit with kids. The lounge has happy hour from three to five and gives you a basket of popcorn with your drink (that may not sound like much, but to get anything FREE in Hawaii is a biggie). Just outside the restaurant is the swimming pool if you prefer chlorinated, crystal clear water to swim in rather than salty ocean water.If you are looking for rooms like the Hyatt or Hilton at Super 8 prices, stay home. You aren't going to find it anywhere in Hawaii. But if you are looking for a decent hotel at reasonable rates in a great location, Queen Kapiolani is your place. One more thing, be sure to take advantage of their special discounts listed on their website. It will make this hotel stay even sweeter and you will easily be able to overlook any shortcomings you might encounter.

<Content>Not recommended This place is old and rundown. The hallway smelled odd. Our room, on the 7th floor looking inland, was large but the bed was two twins pushed together. The bathtub faucet had a steady drip. The sound of that might have kept us from sleeping if it hadn't been drowned out by the AC. There was a small fridge in the room, but there wasn't much else complimentary about the place.The best thing about our stay there was the friendly servers at the 3rd floor restaurant. Those were perhaps the lumpiest seats I've ever sat on, but the food was pretty good.Being by the zoo didn't bother us. The sound proofing between the walls, however, wasn't very good and we could hear conversations pretty clearly from the next room.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful We stayed at the Queen Kapiolani for 8 nights, and I would highly recommend it to anyone going to Honolulu. It is located right across from the zoo, but, we only heard the birds 2 mornings long after we were up. The view from our lanai was beautiful, we could see the flamingos in the pool at the zoo, Diamond Head was in full view and we could also see the ocean. The rooms were very clean, and the staff was super. Everyone was so friendly. The hotel is 1/2 a block from the pier, taking about 3 minutes to walk there. I was skeptical about staying here, because the price was really reasonable, but it was great. We are going back in 2 years and plan on staying at the Queen we we go back.

<Content>Not impressive We liked the location of this hotel but that is about it. The carpet was dirty and coming up in areas so bad that the door hardly shut. The bathroom was dirty with mold in the shower. We only stayed one night thank goodness. We payed to much for the room, the pool is only open 9am -6pm and parking is an extra $15 a day.

<Content>Terrific place to stay! I took my mom to Hawaii for her 50th birthday (not a completely altruistic gift...I was the one that got to accompany her!) We decided to save money and stay in an okay hotel rather than blowing a lot of money on someplace we'd only see while sleeping.The Queen Kapiolani blew my expectations out of the water. The staff were beyond friendly and were very accomodating when my mom had to check in before me (flight snafu), despite the room being on my credit card. Our room was great - nice size, clean, comfortable. I would recommend springing for a private balcony. We were on the 18th floor with our own balcony and had a view of downtown, the mountains, and the ocean. We spent many early mornings out there watching the city awake.The location is fantastic - just steps away from Waikiki beach. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel that has major lines come through (I'd recommend getting around on foot or via bus rather than renting a car if you are just staying in Honolulu). There are lots of stores and great restaurants nearby.I am a very well-traveled individual and have stayed in hotels all around the world, from the very best to the very worst. Next time I go to Honolulu, I will definitely stay at the Queen Kapiolani again!

<Content>Avoid this hotel if you have another choice I did not want to put that star but the system require to put at least one, anyway here is my storyWe booked this hotel through expedia after I read the review in TA, basically what I was looking for is a clean hotel near everything for sleeping only, neither me nor my wife are picky in anything, but here what we found in room 903:1- As we did not plan to stay anytime we did not care about the view, so we booked cheapest category by CAD 97/night plus expedia fees which I consider way too much of what it really worth.2- Needless to say wear and tear is everywhere, but this do not mean much to us, but it is also unclean that we never feel comfortable to use the washroom unless putting tissue everywhere. Or walk with bare foot.3- Noise was incredible although we were in the 9th floor, there is no way you can close the window as they were not working, and it was not only road noise but also looks like the were garbage tube near our room, and they keep throwing garbage all the night to extend that you hear bom bom all the time5- You may ask why you did not ask for changing the room, I will say who want to waste time in the paradise, and thank god it was only two nights.6- expedia gives us vouchers for breakfast and aloha bag, we did not get either simply because the front desk person were so unhelpful and said we have to redeemed that through expedia person by ourselves, and that person only work from 8am to 4 pm, time we never be in hotel. We asked another front desk person the next morning to pass the printed voucher to him and put the redeemed in our room, what was the result? He just through the paper away and we did not get anything, and lost the papers.7- In these two days we dealt with 4 front desk persons, all of them are so unprofessional8- I'm so regret that I did not pay couple more dollars and stayed in another place.Please excuse any grammar or spelling errors, e-mail me if you have any question

<Content>Can't get any worse then this! This was THE worst hotel I've every stayed in, and I'm not a hotel snob! There is a difference between and old hotel with charm and an old run-down hotel, this was definetly the later! The bathroom was awful. There was mold on the walls in the shower, the linoleum was peeling on the floor, the bathroom door was cracked and peeling. The shower faucet dripped and we had to sleep with the bathroon door closed so we wouldn't hear it. the rug in the bedroom was filthy! Even the closet smelled like mold. The linai had two very old chairs I dare not sit in for fear they would colapse, the paint was peeling and the sink was rusted and drippy. You know the saying, you get what you pay for? well we didn't even get that. I'd rather stay at a hotel 6 then this place again. The two good things were the location, one short block from the beach, the far end of Waikiki, and the bellboys were all very nice. There are plenty of other places to stay for just a little more money, but well worth it. I hope this review saves the next traveling family!

<Content>Very poor customer service I stayed at this hotel from 4/16-4/21. Having read the reviews I was confident I'd be comfortable there since I wasn't looking for anything fancy  several reviews stated that the staff was very helpful. I couldn't disgree more.When I first arrived the hotel only had me staying for one night and had me wait over an hour until they resolved the problem. When I approached the lady at the front desk to inquire about my situation she would walk away leaving me mid-sentence. They didn't apologize for their mistake  acted like it was my problem.The next day I couldn't get into my room, for whatever reason the key wasn't working  again I encountered the same attitude.On my last day I asked if they had a courtesy room for guests who have late flights, friends I went with had this option at their hotel. The attendant was very sarcastic in her response and said no, maybe at other hotels where you pay more.The bed was like sleeping on a rock  the noise level at night was almost too much. After reading the reviews on this hotel I went there with an open mind  a positive attitude, but was terribly disappointed  wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>great location and good value We were pleased with our stay at the Hotel Kapiolani. It was only $83a night and for that price, it was clean, the location was great, thepool area was very nice as well as the lobby. We stayed only 2 nites,but it was just what we wanted for the extra time in Hawaii. You can walk one block and you are at the major Waikiki beaches and shops. It is not luxurious, but I would stay there again.

<Content>queen kap has personality I just returned from a 5 day stay in hawaii with my family. We stayed at the queen kapiolani and I have to say that after reading several reviews over a 2 month period I was very leary of the place. I was however surprised to find out that all of the negative comments were very untrue. The hotel is old but it has a personality all of its own. To renovate this hotel would take away the true meaning of the queen.Maybe just a little paint would help it look a little better. The rooms were very comfortable and the view of the beach was beautiful from our superior city view room. I did not see one bug and the carpet was not worn. The air conditioner worked just fine. The only comments that i found to be true was that the elevators are sparatic. They do stop on the wrong floors. The other is that the food is not so great. Other than that, don't believe all of the horror stories u hear. Be more concerned with the horrible hospitality of the locals. They are not willing to help.So if you have any doubts, please be assured that at least on the 17th floor the rooms are fine and not run down. Spend your money on the things to do in oahu and not on expensive places like the marriott when all you do is sleep in the room.

<Content>1 word, Nasty! I stayed at the Queen for a week and I use term queen loosely, the rooms are very old and need to be seriously updated, I found it to dirty and the rooms smelled. Thank goodness for the AC which took the smell out of the room. My recommdation is spend some more money and stay some place better especially in Waikiki where the choice is endless. Thios hotel is named after a Queen and I think it shows disrespect for someone that was so stately. If I were to return to Hawaii it would not be to someplace so old and dumpy. I didn't like the Hotel at all and it really would have been a better trip if I had made a different decision. I don't blame the hotel it was after all my decision that I didn't make lightly. So in a nutshell, please stay somewhere nicer and don't belive all the pictures because they don't tell the whole story.

<Content>You get what you pay for My husband and I just got back from a 4 night stay at the Queen Kapiolani, we had a 9th floor Ocean view corner room with a beutiful view of Diamond Head and the east end of Waikiki beach, right accross from the zoo. The room was nothing to write home about, bed was a two twins pushed together, the furnishings were old and the windows were the old slat windows with no screens (thank god there's no mosquitos in Hawaii). The ants were quick to find any grains of suger spilled from making coffee. For the price, the location and view were great, so its hard to complain about the dated decor. The staff was great. If you are a light sleeper , bring some ear plugs cause the buses turn around in the alley below the room and the noise goes right through the slat windows, and sometimes the birds squauk and lions roar at the zoo.If you're like us and don't want to spend much time in your room, and don't love crowds, its really a pretty good deal, a short block to the Ocean, and not that close to the more crowded shopping end of Waikiki, but still close enough to walk to resturants and shopping if you wanted to. We rented a car the whole time we stayed here, so we basically just slept in the room.

<Content>great hotel-great location We have just returned from two weeks in Oahu spent at the Queen Kapiolani,and we loved every minute of it. The hotel is in a fantastic location,and we had stunning views of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach from our 18th floor room.Our room was spotlessly clean,and the maid service excellent. The elevators were a bit erratic,sometimes arriving at a different floor to that requested,but we were in no hurry anyway. I would definitley stay here again,and would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone planning a holiday in Oahu.

<Content>Its a tired but gracious Queen So many folks have poo-pooed the Queen and I found it to be charming. Certainly it is not the Halakulani but it is not 600 per night either. Expedia rates it as a 2 star but it is not even rated. I found it to be just as good as a 4 star hotel in Mexico. In fact, I think it is the best not rated 2 star hotel I have ever stayed in my life! All of the employees were wonderful. Parking was charged but that it common at Honolulu hotels. We ate at Lulus on the corner by the beach almost every day. The resturant at the hotel was good, not great, but affordable. Lulus had the best fish sandwiches I ever had for lunch. We were accross the street from the zoo, facing Diamondhead and when the animals sang out we felt like we were in Borneo. Very cool. Cannot recommend the whale watching or the sunset dinner cruise. They pack you in like cattle and the great food that they advertise was pretty poor. More like meow mix. You have been warned. Spent Sat. morning at the swap meet at Aloha stadium and spent 500. on a ton of stuff that would have cost 2 to 3 times more at the international marketplace or other places on Wakie-wakie. Hawaii is so cool...wish I could live there. Never wore my slacks once...always shorts and a aloha shirt. I think it would be wise to pony up for a delux or kitchenette room. Large and you can make your own coffee and drinks and snacks. We got a flight from Chico to SF to Honolulu with 7 nights at the Queen Kapiolani and a Bright red Mustang convertable for 1860. bucks. I thought that was preeeety COOL.

<Author>HawaiiDaydreams
<Content>Great location for so many things...BUT We stayed here for 2 wks. in June/July 2006. It isn't the fanciest of hotels. But the location was perfect for us. Concerts at Wakiki Shell,the Zoo,Kapiolani Park, the Pier, protected lagoon and open reef for fantastic snorkelling, Movies on the beach, South end of Wakiki Beach and the Queen's Surf all within a short stroll. I used to spend an hour snorkeling in the lagoon each morning while everyone else got an extra few zz's. Lots of assorted fish in the lagoon , but early morning was low tide, tried the open reef one morning-bad idea, tons of fish but between waves came close to shredding myself on the reef coral.Conveniance store,water rentals are in the main lobby, with a cheap conveniance store that has a bit of everything just 3 doors down. Pete the concerge can arrange almost any type of tour you could ask for and the pickup for most tours is just around the corner . Great view of Diamond Head from the pool or from the restaurant, I used to get a seat facing the crater for breakfast every morning. The lower end of the main drag is just a stones throw from the front entrance. City buses stop out front,trolly service to the mall and other stuff is just around the corner. Sheets are clean and rooms are airconditioned, almost perfect as a place to crash for the night. BUT... we had huge cockroaches in our room. At least one every night, and several times we had small lizards in our room. I complained,switched rooms, same problem. I eventually found that the weather stripping around the airconditioner was missing, leaving a gap large enough for a small bird to get in or out. Also killed 2 large cockroaches in the hall leading to the restaurant and told the front desk, 3 days later they were still laying on the carpet. Generally the staff are friendly and helpfull, but when I complained about the insects at checkout I was given a halfhearted Sorry that sounded more like here's a quarter, call someone who cares. Maybe they just get the same complaints daily, I don't know. Hope this is some help to someone. Maybe you could call ahead before booking re:the bugs. Without them, this would be my ideal spot to stay. Finally- for real authentic Hawaiian food that the locals line up for..out the front entrance turn left (away from the beach). About a 30 min. walk (not sure how long by car-about 2 miles) will bring you to ONO's, very small place. If you can see Kentucky Fried across the street you're in the right area.

<Content>Affordable Waikiki Hotel Queen Kapiolani is an old hotel but not too run down, yet. Location is great, right across from the zoo/park and nice view of Diamond Head. Beach is block away. parking is $15/day in a tight garage but we always found a space. Easy to get to from the H-1. Don't get off at an earlier exit like Vineyard or Kapiolani Blvd, you will be snarled in traffic forever. Take the King exit and it will take you straight to Kapahulu St. You are walking distance to many places to eat and shop too. It has some interesting historical paintings on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors. Check the one out of the Luau by the restaurant. It is old but it is kept neat and clean. Not bad for the price right near Waikiki.

<Content>Served it's purpose Stayed at QK from 2/10 - 17. I read the reviews here and was a little nervous to say the least. I'm a single mom and took this trip with my 6 year old. This is my third trip to Waikiki. Concerns posted here that I agree with: 1. the sheets definitely seem a little too small for the beds - but they make them everyday for you2. bugs - I did see a roach the very first day and called the front desk. they were prompt in responding and killed the bug and sprayed. I considered moving, but figured if they have a bug problem, then it's not just in my room. I didn't see any other bugs after that (and I did look). And I was sure to place all my food either in the fridge or in ziploc bags. Also, just because you don't see bugs at a more prestigious hotel, doesn't mean they don't have them. 3. worn carpet, etc - definitely worn down - but clean and just fyi - I've stayed at the Sheraton and the Marriott before and they suffer from the same problem (at least in the hallways)Best features of QK:1. inexpensive - I was able to spend the money that might have otherwise been spent on a hotel on many other activities 2. kind staff - they were really nice when I was there (again, no better and no worse than the Sheraton or Marriott which are 4x more expensive)3. Close proximity to the beach! - This cannot be beat! It's a short, safe walk to the beach at any time of day. 4. Easy in and out parking - while they do charge $15 for parking - it was worth it. Other's have reported that you can park across the street - but that is only for four hours at a time. To me it was worth the convenience of always having a parking spot. Even when they were full - they would valet the car. You pull out onto Kapahula which can drop you right onto H1. 5. the ABC store next to the hotel is cheaper than all the other ABCs stores on the strip (I kid you not)6. Tons of restaurants close by. Would I stay here again???? Sure. I'm not a fussy traveler, although I would appreciate a little nicer upgrade of furniture, etc. If you are high maintenance and need/want super nice accommodations, then stay at the Marriott (they have the best beds and a great pool). If you are easy going and don't mind the place being a little run down, then the QK is the place for you. You'll spend far less on a place to lay your head and be able to spend your money exploring the island. Best activities:Sea Life Park (you've got to swin w/the dolphins)Hanauma Bay (ask the park staff the best place to snorkel)Whale watching (Star of Honolulu)Luau (Paradise Cove)

<Content>The Place grew on us. Just got back from staying at the Queen. Arrived bout 7:30PM. and our first impression was not very good. The place looked old and run down. But the next morning and following days we came to really like the place. The restaurant served good food, was close to the beach, had a bus stop right next to it, and the Zoo. Nice and affordable.

<Content>A Queen for budget travelers My wife and I had been to Oahu before, so this time we wanted to spend less on accommodations and spend more on activities. After reading hundreds of reviews on Trip Advisor and Yahoo Travel, we decided on the Queen Kapiolani. We were not disappointed. Yes, the rooms are small, the hotel is old and somewhat run down, but it was clean. For our needs, it was perfect. We spent our days snorkeling, hiking, laying on the beach, shopping, going on booze cruises, etc, and used the room to crash at night and clean up before starting the next day. If you're traveling on a budget and want to make the most of your time in Oahu, the Queen Kapiolani may be what you're looking for. Tips:1. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant is average, but reasonably priced.2. San Souci Beach located across the street from the Honolulu Zoo (about 2 blocks away from the hotel) is a decent place to snorkel if you don't feel like driving to one of the better known places. We saw a good variety of sealife and the beach wasn't crowded. 3. Mai'tai Catamaran offers some great snorkeling and booze cruises. If you get a chance, the moonlight cruise on Friday evenings is the best. You get to watch the Hilton Hawaiian Village fireworks show from the ocean and it is amazing. Especially if you've taken advantage of the open bar.

<Content>Excellent value for location and view This hotel is old and needs renovation, but if you're looking for a cheap place to stay on Waikiki with a great view of Diamondhead and the ocean you cannot beat the Queen Kapiolani. All of the rooms have a lanai (balcony) so you can sit outside and enjoy the sunset and the beautiful view of Diamonhead Crater. The rooms are clean and comfortable, but nothing fancy. The location can't be beat either as you're near a main outlet (Kapahulu Ave)for waikiki allowing for easy access to the freeway or other side streets into the city. This hotel is also really close to the zoo and aquarium for alternative beach activities (aquarium is highly recommended!).

<Content>needs refurbishing We went for a conference to Oahu and stayed 5 nights at Queen Kapiolani. Since we had already paid for the rooms we did not want to search for a new hotel, but we were really suprised to see how old the hotel was. The carpet might not be new, but you would expect a bit more for the the bathroom. The sink and toilet seat was scratched. It was difficult to see whether the bathroom was clean or not.I have the feeling that there are different standards within the hotel. I was suspicious that they give better rooms to some of the guests. One thing I know, our room was not touched and reburbished since Humphrey Bogart's time.Aloha!

<Content>Hated the Queen Kapiolani Your Man Tours booked me here for the Kings Tour in Oahu. I do not recommend YMT or this hotel. The YMT guide put us on a shuttle bus from the airport that stopped at many other hotels around the city. It dumped us off at the curb out front of this hotel and left us to handle our luggage up the many stairs and into the Lobby. If you made a deposit it is worth loosing it. They leave the bathroom windows open with no screen whenever you leave your room. This practice opens the opportunity for bugs and rodents to get in. I woke up with my leg full of bedbug bites on the very first night. My daughter woke up screaming because there were red hard shell bugs in her bed between the sheets. The bathroom sink faucet handle came off in our hand. The carpet was duct taped to the floor. Our toilet water rose to the top (but didn't overflow) when the people next store flushed. The pool was not heated and the pool bottom was dirty. The view out of our room was the top of another buliding with beds on the roof. If this is how YMT treats the Kings guests I would hate to see the lesser classifications of tours. Don't be fooled by the pictures on the website or the hotel postcards.Location is great and rooms are spacious with hair dryer, refrigerator, iron and ironing board. Fee for using the safe.

<Content>Great Deal! I would stay here again. I visited Oahu in November (for the 5th time) and it makes me sad to read all the reviews about this hotel. People need to remember you get what you pay for. This is not a 5 star hotel. When I go to Hawaii I pay for the ocean, the food, and the wonderful people. We rarely stay in our room, only to sleep. I found the hotel to be old but clean and I never saw one bug. We were only one block from the beach and close to all of downtown. Our air conditioner worked fine and the bathroom looked clean and new. We payed more for the higher cost room and didn't hear a sound from our neighbors even though a large group of Japanese students was there the same time as us. The staff was very nice and helpful. The cafe was good and we even had our Thanksgiving Dinner there in the open cafe with Diamond Head in the background. It doesn't get any better than this. Was the carpet old and stained? Yes. Will that prevent me from going there again? No. PS..for those new to Hawaii almost all hotels charge you for the coffee in the room. We have learned to go to ABC and purchase our own.

<Content>no, no, no, no, no This place was built in 1969 and feels every bit that old. If you have to stay here, I would say you probably don't have enough money to come to Hawaii. It is not relaxing to stay in a place like this. The halls were dark and dirty. The walls were even dirty; the in-room carpet stained, old, and peeling up at the edges. Bathroom was clean. Others have mentioned how they charge for in room coffee ($1.30) and the fact the hotel does not use fitted sheets. However, the worst part was how LOUD it was. I could hear the tv and everything going on in the other room and all of the hustle and bustle traffic 15 floors below. The loud a/c actually helped drown out the street noise. Our room faced other hotel rooms, although we had asked for an ocean view and upgrade. The bell hop guy was not helpful, barely decent. The front desk person did not seem to want to help when asked about which rental car company he would recommend or if they could pick us up from the hotel. He told us to call the various companies. We did not try the restaurant; it looked like a Luby's circa 1981 with offerings such as hot dogs and $9 steak advertised.

<Content>Decent deal! My husband and I stayed at the Queen Kapiolani for four nights because he was running the Honolulu Marathon. If you're going to be doing the same, Queen Kapiolani is a good place to stay because it's literally across the street from where the shuttle bus picks you up in the morning before the marathon, AND where the marathon's finish line is. We had a superior city view room, which was mostly fine. When we got our room keys it does say on their envelope that the coffee in the room will cost you -- we went to the Food Pantry in Waikiki and bought our own coffee and filters, and that worked fine. Fridge was fine too, as was the AC, which we didn't use much (coming from Chicago, we wanted to soak in the heat!).My only major complaint would be that for some odd reason, the maids don't use fitted sheets on the beds. That meant we'd wake up to feel the bare mattress, with no sheet. If I were to stay there again, I might bring my own fitted mattress.Pool was fine, smaller than the artfully-cropped picture on their website suggests; it was also a little cold, but you can't really beat sunning yourself with a view of Diamond Head. We didn't try their restaurant.The hotel staff was friendly, called us a cab to get back to the airport, and let us stash our bags behind the bell desk when we had a couple of hours between checkout and our cab to the airport. All in all, I'd probably stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful trip Oct 2006 my hubby  I went to Oahu. This was my first trip, his 2nd. We stayed at the Queen Kapolani hotel in Waikiki. It is a budget hotel, the staff is very friendly  helpful. Don't expect lavish accomidations but being we didn't spend too much time in the room that was just fine  you can't beat the price. We were upgraded for free from the standard room, to a standard room w/ an ocean view  a queen size bed. It was an excellent view of Waikiki beach. We were on Oahu for the Oct earthquake and we were fortunate that the hotel had a very large back-up generator to run the elevator. They did have their kitchen open, wait for dinner was 1.5hrs! Not sure if we were just overly hungry  thought the food was good or if the food was good.We ate at LouLou's several times- very tastey. Highly recommend the banana macadamia nut pancakes! Dinner there only one night- food was great, service was a bit slow due to busyness. excellent view of the beach!Dukes down the strip was good- food nothing to write home about but the atmoshpere was worth the higher price. We hit Pearl Harbor in the afternoon and lucked out in getting on a tour- 2nd to last one for the day. Several guide books indicated we needed closed toed shoes- this was not true as many people had on flip-flops  sandles. PCC was awesome- definately worth the price for the ambassedor luau  seating at the horizon's show. OUrs was 2nd row just to the right of the stage. Get there when it opens (noon) so you can see it all. Don't go up  around the S coast road from Waikiki to Lie'a- speed is only 35 and takes longer than you think. The laundrett (laundry mat in Lie'a) was very clean  the owner was extremely helpful and friendly!Dole plantion was ok. Train ride was on the pricey side but it was a nice day. Chose not to pay to do the maze- should be free in mho. Their snack bar only has dessert like items- no meals. they do hit you up for a pix when you get on the train, we didn't want it and felt kinda pressured to buy.Halewia (N. Shore)- the grass skirt (or maybe brass skirt)- excellent food! Had the pulled pork sandwich - it was very tastey. Went to the Blue Hawaiian show- Elvis impersenator- good performance- dinner portion was ok. Swap meet great place for inexpensive gifts...cheaper than international market. Go to inter'l market first for ideas  prices.Pearl stands- the pearl is pretty inexpensive to get, it's the settings that cost you. Each setting gets you another chance at a pearl. We had 3 oysters w/ 4 pearls- setting 3 pearls. We finally had to stop. Quality of pearls is nice- I enjoy wearing them and got a good memory out of it too.Flew ATA- it is a budget airline, we'd probably fly them again. The lines to check in were extremely long in HNL- you have to have your bags screened by the agriculture group prior to checking in. Alamo Rental car- the night we got in their pc's were down  made check in very very slow (1hr+ wait). We did get a free upgrade as they were out of midsize cars. airport lei greeting- if you are getting in late don't bother. Entertainment coupons online- not really worth it from our standpoint. Only used 1 coupon.N Shore beaches- only for the really good swimmers. One week was definately not enough time to do it all. Lots of things we didn't get to see or do. Aloha!

<Content>Great, friendly staff We booked this hotel thru Orbitz for three nights following our cruise because Orbitz was having a 25 percent discount off hotel stay and because Fromer's review rated this hotel pretty decent. The location of the hotel was really good. The entire-staff were really friendly and helpful. The main floor for check in and waiting area was pretty and clean, except for the old elevators and the rooms. Stepping out of the elevator, you are greeted with a dark, muggy, stinky old hall way that leads to all the rooms. When we booked with Orbitz, we upgraded our room from $109 to $135 per night ( the 25% discount already included in the upgraded ) so we expected somewhat, a nice decent room. We were so disappointed when we saw our room. The beds were made, but the carpet was dirty and old, the T.V was really old and you would have to wait a good two minutes before the screen is cleared. The tiny refrigerator under the T.V' cabinet was barely cold, the bathroom was clean but old with cracks. The A.C was on and was running like a wrecked-train. We had to turn it off at night so that we can get some sleep. Our upgraded-room 'did not give us a great view either. We had the curtain closed most of our stay because our room was facing all the other hotels' occupants. To add insult to the injury, they provided a coffee-machine, but charge $1.50 for a bag. We called Orbitz and complaint. They told us to call the front desk. We called the front desk, they said one, for that price, that is the best room they could give to us, and two, they don't have any room left. The bottom line is, maybe for $135 a night, we got what we paid for, but perhaps, maybe for $135 a night, we may got a better, cleaner room somewhere else than at this hotel.

<Content>Would NEVER Stay There Again I booked this Queen as part of a package from Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays. The flight (Delta) was packed but ok. The room at the Queen REEKED of mold. We couldn't get another room, they claimed to be 100% full (actually, they told us they always overbook 3-5%).I took apart the air conditioner, cleaned out a bunch of black fungus/mold and bought a can of Lysol at ABC store for $8.It helped a little, but not much.I called Pleasant, they claimed they couldn't help me and that I was better off at the counter.If you stay here, remember you're paying $50/night in a $150 neighborhood and that the facility is old, moldy, overbooked, and that they don't have much for customer service.By the way, I think Pleasant Holidays is off my list too becase of their complete lack of support.

<Content>Worth the Money I went there with my friend in September to celebrate the beginning of fall :) Overall the hotel was nice. If you notice, when looking around for prices, most hotels nowadays are so expensive in Oahu that your choices become quite slim.The hotel is clean and pleasant. The room we were in was plain but again very clean and nice. The patio was also very nice. We had beach view.The people at Queen Kapiolani were friendly and very helpful. I guess that's the nature of Hawaiians. Whenever we needed some advice on where to go and what to see, everyone was SO responsive. They even sat us down and gave us directions.Again, the only downside is always price, and I noticed that to be even more true in Hawaii. We paid something like $115 per day (parking is paid too!!! - $5/day). And even that was a good deal so look around. I think I looked around 10 or 15 sites until I finally found the best deal at (--)

<Content>Great location and VERY friendly staff. Just returned from Hawaii and must say the Queen Kapiolani was one of the highlights of our stay.....Our room on the 15th floor had a view of Diamond Head and the ocean. Although it was across from the zoo we observed no unpleasant smells or noise. The restaurant has a great prime rib dinner for $9.50...one of the best values in Waikiki...the pool does close early but its no big deal. The carpet in the hallways is a little worn and stained, but the room was clean and airconditioned. The elevators were prompt and worked well. The staff was especially kind and helpful...The waiter in the restaurant was great fun. For the price and the location this can't be beat.....It was a bit strange to have to pay for in-room coffee,which is usually complimentary, but there is a Starbucks practically next door so who cares? We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Queen Kapiolani is hard to beat for value! When we booked a room at the Queen Kapiolani we had mixed feelings after reading some of the reviews, here on Tripadvisor. The first thing I noticed on entering the lobby was that it was somewhat dated. Dated it may of been but it was clean. It was immediately evident that there was a very relaxed and pleasant atmosphere that emanated from the guests and also from the the very friendly staff.  I was still a bit reserved as to how our room would be upon reaching it, as the initial appearance of the carpeting on the floor when exiting the elevator appeared as if it was wet. It wasn't! Apparently something at some point had made it look that way. Once again I realized it was just old carpet but never the less it was still clean.  When we finally opened the door to our room, it was not really unlike many other hotel rooms anywhere. It was not fancy, but it was comfy enough. I inspected the bathroom and again it was very clean. Not the most modern of fixtures, but it was clean.  It was dark when we arrived so we were not able to see the magnificent view right away, though we were able to make out the waves from the ocean, through the darkness. That in itself was pretty nice.  Now, it just so happens we were awoken on our first morning by a rare earthquake, measuring 6.7 on the Richter Scale. Being on the sixteenth floor the entire experience was quite dramatic to say the least. An experience my husband and two sons are not about to forget anytime soon. We sure had some stories to tell when we got back home. Even though it was raining on that first day , the day of the earthquake we realized, after we all settled down that we had a magnificent view of not only the ocean to our right, but directly in front of us there was Diamond Head, in all her glory. as clear and close as could be. In the days that followed we had some beautiful days and the views became all the more clear. Breathtaking is the only word to describe what we were priveledged to see each day we were there. Whatever reservations we may of had about the Queen Kapiolani rapidly faded away. She may not be the prettiest or most glamorous hotel to stay at in Waikiki, but whatever she lacked she gained in the views and the very comfortable feel she afforded us. The hotel's restaurant on the third floo is a little gem as well. Again there is nothing fancy about it. But, the food, especially breakfast is, cheap, good, and large portions. The restaurant staff are also very pleasant and efficient and always have a smile. Even on the morning of the earthquake they managed to serve a limited but sufficient menu of breakfast items, and with a smile! They told us they use gas for some of their cooking so therefor they were able to still cook some items. This was the best little secret in the area at that time, seeing as how there were lines wrapping around the street corners to get a sandwich at the many ABC stores around that particular area.  So, in conclusion, if you are looking for luxury and expensive and glamorous surroundings, the Queen Kapiolani will not be for you, but, if you are looking for a clean, comfortable and very affordable place to stay while in Oahu that offer top notch views of both Diamond Head and the Ocean, and you are not too fussy about the finer things in life, you should be very happy at the Queen Kapiolani. We travel often and have stayed at every class of accomodation at some point or another. Our stay at the Queen Kapiolani has further convinced me, that you don't need to stay at the best hotels to have the best vacation experience. Personally I don't really give a toss about expensive hotels anymorel. I would rather spend the saved cash on other things. So in a nutshell! what is the Queen Kapiolani? It's cheap, it's clean, the staff are really down to earth and friendly and you would be hard pressed to find better views of the ocean and Diamond Head anywhere else in Oahu. All in all it was a really fun and pleasant vacation. Would we do it again? You bet your life we would! Oh! one last thing, the beds are really comfy!

<Content>Good for Waikiki on a budget We stayed at the Queen Kapiolani for three nights in the middle of June. We were going to be arriving 3 days ahead of schedule, so we decided to take the cheapest hotel we could find and bear with it until our other accomodation was ready. Please note, one of the online booking sites insists this hotel has an indoor pool. (It does not.)We arrived 2 1/2 hours before check-in. The hotel gladly held our bags while we went for lunch. Our room was ready a bit early, and check in was a breeze.Our room was on the 17th floor and was an ample size. We had a balcony, the TV worked well, there was a mini fridge and the beds were extremely comfortable.The pool was fine, just watch the tiles. They are extremely slippery and some are loose. We never ate at the restaurant. The internet site said there was a breakfast buffet, but that had stopped some time ago.There is a small sundry store in the lobby, the older woman working there is wonderful!The staff were all very friendly.The hotel is old and dated, but I found it to be as clean as it could be.The hotel is located at the quiet older end of Waikiki. One block from the beach and the zoo. A couple of times we were awoken by animals from the zoo in the middle of the night. (I think it was the hyenas.)The elevators were a bit slow and a bit scary. Half the time they would open before reaching the floor.For the price, this hotel is definately worth it.

<Content>Great location and fantastic value! I would highly recommend the Queen Kapiolani, the room rates were extremely reasonable and the location is excellent - very close to the quieter part of Waikiki Beach, round the corner from shops and restaurants and opposite the zoo and park. Our room was on the 17th floor with fabulous views of the city (and ocean) and we enjoyed it so much we returned there later in our trip, to our delight we were upgraded to a bigger room.It was clean and quiet and exactly what we were looking for - ideal if you're planning to spend your time out and about exploring.

<Content>Great price  Stayed here during the first week of September for 3 nights. The hotel staff was very friendly and the location of the hotel was great (only 2 blocks away from Waikiki beach). We paid for parking ($8/day); although you could probably find street parking. Our hotel room was clean and also had a great view. If you're looking for an affordable hotel that is clean with a friendly staff, I recommend the Queen Kapiolani hotel.

<Content>Great View This hotel is located on one end of Waikiki Beach, If you are looking for a cheap, and comfortable hotel to stay in, this would be it.The one mistake i made was not requesting that i would like a double bed, so they gave us two single beds.The staff at the hotel are fantastic, especially the bartender in the pool bar. There are plently of places to eat around the area and a few different bars... where we spent most of our evenings. We made quite a few friends in these places and would visit them again. If you want to go to the Airport or Pearl Harbour (USS Arizona Memorial), take a shuttle bus. It is alot quicker and worth the $5.00 per person. If you like to shop, then jump on a trolley (available from the Resort Quest around the corner) down to the Ala Moana center, it may take a little longer, but its free.The view from our room was great and from the pool deck you can see the Ocean and Diamond Head in one. The hotel is about a 10-15 min walk to the International Marketplace but walk along the road with the beach on it, it seems safer and you see alot more interesting things.Besides the bath tub being a bit small and the shower head a bit low, the rest of our stay was fantastic.

<Content>Great place to stay! Good value. We are so glad we chose this location on the edge of Waikiki. We requested a higher floor with an ocean view and this is a MUST if you want to enjoy your stay. We were on the top floor with lanais on two sides...one looking at the city view high rises around us and the other with the unobstructed view of the beach a few blocks away and the greenery of the zoo and foliage and ocean towards Diamondhead. So many of the less expensive hotels in Waikiki are surrounded by highrises with no view and noisy streets. We slept with the windows open and enjoyed the sound of the surf and walked a few short blocks to the great beach and the shopping and restaurants. Parking was convenient and cheap for the area, staff was helpful and friendly and we were not charged for every service (eg phone calls, faxes) like we were at a recent Hyatt stay. The hotel is old and a little shabby especially in the areas of the restaurant and pool ,and not on the beach so if you want a newer, cleaner, modern building you will be disappointed. But the room was clean, large and the bed was comfy and the price was right.

<Content>Great Value for the Dollars Spent We just flew home tonight after four nights at the Queen Kapiolani. For the money we spent per night ($120) the views that we got could not be any better. Sure, it's an older hotel, and yes, it needs to be updated ( and looks like it hasn't been updated since it was built), but we had room 1118 and the views were WONDERFUL from all the windows and our OUTDOOR DECK. We had dinner out on the deck one evening to watch the sunset and it could easily sit four adults. Full Diamond Head views, Full Waikiki Beach views, Sunrise and Sunset. At another hotel along the strip, or any place else in Hawaii - you'd spend at least five times that much. The room had a kitchen-ette, and we used it. We were lucky with parking, always got a space (although if you rent a big car, the you'd have to be pretty good at navigating around cement columns!. The staff was friendly and the elevators were fine. The bottom line is - if you're looking for a safe, clean and inexpensive hotel just a block (or less) away from Waikiki beach - overlooking Diamond Head, the Zoo, Queen Kapiolani Park, and Waikiki beach - THIS IS IT.

<Content>Big disappointment but a lot like the rest of Waikiki hotels Front desk personnel and the concierge were not friendly or helpful. The room itself is tolerable. You are always told to not touch the bed spread at a hotel鈥ell don't touch the blanket beneath that either. Our toilet ran and our tub did not drain. ! We did call about the toilet and they came up to fix it within minutes, so apparently maintenance is okay. Coffee in the room cost about a buck and half per pouchThere are 130-150 rooms but less than 50 actual parking spots in the garage below the hotel (if you come in late you hand your keys over to overworked attendants that move your car around the garage all night and morning to get other cars in and out! ) Speaking of the garage, you pick up your pool towel down there even though the pool is on the thrid floor of the hotel, this coupled with the fact that the elevator does not go to the garage is just weird. You get to do your laundry in the garage too and it looks as if the staff take their breaks in the garage! There's nasty old lawn chairs and maybe a couch or two arranged in a corner of the garage. I think that was for the lucky staff.The pool is on the third floor. It probably can hold 30 people absolute max. Its pretty deep if you have kids. Most shocking of all is that the pool closes at 6PM!!!!Again, the pool closes at 6 pm.!!!I'm sure the hotel has reasons for this b/c the open air dining room, which is fairly good and very very friendly, is adjacent to the pool. But I'm not certain why the hotel cannot reopen the pool after dinner or why they can't just build a noise barrier. Many people enjoy some non-salty water swim when on vacation! The hotel apparently does not care what you wanted on your vacation in this regard.Will all this said, it looks like many other Waikiki hotels are like this one, even the more $$$ ones. I hope if you travel to Oahu you will realize that the Waikiki beach is not a great beach...its not really even a good beach. Its too crowded, it has very little to look at while you snorkel and at least in the summer is really only good for beginner surfers.We went in August and the North beach was great, I believe in the winter this changes so check with a snorkel shop before you go. Do NOT rent snokel gear at the Queens shop! You can do a lot better at an independent shop, with many mask sizes and types.

<Content>A place too sleep...... We stayed at the Queen for 4 nights . Had a few good laughs such as the shower head so low it was a little higher than chest level and the in room coffee costs $1.30 if you use it. The best thing about this hotel is that it is not one that you want too sit around and relax in . It makes you want to get out of there thus keeping you out and about doing the things that you visit hawaii for !!!!!!!!!!! We paid $80.00 per night !!! I guess I cant complain too much. 2 minute walk too the beach that was great. Its a place too sleep and thats about it....

<Content>budget hotel A few years ago my husband and I went to Waikiki to celebrate our anniversary and decided that we would one day bring our boys back to experiance Hawaii as well. That one day came and were all very excited to enjoy our vacation. We arrived at the Queen Kapiolani 10:30pm Hawaii time (1:30am our time) upon checking in to the hotel the desk clerk asked me for a cc for incidentals, she became aggitated with me when I responded that the room was pre-paid and we didnt need to have any incidentals. She then responded very rudly that shed just turn everything off, gave me my room key and tried to send me on my way. she told me nothing of the hotel. When we reached our room we found it very small with only 2 double beds, the one thing we did like was the balcony. later my husband attempted to call for pizza to find the phone was off, ok, so he called the front desk for assistance only to hear the front desk clerk that checked us in yelling in the back ground that our cc was maxed out!! the gentleman helping my husband said we needed a cc or $100.00 deposit refundable at c/o, why didnt the young lady that checked us in explain that? we didnt know local calls were .75 cents each and that the packets of coffee in the room were $1.30 each. this was turning into a pain in the butt. this is no way to treat guests that come to visit your hotel! I spoke to the manager Monday morning--he seemed nice enough to listen to my complaints but did nothing about them and gave a non shalont apology at the end of our conversation... never again will we stay there or recomend it to anyone.... i will however recommend that if you do stay there and want to do any activities to speak to the travel desk there, they are wonderful people and make you feel very welcome.

<Content>Getting Pretty Bad Liike every one has said , the location  view are wonderful , but then there's your room and the slow elevators. The rooms need a new face lift bad and the bathrooms are getting gross, I went to have breakfast with my family, and after waiting over 20 minutes for a elevator they where leaving the restraunt by the time I got there. And the tile around the pool is VERY SLIPPERY, my grandchildren fell many times. I would recommend this hotel only if it's all you can afford and you want to be close to the beach.

<Content>good for the price We stayed in the Queen Kapiolani 6 nights ,and than anoither 4 nights after a trip to Kona.We think the Hotel is Ok for the price, Very close to the beach and park.The fisrt time we stayed in room 115 , this was a very small room with just 1 bed, nobalcony but with a seaview. To small for 2 people , hardly room to put you laguage inThe second time we had another room on the 11 floor , much bigger and again a niceview, No balcony. Because we had a late flights home , we tried to rent a extra day butwe were shocked by the high price ( 140 $ for 1 night) , standard room , we only paidabout $ 90 to our travel agency.If you simply want a clean room , close to the beach , and do not want to pay a lotthe Queen kapiolani can be a good choose.Not a lot of chairs at the pool !! and they close at 18.00 why ??? We were sent awaysitting there after 18.00 ???

<Content>Great location close to the Waikiki Shell We have stayed here twice in the past 2 years-the first time for 2 nights and the second for just 1 night. Both times we were in town to catch the Kokua festival at the Waikiki Shell. This hotel is located across the street from Kapiolani Park where you'll find the Honolulu Zoo and Waikiki Shell. The walk to the concert venue is about 5 minutes tops. It is on the very eastern edge of Waikiki, about 3 blocks up from the beach. There's plenty of dining options close by. We didn't try the hotel's restaurant as it didn't seem too appealing to us 30 year old's, maybe it would be good for breakfast...Both times we were upgraded from their cheapest room to a room with a window facing Diamond Head and partial view of the water- no balcony, though. We were just happy to get the upgrade at no charge. Never have seen the standard room yet. The rooms were acceptably clean, however, the carpets throughout the hotel looked like the could use a good cleaning. The decor is kind of dated but the room size was large (compared to another hotel in Waikiki that we stayed at for the same price). We didn't have any issues with the staff, check in was very quick and easy. There's a pool with a nice unobstructed view of Diamond Head. We used the airport shuttle the first trip and found that we were just about the last stop on the route. The second trip we used the parkade for the rental car. We arrived early so we found a spot no problem. Relatively tight spaces, though, we had to be marshaled out in the morning. Overall, we found this hotel to be a great $$$ value, close to our desired attraction. It's probably not the nicest hotel you'll ever stay in but if you're like us and don't spend a lot of time in your room because you're too busy exploring, you'll find this to be an ideal hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed from April 9th thru the 16. Very clean and enjoyable hotel. We were on the 8th floor and had a great view of Diamond Head and the ocean. The hotel is old and is in need of some work but I would stay at this hotel again when I come back to Oahu!!

<Content>Bargain and convenient location For years, I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and never really enjoyed Waikiki much as I stayed on the hotel grounds only. The Queen Kapiolani is tired and could use a major update but the location is fabulous and a few dollars more guarantees you an ocean view room. The hotel is convenient to everything and has bus stops right in front. if, like me, you juts need a place to sleep and shower, the beds could be better but the water has always been hot, and it is a bargain! I was skeptical the first time I stayed here, but I am barely in the room, so why pay more? I will be spending my 3rd vacation there in 2 weeks.

<Content>Can't Recomment This hotel is in need of a big makeover, standard rooms are really small, seems some motels have better rooms than their standard rooms. Service was good, but thats about it for this hotel.

<Content>I can't recommend staying here This is an older hotel in need of a make-over, this should start with a carpet good cleaning.After a day on the beach we returned to our room to find that my wifes wedding ring was missing. Manager (Brian) did help us look and even had a maintenance man come move furniture and inspect the pipe under the sink. But, the ring was left on a desk and had DISAPPEARED. When I return to Oahu I will not be staying at the Kapiolani. You have been warned. Aloha!

<Content>Ocean view to Die For My husband  I took our 2 teenagers (17  18) on their first Hawaii trip! We had a wonderful time and the kids want to go back.The best thing about the Queen is the LOCATION. We paid $120 for an ocean view (worth the extra). We were on the fourteeth floor (1412). Staff was pleasant  helpful, we felt safe and never had a noise problem in the 10 days. We got extra towels everyday and they were nice ones. The double bed was comfortable but I would of preferred a queen. Pillows were okay. Never saw any creepy crawly's.Negatives. Yes, the hotel needs a major upgrade, carpet was stained as well as the tub. Walls had marks on them. It took 10 - 15 minutes for the water to drain from the tub. Housekeeping was daily but usually didn't make it into the room until the afternoon (and I did leave a tip).Would we go back, YES. If you are not fussy and do not mind a budget hotel that is clean but very dated this place is for you. We left with smiles on our faces and isn't that what a holiday is about!

<Content>Fabulous Value  We stayed Feb 2, 3, and 4, 2006 in Room 1114. This hotel is less expensive than most in the area, basically because it is an older property and not as fancy (costly) as the newer, shinier places. It's not glitz and polish that gets to my heart, though. It's substance, and this old hotel has got it in spades. She is in an absolutely fabulous location, truly only a few paces from Waikiki Beach (you won't feel foolish stepping out of the hotel in your bathing suit), all the shops, etc, and right across the street from the Honolulu Zoo and a large public park. We checked in late at night, and were awakened by the fabulous sounds of exotic birds at the zoo and in the park. We opened our drapes and were taken aback by the gorgeous vista of Diamondhead directly ahead, and Waikiki Beach just to the right. It was absolutely breathtaking and we did not expect to have such a gorgeous view. You won't find a better view from any hotel in Honolulu, and that's the truth. Our lanai was a great size, with a couple of chairs and a small table, and a nice metal railing. There was also a sink out on the lanai, with a cabinet beneath it. Our bathroom had a great showerhead in the tub, plenty of hot water, and it was squeaky clean - the only problem was that the drain was a little slow. The towels were thick and thirsty, and there were plenty of them. There were two double beds in our room, a mini-refrigerator, television, large dresser, a table with two caned chairs, some basic tropical artwork, a large mirror, and a huge mirror-door closet. Our room was right behind the bank of elevators, and although we expected to have some noise problems, we never noticed it. The hotel restaurant has some funny hours for lunch and dinner, but it is immaculate and they serve great food. There appeared to be a lot of locals at the bar in the evenings and at the breakfast buffet ($7.50) which was constantly being re-stocked, and hot-hot-hot food, eggs, french toast or pancakes, fried rice, oatmeal, salad fixings, bacon, fresh fruits, potatoes, toast, etc, all you could want - and the cold food was iced and the hot food was kept HOT. There are waitresses running around making sure everyone has what they need, and they are obsessively filling the patrons' coffee cups, cleaning off used plates, and readying tables for the next patron. Try the pass-o-guava juice - it is delicious. We ate breakfast here each day; it was so good, we didn't want to even try another place. The drinks we had in the evening at the quiet little bar were reasonably priced and delicious.The restaurant is right beside the third floor outdoor pool, which I suppose could be a problem for some people, but the hours of the pool are limited. The pool and deck was clean and tidy, and our room overlooked it, and we saw men our there cleaning several times during our stay. There is a terrific gift shop in the hotel on the ground level, with very competitive prices and sometimes better prices than the nearby ABC Stores. There is also a beach shop with surfboards, etc., with competitive prices. This lobby is wide open and gorgeous. There are gigantic marble pillars and crystal chandeliers all over the place. The huge chandeliers are tethered with steel cables to keep them from blowing in the breezes that must sweep through the lobby from time to time. There are interesting huge old oil portraits of various members of Hawaiian royalty throughout the lower levels of the hotel. The second floor of the hotel is apparently office space and meeting rooms, but it is gorgeous. The elevators are a bit slow, probably because they are so old, but they do the job. The hotel staff is professional, well-trained, competent and fabulous. They are friendly, helpful, and they obviously enjoy working at this property. Every time we had a question, they had the answers and suggestions. We had great service in our room, and all of the housekeeping staff we ran into were happy and friendly as well. We were asked repeatedly if everything was okay.If you are looking for shiny new things in your hotel lobby and your room, this is not the place. The furnishings are older, but solid and comfortable - dare I say retro. There were a few noticeable problems, such as a ripped hall carpet and a chip in the wall, but you could tell that every imperfection had been attended to, even if not expertly repaired. There is a bus stop and taxi stand almost directly in front of the hotel, which is convenient if you want to go to Pearl Harbor or Diamondhead. (I'd recommend a taxi to Diamondhead's ticket office ($10), however.) There are several restaurants around the corner, fronting Waikiki Beach, and shops galore. This hotel is in a very convenient location, and although I have read reviews about noise being a problem here, we stayed on two weekend nights and had no major problem with it - Saturday morning around 4 a.m. we were awakened by a car alarm from the parking lot across the street at the park - but that's life. We were a little wary of this hotel due to the price, but this should not be of concern to anyone. From experience, we know you can pay more, but the value and location and service is not to be surpassed. We paid $104 per night plus taxes for our room at the Queen Kap and we absolutely loved every second of our stay. She is truly a Grand Dame of the ages. When we return to Hawaii, we hope we will be able to visit her again.

<Content>Only if you don't want to spend more I paid $85 per night for an ocean view. The room was mediocre, with a tear in the carpet by the door that we tripped on a few times. The room looked old, but the bed was comfortable and the overall cleanliness of the room was acceptable. The location of the room left more to be desired than the appearance. The room was located in the corner where two wings of the hotel came together to form an L. Our view was compromised by the fact that if we left our curtains open, our neighbors could see directly into our room from their balcony, where they spent much time. We could clearly hear any conversations these neighbors were having, and could hear our 2nd set of neighbors through the poorly insulated walls. The room was also near the elevators and a particular elevator would make a loud and long buzzing sound when it arrived on any floor. This woke us up several times during the nights. The sacrifices in comfort were not worth the low price.

<Content>It's Hawaii I've stayed at other hotels in Waikiki but the Queen Kapiolani is my favorite for many reasons. I used to live in Hawaii and feel right at home there. So yes the rooms are not luxurious but the beds are very comfortable. The Bathroom was clean and it had everything I needed. Great view, great location -- I walk everywhere -- it's so close to Starbucks, ABC stores, Beach. I go there to relax and won't spent all my time in the room but spent it with my friends, so you just can't beat the price of a room. Everyone is friendly, very accommodating, that's all I want. I'll be visiting again soon and will stay there again.

<Content>A Great Spot We stayed ten days at this hotel and had no complaints. The service was good and the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was relatively quiet and we enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and serviced on a daily basis, had an ocean view and the bed was comfortable. The cost was reasonable and fit well into our budget. The location was great, within a block of the beach and giving easy access to attractions such as International Marketplace, the Zoo and Kapiolani Park. The Bus stopped in front of the hotel and was easy to use. We would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it to others.

<Content>Decent, but... We stayed in Studio Mountain view room with a Kitchenette and had both +ve and -ve experiences. +ve:We were on the 12th floor and had an excellent view of the diamond head crater and a partial, but a beautiful view of the ocean.Nice breeze at this height. No need of an AC.A couple of minutes walk to Waikiki beach.Right across the Honolulu Zoo.Bus stop right in front of the hotel.-ve:Came across three cockroaches going around the room. Disgusting expecially when we have a 17 month old toddler exploring all the nooks and corners.Very basic kitchenette. OK, but could have been better.Laundry room is in the basement and looks very tacky.Coffee maker is provided in the room, but they charge US $1.50 per packet of Kona coffee!!Neutral points:Old decor and needs some painting, but maintained cleanly, except for the cockroaches mentioned above.Courteous staff. No complaints there.Summary:An OK room and hotel. But as you will be spending quite a bit for a trip to Hawaii, you may as well spend an additional $50 to $60 per night and get a better room.

<Content>great deal My husband and I stayed at this hotel Jan. 18-25 2006We could not have been more pleased with the location!! We have been to Hawaii 4 times, and chose this hotel for the location. We were pleased with the view from the room, and the maids cleaned quite well every day. Our bathtub drain was clogged our first day,but the hotel staff was super polite and quick about fixing it! The rooms were small, the beds uncomfortable, but who cares!! You're in Hawaii!! The zoo and park were right across the street, and the beach is just a short block away. Starbucks is a block away too(a neccesity for any vacation)! Our goal for this vacation was to be as lazy as humanly possible, and this hotel was perfect. We hope to stay here again next year, if that tells you anything.

<Content>If you like slummin' it..... Then this is the place for you. This hotel is run by a Japanese investment group that has no plans of putting money into it. The elevator breaks down 3-4 times a day, and the front desk staff is rude. If you want to feel like a slum lord, then this place is for you.One ice machine in the lobby and broken elevators mean that you won't have a cold drink. It will also mean that you will either be spending the day in your room, or not getting back to your room. There was also one instance of the elevator dropping too fast and people were hurt. Ouch, I guess they won't put money into the elevator until someone is killed.

<Content>Basic but cheap This is a very basic hotel that has a great location. It's literally only a block from Waikiki beach and the rooms have a really great view of either the ocean or diamond head mountain. If you're looking for a place to stay without dropping a ton of money, this could be a great place for you. However, it desperately needs a renovation (my husband wasn't the biggest fan of the place). Pros: Great location, great views, cheap price (lets you spend you money on other things). Our room had a bar fridge and a lanai which we used a ton.Cons: Needs a reno! The can't guarantee a king size bed with some rooms so my husband and I had to push our two single beds together at night. I don't think anyone really uses the resturant but there are tons of great places on the main strip.

<Content>Very Bad Hotel This is the second worst hotel that I have ever stayed in. I stayed in room 516. This hotel was nice in the lobby so I was excited to see what my room was like. It was tiny, the carpet was dirty and the walls needed to be painted. The matress on the bed was as stiff as a board, and about 20 years old. I think that if you want a better hotel, there are many that are better priced than this one. The only good thing that it has going for it.... it's a half a block from the beach.

<Content>No Aloha, No View, No Remorse... The only true ocean view is floor 12 or above. The picture on their web site is of a corner unit only; neither will they guarantee. The Bellman and front desk clerks are rude, have one face for Kama'ainas, one other for Malahini's; not the Aloha our mainland friends expect, or deserve as guests in the Islands.The hotel is full is an excuse I have often gotten at this hotel when requesting a different room. Worn carpet, moldy bathrooms, miserable beds/mattress you will find here. Don't ask for a studio with kitchenette; it is a connecting room, and the adjoining room has no noise proofing, full 1 inch gap under the connecting door so you can hear everyting as if sharing the room.

<Content>A good deal for the money. I stayed here for a weekend in June. I had stayed nearby a couple of years earlier and, since I only had a couple of days, I wanted to stay in an area I was familiar with. The Queen K. fit the bill nicely, especially since I was able to get a good internet deal somewhere around 89/night for a corner room with a view of Diamondhead, the ocean, and the park/zoo. And the room was larger than some of the rooms that the newer chains are able to market as suites because they put in a microwave and cram in a cheap, cheap sofa. In fact there was enough room for one of those. But there was just a table and chairs and room to move around. The room was old, somewhat worn around the edges, and very clean. You could tell it had been quite a grand place once. There was a little refrigerator and a balcony with a little outdoor ( and outdated ) sink/bar. Nice for sitting outside without having to go down 12 floors but not large enough for more than two or three people. The room was very airy and light having large windows across two walls. I could hear the animals in the morning and, unlike one of the earlier posters, I liked waking up to the monkey chatter from the zoo.In my opinion the location is on the perfect end of waikiki. It is within walking distance of the aquarium, some fairly good restaurants, and some nice shopping a few blocks to the west. Driving in and out of this area is fairly easy also once you have done it a couple of times. I think its a good hotel for people who want a lower priced place to sleep and use as a hub. If you want your hotel to be a resort and to be a major part of your 'vacation experience' then you could do better - but at a higher price.The breakfast buffet is like the room, decent for the price. I ate there and definitely did not feel cheated. There are some better alternatives a short walk away though, including the Marriot ( about twice the price but worth it).If you have rented a car try to make arrangements for a parking space before you get there. Either call or email. They do not have enough parking to accomodate all the customers. If all spaces in their garage are assigned before you check in you may have a hard time finding anything. I was lucky but some of the patrons I talked to had been told to park in the zoo parking lot across the street. The problem is that the parking there is metered and they had to get up in the middle of the night and feed the meter before it ran out. They may be offering a better solution now since this was 6 months ago and they were certainly hearing some negative feedback from the folks who were unlucky. It would be a good idea to check before arriving though.The staff were ok. I didn't have any particularly special experience with them but have nothing negative to report. I did notice that they were making an effort trying to cram cars into whatever open space was available in order the satisfy the parking issues. So I would rate them as helpful. One of the previous posters noted that is was on the 'gay' end of waikiki. I have been on this end a couple of times now and I don't think you should worry about it. There are lots of families walking around in this area. Really. Don't let yourself be spooked by this sort of talk.I hope they do not do a major renovation. I expect be coming here for one or two short trips a year for a while and like the idea of having a budget place to stay in this convenient location. With a renovation it would probably go for over $200.Conclusion:If you can get one of the corner rooms with a view for under $100 I think you are getting a deal.

<Content>a long travel for nothing having toured the west coast of the usa and had a very interesting enjoyable if tiring time we flew to hawaii for a relaxing week in paradise. or so we all thought.after our arrival we found our beautiful view was that of a high rise concrete jungle. our room was a mess. brown tape held the carpet down, bathroom fittings were loose and the bath was chipped.the dressing table and the fridge were in a disgusting unrepairable state. the decor was well overdue a revamp. in all a real mess.when i complained i was told that the hotel was full and nothing could be done.we did not use the resterant but others in our party did. ( ONCE ) and they did not return. enough said.the hotel is in a great location and that is all i can say on the plus side.before i went on this holiday i read reports about this hotel and i thought well it cant be that bad.do not make my mistake it is.spend that little more it will be worth it.

<Content>We loved it, but some people won't Let me begin by telling you all of the things we loved about the Queen Kap: our room was spotlessly clean every day; our room was open and airy; we had gorgeous views (one wall was all windows facing the ocean, and the other wall was all windows facing Waikiki); we even had a high window in our bathroom; we never had to wait more than a minute for an elevator; the pool area and lobby were both open and spacious; we had a sink on our lanai (great for washing out swimsuits); we had plenty of room to spread out for the two of us; we were right on the bus line; it was much quieter on this end of Waikiki than some other places I'd stayed; and best of all, the staff was TERRIFIC! Each person we encountered was very friendly and professional, from the desk clerks who checked us in and gave us a new room key when we lost ours in the ocean, to the security guys joking with us in the lobby, from the bellman who voluntarily fixed us up with a cab when we missed the bus, to the housekeeper who promptly fixed the lamp in our room when we left her a note about it. Now, to really get down to business and discuss the negatives about this property... remember, folks, this is a 2-star hotel for a reason!! Yes, the furnishings are very dated, but they were clean. Some of the glaze was peeling off the bathtub, and the sink was stained, but again, they were clean. The hallways were dark, but they smelled fine to us, and they were clean. Sense a theme here? The ice machine was in the lobby, which meant we had to schlep our ice bucket 12 floors down. However, when you stay at a 2-star, you must be prepared to make sacrifices because you DO get what you pay for! This is why the prices are so low... if the hotel ever does a complete renovation, they'll start charging $200/night like everyone else!Noticed that some posters had referred to the Queen not being very family-friendly because it was in the gay section of town. All I actually saw when I was there (in reference to that area catering to GLBT customers) was a rainbow flag at the bar of the hotel next door, and a higher-than-average number of good-looking men in capri pants. That was it! People were VERY respectful of each other, and I never saw anything that I would've needed to shield from a child (coming from a very conservative writer here!). You would probably find much more of that in other areas of Waikiki... prostitutes, anyone?I honestly believe that many of the negative reviews posted here are a reflection of travelers either being upset because they really didn't do their homework about what kind of hotel they were getting, or they expected the Outrigger but weren't willing to pay for it. If you look at the reviews, you'll find that most people either loved or or detested the place. If all you truly want is a clean room near the beach with beautiful views of the ocean or Diamond Head, then you will probably be very happy at the Queen Kapiolani. HOWEVER, if you go on vacations expecting to live in luxury, if you have ever been accused of being high-maintenance, or if staying in an EconoLodge-type room is not acceptable for you, then you will probably want to stay elsewhere. As for me... I'll keep on loving those low prices and outdated furnishings... I spent all of my time in the room looking out at the beautiful views, anyway!

<Content>Don't do it!!  This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in my life. My husband is a general manager for a major hotel chain(unfortunatly none in Hawaii) so we tend to be more forgiving than most knowing the difficulties in running a hotel, however this hotel was just terrible. MOLD MOLD MOLD!!!!! Very dated horrible parking rude front desk just terrible. We stayed one night and left.Last year we stayed at the park shores and it was very nice. about the same price range, right next door and a much better experience.

<Content>dated and in need of a full overhaul. rooms shabby and poor service. Stayed there 23rd August 2005. One night was enough. This hotel would have been a stunner in its day... 30 or so years ago. Very dated and maintenance has not been keep up. Better places to stay.Trevor  Liz Gold Coast Australia

<Content>STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!! Last year I went to Hawaii and booked 2 rooms at the Queen Kapiolani. The carpets stunk of bad foot odour, the washroom was stained all over, the bed was lumpy. One night the power went off and when it came back on the fire alarm rang. It was 4AM and it rang for over 30 minutes. The hotel staff couldn't care less. Early in the morning you could hear the garbage trucks picking up the garbage. Our room had a view of the alley where the dumpsters were and you could smell the garbage from our room. I would never stay there again. The room was so bad, the worst I have ever been in. I had no choice because I prepaid for this dump. I have no idea how any one could like this dump. The buffet area was gross, you could see flies all around the food. The elevators kept stalling. The best part of this hotel was leaving it and never having to go back to this dump again.

<Content>Great for the price My husband and I stayed at the hotel in May of 2005. We thought it was a great location. Very close to the beach, zoo, etc. The parking attendants were very nice and had a difficult job because there is very little parking. They would have to double park the cars and move them when you came to get your car. Yes, you have to pay for parking but I haven't stayed at a hotel where you haven't had to pay for parking in Waikiki. My husband and I like to spend money on activities and other things and not the room. We don't plan to spend a lot of time in the room. If you are looking for a top notch hotel don't stay there but if you want a clean place to stay it's great. We had a delux room that had a bed and then a small couch that would also make into a bed. The room was very big and we had room to store our bikes in the room. We would stay at the hotel again.

<Content>Great stay My wife and I stayed at the Queen Kapiolani from August 8th through 16th, in a corner room on the 11th floor. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfortable and large, the vista extended from Wakiki Beach on the right through Diamond Head to the left, and the cross-breezes from the lanai through the windows were so lovely that we never even bothered to turn on the air conditioning. The staff were professional, helpful and courteous; the other guests caused no undue ruckus; the street noise was more than tolerable (except perhaps on Friday night, when the locals got a bit frisky). Then again, we're from New York City, so anything is likely to seem sedate by comparison.I cannot understand the fault-finding of some others in this forum, who complain of faded carpets in the halls and lobby (which, as is common in Hawaii, has been left open to the elements, as it should be). If you're looking for a backdrop for your wedding photographs, go borrow the lobby of a five-star hotel. It was an excellent deal for the money, just excellent. We'd recommend it to anyone.

<Content>ROOM REVIEW my children and I stayed at the hotel July 11-18, 2005. We had a deluxe room city view and my mom stayed in the standard room. What a difference!!! I loveD our deluxe room. Very roomie! for 3 epople and we had are own lanai!! (BALCONY) we had a side ocean view too. The housekeeping was very good. Everyone employee we ran into was helpful and friendly. Even the pool security guard.I would definetely stay here again. The store in the lobby gave a refreshing break from the hight cost of ABCS stores. and it was 1/2 a block to the beach, zoo and aquarium.My moms standard room was very small, but clean and she had a pretty view of Diamond Head and the ocean, She loved it too. I would however reccommend the deluxe room. I couldnt get over how big the room was!The kids loved the pool too. so what if the elevators where a tad old, they still worked!

<Content>No Parking with the Queen If you are using a rental car to enjoy sites of the island, do not stay here. Please be advised that there is NO parking. You will not find a parking space and will have to park illegally in the street or 5 to 6 blocks away. No blow dryer, no iron or ironing board. Upon arrival, the clerk advised that we would have to purchase an additional room for our 3rd child although our reservations stipulated one room with 2 doubles and a roll-away. Fortunately, a printed confirmation convinced them to honor our reservation. This is not a hotel for those traveling with a family.

<Content>Had an awful experience Upon arrival of the hotel we found that there were NO PARKING for hotel guests, we had to literally park about a mile away and walk to the hotel.They concession out the parking and the concessionaire overbooked the spaces, so that left the PAYING GUESTS out looking for parking. The parking attendant sent us out to other hotels to look for parking and they said that it was about 3 blocks away, yeah right. The attendant also said that the hotel would reimburse us for the parking, found out that was not true (be prepared to pay $8.00 PER NIGHT for parking at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel). After all of this fiasco, we go out for the day to return to a room that looked like they only fix the beds, there were no clean towels to replace the ones that were used. I had to call housekeeping for clean towels and food containers that were for disposal were left on the dresser, this was all on day 2. Day 3 was better for parking because they decided to double park all the cars and we were lucky enough to get a parking sticker. However, upon returning to the room, the towel situation was the same. All in all I will not stay at the the Queen Kapiolani Hotel again.

<Content>Okay stay.. We stayed here in June 2005. The hotel was old, rooms were even older! It was a very ECONOMICAL stay and that it was! It is close to the beach and you have some great views from the pool...but the place is one step above being a dump! If you want a stay in Waikiki at a cheap price and dont want to stay long..here is your hotel.

<Content>Liked the queen kapiolani hotel, but.... We stayed at the hotel for 4 days and since it loocked nice tome from the outside, i booked a room.I agree, the location, the zoo across the street, the Diamond Headclose by and a little view over to the beach, was very pleasant.The hallwayscarpets loocked very bad and the breakfastbuffett was quieta letdown.Wished, management would invest a little money on the carpets andthe lobby too.But we still liked our stay.

<Content>A Good Deal Stayed for 4 nights and had a really good stay. Friendly, helpful staff. Tour/Activities staff in lobby very knowledgeable. Poor points are very limited parking and having to go to basement to get a pool towel from Housekeeping versus poolside on 3rd floor. The AC units chill your room quickly. Breakfast buffet good deal for the money and their dinners are just as good as any other restaurant. Excellent location (beach, zoo, aquarium, shopping, etc) and easy to find. Rooms are dated but clean and larger than you'd expect for the price. I would definitely stay there again and plan to do so!

<Content>Worth The money I'll be honest and say this is a difficult property to review. There are positives and negatives, so I'll be as accurate as possible.Hawaii is expensive...we all know that. We found Honolulu quite expensive for what is offered. The Queen Kap was a compromise, and not that big of a deal to do so.The hotel has a great location, about a small block up from the beach-no big deal. Yes it's across from the zoo, but for me it was amazing hearing a Gibbon hoot in the morning. I miss the little guy!! And by the way, the zoo was great, especially for $6...I couldn't believe the low fee.The room was sorta small, but as we later found out at another disaster in Honolulu I won't go into, there are rooms a lot smaller. It was not too small to live in though, not like we were bumping into each other. And believe me, there are rooms in Honolulu like that! So not a suite in Vegas size, but it's not the mainland so we'll leave it at that.The decor in our room was old and tired. Certainly not a feast for the eyes; this older hotel put their money into the lobby. Again, we dealt. The bathroom was adequate and clean, no prob.'s. The air conditioner could freeze you solid if necessary, and I'm a cool-air-loving, wife yelling at me because I froze her to death last night kind of guy. So no worries there!The staff were friendly and helpful. Believe me, if you have problems at a hotel, this is invaluable. And the guy at the snorkel/beach shop in the lobby knows his stuff and has tons of good advice on everything and cheap rentals.The breakfast buffet was a good deal and tasty too. I believe it is a local favourite, so that's a good sign. It wasn't fancy, but it was always a relaxing way to start our day. And the ladies coming around serving tea and coffee were like older mother's, very sweet.The pool is smallish, but not heavily populated. There are bigger pools in the city, but it's combat to get a chair by the water and crowded with tons of people and kids and you have a crappy time. This pool is not like that at all. My wife is a pool/tan professional! and she had the pool to herself at times. The guests were all very respectful re: noise. VERY relaxing. And I swear the sun is on you for the entire day, I don't know how but ladies...bring your sun block, you're gonna need it!!I did not hear much street noise on the 12th floor, looking at Diamondhead. But, I can see how that could happen. Request a high room. If this is your only stop in Hawaii, you might think about upgrading your accommodations. But if you don't mind outdated decor, no prob. You get a decent place to stay for the money. That's an honest judgement, I think. Remember your parents' advice: you get what you pay for! Honestly, even if you stayed and were a bit disappointed with the room, you won't be badly burned or anything. And remember, the pretty pictures of rooms on the internet for hotels aren't always representative of what you get.DO NOT stay at a $69 special and think you got the deal of the century. You might end up in a 10 x 10 ft piece of crap. You could do a lot worse than the Queen in Honolulu. If you want to avoid any problems then pay $300/night for one of the pretty resorts in East Waiki. Ya, we would have loved that, except for the bill part. I think the safe money would be on the Queen Kap. And say hi to that little Gibbon for me at the zoo!P.S. Every evening at the East entrance to the hotel, just up the first steps, some small fuzzy flowers open up on some of the plants in the garden. I've never been blown away by beautiful flower fragrance before like this. You can smell them before you get to the steps, amazing!! That's Hawaii. Good luck and enjoy your travels.

<Content>Great Location and Choice If You're Not Needing Pampering My partner and I stayed at the Queen Kapiolani for three nights in mid-April 2005. Since we weren't expecting to spend much of our time in Honolulu at the hotel anyway, we were not looking to pay the rates at the newer hotels in Waikiki. Having checked out the reviews here before hand, we were prepared for the worst when we arrived but were pleasantly surprised when we checked in.The room was large, clean and comfortable (we booked a superior ocean view room--1209), we had a good view of the ocean and the location was great--very easy walk to the beach, close enough to the shops and restaurants on the strip that it was convenient but not too noisy and it was easy to get in and out of Waikiki when we rented a car to go to the north shore and leeward side of the island. Around 5 in the morning there were noises from the zoo across the street and there were loading trucks in the alley below our room early in the morning, but neither was really, really disruptive unless you're a really light sleeper (we left all our windows open each night and while I heard the noises, it never really woke me up). The only complaint with the room was that the bathroom was quite dated/run down but it was definitely clean and everything worked.While it is obvious that this is not a brand new hotel (which you could say about most of the hotels in Waikiki), the common areas were all clean and the staff were friendly. The in-hotel restaurant looked a bit dodgy, but there were lots of other choices close by anyway. There was a water sport equipment rental place in the lobby which was quite convenient and reasonable.If you are going to Waikiki to spend a good chunk of your days in the hotel, the Queen Kapiolani probably isn't where you want to go. But, if you're like us and are going to be spending your time on the beach, in the water, out at restaurants or touring the island and really only sleeping and showering at the hotel, the Queen Kapiolani is a fine choice.

<Content>A run-down decor with a fabulous view This was our first trip to Hawaii...we were staying three nights in Honolulu, followed by four in Maui. We had a partial ocean view, and I have to say that we had no complaints about the scenery- gorgeous view, with the mountain and ocean from the lanai. However, the lanai is tiny and the room, although adequate size for the money, had wallpaper that had been put up in a really sloppy manner. It was nice to be a block or so from the beach but even though we may have been on the quieter end of the strip, it was still a bit noisy on the weekend. We were awakened two of the nights by rowdy people outside and could hear the noise of traffic and trucks.The other complaint was that every little thing cost money...they left a coffee pot and what looked like complimentory coffee, yet a sign said each bag used would cost $1.50 extra. One morning we tried it, being desparate, and it was pretty bad and had to throw it out! However, the staff behind the main desk were always helpful and friendly. We also liked the open lobby, very nice. This hotel did have it's good points, but we personally wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful Value - Good for GLBT Customers If you are used to the Ritz-Carlton and the W Hotel, then this place is not for you. But, if you want a wonderful bargain right in the heart of Waikiki, this is great! And if you are a GLBT customer, you are right next door to Hula's and across the street from Queen's Surf Beach. I would definitely stay again. I got a great deal too. Stay 3 nights and get the 4th night free.

<Content>Its good place to stay I was very happy with my stay at the Queen Kapiolani. We booked our package 3 months in advance and got a super good deal, I would say that our room cost around $60.00/per night Canadian. Which gave us lots of funds leftover to rent a Jeep Wrangler for the week, get a massage by the pool at the Marriot hotel, have a nice buffet lobster dinner and watch the Society of Seven at the Outrigger, Dress up to lounge and have drinks at the W hotel, have dinner at the patio by the beach at Dukes, visit the Polynesian Cultural center and enjoy the high energy show at the Luau, Go shopping at the mall and outlets.... I was'nt expecting very much about the room, Im just going to take a shower and sleep there. There are some advantages to staying at an older hotel like this. The standard rooms are bigger than the standard rooms of newer hotels. The bathroom is clean. There are no molds or soap scum in the tub and the sink. The room is very clean. The location is what I like best about this hotel. In the morning I go to starbucks, get myself a cup of coffee and a muffin and go accross the street to the beach. You are very close to waikiki beach not even a block away. And there are so many ABC stores where you can get water, and stuff to munch on. I had the best time in Waikiki. I will definitely go back and I will stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Good location We Stayed at the Queen Kapiolani for the second time in four years with our kids.(Mar 31-Apr10) This hotel has a good location and for the money,it,s hard to beat. For our family we had a Ocean/Diamond Head view ,kitchenette room. It had great views, and a small nice lani. The room was clean,however the beds were shot We did see some rooms getting new beds while we were there. It would also be nice if they would replace the 2-burner out-dated stove with a microwave. Other than needing some paint to spruce things up, it is still a nice hotel to stay at. The pool gets sun all day, unlike most hotels in Waikiki. There was always room at the pool. We did not use the resturant. Beach is short walk away. We would stay there again. Nice frendly Staff.

<Content>Great Deal We stayed end of February 2005 and were very pleased; comfortable beds, great corner room, FANTASTIC breakfast buffet, and I must be blind, but saw no stained carpets or shabby walls. The service was good, location exactly what we wanted. The zoo is a bit noisy, but the garbage trucks were worse. Yes, the jalousies don't close very tightly. And the noise was fleeting. 18 yr old thrilled, 55 yr old happy.This was a fantastic deal for those on a budget- we took the car-room combo. Parking was not a problem. The elevators were fine.I do think getting an upper floor room was good advice, taken from another reviewer.Went from here to far more expensive Big Island resort (Fairmont Orchid); slept just as well here, and had just as much fun. It's the beach, and the snorkeling, and the scenery.

<Content>Good for the money, but definitely a budget hotel We stayed here because we couldn't find a condo at a reasonable price in Waikiki. The loocation is good- across from the zoo, and two blocks to Waikiki Beach, but at the end of the Waikiki strip (quieter end).It was OK for the price, but it is a budget hotel, and don't expect a resort experience.

<Content>Take my advice - Don't stay at the Queen Kapiolani I should have read the reviews of the Queen Kapiolani before we booked our vacation. I now agree with all the bad reviews previously written. My wife and I checked out after only one night and went to the Ohana East Hotel which was great. Thankfully the walk-in rate at the Ohana East was only $99. My wife describes the Queen Kapiolani hotel as a hole which I completely agree with and we even had a so-called upgraded ocen view room. The hall carpets are stained on all floors, the walls appear to not have been painted in years, anything metal is covered in corrosion, the windows are the old style glass slats that do not close tight and allow all noises to come in from the park across the street. The noise kept us awake most of the night as we listened to the arguing of the druggies and/or drunks that sleep in the park. In addition, the bed was probably one of the most uncomfortable I have ever found in a hotel. Too bad the hotel looks so good from the outside. Anyway, save your money and stay anywhere else!!!!!!!

<Content>Terrific Location, Terrific Price We just came back after spending 10 days in Hawaii--5 nights at the Queen Kapiolani. I usually like the nicer hotels and was very nervous about the QK after reading some of the reviews. But we tried it and I loved it! The price was amazing, the location can't be beat (especially at that price) and the view from our room was stunning! We had a completely unobstructed view of Diamond Head outside our large window and an ocean view from the lanai. The room wasn't fancy, but it was quite clean and even had a small refrigerator. I would definitely upgrade to the deluxe ocean/Diamond Head view rooms--for $75, they can't be beat. We looked at the city view rooms and they seemed a bit depressing--older furnishings inside and dirty city outside. The hotel is older and looks dingiest in the hallways. We also tried the restaurant for dinner one night and it was abominable! Slooooowww service and hideous food. At least three diners sent their food back to the kitchen while we were there. There are so many reasonably priced places to eat in Waikiki that I wouldn't waste any time on the restaurant. I never thought I would rate a budget hotel above average, but given the price, views and cleanliness of the rooms, the QK deserves an above average rating.

<Content>Great Experience We just spent 8 nights at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel and I was pleasantly surprised. I read the reviews before I left so I wasn't sure that our decision to stay there was wise. But what we found was far superior to the negative reviews we read prior to departure. I'm not sure what the folks who wrote them expected from a moderately priced hotel or what attitudes they took with them, but our experiences were totally different.  We found the front desk help very accomodating and always there to answer a question or be of help. The lines were never long and there was not one request that was not addressed courteously and efficiently.  We had a larger group (9 people and 4 rooms) so there were issues that a couple wouldn't have and they tried hard to meet our needs in every way. The maid service is a bit slow but the rooms were always spotlessly clean and we never found any dirty bathrooms, leaky pipes or soiled carpets. There were extra outlets added near the tables for the electronics everyone now has that require charging and there is a small fridge in each room for drinks. There is a hairdryer in each room and housekeeping will bring an iron and board at your request. The hotel is older and there are things that show some wear but the rooms are well kept and large and bright. We had one room on the 7th floor with a small kitchenette and 3 rooms on the 14th floor, one in the corner which is nice with extra windows. Each room had a lanai and the tradewinds could be enjoyed from each door. The hotel could not be in a better location. It is across the street from the zoo which means the traffic isn't as bad is if you were in the center of the beach area and the freeway is not far and easy to find. We never had trouble finding parking in their lot for our 2 rented vehicles and the cost of $8 per night is average.  The hotel food is affordable but nothing special. The buffet breakfast at $6.50 beats McDonalds prices and is the same caliber. The selections are not lavish but it is kept well stocked and the food is palatable. We did not eat lunch or dinner there. My one complaint is the travel desk. It is operated by Expedia and I felt like the agent who booked our tours was more interested in the money he would make on our business than putting us on trips that would work best for us. One example is a day trip we booked to Maui. We were required to catch a bus in front of the hotel at 5 AM and catch the first flt. of the AM to Maui. It put us there 1 hr. 45 min. before the tour began. There were others on our day tour who were on later flights and not required to leave so early or wait so long. We had elderly people with us and this was very hard for them and could have been avoided. I can only believe he made more money on this itinerary due to the early flight. Another time, after we had booked all our trips, we asked him to mark the best route to an attraction from the hotel and he acted very irritated and said he didn't have time to show us on our larger map and scribbled on a tiny map out of an ad flyer showing partially how to get there, but without the detail of streets. Left with a very bad feeling about him. All in all, I can say that this is the best buy available on Waikiki Beach. The location is wonderful and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an affordable vacation spot, 2 minutes walking to the beach, in a beautiful setting with the green of the zoo and Diamond Head in the background. We plan to go back next year and only hope the hotel and weather are as perfect as last week!

<Content>Waht You Can See Is What You Get Despite what others have written, it's not really all that bad. True, it's an older hotel. But it's location is excellent and if you can get a view of Diamond Head, it'll make your stay! The zoo, beach, and Kapiolani Park are just a few mintues walk away!There's an outdoor pool which doesn't get much use, with an adjoining breakfast cafe. My observation was that the tour groups were mostly eating the breakfast. Actually, it's more fun to stroll down one of the two major streets in the early morning and find a breakfast special.What might turn some vistors off are the older furnishings, loud air conditioner, and potential rustling of the blinds from the wind gusts. But if you get a budget price, these characteristics should be no problem.A tip - use the new E-transit across the street to hook up with Ala Moana, Chinatown, Aloha Tower, and the Ward Centers

<Content>unbelievable views! I have stayed in this hotel twice now, and I think the delux, ocean-view rooms, when booked through orbitz, might be the best deal in Wakiki. We paid $80/night for a room with unobstructed views of diamond head and the ocean from our nice lanai. It was clean, quiet, and not small. Everything worked in the room, there was a small refrigerator, and the staff at the hotel is pretty nice. Its true that I figured they would have replaced the terrible carpeting in the halls by now, but how much time do you spend in the halls of the hotel? It is also inarguable that the buffet is pretty bad, but it only costs $7 for a breakfast buffet (no charge for our four year old son), which included edible fruit, toast, eggs, and miso soup. My husband actually ate there by choice because he liked the staff so much (and he isn't picky). Personally I prefered picking up some Hawaiian bread and yogurt at one of the three ABC stores in a two block radius of the hotel. The location is AMAZING- especially if you like the park, zoo, aquarium, or just some open green space. Plus you are one block from a great part of the beach. We really like this hotel, but as others have said, it isn't for everyone. I agree with the laid back Canadians who posted the previous review (and didn't I see the two of you, happily reading by the lovely pool each day?) There were certainly several happy Canadians in evidence when we were there in mid December. Actually, everyone we met at the hotel seemed to be having an excellent time, and I can't say that about the Sheraton Waikiki, where we also stayed.

<Content>Don't be so Picky!!! I can't believe all of the bad reviews on this hotel!!! I thought that it was fine. When we checked in the staff at the front desk were a little difficult to understand, but they were very friendy. It was clean, quiet and we were able to relax there at night which was exactly what we wanted!!The buffet was not that good and the fact that the big bed was two twin sized beds put together was not really romantic, but I can make the best out of anything, especially something as trivial as the beds. The restaurant was horrible, but there are so many other restaurants to try while you are there that it is best to not eat at the hotel that you are staying at the entire time that you are there.The location was wonderful. We were a 5min walk from the international market, a block from the beach, across the street from the zoo (I didn't hear the animals at night!) and right outside of the hotel was the bus stop where you could catch the bus to anywhere (Honolulu, Diamond Head, Tour of Oahu). You could literally walk to honolulu if you wanted to, we did, but we enjoyed it because there was so much to see along the way that we thought that it didn't take that long to get there!There were no bugs, the sheets were clean, floors were clean, fridge worked, hot water everyday. No complaints that way.BUT! If you are used to the ritz, do not stay there. It is for the laid back people (like most of us canadians). If it bothers you to stay in an older hotel, or if you want to eat at the hotel restaurant everyday or are used to sleeping like the princess and the pea, don't stay there. But if you want a cheap place, a good location to get you around the awesome island of hawaii that will keep you warm at night, close to the beach and restaurants in the morning and just want a clean place to stay cheap, stay there! For me, it wouldn't have been worth the extra money to stay at a fancier hotel because I was never in my room, I was always off seeing the wonders of Hawaii. That is what you are there for right??? Paradise!!! Paradise is not in your room, it is in the earth...and the people around you.....My advise to all of you, have a great time. Most people don't get to go to Hawaii, it is a dream for most. So enjoy it. Explore the beauty that Hawaii has to offer you, you definately can't do that from your hotel room. Have Fun!!! Most of all!!!From a Laid Back Canadian!!!! Dreaming to go back to Hawaii!!

<Content>You get what you pay for Don't expect too much, just remember that the price you paid is more for location, and not for the actual accomodations. It is a very short walk to the beach and all shopping locations. A good remodeling is long overdue, or maybe just a really good cleaning. I definitely agree, in it's day, this must have been a really beautiful hotel.

<Content>Not bad at all Just got back today......other than the rain, everything else was great. Stayed in Room 1514 (partial ocean/Diamondhead view). Room was very clean, average size, with nice patio (lanai) section to hang your wet towels/shoes to dry. Parking is a real joke, if you have a rental car....parking garage very congested, but manageable. GREAT location to less crowded section of beach, at beginning of the shopping mecca on Waikiki Beach. I'd recommend this place, especially for the money as compared to most on or around Waikiki Beach.....then again, after reading some of the reviews, I guess I'd ask to see the room before definitely making my mind up. Our room was fine, with 4 adults staying in two double beds. No problems with air conditioner -- as a matter of fact, it froze us out on a few occasions.

<Content>Happy with the Queen Kapiolani We were pleased with our recent stay at the Queen Kapiolani. We were in Honolulu for a wedding, so we arrived with our son, daughter, daughter-in-law and seven grandchildren ages eight and under! The desk clerks checked us in quickly and efficiently and saw that we had adjoining rooms.Our rooms were clean and comfortable--and certainly more spacious than some we have stayed in at other Honolulu hotels in the past. We liked the location of the Queen Kapiolani: an easy walk from the beach, plenty of shopping and food choices close at hand, satisfactory parking. The pool was clean, quiet and pleasant for the kids. For the price (very reasonable in comparison to other Waikiki hotels), we were quite satisfied and would return again.

<Content>Very small room and unhelpful front desk staff I was very disappointed to find how small the room was upon my arrival. There was practically no room for luggages for two people and the bed was awfully small. I decided to check with the front dest clerk to see if anything could be done but they were not very helpful. instead of telling me they'll move me as soon as there is an availability in a bigger room, they'll let me know, they told me to come back two nights later to check with them. When I got back to the room, I decided to rest a bit before I hit Waikiki to find the bed was lopsided. As it turned out, the mattress was too small for the rusted metal frame. Too tired to ring the unhelpful front desk, I fixed it myself and try not to let the problem ruin my vacation. I was very disappointed in the hotel and their front desk staffs. Oahu though is such a beautiful place with many things to do that I stayed out most of the time.

<Content>Not my first choice, or even 5th Stayed here October of 2004. Once upon a time this was probably a great hotel. Now it's old, smells musty, desperately needs an overhaul and is on par with your typical roadside stop along an old US highway. It is close to the beach (maybe a 2 minute walk if you're slow) but if you're looking for great lodging this isn't it. Stay here if all you want is a place to sleep that isn't too expensive. If you want anything more, pass on it.

<Content>Queen Kapiolani good deal I liked it. Stayed 12 days from 10-11-04 until 10-23-04. No problems. Very clean and the maid service was the best. But the rooms were rather small.The third floor dining hostess was very pleasant, and I felt the food, especially the prime rib, was great, as were the waiters and cooks. There is a buffet in the morning from 6:30 until 10:00 AM. This was handy and at seven bucks this is a good deal when it's all-you-can-eat.It is sort of a long walk to the middle of Waikiki, but you are at the better end of the beach; the Diamond Head end, and about 500 feet from the beach. And although I had a car, the parking spaces below the hotel are tiny- which makes it (really) difficult to park. It's eight bucks a day too. Although I had plenty of cash, I could have done without the $96 parking bill.You won't need a car unless you travel about the island during the day (but I racked up over 900 miles in 12 days), where the bars close at 4 AM and at that time, you can't drive anyway. However, you can walk to Lewers street to the Irish Rose (for great rock n roll live bands) or to Spinners Bar on Kuhio (for great people and even better bar- tenders)....only a few blocks from the hotel. To eat cheaply, go to Teddy's Bigger Burgers next door to the hotel (opens at 10:00 AM) 9 oz burgers. Starbucks is nearby too (opens at 5:30 am). Also, there is a very nice Regency lunch downstairs on the main drag of Waikiki Beach. Under eleven dollars for lunches (three courses). They have forks too, but you'll have to ask for them.Finally, I dropped off my laundry at Waikiki Laundry (Ena street). They washed AND folded about 50 pounds of my stuff for $19.25, and had it done in a few hours. The best deal on Oahu!In SolidarityJohn Whalen

<Content>You get what you pay for My family and I stayed here only one night enroute to Maui. We booked the $70 internet special since we would only be there to sleep (arrived late in the evening and left early the next morning). It was OK for the one night and the price was right. The room was exceptionally small with a double bed and single placed in an L shape. I would recommend this as a cheap one night stay but not for someone wanting to come and stay a week in Waikiki with a family. The location is good.

<Content>Gave it a try Despite some pretty poor reviews, I thought I'd give this hotel a chance after taking advice offered from previous guests. I booked my sister and brother-in-law in for 3 nights(and was with them whenever they were in the room, except at night) in late September, 2004; and unfortunately, the weather was hotter and more humid than usual. The room had an excellent view(#1010-a corner room) of the beach, the park, and Diamond Head. The location is excellent...away from the busiest part of Waikiki, and less than a block from the beach. On the negative side was the air-conditioner. Despite the AC unit being replaced 3 times by new units, it never gave out enough air to cool the room, which I thought was very odd. We closed all the windows, but still no luck. There are lots of windows to open, but with it being so hot, with not much in the way of tradewinds, it was unbareable. They didn't have any fans, which would have helped somewhat. Also, the bed was not comfortable...when you laid on one side, the other side lifted up! All the staff(maintenance, housekeeping, bell desk, etc.)seemed very nice and helpful; but I think the front desk/reception could do with a bit more of the aloha that Hawai'i is known for. I will say the manager was friendly and professional, but wasn't able to correct the AC problem. The pool area was nice and on the 3rd floor...above the street noise. The price was certainly right(found it on-line), but if you don't like being awaken early by the birds, I'd try to find another place(it's right across from the zoo)!

<Content>Ok, if you don't expect too much We spent 5 nights in the Queen Kapiolani Hotel and it was ok. Thanks to the reviews we knew it wouldn't be 'all that' so we knew what to expect. The location of the QP is perfect, near the beach, and when you have a seaview room (like we did) you have wonderfull view. Besides that it's old and at some places it looks dirty. I dont think the staff was very nice'or helpfull but I think that depends on who helped you. I thought it was strange that we couldn't get a room with one bed instead of two smaller beds, we booked the hotel in january! Next time I'll stay in another (more expensive) hotel, but it really depends on what you expect and how you spend your holiday!

<Content>A nice, inexpensive getaway hotel... I spent 3 nights at the QK. It is not fancy by anymeans; however, the staff was most pleasant, and helpful with giving directions, etc. It is in a perfect location, away from the hustle-bustle of Waikiki, and across the street is the zoo. 1/4 of a block and you're on the beach. The room I selected was the most budget you can get--no balcony. However, when I travel I don't spend alot of time in the room. It was clean, and functional, but nothing elaborate; however for 48.00 a night, I was not complaining (airline rate). The pool is located on the 3rd floor, was clean, and not crowded, but, we all prefer the beach, right? Would I stay there again? Definitely! The City Bus stops right out front of the hotel, and makes trips to Alamoana Shopping center; Golds gym or return trip to the airport a breeze.

<Content>great hotel good value We stayed at Queen Kap for 11nights to the 09 sept 04. It was great we requested an ocean view studio with kitchenette. The room was on the 8th floor had a view of diamond head, beach, pool and zoo!! It was old but clean and very comfortable, and reasonably priced with every 5th night free and free buffets thrown in everyday too! Check their websites for specials. We will be staying there again its old but good and staff are friendly but request a room with a view and pay the extra! Mahalo

<Content>Stay Somewhere Else Unfortunately, all the negative things stated here are very very true! We spent four nights at the Queen Kapiolani and had to switch rooms three times b/c the rooms were horrid. Originally, we booked a Superior non-smoking room. Of course, the room reeked of smoke when we got there. They offered to sanitize the room. Sanitizing = spraying alcohol in the room. The room was dirty (definitely wouldn't walk around barefoot) and the bed slept horribly. We ended up being moved to a room that smelled of mildew. In the middle of the night, a pipe broke and flooded the bathroom, so we were moved to a third room. Finally, after all our troubles we were upgraded to a King size (which we originally requested) with a very nice view.All in all, if you're hoping to enjoy a nice, relaxing, peaceful vacation, stay somewhere else. If you're definitely planning on staying here...at least do yourself a favor and request an ocean view room.

<Content>Room category is critical We spent a week at the Queen in September of 2003. Room 1711(2 doubles) has a stunning, dead-on view of Diamond Head with the ocean an added bonus just off to the right. The room had a coffeemaker, fridge and lanai for all of $90. The hotel is old and looks it, but that in no way detracts from its excellent location on the quieter side of Waikiki, heavenly views and the beach half a block away. The key to a pleasant experience at the Queen is to book an ocean view deluxe room; the few extra dollars spent don't stand a chance when compared with what awaits as you pull back the drapes.

<Content>happy with a room change We were originally booked in room 508, a superior room, which was small, smelly, and was in dire need of a fix up. We upgraded to room 1212 with Diamond head and ocean view and were quite pleased. The location was great, however the variance between condition of the rooms was as well.

<Content>Convenient location in a fading hotel We stayed at the Queen Kap recently and, although we loved the location of the hotel, we found problems with the facilities. We had 2 rooms (904 and 905) and the air conditioner in one was so loud as to disturb sleep at night. The elevators were having trouble and we experienced long waits. Considering everything it wasn't too bad because of the location and the price. Loved the area - loved Honolulu - but you might want to look for a newer property.

<Content>Beautiful View and Clean Room This hotel is in a wonderful location. We had a oceanview room on the 15th floor room 1561 just in case anyone would like to request that room! The window faced waikiki beach and we also had a partial view of the zoo so it was a really nice landscape as well. Plus, if you planning to use Thebus there is a pickup right by the hotel that will take you to the mall, the Sea park, and Hanauma Bay which I recommend stopping at if you like to snorkel or just relax on the beach. Just a warning for people this is a very old resort, but most of the resorts on waikiki were built in the 60's so be prepared for a few rundown things. The rooms are clean though sheets, towels, and things of that nature were changed everyday. If you plan to sleep in it may be hard depending on where at because the rooms are not very quiet, best bet would be to stay on the higher floors, but if you're looking just for a place to sleep, shower, and get ready and just enjoy the rest of your day out you will have great time!!! Oh, one more thing there is a buffet style restaurant called Big D's inside there, I don't recommend the breakfast, but we never went for dinner though. They advertised from pretty cheap meals for dinner. Mon-Fri they offer prime rib for 10.95 that include a few sides and a beverage as well.

<Content>Good Deal on an Older Hotel I returned to the Queen for 7 nights in July, 2004. It's perfect for me, as it is one short block to the beach. The age of the building reminds me of the old Holiday Inns with a few cracked bathroom tiles, scuffed walls, and chipped doors, but my home looks in the same condition. I walk through as many other hotels as I can to compare, and I would put the Queen at the top of the moderate priced hotels. During low season, last year, I paid less than $50/night, but this summer every room in Honolulu was filled as the Japanese have resumed visiting. The dining room is okay, but there are so many dining options in Honolulu if you ask the staff for suggestions. My all time favorite is the Tiki just a block away. Ask the ladies in the parking garage for low-cost options. The gift shop in the hotel has the same products as an ABC store, at the same prices, plus a better variety of clothing. I could see some people being bothered by street noise if they are on the lower floors, so just go back to the desk, and ask to be changed if the room doesn't need your needs. If you are lucky, you might get an unblocked view of the park, Diamond Head, and the beach.

<Content>Good Budget Stay in Waikiki We stayed at the Queen Kap for five days in June 2004. My parents had a corner room on the 12th floor, with a spectacular view of Diamond Head and the beach. We had reserved a kitchenette, but they initially put us in a double. Half-an-hour later they moved us up to a mountain-view suite on the penthouse floor--so we saw three rooms. All were clean and in reasonable condition--not fancy, and there were some seams in the wallpaper that were starting to come up, but overall they were fine. Our 19th floor suite was huge, and gave our two young kids a great spaced in which to spread out. The common areas are as described in other reviews--they are in need of work, but show signs of past glory. The location-on the park and near the beach-is great.The drain in the kitchen was stopped up when we arrived, but they had it fixed in less than an hour. The fold-out sofa bed didn't work, but we decided we didn't need it, and told them not to worry about fixing it.We booked the zooper special on the internet, and got breakfast and zoo passes thrown in. The food and service were good, and the pool area was clean, with a good view. We had no trouble finding the guest laundry, which is in garage across from the steps to the lobby. The zoo (across the street) has a nice variety of animals, with a petting zoo and playground our kids enjoyed. No one was disturbed by animal noises or odors.The biggest downside was that the hotel caters to teen tour groups, and after nine in the evenings the elevators and lobby were frequently filled with inebriated, sometimes profane, college-age kids. All in all, it was comfortable and clean, any problems were promptly adressed, and the price and location were right,. We would certainly be willing to return.

<Content>The Queen is great We stayed at the Queen from the 8th thru 15th of June. The hotel guest service was great. We saved and upgraded to the penthouse floor (19th) with a Diamond Head/partial ocean view. Maid service was really good every day. In their garden room restaurant we enjoyed a good breakfast buffet and had their ala carte lunch and dinner menu service a couple times. The waiters were excellent each time. The convenience of having our scheduled tours come right to the hotel, having an ABC store on the corner, a small gift shop within the hotel and a secure parking garage for our rental car was really nice to have. We did not have any odors from the zoo or noise from the beach tourists during our stay there. We enjoyed hearing the birds and monkeys in the morning after sunrise. We also had a terrific view of the parades during the holiday weekend while we were there. We would definitely stay there again and recommend this hotel to our friends.

<Content>Not the worst palce to stay in Waikiki Yes, she's old, Yes, she's worn, but if you are looking for a cheap sleep (under $60.00) and you like the park area, the Queen will do. Being single I don't need a fancy place to sleep. Stayed 8 nights in April 04. Was a little disappointed at first but got over it. Pool area was better then I expected. Bar/restuarant was reasonable and the food was not too bad. Rooms were small and in need of updating. Housekeeping was acceptable. Now that I know what to expect, I would stay again, in fact I am now planning my next trip to the islands for October.

<Content>Don't believe any of the good reviews! They're wrong. We stayed at the Queen Kapiolani in February 2004. This is absolutely the worst, most run down hotel I have ever stayed in. We had an upgraded superior room... the bed was a rock, the AC made noise all night, the bathroom was a deteriorated wreck, and the rest of the hotel was in a state of disrepair and outdated. YES, the location is great and the views of Diamond Head over the zoo and the park are wonderful, but saving a couple of bucks is not worth the sacrifice of staying here. We spent two days trying to find another hotel, but were stuck with this fleabag. We were afraid to try any of the on-site food service. Stay away!

<Content>Best Ocean Deal in Town I stayed at Queen Kap for my first trip to Hawaii. It was a perfect trip! We stayed in the ocean view hotel room, and loved it. There was a full South wall facing the ocean and the East wall was a full view of Diamondhead. If you are looking for a very affordable hotel room for two, with the best ocean views, stay here. Request a room on a higher floor - ours was fifteenth floor I believe. You could hear the zoo at night, but being higher up eliminated most road and pool noise. If you stay here, you must get the full ocean view. It's worth the extra few bucks. It's what made the trip so awesome for us. That and being so close to the beach.

<Content>A balanced Review How to rate the Kap--it all depends on what you expect. If you are looking for a resort or a hotel that you want to spend lots of time in, then the Kap is not for you. However, if you are looking for a budget hotel that is conveniently located, then the Kap might be great for you.My wife and I spent 6 days/nights at the Kap over the Memorial day holiday. Our balcony overlooked the zoo and Kapiolani park, and Diamond Head was directly across from us (quite beautiful to see when you wake up in the A.M.). The room was certainly worn, but I wouldn't classify it as a dump or fleabag hotel. (After traveling in S. America and Europe, the Kap is not bad at all).Look, it's an older hotel that, judging by the old chandeliers, paintings, etc., appears to have had a much more distinguished past. To us, this just made the place a little more charming. Then again, we weren't expecting the Sheraton. So, again, it all depends upon what you expect; if you expect alot, you'll be disappointed. If you don't expect much, you'll be delighted. My only tips: (1) Choose at least a deluxe room (the standard ones are small, noisy, and don't have balconies), and request one facing Diamond Head; (2) If you want cheap eats, the grilled ham  cheese in the bar/restaurant is best I've ever had (surprise!); (3) The Mai Tais are the best I had (much better than those at expensive bars and hotels) and are only $4.

<Content>left after 15 min. My son and I booked in as part of a package, we had requested two beds, non-smoking. We arrived around midnight and told there were no non-smoking rooms. Once shown to the room it was a nightmare. Stains on the ceiling, only 1 bed and there were people lying in the hallway. We went back to the front desk and they tried to find us a different room. We were shown another room with two beds , still a smoking room but there were people partying in the hallway on this floor as well. When I asked to use the phone to call another hotel, I was told to use the payphone in the lobby. The next morning, my travel agent booked us into the Ohana Lanai and we had a wonderful vacation. Be warned - the queen is far from royal.

<Content>Needs to be updated. We stayed at the Queen Kap for 9 days over March Break. Got a great deal on an oceanview/diamondhead view room. The Queen Kap is in a great location near the park and beach(about 1 block) and much quieter than on the main hotel strip which makes this really convenient and quiet. The hotel is o.k if you're not picky. It needs to be updated (carpet, paint) and the showers I found were short. Have fun if you're tall!! The maid service was nice, fresh towels everyday and sheets changed and they were very friendly. I'd recommend staying there if you don't mind that the hotel needs an update. After all you don't go to Hawaii to spend all day in your hotel room!!!! ;)

<Content>We _liked_ the location by the zoo! Well, I guess it all depends on what you expect.This hotel is quite affordable. But you really want a lanai to appreciate Hawai'i properly. We always get kitchenettes with a lanai facing Diamond Head. And we also enjoy the birds and gibbons calling in the morning - it is a big plus for us!I know some people are turned off by the state of repair of the hotel. Well, we lived in Honolulu for many years before moving to the mainland. Trust me, folks, this place is not in bad shape at all. The constant pounding by wind, sun, and rain really takes it toll on buildings here, and it is very hard to keep anything as pristine as it is on the mainland (particularly the paint and wallpaper). Take a trip outside Waikiki and see how the rest of the island lives. I think the place is clean and in reasonably good shape.

<Content>a happy place I was hesitant to stay here since the reviews were a little rough. But, Am so glad we did. It is prime location. We upgraded to a ocean view room and that is exactly what we got. We enjoyed the view of the ocean and diamond head every day. Everything was with in walking distance, it was great. The zoo is awesome and should be a spot to see. it looks small from the outside we spent 4hours walking through it enjoying all the animals we could see. Its well worth the trip, and so is the aquarium! It is true that the hotel could be updated but let me tell you I'd rather spend the money sight seeing and enjoyed my clean room!!!! I would stay there again.....

<Content>Location is Good We stayed 10 nights end of March 2,004. Good location for walking downtown Waikiki Beach area. Staff is good. Rooms are in very dire need of updating. Our room had two large stains on the ceiling. Maid service was marginal. Some days coffee was not replaced, some days I couldn't tell whether the sheets had been changed. Sofa had rips along the seams and a lamp bulb burned out that was never replaced in our 10 night stay. Shower was very slow to drain. Budget property that was sufficient, but sure nothing fancy. Economical since I didn't want to spend all my money on hotel. Would stay again. I think the guest hotel parking should be free. Guest laundry room rather difficult to find.

<Content>Reasonable, clean, close to the beach We spent 7 nights in latter part of March. The Queen badly needs updating-paint, sinks, carpeting, etc. but it was clean  extremely close to everything: 1/2 block to the beach, next to the Park, Zoo, Denny's  other restaurants. Traffic is very noisy at Waikiki, no matter where we walked. Our room was a corner  very quiet. We never did hear our neighbors at all. Buffets in in-house restaurant were generous  reasonably priced. One thing we did not like was that our room was never cleaned until after 3 pm each day--do they need more housekeeping help??? We would stay here again, simply because of the proximity to the beach--which by the way is much less crowded at this end of the beach (Diamond Head) versus further toward downtown.

<Content>Bird Hell This hotel is the pits!! We read the reviews but were hoping to save money so we figured, it couldn't be THAT bad, right?! WRONG!!!!!The room (which was a free upgrade-or was it-I can't imagine anything smaller) was filthy, cramped and noisy. When we first got there, we thought that we could rough it and stick it out. The linens on the bed were clean, we were exhausted and it was about 1am, so we thought what the heck and decided to go to sleep. That's when it started. CAW, CAW, CAW-all night at about 1 minute intervals!! The bird cages from the zoo were right outside our window (and we were on the 11th floor). We could not sleep all night. Add to the birds the noise from the street and you can forget sleeping here. That's why even if you are trying to save money and figure that you will only use the room for sleeping in-forget it. I would rather sleep on the beach with the homeless guys than stay at this place again!! I know that some people have said that the hotel is okay, but it's not. If you think you want to try it despite my warnings, at least do yourself a favour and only book for one night and then see whether you can stick it out. (We left after one night and had a wonderful PEACEFUL stay at another hotel for the rest of out trip).
