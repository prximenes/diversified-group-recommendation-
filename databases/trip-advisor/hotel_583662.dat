<Content>Ideal Hotel for Your Trip to Paris Our time at the Villa Modigliani was excellent. Traveling with my wife (we are both in our 50's), my son (20) and my Dad (age 72), I was nervous about what to expect from this little charmer. But it delivered! The rooms were small, but clean and modern, with plenty of closet space. The front desk staff was very helpful and pleasant in answering all our questions (in English). The buffet breakfast provided everything we needed - fruit, bread, cereal, juice, coffee, bacon, sausage, and outstanding scrambled eggs.The hotel is set back off the street, and we missed it the first time we walked by. But after finding the sign, we walked thru a short passageway to an open courtyard that leads to the front door. The Modigliani's location is superb. It is in Montparnasse, and 50 yards down to the end of the block you will discover that you are standing in front of the world famous bistros La Dome, La Coupole and La Rotonde. Go the other direction ( the street is only 2 blocks long) and there is another corner full of cafes and bistros. The street, Rue Delambre, also has bars, restaurants, and small shops. We had dinner across the street from the hotel one night at the Venice restaurant and it was reasonable and delicious. The Metro has stations at both ends of the street - one takes you to Cite and Notre Dame, the other takes you to the Eiffel Tower.We highly recommend the Villa Modigliani and will stay here again if we ever get back to Paris.

<Content>Great location FAntastic location near Metro stations, wonderful/charming neighborhood. Hotel is quaint and clean. Rooms are typical European - small but comfortable. Hotel staff were cordial and helpful. I would certainly return and recommend it highly.

<Content>Loved It! We booked this following looking for budget hotels through expedia and comparing these to the reviews found here.This was the only hotel within budget and had a great rating so we went for it.What is not to like about this hotel? The room was lovely, air conditioning worked fine, a digital safe in the room, a fridge free to use, reception really helpful and the location could not be better.We had breakfast every morning (there were two of us for three nights), which was exactly what we hoped from a buffet breakfast in a hotel, and set us up for a busy day in Paris.The street is quiet, with being set back, and has a metro station at each end. Each of these metros lead in to different areas of Paris, and also connect to the main interchange one station away which takes you to all of Paris. If you don't want to use the metro it is only a twenty five minute walk to the Seine in any direction, but we bought the three day unlimited travel tickets through expedia and used them all day long.This part of Montparnasse has restaurants, creperies and bars within one minute of the hotel, all friendly and open late. There are two supermarkets nearby for anything you may need, and a bank on the corner for the cash withdrawals you will inevitably need to make!We will return soon, as we genuinely cannot see us finding a better hotel without paying a premium for this.

<Content>Nasty Cramped Dirty Rooms, Awful Food, Terrible Service The street and area are fabulous and interesting, the location is fantastic, but there are many other hotels to choose from just down a few doors and all around. The rooms in this hotel were appalling. The hotel website shows a pristine, lovely flowered courtyard, but that is not where you'll be sleeping! Very misleading impression. The rooms are dingy, worn, tired, old--doesn't begin to describe it. Depressing and desperately in need of being torn down. The bathtub had deeply ingrained dirt and grime. And the courtyard doesn't have those flowers and accents that are so beautiful on the website, it has rubbish and ashtrays filled to the brim and empty cans. The breakfast is just awful, and the service is quite insulting: the waiters spend their time laughing and sneering AT the guests, and making snide remarks about them--if you speak French it's a revelation. The front desk service is no better: they claim they don't know the area and could not suggest a cafe or a way around. The transportation that they booked and that they use regularly for the airport was life threatening. Most of the other guests were on group tours. Avoid this hotel and stay somewhere basic but nice and clean.

<Content>Not great, but certainly okay This hotel is reasonably well-situated, and it's facade being through a courtyard entrance gives it a feeling of being somewhat secluded in a truly busy area of Paris. Lots of neat restaurants and little shopping boutiques nearby, and only a couple blocks from the suprisingly clean Paris subway system are added benefits.On the negative side:-Lots of bleedover noise from other patrons-Baggage room is too easily accessible to people who might have plans of theft.-Furnishings in room are pretty spartan and plain.-Shampoos, soaps, etc are very tiny and not of a particularly good quality.Among the pluses:-Good location (close to train station also)-Friendly staff-Rooms were basic, but clean-Price, given the city and area, was reasonable-Very respectable breakfast buffet, with lots of American foods (eggs and bacon, etc)-Small refrigerator in room (rare in Paris hotels)-Very nice courtyard area that provides some semblence of privacy from the bustle of Paris and is great for drinking an evening coffee or beer and visiting with friends. (Beware however, of LOTS of smokers in the courtyard at times!)All in all, a hotel I'm glad I stayed in and would happily use as a Fall back location on a future trip. Nothing memorable, but fairly budget-consciouss and perfectly decent for a short stay.

<Content>Absolutely Charming Very clean. Great location, very convenient. Half a block from 2 major subway lines. Reasonable price. Never ate a meal there because the area is swarming with great choices. Perfect stay.Note - if you leave your luggage (prior to check-in or after check-out), they simply give you the key to a secured room that every other guest holding bags has access to. The room is really a closet.

<Content>Excellent experience We have stayed in numerous hotels in Paris and this was the best yet. Situated around two courtyards, the hotel was quiet but very convenient for the metro, superb restaurants and some interesting places to visit. The staff were friendly, spoke good English and tolerated our shaky French and the rooms, although quite small, were very clean and well equipped inc satellite TV. The included breakfast was generous and with a wide selection of food, inc English breakfast.The area of Montparnasse is clean and friendly and there are many good places to eat. We particularly like the traditional French food at Parnasse 138 at 138 Rue du Montparnasse, which was 5 minutes walk from the hotel. There are some excellent seafood restaurants, with garcons standing outside preparing oysters, crabs, mussels etc for these huge platters of seafood. Not cheap, but you can get an excellent croquette of moules, plus frites and bread for around 20 Euros per head inc wine.Do visit Jardin du Luxembourg just 10 minutes walk away and take some baguettes, cheese etc, all obtainable from the boulangerie and the supermarche along the street from the hotel.

<Content>Decent hotel, great location I spent two weekends at Villa Modigliani in 2007 and would recommend it as a (relatively) inexpensive place to stay while in a very expensive city. It's very close to the Metro in an area with many restaurants, especially if you love crepes. There's also a bustling outdoor market on Saturdays with a wide variety of foods (meat, fruit, baked goods) and knick knacks available. The rooms at Villa Modigliani are small, particularly the sleeping area, with little clearance around the bed, no sitting area or work space. The bathroom areas (separate toilet stall) were relatively clean and spacious. Wireless internet worked in the room, but was expensive by US standards (17 Euros from noon to noon). Safe was too small for a laptop. Bathroom amenities were a couple of small soaps so bring your own shampoo. Only one English language TV station (CNN International), which essentially shows an endless loop of the same stories over and over. No clock or radio in the room.Service was a bit lackluster. One morning when I slept in housekeeping arrived and made it clear that I had 10 minutes to vacate the room because they were coming in to clean. Coming back in the afternoon was apparently not an available option. If you're not planning to spend much time in your hotel room, and are looking for an inexpensive, clean place to stay in a quiet part of town with easy access to the Metro, then Villa Modigliani fits the bill.

<Author>Insightful
<Content>Oasis in Montparnasse Located just off Rue Delambre in a quiet courtyard, this is a lovely hotel. I arrived the weekend of the Ireland-France rugby match, and was greeted warmly by a charming woman at the front desk. My room was a little more compact than I'm used to, but the bathroom was spacious and the shower both powerful and soothing. Especially welcome in killling the hangover I had acquired overnight (when drowning my sorrows in the wake of the Irish defeat in the rugby match at Stade de France).Though I was lucky enough to experience the atmosphere at the stadium, the Villa Modigliani was doing a lot to create a match day atmosphere with a wide-screen television and plenty of flags in the bar.Paris was basking in 25 degrees centigrade of Indian summer and the atmosphere on match weekend was superb. The woman at the front desk of the hotel recommended a fish restaurant called Le Dome, which is at the corner of Rue Delambre. Though the prices were on the high side, the choice of fish and shellfish was diverse and eclectic and the fish soup I consumed there was the best I have ever tasted. The fish is cooked simply and tastefully and the plates are not over-burdened with too much excess vegetable. The aim of Le Dome is to provide you with delicious-tasting fish and to release its natural flavour. Washed down with a glass of chablis, this was a meal to remember. The standard of unobtrusive service was way ahead of anything I have experienced in Dublin or London in recent years.As stated earlier, the Villa Modigliani is located in the Rue Delambre, a haven in the midst of Montparnasse. The street boasts a collection of different delicatessens, wine shops and patisseries. Try the Italian delicatessen, which will serve you a slice of hot pizza or mouth-watering pasta for immediate consumption. A lot of people simply congregate outside the place happily munching away at their pizzas or tasting their pasta dishes.In terms of value for money, the Villa Modigliani is a bargain at 150 Euro a night. Even though the bedroom was not large, I was very comfortable in this hotel and found it to be a very welcoming place.

<Content>My Favorite Hotel in Paris I have stayed in the Villa Modigliani many times when I visit Paris and it is consistently a great travel experience for the price. And, I have recommended it to many friends and relatives, and they all have had the same satisfied experience as I have had. It is a great location - Montparnasse 14 arr., but on the border of the 5th/6th, just a few blocks from Le Jardin du Luxembourg. It is in the midst of a Parisian neighborhood with a farmers market on Wed and Sat's, grocery stores, wine and cheese shops, chocolate shops, clothing, books, health food, etc. The Tour Montparnasse is just a couple of blocks away with all its shopping center stores including Galeries Lafayette and the Gar Montparnasse. It is a hub for most buses and metro lines, as well as RER. It has many internet cafes, although the hotel does have high speed internet connectivity.It is also in the midst of a multitude of restaurants of all ethnic varieties and price ranges - from the fine dining at Le Dome to the neighborhood falafel shops and crepe stands. It is also in the middle of more movie theatres showing all types of films that you can find in downtown Chicago!This is the perfect Paris home base for any type of sightseeing, and a comfortable spot to relax after a day's walking around Paris. The hotel has programs that offer breakfast and/or a second meal as part of their very low room rates which I recommend. Even if you want to eat all your meals out, there will be a night or two where you'll appreciate not having to dress up to go out, and being able to go down to the dining room and have a deliciously prepared, gourmet meal with wine, then go back up to your room and rest your tired legs!

<Content>Good location We selected this hotel for the first night of a 3 day weekend in Paris. The reviews on this web page were generally favorable and I was able to book it via SNCF Voyages - a reliable on-line booking network in France [-]I have to say that Mrs. B and I were both very pleased. Although the hotel is in the 14th arrondisement, it is only 100 meters from the 6th which gives it all the advantages of being close to the Saint Germain and the Luxembourg Gardens but at 14th arr. prices. The rooms are small (but normal for Paris), comfortable and very functional with a sort of no-suprises Holiday-Inn or Hotel Ibis feel to them. I saw this positively as we have had our dose of squeeky Hausmanian floorboards and non-sound proof doors and walls. The bathrooms were clean and spaceous enough. This was pleasant after a long trip. Our room was very quiet and all seemed fitted with central air-conditioning. For eating out, there is a huge choice along the the rue Delambre and just around the corner along Boulevard Montparnasse. The hotel staff were all very efficient and helpful although the hotel has a business travel/bus tour feel to it and so can seem a little impersonal. The hotel has a large, locked bag room where luggage can be stored after check-out.About the only thing we did not like was breakfast. This is served in a windowless ballroom in the basement and tasted rubbery. Next time we will nip out to a caf茅 or brasserie along the Boulevard Montparnasse and eat breakfast there... and watch the world go by... We may well chose this hotel next time we are in Paris and I would be happy to recommend it to anyone. Although it caters for all sorts of clients, I would certainly chose it for a business trip if I wanted something low key, well priced and central.BTW - If you are into French cinema, keep your eyes open in this neighborhood as this is where many of the stars live. Some even jog regularly in the Luxembourg Gardens.Bon s茅jour! HBB

<Content>spot on I used trip advisor to research and book this hotel and what a gem it was. The rooms were very clean and tidy and included a toilet that was separate to the bathroom. All amenities were clean and well maintained. Included a safe to lock passports and travel documents away.The grounds of the hotel are secluded and tranquil, which is good after heading back to the hotel for peace and quiet.We included the buffet breakfast which we found to be very worthwhile and included a good range of food with good service.We found the staff at the hotel always pleasant and willing to speak english.The area the hotel is located in is very safe and includes a good variety of shops, cafes and other services. Two metro stops are at either end of the rue delambre and there is a good supermarket two doors up from the hotel. This is a great hotel for a family or people who like to feel they are in a safe area.I plan to use it again when travelling to paris

<Content>Small but well appointed rooms Don't choose this hotel if you need a large room to splash out in after a few hours of touristing. Our room was excellent for sleeping (clean, comfortable bed and no street noise), personal hygiene (clean and modern bathroom), and as base camp for touristing (friendly staff, breakfast buffet, good resturants and food shops right outside the hotel entrance). But it definitely wasn't big, with less than two feet of free space either side of the bed and perhaps three feet at the end. But weather permitting and if you don't need the privacy of your own room, the hotel has its own front court and garden where you can sit and relax. Location is excellent for Montparnasse (Tour Montparnasse, catacombs, Luxembourg garden), OK for things south of the Seine (e.g. Eiffel scaffold, Invalides, latin quarter, chinatown), but you will probably want to take the metro for e.g. the opera, Louvre, Montmartre and Defense. Of course there is a metro station close to the hotel as there is always a metro station close by in Paris.

<Content>Lively Location A very simple,comfortable hotel just a few minutes walk from a whole range of cafes, bars and restaurant not to mention an irresistable patisserie/chocolatier. A perfect place to base yourself for a stay in Paris. There is a Metro station just 5 minutes away. Lovely - would definitely recommend the hotel and the area.

<Content>A lovely place to spend a weekend! A lovely hotel based around a courtyard which is set back off a quiet side road. Our room (507) was basic, quiet and clean. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Would recommend you request a non-smoking room directly with the hotel if you specifically want one. Ample places to eat within easy walking distance and we were incredibly impressed with how accessible everything was from the hotel (two metro stops within 5 mins walk took us wherever we wanted to go). Air France bus from CDG Airport cost just 14 euros each way and the drop at Montparnasse main station is a 5-10 min walk from the hotel. We would definitely use this hotel again.

<Content>Great Location Great location, Air France bus took us from CDG Airport to Montparnasse for 12 euros each. Hotel was set back off street very quiet. Rooms basic but very clean and comfortable. Excellent selection of restaurants within easy walking distance. Near 3 metro stations Vavin, Edgar Quinet and Montparnasse. Travel to see any of the sights for 1.40 euros a day. Recommend The Batobus boat trip for economical viewing of all the major attractions, cost 11 euros each. Lots of nice bars, cost of drinks vary. we were 2 couples on a 4 day trip from Dumfries in Scotland.

<Content>An oasis in the middle of the City. The staff was very helpful with all my needs. The decor of the rooms is excellent. No noise from the city and access is very close to the subway entrance at Vavin. Also local store shopping including FNAC is very close by.The only negative experience is with the air conditioner. I stayed during the end of July 2006 when Paris as a whole was very hot and the air conditioner had a hard time keeping up...26-28C in the room. But the room and facilities were still top-notch. After staying a night in London and then coming here it felt as if I had found an oasis and at a very good price. The buffet breakfast was very nice as well. You don鈥檛 have to worry about where to eat before starting your adventures in Paris!

<Content>A well loved hotel I have visited over 20 times This is our favourite hotel in Paris because of its price, its very central location close to all the lovely brasseries La Coupole, La Rotonde, the wonderful Closerie des Lilas and it is just round the corner from Le Dome in the little side street off Boulevard Montparnasse. Also it is very close to both metro stations Vavin and Edgar Quinet which brings you directly to museums, sights and the Seine in minutes. The hotel is set back from the street level in a courtyard - is modern and welcoming. All areas are well designed and the rooms are lovely usually with a little hallway set back from the door, separate toilet, lovely bathroom and many of the rooms have a garden or courtyard view. Spacious and quiet with electric shutters which allow you to sleep in if necessary and very comfortable beds. The buffet breakfast is excellent and usually the deals through Cresta Holidays are very good for extra nights and often first class upgrades on Eurostar. There is a supermarket next door and a very large one further down the street which we only discovered on our visit in August. The staff are very welcoming. This is a 3 1/2 star hotel and for value, location and comfort we cannot recommend it too highly. I am glad to see it now on the Trip Advisor website.
