<Content>Foodies, this is your place to stay If you're a foodie and this hotel is within your budget, this is your place to stay. First, the basics:Location: A+ It's right next to one of the main train/subway stations Room: Large (for Japan), and with a viewNow for the food: It's right across from Krispy Kreme,where they give free samples (a whole donut!) if you can bear to wait in line which can be a 1 hr wait. Across from the hotel is Tajima Times Square ,this shopping mall that has many options of food on the top 2 floors. The best kobe place (Imahan), the best dumpling place (Din Tai Foong), basically the mall has a lot of upscale restaurants with a huge variety --Italian, French, Chinese, you-name-it. It's great when you've come back from touring Tokyo, and you don't want to go anywhere, but you still want to eat well -- well good food can be had right across the walkway.

<Content>Excellent hotel Just returned from Xmas in Tokyo .My wife and I have visted our son and his wife a few times. We have stayed in some good hotels but for convenience (re travel) this is definitely the best. Literally 3 minutes from Shinjuku station it is perfect for getting quickly to anywhere in Tokyo. We got the Narita Express from the airport and found getting to the hotel very easy.Make sure you exit at the correct exit from the station ( South Terrace Exit) as with it being such a huge station you can easily get disorientated.. A young mn on Flikr has done all the work for you so if you click on his link then he spells out exactly how to get to the hotel !http://www.flickr.com/photos/71736073@N00/221222443/The staff are friendly and very helpful. There was a good selection of food at breakfast ( when I asked for a fried egg a member of staff brought me one to the table !). We had dinner twice ( in Tribeks) and thought the meals were very good.Shop around for a good deal ( I booked with Asiarooms which was a lot cheaper than the other sites and breakfast was included). The cheapest flights were with Finnair.Will almost certainly stay at this hotel again when we visit next Xmas.

<Content>Hotel Century Sth Tower...Liked It Excellent position only a few minutes walk to Shinjuku Station. Although a little expensive it was worth it as a nice and comfortable way to finish up our 4 week Japan tour. The room was very comfortable and a good size with all expected amenities. The reception always had people who spoke excellent English and are very willing to help (but then again.. that's just the Japanese way). There is a great shopping complex (MASSIVE!) a few minutes walk away for the girls across the train line.Great views as the hotel starts at the 20 or 40 something floor.30min walk to Park Hyatt Hotel (from Lost in Translation). Definitely, definitely take the time to go here (for sunset) and have a drink or (if you got the cash) eat at the restaurant on the top floor. Even to just see the sunset over Mt Fuji is enough to make the effort worthy.As with all Japanese Hotels... make sure u ask for a Non-Smoking room as smoking is very prolific in Japan where people still smoke in restaurants and if your a non smoker or reformed smoker ........................ it can be very hard to cope!

<Content>Good location and room size for tokyo I usually stay in century southern in Tokyo, I find the location to be very convenient to restaurants and entertainment. The room is decently sized for Tokyo, and the bed is comfortable. only big problem with the hotel is coming in from the airport and taking the airport express, after you get out from the train station if you take the wrong exit it will be a long hike to find it. Also if you are not familiar with its location it will be hard to find as the main lobbies signs are not apparent at all.

<Content>Great location and good all round hotel When I checked in they said that there was no room service but that I could buy drinks to take to the room. Suits me fine as I never use room service anyway, and probably explains why the hotel was much better value than others in the Shinjuku area. The room was a good size, comfortable big bed, good bathroom and free internet. The tower is a few minutes walk from Shinjuku station with some of the best connections to the rest of the city. Hundreds of restaurants nearby and 3 restaurants within the hotel, although these are quite expensive. Check-in is on the 20th floor and rooms above that, so if you do not like heights in an earhquake zone, this is not for you. The views are stunning however. Service was first class. Overall, probably one the the most convenient hotels in the area, and for business or leisure you could do a lot worse than stay here.

<Content>Excellent location and service This establishment has an excellent location, close to Shinjuku station. It is above an office block (the lobby is on the 20th floor) and is very quiet. There is a free English language newspaper each morning. The standard of house keeping is excellent and the free Internet broadband works perfectly.There are lots of eating places nearby. I would choose this hotel again and would happily recommend it to others.

<Content>Great hotel in Tokyo! The Century Southern Tower is great. It is super-clean, the staff is really friendly and helpful and the location is absolutely excellent. The JR line is outside the hotel and so is the Toei line, but you will need to walk for 5 minutes (can do it in the Odakyu center!) if you only have a ticket for Tokyo metro. The room is a good size for Tokyo with a spectacular view. Breakfast has a large choice (although they could do better scrambled eggs..) and the food is fresh and of very good quality.It is also very quiet at all times.I think you will not be disappointed if you choose this hotel! It is not so expensive for what it has to offer.Room service is not available but who needs that in the very center of Tokyo??!!??

<Content>Nice hotel This is a very nice hotel, especially for business travelers. The hotel is located at the heart of Shibuya (wow, lots of good restaurants and shopping centers...however over-crowded). The hotel is located in a office building, lobby at 19/F. You will have to handle your luggages. Room was very clean (my room was in the 32/F), and breakfast buffet was great. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

<Content>I LOVE this hotel!! Basically, this hotel is awesome. It's not overexpensive by any means, even for Tokyo. I think I paid $179 per night for a room with one full size bed. The staff go out of their way to help. The hotel lobby, bar and restaurant have incredible views from the 20th floor. Your room will undoubtedly have an incredible view too. The location is perfect, its a one or two minute walk to the South exit of Shinjuku station which can take you anywhere you need to go. Takashimaya, Tokyu Hands, and Kinokuniya (has a large English section) bookstore are a foot bridge away. There are several other restaurants, coffee shops, and even a krispy Kreme donuts right around the building. The airport limousine bus drops you off at the door, so no need to worry about how to get to hotel. There is free internet access in the room. Let's see, what else? The breakfast buffet is really good, lots of selection. The rooms are a good size for Tokyo and definitely are updated. The lobby area looks fantastic. I really can't say enough about it! I love this hotel and probably won't stay anywhere else whenever I come to Tokyo.

<Content>Location is #1 Location is excellent! Right opposite to Takashimaya department store, the hotel is within 5 mins walk from Shinjuku JR/subway station and Lumine. Hotel staff were attentive and able to communicate in English for directions.The room was rather small but spacious enough to fit in two large luggage. What can you ask for more in a city like Tokyo? If you aren't looking much for facilities such as gym and swimming pool, this hotel is ideal for shopaholics and you can definitely do some last minute shopping before you leave.

<Content>Excellent location, Odd lack of service I stayed at the Century Southern Tower for four nights on a business trip.My room was on the 27th floor and had an amazing view of the city. The room itself was small (but pretty large for Tokyo) and had a fridge and a smallish TV. The bathroom was relatively small, but clean and modern, right down to the electric toilet seat.There are some surprising misses at the Southern Tower. To start with, there's no room service. There are several (pricey!) restaurants on the premises, as well as a convenience store right by the room elevators. There's a beverage vending machine on each floor, but no snacks. Also, there's a pants-pressing machine, but no iron or ironing board, and the staff wanted two days to press and return my shirts, so I wound up going to my meetings somewhat wrinkled.The breakfast buffet was mediocre and expensive. I did eat at the Chinese restaurant with a colleague (my meetings were in the office floors below the hotel) and I thought it was reasonably good. Not to worry, though, there's a Starbucks just about 100 feet from the entrance, as well as a Krispy Kreme (with a permanent and lengthy queue) for breakfast. A little further away, there's an excellent bakery near the New South Exit of the Shinjuku station.The location is great - only footsteps from the Shinjuku station (use the Southern TERRACE Exit, not the South Exit) and is right near great shopping - Takashimaya and Tokyu Hands are right across the tracks. There are also lots of great food choices in the vicinity.Overall, I enjoyed my stay, but I really wish they had irons in the room...

<Content>awesome! i stayed here for 2 weeks in may and had an amazing time. everything was pretty much perfect and the hotel has some AMAZING views, especially at night. probably the best hotel convenience/location-wise in tokyo, right opposite takashimaya square and a 2min walk from shinjuku eki (train station). has a kinkos on the bottom floor and a convenince store on the 20th (lobby). i didn't go to the bar at all so i can't comment. the only downsides i found was its really expensive (i paid $290 AUS a night but i'm sure you can find it cheaper) and the western/american restaurant (forgot the name) totally sucks.i can't say enough good things!

<Content>Loved the view Stayed from 9th-11th May for a weekend. It was raining unfortunately, the whole weekend, and could not see the much raved about view clearly from the windows. Service was good, location was convenient to the business traveler. It was also convenient to check from the window the queue status at Krispy Kreme to decide if I wanted to join the queue. The minus point was that it wasn't near to any convenient stores at all should you feel like a late night drink. The hotel does have its own minimart, but of course, selection is limited. I probably will stay here again on work.

<Content>excellent hotel, very convenient, good value Stayed there for a weekend as a first-timer in Tokyo with no knowledge of Japanese and found the hotel great and very convenient. First of all, the location can hardly be bet. The hotel is within easy walking distance of JR Shinjuku station as well as several subway stations. Navigation around the hotel to and from those stations is very easy. Proximity to JR Shinjuku means you have a direct train connection to Narita airport without having to change trains at Tokyo main-station, which is usually extremely crowded and difficult to navigate, especially with luggage. Also very close, there is Takashimaya, a huge department-store.Check-in and check-out were very efficient and reception was always very helpful when we had any questions. The hotel itself is rather new, our room was one of the bigger ones on the top floor (35th) with a great view of the city. The room was well-equipped, spacious and clean. We did not have breakfast at the hotel and tried Krispy Kreme doughnuts instead, following advice in previous reviews. I highly recommend the classic glazed doughnuts there. Also, there is Starbucks just a few steps away.All-in-all, a very positive experience. We payed around 25.000,- Yen per night for the superior room and found that very good value for what the hotel offers.

<Content>Hotel with a view Since the hotel starts around floor 26, so most rooms have great views. Our room faces the city side with great view of the downtown and shinjuku. It's very centrally located and JR train station is right downstairs. We were there on Christmas Eve. They had a band playing music during the night and also had a special Christmas dinner in their restaurant. However there were so many people on Christmas eve in Tokyo, and we were so overwelcomed that we really prefer Kyoto and other small towns around Tokyo. The hotel itself was difinitely worth staying.

<Content>Great Hotel in a great location. Century Southern HotelGreat Hotel in a great location.I've been to Tokyo 4 times for business and/or leisure and all 4 times I've stayed at this hotel for at least 1 day. This hotel is a fantastic hotel with fantastic service located in the heart of Shinjuku. The hotel is minutes walk from Shinjuku train station; and the views from the 20th floor lobby is absolutely breath taking.Location:To get to this hotel from Narita airport - take the Narita Express (do not take a taxi - a taxi will take almost 2 hrs and will cost close to $300 USD) to Shinjuku station. The Narita Express costs about $31 USD/person one way and is fast and efficient. It'll take about 1hr 25 minutes. Get off at Shinjuku station, get out at the Southern Terrace exit or South Main Exit. Look up and head for the tall white building - past the Starbucks and directly adjacent to the relatively new Krispy Kreme store. Take the elevator to the 20th floor lobby. The hotel is minutes walk to the Shinjuku business district and the electrifying retail night life. Major dept stores as well as numerous retail shops and restaurants are all within minutes walk. A citibank ATM can be found in the builing behind the hotel on the street level. Service:Overall service and the concierge is exceptional. Go to the restrooms in the lobby floor and get a great view of Shinjuku and the Takashimaya Dept store. This hotel has a gym and offers free in-room high speed internet free wi-fi access in the lobby area - bring a Cat5 cable with you or purchase one at the front desk. Hotel rates are reasonable for this class hotel (less than $200/night). I highly recommend this hotel for first timers to Tokyo.

<Content>Great location, rooms still good but start thinking renovation Summary: I have stayed at this hotel 5 or 6 times in the past 10 years. The location is fantastic and service is great, but prices have continuously gone up and perhaps the rooms are starting to date a bit.Location: As good as you can get at Shinjuku, 2 to 3 minutes from the JR Shinjuku's south and new south entrance. 5 minutes to Odakyu rail and Tokyo Metro subway lines. 5 minutes to Shinjuku-dori (neon lights), and just a couple more to Kabuki-cho. Directly across from Takashimaya Department Store, My Lord, Lumine, Tokyu Hands. Tons of restaurants around as well. Shop until you drop!Rooms: Single rooms are small but double rooms are of good size. The sound-proof door has hydraulic hinges so it is very quiet. Each room has a large window that gives you a decent view no matter what direction you are looking at. If possible, ask for the Takashimaya view as those are the best, followed by Mt. Fuji (usually not visible). Despite the age now (the rooms haven't changed in close to 10 years), it is very well maintained. However, the bathroom is starting to feel a little dated, and the TV is relatively small. TV does feature English news channels. Free newspaper (English if you are a foreigner) is delivered each morning.Food: I have eaten many buffet breakfasts at the now renovated Tribeks restaurant. The buffet has decent choices and is of good quality, a mix of Japanese and Western. They now feature an omelette/egg station as well. The breakfast is costly though if it's not included in your rate.Service: Always polite and helpful. Note that the hotel is a high class business hotel but not a true five star so it has no bell service. They do have luggage carts at the lobby level that are self-service. They hotel will also happily stow your luggage until your departure after check-out, or should you wish to take a day trip and come back.Value: Prices have climbed steadily over the years. With Keio Plaza recently renovated and Sunroute Plaza opening just next door, I think they need to start thinking about renovating their rooms to offer competitive value.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Wonderful Stay The hotel is a gem. The front desk staff is very friendly. Admittedly, I was spoiled by staff in smaller cities who automatically took our bags and showed us to and around the room. The hotel actually has luggage carts behind the front desk which is a little tacky. The rooms are updated, clean and spacious for Tokyo. Amenities are pretty good. Since the hotel starts at the 20th floor, everyone is guaranteed a view. You either look out at Mt. Fuji (when it's clear) or the Tokyo Tower. The hotel even provides a view map for the room. The location next to Shinjuku Station cannot be beat. Easy train access and great neighborhood with shopping, dining, sites and a huge park in walking distance.

<Content>Fantastic hotel We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on a stopover from London to Perth. The hotel was fantastic. The views were wonderful and the staff most helpfull. The hotel restaurant is pricey so it is recommended that you go out to eat. Krispy Kreme donut shop is located right next door to the hotel - watch the line it never ends!The staff were very helpful. It is useful to get the to write on a card for you 'Please take me to hotel century southern tower' it makes things a lot easier for you for taxis! Also this hotel is also a bus stop for the Bus Service direct to Narita airport so it makes life easier getting there and back.

<Content>Wow Tokyo We stayed in this hotel a few years ago. Great bustling location and they gave us a great room with fantastic views - we could even see the beautiful snow-capped Mount Fuji. This may sound trivial but the high-tech toilet was amazing - there were so many buttons. We stayed four nights during winter - it was cold but the sun was shining, the days were beautiful and the breathtaking million dollar view from our room was crystal clear.Tokyo is definitely one of the world's most fascinating and exciting cities. We had such a wonderful and unique holiday - we can't wait to return.

<Content>Good choice Had 3 days of meetings in Fuchu but didn't fancy staying there as it's a bit of a backwater. The Shunjuku area is fantastically connected to airport (70 mins on Narita Express direct) and Fuchu (20 mins on underground). The Century Southern Tower is a wonderful hotel within 2 mins walk of Shinjuku station. makes it great for business and pleasure in Tokyo. The room was small by European standards but seemed generous for Tokyo. Service and food were excellent. Couldn't recommend it more as a base for tourist or business trips. Very good value for money in what is usually a very expensive city.

<Content>Location, location, location For the best (affordable!) views of Tokyo, look nowhere else but this great value and well-appointed hotel on the 20-29th floors of a Shinjuku tower. We only stayed one night, en-route to Kyoto, but the view from our 27th floor room was breathtaking. All rooms come with a stunning view, but push the boat out a little further to get a room with as much space as you can afford - Tokyo hotel rooms are usually tiny. Our double room was 34m squared, which was perfectly ample and suited us perfectly. The bar and lobby have the best views - vertigo-inducing floor to ceiling glass on opposite sides give sunset views of Mount Fuji to the west and the centre/east of Tokyo city respectively.Pleasant and helpful staff, ubiquitous many-functioned japanese toilets and fantastic location made staying at this hotel a really fun and enjoyable experience. The only drawback was the long queue for the (expensive) breakfast in the morning - we skipped it and grabbed a bite and coffee at Starbucks just across the plaza.The Shinjuku location is great for that in-your-face, bright-lights, big city Tokyo experience. Shop till you drop at the countless department and electrical stores and wander down the quieter back streets for an amazing array of restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets.A huge bonus was the direct train service from the airport to Shinjuku station, so you only have to drag your luggage across the plaza and you're there in 1hr 15mins door to door. Direct tains run once an hour, but if you've just missed one, you can get one going to Tokyo station and change there. It adds about another 20 minutes to the journey. Don't try and get a cab from Tokyo station - you'll drain your cash in one very expensive trip. You can also get the hotel limousine bus from the airport, but it takes an age and is more expensive than the train!

<Content>what can I say! We caught the Shinkansen from Osaka to Tokyo. Got off at Shinjuku station and followed the south exits. The hotel was easy to find (shares the Microsoft building).We asked for and got an east facing room on Level 34. Magnificent views - possibly the best you'll get from a Tokyo hotel.The check in was seamless, the room facilities great (no mini-bar but who cares - there's a Lobby store on level 20 that sells everything you'll need). Free internet connection was really useful.The hotel was quiet and in a great position. We only ate at the hotel one night - great food and reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant.It really was a great choice and I'd recommend it to anyone.Nobody does service like Japan!

<Content>Oasis in the middle of the action Stayed for 4 nights in this great hotel, right next to one of the best places for going out in Tokyo.The hotel was excellently maintained, the view from the rooms is fantastic and the staff were all very helpful and spoke good English.Although there is no room service there is a fridge and a kettle in the rooms and a host of convience stores outside meaning that preparing breakfast and snacks is no problem.

<Content>Great hotel, in a great location This is a modern, stylish clean hotel, in a good part of central Tokyo (Shinjuku). It's very close to a major station, loads of night life, shops and attractions.We were happily based there for about a week. Luckily, we smiled nicely and they gave us a large corner room on the 32nd floor. The room had about 8 meters of windows, over looking an awesome city-scape. In the morning you could see the sunrise, in the day, the hives of activity - and the flashing lights and neon at night.Good service, helpful staff (all English speakers), handy convenience shop, nice bar, etc.Well recommended...

<Content>Century Southern Tower in Tokyo I was toying between Keio Plaza and Century Southern Tower and am really glad that we chose the latter. Although it is not a renown tourist hotel, most of CST's guests are either businessmen, or leisure travellers. You do not see tour groups or little children running everywhere, thus the hotel is well maintained and they are able to provide quality service. Even their breakfast is of good quality but don't expect a feast spread. The room is very clean, size very comfortable for a couple. A little tight for triple. The hotel location in Shinjuku is very very convenient. It is just 3 mins walk to the main station and bus terminal. Just across the hotel is Times Square Takashimaya, Krispy Kreme, and Starbuck. It is only a few minutes walk to the heart of Shinjuku which comes alive at night. The cost is higher than the average but worth every cent.

<Content>Perfect Hotel for our trip We stayed at the Century Southern Tower from 26/12/07 to 02/01/08 and cannot find fault with the hotel. We arrived 12 hours later than expected and were concerned that our room may have been taken but we were given a room on the top floor which we were very happy about. It was a smoking room but it did not small of smoke at all so was worth the risk. We had an amazing view and although it was cloudy we knew that if we got a clear day we would be able to see Mt Fuji. The room was very modern and clean and we were even provided with robes which were replaced with clean ones everyday. The bed was very big and there was enough room for us to live comfortably for 5 days. On the 3rd Day we got a view of Mt Fuji which was amazing and well worth being on that side of the hotel.The hotel reception staff were brilliant and helped every time we asked them a question. On the 2nd day my husband had a very bad cold and went to ask the reception to write down a phrase that he could take into a chemist 鈥?they went one step better and gave him some medication! The next day we needed to know what time the last train back from Roppongi was and they checked there and then online for us. On the last day we needed to know about the Narita express times and prices and they provided all this for us straight away. My only minor complaint is that the hotel bar closed quite early for us.We ate at the Japanese restaurant in the hotel as we were given some discount vouchers. It was expensive but if you don鈥檛 mind paying around 拢100 for a meal ( with wine) then I definitely recommend the Tepanyaki restaurant. You sit in a semi circle and have the food prepared right in front of you and are told about each dish by an English speaking chef. He advised us very well on what to order according to our tastes and the steak was amazing.Places I can recommend to eat include, The Chelsea caf茅 for sandwiches, the Indian restaurant within the Southern Tower complex, Arawan Thai restaurant in Roppongi. I thought I would struggle as I don鈥檛 eat fish but I ate amazing food everyday and a lot of places do have English menus if you look for them.If I ever went back to Tokyo, which I think I might, I would definitely stay at this hotel again 鈥?the location was perfect for what we wanted to do and there was always somewhere to go for a drink/eat/shopping and the staff could not be more helpful.

<Content>Clean, modern hotel in a great location We stayed at the Century Southern Tower as part of our honeymoon.One of the main reasons we chose the hotel is its location. From Narita airport, you can catch a train directly to Shinjuku, and you can actually see the hotel on your left as you come into the station (the building with the Microsoft sign). From the station, it's a few minutes flat walk to the hotel along the new 'Southern Terrace'. We had fairly heavy luggage and it wasn't difficult to get to the hotel.Reception was easy, and everyone we interacted with in the hotel spoke fluent English. The rooms are small, but were clean, had nice beds and good views of the surrounding area. As another reviewer said, the map describing what you can see out the window was a nice touch.We didn't eat in the hotel, because it looked very fancy and expensive. The rooms have a fridge and you are encouraged to buy your own food for breakfast. There is a small convenience store in the hotel, but we'd recommend visiting the basement level of the Takashimaya shopping centre, which is just across the railway. Just cross the concourse where you'll see everyone queueing up for Krispy Kreme donuts. At Takashimaya, you can buy breakfast groceries such as fruit and cereal, as well as prepared food for lunch and dinner (such as bento boxes, dumplings, cakes and sushi). There are also restaurants on the top levels.The hotel was a great base to explore the Shinjuku area, and to catch trains to other parts of Tokyo. Nearby are countless department stores, as well as interesting shops such as Tokyu Hands, Pachinko parlours and restaurants. If you're into shopping, this is the place to stay.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a great base from which to explore Tokyo and doesn't plan on spending a lot of time in their room and the hotel itself.

<Content>Great location. We arrived at the hotel via Narita Express that stops at Shinjuku station and easily found our way to the hotel with luggage in toe. There were signs everywhere and you can download the map from the hotel website. We had a room on the 33rd floor with fabulous views over the city. It was spacious and well equipped. Big plus was the internet access that we did not have to pay extra for!! The lack of room service was a plus as it forced us to go out for dinner. Just downstairs in the building and across the road in the Times Square building (12-14th floors) there are many restaurants to choose from but be prepared to use hand gestures and point at the wax food samples in the window. And go early to dinner otherwise you will have to line up (sit ) and wait. The location was great with shops and restaurants close by, Starbucks and Krispy Cremes just outside and McDonalds only a 5mins walk away and the station only a 3min walk. But beware you are on the JR line not the subway line. This is an efficient service and certainly takes you to most of the tourist spots but the subway is faster. The subway lines are located on the street level side of the hotel not the promenade level. The ticket machines do have an English button but basically you have to know how much your ticket will cost - research this on the internet, it will also tell you what trains to catch and at what time. The hotel staff were friendly and attentive.

<Content>Perfect hotel if you want to be in the middle what Tokyo is about First, the location is unbeatable. Steps from Shinjuku station, many huge department stores, fabulous restaurants and food halls. Views, especially from east facing rooms, are unbelievable. The rooms are the perfection of a cookie cutter hotel room design. They're not particulary stylish, but they're immaculate, everything is where it should be, and they have good bathrooms, great beds and nice linens. I like having an empty fridge instead of a mini-bar, and I wouldn't think of room service with so many food options steps from the hotel. The public areas are very classy, and the front desk staff is fantastic. Great rates.

<Author>Foreigner_in_London
<Content>Nice hotel in a good location I have stayed at this hotel many times over the last couple of years, and I keep coming back. It's not a *great* hotel, but I'd say it's above average (just), so would give this a 3 1/2 if there were such an option. There is a large, relatively modern lobby, with the staff in the reception being understately welcoming in a typically Japanese manner. They don't seem to have any particular upgrading or welcoming system for returning guest. I've been there more than 10 times, but only once did they say 'welcome back'. It would be nice if they might have recognised the fact we've been there so many times.I'd say this hotel is more suitable for business travel than for holiday makers, as they only have a limited capacity for what to suggest in terms of entertainment and tourist attractions, but they will go out of their way to help you the best they can with any enquiries. When I asked about climbing Mt Fuji (out of season), one of the receptionists spent almost an hour trying to help me. For the record, I wouldn't recommend anyone without a car doing a night climb of Fuji out of season.The rooms have the basic facilities, are of adequate sizing, and the beds are comfortable enough though I wouldn't make a song and dance about any of it. Sometimes you get a great view of either of the nearby parks and/or the city lights and skyscrapers. Most of the rooms are also quite quiet, which is nice when you're tired. You have to pay extra for an internet cable, but I bought one on the first stay and always bring it back on subsequent stays.There is a very small gym, with mainly cardiovascular equipment, that tends to be quiet most of the time, which is nice for a private basic gym session. There are many restaurants in and near the hotel, although personally I don't rate the actual hotel restaurants that highly, but prefer the restaurants on the ground and the first floors, and others nearby. I would primarily recommend this hotel to business travellers, as it's not really suited to holiday makers, and they wouldn't really fit in there. If you are mixing business with one part holiday, this is the ideal hotel though, with its proximity to a very well-connected station and its understated and classy service. I think that as a holiday maker, you'd feel rather uncatered for, but if this doesn't bother you, then it might be suitable for you too.I do really like this hotel and the area because I've been there so many times, and I know them pretty well now. When I first visited Tokyo, I stayed in 5 different hotels (my lovely husband booked us in to 5 different hotels so I would get to experience different parts of town), and Century Southern Tower was marginally my favourite overall in terms of location and the hotel itself.

<Content>Excellent Hotel in Tokyo I'm not the first to say that hotels in Tokyo are overpriced, but the Century Southern Tower is an excellent value for the money. It's at the top of a skyscraper near Shinjuku station, so all rooms have excellent views. The hotel is fairly convenient to Shinjuku station, but I have to warn that it's a bit confusing to find for first-timers. Be sure to have a good map.Rooms are spacious by Tokyo standards, didn't feel cramped at all. Reception was friendly and spoke good English. Breakfast is served in one of the restaurants at the Lobby level (very nice views also). A word of warning, don't try to go to breakfast in the last hour or so - you'll have a long wait.As mentioned, the only drawback of the hotel is that there is not room service. There are, however, plenty of restaurants in the Shinjuku area, including many restaurants where you pre-pay your meal via ticket from a vending machine out front. This hotel is popular and can sell out. If the website says it's booked, it's still worth calling the hotel to see if anything's available

<Content>To quote Arnie, "I'll (We'll) be back!" Hubby and I went to Hokkaido on a 7day holiday, and extended our Japan sojourn by another 3 days in Tokyo. We picked this hotel for our Tokyo extension thanks to the many glowing reviews on this site.The hotel truly did not disappoint - it's a very good four star hotel. Our room was decently sized and the bed was comfy. Service generally in Japan is good, but at this hotel, just about everyone manning the front desk speaks decent English, which made things so much easier for two clueless gaijins! On the not so good side however, the much vaunted Mt Fuji view wasn't really visible, in part because it was cloudy most of the time we were there, and also because there's another behemoth being constructed some blocks away whose crane was obscuring our view. Also, although we were on the 32nd floor, it was still possible to hear the (slight) rumblings of passing trains, especially in the very early morning.Oh and although the hotel is located, very conveniently, on top of the very busy Shinjuku station, for first time visitors to Tokyo, please note that there are a number of stations in the area with Shinjuku in their names, and also a lot of exits which can get very confusing. Lastly, we loved the Krispy Kremes outlet right at the foot of the hotel, especially since the Krispy Kreme franchise isn't available in Singapore as yet. We'd peek out to see if there was any queue (and believe me, the queue snaked about 50 to 80 ppl at the worst) and then scoot downstairs to get some hot doughnuts when the queue was minimal.We would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Tokyo!

<Content>Excellent Location, best hotel views! I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights en route from Australia to the UK in June.I chose this hotel mainly due to tripadvisor reviews and am thankful I did.I was travelling with my 10 year old son and arrived in Tokyo after 8pm - we found the hotel very easy to find despite our exhaustion from travelling for 13 hours- direct from the airport on the Narita Express to Shinjuku - takes just over an hour, and then 5 mins walk from the Station. Look at the hotel website for directions from the station as it can be confusing which exit to take!The hotel starts at the 20th floor of the Microsoft building - we were overawed by the view as we checked in ( even more so by the Loo with a View restrooms next to check-in!!) My son took photos!!Our room was a twin - very clean, with great shower, toiletries, razors etc provided, and a toilet with so many buttons and functions, that again my son got out his camera. Every room will have a great view and was exceptionally quiet.There was only GREEN tea making facilities in the room ( no coffee!) but luckily just outside the hotel is a Starbucks with Krispy Kreme next door ( be prepared for a 30 min wait in a queue for donuts!!). There is also a barfridge you can store supplies if needed. A great little convenience store is near reception and opens till 11pm.I used the Fitness Room each morning - treadmills and stairmaster, but no weights.As we really only were in the hotel to sleep I found it more than adequate for our needs and we got a great deal through the hotel website - 30% cheaper than my travel agent quoted me!I would highly recommend this hotel to all my friends as it is so convenient and has all the comforts I personally required for a pleasant stay.I am happy to answer any questions if needed.

<Content>Great Hotel! I travelled to Bangkok, Tokyo and Hong Kong with my two teenage daughters from the middle of June for 3 weeks. I have been to Tokyo a couple of times in my single days but this was the first time for my daughters. We picked this hotel for its excellent location.This is not a 5-star hotel. However, the room was extremely clean and had everything you need. I found the rates very reasonable. The all in one front desk staff were always helpful. I asked them to find me a good restaurant for Kobe steak and we were not disappointed at all. The breakfast was O.K. as compared with other first class hotels (especially after Bangkok). However if compared with North American standard it was exceptional.All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much. We will definitely book this hotel again and highly recommend it to friends.

<Content>Excellent view, service, and location First, the location of this hotel cannot be better. It's right next to the South exit of the Shinjuku station (but there's no train noise at all). The Narita Express entrance could be found easily. I walked to the Narita Express platform from the hotel while carrying two suitcases without any problem and I by-passed the crowd in the main concourse of the massive Shinjuku station. Second, the view in my room was breathtaking. I had a view of Mt. Fuji! All rooms are on high floors and thus all guests are guaranteed a good view. I guess rooms facing the other side of the building have a view of the Tokyo tower. BTW, even the lobby offers a nice view, esp. at sunset and at night. The lobby lounge offers a similar, if not the same, view as the Lost in Translation lounge at the Park Hyatt nearby.Third, the service was excellent. This hotel is officially a 4-star hotel, but I feel their service beats that of many 5-star hotels in different countries. The concierge staff got out of the way to help me locate places to visit. There's no bell service (the hotel calls itself a non-full service hotel) but this was not a problem to me.

<Content>Great in every way I agree with the other reviews. I stayed here for 3 days at the end of may and it was great. The staff were attentive but not over the top like you sometimes get in Japanese hotels. The lifts were fast and efficient which is important when the hotel starts on the 20th floor. The room was very big by japanese standards and very clean with a great shower etc. Because of the location it does not matter which room you stay in, you will get great view of Tokyo, Shinjuku or Mt Fuji. My only slight moan is that the windows dont open so you have no way of knowing what the weather is like when deciding what to wear and its 2 lifts and at least 21 floors before you can find out. By that time its too late to be bothered to go back up and change! This is true of many Japanese hotels though. Location is the best in Shinjuku, Better than the Park Hyatt and Keio Plaza. I prefered this hotel to the Park in Shiodome which is currently ranked 2 in the ratings.

<Content>Luxurious high rise in a great location This is a high rise hotel that occupies the 20th to 37th floors of a tall building just south of Shinjuku station. In the evenings there are throngs of prosperous Japanese strolling in the area between the hotel and the station. There are several specialty shops along the walk that have products from different prefectures of Japan, including one featuring things from Hiroshima. A bridge across the railroad tracks leads to two large department stores and a large bookstore. You can watch the Japanese lining up for Krispy Kreme donuts outside the hotel. The rooms are spotlessly clean and well appointed. Very complete set of amenities, including tooth brush, shaving and grooming kits, soap and shampoo. A few English channels on the TV. The gym, on the 21st floor, has only three cardio machines and no free weights or weight machine. Breakfast was included in our room price and was a very extensive buffet with attentive service. The hotel also has a Japanese and a Chinese restaurant, as well as a Mexican restaurant on the ground floor. Staff is very attentive and their English is very good. Excellent views from the guest rooms and the restaurant, looking over parks to the city beyond. It is fun to sit at breakfast and count the trains that come in to Shinjuku on 16 lines! Airport bus service to Haneda and Narita stops at the door.

<Content>Good Hotel Great hotel with good views and good location. It's a tad bit expensive, but a great splurge hotel. After your first night, they charge 500 yen to use their nightgowns, which I thought was especially stingy given how much we payed for the room.

<Content>Great hotel in Shinjuku This is a wonderful hotel right near Shinjuku train station. I think this is the best hotel in the Shinjuku area. Book early because this hotel does sell out.A cab ride from the train station will cost roughly 1600yen. Make sure you come with a map because for some reason cab drivers either don't know where this hotel is, or cannot understand it when Americans pronounce Century Southern. Not sure... but a map makes it a no brainer.Rooms here have a wall of windows. The views from the higher floors are fantastic. The rooms are nicely sized with a very nice bathroom.Service is very good with most employees able to speak English.The hotel has several restaurants in the building, and is located within walking distance of the major shopping areas. Very nice location.I think the only better hotel in Tokyo is the Westin Tokyo!

<Content>Absolutely wonderful A beautifully maintained and expertly staffed hotel in the heart of bustling Shinjuku. The hotel is a very short walk away from multiple major department stores as well as Shinjuku station. We were lucky enough to get a room on the top floor, and had fantastic views over the city. The room itself was very well maintained, spotlessly clean, and I really appreciated the attention to details such as personal slippers, nightshirt, automatic tea-maker and tea as well as many handy bathroom extras. The staff were unfailingly polite and helpful, and our stay could not have been more comfortable. The hotel bar, though we did not go there, has amazing views and you can see Mt.Fuji on a clear day. I highly recommend this hotel, as the location, staff, and amenities make it a fantastic place to stay.

<Content>Good Value in Great Location This hotel is located just a short walk from the rail station. Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. All of the rooms have a great view, as the hotel starts from the 20th floor of an office building and goes up from there. We used the spacious and comfortable coffee shop to hold two days of meetings. The Japanese restaurant was excellent. Rooms are not huge, but were adequate as Japanese hotels go. Not cheap either, but for Japan I would say it was mid-range, so it was good value for money.

<Content>Fabulous location! Located opposite the Shinjuku station and major department stores, it would be difficult to find a better location in Tokyo. As the rooms start from the 21st floor, there is no noise from the station and there are great views of the city and of Shinjuku-gyoen park.The rooms are relatively large, and are very clean with modern fittings. There is a proper tiled bathroom with bidet and the standard assortment of toiletries. A baby鈥檚 cot was provided at no charge.The Hotel doesn鈥檛 offer room service. We didn鈥檛 try any of the Hotel鈥檚 four restaurants as there were so many good, cheap options nearby. For example, the Takashimaya Times Square building opposite the Hotel has nearly 30 restaurants on floors 12-14 and, for takeaway, a great food court and gourmet supermarket in the basement. For coffee addicts, there is a Starbucks just outside the Hotel.The Hotel has a shop selling a small range of drinks, food, toiletries and other essentials such as umbrellas. There is also a fitness area with fabulous views from the exercise bikes, treadmills etc The staff were friendly, helpful and spoke adequate English. I highly recommend this Hotel.

<Content>I Have Found My New Tokyo Hotel! The many times I have visited Tokyo, I always stayed at a four-star property. I was hesitant to change hotels my last trip, but I am so happy I did. The Hotel Century Southern Tower is absolutely FANTASTIC! I can't wait to go back in 3 months and stay there again.LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. Absolutely wonderful restaurants (albeit a little pricey, as all nice Japan hotel restaurants are).I can't say enough good things about the Hotel Century Southern Tower (even though it was obviously built on top of a Microsoft building). If you can get reservations there, stay there!

<Content>Recommended Booked this hotel through [-------------]- quite a bargain rate - USD 155 per night for a double.We stayed a total of six nights over two weeks, left out luggage there for a few days as we took a trip out to Takayama in the Japanese Alps.We love the Tokyo city view outside the windows, we were fortunate to be given rooms at very high floors.The Shinjuku location is unbeatable, as we had a Japan Rail Pass, and used the train extensively, until the very last day, where we took the Narita Express to the airport. However, we did pre-Taykyubin our heavy luggage to Narita first.The hotel arranged for the services without any problems. The hotel's proximity to Takashimaya/Tokyu Hands was great - we did spend a rainy afternoon there. And the food floors at Takashimaya was just unbelievable.We didnt try any of the Hotel's restaurants, but they did give us generous discount vouchers to use upon check in.However, the Italian place on Southern Terrace is quite good, and we would recommend it.Overall, we would definitely go back to this hotel again.
