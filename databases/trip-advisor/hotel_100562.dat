<Content>Nice Hotel, Central Location My family and I stayed here during what will be remembered as one of the worst winters Seattle has seen in recent memory. Fortunately, the Sheraton is a few blocks away from great shopping and walking through the snow wasn't bad at all. In fact, we had to walk to all of our destinations because the Taxi's and Public Transportation system were not running at full capacity. We even walked to Pike's Place and the Aquarium one day and the Seattle Center another (yeah, the monorail was down also!). Still quite bearable from the Sheraton and my son thought running through all the snow was a blast.A few interesting things I noticed, lots of people smoking, and it didn't seem that most folks walking around were very friendly or courteous at all. I got the feeling that if I didn't get out of someone's way they'd walk into me. Maybe I just thought Seattle would be a little friendlier given the great reputation they have as being such a liveable place.The room was nice and comfortable. About what you'd expect from a four star hotel. Service was okay but not quite the same as a Grand Hyatt or similar. From what I understand we stayed in the newer renovated tower which is supposed to be much nicer than the other, older tower. We were nearly at the top so views, while not spectacular, weren't bad since you see above most everything other building. I'd suggest staying away from the in hotel restaurant. Quite expensive and service was mediocre. Just across the street is a ChesseCake Factory which is a much better deal for nearly the same quality of food. Only problem is that the Factory doesn't open for breakfast. My suggestion would be to have a donut and coffee for breakfast, you're in Seattle after all! There really aren't too many simple places to eat in the near vicinity unless you go to the food courts in one of the shopping centers nearby. The ones we went to seemed to be quite upscale so even the food court can be a bit pricey given the type of food served. All in all a pleasant stay.

<Content>Large room with small bed We originally planned to stay here before Christmas for some family time since we live in the Seattle area but due to the snow and the poor job of keeping the streets clear by the city (Mayor) we changed our reservation for the weekend after Christmas. We had a special Macy's rate and the hotel was gracious enough to change our reservation and we were able to keep the same rate which included a Macy's gift card of $100. We had a corner king room on the 19th floor in the new Union Street tower. The room was very large with a great view of the city and the water but be forewarned the corner king room does not have a king bed but a queen bed! My husband and I thought the bed (Sheraton Sweet Sleeper) was too hard and each of us woke up with back aches. We have a memory foam bed with a memory foam topper at home for comparison purposes. I was surprised the bathroom was a compact tub/shower combo with a single vanity sink. I expected a separate tub and shower for this size of room especially since this tower was recently built. They had a 32 flat screen LCD TV which was nice however the room is so large it really needs a larger TV. We couldn't read the guide on the the TV because it was so far away from the bed. I loved all the space in this room. There was a large desk area and an over sized chair with an ottoman. there was a large dressing area near the entrance to the room and still lots of room to move around. We had drinks in the lobby bar which was nice but did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants. Cheesecake factory (very good) and Palominos (very bad) were right near the hotel so we ate there. The hotel did not seem very busy so I was surprised there were dishes left out in the hallway for 2 days just down the hall from us. Not a pretty sight on your way out to eat. I would stay in this hotel again in this category of room if we could get a couple of mattress toppers to soften the bed. We had a very enjoyable time in the city and the Sheraton has a great location to shopping and dining and many other things our great city offers.

<Content>Great time at the Sheraton Upgraded to the concierge floor for $30 and it was well worth it. The hot and cold appetizers and free beverages were excellent quality at both dinner time and breakfast and the view is excellent. The fresh fruits were top quality and well presented. Oddly, or coincidentally, we agree with the previous reviewer about the sheets. They're way too starchy. We had no problems with housekeeping, but always, always use the Do Not Disturb sign. It's a hotel, and people come and go at all hours and the housekeeping staff has to do their jobs at all hours too. We had an excellent stay, and would recommend the Sheraton.

<Content>Be sure to put out your do not disturb sign - waitstaff can barge in uninvited My wife and I stayed here on Dec 27th 2008, taking advantage of their Macy's shop and stay package $199/night rate that came with the Macy's $100 gift card. The pros: they upgraded our room to a reasonably high floor, quiet corner room. The room was clean and the sheets were clean. The bed was comfortable. The waitstaff was very friendly.The cons: The sheets were extremely noisy - I roll over often in the night and every time I moved I woke my wife up - I even woke myself up a few times. The worst thing though was the wait-staff attempting to barge into the room at 9:30am on Sunday morning (we had the door lock across, so they did not actually get in). My wife was getting dressed. They said they knocked, but my wife was near the door and did not hear any knock - it really upset and shook her up. The knock however to me that doesn't matter. We like to sleep in - we could have been asleep and they would have walked in and woke us up. No way should anyone be entering any occupied room at 9:30am on a Sunday. Just really poor policy. I really got upset with the manager, and to his credit, he tried to make good - he gave us the parking for free and said he would add another 2500 starpoints to my starwood card. I am not so sure I would stay here again - but I think that if I were to again, I would be sure to put the do not disturb sign outside my door and let the front desk know to keep the waitstaff out until checkout.

<Content>Very Good But . . . Very good convention hotel with nice lobby and newer Union Tower in great location by tourist area and convention center. Room was particularly good for a Sheraton. Gym and pool are nice. But there is an annoying issue that gets in the way of really enjoying this hotel--they overcharge for the basic necessities of business travel. Examples are $38 per night for fairly slow valet parking (front desk has an it's a separate company shrug), $10 per day for internet, $5 per day to use the gym. At comparable downtown Seattle hotels at which I have also stayed, parking is under $30 per night and the internet and gym are included in the room price.

<Content>Great location!!! Stayed at the Seattle Sheraton for 6 nights for a work-related conference and to visit family in the Seattle area. Loved the central location just 5 blocks from Pike's Market and the original Starbucks and 3 blocks from a main city bus depot. The room was large and very clean, good quality linens. Lobby was a nice place to wait for colleagues and catch up on email with 6 computers available to guests. Great hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel in a very nice part of Seattle My wife and i were in town for a get away and to attend a Seahawks game. Shopping is everwhere around the hotel. The market is within walking distance. The room was in great condition and was very clean. I would recommend using the airport shuttle if you are not renting a car because it is quite pricy for a cab ride.

<Content>Convention Central I planned an anniversary getaway that started off on the wrong foot and improved from there. As I usually do for our annual get-away I stopped by the hotel early in the day of our check-in to drop off gifts for my bride. I went to the concierge desk with three gift wrapped boxes to be placed in our room prior to check-in. The concierge sternly informed me that they did not handle such arrangements and that I needed to talk to the bell desk. I wandered over there to be greeted (perhaps grunted would be a more apt description) by two men who clearly were not happy to be there. I placed my gifts on their counter and requested that they be placed in my room prior to our arrival as a surprise for my wife. They indifferently assured me that they would take care of it.Well, you guessed it. When we got to our room, the gifts were not there. Fortunately, a new bellman (Omer) had come on duty and when I explained what had happened he promptly took me to the room where they securely store items to find the gifts. Of course they were sitting there - the chocolate covered strawberries placed upside down. I told Omer that we were leaving for dinner at 6 and he could place the items in the room after we left. Omer came through big-time with not only my gifts but multiple gifts from the hotel in the form of apology.The Seattle Sheraton is one of the largest hotels in downtown Seattle having recently added another tower full of rooms. It is also adjacent to the Washington State Convention Center. Lots of convention goers stay there. Our weekend was no exception; hundreds of lawyers in town for a conference at the Sheraton. It made entering and exiting the hotel quite a lengthy and challenging process. Parking is valet only at $33 per day.The Sheraton does not have any fine dining but the Daily Grill is a fine diner. The pool and fitness center are quite nice, located on the top floor with lots of equipment and great views.Overall the Sheraton is a nice hotel but it is far from the nicest in Seattle.

<Content>Excellent Accomodations...but messed up my bill at checkout Stayed here for 2 nights. The rooms and the lobby were very nice  upscale. Rooms  bathrooms seemed to have been updated.During check-in there was a long line (with only 2 front desk clerks), and during check-out I was somehow double-billed. I had to wait for the manager to come out and clear the charges.Pros: -Accommodations are excellent (you basically get what you pay for)-Walking distance to shops, bars, restaurantsCons:-understaffed at check-in (took forever!)-incorrectly billed at check-out (although this was fixed after about 20 minutes)

<Content>Annoying charges at the Sheraton Got a great price at an excellent downtown hotel. Checking in was fast and the room was extremely well-appointed. They have a TWO-level gym on the 35th floor with astounding city views. The gym is far superior to any hotel gym I've seen with twenty aerobic machines and many free weights and benches. I got in two workouts during my overnight stay.Now for the annoying news. In this day of free hotel WI-FI, the Sheraton charges guests $9.95 per day for a hard-wired network connection. Business travelers expect free Internet these days; however, I was able to justify it because of the low room price I got, The real kicker, though, was the $10.00 handling fee they charged me for receiving a UPS shipment. That, in my opinion, was way out of line.

<Content>The best location We stayed for 2 nights after getting a bargain price through Priceline. We checked in pretty early but the reception staff were very helpful. The room was very spacious but we were in one which could have done with a bit of modernising - was perfectly clean and comfortable though! Limited free internet in the lobby, very popular with tour groups and conveniently on the Airporter bus route. Best thing of all about this hotel is the location - 4mins walk from Pike Place, and right in the heart of the shopping area! Fantastic!

<Content>Comfortable Stay I took a weekend trip with my infant son and mother to Seattle and enjoyed the central location of the Sheraton for shopping and fine dining. Our request for a room on a high floor was taken care of, as was the availability of a crib. The lobby is beautiful with modern furniture and lighting, along with many beautiful orange flowers. The hotel bar was cozy and comfortable for an evening drink on the sofa or a variety of other seating configurations. We walked to the malls, major department stores, Pike Place Market, and Pioneer Square. The bedding is very comfortable, the bathroom was redone in all modern materials, and the artwork was pleasing. We even got a paper delivered on Sunday morning.

<Content>Big Improvements It had been 2 years since we stayed at the Sheraton Seattle as there has been so much construction going on we didn't like it much last time we were there. We just went to Seattle for the weekend in Sept and WOW! It was beautiful. The lobby was great and the rooms were totally improved with flat screen TV's and new carpet. We have been staying at the W Seattle but have booked the Sheraton again for our next Trip to Seattle. I recommend you give it a try.We used www.sneakysunday.com to find great palces to eat. We found ZOE in Belltown ,what fantastic food and service. You must go! Thank you sneakysunday for showing us the best places to eat and drink.

<Content>Nice Eye Candy, but leaves a bad taste The Good: The Sheraton has a great location. The lobby is nice and large with plenty of tables and comfy chairs/sofa . Some coffee tables are interactive w/ mapping software and music. Fun for the kids to play with. The Daily Grill kwiki store in the lobby makes an OK coffee and provides some reasonably healthy breakfasts options at an OK price (eg granola yougurt parfait for $4.50). The elevators were very available and fast for our four day stay, considering we were on the 23rd floor. Big flat screen TV in the room was OK if your into TV.The Bad: The front desk originally gave us a 1 bed room when we ordered a two-bed room (this with 2 adults and 2 kids standing in front of the desk clerk). After getting our two bed room we later find that its pretty dirty. You could write your name in the dust on the lamps in the bathroom (probably the short maids can't reach that high). The carpet could use a good cleaning, if not replacing. The beds were very uncomfortable compared to most 4 star hotels I've been in. No pulbic trash cans in the ice rooms for getting rid of extra trash from the rooms. My wife tried eating a candy bar from the overpriced room stack basket only to read the label and see the expiration date was for March of 2008. Bleahh...The Interesting: The workout room is beautiful on the top floor. Unfortunately the pool was closed waiting for city permits. It really sucked having no pool, especially since we had two kids with us. I didn't use room service so I can't comment on the food.

<Content>I always like Sheratons I am always never disappointed with Sheratons, and liked this one also. The price is good, the rooms are large. For a little extra we got the club room feature which gives you free internet and breakfast (and happy hour too I think). We did hear a baby crying and my sisters in another room had an enthusiastic couple in the next room (ahem - not us!). But overall we had a great room, easy check in and out, nice towels and bedding, and friendly service.

<Content>Bad Impression and I haven't Even Made it Past the Lobby!! I booked a room here for a conference. I should have known that this stay would be a disaster when they told me they would have to move me from one room to another mid-stay. In order to avoid this, I am now paying extra for my room above the printed conference rate. Well, as I write this review, I am sitting in the hotel lobby. I have been here for about two hours because my room is not ready. Granted, check-in time is supposed to be at 3:00 and I did arrive early at 1:30. However, it is now 3:00 and I have just been told that I need to wait another hour. Apparently, in this entire hotel, there is not room ready for a guest?? No effort at all from the front desk except housekeeping is working as fast as they can. They did not have a perky response when I noted that other people are being checked into their rooms. I know because I have been here for 2 hours watching! I have not even seen the room and I already dislike this place. I will not be returning and I will also suggest that my colleagues stay elsewhere when they attend conferences or vacation in Seattle.

<Content>Fantastic I stayed here for a few nights on business and was fully expecting a non-descript city hotel: beige walls, stained carpeting, etc. Instead, the lobby is expansive with a long marble check-in counter and a comfy seating area that has several Microsoft Surface tables. Check in was smooth and my room in the Union Street tower was beautiful. I think I may have been in a newly renovated room, because everything was immaculate. Flat screen TV, spotless carpeting, warm colors on the walls and bed linens, big work desk, and a bathroom that had updated hardware. Very plush and comfortable. Room comes stocked with a new coffee maker and Starbucks coffee, Bliss toiletries, and daily newspaper delivery. Room service that was ordered at 7:30 pm arrived less than 30 minutes after I hung up the phone (and was pretty decent!). The gym was just renovated and has a decent selection of cardio equipment and weight machines. The pool was still closed but days away from opening. Concierge service was friendly and efficient, providing me with restaurant recommendations and a vase for the flowers I had bought at Pike Market.The hotel is perfectly situated. I can't think of anything negative to raise. I would definitely return to this hotel, even on a personal trip!

<Content>Exceptionally Convenient We booked a night at the Seattle Sheraton based on the reviews given by fellow travellers at Trip Advisor and we were definately not disappointed. Immediately upon arrival we were impressed with how easy the hotel was to find and to access. The valet service was very fast and we were checking into our room within minutes of arriving at the hotel. Our one and only complaint is very minor. The lady who checked us in was not having a very good day, I guess. She was very unfriendly and you could tell she was just there to do a job. But, that's okay, I've worked in the service industry before and we all have our bad days. The lobby was stunning, the room was spotless and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in (and I was nearly 9 months pregnant on this trip so that says alot!) We were a very short walk away from great restaurants and great shopping.Overall, I would definately stay here again and would recommend it to our friends and family for future trips to Seattle!

<Content>Great location but parking is expensive Loved the location, modern (clean) comfort, amenities, staff service and value (got it for $140 through hotwire). We would definitely stay here again and recommend to our friends.It's located right in the retail core and 6 blocks to Pike Place market (about 5 minutes) - definite must see! All major chain stores, restaurants, and movie theatres are at your doorstep. Wireless internet and flatscreen LCD in every room, computer terminals (free for hotel guests) are locared right in the lobby, and a new fitness centre just opened.Parking is expensive ($38 per day), but the valet jockey did suggest an alternative self-park lot nearby for $10 less. It was raining and we were tired, so we used the hotel valet. If you can, don't drive - there's a shuttle from the airport for $11 each way.

<Content>Great Hotel and Great Location! We stayed here in August as part of a round the world trip. The hotel is in a great central location and our tour to the Boeing factory left from the lobby. The hotel also has a little shop with souveniers as well as necessities (food and toiletries).Our check in was fast and easy. Our room was very spacious with a mini bar (however it was locked unless you asked for the key) and it was very clean. There was also an iron and ironing board, hair dryer and Starbucks coffee available in the room. Housekeeping will make the beds every day but won't change the linen unless you place a card on the bed. There is free internet available in the lobby, or you can get it in your room for approx $10 for 24 hours. The only minor thing is that the rooms are close together and the doors are noisy when people come and go. However, we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Perfect hotel Had a great stay at the Sheraton. Managed to secure a good rate through my Company and was allocated a room on the top floor of the Union Tower. The room was excellent - modern fittings, clean and practical. The bed was especially comfortable.Thje hotel has free wi-fi in the lobby and a good bar, with friendly staff. THere is also a good restaurant, which we ate in twice. The food was of a good standard.Location-wise, the Sheraton is hard to beat. About a 5-10 minute walk to Pike Place Market and the waterfront. I would recommend jumping on a ferry to Bainbridge - at about $7 each it's a lovely journey across even if you don't do anything once you get there!

<Content>Pretty bad, but what do you expect from a Sheraton Stay dates: Sept 28 - Oct 1 2008It was a friendly reception by the valet service people when I drove my rental car into the circular driveway, but that's when the pleasantness ended. Inside the hotel, I found the receptionist to be hostile -- certainly unwelcoming -- and when she learned that I had pre-paid my room through Priceline at a discount, that pretty much ended any hint of professionalism that she might have had.I think I got the smallest, grossest room in the hotel, I am absolutely sure of it. The carpet was nothing but one huge wine stain. The view looked directly into an office in the building next door. The bathroom had PLASTIC CUPS and a cheesy old 70s style shower curtain. The room was tiny.I returned to the reception desk to see if I could switch rooms, but all of the employees there looked grim and unfriendly, so I decided against it. One thing I did conclude though: I will NEVER stay at that dump again. NEVER. You can do a LOT better in Seattle for your $200.

<Content>Superb location and amenities Got this superb hotel for $90 on priceline. I was very impressed by the usual 4star nature of Sheraton - the comfortable bedding, contemporary bathroom fittings and amenities etc. A super extra at this site is the free internet access - 5 computer terminals in the lobby. Note the Union Tower is new. The pool and jacuzzi are currently under renovation (this is clearly stated on the website). The concierge wasn't that friendly but they provided a shopping discount coupon for Macy's and they have a binder of restaurant menus. The location is excellent - steps to shopping, Pike Place Market, Cheesecake Factory, restaurants etc. I would stay here again and recommend it. However, parking is $38 as they have valet (separate company) only, but it's available til 6pm the next day. If you decide to check out and have them put your bags into the car, make sure they have the right key to your car!! They almost made a mistake with us.

<Content>Loved the Stay! We booked the Sheraton for a town day pre-cruise stay. It was perfect! After flying from Florida to Seattle we really wanted to just eat and rest. We talked with the concierge and they told us about the restaurants in the area and we chose the Cheesecake Factory which was right across the street. We caught the grayline tour bus at the hotel which was convenient as we were able to hop on and off to many sights. The room was comfortable and cozy. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Mediocre at best Chose the hotel for location and pool. However, pool was closed for renovation. You can use the Westin's pool (5 blocks away) or pay money to use a club. The beds are nice, but that's about it. Rooms and hallways are a bit grim and dark, and none of the drains in the bathrooms worked properly. Needed late checkout, but was told the hotel was too full, which is fine but then they magically made a room available for a few hours for $50. But the key stopped working anyway. This was my first stay at a Sheraton and I won't be doing it again, especially for over $200.

<Content>Close and Yet So Far My boyfriend and I attended the Penny Arcade Expo in the Wash. State Convention Center this summer, and the Sheraton was in the best possible location. This was one of its sole redeeming factors.While the room was spacious, and the furniture was beautiful and well-made, the linens were of the cheapest quality. The towels were thin and scratchy; there were no robes. Our pillowcases were stained, and the room had not been very thoroughly cleaned.We were paying nearly three hundred dollars a night and had booked the room for four straight nights. We considered this cost, though fairly staggering for us, to be worth it. However, when we got there, we were constantly nickel-and-dimed. Over thirty dollars a day for parking. What respectable hotel, especially one with such expensive rooms, would have the gall to also charge lodging for their guests' cars? For what we paid for those rooms, they should have been courteous enough not to ream us on parking. Added to that were the $10/day charge for internet, which I could have gotten for free at just about any coffee shop, and the pay-per-view movies which cost between $10 and $15 dollars each. I understand that these are luxury services and that some fees usually apply, but the blatant avarice of the Sheraton on such matters when they were clearly not hurting for revenue was just appalling.Besides their convenient location, I would mention that the attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency of the staff with whom we interacted were consistently excellent, and it is this, more than anything, that prompts me to give more than one star. The parking attendants in particular were very helpful with allowing us access to the garage if we needed to get to the car, but weren't going anywhere in it.I recommend this hotel only if you don't mind blithely throwing money around, and if you bring your own towels. Next year, we are trying somewhere else.

<Content>Sleepless......... We arrived in Seattle after a long flight from London and our first impression of the Sheraton was very good. The external facade was impressive, the reception bright , spacious and airy and we received a warm welcome.Unfortunately, once we got to our Club Level Room, things began to go downhill. The room, whilst spacious and clean, looked tired and outdated, the colour scheme being shades of beige. The bathroom was small and the bathtub was about a foot deep and practically useless. However the worst was yet to come. After having a meal in the Daily Grill, which was fairly good, we went to bed. That is when the doors started slamming............all night! The door mechanisms failed to work so when everybody entered or exited their rooms the door slammed. You could hear doors slamming 10 rooms away and it coninued into the early hours of the morning. Hence, we did not have a proper nights sleep for 3 nights.When I raised the issue with the front desk, they knew immediately what I was coplaining about, so why has this not been resolved? This just shows contempt for the customer.This is unacceptable for any standard of hotel, never mind a four star establishment. I received a fifty dollar per night credit but frankly would have preferred to sleep.In conclusion, I would not recommend this hotel until they take the comfort of their guests more seriously and sort out the doors.In truth, it was an average hotel with a significant problem.

<Content>Couldn't ask for better I have travelled all over the world and tend to stay in hotels which are 4 or 5 stars. We booked through the Sheraton website and got the room practically for free! (only $156 per night). So I was going into this with the mindset that if things weren't all that great, it was okay, because of the cheap price. I am so happy to say that this hotel was WONDERFUL!The rooms were new, beautifully decorated, and clean.The Sheraton chain is known for their great beds and pillows, and this hotel was no exception, among the best I've slept in. The staff were extremely professional, polite, and friendly. The bellhops and the receptionists were first rate.The location is excellent as it is only a few blocks from Pike Market. There are several restaurant and shopping options all within walking distance. Also, lots of banks nearby (if you need to withrdraw cash, etc).We used room service twice. The food was excellent and recieved very fast. Of course, it was expensive, but hey, it's room service and you're staying in an upscale hotel. If you're looking for an economical or practically priced meal, you need to leave the hotel and eat elsewhere. We also had breakfast in their restaurant. Excellent food, exquisite service. Again, pricey, but hey, if you're on a budget, don't stay at the Sheraton.One more thing to note, their toiletries were wonderful! Mandarin orange and mint soaps, shampoos, and lotions. I didn't even take my own out to use, as theirs were so nice.The only negative thing I can comment on is that when we arrived mid day, we took a nap. During the day it was quite difficult as it was very noisy outside the room, in the hallways. However, at night we had no problems and slept very well.I wouldn't even think about finding another hotel if I'm ever in Seattle again. The Sheraton is just right for me.

<Content>Great service and location This is a great hotel. The location was amazing. We were able to walk to Safeco Field (bit of a walk), the Public Market and shopping. We chose to walk to the Sapce Needle but you can easily get to the monorail a couple of blocks away.The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable.The only problem was the parking. The self parking consisted of the public lots off property or the $38 valet parking. There is no where to park just to check in and the valets will ask you to valet your car immediately or ask you to leave.If you are looking to get drinks with friends, stay away from the hotel lounge. It is way overpriced and the drinks are really watered down. Despite the parking and the hotel lounge it was a great place to stay.

<Content>Pre-Cruise overnight stay Very nice Sheraton hotel that is near everything downtown. Room was very clean. I believe they just finished a major renovation.  The breakfast area was a little small compared to the amount of people this hotel can hold. We waited about 10 minutes for a table. Being this was just an overnite pre-cruise stay I can't really give much more detail. It is only an $8 cab ride to pier 66. Hotel seemed to be very busy on our cruise day. If I ever return to Seattle, I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Fabulous stay We stayed for 3 nights in a corner tower room. The room was very light and airy, modern, very spacious, comfortable bed and spotlessly clean. As Platinum members we had access to the Executive Lounge and free high speed internet access in the room. The continental breakfast was fantastic...the berries were superb and in abundance! Drinks in the evening were also great as were the staff.Lucie at the Concierge desk was extremely helpful. Great stay and will be returning.

<Content>Sheraton a Family Hit Thanks to previous reviewers for guiding me to this hotel. It was a perfect choice for our one-night stay in Seattle before heading to destinations beyond the city. I took the advice of other travelers and requested a room in the new tower. My family of three agreed we were very happy with our choice.The location was excellent, close to shopping and lots of restaurant choices. Close walking distance to Pike's Place and major national retail chains and restaurants. The rooms were modern, well appointed and impeccably maintained. Beds made for a great night鈥檚 sleep. Front desk was very accommodating about our request for a room in the new tower. The concierge was helpful in selecting family friendly restaurantsOur teenager was disappointed the pool was closed (but we knew that going in); the cost of valet parking was very steep and there was no self park option. The bellmen were a bit unhelpful and borderline rude. This was definitely a tourist-dominated area and not for those wanting something more authentic. Overall a real winner with our family.

<Content>Good location. Good quality hotel As other reviews mention this hotel is set in a great location - next to the Convention center and just a short walk from the monorail, shops and Pike Place Market. The rooms are very satisfactory with comfortable beds and good bathrooms. I would say that the hotel is not exceptional in any way just very good quality. I have stayed quite a few times and have always found the lobby to be extremely busy, however there are plenty of elevators and so getting to your room never takes too long. Will have no concerns about staying here on my next visit to Seattle.

<Content>Enjoyed Stay - Convenient to Everything Stayed three nights for business trip. Great rate ($154/nt). Very nice hotel. Staff very professional and very helpful. Beds very comfy. Plenty of hangers, shampoo/conditioner, etc. Eco concious hotel also. Comfortable and tastefully decorated room. Wish I would have asked for higher floor so I would have had a view of the water. Was on 18th. Food on premises, but never tried because so many restaurants, shops, and sight seeing to do - all in walking distance or by public transportation. Fitness room and pool being renovated. Substitute fitness room is very small. Had to get up extra early to get on the bike. Supposed to be finished in late 2008, but looked to be a ways off.

<Content>Perfection! This place is absolutely perfect! The lobby is stunning, and the location can not be beat! You are right downtown....short walk to Pikes Place Market, and all the shopping, food and bars you like! The monorail is literally across the street - it costs $2 and takes you straight to the Space Needle. Our room was nice and was fully stocked with Starbucks Coffee - I really like this because it is a way for a local hotel to showcase a local business (Starbucks originated in Seattle). they aren't stingy with coffee either :) Another thing I LOVE about this hotel is they are trying to be Green. They put directions in your room - they'll only change your sheets if you put a card on the bed, and will give you fresh towels upon request as well. I absolutely love this, and think it's important that such a huge hotel is trying to conserve anyway they can!The front desk was great, and very knowledgeable. We asked for suggestions for great places to go out in Seattle and they delivered! Anytime we called valet for our car - it was waiting for us by the time we got to the front door. there is really nothing I can complain about for this place - If you are going to Seattle, stay here!

<Content>Pretty good hotel in a great location I was here for a conference in July, the best month to be in Seattle. The location of the hotel is perfect. It's in the downtown area surrounded by a lot of upscale stores (J. Crew, Anthropologie, Nordstrom's and Macy's amonth others) and plenty of restaurants and coffee shops (there's a Starbucks every other block). I am not a Sheraton fan but the hotel had a few major positives:1) THE CONCIERGE: the 3 women who work the concierge desk deserve a raise. They are friendly, competent and available at all times. They booked dinner for us, a cruise of the Puget Sound and a lunch and all worked out perfectly.2) The beds and linens were very comfortable.3) You can enter the business center with your room key to use the internet. Most hotels charge for this but their service is free.A few negatives:1) Housekeeping could do a better job. The room was cleaned, but not well. And a coworker staying with me had to call twice to have someone even come do her room.2) The food at the Daily Grill was average and overpriced (but hey--you have a thousand restaurants to choose from nearby and we just grabbed a scone at Starbucks after not enjoying the first breakfast!).3) Most of the employees seem to be going through the motions. Aside from the fabulous concierge, I sensed an apathy among the staff there............as if this is just a job was the thing going through their minds as they helped us. I got this feeling with the bellhops, the front desk people, the waiters at the Daily Grill. It is not that they seem unhappy, but their smiles came across as false. But overall it's a comfortable, convenient place to stay and I would come back.

<Content>Location, Location! We got this four star hotel for 90 a night on Priceline and it was a very good deal. The hotel is in a great location for checking out the downtown Seattle, you can walk everywhere and shopping is very close. Pike Market is just down the street a few blocks. The Space Needle is a short cab ride or you can take the tram or even walk 20 min.The hotel is super busy! If you want something more mellow I would suggest not staying here, there was alot of conventions and people everywhere and getting your car around noon was a bit busy, but the staff was quick and friendly.The hotel was busy but the rooms were quiet and clean.If you want a view you might want to ask, or you'll be looking a roof tops and office windows.No complaints. Good Stay!

<Content>Great Hotel in Central Seattle The hotel seemed to match its 4 star rating. Very professional staff, clean and impressive rooms. It wasn't perfect though. The halls and elevators need a little update but it's a busy place.I got a special rate through my professional association at $214 per night. Note that the hotel is one block away from the convention center and within walking distance of Pikes Place Market.

<Content>Nice Stay at the Sheraton I stayed at the Sheraton for two nights in July while in the Seattle area on business. I was assigned a club floor room in the Pike St. Tower. Although the Pike St. tower is the older of the two, the rooms and corridors are still quite clean and fresh.I happened to be on the 34th floor, just below the fitness center and pool on the 35th floor which were under renovation. There was quite a bit of drilling/jack hammering going on from about 9:00AM until about 4:00PM, which was annoying, but at least it wasn't going on at 6AM.A temporary fitness facility has been setup in the newer tower, and it does the job.The room was comfortable with a nice, large flat panel television and plenty of space to spread out. The hotel staff was friendly and the check-in process was quick and efficient.The location is also great with plenty of shopping and restaurants within a quick walk from the front doors. I stayed at the Westin Seattle last year and the Sheraton's location is much nicer.All in all, a pleasant stay.

<Content>Great Location Stayed here for 2 nights to see a Mariners game at Safeco. While expensive (we paid $294 plus parking) I imagine it's pretty typical for the area. Had a room on the 25th floor in the Union Tower (the newer of the two buildings) with a nice view of the city.As a previous reviewer mentioned, the fitness center and pool are closed for renovations. Had we been there for a longer stay, I would have been upset that I was not advised of this beforehand. Since we were there for only 2 nights, it was no big deal.The hotel is very nice - fairly typical for a big city chain hotel. They did have free internet access in the lobby with 5 or 6 computers which was a plus.As mentioned before, the location is the best attribute - near Pike's Market, monorail, and most major Seattle downtown attractions. We even walked to and from Safeco, though I would suggest staying with the crowds after the game, as we were told not to walk alone on the streets downtown at night. Concierge desk was very helpful with recommendations for restaurants, directions, etc.Overall, great location but pricey and I would probably stay here again.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Seattle We spent 2 nights at the Sheraton in Seattle and thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Great downtown location that makes it extremely accessible to all the local sights and sounds. Pike Place Mkt was 5 blocks away and the MonoRail was 2 blocks away. Plenty of dining options located in and around the hotel.Friendly and helpful staff -- very easy check-in and check-out.

<Content>Very pleasant stay We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton since it was the HQ hotel for our convention. It was so convenient to the WA Convention Center where our meetings were. We walked everywhere since the location is so convenient to shopping, Pike Place Market  restaurants. Even though the hotel was sold out for the meetings, we were able to check in early. We had a room on the top floor (for Sheraton Preferred Guests) of the new Union Tower which had a fair view between other buildings. Because we are SPG members, water was complimentary  we were greeted with a bottle of sparkling wine  a box of Dilletante's chocolates. More important to me was the quiet room, comfortable Sheraton Sleeper bed, clean, shiny bathroom, thick towels and quality sheets. However, the room was not very big  barely had enough storage space for clothes for two people. We were told the pool would be closed, but I used the adequate work out facility in the Union Tower. We parked our car using the valet service and had excellent service w/the bellman  valet. We did not eat at the restaurant, but did go to the bar and we found it strange that on a weekend night, when the hotel is sold out that last call was at midnight. We would stay there again.

<Content>Ruined our aniversary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seattle Sheraton listed as a 4 Star, Beware not even close, maybe a 2 if that. Went to Seattle for our Aniversary. They put us in a small room, with a horrible view. The worst thing was the beds were so small, we had to sleep in seperate beds!!!! The Pool, Spa, And exercise facility's are all closed and will not reopen until October, I think is the month the lady at the front desk said. She was very rude, and said the Hotel had notified Priceline of the facility closures. Our room was not cleaned properly, towels looked like they were thrown on the hooks, dirty glasses not exchanged, beds looked horrible and the pillows were on the floor??? Better bring alot of extra cash. Stayed 2 days parking was 56 bucks. The water in the room is not drinkable, However you can buy there's $$$$. Food in over cooked, at least the water in cafe was drinkable, and don't be fooled by there complimentary newspaper, if you read the sticker the put on it you will see that you will be charged for it to $$$$. Thanks for our ruined Aniversary Seattle Sheraton. Next time We will stay at the Camlin or one of the other real 4 Star hotels in the same area!!!!!!!!

Very good value for the $112/night deal I got on Priceline. I had a room in the Union Street tower which was very comfortable although the view left something to be desired. The location was perfect. I parked my car for the entire weekend and walked everywhere. I parked at the garage at Pike  7th, which is a block from the hotel and $28 per 24 hours - I believe the hotel is $35. It's not a huge difference but I only have one key for my car at the moment so didn't want to surrender it to the valet, in case I wanted to get something from my car. The check in and other staff were very polite. I didn't eat at the restaurant so can't speak to that, but I did see two locals getting take out from there, which is always a good sign.The only thing I could possibly complain about, is that I was given incorrect directions from a hotel staffer which I believe was an honest mistake. Unfortunately, given the circumstances (night time, one way streets) it was an enormous inconvenience to me that, at the time, made me absolutely livid.

<Content>A nice hotel, though a bit pricey Enjoyed a nice stay for a convention. Pluses, nicely decorated rooms, high definition plasma television, nice shampoos and conditioners. Opportunities for improvement: didn't understand the green policy as some towels I left on the hook were changed. Others that I left off the hook were not changed. Sometimes I had 3 sets of towels, sometimes 2 sets.I found it a little odd that in the capitol of coffee, there wasn't a coffee stand available in the hotel. The closest Starbucks was a half block away at the Hyatt. Why one couldn't be made available in the hotel was a little odd.One inconvenience was that the work out room was being renovated and not available during my stay.If you are attending a meeting at the convention center, the Sheraton is directly across the street, but many other hotels are extremely short walks and less expensive. I'd probably recommend another hotel as the amenities were really nothing to write home about and the hotel is more costly.

<Content>Great Location, No so great Customer Service Great Location to downtown Seattle. Just around the corner is the monorail to Space Needle and EMP. Loved EMP and so did my family. Walking distance to Pike Market. We were on the 32 floor nice views. Checked in late that evening, hotel staff was very rude especially a manager 1 night and a little prejudice. Price not worth the service look for another hotel in the area.

<Content>fabulous location 2 girlfriends went to seattle for a weekend to celebrate a retirement. bought the room on priceline for $125 and after taxes about $150. valet parking was STEEP --$35 !!!! but considering the location of the hotel, it was in the heart of all the shopping!asked for a room in union tower ..only room left was a handicap room with 2 queenbeds so that was fine...only catch with a handicap room is that there is NO tub but with a large shower with a seat...it worked out fine for us because we didn't want to bathe but rather shower. room had small flat screen LG tv, new faucets and great beds.room even had 5 pouches of starbucks coffee and tazo tea which were handy ! the only thing is that there was no bar/lounge in the hotel other than a very tiny deli. the lobby was huge and very nice and the hotel is so central that every block was in the heart of the shopping. nike town is just next door and pacific place mall/nordstroms were just one block away.walking to pike market took only 10min so you can't beat the location. the only complaint i have is the very expensive parking...$35..i think that is probably a few bucks higher than the fairmont. my girlfriend and i just left the car with valet and never touched it until we checked out. we walked everywhere and even came back to the hotel room to drop off packages from shopping twice in a day...so no big deal...had a bottle of wine which we purchased from wal mart and had our own happy hour in the room. great...would definitely return to sheraton.

<Content>great priceline rate and large room We live in a Seattle suburb and wanted to stay downtown for a wedding. I selected a 4 star in downtown Seattle on priceline for $99. The reservation was accurate and there were no problems at check in. We were given a king bed in the old tower. The room was large with a comfortable bed. However, under the duvet was a traditional old blanket. Who knows when it was last washed...I was surprised to see that in such a high end chain hotel. The other motel like feature were thin and rough towels. Valet parking was $35 and wired internet was $10.

<Content>Great location This is a great classy hotel in the heart of downtown Seattle. It is a very short 10 minute walk to Pike's Market, the downtown library, Belltown area, and many other areas. We booked the tickets through priceline and we were able to get a great price. Our room faced 6th avenue and had a view of the water in the distance. Pros: location, comfortable bed, very helpful staff, and they stored our luggage even after we had checked out. Cons: you had to pay for internet access daily. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great loaction and design - maybe a little too corporate for my liking. Stayed here for a couple of nights in May. Very large twin double room. Very tastefully decorated with huge extremely comfy beds. (Why can't European hotels take note of the fantastic beds provided by most US chains? It really makes a difference!). Great night's sleep. Very central location. Beautifully appointed if a bit impersonal. This is very obviously geared towards the business/corporate guest as witnessed by the lobby both in terms of its size and layout. Main gripe - a little on the pricey side especially if you add in breakfast/valet parking.Seattle was very cool - really liked 1st/ 2nd Avenue area for funky stores and restaurants. Just ignore the homeless issue in these neighbourhoods. Also new Sculpture Park is a little Oasis of calm in this busy city...

<Content>Great Location - reservation mixup Great hotel in a superb location. I was in the new tower and was there to attend a conference. The facilities were superb and food was excellent. Other than a mixup with the fact that I extended my original reservation - I would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very nice hotel, would certainly recommend to others... Booked a 4 night stay on Hotwire.com ($153/night), months prior to our visit. The Hotwire reservation gave us a standard room (2 beds), in the older tower. I took the advice of others and requested a King room in the newer tower (Union St.). Though the hotel couldn't grant our request until check-in, the front desk effortlessly obliged. Right away I felt our stay was a great value. The King room was spacious, impeccably clean, and had an exceptionally comfortable bed. What more do you need? There was of course Starbucks coffee in the room, a convenient business area in the lobby, and a knowledgeable, helpful concierge desk (all at no addt'l cost). It had the glamour  perks of a 4-star hotel without being stuffy.If I had to nit-pick; there was no free breakfast, no refrigerator, and a plain-jane tub/shower. But these are easy to forget.We didn't rent a car (public transportation and our feet were definitely sufficient), since the hotel is right in the middle of everything. We walked to the Pike St. market every day, did some shopping, and had a lot of coffee. The bus will take you to Alki beach (highly recommended), or most any other destination for dirt cheap.

<Content>Great location and hotel This hotel is within walking distance to Pike Public Market, retailers, and monorail to Seattle Center. The room was very well maintained and spacious. Our view from the 24th overlooked the nearby Westin but also the roofs of quite a few other buildings. The hotel is next to the Convention Center and this probably encourages maintenance. The gym was being upgraded; however, nearby options were offered at no additional cost.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We loved this hotel in downtown Seattle. The location was great--close to Pikes Market and great shopping. It was our first time in Seattle and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The room was spacious and spotless. The bedding heavenly--we were on the club level and we were pleasantly surprised at the great continental breakfast. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Location...Nice Hotel.. Great views BUT. If you want shopping, then this is the place to stay. It was next to the convention center, across the street from gameworks and regal cinemas. There is an old navy and pacific place is a block away among other big retail stores. Ross, Macy's Nordstroms, and Sephora are also right around the corner. I got into town a little early and wanted to drop my bag off (me and my son were going to a Mariner's game) so I could go shopping for a few hours without dragging it around. The girl at check-in was glad to help but seemed to be annoyed that I didnt want a room other than what I requested. I had already budgeted for the room I had reserved. My room wasnt ready for another hour so I pre-registered and left. I came back an hour later and the lines for check in were LONG. I had saw a sign for pre-registered key pick up so I went to that line where some cocky guy was helping the lines (very annoyed by the fact he had to come out of his office or the back) ignored me and then I realized I had to wait in line again. and then he called out for a group of people and said.. If you are pre-registered then come over here.. I guess I didnt look the part. I got to check in and that went smoothly and got a room on the 16th floor overlooking pike street. The room was nice, big and airy. There was a lcd tv which my son was ecstatic about and then there was some 4 dollar expired chips (about a month expired) sitting on the dresser. The bed was okay, kinda hard for my liking but the comforter was awesome. The swimming pool is closed right now, but we werent going to be at the hotel long enough to use it. The amenities say that there is a frig but it was considered a mini bar so it really wasnt for guest use unless you wanted to buy high priced soda's and booze. I will come back , when they renovations are done, because it is in a great location for shopping but the service was so-so, not what you expect for a 4 star hotel, they made me feel like I was supposed to be glad they were even waiting on me. The restaurant was pricey, but they do take out and we didnt have to go anywhere after the game. Overall get a deal for this place, and dont pay full price but if shopping is what you are in town for, then this is the place.

<Content>Great location! I booked this hotel through Priceline for the 9th - 12th. I took the advice of others of requesting the newer tower. Our room was very clean and new. The hotel lobby was nice and the lounge a good place to watch some sports and grab a drink. The best thing about this place was the location. We walked everywhere. It's only 6 blocks to Pike Place and we walked there every morning. The exercise room was small, but fine (nice view). The pool needed some remodeling, but my 5 year old liked it fine.

<Content>Great location, inconsistent service I booked this Sheraton hotel in downtown Seattle via Hotwire for two nights. Arrived at the hotel at around 11:30am and asked for early check-in. The front desk staff was nice. Upon seeing my SPG Gold membership card, she checked me in, even though technically Hotwire bookings do not qualify for SPG Gold benefits.The room and amenities are what you would normally expect from a 4-star Sheraton. The best thing about this hotel is its location. It's just a few blocks walk to the Pike Place market, the water front. Monorail station is just 2 blocks away. Plenty of shopping and restaurant nearby.I usually leave a decent tip everyday with a Thank you note in the room for the maid when I stay in a hotel. This is on one hand customary, on the other hand I hope if I accidentally leave something behind, the maid cleaning the room will be nice enough to turn it in. The first day, the maid took the tip and left me a thank you note. The second day, I left the tip and checked out at around noon.That evening, I discovered that I had forgotten my laptop power adapter in the Sheraton hotel room. I called the hotel immediately. The guest service rep took my room number, dates of stay, name and phone number, and said that they would call me if someone turns it in. There was no indication that they are trying to look for it. I expect at least they should 1) if the room has not been rented out, send someone to check; or 2) if the room was rented out, send a message to the new guest.One week passed and no phone call. I called again because I was about to pass through Seattle. The guest service simply said that we have your inquiry on file. If it turns up, we will call you. Again no indication of any willingness to help.I know that leaving something behind is my mistake, but I am still disappointed that the hotel guest service is not as helpful as a 4-star hotel should be.

<Content>Great downtown hotel Just returned from the Sheraton in Seattle. I am a travel agent (Journeys Around the World) so try out many hotels each year. I was in Seattle for a conference  it is right next door to the Convention Center, which was very convenient. The hotel is very very nice...beautiful lobby, spacious rooms, nice lobby bar (and very popular)  good restaurant (although pricey). Stayed in the new tower  the rooms were very nice with new flat screen tv. And with it being Seattle, there was Starbucks coffee in the room (with real creamer, rather than the powdered stuff!). The location of the hotel is great...Nordstroms is just a block away and Pike Street Market just a short stroll! The hotel was perfect for business or pleasure.

<Content>Worst 4 star shower ever I want to assure you I did not priceline this hotel, i wanted to be sure I stayed at the Sheraton and so I didn't risk it and paid the full price. Not cheap, anyway my gripe is this, the view was blah, and the room was blah, and the shower was a joke. Not 4 star quality, the linens and the bed comfort wise was great. The lobby was that of a 4star hotel, as was the valet parking price, the restaurant's breakfast was not. My biggest gripe was not the mishmash furniture in the room or even the 15 year old tv. My biggest let down was the shower, the tap had to practically be on the furthest hot setting for it to be even bearably warm and the water did not drain properly so I had to sit in 6 inches of water (cold water) while taking a shower. I did not complain to management as I was only there one night and only used the shower the morning I was leaving so there was nothing to be done at that point.

<Content>Can I move in? My husband and I went to Seattle to see a Dave Matthews show, and stayed in the Sheraton (Main Tower/ King) for one night. The Hotel is in an EXCELLENT location. There is no need to rent a car. Get a round trip ticket on The Gray Line bus from the airport and you'll be able to walk or use public transportation for the rest of your trip. We were able to check in early, 11:00 am. I had read other reviews saying to stay in the newer tower, however, I found the old tower very nice and updated. My only regret is that we only stayed one night!

<Content>Book Through Priceline As many other reviewers suggested you can get this place for $100 a night on priceline. They easily accomadated my request for a King room in the new tower. It was a beautiful hotel in the perfect location. We walked everywhere and took the ferry to Bainbridge and the bus to the locks in Ballard. Nobody should be renting a car to stay here. Take the bus downtown from the airport, $1.50 a person and it takes 1/2 hour. Parking is expensive in every downtown hotel, get used to it and use public transport.

<Content>The Lowdown I am a VERY frequent stayer at the Sheraton Seattle, and, as travel season approaches, I just want to make sure I get my 2 cents in. First off, there is only valet parking on-site. It's 35 dollars a day with in and out privileges until 6pm the following day. If you choose to self park your car, the garage at 7th and Pike (behind the Cheesecake Factory) is 28 dollars/day with in/out privileges as well. Make sure to see the valet booth outside to get your pass to hang on your mirror to give you these privileges. If you don't want in/out, convention center parking is probably the way to go.If you can, catch the Greyline Downtown Airporter (roughly 10/11 dollars each way) to/from the airport (about 45 minutes). Metro city bus is 1.75 to 2.25 and takes 30minutes.Check in is at 3, but, if you arrive early, the front desk will try to get you in. Because it is the largest hotel in the Northwest (I think), there are plenty of business men and convention-goers and it gets pretty noisy/hectic in the lobby, so I probably wouldn't recommend it for a romantic getaway... Once cruise season starts, be prepared to have to wait for your room until normal check-in time at 3pm, and sometimes after. Of course, if you prepay on Priceline/Expedia/Hotwire/Orbitz, you are not guaranteed a room type. It gets difficult to try to switch room types in the Spring/Summer because the hotel is consistently full! Connecting rooms are very hard to get, too, so try and call ahead and as often as possible until they give you them. When they are sold out, they might try to offer you a parlor. This is basically just a living room with no beds! So they will put a twin sized bed in there (its still comfortable) and will drop your rate to 99 dollars! It's great if it's just you, or you and your friends. There are two towers: Union (the new one) and Pike (the original one). The only way to be guaranteed a room in Union is to book a Deluxe room. Otherwise, they can put you in either tower, and the rooms are completely different. Pike is 35 stories and has the pool/fitness center in it, as well as the Club Lounge. Union is 26 stories and has the business center in it. The views are better from Pike because half the rooms in Union stare straight back at Pike. If you can book a corner room (they cost a little more... like 20 bucks?) take it. They are awesome rooms. Bliss products in the room, Starbucks coffee, too. They are pet friendly and offer doggy beds to be brought to your room for free! The fitness center/pool area needs work, though. Free wi-fi in the lobby, 10 dollars to connect internet in your room. DO NOT USE THE PHONE! Local calls AND toll free are charged!! They just added a coffee shop, and gift shop, which are much needed additions to their lounge and their restaurant (Daily Grill). Check-out is at 12noon, and free late checkout is at 1pm. If you are Starwood Gold or Platinum, you get 4pm free late check-out! ALSO! Gold members don't get free upgrades to the Concierge Floor.. but SPG floors which have free bottled water. You can store your luggage at the bell desk, and leave your car in the valet and take a quick stroll to Pike Place or go shopping! I am there too often, can you tell?

<Content>Good place to stay, but it could be better Overall, I had a good stay. I did not purchase anything at the hotel restaurants so I can't say anything about the food there. I was disappointed that the gift shop did not have milk, and I wasn't about to pay what they wanted in the restaurant for a glass of milk. I didn't try the swimming pool and workout area. The main reason is that they were in a separate tower. It seemed a little inconvenient to take the elevator down, walk across the lobby to the other tower and then take the elevator up to wherever that was located. I was also disappointed in the internet service. I tried to connect from my room, but the connection was slow and did not work for very long. I eventually went downstairs to the lobby to use the free internet which worked much better. The hotel was very good about refunding the price of the internet service that I had paid for, but if they are going to make you pay they should at least offer dependable service. Another thing that I didn't like is that they did not give me all of the credit for my stay with the Starwood points program. I only got credit for $2 worth of expenses for a 4 night stay, so I had to send proof of my expenses to get credit for the rest of the expenses. Otherwise, I was satisfied with the room. It was a good size, and everything was in working order. But I definitely wouldn't call this an Excellent stay.

<Content>Not impressive. My husband was attending a conference at the hotel and we chose to stay directly at the hotel for the latter part of the conference. The first few days we spent at the Alexis which was absolutely gorgeous. Even though we booked directly through the Sheraton's website, they were unable to accommodate us with a room in the newly refurbished section of the hotel unless we chose a room with only double beds. Although the room was good sized, it was very drab. The bathroom was cramped compared to what the Alexis offered, and the toiletries provided were way too perfumey. What can I say, a simple pleasure of mine is to enjoy the lotions, etc. that the hotel provides. On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable and the heater noise was minimal. The front desk staff was also very nice.They nickel and dime you though. $12/day including tax for internet? Give me a break. I was spoiled by the room and amenities at the Alexis, and that's the only place I'll stay next time.

<Content>Great after renovation I have stayed at the Sheraton before the renovation and it was OK, dated, but not horrible. However, now the hotel is just great. Lobby looks amazing, fresh and luxurious. The rooms are great, updated in all possible ways. I cannot tell if the walls are very well insulated, or if the hotel was half-empty, but it was very quiet in the room. Location of the hotel is obviously excellent, right in the middle of downtown.On the negatives, the ice machine in our floor had not been turned on. Parking is very expensive and valet is slow at peak times. Hotel needs a bar with extended hours, we wanted one more rounds of drinks just after midnight on a Saturday night and nothing in the hotel was open. The staff could not tell where a closest bar would be.

<Content>Perfectly situated downtown I just returned from a weekend visit to Seattle and had the pleasure of staying at the Sheraton. This is a popular, bustling, and well-appointed hotel that is ideally located downtown -- minutes from Pike Place, the Seattle Art Museum, the Waterfront, high-end shopping, delightful restaurants for foodies and all the must-sees for the first-time visitor. I snagged quite the bargain on Priceline for $109/night. Take the ultra-convenient and reasonably priced ($17/roundtrip) Gray Line shuttle from SEA-TAC airport, which stops at all the major downtown hotels.Outside of the hotel itself, some quick recommendations:Make one breakfast stop at Le Panier across from Pike Place. Decadent pastries and bracing coffee. My recommendation is the caffe americano with an almond croissant. If you want to escape out of the city, there is an Alamo rental office in the Hilton, which is only a couple of blocks away. We took the ferry over to Bainbridge Island and drove to Port Townsend, a cute seaside town that offers a number of galleries with a focus on handmade jewelry and local art. (Wish I had gotten more!)

<Content>Loved it all....thanks, Priceline! Booked through Priceline at the last minute for a quick getaway for myself and my husband. We live about 40 minutes north of Seattle and came over the the ferry.Check-in was a breeze - we asked for a king bed (knowing that with Priceline you usually get two doubles) and not only did we get that, but were put in the newly renovated tower in a corner room! (#1252 if you are interested.) Great city views with a peek-a-boo of the water at the ferry terminal.The room was lovely - very neutral toned with great linens, flat screen tv, huge desk and an armoire/closet in it's own seperate location near the entrance. I have not one complaint about the room - it was lovely.We are dinner down the street at the Taphouse Grill - good food, not too expensive. For those of you who are beer lovers, they have 160 on tap. We could have eaten in the hotel, and the Cheesecake Factory and Morton's were also within walking distance. Then we walked to Pacific Place, did some shopping and saw a movie. Evenything is really close by so you can walk.Breakfast at the Daily Grille in the hotel was just so-so. I always think it's kind of hard not to make a good breakfast, but I guess I was wrong.So, for a bid of $100.00, I think we more that got our money's worth and I would definitely stay here again......

<Content>Good Place to Stay Overall, a very nice hotel as one would expect from staying at a Sheraton and paying a little over $200 for a room. Customer service both at curbside and front desk were top notch. We had adjoining rooms on the 24th floor with good views of the city. The pool is located on the 35th floor and was smaller than I expected. Weight room and sauna also on 35th floor. View from there was really amazing. Hotel was very accommodating, giving the kids (5 of them!!!) coloring books and a goodie bag upon check-in. Rooms were quiet, beds were firmer than I prefer but still comfortable. Internet service available for free in lobby only, which surprised me. You had to pay for wireless in your room. We did not try the restaurant or lounge. Hotel is within 5-6 blocks of Pike Place Market and only a block away from TRAM and mall. Lots of things to do and see within easy walking distance...even with five kids in tow! I would stay here again when visiting Seattle, the location was very convenient for us.

<Content>Sheraton's the place to stay!! Stayed at this hotel with my gf for the Easter long weekend. The central location downtown was why we decided on it. Booking was easy with the hotel's website and was a really good price with their stay friday promo ($129) which is great considering it is a four star hotel. After we got the confirmation number, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a room in the Union Street Tower (UST) which is the newer (2007) slightly shorter (26 floors) building, as opposed the Pike Street Tower (built in 1982, renovated 2004). The front desk said she would put a note on our reservation which was confirmed when we checked in. Amazing lobby! The room was perfect. At the end corner of the floor so with windows on two adjacent walls (only could hear the ice machine a little). Only on the 7th floor, and facing the highway exit, but not noisy from street at all. Super clean room, immaculate bathroom. Big king bed and flat screen plasma (note: go to TV guest services to get local weather in Celsius). To top it all off, we totally lucked out with an all sunny weekend (in Seattle no less!!) Only one downside was parking. In heart of downtown have to pay, but we took another reviewer's tip and did not use the hotel's $35 a day (out by 6pm but with in-out privilages) which has to be declared upon check-in (add added to your bill). Instead tried the convention centre which is one block north of the hotel. First nite parked at 6:30pm and got the car out by 6:00p the next day = $30. Second nite parked 9:30pm (after the convention centre closes) and got the car out 1:30pm=$22. No in-out privilages but okay since we were mainly walking downtown. Good luck!

<Content>Excellant Downtown Seattle Location The newly renovated Seattle Sheraton is in an excellant downtown location and highly recommended for those travelling without a car who want to be close to what downtown Seattle has to offer. It is within easy walking distance to great shopping, nightlife, the monorail to Seattle Centre, theatres, galleries, Pike Place Market and many many restaurant options. Being Seattle there is also at least one coffee shop per block. Our room was a decent size, clean and our check in was easy despite the hotel being very busy over Easter/Spring Break weekend. The bathroomwas not quite as nice as many Sheraton's we have stayed in before, perhaps we were not in a newly renovated room, i.e.older tub and tile and they did not have robes as advertised, but these are petty concerns really. Overall it was a great stay for a resonable $160 CAN per night. They have free wi-fi in the lobby and user pay wi-fi in your room for $9.99 Parking is paid additionally as well.Overall because of the great location we were able to quickly fit in many auxillary activities such as Pike Place and Music Experience while travelling to Seattle for an pre-planned event. I would stay here again just for this reason.We had a great meal at Boom Noodle - 12th and Pike! Check it out.

<Content>Great place to stay We stayed at the Sheraton for 3 nights in March and thought we got a GREAT deal. I think I priced every hotel downtown and eventually bid on Priceline for the room. It was significantly cheaper than the other hotels. We could not get a King bed which was the only bad point, but they did change us to a room higher up with a nice view of the water. The gym is very good and looks like they are making it even bigger in the future. The pool and hot tub are fine, kinda old looking but have a great view. The service was good, although the prices at the resturant/bar and gift shop are spendy. You are located near everything downtown-bars, shopping, resturants, 1 block from the monorail and about 6 blocks from Pike Market. I would stay at this hotel everytime I went to Seattle. Watch their website, cause they offer great prices online too.

<Content>Wonderful Stay I had to stay at this hotel for two weeks for my job and the hotel was wonderful, the se\rvice was great the only mistake was one day the room was not clean when I returned that afternoon but the service desk quickly fix that error and offered my a free movie. My wife and I did a lot of walking and the hotel is in a great area of town. The Market and Mall are all in walking distance and if you wanted to take a long stroll you could even walk to the tower.

<Content>Relaxing Stay in a Great Location The Sheraton Hotel is in a prime location in the heart of downtown Seattle. It is so convenient for shopping and an easy stroll away from the Pike Place Market. I have stayed at the hotel many times and the staff have always been professional and courteous. The opening of the new Pine Street tower and completion of the lobby renovations have added to the attractiveness of the hotel. The room decor is very comfortable and furnishings are well thought out. I really liked the new Bliss Mandarin Mint bath products.

<Content>Customer service is TERRIBLE! The valets just stand around and stare at you instead of getting your keys or asking if you need help. The hotel charged 40 dollars of food to my room when i never got rom service and they charged 3 movies instead of 2. Since they said they couldnt do anything they said I had to call accounting.....Why do I need to call when it was not my mistake!!

<Content>Nice place, good staff, clean and good location I used Priceline Name your own price and got a room for a 2 night stay for $101 a night. When I got there it was about noon and I had to wait until after 2:30 to check in but they held our bags for us  we just went out and grabbed some lunch. There was a little bit if a mix-up regarding my request for a king size bed but the management ended up upgrading me to a corner room (larger room, HDTV, king bed) and didn't charge us.We also asked to be put in the new tower, as recommended by other people here. It was nice but we explored the older tower and it was nice too. My only complaint about the new tower is that the pool/spa/workout area is located on top of the OLD tower and you have to go through the lobby to get to it. If we knew that then we would of been happy to have a room in the old tower.Free wifi in the lobby but you have to pay for it in the room. A GREAT room safe! I have a larger laptop and this is the first hotel that it could be locked up with room to spare.The staff was professional and polite, and they actually knew the answers to any questions I asked. The place was spotless, even with a convention going on. We asked for robes and they happily supplied 2 nice comfy ones...no charge.My only minuses were the bed was a little hard (but still comfy) and the additional fees for the little things...which is typical of the hotels in Seattle anyway. Parking was $35 a day and in-room internet was $11 a day.Otherwise: nice size rooms, good security, friendly staff, clean, and the employees were professional and friendly. If you are flying in I would suggest not renting a car as down Seattle can get crazy  parking is expensive. This hotel was within walking distance to most attractions (the Space Needle has a monorail a couple of blocks away) and I would be happy to stay there again. A cab from/to the airport is about $30. They have a generic shuttle that runs through a string of different hotels for $18 round trip pp.

<Content>Stay here. Dont go anywhere else. We stayed in the new tower and got a corner room. The bed was comfy and the room was just amazing. The amenties and decor make you feel like you're staying in a 4-5 star hotel. The location is so convenient to everything. Everyone from the front desk to valet is are very friendly. We would definitely come back not just because the hotel was great but the rate was fantastic for what youre getting. You can get an amazing rate right from the sheraton website.

<Content>Best downtown location We go to Seattle often, but this was the first time we stayed at the Sheraton. I chose it because of the positive reviews I read on TripAdvisor, the fantastic promo they had on their website ($129 + tax for the weekend) and the location.I was really impressed with their renovated modern lobby, it felt similar to the W (another Starwood hotel) but larger. The staff was more mature  friendlier than the W. There's ample seating in the lobby to read the newspaper, an area of computers for guests, a takeout cafe/bakery and a restaurant/grill...from what I saw.We requested the renovated Union St Tower and were really happy with the room - decent downtown view, new furnishings, very comfortable and contemporary. There was a flatscreen TV, Starbucks coffee and Bliss products in the room.To make it even better they should add robes and a complimentary bottle of water - the tap water was too chlorinated and the mini bar bottled water was $4. The location is perfect because it's so close to Pike Place market, downtown shopping and the great restaurants in Belltown. Everything that we needed was within 1 block or 2: bank, coffee shop, pharmacy, great stores  parking.We parked in the Convention Centre lot for $24/night versus paying $35/night at the hotel. The Centre is safe because it's either packed with cars during the day or closed at night.We ate at some fantastic restaurants: Tavolata and Union. There's a cool lounge around the corner from the hotel called Vessel with great cocktails, music and interior. For breakfast we ate at the market (lots of options) but didn't have a good experience at Cafe Campagne...we waited 45 min for breakfast and then it was served cold. To top it off they weren't too apologetic.

<Content>Stay in the remodeled tower Make sure you request a room in the remodeled tower!! We stayed one night in the old tower and the rooms were very old and tired. The second night they switched us to one of the newer rooms and it was great and very modern. The location of the hotel is perfect...you can walk everywhere. We loved Seattle and would definitely stay here again just in the newer rooms!

<Content>Location, Location, Location! The Sheraton is located in the heart of downtown, but not too close to noisy tourist traps. It is a very walkable distance to Pike's Place Market and accessible to all public transportation.Although I expected the room to be a bit more modern in style, it was very comfortable. Our king size bed was soft, and there was plenty of space to move about in the room. The bathroom was also quite sizable. The ammenities are great. The pool and the jacuzzi are on the top floor, and are a great way to relax after a long day walking around. The staff was pleasant, and very helpful. Ask for a higher floor and get a great view of the bay!

<Content>Great place to stay I only stayed at this hotel for one night, but for the short time I was here I really liked it. This hotel was a really close walk to lots of shops and the Pike Place Market. It was a 5 minute walk to the market. I took the recommendations on here and requested the new tower and was really impressed. The rooms were modern with nice furnishings and very clean! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The lobby was very nice and comfortable. I have not one single complaint about this hotel.

<Content>Great location and more! The hotel is centrally located with just about everything you'd want to see and do downtown within walking distance. The lobby is beautiful with comfortable and intimate seating areas. Our room on the 17th floor was perhaps the quietest and cleanest room I've ever stayed in. Slept great in the very comfortable bed. Check out the Purple Cafe and Wine Bar for some tasty local wine selections and fun atmosphere. Great experience at this hotel, and I would stay there again in a heart beat!

<Content>Great Location and Nice Hotel I booked this hotel on recommendations from other reviews on TripAdvisor. This was my first trip to Seattle.The hotel lobby looked like it was recently updated and the new wing looked great. Unforunately we were put in the old Tower. I forgot to request a room in the newer Union Square tower. This was the only downfall to my stay here. I got a great deal through priceline so I guess I shouldn't complain.The location of this hotel was perfect. Only several blocks away from the Monorail that takes you to the Space Needle. Walking distance to Pike Place, Nordstrom, Macy's. There is a Regal Cinema, Gamworks, Niektown, American Eagle, and The Cheesecake Factory right across the street. You won't need a car unless you want to go outside of downtown. I was debating whether I should get a car and I am glad I didn't. Parking at the hotel is $35 for overnight guest which is very pricey. You can take the bus around the free zone which is much downtown from 6am to 7pm.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Sheraton because we were in town for a wedding and the Church and Reception was close to our hotel. Little did we know when we booked this hotel that it was very close to all of the Seattle attractions. The hotel is located downtown near all of the shopping. The Monterail is two blocks away and that will take you down to the Space Needle. Pike's Place Market, where they throw the fish, is only 5 blocks down, about a 15 min walk. We did not rent a car, everything we wanted to do was in walking distance.We took a taxi to the hotel from the Sea-Tac airport. It was about a 15-20 min drive and it cost $35. If you want to go cheaper than that you can take the bus for $10.25 per person.We arrived almost three hours before check-in time. But it was not a problem they already had a room ready for us. We were on the 29th floor and had a beautiful view of the city. I would recommend this hotel to anyone we really liked it. They also have free internet for guests. My only complaint was the bathroom sink drain was broken and the service at the restaurant was not very good. Other than that we would definitly stay here again!

<Content>Good Option Downtown, Nice new tower! Stayed at the Seattle Sheraton for one night in December before the Holidays. Have stayed here in the past, and enjoyed returning to the remodeled lobby and new tower. Stayed in the new tower in a corner King (very nice room). Booked the Macy's gift card special, 212, for room and a 100 gift card to Macy's. Not a bad deal for the room at 112.Check in was very fast. The new tower is a bit of walk to the elevators, so if that is an issue, I would ask for the old tower. As others have said the pool and gym are not in the new tower, so getting to the pool/gym, you must walk through the main lobby and go up to the 35th floor of the old tower.Room was fantastic, with a good view of Puget Sound (in between other buildings of course). This property is very close to all major shopping, dining, etct in DT Seattle. The Market is three blocks down the street (tough neighborhood, so be aware on your walk).Parking is brutal, but it is brutal everyplace downtown. Valet is the only option and is 27 a night. We used the Valet due to convenience. They were fast and efficient, unlike other posts have mentioned. I did call in advance to the Valet and ask if my car could be brought up. Both times it was waiting when I arrived 10 minutes later. If you don't need your car, park down by the Seattle Center (much cheaper) and take the monorail to Westlake Center. Hotel is only a few blocks from the Westlake Center. You can also park on the weekends in parking structures around the area for much cheaper, but during the business week it is a wash (five bucks less, and much more of a hassle). Again the new wing is very modern and nice. Typical 4* starwood property. Nothing wrong with the old wing, just a little more worn out and needs some TLC. Did not use room service this time, but in the past it was pretty good. No complaints.I would recommend this property.I have also noted that it is frequently bid on through priceline for 99 a night. That would be well worth it for either wing.Have fun in Seattle. We are local and love going downtown for a night here and then. Would gladly stay at the Sheraton again.

<Content>Convenient for conference attendees We stayed at the Sheraton Seattle as part of a group attending a large conference in Seattle (Fall, 2007). As many of our conference activities were at the convention center, the Sheraton's location was ideal, within easy walking distance. There were plenty of restaurants nearby for lunch and evening gatherings, and Pike Place Market was about 6 blocks away. Our room was clean, comfortable, and quiet with a partial view (between nearby buildings) of the water. The hotel itself generally was a nondescript downtown Sheraton-- not the nicest we've ever stayed in, but certainly more than adequate for our needs on this business trip.

<Content>Walked to Everything I surprised my wife and two boys, 2 1/2  1 year, with a trip to Seattle for the weekend. We flew into to seattle on a friday evening, and were all ready to relax once we arrived at the hotel. As soon as we walked in the lobby, I was relieved. The hotel far exceeded my expectations.This hotel seemed to be recently remodeled, and was perfect. Our room was a perfect size, with two double beds and room for a crib for the littlest one. We were about six blocks from Pikes Place Market, and only a couple blocks to all the shopping my wife could handle.Hotel staff was very friendly, and attentive to our needs. After a trip out on our first day, we came back to the room to find the boy's stuffed animals placed lovingly on their beds.I booked the room on price for $112 per night, for the MLK holiday weekend. Valet parking is $35 per day.If in the area, I would stay here again in a second.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location! We stayed here over MLK Weekend and we really liked this hotel. Per other users' recommendations, we requested a room in the new tower. However, our flight was delayed and it was around 2 a.m. PST when we pulled up to the Sheraton. The gentleman working the front desk when we entered was having a very difficult time figuring out how to switch us to the new tower. Finally, he succeeded, and we went up to our room -- turned out he gave us a handicapped room, which meant having a strange bathroom with a seat in the shower and no counter space, as well as railing everywhere. It was way too late for us to have enough energy to ask for a non-handicapped room so we made do and went to sleep. Other than that, the room was quite nice -- brand new everything, including a nice flat-screen TV. Can't complain there! We did head to the original tower on a few occasions to use the gym. The hotel is very large and the pool/gym are on the top floor -- complete with beautiful views of Seattle and the Puget sound! However, for being such a large hotel, we were surprised there were only 4 treadmills. They were always in use and they had a sign on them about a 25 minute time limit when people are waiting. Not a huge deal, but definitely room for some improvement there.As mentioned by other reviewers, parking is also a problem. $35 to valet is insane. We parked at the Convention Center as it is one of the very few lots we could find in the area that allowed overnight self-parking. However, we were not lucky enough to experience the low rates as posted on the Convention Center website -- we paid around $22/day which is still a good savings from valet but by no means a bargain. I would highly recommend not renting a car if you're only going to be spending your time in Seattle proper, especially if you're staying at the Sheraton. There is a $10 Seattle Airport Shuttle that drops people off directly at the hotel which is definitely cheaper than parking!Overall, I'd definitely stay here again, just hopefully not in a handicapped room.

<Content>Great Hotel in Seattle This is a great hotel if you get a good price. The location can't be beat (unless you can get right at Pike's Market), and it's just across from Macy's and some other great stores. It's a very manageable walk to the Market and back. It's not too far uphill either way.The room was nice, the bed comfortable, and the service good.The restaurant service was a little slow, and the food was somewhat pricey. The breakfast buffet didn't look like a good deal to us, so we ordered off of the menu.We recommend this hotel and don't have any negative things to say.

<Content>Great hotel, good deals I was going to Seattle for the weekend for a quick getaway from Vancouver to do some shopping and go clubbing. I used Priceline to bid on a 4-star hotel room and managed to snag one for $99/night. What a great deal!I did some research at tripadvisor and discovered that the valet service was inconsistent and expensive, so my friends and I opted to park at the Convention Centre, which was quite close, although there are other garages around which may be a better price. We ended up spending $18 a night which apparently is a lot less than the valet (over $30).The check in was incredibly efficient, and took literally less than 1 minute.Also, I requested a room in the 'new' tower, as per the advice of many other reviews on here. The hallways were wide and fairly clean, although it seemed that room-service food sometimes sat around a long time before being cleared away. The rooms were clean and the beds were incredibly comfortable with nice thick pillows and a very nice duvet. The TV was a 36 LG LCD that did receive some channels in HD, although most were analogue SD.We also had an OK view on the 24th floor (again requested a high floor upon check in). Be aware: the food and minibar items are incredibly expensive and will cost you a lot. Also, local calls are not free and cost $1.75. The only negative was that the pool is inconveniently located in the other tower, which meant we had to trek across the lobby in our swimwear, although that was funny given the looks some guests gave us. Also, the pool had a lot of kids at it, so we avoided the hot-tub and just sat in the sauna. I guess we should have expected this, given the number of families checking in.Location wise, it is right in the middle of downtown and just off the I5, so it is very easy to locate. It is also fairly close to restaurants and next door to lots of shops.Overall, I would stay here again, as this experience was very positive and I was very impressed with the value for dollar. I recommend this hotel to anyone, but especially to those who are willing to use Priceline or are familiar with it.

<Content>Deluxe Doesn't Disappoint We stayed on the 12th floor of the Deluxe Union tower on a Saturday night in December. It was busy--everyone seemed to have our idea of shopping and seeing a show. I give the hotel credit for speedy check-in/out, and the relatively fast valet parking system, which was packed to the gills during check-out. We chose this hotel over the Red Lion on 5th Avenue, which is a great location, but is starting to show its age. This room was the same price and sounded much nicer. It was. The flat-screen TV was appreciated, as were the nice sheets and bedspread. Three chairs and the beds gave us an ample lounging area. The bathroom was immaculate, and had modern new fixtures. Compared to the older Red Lion, we found the room much smaller. Not cramped, but only just. On an excellent customer service note, I called down to Guest Services to request an extra blanket, and they apologized for not already having one in the closet, and for the delay in bringing it up (about an hour) and gave us a complimentary in-room movie! Quite impressive. Other notes--the room was quiet, with only the faintest of outside noises (some street noise, could hear the shower running next door).

<Content>Views on upper floors a hit, parking a miss Enjoyed a great local package deal with the hotel (check out their local website first for rates). Our room was located on the upper (old) tower floors and in need of updating. The room and beds (not comfortable) showed wear and looked the same as when I last stayed (90's) but the view and staff were outstanding.The hotel has a new updated tower (no high floors) and lost it's parking space-thus now only offers expensive valet parking at 35.00 +tax. The parking attendants were working hard but still have to wait outside in the cold for your car.If we choose to return, we would stay in the new tower and park the car across the street. Overall, an average stay with below average beds.

<Content>Wonderful! We checked in during a very hectic time, Black Friday. Even with the crowds around for the Gingerbread Village, shopping and Westlake tree lighting, the service was great. We really liked our room on the 24th floor. The location was ideal, especially for walking to Pike Place. We got a great deal on the room, which made up for the expensive valet parking - and street parking is pretty easy in the evening time (best bet on Saturday after 6pm, because it will be free through Sunday). We would stay here again!

<Content>Enjoyed our stay My family and I stayed at the Seatown Sheraton for some Black Friday shopping.We had 3 rooms on the 20th floor; the rooms we had were not the newly reno'd ones, but we did not mind. The carpets in the rooms and halls showed some wear, but overall the rooms, bathrooms and hallways were bright and clean and appointed nicely. As is usually the case for Sheratons, their beds are the best in the business, hands down. Our floor was very quite, as well.The lobby and common areas like the pool and fitness center were typical of this level of hotel.We did not eat at any of the restaurants.The best part of the hotel is definately the location. It is right beside some good shops and restaurants and is just a short (pleasant) stroll to Fishermans and Pioneer.We were pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of the valet's. We had read a lot of complaints about the valet service, but we got very good, prompt service whenever we needed our cars pulled. This was considering that everyone seems to check in and out at exactly the same time!!! As is mentioned in other posts, if you don't want your car valet'd you can park across the street at the convention centre for a cheaper price..........We used Starwood Hotel points for our rooms so I don't know what the typical rate for the rooms would be, but I would definately pay ~ $100-120 per night for these rooms; probably more if I was assured one of the new reno'd rooms.

<Content>Nice stay, Horrible Valet Parking! Stayed here for some holiday shopping. Got a great deal with a Macy's gift card included. The valet parking was awful. We had a hard time getting off the freeway to the hotel. We then learned it was the valet parking drop off. When we went to get our car the next day at check out it was over a half hour wait. We need to have a member of our party to the eastside in half an hour. We had to take a taxi there  then come back for our car. When we came back we were told 25 minutes  it was actually 45.

<Content>Great Seattle location Everything great at this downtown hotel. Parking a problem. Read other reviews where hotel parking was $35 overnite. Parked one block away at Convention Center for $18.Short 6 block walk to Pike Place Market. Don't miss it!Excellent dinner at the hotel's Daily Grill!Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Less than stellar Rooms were old and tired. Lots of street noise as well as a street drummer from 9-10:30 every night. Food was so so. Construction on the hotel was happening during my stay and the had me in a room that was too close to the ongoing work.

<Content>Great location The Sheraton has the perfect location for attending a show at the conference centre -- it's right behind the hotel. I expected more from our room; it was nice but not four star deluxe. We weren't allowed to self park (too crowded) so had no choice but to valet park which I felt was expensive at $35. Self park is bad enough at $28 but it's close to the going rate for downtown hotels. The great Priceline deal we got made it all worthwhile.

<Content>Good location, nice hotel I managed to get a renovated room which was very nice. It was clean and nicely furnished. They do charge for internet access which was a bit cheesy but seems to be par for the course at more expensive hotels.The hotel has a nice location downtown with easy access to whatever you need downtown. This is a non-smoking hotel which is different from most Sheratons as I understand. One guest who was next to me as I was checking in was rather livid when she learned this.The concierge desk on the first floor is helpful. There is a book with menus for the surrounding restaurants and a phone to make reservations on your own. This was convenient as the concierge seemed to be pretty busy most of the evening.The breakfast in the hotel was very good and if you want to shell out the money, its worth it.No complaints, this is a very nice hotel. I am dinging down one star for the lack of free internet access.

<Content>Great hotel, awesome location I don't usually like to stay at the big hotel chains, but I tried Priceline for the first time and got this hotel for $100/night. Front desk gave us one of the new Tower Rooms without asking and they were really quite nice. WiFi is not free - I think it is about $10 a day, but they have a few computers on the main floor by the elevator along with a printer. It was actually very convenient.Location is great - close enough to the I-5, really easy access to any of the trendy Seattle neighbourhoods. Shopping, Pike Place, etc. is also walkable.If you are there over the weekend instead of the Valet parking, simply park it yourself across the street in the parkade - it is less than $10 a day, versus the $30 the Hotel apparently charges. And they park it there anyway. Note - we did leave it overnight for a day during the week and the garage charged $30.Good option - really nice staff - super clean. Would stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel Got it through hotwire for like USD 100. Decided to try my luck and ask for a new tower room, high floor, room with a view and late check out. Except for the late checkout got every thing ( i did get checkout till 2 pm). Amazing location. Amazing staff, very very cheerful and helpful. Great new room, some how the bell captain wasn't very helpful had to lug my own luggage to my room, found that very disconcerting. But apart form that amazing stay. You could never get a better location than this. Will stay again.

<Content>Excellent all around, but hallway noise Booked on priceline. My polite requests for a king bed and an upper floor in the new tower were met. Room was new and very clean. This is a big hotel with a huge lobby and always lots of people around. Bed was good, but the family staying next door was commonly in the hall yelling and this was very easy to hear in our room. Location is perfect. We parked in the parkade across the street, as suggested by someone, which cost $17 for a Friday evening to Sunday morning stay. However, we were told that the rate at this parkade was changing and would be more in line with regular Seattle rates (e.g., $30+ per day).

<Content>Old School toiletries I rate the Seattle Sheraton somewhere between 3 and 3.5 stars based on 3 critiques. But first, the pros:*I made this booking on Hotwire, and got a fabulous rate (~$120 for a Fri. and Sat. in late Oct. This is a smashing deal considering you're right smack dab in the heart of Seattle. If you're a tourist and hate to drive, you can be dropped off by taxi and not need a car for the rest of your trip (you can walk to everything in the downtown core, and at any given moment, there are several thousand taxis swarming around the place).*The staff were perfectly adequate, and actually quite pleasant.*We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, the Daily Grill. As at most hotel restaurants, they'll stick it to you with inflated prices. However, the continental breakfast buffet @ $11.95 was a good deal. It might sound gross, but if you fill up on oatmeal and smoked salmon, you can probably skip lunch and splurge on dinner!Now, those 3 criticisms, one of them admittedly incredibly petty:*My mom and I had to schlepp our own bags up to our (smoking) room. This is one of Seattle's largest hotels, especially after they renovated and built a 2nd tower. You're telling me that they don't have enough bell staff, especially the Friday night before a UW home game? Even if you're short-staffed, you tell the guests to check in and that their luggage will catch up to them eventually. You don't blithely look in the other direction and let the guests awkwardly corral their own bags. Boo. Minus stars. *The first room we were assigned reeked of smoke. I know, I know--the whole property is non-smoking; they can't help it if a few jerks--err, I mean, die-hard smokers--flaunt the rules and stink up the place. Anyway, we asked for a new room and were moved promptly.*My last complaint is really, really petty. I know Sheraton is a Starwood chain, and I fondly remember staying at a W a few years ago and ransacking their Aveda toiletries. (I mean, I practically absconded with my weight in tiny Aveda bottles.) So, imagine my puzzlement to discover Vaseline-brand body lotion in the bathroom! (The Rusk shampoo and conditioner was nice, but still--I love Aveda.)So, to summarize, if you can get a screaming good deal on Hotwire or wherever, by all means book/stay at the Seattle Sheraton. I highly recommend it--if you can't get a better rate at the Westin or Hyatt. Otherwise, it's a perfectly adequate venue.

<Content>Great Location, Expensive Extras The location of the Sheraton Seattle is exemplary. Seattle Center (Space Needle), Pikes Place Market, the Waterfront, Capitol Hill and Museums are all within easy walking distance, and a bus to Bellevue is easy to come by. We even took a cab to a restaurant in Ballard and it wasn't very expensive. The rooms are nice, clean, average size. I was a bit disappointed in the tub, which was tiny (I'm 6'2 and like to have a relaxing bath when I travel), but definitely serviceable. The main down-side of the hotel is that everything costs extra, from wi-fi (how can hotels still charge for this?) to toll-free calls (I called my 1-800 number to call my home voice-mail and it ended up costing me $2.00), and the parking, which is exorbitant ($35 for valet, $28 for self-park). My advice would be to not even bring a car into downtown Seattle. Street parking is pretty difficult at all times. The concierge was very knowledgeable and friendly. The fitness center, pool and jacuzzi on the 35th floor of the old tower was nice, although the pool seem over-chlorinated. The view from up there is great. Walking around downtown I saw a few BBs that might have been a more distinctive stay, but the Sheraton did us well. We paid $142/night via Priceline.com.

<Content>Park across the street - smell the glove! Park across the street, $6 for 24hrs on weekends, $35+ at the hotel. Check-in was efficient, mechanically so, but painless. Stayed in the old tower 10th floor. Nize size rooms with adequate bath. Quiet, comfy bed. However, room smelled like wet-dog a bit. The tub also had long black hair stuck to it (gross). Location is perfect for that part of the city , close to all. I would stay there again at deal rates but would probably ask for new tower to hopefully avoid odor which was not offensive enough to change rooms but a little yucky!

<Content>Not Trustworthy Valet I stayed at the Shearaton in downtown seattle. And had my vehicle parked by the valet when we arrived which is pricey at 35 dollars. They were very pushy at hurring and parking the car and when we did trust them with my vehicle it had numerous items STOLEN out of it. When I called the valet to retrive my car the next day I got in to find out they had went trough my middle consule. Took my medication and money. When I told the valet manager about this he told me it was my fault for trusting his employees.And there was nothing he could do about it.

<Content>Thoroughly enjoyed my stay I spent 4 nights here on business in July. I stayed in the new tower and the room was outstanding. The bed was very comfortable. Conference facilities were excellent. The downtown location is terrific for walking. Only problem was that the fitness facilities are very limited. They opened at 5:30 am and there was already a lineup for the machines. 4 treadmills, a couple of ellipticals and some resistance machines - not enough for the size of the hotel.

<Content>Sleepless in Seattle = Myth My stay at the Sheraton Seattle couldn't have been better. I stayed on the 27th floor of the old tower. I was tempted at check-in to ask for the new tower as TripAdvisor posts recommended. At the last moment though, I thought I would rough it. Truth be told - the old - I hate that descriptive - the classic tower was very nice. I got a great view of downtown in a room that was very comfortable and quiet. I liked how large the space was. Big bathroom, big bedroom, big dresser, ample closet space, etc. The room temperature stayed nice and I never touched the thermostat. The staff at the Sheraton were great too. At check-in, a tall, beautiful woman, zoomed me through the process - did not change her high level of service when she realized I was a hotwire customer and offered me upgrades without prompting. I was in the door of the hotel and into my room in 5-7 minutes. On my last day at the hotel - I hit the restaurant for a breakfast buffet. The sausage and potatoes with eggs were fantastic. They had an ample supply of fresh fruit and healthy alternatives - that I appreciated but avoided. I was overly hungry from eating sushi the night before - and feeling less than full. I highly recommend the Sheraton Seattle. What a great visit. When and if I go back - it'll be the Sheraton for sure. Other cool thing - the Grayline Boeing tour loads at none other than the Sheraton. Very Convenient.

I always got decent size rooms (better on the starwood preferred floor) and found the rooms to be very clean and the service to be good. I got great rates with our corporate rate so with this rate I will not stay anywhere else in Seattle. Notice that the valet parking is very expansive ($32)

<Content>parking is exorbitant Absolutely don't stay at this hotel if you're driving. Parking is valet-only which is $35/night, but they double-charge you w/an additional $35/night for parking. If you don't mind paying $70/night (excluding gratuities) for parking go ahead.

<Content>disappointed,concerned We were surprised and disappointed at the condition of our room.We would have asked to be placed in another room if our schedule would have permitted. There were several stains on the carpet and furniture.The bathtub had moldy/dirty caulking,the mattress cover was not fitted and rolled up all night to the point of being very uncomfortable.Our morning paper never arrived.Now for our concerned part.We had booked reservations at Sheraton in Hawaii prior to this experience.Now we are having second thoughts of making this trip to just discover a repeat performance of disappointment.Thankyou for the opportunity to review and we hope this message will help you do what is necessary to avoid anymore of the same.Room 513,9/29/07

<Content>Nice Club Level Amenities We spent three days here in September in a Club Level room. The room was well appointed, with great views on the 33rd floor. We especially enjoyed the complementary continental breakfast and evening hors d' ouevres in their club room on the 32nd floor. The breakfast selections were fresh and well presented, and the evening hors d'ouevres (with optional beverage service) were a nice treat after a long day of sightseeing. The club lounge was a sedate aiery where we could relax and reflect above the hustle of the city at street level. The public areas on the ground levels were well kept, and nice looking. Fresh orchids were found throughout the lobby and lounges. The desk staff were especially professional and accommodating, and did a nice job of making us feel welcomed to their property. The rooftop pool, sauna and health center while adequate was busy busy busy, so if you really have to take a dip when you vacation, be prepared to do it with a big audience.

<Content>Crowded with Conventions, but otherwise OK I often stay in Seattle for business and the last time I stayed at this hotel, I found it very good for the price. This time the hotel was more expensive and I found it just average. Here are my thoughts:POSITIVES:- Location: This place has a great location within walking distance of most parts of downtown Seatlle and has many, many shops and restaurants within two blocks. Also very near Pikes Place Market. - Room: I stayed in the brand new Union Tower, on the 23rd floor. The room was very nicely appointed. My room had a king bed, a huge desk, a buffet table under the TV and a cosy chair. It had nice built in storage areas and a built-in closet all made out of rich,and warmly-stained hardwood. It had a 27 inch Plasma TV hung nicely on the wall. The bathroom was very nice, marble floors and countertops, a spacious shower with decent water pressure and a cool, built-in 3-way mirror.- Bed: This is almost always a given in Starwood hotels, but the bed was very luxurious in terms of the linens and the feel of the mattress. NEUTRALS:- Internet in room was $9.95, however, it was for 25 full hours rather than through noon the next day like in most hotels.- The service was simply average. The person at check-in was not particularly friendly, but wasn't rude . . .just doing her job un-enthausiastically. The bathroom in my room didn't have a blowdryer or the assortment of bath products you normal expect when I checked it. However, I called housekeeping and they sent someone immediately and offered to credit me some Starwood points for my inconvienence. But worst of all, they missed a wake-up call to me on the last day of my trip. Fortunately, I had set the alarm in the room as a back-up. - View: The view from my room was of the side of the building accross the street. The way the hotel is angeled the whole side of the hotel that I was staying on has nothing to see out the window. - Lobby: Very large and since I last stayed there they have attempted to make it more cozy. The lobby is oddly layed out and its quite a walk from the hotel elevators in order to exit the lobby. Its also funny that the first time I stayed here I didn't even know that the hotel had a bar in the far end of the lobby because its hidden around a corner. NEGATIVES:- Very Crowded: I stayed for three days and the hotel must have had three or for different conventions going at the same time. This made the hotel lobby, the check-in, check-out line, the elevators and the entry to the hotel SUPER CROWDED, extremely loud and hectic. - Construction: A lot of construction going on in the lobby and in one of the entryways (which was often closed because of the construction) added to the crowdedness and overall hectic feeling of the hotel in general. - Parking: I hate parking at downtown hotels as it is ALWAYS a RIP-OFF. You pull up at the hotel and the take your car at the valet and NEVER TELL YOU how much its going to be to park. I was in a hurry to check-in and forgot to askthe person at the front desk. When I received my bill, I was shocked to find out that parking was $35.00/night. That is absurd in light of the fact that you could park a block away for less than $10/night. I guess I learned a lesson the hard way. SUMMARY:In light of the foregoing, I feel the price ($236/night) was not worth this hotel and $35 was certqain high for parking. Nevertheless, I would stay there again if I could find it for under $150 and I would park in the lot accross the street.

<Content>Great location... Loved the location of this hotel but got a handicap room with no tub having to travel with 2 young children can be a bit challenging. Requested for 2 beds but was told not available. Otherwise a beautiful hotel. At check in, they did mention I was a priceline customer.

<Content>Classic Splurge Typically we wouldn't stay someplace like this since it would be too pricey. But we got a godd deal on this and absolutely loved the what the Sheraton had to offer! Service was the kind you expect at a business hotel, but the decor is very swanky. The rooms are large and though ours only looked out on other skyscraper hotels, we loved the location! It's minutes from the waterfront and Pike's Place Market. Plus, surprisingly, their valet parking service was a few dollars cheaper than any of the public parking available around the city. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in the heart of downtown Seattle.

<Content>Very Nice Post-Cruise Stay! I booked this hotel for us months in advance via Priceline for $105 for a Friday night, post-cruise stay. They had to pry us off the Vision of the Seas, after a fantastac Alaskan cruise, at around 10:00 on a Friday morning. By the time we got our luggage, and got a cab ($10 cab ride from Pier 66), we arrived at the Sheraton around 11:00 in the morning, expecting to check our bags and check in later in the day. No! We approached the check-in desk, telling them we knew we were way too early, and she said let me see what I can do...uh...room, ready...now! We were thrilled! After the fast and friendly check-in, we headed for the elevators, lugging our 4 bags that were only minorly troublesome. We had been cruise-spoiled for a week, so we were fine handling our own luggage. When we got to the elevator, there was a rather insistent bell-hop who really wanted to put our luggage on our cart. We appreciated it, but reassured him that we were okay. Somehow, because of this, we all managed to miss an elevator, and the bell-hop (Henry) expressed great concern that the General Manager was on one of those elevators. Afraid that we'd gotten him in trouble somehow, we let him take our bags (which we should've done to begin with), he led us to our room and we tipped accordingly. He gave us a card for when we needed him again.The room didn't look like it was one of the renovated ones, but it was perfectly fine, with a great view of the city. We ended up spending very little time in our room, as we were out for lunch through about 4 am the next day, due to friends in Seattle. :) Leaving Saturday morning for the airport, we were happy to see Henry quickly come up after our phone call, to retrieve our bags and get us a cab. He was so sweet and friendly, telling us that there had just been another guest in the hotel with the same unusual last name. We were sorry to say goodbye to the Sheraton after such a whirlwind stay, and would not hesitate to go back. The location is perfect! And Henry...we thank you for your professional perfectionism and friendliness....what a great end to a fabulous vacation!

<Content>Lovely hotel--but... We enjoyed the lovely big room which had almost no street noise, however, our room had a door to an adjoining room with a 2-3 inch gap under it. Our neighbors for two nights seemed to be having a major party,starting at 2:00 AM. The first night, we did not call security, as things quieted down after 1/2 hour. The second night we called security,which led to toning down of the noise for 20 minutes, but had to call again before people who were obviously totally drunk(or worse) left. The hotel stole our thunder the next morning by calling us to say that $50.00 would be taken off our bill--not really enough to compensate for two nights of disturbed sleep . We wondered whether security was really on top of things. Breakfast was a problem as there seemed to be many tours using the one facility, which had a long waiting time. The hostess told us that the restaurant was not owned by the hotel. We did have a lovely, peaceful breakfast around the corner at the Hilton.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Location This is a great hotel in a fantastic location. Having read the reviews on trip advisor I emailed the hotel before my arrival to ask for a room in the new block and I got it. The room was very nice, big and very modern with a lovely bathroom. The lobby was massive and on check in and check out had no wait at all. We ate in the restaurant on one evening and although quiet pricey it was lovely. The bar is also very nice and serves a wide range of drinks and cocktails. The best thing going for this hotel in my opinion in its location. Whether you are going to shop or do the whole sightseeing thing the location is fantastic. It is right in the middle of everything. We really enjoyed our visit to Seattle and this was only hightened by our stay in the Sheraton. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in the midst of everything Seattle! I spent four nights there and really enjoyed my stay -- except for the dreadful woman in the next room who stayed up late every night to call colleagues in a differnet time zone (Europe?) and slammed her door repeatedly. Food was great (if you like burgers try their Angus Burger - OMG it was amazing), very professional staff, clean and comfortable rooms. I stayed on Club Level (which is in the old tower and it was really nice) and got free breakfast and hors d'oeuvres; both were VERY tasty. The breakfast included larges bowls of fresh in-season fruit and had the best raspberries I've ever eaten. Great high-end pastries, too. The housekeeping staff was gracious and very helpful. Had a room on the top floor with views of the mountains and water. Located in the middle of everything and I had a chance to walk all over the place, including just a few blocks to the Pike Place Market. Shopped at Macy's and had great service there. Would definitely return. Also, the bed was amazing! Took the tour to Boeing and it left from the hotel. So convenient.

<Content>The Good, The Bad and The Ugly The GoodAs far as I could tell the construction work is now over and they have certainly made a great job of the reception and lobby area. Despite the constant throng of arrivals and departures the team out front do a great job marshalling the press of traffic, parking and retrieving cars, getting cabs and keeping everything moving smoothly.The location for enjoying Seattle鈥檚 shopping and dining is unsurpassed.Check in was friendly and efficient and the only mention of Priceline was, 鈥淵our room has been pre-paid by Priceline.鈥?We really liked our room, it was a decent size for a city centre, the d茅cor was minimalist cool without sacrificing functionality and everywhere was clean. The bathroom was a good size, well fitted, supplied with nice toiletries and again clean.The BadWe were lucky, arriving in a comparative lull, and only waited while one person was checked in in front of us. Throughout our four night stay, every evening as we went out to dinner there was a snake of people wound to and fro round the lobby, wearily waiting in line to check in. Some of them looked as if they had been there for hours! Possibly connected to the above the extensive seating area of to one side of the lobby was always packed with people trying to sleep on the couches and armchairs with luggage strewn around them; it was reminiscent of a refugee clearing centre.You pay for the great team working out front. Valet parking is now an eye watering $35 per day.The UglyWe went into the bar one evening for a pre-dinner cocktail. Two mojitos and two vodka tonics plus a small tip came to an incredible $50.

<Content>What a treat! We were fortunate to stay in the new tower that had only been open for 3 months. The room was gorgeous, the bathroom immaculate. The bed was very comfortable. A great time. It is close to everything. We had room service, a little pricy (of course) but quickly delivered and very good. We did think it odd that the Daily Grill quit serving the main breakfast menu at 10:30am; other than that, we had a great time. We will be sure to stay there our next visit to Seattle.

<Content>Good Location This hotel is in an ideal location for Seattle offering perfect views. The rooms and service are cookie-cutter Sherarton. The lobby has been redone and is gorgeous.I've stayed at this hotel many times and it's not bad. I guess it just kind of boderlines on borrrrrrrrring. There are certainly no surprises. Also, Sheraton will nickel and dime you for everything (internet, phone, mini-bar, parking, etc) . The rooms are in need of a re-do. The bedding and furnishings are starting to not look fresh.However Seattle has many unique boutique-like hotels that offer a lot more charm and charisma than this place. So check out your options before you settle on a big box like this.

<Content>Great stay in Seattle We stayed in a twin room in the Union tower at the end of August 07. Location was fantastic, just up the street from my conference at the Westin. Short stroll to Pike Place markets, close to the monorail, surrounded by great shopping!The room was quite spacious, comfy beds, nice bathroom. I was impressed with the free internet in the business lounge too.All in all, a great stay!

<Content>Excellent Location, Decent Rate, Crappy Room Service Stayed at the Sheraton Labor Day long weekend and was pleased all-around. The location is EXCELLENT! I usually stay at the Vintage Park when visiting, but for some reason, the rates were pretty high and I found a very good rate of $169/night through their website for a room in the Union Tower. For that price, I was pretty satisfied. I usually dread sleeping away from home as I own a Presidential Plaza bed, but I gotta say the beds at this hotel were pretty damn comfortable and cozy! Only complaint I had was the room service food - OVERPRICED and GROSS! Also, the valet parking was $35/night, but I knew that before booking, so I decided to fly down instead and drive back up with some friends. The service is satisfactory, but not at all bad. If I could get the same rate of $169/night the next time, I will definitely be returning here on my next visit!

<Content>Sheraton - very nice We stayed in the Union Street tower (new standard king room) and found it to be very nice!! We are usually Westin or W people, but decided to check out one of the new rooms here. Love the new design and the subway tiles in the bathroom. Bed and linens were on par with the Westin Heavenly Bed. I slept like a baby and am extremely particular about bedding. Curtains made the room completely dark - perfect for sleeping in!It was quite posh, and I would consider this hotel over the Westin aand W Seattle next time we are in town. And yup, parking is expensive everywhere in SEA. that's just how it is!

<Content>Wonderful time at the Sheraton We stayed at the Sheraton on Auguest 20, 2007. We were pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. I had emailed the hotel earlier requesting a King room in the new tower. I didn't really expect to receive what I'd asked for, afterall I only payed $125 with Priceline. However, upon checkin I was pleasantly suprised to have been assigned a King room in the new tower. The room was lovely. Very comfy bed, lovely view, and a nicer TV than I have at home :), . Bathroom was bright, clean, and comfortable. Location was very convenient. Concierge was most helpful in helping us find out which city bus to take to get to King Street Station. Will not hesitate to stay here again!

<Content>Seattle Sheraton We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton 8/16-19. We requested rooms in Union Tower months before we arrived, but were told they were none available when we got there. The rooms we did receive were clean and comfortable.What an excellant location! You could walk to Pike's Market and the waterfront within minutes, the monorail for the Space Needle is right down the street and it's also in the free zone for buses.The hotel has a pool , sauna and whirlpool, but beware! If you're looking to relax after a long day in the city, in the whirlpool, count on small children! Even thought the rules posted on the wall prohibit children from using it, there is no enforcement! ( I had the unpleasant experience of a child sneezing while in the whirlpool and using the water as his tissue, right in front of his father!)All in all, the Sheraton is a great hotel to base out of to see such a wonderful city!

<Content>lots of hidden charges I travel to Seattle and have stayed in a number of hotels there -- notably the Edgewater and Monaco. I stayed at the Sheraton this time primarily due to an internet price offer and the 4 star rating of the hotel. But it's clear that the Sheraton sheds all it's normal charges in order to make the rm price look cheap -- while my quote was abt $200 a night -- in fact I paid abt $300 a night. On a two night stay that's a big surprise. Valet parking is $35 a night, and their non-valet parking is $28 a night and a block away. To be fair, Seattle parking in general is way overpriced -- comparable to NYC (where at least it seems merited). Internet is $9.95 per day. If you send packages ahead (as many of us business travelers do) you are charged on a sliding scale based on weight -- that added another $60 to my bill. AND they lost the most important box of the lot. While they made some visible efforts to look for the box -- the fact is that Fedex showed the box signed for, and their own system had logged it in -- but they could not locate. I've had better help at Motel 6 -- and they don't charge anything for internet or boxes. The room was a perfectly normal hotel room; ditto with bathroom -- in short, there is nothing here that special, they are overpriced, and service in this case was subpar. Also they seem to cater to conventions, large groups, so there are long waits for everything (elevator, bell boy, cashier, etc., and there usually 20 - 30 people out front smoking and blocking doorways. Everyone has their hand out (not unusual at a hotel like this, but even more blatant here -- and without much of a smile or effort) When I have to open my trunk and pack my bags in the car, it seems impertinent to be expecting a tip just for bringing the car up. Will not repeat this hotel, and frankly hurt my impression of Sheraton overall as well. I have had much more consistent and better visits at Hiltons lately. One small note -- there is a great Vietnamese restaurant around the corner called Bambuza -- don't miss it! It was the highlight of this trip.

<Content>Disappointed with the Sheraton This was our third time staying at the Sheraton Hotel in Downtown Seattle and it was our third time being disappointed. Our first two trips to this hotel were both Christmas trips (2005 and 2006) and our last trip was during the last week of August 2007. The first year that we booked this hotel we called them directly (after booking our room with an on-line service) to comfirm that they were the same hotel that hosts the famous Ginger Bread House competition for the local chefs. Once we arrived to the hotel, we were very surprised to find that the hotel was not only in shambles from being under construction, but that they had moved the Ginger Bread houses to another location entirely (an imprortant fact that they forgot to mention when we were calling to confirm that the Ginger Bread houses were indeed going to be there). On our second Christmas trip we decided to try bidding on a hotel with priceline.com. We were a little disappointed when we found out that the hotel that accepted our bid was the Sheraton. We decided that we would look on the bright side though and give the hotel a second chance. We thought that there was no way that the hotel could still be under construction, but once again we were greeted with the confusion and mess of construction. The place was a mess and the Ginger Bread Houses were still no where to be found.This last trip (and it will be the last) we tried hotwire.com for the first time. And once again we ended up with the Sheraton. I again decided that I would be optimistic and hope for the best. I can say that I was happy to see that the lobby and new tower were no longer a construction zone, but I was still very disappointed with the floor that we stayed on and the room we were given. The table outside of the elevator had garbage on it and the hallway had bits of garbage all throughout that no one bothered to clean up during our stay. The room that they gave us looked out into the alley and there was scaffolding hanging outside of our window all three days that we were there. Not at all what I would expect from a four star hotel. I think that their star rating should be brought down a notch or two. Needless to say, I don't think that we will be staying at the Sharaton any time soon.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Sheraton Stayed here for 2 nights. It was expensive (parking is $35/night) but it's only 5 blocks from Pike Place and roughly a 20 min walk to the Harbor Steps. You can catch the monorail a block from the hotel if you want to visit the Seattle Center. We stayed in the tower facing Union St which has been remodeled. We had a plasma in our king room and the furniture is contemporary. Really liked the room and had no problems with noise. If you don't mind spending a little, it's a great stay. Just make sure you stay in the remodeled section. And the concierge was extremely helpful. I believe the lobby has free wireless, but it may cost to connect in the room. The only reason I give a 4/5 stars is the ridiculous parking cost. I know it's a major city and it's downtown but I still think it's too high.

<Content>Nice Hotel I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past. This was my first stay in the new tower. The rooms in the new tower are definitely nicer than the original tower. They are brighter with a fresher look. The original tower rooms are fine as well, they just aren't as nice. The pool area offers a great view of the city. Also, the location of the hotel is perfect - although parking is too expensive - more than any other hotel I've stayed at in Seattle.My only complaints, and they are minor, are that there is still some construction going on in the lobby area, so it has a slight feel of a construction zone with many areas hidden behind black curtains. It is minor though, my guess is they will be finished by the end of September. Also, the restaurant and lounge area is a bit disconnected from the hotel. I tend to prefer hotels with lobby bars, and this one does not.

<Content>they're right, excellent location Unfortunately we only had a short stay in Seattle around a cruise to Alaska, but I am so glad we did decide to extend our trip to include at least some time in the city. The hotel was wonderful. All staff was very helpful, beds were comfortable, clean rooms and most important, the location was very convenient. It is located in an area with several other hotels, but I especially liked being on Pike, within a couple blocks of the market.The price was the same or a little less than other hotels in the area. It was a great value.

<Content>Will never go back It was the worse stay we had ever had at a hotel. They were no help to us at all. The concierge had no idea about the sites in the city, how to get there and espically how to get back. After finding a concierge who knew where Fishermans Terminal was she advised taking a cab, which we did. Not knowing that the cabs did not return to that area. We were stuck there for over one hour after calling the hotel for assistance and having them tell use there was nothing they could do. Saw other guests who were also upset.

<Content>Great Location! Stayed 3 nights at the hotel with my extended family. The location was great - we were able to easily walk to Pike's Market, the monorail to Seattle Center, and even to Safeco Field. We were in the new tower, and the room was immaculate, including an LCD, attached to the wall, TV (we didn't watch it much, but it had a really impressive picture). Health club was OK, as was the indoor pool, whose best recommendation was that it was on the 35th floor.The construction mentioned in earlier reviews is basically done, other than some areas near the restaurant (which we never used).There was a small problem in our room (one of the 2 beds was not stable), but the hotel fixed it promptly and took $20 off our bill for the trouble.I would definitely recommend the hotel.

<Content>Great Stay a very comfortable stay. great views. yes parking across the street was 26 / day but we factored that into our costs. We got a fair deal on priceline. Pros - comfortable beds, pillows, rooms, and great lobby, 4 star hotel, top location. Cons - pool and hot tub look a little dated for such a great hotel. It is odd they haven't done a reno there. The pool at our 89 dollar best western in federal way was nicer and had a clean feel to it. Sheraton needs to clean this area up.Only other negative was we couldn't really get the room quite as cool as we would have like at night but that seems to be a problem in some high rises with central air. Hotel bar charged me 3.50 for a ginger ale to take out to the room for my ill wife (I had told them). Thanks for that. All in all a top hotel. We stayed on the not reno'd tower but it seemed very acceptable.

<Content>Great room, great location Booked a room through Priceline at about half the regular price. Pulled into the valet area expecting to pay a pretty penny to park my vehicle, and I was not disappointed. $35 for valet is pretty excessive, but what else are ya gonna do, I guess.Check-in and other staff interactions were smooth and painless - they even switched our room from 2 doubles to a king without any protest, which isn't always a given when you've used Priceline. Room was spacious and spotless, with a good view of the harbor and the surrounding office buildings.Great location downtown - about six blocks from Pike Place market, right in the retail core, a couple of blocks from the monorail station. A great base for exploring. I fully recommend this hotel, even if it is a bit nondescript and corporate.

<Content>Great hotel and location I was a little sceptical booking this hotel after reading other reviews, but was pleasantly surprised after my stay at the Sheraton. The construction is over and the hotel is lovely. The room we had was in the newly refurbished tower and the rooms were large and immaculate. The beds were also very comfortable. My brother booked a suite and their room was incredible with a view of the water. The staff was extremely helpful as well. Definitely worth considering for your next visit to Seattle.

<Content>Location, Location, Location Great downtown location. We were in the older tower, but the room was fine - clean, large, perfect for the three of us. Easy walk to the monorail, pike market, buses. Would stay at this location again.

<Content>Great stay at the Sheraton I was a bit wary about staying at the Seattle Sheraton after reading multiple reviews about construction in the lobby and bad service, etc but since my friend  I had Pricelined it and won the bid of $120 per night, we had no choice.And much to our delight EVERYTHING was very good! The location is perfect: Pike Place Market is 10 min walk away, shopping, food, buses are all within reach. We had no issues with the front desk, everyone was very helpful and friendly. It IS a very busy hotel but very spacious lobby that made nothing seem confining. Our room was in the Pike Street tower which I believe is actually the older side which has not been renovated but we couldn't really tell the difference. The room was highly comfy, clean and quiet. There is a pool  jacuzzi on the 35th floor and use of internet (although only 3 stations, so you may have to wait your turn) on the 2nd floor Business Ctr which we used during our 5 day stay.I would definitely stay at the Seattle Sheraton again.

<Content>Great Rooms, Bad Service I gave the Sheraton Seattle a 4-star rating primarily because we stayed in the Union Tower and the rooms were brand new, modern, clean, and very comfortable. If you're looking for a clean, comfortable room in a great location, this hotel will be perfect for you. We got the room for about $210/night (including taxes), which seemed to be the going rate on the travel Web sites and the SPG Web site in July and August 2007. The hotel is right on Pike Street and a close walk to everything Seattle has to offer. The room and location get the 4-star rating, but there were several problems with the hotel service.On the downside, the hotel is used by massive numbers of convention-goers, which makes the front desk VERY unorganized. We arrived at 1 p.m. Pacific time after a LONG day of travel from the East coast, and they would not let us check in despite my SPG Gold membership. We had to keep checking back at the front desk every 30 minutes or so, only to be told different things by different staff members. It was clear that there were rooms available, but that housekeeping just had not communicated that they were ready. It took over 3 hours to check in, and the front desk wasn't very helpful throughout the process. Other guests had problems checking in, too. The lobby was full of tired, grumpy people. There seemed to be no order to who got the available rooms first. Other negatives include a broken shower that was not fixed for a whole day (we had to call back when we returned in the evening), long hold times on the phone, and the pool and hot tub were closed for a day and a half without signs saying when they would re-open. Also, we did not receive a wake up call we had scheduled, so be sure to set 2 alarms if you stay here. Free WiFi is only available in the lobby -- not in the rooms. The gym is in the Pike St. Tower, so you have to go through the lobby to get to it if you are in the Union Tower.This Starwood property does not do free upgrades to the Club Level. I honestly don't think that having an SPG membership means anything to this hotel, because there were no obvious benefits.In summary, the rooms and location are great and you would probably like this hotel for a short stay. If you are staying for more than a few days, you might find better service and amenities at a different hotel.

<Content>Fabulous hotel at a great location and a great price We just got back from staying at Sheraton downtown Seattle. It is on 6th Ave and Pike, so it is extremely convenient to everywhere. You can walk down to Pike within 10 minutes. The rooms were spacious. Hotel staff was very friendly. To our pleasant surprise, they not only comp internet charges at the rooms, they also have a business center where you can access the internet AND use their printers for free. We were very impressed with that. They had a summer special and we were able to get the weekend rates for $145 a night. That's a good deal for this hotel. We'll definitely go back.

<Content>Excellent choice RECOMMENDED (with caveat) - 2 towers, one new/old. Get one in the new where I stayed. Large room, modern decoration, comfortable, great LCD TV, fast internet, work area, bedding great, quiet, fast elevators. Bathroom super, well illuminated, nice amenties. Everything in excellent working order. The other tower will ultimately be renovated, but it's a bit threadbare. Gym is on top floor of old tower, bit cramped. Hotel location is central. Checkin fast with no flaws. Overall a Super Property!

<Content>Sheraton needed a make over I just got back from Seattle and I thought the Sheraton was just average. The room needed a make over. The carpet was stained in certain spots, the shower head needed to be replaced(you could hurt yourself with that thing) and the A/C didn't work very well. It turns out we were in one of the older rooms. The other tower had the newer updated rooms.The staff however was extremely helpful and nice. The location was awesome(just a few blocks from Pike's Market) and the rooms were very quiet. We really enjoyed the bar in the restaurant on the lower level and the drink prices were reasonable.I would stay here again but I would request a room in the new tower.

<Content>I would pass on this hotel--not representative of Starwood. Stay here only if you like lots of noise, crowds, have fairly low standards, and get a deal. My experience here was much different than at other Starwood hotels. This is a huge convention hotel and hotel for people leaving on cruises. I suspect they pay very little for their rooms. Buses of people constantly arrived while we were there for a 3 night stay. Parking was $35 a night. If I did it again, I would look for a small boutique hotel. I booked 2 rooms via Starwood's website several weeks in advance of my stay. I am Starwood Gold. I called the hotel in advance and asked for 2 rooms connecting or adjacent on the club level, in a quiet area. I did not get a deal. When checking in, there were probably 100 people in line--no joke. Fortunately there was a separate line for Gold and Platinum members. We were told we could not have adjacent rooms--they were on separate floors. We were not offered an upgrade. The rooms were not ready at 2:45 p.m. (Gold gets early check-in). Fortunately a big tip to a porter got us adjacent rooms on the club level, but in a VERY noisy area--right next to the club lounge and elevators that ding nonstop and feature a recorded lady's voice You are on the 32nd floor. Parking was $35 a night. The workout room is dreary and in bad need of updating. The pool area looks a bit dated and sad. It's a big pool with enough chlorine to make you itch for weeks. You can't call for your car in advance--you wait at the valet for a long time before they will pull it around. I will pass next time!

<Content>Great Hotel and Location This hotel was about a five minute walk from Pike's Market. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. The fitness center is adequate and gives a great view while on the treadmill. Parking was pretty steep at 35 bucks a night. We spent two nights and with parking it cost us a little over 400 dollars. The business center offers free computer services and printing. This was helpful in getting directions from MapQuest.

<Content>Perfect Stay at Sheraton Seattle No Construction - Awesome Location We had a late arrival on July 19, 2007. We booked two rooms, the hotel once we arrived was sold out so our rooms were not adjacent nor in the new tower as requested through Sheraton. We arrived by limo from the airport as we had 3 adults and 2 children travelling. (limo was $45 -great deal at the airport and you don't have to wait in the taxi line!) Although they could not put me in the new tower like I had requested our room was great and overlooked the street right in front of the hotel. The pool on the top floor was great and had an amazing panaramic view of the entire city. The service was wonderful and we had an early check out at 6am on the 21st and the staff was very pleasant and were right there to help with all of our bags. I would without a doubt stay here again. All of the construction has been completed and the lobby is large and beautiful. The bar/restaurant has a great happy hour as well. The Sheraton Seattle made our short stay in Seattle perfect with its quick walk to Pike's Market where once there you can also catch a bus down to tour the Mariner's stadium - It's a great city!

<Content>nice room but hard bed We stayed here for a conference and it was very convenient to the convention center, plus all the tourist attractions in Seattle. The staff were generally gracious (the late-night clerk could have been a little nicer), but definitely ask for a room in the new tower b/c the beds in the old tower are HARD! My colleague got lucky and managed to get a club level room on the 34th floor with a much softer bed, better robes, and a jacuzzi tub for the same price as what I was paying for my regular tub and hard-as-a-rock bed. This was especially interesting since I am a Starwood preferred guest (and she is not), and we checked in at the same time, yet she gets the upgrade instead of me? Umm, okaaay.....Also there was a screw-up at the front desk and they gave some random dude the key to my friend's room! The guy walked into her room while she was enjoying her Jacuzzi tub, and when she yelled Hello? he said sorry and left, but then continued to call the room looking for his wife! When we called the desk they apologized and brought new keys, but they didn't even offer a discount or anything. As women travelling alone we of course thought this was totally inexcusable, even though the manager explained that my friend's room had been originally booked as part of a suite, and the man who 'intruded' was the husband of the woman in the adjoining room. (Needless to say we will be writing to Sheraton-there is just no excuse good enough for that!) Also, don't pay for club-level, the extra price is not worth the 'lounge' and the pool is kinda yucky. If/when I go back to Seattle I will stay at the Mayflower--we visited a friend there and the ambience was way cooler than the sort of generic feel of the Sheraton, plus the martini bar is FANTASTIC. The Sheraton wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't spectacular.

<Content>Friendly staff and very comfortable beds I stayed in this hotel as part of a tour that included 6 other hotel down to the coast of California. I enjoyed this hotel the most. It has a great location for tourists. It is close to the market place and many other attractions. I found the front desk staff very accommodating (thanks, Christopher) and the rest of the hotel staff very friendly. I loved the beds--very comfortable. Breakfast was included as part of our tour and I enjoyed it very much. Everything that I would want was included in the buffet and the fruit was very fresh. (hi to Morgan--wait staff). The hotel was also very bright and clean looking with fresh flowers in the lobby area. If you go to Seattle, try to make a short side trip out to the Boeing Aircraft factory. All of us loved this tour. We found that the people in Seattle, as well as in Portland, were always very willing to help out tourists with directions and suggestions.

<Content>Great experience! I did not encounter any rude employees or a lack of service while I stayed at the Sheraton on 6th Avenue. The prices are quite reasonable compared to other 4-star hotels in downtown Seattle. I did a price search and found that they were the same no matter what website I used. I booked through Sheraton directly. You might be able to find lower prices with AAA if you book in advance. My fiance and I arrived at 10:30am and the Sheraton let us check in early. The room service was very good. We had a large corner room with a view of Union Street all the way down to Pike's Market, which was a 5-10 minute walk. The beds and sheets were very soft and comfortable. You can find plenty of shopping within a block of the hotel and there is a very good crepe place a block away at the convention center. The only things I could complain about were the water pressure in the shower, the lack of a fan in the bathroom, and expensive parking (but all parking is expensive in Seattle) ...otherwise our stay was wonderful and I will return the next time I am in Seattle.

<Content>Average The Hotel is in a great location. Staying on the club floor we got an awesome continental breakfast. The fruit selection was outstanding. I dont know how people can say the Health Club was nice. It is in need of a serious upgrade. Treadmills were in very bad need of repair. (all of them)...The room was very small. If 8-10 people were in there, forget about working out. The jacuzzi was hot and did not work well if at all. The pool was average at best.Rooms were nothing special.The location (awesome) and the breakfast (awesome) raised this hotels grade to average to me. There is no way I would pay anything over 200 a night to stay here. There are many other quality hotels in all aspects for near that price.

<Content>Nice hotel but felt nickled and dimed We booked this hotel on hotwire and the rate was still high...$200 per night. When we arrived at the hotel, my husband and I requested a king bed. We were asked to pay an additional $20 per night to have a king bed in the new tower. In addition, parking is $35 per night. So, just expect that you will pay a bit more than anticipated if you have special requests.On the good side, we ordered room service the first night which was delicious and delivered in 10 minutes! Room service is expensive, but that is always the case in hotels.Our room in the new tower was lovely and spacious with a great view of the city. We enjoyed the complimentary starbucks coffee. However, they put out snacks to tempt you to spend more.After the first night, I woke up early due to time zone changes. I decided to go to the gym. It does not open until 5:30 AM and there is no place to have coffee until then. The elevator won't allow you to access the 35th floor (location of pool/gym) until 5:30, so the front desk staff suggested I take the stairs. Well, the door on the 35th floor was locked so I almost got locked in the stairwell. The exercise room is good, but small. The pool was fine, but full of children. The jacuzzi was warm but the jets were broken.We loved the location of the hotel and enjoyed the convenient shoppoing and dining. Try the Tap...restaurant across the street. The food was reasonably priced, delcious, and they offered 160 types of beer on tap (not my thing, but interesting).We would stay at the Sheraton again, but would have open eyes about the expenses.

<Content>nice, no greeting at check-in Got a deal thru hotwire although found out later that may be able to get an even better deal naming price thru priceline.Nice clean hotel. At checkin, no one at the front, no doorman, no bellman. we carried all our luggage ourselves, nobody around to help us with bags and we had a bunch of bags.rented a car for one day but charged for parking for two. called front desk twice to have one night parking taken off our bill.Good location, shopping and pike market all walking distance. newly renovated, flat screen tv, expensive parking $35 per night. decent pool for an indoor pool. Everything good except for lack of greeting and assistance upon arrival.

<Content>Stay here if you can get a deal We got a rate of $99 on Priceline. They put us in a hospitality suite with two roll-aways! On the other hand, the cots were comfortable and the room, strange as it looked, was bigger than a regular room. The front desk is disorganized, the lobby is outrageously crowded and bustling with groups.Theres a nice view from the pool/health club. The location is good for touring. Theres no place for breakfast. I would never consider staying here for rack rate but for a priceline stay, it's fine.

<Content>Decent visit Requested new tower and upgrade (being Starwood Preferred member) - got neither - maybe call the day before? Anyway room was fine EXCEPT - ice maker on my floor didn't work my entire visit (I complained twice) - coffee pot in my room didn't work - they took it away but didn't bring a new one or hand towels until I reminded them a second time. also the malfunctioning coffee pot spilt over onto below the sink and they did not clean that. YOu have to go to the lobby for free internet. Business center was full at midnight when I went to print my boarding pass - I had to BEG at the desk to have them print it. Lots of construction still going on. But I do still love Seattle!

<Content>Lovely Hotel; Great Customer Service The hotel is in a great location to see the sights of downtown Seattle. The customer service is excellent, and the concierges were very helpful in showing us where to go and what to do. The hotel may seem a bit pricey, but you can't expect any less in a downtown setting. We didn't take our meals there, as there were so many exciting places to eat outside the hotel. Most of the places to see where either within walking distance, or within close distance of some type of local transportation. We loved our room, but hated being charged for Internet service. Our view from the room was spectacular - downtown, with a glimpse of the water. Wonderful! We would stay here again, with pleasure.

<Content>Service Sucked! I go to Seattle at least 4 or 5 times a year for pleasure. I generally stay at the Sheraton because I liked the rooms and service it is right downtown convenient for walking. I was very disappointed in the service since they remodeled their lobby. The best service was from the Valets. That was it. The front desk employees were rude, whether it was on the phone or in person, didn't matter. They just had this attitude that was not appreciated! It started on the phone when I tried to get a room through Sheraton. The rate fluctuated with each phone call and I made 3 of them. I ended up calling and talking to the manager about the reservations department. First I was told that there was a military rate, then I was told that there wasn't one, then that there was only a military rate for the actual active military man and not the spouse. Which doesn't make sense. I gave up. didn't book a room, set my mind that I wouldn't try to stay there again. There are plenty of nice hotels in Seattle. We decided to priceline, got the rate we were looking for without the military discount and ended up at the Sheraton anyways!!! Fate!! Still the service sucked! Rude staff and to top it off you have to pay for the Wi Fi!!! I won't make any effort to stay at the Sheraton again!!

<Content>great hotel  We usually stay @ the Seattle Westin, but since I had a convention from June 30-July 2 @ the Sheraton, we stayed here. They put us in the new upgraded Union Street tower on the 24th floor. Very, very nice room. Plasma tv, nice amenities, bathrobe. I think they upgraded us to that room because we are Starwood Preferred Guests. There was a free bottle of water for me 2 of the 3 mornings. The food in the restaurant, The Grill, was good. It is located approximately 5-6 blocks to Pike Street Market, 2 blocks to Nordstrom and maybe 4 blocks to Macy's. It's 2 blocks to Pacific Place and 4 blocks to Westlake Mall. We walked towards the alley by Pike Street Sunday evening hoping to find somewhere to eat dinner, we stumbled on this wonderful restaurant called the PINK DOOR. I highly recommend it. It's in the alley and overlooks the Puget Sound.Anyway, the check-in and check-out was great, we had to valet park ($35 per day) because the regular lot was full ($28/day).Still like the Westin for it's waterfront views better.

<Content>Sheraton good  My husband  I just got back from Seattle on Thursday June 28, 2007. We booked our room at the Sheraton through Priceline and I thoroughly read all reviews on this site. I was a little concerned by the mixed reviews. I completely understand them now. Construction did not interfere with the hotel experience at all. The lobby is beautiful. Our first night we were given a room in the Union Tower. The room was wonderful. Super comfortable bed. Everything was bright, clean,  new. Flat screen TV, lovely bathroom. Everything was great. I couldn't understand the poor reviews. The next morning we had a message that they needed to move our room due to plumbing maintenance. We said, no problem (we were hoping to get a king size bed) Well, they switched our room to the other tower and when I asked the girl if the rooms were as nice she replied, They have a different decor, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.So up we went, to discover why this hotel has poor ratings. The beds were virtually the same, but the carpet was dirty, the walls were mucky, the bathroom was old and dark, and the furniture was so big it took up the whole room. We walked right back down and requested a room in the first tower we were in, they were accomodating. If you stay at this hotel, make sure you have the new tower! The location is great, the staff is friendly, and if you get a nice room it is a wonderful place to stay.

<Content>Terrific Experience The Shearton-Seattle was just perfect. The location cannot be beaten, the furnishings were luxurious/comfortable and the room was very large. I particularly enjoyed the spa-like bath, huge LCD television and the room was only 1-month old (new tower). I did not eat in any of the hotel's restaurants. It was a wonderful, 5-star experience!

<Content>Great Stay Sheraton Seattle Hotel, Excellent StayDate: June 27, 2007Reviewer: Trip Advisor Member, Las Vegas, NVWe just spent 4 nights at the Sheraton from June 21-25 and have to say that our stay was excellent. I had read some prior reviews about the remodeling that was going on but decided to book our stay anyway. Upon arriving at the hotel we found the lobby has been completed and is just magnificent. We were very impressed as we entered the lobby and somewhat impressed with our rooms. It is a perfect location to get around the points of interest in Seattle and easy access to ride the city bus system. We attended a Mariner's game and had no problem taking a city bus right to the stadium at no charge, there was a $1.25 charge per person on the way back. It is very easy to travel within the city through this system, if you don't mind. We felt very safe at all times. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and courteous at all times. P.F. Changs and Cheesecake Factory are around the corner plus many more restaurants, a shopping mall is also within a block or two. Not to forget, Starbucks is across the street, plus your coffee in the room is also Starbucks brand. There is a shuttle that you can take at the airport that drops you off and picks you up right in front of the hotel for a $17.00 roundtrup fee, the airport is approximately 10-12 miles from the hotel, call the hotel and ask for the information. The location of this hotel makes a difference, it is centrally located and the convention center is a block away. All in all, my wife and I had a GREAT time in Seattle and part of that was because we stayed at the Seattle Sheraton. A place that we will definitely stay on our future trips to Seattle.

<Content>Nice, but overpriced and poor service The renovations are now complete, or at least we didn't see or hear any construction. We stayed at this same hotel a few years ago. The hotel is nice, and even nicer now. However, the service is still poor. We paid a lot for our room ($200/per night). We choose the hotel because of the location. It took over 45 minutes to get our bags from the door to our room(and then we called to find out where they were). The room still had trash from the previous guest. Parking is $35/per day.We felt for the price we paid, the service could be better and the staff more friendly. A little extra could go a long way.

<Content>Nice, Spacias Comfortable Rooms, but NOT a 4 star The hotel was nice even though it was still under renovations. One thing I noticed right away was that the staff didn't seem happy to be there, but it was friday night and I am sure they all didnt want to be there. I walked into my room not knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly suprised. The room was very spacias and the views were nice. The bed was comfortable. I was in RM 1901 - Traditional King. I didnt feel that this hotel was a 4 star, but it was stilla very good 3 - 3.5 star hotel but they charge a 4 star price. I would have not stayed here if I didnt get a steal of a deal on Hotwire. It was close to a lot of shopping and all the stores downtown and only a few blocks from Pike's Public Market. The only incident I had was at 11:15 friday night. I hadnt had anything to eat all night long so I called down to room service and was on hold for 15 minutes listening to music and the same hotel recording. I called down to the front desk and explained the issue and they just connected me to the same line - so after being on hold for another 10 minutes - I just went outside and found some dinner.

<Content>Sheraton Seattle - Good Location, Dirty Toilet!! My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Seattle a few weeks ago. The lobby was not open (still under renovation, I guess) when we arrived, so the reception and concierge desks were shoved into a crowded hallway. Check in went smoothly, and we were given a room promptly even though we arrived a few hours before the official check-in time. When we got to our room, we went to use the bathroom and the toilet was FILTHY! I will spare you the details, but clearly it had not been cleaned after the last guest. Housekeeping did respond quickly and cleaned the entire bathroom, but that negative first impression still lingers. The rest of the room was OK - typical decor, above average bed, decent view of the city from our 20th floor room.  The major strength of the Sheraton Seattle is its location. It is basically across the street from the convention center - perfect it you are attending a conference. It is only a few blocks from Pike Place Market and lots of restaurants and shops. There is a restaurant and a bar at the hotel, but I didn't visit either. No place to get a quick cup of coffee at the Sheraton though. I tried to get take out coffee from the restaurant, but the request seemed to confuse everyone. It took about 20 minutes for them to figure out how to sell me some coffee in a paper cup. I couldn't believe it was so difficult to get a cup of coffee in SEATTLE! Luckily there are coffee shops on every corner once you leave the hotel. Overall, the Sheraton Seattle was OK. Its location made up for its weaknesses, but that is only because I was attending a conference and appreciated the proximity to the convention center. If I were going back to Seattle just for vacation, I would probably try a different hotel.

<Content>No complaints here! As many others have reported, we stayed at the Sheraton one night prior to taking a cruise. We had only positive experiences there. Check in was speedy, the bed was comfy, lunch the next day was good, and the employees were pleasant and helpful. We walked to Pikes Market with no problem, and if we ever return to Seattle we would most likely stay at the Sheraton again.

<Content>A good 3 Star place I would consider a return to the Sheraton.Great location , 5 blocks from pier 66 , lots of nearby shopping, lots of things to do . It was just real busy on the inside  out. There was culinary traning , renovations , a lot of interior and exterior traffic which interferred with dining quality and overall general services and help. Good room , good mini bar. Overall I think it failed to live to Sheraton standards , a good 3 star place , 4 stars?? Nope.

<Content>Average, but good for deal received through priceline... My husband and I work for a luxury hotel company so, our viewpoint is a bit different than other customers. Regardless, there are a few good things to mention. We enjoyed the location of the hotel, no doubt. The beds were very comfortable and if you stay on the 30th floor or above, the views are spectacular. We had a very low rate of $89/night through Priceline with an upgrade to club for only $30/night. However, we were a little disappointed with the selection and quality of food served in the club. Our main concern with this property was that the staff overall was not very pleasant. It seemed that we were a nuisance to most we came in contact with and timeliness of service was an issue as well. Of course, the valet was pricey, but we read the reviews ahead of time and worked it into our budget. This Sheraton is definitely not a 4-star hotel and we had looked forward to a high level of service due to the fact that we work for a 5-star hotel ourselves. So, we would recommend this property if you are happy with 3-star hotels or lower.

<Content>Excellent location in Seattle The Sheraton is going through some construction phase but as an update to the previous reviews, the entrance into the lobby is now open as well as the driveway to the entrance. However, the lobby is still block off on the left hand-side which make the lobby a bit restrictive in size. I don't linger in the lobby so that is not a problem for me.The check-in was quick and friendly. By my SPG status I was upgraded to a corner room on the executive level on the 33rd floor. The room is above average size with the usual Sheraton yellow and buff stripes wallpaper. The room has been kept pretty clean although there are sign of date on parts of the room. There are obvious upgrades that has been done to the room to buff up its 80's image but there are still a few pieces of the furnitures that shows its age. The Sweet Sleeper bed is comfortable and on the soft side. The bed covers and accessories are a level above the usual standard Sheratons'. The mini-safe in the closet is the largest in-room safe that I have seen. It is almost as big as the mini-bar and can fit my laptop and still have plenty of space left for my SLR camera and lenses.The bathroom is actually larger than the usual Sheraton but due to the layout, it feels as if it is the same size. The Pantene bath products are omnipresent here as they are in other Sheraton. Nothing exceptional here.The location of the Sheraton is excellent, close to the Convention Center and major malls or tourist sites are just a few blocks from either way.This is one of the nicer Sheraton that I have stayed in and at the top of my list of Sheraton hotels in North America.

<Content>Avoid until construction/refurbishment is completed I stayed at the Sheraton in Seattle one day before a cruise. The hotel is in a perfect location to walk to many downtown restaurants and shops. The hotel is under construction so the entrance is poorly marked on the side side of the hotel. The taxi driver could not pull up to the curb due to construction materials in the street. There was no one there to help me with my luggage and no ramp up from the street. Only after I made it to the lobby was I offered help with the luggage. Too late! Check in was a breeze, less than 5 minutes. There are two sets of elevators depending on which floor you are on and I was directed to the wrong set. Fortunately I caught the error before getting on. The room was clean and standard but outdated in shades of buff and yellow. There is no gift/sundry shop due to the construction and the restaurant/bar is just a cordoned off section of the lobby.I might try the Seattle Sheraton after the construction and refurbishment is finished but not before then. Even thought I secured what I felt was a very reasonable rate on Hotwire I do not feel the hotel was worth the price.

<Content>Nice, but not a 4 star My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to our Alaskan cruise out of Seattle.I booked this hotel on Hotwire for 129 per night, which I think is a good deal for the $$. Pro: Great location, just a few easy blocks straight down the street to Pikes Market, the monorail to the Space Needle, etc. Big bed, comfortable, good coffee. Quiet overall.Con: Small disorganized lobby (under renovation), slow elevators, dated room furniture and decor.Overall, a very nice place, and I have no major complaints. However, I wouldn't rate it a four star, nor would I be willing to pay much more for the room than what I paid.

<Content>Great stay! Stayed here for 1 night pre-cruise and had a generally nice stay. When we arrived we were informed that the hotel was overbooked (because the new tower isn't finished yet and is behind schedule). We were given the option to stay in a regular room or a parlor suite. We choose the parlor suite which is basically a suite minus the bedroom. The just added two twin beds to the living space. It sounds bad but the beds were extremely comfortable and it was nice to have all the space you associate with a suite.The staff was great, however the lobby restaurant was so understaffed we gave up waiting to be seated after 20 minutes. So we didn't get a chance to used the $10.00 voucher we received for choosing the parlor suite room.

<Content>A Great Stay My daughter and I (the mom) stayed at the Sheraton Seattle for two nights, Fri./Sat. in May. I was able to book a week-end special, so it ended up being cheaper than staying at the Best Western near the Space Needle. We couldn't have asked for a nicer room. It was actually a handicap room, and it was spacious. We had two over-sized double beds, which were more like queens, a huge bathroom, and a large picture window overlooking downtown. The room was located in a little alcove, so there was no noise from people walking by in the hallway. The Sheraton is located in the heart of the city, within walking distance of everything. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely stay at the Sheraton Seattle again.

<Content>Stay in Bellevue instead I write this review as a leisure traveller. This hotel has a superb location and the beds are super comfortable but that's about it.The valet parking is $35.00 enough said. The rooms are not modern in any way starting with a 10 year old television. What strikes me is the odd lay-out of the bathroom. Open the door and you walk straight into a wall( you better be sober!), step out of the shower and your foot will be in the toilet. This is not a quiet hotel.The noise from showers around you will not allow you to fallback to sleep if you are awaken. The noise from doors closing can be compared to how a door would close after a 6 hour arguementwith your girlfriend or boyfriend, the foundations literallly shake.I don't know why someone would want to stay at this hotel for the prices charged, if you're going to spend the money stay at the Hyatt or Westin . If you're on a budget stay in Bellevue, the hotels are everybit as nice or better. I would recommend the Bellevue Athletic Club, the Hyatt or the Westin. Take a taxi or public transport into town and you'll save enough money for a steak dinner at Ruth Chris.

<Content>Nice Despite the Renovations I stayed at this hotel with my husband and two small children, from May 2nd through May 5th. We were there so my husband could attend a meeting at the Convention Center. I really have no complaints. Our room was big and clean. We were on the 19th floor and had no problems with noise. They are still renovating so the lobby is small. However, it is clean and still very nice looking. Based on previous reviews I had some concern about staying at this hotel. I had no reason to worry. If you can enjoy a hotel without a large lobby, then don't worry about the renovations.What I want to convey to others considering this hotel is don't worry about choosing this hotel. It is nice and clean and is in a great location with tons of places to eat all around. I don't understand why a previous reviewer said there were few options. The shopping in the area is amazing. I lived in San Francisco for ten years so I know what a great downtown area is like and this is a great location. Easy walk to Pikes Market. My only suggestion to those traveling with small children, if you want a small fridge, the hotel charges $30 a day. I rented a fridge and microwave and bedrails from a local baby equipment rental company. The company delivers the equipment to the hotel and picks it up when you are finished. I believe they charged $30 per week for the fridge.

<Content>Had my Wedding Here My wife and I got married here back on Labor day September 4, 2006.I will just start by a couple quick comments on the wedding then get back to the rooms and facilities.Our wedding was perfect and we couldn't have asked for anything better. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the ballrooms were gorgeous.Back to the review, The construction at that point didn't effect us for the most part. The front of the hotel was being worked on but the main entrance was still open. I was in a standard room the first night. Nothing special really except for the great Sheraton beds which are to die for. The pool was average as well and the gym was nothing to write home about. I would expect a little more from the Sheraton chain in regards to these areas. The hallways and lobby are very nice and extremely clean.The suite we stayed in on our wedding night was very outdated. Run down furniture, old time TV (with a VCR no less). It was very clean and we had the staff's full attention but they should really modernize some of the rooms, especially the suites.

<Content>Generally high marks Despite the renovations, my stay at the Seattle Sheraton was most positive. Make no mistake, this is a busy, large convention hotel, in downtown Seattle with prices to match (though comparable to those of other downtown hotels). That said, however, many positives  fit my criteria for a good stay. Clean, quiet, comfortable bed, good internet, good fitness center,  rates well on one of my measures of an upper-level facility, thick towels. Few minor annoyances, rather superficial maid service, be prepared to be on hold with the Sheraton song for at least 5 minutes if ordering room service or calling the concierge, but personnel were uniformly courteous  helpful once contact was made. Carpet had lots of mileage  room difficult to heat but they got me a space heater. Minor stuff in the scheme of things. I鈥檝e stayed here in years past  was not disappointed this time , would recommend.

<Content>Convention Hotel w/ Lots of Renovations and No Loby I stayed at the Sheraton while attending a conference across the street in the Seattle Convention Center (20-23 April). This was the conference hotel, so their rate was reasonable $209. As a Starwoods Preferred Member - Gold, I stayed on the Club floor - which allowed me access to their club room - serving continental breakfast and light food during the evening. Also, room had a nice view, television, internet and printer access and was open 24 hours. Free local and 800 phone use from the room.Hotel under major renovations currently, so the front door/lobby was missing. Adding a second tower to their facilities and moving the front door to match a driveway for drop-off. Be that as it may, they had temporary counter for check-in, concierge, bellman, etc. Check-in was slow though, as there was at first only one person at the counter, regardless of preferred member status or not. Hallways were all narrow given the temporary walls up for construction, so a queue of people waiting for check-in blocked easy access to the door and hallway leading to the concierge/etc.After check-in I had a room on the 34th floor w/ the 35th floor housing the pool, gym and meeting rooms. At night I would hear the staff moving furniture across the floor on rollers.Room was typical size, usual amenities. A larger size safe was available, which fit my laptop and other gadgets well. Bathroom was typical - no special amenities. Coffee machine serving Starbucks, mini-bar and assorted munchies available. Be careful - water bottles at $5.00/bottle. I was initially overcharged $28 for mini-bar use, when in fact, the key from the last guest was still in the fridge.Bed and bedding was nice. Two robes, towels fine, shower typical. Small desk with free internet connection available, though I was unable to connect to wi-fi, and had to use the wired connection taking me to the Sheraton website for log-in. Newspaper - Seattle Times and USA Today left at the door.Room service menu was not very appetizing, given the availability of local seafood. Not many restaurants nearby - Cheesecake Factory across the street. Other restaurants - Ruth Chris steakhouse, sushi/pan asian nearby in the Fairmont Hotel. Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant as it had the same menu as room service.Best part about the Sheraton was that it was directly across one street into the convention center - no other hotel that close. Also, plenty of security at the doors to limit traffic, as I noticed plenty of young kids and homeless panhandling in the area.Very typical convention hotel. I imagine once they open the 2nd tower the Sheraton will have a typical lobby, front entrance, drop-off area and other restaurants. No store available to offer toiletries, drinks, newspapers, etc, though I noticed behind the temporary counter they had a box of asundries available - toothpaste, brush, mouthwash, etc. Other reviews seem to indicate the need for fresh paint and new carpeting - I didn't see that in my room.Would stay here again, but may try something like the Westin or something near the waterfront area.

<Content>Nice hotel, High prices I stayed here for a conference in March 2007, and even with the special conference rate, my 2-night stay was nearly $500. The room was what you'd expect at a Sheraton. The hotel is in the middle of a major remodel, so if you really want luxury I'd pick another one (maybe the W). But in its favor, the hotel was posh and very well located.

<Content>Amazing Location/Average Room/Ridiculous Nickel/Dime Practices The Sheraton Seattle is a great place to stay in Downtown Seattle on a budget. I received this hotel through a priceline bid that was half what the hotel cost through other sites. Had I paid full retail, I would have been disappointed, but it's a fine choice. Here are the Pros/Cons:Pros:1. The location can't be beat. Awesome shopping - Nordstrom, Macy's and other great venues are within sight of the hotel. Nike Town and a great Adidas store are across the street. Great restaurants are nearby as well with a Cheesecake Factory across the street. Gameworks and a movie theater are across the street. It is right off of Pike Street and the Pike Street Market is within a few blocks of the hotel.2. The staff is very nice and very accomodating.3. I got a great rate through priceline.4. The view. I could see the water and the mountains from my room - amazing.5. People make a big deal of the remodel in their reviews. This is not an issue at all, but maybe that is because it's further along than when the early reviews were written. I didn't really notice anything.Cons:1. They nickel and dime you horribly here. They charge something like $5-$7 a box if you have them delivered to your hotel from your office from FedEx/UPS. Maybe this is common, but I've never seen this and it's kind of ridiculous.2. Parking is $36 a night! I've stayed in Chicago, San Fran and NYC and have not seen this - this is Seattle, not a top 5 sized market!3. The room/furnishings are average at best. Hopefully the remodel helps this. The rooms isn't dirty or gross - just in need of some updating and the bed pales in comparison to a lot of hotel beds I've seen. Again, not bad, but not worthy of a 4-Star hotel.If you get this through priceline, be happy - it's a great deal. If you paid retail, hopefully it works out for you.

<Content>Wait until the remodel is done It鈥檚 probably unfair to even review this hotel given that it鈥檚 undergoing a massive remodel that includes a new lobby and a second tower. Nevertheless, after staying here twice in the last three months there are some things that deserve comment. First, the good news. The staff is great and does an excellent job coping with the remodeling project that has gone on longer than eventhey are willing to admit. Also, you can鈥檛 beat the location for shopping and sightseeing, although it could be some better restaurants around because you don鈥檛 want to eat at the makeshift one in the hotel. Also, the new conference area on the second floor is first rate even if the rest of the hotel isn鈥檛, at least not yet.The bad news is that the place needs a major update, which I assume will be done once the remodel is completed. The furniture in the suites is threadbare and the electronics are, well, nostalgic with a cassette tape player, VCR, and projection TV. If I dug around a little I probably could have turned up an 8-track or a turntable. An HDTV would be nice, but why bother since there are no HD channels on the hotel鈥檚 television system. The only thing more nostalgic than the electronics is the health spa. The view is nice, but it doesn鈥檛 make up for the outdated equipment crammed into a too-small space. They could also take a second look at their prices. $7 for a Corona at a no-host reception and $25 for an eight-minute phone call to a city 175 miles away is laughable and insulting. Thank God for cell phones and near-by bars. You鈥檇 think that even a hotel manager would figure out that you could make more money selling three times as many drinks at half the price rather than pricing people right out the door.So, if you really need to stay at the Sheraton Seattle, best wait until the remodel is done. If you鈥檙e booking ahead and they tell it will be done by the time you arrive don鈥檛 believe them. Wait until it is really done. In the meantime, there are other hotels nearby including some that will make you feel right at home with $7 Corornas.

<Content>Very, very pleased with the Sheraton We just returned from a three night stay at the Seattle Sheaton and we couldn't have been happier. Thanks to previous postings, I booked our room through Priceline at an incredible $95/night. The parking was expensive at $28/night, but we felt that the cheap room made up for it. I did not have to wait in line at check-in and they gave us a room on the 30th floor with spectacular views of the city. The room was spotless and quiet. My kids loved the pool and it was very clean and never crowded. As a tourist, the location can't be beat. The main doors are on Pike Street and you are only a five block walk to the Pike Street Market. The monorail is two blocks away, and the shopping district is all around you.The construction is still going on in the lobby, but I never heard it or was inpacted by it.

<Content>Ok but not great I stayed at the Sheraton recently while attending a conference. The proximity to the Convention Center and to Pike Place Market was a plus. The hotel is currently undergoing some renovations so the lobby is small and there was construction noise downstairs - but I couldn't hear the noise from the room. The room itself was fine but smallish. For the price, I have stayed in bigger places but I guess Seattle is expensive. The staff was pleasant but not over friendly.

<Content>Over Priced and Under Special The hotel is under construction and the lobby is almost gone! The front desk can only accommodate 2-3 staff members so be prepared for a LONG wait checking in/out or to simply ask a question. While my spouse checked in, I went to ask the concierge for directions to a nearby restaurant that we had selected for dinner. There was no concierge at 8 P.M. on a Wednesday night. I then turned to the bellman who was very rude. Smokers line the walkway into the hotel so there is a smoke fog all the time.The room was ho-hum sand-colored Sheraton with no extras or frills. It had the minimum of niceties with a small predictable bathroom.We attended a reception in the Presidental Suite and the upholstery was so worn it was in shreds!!!Our room was not clean and the linens were not changed after it was requested daily. There were coffee grounds on the bathroom floor that were never cleaned the entire stay. There was an unidentifiedsomething on the edge of the toliet. I hate to think...We travel a lot and I would not stay here again.

<Content>Ho Hum...another convention hotel My husband consistently waits until one month prior to book a hotel for his conferences. Hence we always get stuck with the 'fourth' choice at the 'conference rate'. There is a reason this Sheraton is 'fourth choice'. It lacks any kind of panache, pizazz or pleasantry. This is your straight up vanilla cookie cutter conference hotel. Rooms are boring, carpets are stained, tubs are old, phones still connected to cords in your room, tv doesn't swivel, amenities are lackluster at best (no Bliss or Aveda treats here), dings on all the furnishings, scuff marks on the walls and closet doors, ancient, and I do mean ancient thermostat controls which respond slower than a cat breathing on you. No lobby whatsoever to speak of, in fact, it's downright depressing when you walk in. I totally agree with the other reviewer on this. Now if you've never been to a W, or a Ritz, or another good upscale chain, you'll think this place just swell. Those of you expecting a little more - head elsewhere! There is not one, and I repeat not one impressive thing here. Upon check in - very late at night - we were told there were no King beds left, even though we had requested one, with a crib. So instead we were given a room with double beds, and they brought a crib up. Now 2 double beds and crib makes the room feel completely claustrophic and tiny. Not good. The front desk gent did give us the kindness of putting us on a much higher floor. The 30th floor, which is not concierge level, but is a 'preferred floor'. I really hope these rooms are not the 'renovated versions'. That said, the relatively good points include - Location - the location is absolutely ideal for shopping buffs. And good dining abounds in the area. Service is prompt and the concierge is really nice. The beds are ok if you like puffy, but I miss my firm matress. Very hot water is plentiful and the pressure is great! The best is housekeeping will come until 4:30pm, so there is no pressure to get out of the room by 11am. This is a really, really big plus when traveling with an infant. Paid conference rate of $206, I think it's actually worth $175 p/night, but that's just me.

<Content>location, location, location After reading previous reviews, I was worried when my Priceline bid ($100) was accepted for the Sheraton. I was pleasantly surprised. We were there on the weekend and there was no construction noise at all. The room was lovely. It had obviously been recently remodeled and had fluffy down duvets, towers of pillows, and a clean and sparkling bathroom. The TV could have used some help but we weren't in Seattle to watch TV. The location is superb. It is a block from Nordstroms, 2 blocks form Macy's, a block from the 5th Ave. Theatre, just up the hill from the Pike Market, and right next to the Convention Centre. The staff was friendly and helpful. Hint: use the valet parking. The traffic downtown is not for the faint of heart. The valet charges are absurb but anywhere you park in downtown Seattle is pricey.

<Content>This property has went downhill. I've stayed at the Sheraton Seattle numerous times on business over the last 3 years. I used to really enjoy it, but it has progressively gone down hill in my opinion. Unfortunately,. my last stay will likely be my last, despite the location, which is closest to my office. This last visit the hotel was packed, so there was a huge wait to check in, even late at night, and with my SPG status. The room I received was one of the larger suites, but it was really just a huge waste of space. The layout of the furniture was spartan at best. Most disturbingly, the room reeked of mildew and the linens seemed old and tired, long overdue for replacement. This property is undergoing an expansion, so construction noise was also a problem. After 1 night, the mildew was aggravating my allergies, so i asked to be switched to a different room. The room I was moved to was tiny, cramped and dark, and the view looked out on to a lower rooftop, where at 6 am, a construction crew convened. At $279 a night, I expect more. I won't be staying at this Sheraton again anytime soon.

<Content>Pleasant but hotel in transition The Seattle Sheraton is an old hotel (as far as hotels go), and a major renovation of the public areas and construction of a new a tower are underway with completion scheduled for May, 2007. In the meantime, hotel public areas are virtually nonexistent except for the mezzanine level on which meeting rooms are located. The carpeting in this expansive area, by the way, is a series of white rectangles on a dark background, and it was busy enough in appearance to almost make me dizzy! Reception is a temporary desk crammed into the corner of what was probably just a hallway leading to a side exit (temporarily the main entrance). If the lack of a grand stylish entrance bothers you, pick another hotel. Unfortunately, the Sheraton (Starwood) website does not disclose this information, so one's arrival at the hotel can be quite jarring and disappointing. Service, however, is very cordial especially under difficult physical conditions.The rooms seem more updated and well maintained. My partner and I stayed on the 32nd floor (club level) and had access to a nice lounge that provided evening wine and munchies as well as a large continental breakfast in the morning. Complimentary wireless internet access was available in the lounge and access in the room was via an ethernet link. The Sheraton bed is as comfortable as any with a fluffy duvet and silky smooth sheets. A very nice, though small, pool is located on the 35th floor; however, it was long enough to do laps. Next to the pool is a well equipped fitness room with up-to-date cardiovascular equipment. The only problem here is a lot of equipment crammed into a relatively small space. It was quite dramatic using treadmill while overlooking downtown Seattle from 35 floors up!I wouldn't consider dining at the Sheraton until construction is complete. A breakfast and dinner buffet are available in the Cirrus Lounge on the 35th floor, but it's clear this is being offered as a stopgap measure. There are many choices for restaurants at all hours very close to the hotel. (Parenthetically, I do remember coming to the Sheraton in the early 80's when one of Seattle's finest restaurants was located in the hotel. Perhaps that will happen again.)In summary, staying at the Sheraton isn't unpleasant. It just feels functional and not especially elegant, and this is all due to the hotel being in transition. Like a restaurant that has just changed chefs, judgement should be deferred until a later time.

<Content>Horrible Hotel! Be careful with this hotel. They will cheat you. When I called to make a reservation for a government conference I was told the hotel was completely sold out. I requested to be put on a waiting list and they took my name. A few days later a co-worker called and was able to book a room and received the government rate. I called the hotel and asked why I wasn't called. They gave me the run around and said an opening came up. I asked if an an opening came up, why didn't they call me since I was on the waiting list. They agreed to give me a room (hmmm...thought they were sold out) but said they couldn't accomodate all the nights of my stay. But they would not give me the government rate even though they gave it to my co-worker who called AFTER I did. There is major construction going on at this hotel. In addition, the hotel is not very nice. They don't have a business center, gift shop, or wireless internet. They only have one place to eat and the prices are outrageous for very average food. Whatever you do, don't stay at this hotel. There are many other nice hotels who will accomodate their guests. The Seattle Sheraton has no sense of customer service. Avoid this hotel!

<Content>Stay here! This hotel has everything - tremendous staff, great location, spotless rooms and a fantastic pool. When I booked the trip, I got a great promotional rate on Hotwire since it was a slow preholiday weekend. Due to massive power outages, the hotel was suddenly booked to capacity. The staff handled the crowds with speed and courtesy. There were tons of happy kids enjoying the amazing pool. There is construction taking place, but you'd never know it. Room service dinner was fine,although a little slow due to the crowds. The hotel is so centrally located, finding a restaurant is easy. It's a five minute walk to the Public Market and shopping is closer than that. The views of the city were great from the room, and the beds were very comfortable.Previous reviewers complained about the price of parking, but $25 is average overnight in the area. I can't think of a negative thing to say about this hotel!

<Content>Average Hotel-Nice Location We had reserved our room for five days, however we checked out after the first night. Let me first state the good things about this hotel. It has an incredible view of the city and the location can't be beat. These two things were not enough to make us stay in our room which had definitely seen better days. The bed actually sagged in the middle, not terribly, but enough to indicate that it was old and should be replaced. The carpets appeared worn as did everything else. There was a huge cigarette burn mark on the bathroom counter. Hopefully they will renovate when the new tower is finished.

<Content>Nice location, lovely room with a view The good - While requesting a view in Seattle can be fruitless - I didn't even realize I had a view of the bay until the day after I checked in, which was when the clouds lifted enough to see the ferry cruising through the grey water - it's also rewarding when the sun comes out. The room itself was warm (a first in my experience with hotel rooms, which tend toward the chilly side), and cozily decorated in sandy tones, with a very appealing bureau instead of the typical TV cabinet with bottom drawers. The room was clean and nicely turned out when we arrived, comfortable bathroom, closet, etc. The hotel employees I spoke to were all very pleasant. The hotel's in an excellent location for tourism - the Pike Street Market is a very easy walk down the street, and taxis are readily available nearby. There are three upscale malls of various sizes in the immediate area, with two large movie theatres, Borders, Barnes  Noble, Williams Sonoma, Anne Taylor, the original Nordstrom's, Nordstrom Rack, and I would say every other high-end retailer on the planet is represented. While much of downtown is hilly, Pike Street is very walkable, and not at all steep. Grayline Tours has a desk in the lobby, and picks up at the hotel for tours and for airport shuttles, which is handy. The bad - The hotel pool, which is inside on the top floor, was ill lit and rather chilly. Obviously heated, but not very well. The jacuzzi was very nice, however. The soda machine on my floor and on the floor above me were both broken, and the ones which did work refused to function if you used change rather than bills. The rather pleasant little porch area on the corner entrance was closed Sunday night, as part of the construction going on at the hotel, forcing everyone to enter and exit the hotel through the badly designed main entrance. This is essentially a driveway where the taxis, limos and cars are constantly arriving and leaving, so it's a bit hazardous to navigate, especially since there's no pedestrian walk that extends down to the public sidewalk; you just have to hop off the apron near the hotel doors and hope an SUV isn't about to swing around the corner, which is pretty much blind since there's a construction overhang. The lobby area was dark and uninviting. I'm guessing the Chihuly sculpture I kept reading about was removed during the construction, for safekeeping.Summary: overall, a nice hotel but with a few bad spots. I'd be a little concerned about the entrance issue if I was elderly, or travelling with someone elderly or shaky/weak on their feet, as getting from the door to the sidewalk is clearly a bit dangerous.

<Content>We were very pleases with the Sheraton Hotel and Towers. My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton for two nights prior to our Alaska cruise. We booked it through Hotwire. Our stay was more than we expected. A great room. An upgrade to the 29th floor and very close to Pikes Market.It was only a $10 cab ride to get to the pier. We purchased a roundtrip ticket on the Airporter to the Sheraton. Then took a cab to and from the pier. It saved about $15, which isn't alot, but it was very convenient and the bus drivers are much more friendly than the cabbies.All-in-all, if you wnat to be close to the downtown action, this is a great hotel to pick. It was definently a 4-star for us.

<Content>Nice Room, Great Location We stayed at the Sheraton for two nights after our Alaskan cruise. We found a nice big room, with a comfortable bed, new linens, very clean and modern bathroom. No noise from the construction. Maybe because it was on a weekend, but we found the hotel very quiet for its size and the crowd that always seemed to be coming and going in the lobby.Good location for shopping. Easy access to highways. Easy walk from Pike's market. Would stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel, Great location Stayed one night at Sheraton while on vacation in Washington. Booked on Hotwire and got a great deal! The staff was very friendly. We arrived around noon and our room was not ready, but they checked us in and asked that we return in about an hour. We left our bags with the bellhop and walked a few blocks to Pike Place Market. When we returned our room was ready and very nice. The location is awesome with restaurants and shopping within blocks and the waterfront is nearby. Had the brunch buffet the next morning which was way overpriced, but tasty. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Place is a dump! This place is a dump. The place was old and dirty, more like a 2 star hotel with dirty sheets and carpet. The place is right out of a bad seventies movie, everything about it is old and worn. I would avoid this place and wait till the new tower is build. The location is ok but the hotel like a motel 6 at best.

<Content>a seattle treasure We stayed at the Sheraton Seattle for 1 night on a northwest road trip, we had a wonderful experience with the staff and the location couldnt have been better. Arrived at check in time, 3 pm, and got a great room on the 31st floor with a breathtaking view of downtown and surrounding areas, room was HUGE with a big dining table by the window, and big comfortale beds, HUGE bathroom, and very clean, probaly one of the best Sheratons ive ever stayed in, if you come to Seattle this is the place to stay, plus request a room on a higher floor, the views are worth it!! and despite all the construction, noise was low.

<Content>Not bad even considering all the construction This Sheraton was overall nice. The furinture and furnishings in the rooms seemed to be new. The carpet in the room was definately worn out. Overall the hotel was nice. They are expanding the hotel so there was a lot of construction going on. If you are a late riser you may want to consider staying somewhere else due to all of the noise.The location of the hotel was perfect...right next to the convention center, shopping and lots of restaurants and just a short distance to Pike Place Market.

<Content>Great Hotel The hotel was under renovation when I visited, so I had to use a side door, but when my cab arrived there were doormen on the sidewalk to direct me to the right place. It's apparent Sheraton has taken steps to minimize inconvenience during the construction. The construction wasn't a problem when I got to my room though. It was on a high floor as I requested and was located well away from the construction. I only wish the Club Lounge was open all day like those at Ritz-Carlton. I tend to sleep late and always miss out on the continental breakfast!The 35th floor pool and jacuzzi had excellent views. The jacuzzi didn't work, but it was nice to sit in anyway. I think they overcholorinate the pool though. It was nice to have changing rooms at the hotel pool; I don't like to wander through a grand hotel in my swimsuit on my way to/from the pool!Pike's Place Cafe used to have such wonderful regional cuisine; they've since replaced the menu there and for room service with the new Sheraton standard. I like to experience regional cuisine when I travel, but I must admit, the carrot cake on Sheraton's menu is to die for!Guest service at this property is intuitive. When I asked the front desk for the location of the nearest cellular telephone store so I could buy a new charger for my cell phone, the clerk produced a box of them from housekeeping. Apparently a lot of guests leave cell phone chargers in their rooms and he allowed me to pick out the one that matched from the box!

<Content>Excellent Location... We stayed at the Sheraton before we went to a Mariners game. We booked through Airmiles and we never received our certificate, Airmiles faxed a letter to the front desk and we had no problems checking in.There was a conference and they were oversold and they offered a room at another hotel if we wished and we declined and there was no pressure. The room was nice, very clean and the bed was SUPER comfy!!!There was construction but we were on the 26th floor and could not hear a single thing...Only thing that ----- was the charge for valet parking which isnt optional...26 plus tax...but you are allowed to stay parked even after check out so you can go and explore the city....Would stay again...

<Content>Amazing downtown location We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton for 5 nights. The best part is the location. The hotel is in the downtown shopping district and all the tourist stuff is walking distance from the hotel. I would not pay full price for this hotel but definitely look for deals on hotwire and other internet sites. The hotel claims to be 4 stars but it isn't. We had to carry our stuff to the room. They did not have much staff working late (we got to the hotel at 1145pm). The rooms and hallways are worn out but the location makes up for it. Would definitely stay there again only if we can get a good deal online.

<Content>Loved the Seattle Sheraton ! Stayed at the Sheraton Seattle 2 nights pre-cruise to Alaska...most enjoyable. Great service from the front desk and concierge and wonderful pool / hottub facilities on the top floor. Great central location, easy walking distance to Pike Market and short cab ride to Seattle Centre. Non-smoking facility a definite plus. Although construction going on to add an additional tower to the complex, we were located on the far side and heard absolutely no noise on the 19th floor. Really comfortable beds.

<Content>Great Place to Stay We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton 3 nights from July 1st. That was the second time we've stayed at the Sheraton and like the first time, we enjoyed our stay very much. The only thing was that it is under renovation so it was a little inconvenient but it was still a great stay. The rooms were very nice and the staff were very nice and helpful. If we went back to Seattle, we would definitely stay at the Sheraton.

<Content>Pleased with the Sheraton We stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise and were quite pleased. Got it via Hotwire for around $130/night (more like $155 including taxes) and subsequently read some reviews about construction noise so had some concerns. Not an issue. Our room was on the 25th floor and was quite nice. A typical conference hotel. Located in an area with lots of nice shops and restaurants, particularly in a shopping center only 1 block away. Also an easy walk to Pike Place market and the waterfront. The Greyline tour buses and airport shuttle have a desk in the lobby and it was convenient as we took a tour to Mount Ranier one day and also used the shuttle to get to the airport. The room was fairly spacious with a big window ledge you could set things on, a large table for a desk, two chairs and a table for a reading corner, 2 beds with comfortable bedding. Attractive decor. We checked out the pool and it was OK. Kind of small and very crowded with families both times we went. The whole pool is 4 feet deep -- no shallow or deep end. My only minor complaint was that it was difficult to access the free internet. They had one computer located at the check-in desk and I had to check 4 times before it was available.

<Content>Located in the Heart of Downtown Shooping Stayed at the Sheraton 3 nights and we enjoyed ourselves. A lot of pros but there were a few cons.Pros-Location, location  location. The hotel is located in the middle of downtown Seattle shopping district, an easy walk to Nordstrom, Macy, Pacific Place, Pike's and other shopping places. Walking around downtown Seattle is relatively an easy stroll because everything is pretty close to each other.Hotel room is adequate in size, 26th floor offered a nice view of the high rise buildings and part of Elliott Bay. Beds offer a good night sleep that my wife enjoyed immensely.Cons- No self parking, only valet at $28 per day. Even though we didn't use our car for the 3 days (walked around), the hotel billed us almost 100 bucks.Construction noise from the new hotel tower being built next to the hotel. From our window, we could see and hear the work crew going at it at 7 in the morning.Housing keeping was slow and one day, our room wasn't made after 3 pm, had to call housekeeping to clean our room so that we could make a 6 pm dinner engagement.Overall-we enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton and may return and stay at the new tower once it is completed next year. Grade- a solid B.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, where's the beef? I was pleasantly suprised over the weekend to find that the Sheraton Hotel in downtown Seattle was not the run down, dirty, and unfriendly place that some other visitors experienced. We stayed Memorial Day weekend, and found the place to be immaculate. The entire staff was friendly and efficient, and while there is indeed construction of a new wing going on, it was a very minor inconvenience. The room itself was large, well appointed, and the bed was excellent. There was an iron  board, Starbuck's coffee in the coffee maker, and lots of PPV movies. The view from our 27th floor bedroom was spectacular! I highly recommend this place. Oh, and by the way, $28 per night for valet auto service seems cheap; San Francisco was $46 a day last week!

<Content>Loved the Sheraton We were at the Sheraton for 3 nights. The hotel is currently expanding and there is quite a bit of construction, but that did not interfere with our stay. We were appointed a room on the 26th floor with a great view of downtown Seattle. The Sweet Sleeper beds are exactly that -- best nights sleep I've had in at least a year. No problems with noise, one of the quieter hotel rooms I've experienced.Pikes Market is a few blocks away, easily within a 5 to 10 minute walk. Location of the hotel is ideal for those who want to shop. The shopping district is literally outside the front door. Only complaint is there are not many restaurants in the immediate area and the restaurant in the hotel has a limited selection with sky high prices. Airport Transporter run by Gray Line is very dependable stopping at the hotel every 30 minutes.

<Content>Poor Quality - Poor Service - Under Construction - Attitude I was extremely disappointed with my stay at Seattle Sheraton. The service was horrendous, the beds were improperly made, front desk had attitude. There was no concierge and the business center was not available because of construction. I travel 3 of 4 weeks a month and found this property to be less than satisfactory and the service provided was unpleasant. The front desk compensated us with 3 $15 food credits for the bedding problems, which were never corrected. The beds are short sheeted which causes the bed to unravel and we found our selves sleeping on the bare mattress (disgusting) when we woke up in the morning. The $15 food credits did not satisfy us due to the poor quality of food, service and cleanliness. The food in the restaurant was cold, service was slow, and each time I ate in there (the first when we didn鈥檛 know any better and the 2nd 2nd time was because of the food coupons) - either the silverware was dirty or the water glasses and coffee cups were dirty, and expensive 鈥?breakfast buffet for $25. The pool area was poorly ventilated and I cut my foot on a broken drain cover in the whirlpool, shortly after that a young boy sliced his foot open and a house doctor was called. I mentioned my foot at check out the next morning and all they said was they were sorry. The noise from the construction was annoying at 6am and we were not notified in advance that services promised (business center, concierge) would not be available. Parking at $28 was obscene and the $1.50 for 6 oz. bottle of water in the vending machine was ridiculous - the picture showed a full size water bottle. Horrible - absolutely horrible.

<Content>Hot hotel The hotel itself was in the heart of downtown, so for the price, it was great. However, i hate to be nickle and dimed for everything. The major flaw was the valet parking at $28.00 a day, a daily charge of $9.95 for internet service, and the biggest flaw was the heat. The thermostat would not go below 65 degrees, well some of you might think that is cool enough, but not on the 19th floor. There was no cross air, so it was warm adn stuffy. Also the vent was about 1 foot by 1 foot, so not much area to blow cool out from either. The room became a sauna when showering, so if you styled your hair, it would be ruined from all the moist heat and no fan in the bathroom. also this hotel is rated as a 4 star, which I highly doubt and even the quality linens they advertise were sheets that you could see though, no fitted bottom sheet, so we were fighting the mattress pad all night, and their towels had holes! That is not a 4 star hotel.

<Content>Major Hotel Construction In Progess I've stayed at the Seattle Sheraton a couple of times. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. They show little wear. The hotel is well suited for family or business travel. The hotel location is excellent, centrally located in downtown Seattle.Major construction just started this spring and is scheduled to be done in 2007. 400 rooms are being added in a new tower being built next to the existing tower. According to the hotel staff, this will make the Sheraton the largest hotel in Seattle.Parking is problematic. All self-parking at the hotel is gone. It's all valet, at $28.00 bucks a day. No additional parking is being added for the expansion, so once complete, parking could become a major headache.

<Content>Perfect Location If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel right in the middle of everything, then this hotel is for you. The first thing that I have to say about this hotel is that it isn't overly fancy, but the important things are there. The rooms are simple but very clean, beds are comfortable, and all the basic ammenities that you would need are available. For me, the best part about the hotel is where it is situated. There are restaurants and shopping galore right outside your doorstep. Pike Place Market is about a ten minute walk and for those of you that have never been there, I highly recommend you reserve some of your time to check it out. There are so many cool little shops with things that you probably wouldn't find anywhere else and the prices are pretty reasonable as well. Also, if you are wondering about where to go for a fantastic meal, I recommend going to The Cheesecake Factory which is basically right across the street from The Sheraton. Not only do they have about twenty different kinds of mouth-watering cheesecake to choose from, but they also have regular food as well with a fifteen page menu to choose from. We had the best waiter that I have ever had and he was completely honest with us about what was good on the menu and what was not so good and he made us feel like we had known him for years!If you decide to eat here I suggest that you either come early or eat late otherwise you will probably have at least an hour wait to get a table. One last thing I have to mention about the hotel is that they are undergoing construction until spring of 2007 so the outside is not that attractive right now and if you are going to book a room there I would maybe suggest that you ask for a room on another side. They automatically put us on another side and we did not hear a thing. There isn't anything that stood out about this hotel that was fantastic but there wasn't anything that was bad either so I would definately suggest a stay here.

<Content>Pretty good stay! I enjoyed out stay at this hotel. Rooms were clean, staff was really friendly and we had a pretty great view of the downtown area!Not to mention it is very central to everything.The only things I had a bit of a problem with was that it was VERY over priced for some items. For example, long distance phone calls were expensive, snacks from the gift shop were overpriced, my friend got a bottle of water from the vending machine - paid a 1.25 and the bottle was a mini bottle, with about just a cup of water. You HAVE to have your car valet parked and it was about 30.00 a day.But other than that it was a good stay. The city was great, people were REALLY friendly, we are going back to explore more again soon.

<Content>no problems- but nothing amazing I was in Seattle for a meeting at the convention center. The Sheraton was well situated for this, and also was very convenient to great restaurants and shopping. We had a club level room, which was surprisingly small, but comfortable and with a phenomenal view. Club level breakfast was very good. All in all, the Sheraton is your standard convention style hotel, that was comfortable and staffed by friendly employees. I would stay again for a work trip, but probably try something more interesting for a personal trip.

<Content>Good Location, Nice Hotel, Great Time I booked this hotel on hotwire and got a great price of 107 p/n for a weekend. Our room was clean, nice and the staff was very friendly. The beds were so comfortable,it was hard to get up in the morning.Tip- Upgrade for $30.00 to the club level and it includes 2 free breakfast buffets ( 43.00 savings ) The facilities are great the pool and jacuzzi were fantastic, the cardio room was nice but I didn't have time to take advantage of it. All and all we had a great stay! Can't wait to go back !!!!

<Content>Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. I travel for a living and this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I stayed in this hotel in November, 2005. The room was on climate control and it was very cold. On the first day,the shower pressure was so low that I couln't wash the conditioner out of my hair. The second day, I was unable to take a shower because the water was either very hot or cold. It would not reach a warm temperature. When I asked the clerk at the front desk, he said that the hotel was under construction and all of the pipes were messed up. Room service at breakfast was 1/2 hour late and the server showed up just as I was leaving to attend a meeting. I did not have time to eat. I tried to have a quick cup of coffee but it was stone cold. I had to argue with the staff to take the meal off my bill. Two personal items of mine were taken from my room and again, the staff argued. I spent two hours in the business center preparing business related emails. The center took my $50 and then notified me that the emails could not be delivered due to technical difficulties. When I approached the front desk for assistance, I was told that there was nothing they could do, and literally responded that it was not they're problem. Fifty dollars were added to my bill for items from the mini-bar which I did not order. It was explained that I was charged for items from the previous customer. When I questioned how they did this, the staff argued with me rudely and insulted me. A client of mine reserved the room and intended to pay for it. I became aware at check out that they had charged my credit card. The staff shugged their shoulders and stated that that was the way they did things. Since the arrangement was for the client to pay for expenses, the hotel staff made him come down to the hotel with his credit card and to add insult to injury, made him fill out a long document which delayed an appointment by 10 minutes. As someone who travels internationally, he commented on the rude and hostile behavior of the clerk. I left a note for the general manager and asked for his comments. I also left a telephone message for him but he never returned my call. Not only would I never stay in this hotel again, but I will never patronize another Sheraton establishment.

<Content>Nothing Special Stayed during a business meeting; was upgraded to a club level room. I was expecting something nice but really could not tell the difference between a standard room and a club level room(if you asked). The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was alright. Put the AC on high, but the room still felt like a sauna. The hotel staff were very courteous and the valet staff had their work cut out for them...Overall: If you are coming to Seattle on vacation, I would go somewhere more unique. If it's for business, I guess this place is alright

No priceline attitude by the f desk. Room was great with no complaints. Would we stay here again. Yes. Very convenient to shopping and fish market.

<Content>Great location, a bit overpriced We stayed here for our anniversary in the summer of 05. First, you absolutely can't beat the location. All the major sights are easy walking distance. We had family staying at the Warwick and they often had to take a taxi to some of the places we met them because of the walking distance. The room was great, we didn't use any of the restaurants or cafes in the hotel so we can't comment on them.The bads: While valet service is easy to use, it's way too expensive in my book. $36.00? Yikes! Plugging in to the Internet service in the room cost $9.00, unacceptable to me considering the hotel and star rating, and also considering I've stayed in many hotels at half the price with free DSL or free wireless. I expect more from a Sheraton. Elevators are slow, often quicker to take the stairs. Check in was a bit of a hassle. Tried to check in 30 minutes before official check-in time, was told to come back because my room wasn't ready. Came back 15 minutes later, told to come back again. Came back to counter at exact check-in time, my room was ready. Coincidence? Doubtful. I got the impression they were making me wait until the actual check-in time to let me register, not cool. It's not like I was trying to check in two hours early. There were obviously rooms ready, they just didn't want to let me have any of them until the official time.Would I stay here again? Yes. Despite the irritations, the location still wins out for me.

<Content>excellent hotel. highly recommed. I booked this hotel off of priceline so I received a really good rate and of course didn't know before i booked that I would get this hotel. I was very happy when i arrived at the Sheraton. Excellent location. The perfect large urban hotel. I had a room on a high floor with a great view. The room was clean and comfortable if on the small side. But that was ok. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were soft. The pool and gym on the top floor of the hotel have panoramic views of the city. A perfect place to stay if you are in the city for the weekend. There was high speed internet which was $9 a day which was reasonable in my book. I wish I could have stayed longer. Highly recommend

<Content>Careful what you book. Be careful of the room type if you are more than one person. Husband and I were put in a room with two double beds(no kings available) and the beds took up most of the room. Two lounge chairs were struck in the corner where you couldn't really even see the TV. Since we were going to be spending six nights, we moved to another hotel with much bigger rooms,Inn at Harbor Steps, which I highly recommend.Location was very central and great for shopping and the linens and bed were very comfortable. Staff very nice, but couldn't change the room.

<Content>Location, Location, Location Stayed at the hotel in late August for cousin larry's wedding. Location is awesome -- very central and walking distance to lots of restaurants, shops, and sites. Wedding was at the Washington Athletic Club which is right across the street -- very convenient.Very large hotel. Was upgraded (due to Platinum Starwood Status) on first night to towers room -- nicer amenities and access to club lounge and free breakfast and butler service. We ate at the breakfast buffet on Sunday. Not bad but not worth the $20+ price (if you have to pay out of your own pocket). On 2nd night, upgraded to a junior suite. Fairly spacious, clean, comfortable bed with ok linens. Gym is ok, pool had lots of noisy screaming kids.Would stay again for the great location. We had stayed at the W in April 2005. More expensive but much more modern rooms (not as great/central a location).Be sure to visit the fish market and check out the great selection of flowers.

<Content>Great Location Stayed in Seattle from July 21-23. The Sheraton is at a great location. Shopping and restaurants everywhere. Rooms were ok. Definitely an older hotel, but well kept. Even though Sheraton said it was renovated in 2002, looks like just the bathroom counter and floor was updated. Tub and tile walls look older. Only 1 or 2 elevators were working. All and all, a nice hotel.

<Content>Great location, but not much more I was here for a week in June, and it was my fifth stay in 10 years. It has gone downhill in recent years. The nice restaurant is gone (but there are many close to the hotel). The lobby and rooms were a little shabby. I had to have lights replaced and something else repaired. It took forever to check in- only one person at the counter. I didn't get a mini bar key at check-in, or for 3 hours after requesting one (and boy did I need a beer after being delayed on Alaska Air!). I had to call 3 times for the key and 2 for the lightbulb. I got a $20 certificate for the inconvenience.Room service is very quick, but the quality is poor. Same exact food if you are at the cafe, room service or catering a banquet. I have catered events at this hotel and they used to be great. Can't beat the view on the 35th floor. This year the food was barely good.The pool is indoors upstairs and has a strong chlorine smell that wafts to the fancy ballroom.Rooms are very small. Beds are comfy. For $200 I would like a turn down and chocolate, decent room service and not have to spend a fortune on the phone or internet acess.Good location, but there are many other hotels around.

<Content>Loved the Sheraton We had a great time at the Sheraton in downtown Seattle. We stayed there 3 nights (July 5, 6 and 13, 2005), and were upgraded upon arrival to a Club Level room which included a wonderful Continental Breakfast, evening hors d'oevres, and use of the swimming pool and exercise room. The rooms were very clean and comfortable; in fact, the beds were the most comfortable we slept on the entire 8 days we were on vacation in the Pacific northwest. We had no wait at all to check in or check out, and every staff member we had contact with was both friendly and professional. As mentioned by others, the location is ideal: 6 blocks from Pike's Market and the harbor, and one block from the monorail which goes directly to the Space Needle. We didn't rent a car while we were in downtown Seattle because everything we wanted to see was within easy walking distance: great restaurants, art museums, etc. While the restaurant in the hotel is a bit pricey, the food was excellent, and again, the service was flawless and friendly. We had a great time at the Sheraton, and would definitely stay there again if we return to Seattle.

<Content>Expensive but great location for downtown Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. I was there for a conference from 5/27-5/31. I give it an above average rating because it is better than say a Days Inn or EconoLodge type place. The location really can't be beat if you are there for the conference center or for if you're just dithering around downtown Seattle and want to stay in slightly upscale digs. It's very easy to get to Mt. Rainier from there as well.Check-in was a bit of a wait but the staff person was nice. I know that it was a holiday weekend but the hotel was one of the conference hotels so it wasn't like they were ignorant of our arrival.Later on in the stay I had to go back twice at different times of day to talk to someone about splitting the bill with my colleague. I thought it was a bit strange that the staff was having such a hard figuring it out. Very polite, though.The in-house restaurant is ridiculous. For a cheap breakfast go up a block towards the Hilton hotel and there is a reasonable breakfast/lunch kind of place. The owner lived for a long while in Hawaii and has dressed up the place with photos and knick knacks from the place. Very yummy egg sandwiches and his pancakes have a nice hawaiian twist to them. ;)The bed was SO comfortable and the room was kept up each day. There is a mini fridge in the room but it is locked up due to all the goodies stored inside. We didn't eat anything from the fridge but asked for the key so that we could store our cheesecake slices from the Cheesecake factory right around the corner. By the way, the hotel is in an excellent location for casual shopping at Pike Market or two mall type places. The hotel is only one short block from the conference center. It is also within easy walking distance of the monorail that takes you out to the space needle and science fiction museum.I rarely use the concierge at any hotel but we did this time at two different times. One person made a reservation for us at the Space Needle restaurant (it revolves and the food is decent) and another gave us directions for getting to Mt. Rainier.Don't use the hotels computer room, though. If you didn't bring your computer and you want to check your email or make quick copies, just run over to the Kinko's in the conference center. The minute charges are 20cents cheaper. I never thought I would ever say that Kinko's was cheap but there it is.

<Content>Goods and Bads I stayed at the Sheraton for four days in May 2005. The goods: Location: Great. Walking distance to almost everything you'd want to see in the downtown area.Rooms: Really nice. Light soothing decor. Very comfortable bed with a variety of pillows. coffee maker. Concierge: Very helpfulThe bads:Elevators: -- not enough and very slowCoffee shop: -- ridiculously expensive. There is a $20 breakfast buffet that didn't look spectacular. I only wanted oatmeal, juice and coffee so ordered from the menu. The bill was still $20.Desk staff: Well -- After being notified by phone message at 5:00p.m.on Friday night that a fax was waiting for me at the front desk (the business center was closed), when I went to get it, the staff couldn't find it after 15 minutes of searching. I told the desk person to find it and I would pick it up after dinner. At 9 p.m. I asked again. After 20 minutes the desk person said, that must have been a duplicate message and there was no fax. I said I doubted that and said that I was expecting a fax. I asked that the fax, when found, be delivered to my room. At 10:00 p.m. the fax was slipped under my door. It had actually been received at the hotel at 10:00a.m. on Thursday morning -- 36 hours before I received it. As it was after business hours there was nothing I could do about the important message that needed a timely response. I complained to the manager on duty the next morning and she did apologize and she credited $75 against my hotel bill. That did not compensate for the cost to me because I couldn't respond to the fax. Would I stay there again -- Maybe. It was better and less expensive than the W Hotel, where I stayed a couple of years ago.

<Content>Overall great hotel I stayed here, for 6 days in October 2004, while at a convention. I brought my wife and toddler son.The location is incredibly convenient in downtown Seattle, close to the Convention Center, Pike's Marketplace and several restaurants.The front desk staff was less than cordial but provided us with the room we wanted in a reasonable amount of time.The room we received had a good view (we could see a little of Puget Sound) and was clean and comfortable. The facilities were well maintained and the pool was an added plus.Service (room service, bell staff, maid service, concierge) was friendly and excellent.On-site restaurants were over-priced, with unimpressive food and spotty service.The hotel was a little pricey, despite convention-associated discounts, but reasonable considering the overall consistent quality.Notably, on checking out there was a mistake on the bill (a mini-bar charge of  $10) which was disputed and removed promptly, but without any type of apology for the mistake. Overall, the front desk again left me with a bad taste in my mouth that marred an otherwise decent stay.In sum, a great hotel with consistently excellent service which is family-friendly. It's a little pricey, considering the mediocre restaurant offerings, but a reasonable value. They probably need to monitor their front desk staff more carefully, who offer both the first impression and the last impression to customers.

<Content>Nice place to stay I stayed at the Sheraton for 3 nights on buisness. The Sheraton is a very nice business hotel. The room was a good size, very comfortable bed (not the best I've ever had but still comfy) and an average bathroom. Maid service was good, except they forgot to leave clean towels the first morning. Elevators to floors 1-20 were slower than average, but they had one down for renovations so I'm sure that it played a big part in that. The location was perfect, in the heart of the city and we could walk or take a quick $5 to $6 cab ride to everything you could want to see. It's also convienant to the cruise port, so if you need a place to stay pre or post cruise, you can't beat the location. It is also a stop on the Grey Line hop-on-hop-off bus tour, if that's your sightseeing style. DO NOT rent a car if you can avoid it, parking at the hotel is about $23 a night for self park, and parking throughout the city is expensive and/or hard to find. I didn't eat at the restaurant at the Sheraton, but several of my buisness meetings included breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the main ballroom. The food was average banquette food, nothing special. One night my co-worker and I decided to ditch the event that was planned that night and ask the concierge to recomend a steakhouse. She was very helpfull and told us of a place called Daniel's, it was about a $6 cab ride. OH BOY was the food good! Best steak I've ever had! Plus the concierge had a free appetizer sent to our table, a very nice touch! If you have the time and money ($30 and up for an entre) you MUST make the effort to dine here. Overall, while I don't think the hotel is quite worth the 4 diamond AAA rating, it's a comfortable and well located place to stay while in Seattle.

<Content>Perfect location for a Seattle visit We spent 2 days over Memorial Day weekend at the Sheraton Seattle. It is a big downtown hotel. We got the room through Hotwire at a price less than the usual price, but the hotel staff did not treat us any differently. We had a room on the 17th floor, overlooking the front of the hotel with a glimpse of Puget Sound.The room itself was quite spacious and very clean. There were wonderful, fresh linens and duvet cover. You are offered the option of having your bed made with fresh linens every day. The beds were very comfy and soft. There were sheers and blackout drapes , which were useful at this time of year with extended daylight hours.The room had a large dresser, open closet and plenty of space for our many suitcases. There was a safe in the room and a basket of snacks {for a price}, but we did not make use of these amenities. The lobby is spacious and there were 4 elevators for our section of the hotel. One of the main advantages of staying here was the Grayline desk in the lobby. We had purchased the GOSeattle card, and utilized the Hop on Hop off double decker bus, which stops out front and we went on the Mt. Ranier tour {offered through GoSeattle card if space is available}. The location is in the midst of alot of downtown stores, like Old Navy, Ann Taylor and Niketown. There is a movie theatre right across the street, McDonalds 3 blocks away and the Pike Market 6 blocks downhill. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant, as we were too busy. The only negative experience was with the concierge desk. I had asked my husband to arrange a Towncar for our airport trip. He came back with arrangements costing $66. I immediately cancelled that service and called a place in one of the Seattle guides and got a car for a flat rate of $35. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Seattle Sheraton Doesn't Disappoint The Seattle Sheraton is a very nice hotel. The bed is amazingly comfortable and a definite highlight after a long day. The hotel is located in a great location, within walking distance to the Pike's Market and to the Monorail that takes you to where the Space Needle, EMP and other attractions are located. Overall, I found Seattle to be a very clean and nice city. Don't miss a trip to Mt. Ranier, which is spectacular. The concierge was very helpful and accessable in making reservations for anything. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Seattle.

<Content>A Great Hotel This Hotel is a great one! It is located in the heart of downtown seattle near shopping and it is a great location. The beds are so comfortable and they have a great pool on the top floor. What I didnt like was that you had to pay for everything. They put goodies and snacks in your room and then charge you like 2 bucks for a candy bar. But otherwise, great view and location! my stay here was awesome!

<Content>Great bed! I am a Priceline fan and often have gotten good deals on hotels. I stayed at the Sheraton for Christmas Eve and again in early May. My main reason for staying there is the lovely pool. It's on a high floor and has a great view of the city, especially at night. I was QUITE disappointed the last time I stayed there and the pool was closed. Especially since I wouldn't have stayed there if I had known that to begin with (I live in Seattle, I just wanted to get away for the night and swim and have room service). The person who checked us in at the front desk said the jacuzzi would be open but when we went up there at 9:30 it was also shut down. We had earlier been offered a chance to go to the Westin and use their pool but by 9:45pm we didn't have a chance to get there in time (Pool closure at 10pm) I did ask if they could call over to the Westin and keep it open a bit longer but I don't think the person I asked did it. Though on this night the Westin pool would have been used by their own guests, the Sheraton's guests and the W hotel guests, (they normally use the Sheraton pool, these are all Starwood properties) by my calculations, that's a whole mess of guests (2000 plus) for one pool, I really think they could have made the exception and kept it open later.Their beds are terrific! So comfortable! Bathroom is decent, extremely clean. Their bath products could use an upgrade though, I can get Pantene at the drugstore.Outstanding cheeseburger! I know that sounds funny but it was so awesome, one of the best I ever have had! Also it's such a pleasure to actually have something prepared medium-rare when you request it.So-so service. Much better on Christmas Eve, complimentary cookies and more positve attitudes. I paid the same rate both times. I do honestly feel that I wasn't treated that well because I was a Priceline customer. That's too bad, especially since I didn't force them to accept my bid. I was also double charged for my room. Once when I bid, (the way it's supposed to work) and again when I checked out. This actually caused me a lot of problems since it was a debit and not a credit card. I ended up having an overdraft and it took nearly ten days to fix. The accounting dept were really hard to get ahold of and I kept getting bounced around from manager to manager. Finally I spoke with John Haase, he offered me a free upgrade to the Club Level room the next time I stay there (this was prior to the overdraft in my account). When that happened I called againand spoke with a woman (didn't get her name unfortunately). She was incredibly rude and just kept asking me to fax my bank records over to her (I informed her that I didn't have access to a fax machine and she still kept insisting I fax the papers). Why this was necessary, I don't know, since I live in Seattle and could have brought them to the hotel. She acted as if I was lying and made me so mad I had to get off the phone.So, their offer for a free upgrade will probably not get used. That's just too little too late for what was an extremely frustrating situation (especially since I'm a Starwood preferred guest).

<Content>Nice hotel! Obviously, this hotel is a part of the Sheraton chain, and so you know you're probably going to get a nice (albeit possibly bland) experience when staying here.I stayed for 5 nights in June 2003, and had a nice stay. My room wasn't huge, but was spacious enough, and very clean. The only niggle would be that there was a door connecting my room to the adjoining room, through which you could hear the other occupants talking. But apart from that, the room was quiet, light, and clean.The bathroom was slightly cramped, but again - very clean and everything worked as expected. Lots of decent-sized towels were provided, plus complimentary shampoo and - well, the usual.Checking in and out was quick and efficient, and the staff were really friendly. I was especially happy with the concierge, who was really cheery and helped me out repeatedly (being from England, I was slightly confused by the bus system in Seattle - paying when you get in on one direction, paying when you get out on another, but she humoured me as I got her to take me through the process step by step! :-D)The food was nice, although the menu wasn't huge. The waiters seemed pleasant enough, and the location was great.A good solid choice of hotel; nothing particularly special, but you'll be guaranteed a pleasant, no-risk stay. Recommended.

<Content>Great Location, Room and Service Just stayed 3 nights at this hotel. We did not rent a car and the location of this hotel could not have been better. We walked to all of the downtown locations and restaurants and easily reached the monorail and other public transportation. There was a bit of a wait at check-in because of the line, but the front desk staff moved quickly and efficiently. Room was lovely, spacious and clean. Highly recommend this hotel, especially if you can get it at a discount (we booked thru Priceline at $98/night).

<Content>Great View! This is a great hotel to stay at if you travel to Seattle. We stayed here last week, March 28, for one night. The view out of our room was terrific, we were on the 23rd floor facing Downtown. We could see Puget Sound through the skyscrapers, with the mountains behind. The location was great, and the service was great. Overall a great place to stay.

<Content>Good Times at the Sheraton My wife and I stayed that the Sheraton at the end of our honeymoon trip, which included time in Vancouver and a cruise to Alaska. By the time we got to Seattle, we were exhausted and looking forward to a few carefree days in Seattle. The Sheraton did not disappoint.The Sheraton is located in a great location in downtown Seattle. You are about a six block walk to Pike Place, and the walk was very easy to do. You are also about one block away from Westview Mall, a Barnes  Noble, movies and The Cheesecake Factory. Plus, there are a ton of Starbucks around (although I think this is true for all of Seattle). The walk to the Space Needle is very long, and you should take either public transportation (the monorail system was not working while we were in Seattle) or a taxi. Also, if you want to go to a Mariners game, you should also take the bus to the game, because the walk is a fairly long one.The room itself was very nice and large enough for us, our luggage and enough room to not feel cramped. The bed was comfy and soft and the bathroom was clean. The only problem was it was everything cost there. To get internet access, you needed to pay $9.95 per day and as it turned out, it would normally forget that you paid for it earlier in the day and would double charge you (the hotel did take care of that). And the cost to print anything was absolutely outragous.Overall, if you can get the room at a good rate (we used Hotwire to get the room during the week in August and paid $125 per night), this hotel rocks.

<Content>All was wonderful We stayed at the Sheraton Seattle from Sept 14-17 and had a great time in the city and at or around the hotel. I would highly recommend buying whatever upgrade that will give you access to the club lounge because the lounge breakfasts and evening appetizers really added a lot to our stay there. I was pleased with service and happy with the location as well because it was so close to everything we wanted. The website and people at the 800 number (I booked directly through Starwood/Sheraton) were a bit deceptive. I was under the impression that there might be a partial ocean view and there isn't unless you consider a glimpse of the ocean between the surrounding highrises to be partial ocean view which I guess technically it is. I was made to believe that there was a salon/spa in the hotel. There is not. There is a massage room available adjacent to the swimming pool which is not my idea of relaxation especially when there is a group of kids splashing and squealing in the swimming pool. There is, however, a full service salon just across the street from the hotel called Marko's where I was able to schedule a facial and pedicure. Overall the service was great but not excellent. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again since our stay there was pleasant as long as I could get access to the fitness club as well as the club floor with it's lounge.

<Content>Luxurious room Upon arrival, I was able to check-in with ease. My room was beautifully appointed and the bathroom was immaculate. The convention center is conveniently across the street from the property and there are several restaurants in close proximity (even the hotel's restaurant warrants a visit). The staff was always courtesous and helpful. This is the place to stay if you are visiting downtown Seattle.

<Content>Don't wast you time with SPG or the Sheraton I have booked two nights ( Confirmation # 1231***69) at the SheratonSeattle. This was for 2 rooms and originally from 16th of Oct to 19th ofOct. On Oct 13th, I check my Confirmation and found that there was only oneroom not two and the dates were from Oct 16th to 18th Only. After making aphone call to the Hotel, I was transferred to the reservation ManagerDeborah Herforth. She was very irate, I had no idea why. I requested forthe additional date and an addition room. I also request for the same rate.The way I was treated by Deborah Herforth was unacceptable. She used me asa punching bag. She used her authority as the Reservation manager to punishme. Being a SPG Gold Guest that is 5 stays away from a Platinum member(over 20 stays this year), one would expect better respect andconsideration. I was told no, no and no... then I was asked to prove to herrates from other hotels and lectured me on how unethical I was by asking forthe same rate. And when I requested an AAA rate I was asked 3 times if I wasan AAA Member ( AAA # 429 004 ****4 0 7 - 23 year member). Then I wastold to make sure I had my AAA card with me 3 more times... as if I waslaying to her. In addition to this, I was told that she could not make the2 room reservation under my name. Even when I told her that I am paying forboth rooms! This is outrageous!! Why? I asked... she told me that this wasthe way it is, basically take it of leave it.In addition, I have paid for and planned an additional 11 rooms for ourCompany Christmas Trip at the Sheraton. After staying at this hotel 3 plustimes year alone and hosting (paid in advance) our Christmas Party, one cansee how upset I am.I have no problem with a higher rate or the miss booking confirmation.However, I do have an issue with how your most loyal customer are treated.I finally realized that being loyal to SPG mean nothing! I want to leteveryone know that SPG Gold or Platinum means nothing! Stay at the hotelthat you treats you with respect. Because, SPG loyal members are nothing inthe eyes of the local Sheraton Staff.At this point I request that my books at the Sheraton be cancel at nocharge. I have no interest of staying at this hotel when their staff hatetheir job and hate their best customers. I would not return there even ifthe accommodation were for free. And I would not stay there even if youpenalized me or charged me in full. However, I would like to let everyonein this world know how I was treated... so they don't west their time withSPG or Sheraton.I have already made reservations at the W Seattle, Mr. Alfonso Moreno theService Manager was so helpful and I really appreciate him. His hotel hasalways given the best service, and he personally has gone 110% for theguest, and for me. And he did everything in a very short time with a smile!Overall a very bad experience and something that could have been avoided ifI was just treated with a smile.I would suggest that anyone making a booking at this hotel should thinktwice as the staff there feel no regards to their best customers and noconsideration or respect.Best regards,Jimmy Wu

<Content>Good hotel, good location Stayed here for 3 nights in July 2004. Found it as you would expect for a large chain hotel. Large, smart lobby, check in staff advised us on safe areas to walk at night on arrival. However they were unable to locate the safe we apparantly had in our room! Friendly attendant in the swimming pool/gym, although lots of kids in the pool. Room fine - clean  fair size.

<Content>Good location Recently stayed 3 nights at the Sheraton. We did Priceline got the room for $100 a night Fri to Mon. Good location for the downtown area. Walking distance to Pike Street Market and a little further to Pioneer Square--but if you can walk it's not too bad. I highly recommend walking if you can the parking in the downtown area is terrible. The parking at the hotel cost $26 a night!!!! The hotel was nice and clean the room was average small bathroom and you could hear the people next door. I don't think I would of stayed here if we hadn't got a good rate with Priceline. Take note most of the restaurants in the Market Area close at 6 to 6:30 so finding a local place to eat at is kind of hard. If the weather permits suggest going to the Bank of America building on 5th street they have an observation floor that costs just $5 and it's a great view much better than the Space Needle. Don't forget your umbrella, a sweater and a coat with a hood oh and good walking shoes. It rains a lot in Seattle and it's definitely fall there temp in the 50's to 60's. Try to take a ferry ride to either Bremerton or Bainbridge Island you can drive your car or walk on. We came back from Bremerton at night and the view of downtown Seattle was awesome!!!

<Content>great hotel in great location (stay 9/23-9/24). I was very happy to get a room at the Sheraton on Priceline for $100/night -- I was excited to be able to stay at this hotel and once I arrived, the hotel did not disappoint me. The bed, pillows, and comforter were all very comfy and clean. The bathroom was very also very clean and nice. The location of the hotel was wonderful, just a short walk (5 blocks) to Pikes Market and also a short walk to the monorail that takes you directly to the space needle and Experience Music Project (EMP). Lots of shopping directly around the hotel too. I would definitely stay at the Sheraton again -- very good deal (although, try your luck on Priceline before paying top dollar directly thru the hotel).

<Content>Timing is everything.... In a nutshell: Attractive hotel, convenient location, accommodating staff--but large numbers of convention-goers create noise problems. We stayed at the Sheraton for four nights over the Labor Day weekend, and we paid around $125 per night on Hotwire. Our main complaint would be the poor soundproofing. We were on the 16th floor, and the room was spotlessly clean and spacious, but very noisy. We could hear music from the Convention Center across the street, and hallway traffic noise was magnified by the triangular layout of the hotel. (We were, sadly, at one of the points--a cul de sac of four rooms that functioned quite effectively as an echo chamber, ratcheting up even normal hallway noise into a cacophony of sound.)The hotel was hosting three conferences, so noise levels stayed high until 2 to 3 a.m. on our first two nights' stay. We called the front desk and asked if there might be a quieter room, but the only other non-smoking rooms that were available were on even lower levels, closer to street noise. The hotel did provide us with some complimentary perks, and on checkout, they cancelled our bill for incidentals. I'm not sure I'd risk bad timing and book here again, but during the lull between conferences, the hotel was quite pleasant.

<Content>Won't book again! We just returned from Seattle, where we had booked the Seattle Sheraton and Towers for three nights. We left the hotel after one night and the front desk didn't even inquire as to why we were leaving. We were on the club floor and except for 2 hours in the morning during continental breakfast and 2 hours in the evening during canapes, the lounge was closed tight. The one and only evening we were there, I poured myself coffee and used a small plastic container of cream that was in a dish beside the coffee urn. The cream was sour and curdled in my coffee and there was not one staff personnel around to even talk to. Our room was dreary and there were stains on the carpets. Although a good location, this hotel has definitely seen better days!

<Content>Excellent location! I enjoyed my stay at this hotel as it was very close to the Pike Street Market. It was a nice short walk to the market where you can sample fresh mini donuts, made on the spot in front of you or eat at one of the award winning restaurants while facing the river and mountains. The rooms at the hotel were clean, made every day and equipped with all the accoutrements needed by a traveler. Hotel staff were friendly and professional.

<Content>Great location, nice hotel This was our second stay at this hotel. It is amazing how your perspective changes depending on price. The first time we stayed at the Sheraton Towers was during the baseball All Star weekend a few years back, and we paid up ($300.00). This time we used Priceline and stayed for $100.00 plus tax. For $100.00 a night, this place is a steal. It has a wonderfully central location. It is across the street from the monorail, the convention center, and some great shopping. The hotel itself offers very solid business class accomodations. If you can get a price break, I'd definitely recommend the place.

<Content>outstanding property Wonderful, comfy pillow top bed, large clean room. Worth upgrade to the club floor where from 5-7p.m. M-F you have an assortment of treats. Coupons given on the weekend for bref. buffet which is outstanding. Normal cost $20.00 pp. Location in the heart of upgrade shopping center but far from waterfont and long hilly walk to Pikes Market.

<Content>The Place to Stay in Seattle I am very particular and I was very happy with our choice to stay at the Sheraton. Since I was working remotely while my husband was attending a convention we upgraded to a club room with a desk. This gave us access to a great continental breakfast and evening munchies. The staff was very friendly, the beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. We walked all over town from here. Avoid the double decker Gray Line tour. Dinner at the Space Needle as the sunset was a splurge, but well worth it. Wild Ginger, McCormick and Schmicks, Top pot donuts, and skating along the sound helped to make it a great working vacation. I lived in Center City Philadelphia for 10 years and was still shocked by the number of homeless people in Seattle.

<Content>Met my high expectationsw. IMO: We are picky people, and require above-average accomodations. That is, the place must be clean, organized and professional, well located, and no crime problem. Sheraton Seattle delivered the goods. The room was clean and tidy, well-kept, the sheets were crisp, no mildew in the bathtub, ther sink handles were shiny new, etc. Check-in and out was uncomplicated. Parking faciliies were good. Location was superb, 1 1/2 blocks in off of I5. Five blocks walk to Pike Place market. Room service was good, and on-time too. They provide the usual wake-up service, complimentary coffee maker and coffee supplies, blowdryer (no iron and ironing board, though). No real disappointments that I can think off. No noise problem outside, no vagrants hanging around out. Would stay there again withour reservation.

<Content>Great Loacation We stayed here for 3 night in June and it was great. The room was large and the stuff was friendly. The hotel is right in the middle of the shopping area, Pacific Place Mall and Pike Market.And just one block away (at Briazz/5th Ave.) there you can have breakfast for less money. Space Needle costs 13$ p. person, so we didn't go.We went to the Bank of America Tower Oberservation Deck for just 6$ (Floor 73) and it was great and it is higher than the Space Needle. Just 20min walk from the hotel. We would stay here again.

<Content>Big Room, Great Location We just returned back from a three night stay at the Seattle Sheraton (6/24-27). We had a great rate from Hotwire even though its high season. Ask for a higher northwest facing room to see the Pudget Sound. The room was very large and nicely furnished but only had the computer chair and one chair with ottoman for seating (kept me from giving it an excellent rating). The Sweet Sleeper bed and its five pillows was great. The concierge service was excellent. The location was awesome. We walked almost everywhere. I would stay here again.

<Content>Sheraton okay The room was large, nothing special about the bathroom, the location was great! Lots of shopping around, places to eat, and close to Pike's Market. The view from the room wasn't great. The maid insisted on cleaning our room while we were still in it. The hotel was very empty and we found out there were only 2 rooms occupied on our floor so it was very quiet! Parking was quite expensive.

<Content>We loved the Sheraton Towers in Seattle. Great hotel with a great location. One of the nicest rooms with one of the most comfy beds I have been in. Located four blocks from the Pike Place Public Market and all the shopping, it was ideal. Go to the Furla store! Marla the manger is a doll. Lots of great places to shop and eat. The Athenian in the Market is very good. The Space Needle is cool, but go there for dinner to make it worth your while. The view is killer and the food is good too. The aquarium is an ok time too. But going back to the Sheraton, it is f%^ing nice. They have a very nice staff too. Ask the concierge for coupons for any attractions. All buses that run in the downtown area are FREE, very cool. Also no need to rent a car, at least at the airport its too expensive, use the Gray Line Bus to get back and forth from the airport.p.s. Il Bistro is very nice and romantic restaurant.

<Content>Classy, Clean and Cordial I really enjoyed my stay at Seattle Sheraton. I Hotwired the room and asked for the $30 upgrade to the Club Level. The rooms were immaculate and well appointed. The business services available inthe room made for a seamless business experience. The staff was extremely nice and efficient. The breakfast on the 32nd floor Club Room was more than enough. Fresh fruit, good coffee and nice ambience. The location is minutes away from Pikes market. The workout facility is ample and up to date. The massage services are very good, professional and well priced at $75 for an hour. I would absolutely return.

<Content>loved the Sheraton Was just in Seattle for business, medical and pleasure. The Seattle Sheraton was a great place to make all 3 reasons easy and enjoyable. The location is perfect for shopping, restaurants, medical community and the convention center. The in hotel restaurant is great and some other places nearby were outstanding also. We had a car but we really could have gotten along without it. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The hotel itself is outstanding, nice rooms and great service.  Sharon
