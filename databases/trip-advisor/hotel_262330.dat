<Content>Great Stay with Family My wife, son (12 years old) and I stayed at the Millenium Hilton a few days before New Year's Eve. The purpose of the trip was to catch some shows, shop and see the sights. We purposely chose to stay away from midtown and the Times Square areas. The Millenium was at a great location to get away from the crowds and experience Lower Manhatten, but still convenient to Broadway, Central Park and shopping. There were several subway stations very close to the hotel.The hotel met and exceeded our expectations for a NYC hotel. We had a junior suite on the 51st floor that was super clean, comfortable and fairly spacious. Our room had views of the rivers, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and into the Trade Center's work site. My son really enjoyed the bird's eye view and watching the construction on the WTC site. The construction activities did not bother us.The hotel's front desk, bell and security staff were very friendly, helpful and courteous. The front desk was able to accommodate our requests for early check in and late check out. Although parking was expensive ($65 a day/SUV), it was on site and the parking attendants were very efficient during a very busy time.It you are looking for grand public spaces, a lot of restaurants and an ostentatious atmosphere, this is not your hotel. But, if you are looking for an upscale hotel in a great location with modern, very comfortable and clean rooms with great staff, then you may want to consider this hotel.

<Content>average...given 'priceline' room stayed there during an expensive time, between christmas and new years...got an ok deal thru priceline...would have preferred times square or midtown west, but felt this area was fine.I arrived at 9pm from a long day of flying...sarah at the front desk checked us in, friendly enough, but given a dreaded 'priceline' room...i asked for 2 double beds and something quiet away from the elevator...was given a king right across from the elevator...had a bellman with us, I wouldn't even go into the room..didn't want to hear ding all night....he was very helpful and got us a room further down the hall, but a lower level..it was very noisy due to the WTC construction....went downstairs to complain and was offered to get a new room tomorrow or they could send up a sound machine of some type...decided to suck it up and spend one night in that room..the next morning went downstairs to get a new room and got a better one...27th floor corner room with 2 double beds...was very satisfied with this room...internet was fast, beds were comfy and tv was huge...Didn't eat at the restaurants..easy access to subway...be sure and take the e and not a or c on the way home or you'll end up several streets away trying to find your way back home...my only complaint is the comforters smelled dirty and they never changed the pillowcases while i was there and one was dirty with food and not from us....

<Content>Grim This hotel is okay but very austere. But the thing I would want others to know is that the rooms overlook the former World Trade Center so if looking out at the site of a massacre of 3,000 people is a downer for you, maybe try another hotel. Restaurant is grossly overpriced and inefficient if polite service. Small rooms but not too bad for NYC.

<Content>Convenient locale, noisy We love the hotel for being in Financial/ lower Manhattan which, although not busy on the weekends, is very handy for Newark arrivals, next door to discount shopping Mecca Century 21. It's also right by the 5/6 subway and walking distance to the 4. On a nice day, it's an easy walk to Chinatown, Little Italy, Bowery and TribecaOn the downside, it's dead at night and the construction at the twin towers means a lot of noise unless you pay extra for a city view.

<Content>Perfect Stay at the Millenium This is an excellent hotel, with large rooms (by NYC standards) and excellent views. The location is excellent (subway stop right outside the hotel entrance) and next to Ground Zero as others have noted. The construction noise was not an issue- I did notice that the cranes were working early Sunday morning when I looked out of our window, but I could not hear them. We were on the 17th floor. Also, we found it to be very new and clean, and could not hear noise from other rooms or the hallway. We were also pleased with our rate through Hotwire. Overall, it was a fantastic stay.

<Content>Definitely NOT a 4 star.... There are some positives about this hotel... The location is great (out of the way but well connected to the subway/mass transit), the rooms are a good size, and the view is incredible. However, we experienced a number of problems which made the stay almost unsatisfactory.First of all, we came in and wanted to check out the refrigerator... but it wouldn't open for some reason. Then we noticed there was a cup missing and hair and a stain on the bed. We immediately called Guest Services and they advised they would send an engineer and house keeping up immediately to rectify the issues. We then went out of the room for a few hours to go explore. When we came back the bed was in exactly the same condition as we left it and the refrigerator still would not open. We called back down and they replied, Oh, house keeping said they already changed the sheets. This was, however, was a complete lie because we had moved pillows and the sheets around and they were untouched. After explaining this to the front desk manager she replied, Oh, OK. Do you still want the sheets made up then? Flabbergasted, I replied, Yes! That's why I called the first time 3 hours ago!! I also made sure to tell them to come after 6:30PM b/c we were in a rush to get to a dinner reservation (it was 6:00PM when I called). Five minutes later, however, both housekeeping and engineering came up and I had to explain again to please come back at 6:30. Fortunately, this time when we returned from dinner, all problems were solved... or so we thought.The next morning when we took a shower, there were long and nasty hairs all in the tub and on the tile wall of the shower. We hadn't noticed it the day before because we hadn't used the shower. This clearly showed us that they either did not clean at all or did a totally unsatisfactory job of cleaning. Overall, it's a decent hotel - fortunately, we paid a lesser rate through Priceline. However, I'm a gold member and have come to expect a certain level of service which, had I paid full rate, I would be completely dissatisfied by this stay. Management was, in general, indifferent and lackadaisical Only stay here if you get the cheapest rate possible. .

<Content>Efficient business hotel Great location for business downtown. The rooms are quite large for NY and the bathroom is modern. The best part was that we had a spare afternoon before the flight and the concierge was able to suggest the perfect tour so that I finally managed to see some of NY. Gym is brand new and quite well equiped for a hotel

<Content>Great hotel!!!! Loved it!!! Clean, comfy,spacious,relatively close to dining, shopping, etc.; yet not so close to Times Square, Central Park, etc. Otherwise, no hidden fees, no over-billing, no problems. The noise from the construction at Ground Zero was not insupportable either, they did offer earplugs and told us that we could request what they called a sleep machine were we to have trouble sleeping. As one can imagine, after an entire day of sightseeing,who needs earplugs?  We were really fascinated by their extremely fast elevators: they go from the lobby level to the 43th floor,where our room was located, in the blink of an eye. The way they just fly between floors is awesome! The only minor complaint we have was the fact that in the room adjacent to ours, a.k.a that shared an in- room door, there was someone who really enjoyed watching loud TV past 12 am...situation that of course,created some tension between us, as one of us felt like calling the front desk and informing them of the situation. Otherwise, we wouldn't doubt staying at this hotel again. On a personal note, we were really sad to see the Towers gone...which of course won't last long as they are very busy rebuilding them.

<Content>Large room - Great stay My sister and I stayed 3 nights at the Milleminum and had a wonderful stay. We had a large bathroom, king bed, full size desk with chair, large plasma TV, a mini fridge, lots of storage space, a wing chair and ottoman and still had room to move around. Our room overlooked the World Trade Center construction site, we were told that it may be noisy. There was some noise but not bothersome in the least. We took the subway everywhere, its so much faster. We purchased a daily metro pass(MTA) this made getting around easier. We walked through Tribeca, SoHo and Greenwich Village and dined in the West Village. I would highly reccomend this area. Times Square is extremely busy. We also had dinner in the port area, at the end of Fulton Street, also worth the trip.

<Content>Good Hotel Very clean, very classy. I had a suite on the 40th floor (bedroom and sitting room connected) which was the largest hotel room I have ever been in in NYC. Staff was friendly. No complaints. (Please note that there is construction going on immediately next door where the Twin Towers stood. The construction seemed to end around 9pm or so and start up again between 6am and 7am. So, if you are a light sleeper or particularly bothered by construction, I would avoid this hotel for a while.)

<Content>Decent Business Hotel This is a good business hotel - attractive lobby, decent sized and well appointed rooms. You get a birds eye view of Ground Zero and with it 24 hour noise (even thirty odd floors up). The corridors were rather drab. My real objection to this hotel was just that it seemed to lack any wow factor - but I guess that's to be expected in a large, non boutique, chain hotel.

<Content>couldn't have been better Just returned from a spur-of-the-moment honeymoon in NYC. We booked our room by naming our own price through priceline, and - to our great fortune - ended up at the Millenium Hilton for 6 nights at a very reasonable rate. Our request for a quiet room was accommodated, and I can honestly say that I don't remember sleeping as well for so many nights in a row. The bed was comfortable, the sheets were soft, the room was immaculate, and our view of the bridges and Brooklyn was fabulous. The staff was extremely helpful - my husband received great advice on romantic things to do in the city from the concierge and upon hearing that we had just gotten married the desk staff sent up complimentary chocolate dipped strawberries and sparkling wine. We weren't staying on the side that faced the WTC construction, but during the daytime the noise was not that bad on the street level. Also, the hotel is perfectly situated next to several subway stops and Century 21. Our stay couldn't have been better.

<Content>Great hotel, Location not so much We enjoyed the hotel, nicely decorated stylish rooms. Quite spacious for New York. The location is not ideal for anyone who plans to spend a lot of time midtown or uptown. Taxi's to Times Square anywhere from $11 - 15 each time and although subway is close by, during our stay the E line wasn't operating. Great location for Wall Street and walking distance to South Street Seaport. Ongoing construction at World Trade Centre site however noise was not a problem. Overall a good stay however my next visit we will stay further uptown.

<Content>Reasonable rates, great rooms, fine location With reasonable rates, excellent spacious rooms with great views of the city and a decent location close to a busy subway line this hotel quickly became my preferred place to stay in Manhattan.It may not have the immediate proximity to major New York landmarks as a hotel near Times Square, but the Millennium Hilton is less than a block to the E line. I've always found it easy to get around town using the hotel as the starting location. The nightlife round the hotel is non-existent, so you should budget for a $20 cab ride back at night -- or just take a subway back for $2.The rooms are very large and the furnishings, as with any Hilton, are excellent. Huge, comfy king beds that you can disappear into, a few chairs and tables arranged around the room, and well-sized bathrooms that are always clean.One of the biggest draws for me is the swimming pool at the hotel, which is a real treat. It's never too crowded and it's a pleasant way to unwind. There's also a sauna -- though the heat is only slightly above room temperature, so I guess it's more of a lukewarm paneled room -- fitness center and a decent business center that I've used a few times.The staff are friendly and the concierges I've dealt with all have encyclopedic knowledge of the city. They add to what is always a pleasant experience staying at this hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel, indifferent service, construction noise I stayed here for one night for a wedding in NYC. The hotel is nice, and the bedding and toiletries were decent. The shower pressure was not the greatest. The big issue I wanted to mention is that the hotel is across the street from Ground Zero, and construction is practically 24-7 there now. There was a pair of earplugs in the room and a note from the manager about it. I was there on a Saturday night and construction seemed to start around 7am Sunday. It didn't bother me because I was already up, but this could be a big issue for some.

<Content>Loud. Very LOUD !! Having read a few of the reviews for this hotel i was sceptical about the level of noice from Ground Zero. We stayed on the 39th floor and it was incredibly noisy, not just during the day but at night as well. They are working through the evening and well into the night so if you are staying here you had better be a deep sleeper.Service was reasonable although we did have to call house keeping to ensure our room was tidied and the bed was made. This was not done on our first day for some reason.Didn't have time to use the pool but it looked to be clean and in good condition.Good location for lower Manhattan but given the price of the hotel and the buidling work i would not be staying here on my next trip to NY.

<Content>A great hotel in New York at a good rate This is a great hotel. Within walking distance are 5th Avenue, Empire States building, Grand Central station, Time square. The view from my room was brilliant watching the sunrise across Brooklyn. The gym is good and the horizon pool on the 28th floor has to be seen, especially at night. Just check out the tennis court on the 32nd floor.My room was clean, well furnished and quite spacious for New York

<Content>Downtown Delight Great location in downtown NYC. We were on the 16th floor directly overlooking the WTC site and had virtually no building noise. The room was spacious, clean and luxurious - everything you would expect from a Hilton really. The bar was good but we didn't eat in the restaurant. The pool was great and the gym looked good. In a very convenient location - only a few minutes walk to Battery Park and the ferry to Liberty Island. The subway station is just outside the front entrance to the hotel. Would certainly recommend as a good base for New York visit.

<Content>Absolutely Gorgeous View!!! We will be back........... Beautiful room with the most gorgeous view of the city skyline! We were somewhere around/above the 20th floor and had a Jr Suite (end unit) with a small living room area with a bar, desk and flat screen tv. Then we had a large bedroom with a king bed and (almost) floor to ceiling windows of a magnificent city view and another large flat screen tv. Bathroom was large and clean, very nice! The staff was wonderful and very helpful whenever needed. My husband and and will be back again in October for another night in the city, can't wait. Great location for visiting both South Street Seaport and Little Italy.

<Content>Fantastic View!! The view was absolutely amazing from the 49th floor corner King Suite. The computers were down when we checked in which seems to be a problem quite a bit...could be all the construction next door at the World Trade Center though. The rooms were meticulously clean and the housekeepers know their jobs and are very efficient. You never see them, but your room is always clean and ready. The location is great - lots of nice, casual restaurants around. Got a great manicure/pedicure around the corner and sushi. Walked up to Canal Street for shopping. The lobby is horrible with all the tourists coming in and using the bathroom. It could not possibly be any smaller and it is quite astonishing how poorly laid out it is. The front desk is helpful though and just ignore the bellman and take your own bags. It isn't worth it to hail one down when the elevators are so close and quick. The beds are really soft, but the pillows are too soft so had to ask for some foam ones. They came up pronto! The only problem was our family coming to visit - they were staying at another hotel and they would ring our room often and the phone never rang. Important as they were going to leave on a flight back to the UK that night so they were in the lobby for an hour waiting for us. We didn't even know they were early. Overall, worth every penny. Use the AAA rate!

<Content>Perfectly Located in the Downtown Manhattan I stayed for one night whilst on a business trip to New York. The hotel is located next to Ground Zero. My room was on the 30th Floor and I had views over the site - it was the first time I had been in NY since 9/11- it was a reflective experience to say the least. There's lots of construction happening at Ground Zero and there were notices in the room apologising to visitors for any noise and disruption. I can honestly say I didn't hear much noise. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel had a vibrant and busy atmosphere. The room was well equipped, clean, and spacious. That combined with the location makes it perfect for business travellers.

<Content>Fantastic High Rise Hotel, Fantastic High Rise Price! Fantastic views  wonderful rooms, extremely clean, hugely comfortable bed, location ok but quite out of the way unless you have business downtown or you dont mind $ 15 cab rides each way to times square plus the $2-5 tip for the bell boy who insists on calling a cab. The big downside was total bill of $ 643 per night, all in, which includes no food, mini bar etc etc. and was not reflected as per the website. Stunned the hotel does business considering it is a long way from the madness of times square and is so expensive. A terrible shame because a very pleasant stay but will definitely choose elsewhere next time unless i win the lottery.

<Content>I love this hotel I go to one of the online sites where you bid on hotel rooms when I travel to NYC. I'm always *so* happy when my bids land me at the Millenium Hilton. I really can't believe it --I used to live in NY so feel odd staying in hotels there, and I consider myself more of a boutique hotel person than someone who frequents a big chain. But I'll say in all honesty the the bright, professional, competent and considerate Millenium staff treat you like it's a boutique hotel. Each time I've come in on the red eye from the west coast, the staff has suggested that I go freshen up in the spa and then store my luggage until my room is ready. That a.m. shower alone sets this place apart from others which (simply, reasonably) expect you to wait until check-in time. But I have also had splendid luck with my rooms at the Millenium --I'm always on a high floor, and the views over the Hudson or the Brooklyn Bridge are magic. The hotel is also very close to nearly every subway line you would want to travel on, and it's walking distance to great restaurants and sweet parks. The WTC construction is ongoing, but noise has not been a problem when I've stayed at the hotel. Just in case, each room I've been in has carried a letter from the general manager explaining the construction plan. The letter comes with a set of earplugs (so far, I've used them on the plane and in other hotels!)

<Content>Really nice hotel We stayed for 2 nights from June 28th to June 30th 2008. We booked a room on Hilton's website and chose not to pay the extra 30$ per night to have a hotel room on the 30th floor and up, yet when we checked in, we were given a room on the 54th floor facing Ground Xero. When we leaned out a bit, we could see the Statue of Liberty from our room. It was excellent! We were not bothered by construction noise, even though they worked around the clock the two days we were there. The Subway was steps away from the entrance of the hotel, so it was very easy to get to all the tourist places on Manhattan. One block from the hotel there was a really nice restaurant that had the most delicious bagels. We would definitely stay at this hotel again, if we visit New York another time!

<Content>Great Business Location The Millenium Hilton is a great place to stay if you are having business to do in the Financial District of Manhattan. I like the hotel atmosphere and the location. The service is very friendly and the rooms are above average, both in style and size, compared to other hotels in New York. Ask for a room above the 40th floor if possible and if possible not facing the large construction site on Ground 0. They work there basically 24h/7d and it can get pretty loud.

<Content>Construction noise not bad Paid $180 per night plus taxes on Priceline.Hotel was as expected from other reviews. Pretty much all the rooms face Ground Zero and the construction which was kinda interesting to watch. Room was VERY spacious for any hotel standard forget NYC standards. My #906 was the lowest floor with rooms on it (I asked for this as I heard the wait for elevators was long on the upper floors and I wanted to be lower in case of an emergency). The construction did not bother me, the sound was little more than regular city noise you get anywhere. I did wake up once or twice around 6am cause I think they were moving some big piece of metal around or something, but fell right back asleep. I slept in til around 1030 one day  didnt use the earplugs or need to ask for the noise-reduction machine offered on checkin. There was some noise that came through from the corridor if there were people talking but that was rare as my impression was the hotel was far from full.Had breakfast in the restaurant once, $$ but quite yummy (blueberry pancakes). They were pretty easy about doing substitutions if you wanted. There was also a buffet for $23.95 but it was quite small and no pancakes!Bathroom was great, shampoos etc. were replaced daily. My only annoyance was somehow my phone would only ring in the bathroom, the cordless in the bedroom was connected to some other line which I could use to call out but no incoming calls. Free 800 calls were appreciated. You have to pay for internet use, not sure how much as I had my blackberry.Employee service was excellent, fast checkin. I had some packages delivered and one of the security people worked very hard to locate them as they were initially missing. I also had a bit of a problem locking my door (my fault) and a security person was there within seconds. Someone also came right away to look at the phone issue, although they were not able to fix it and I didnt have time to bother calling again.Accessibility was excellent with the E train being right outside and virtually all other subway lines within blocks. I also walked to the Brooklyn Bridge. Century 21 is right next door too. Cab from Laguardia cost about $30-40 depending on the route  direction as this hotel is further downtown that the midtown hotels.I would recommend Woodbury Common Premium Outlets (you can drive there, about 1h, or take the bus from Port Authority $40 rtn which I did), much better deals than in Manhattan despite July 4 weekend sales.I did not use the pool or any other amenities so cannot comment.

<Content>Awesome value on Priceline First of all, the top line of this review is that, while the hotel quotes its rates between $400 and $500, I was able to snag it for $175 on Priceline. And I'm sure people have gotten it for less before. Amazing deal at that price. At $500, I probably wouldn't have been as happy.I think the reviews about the World Trade Center construction are exaggerated. I had a room facing ground zero and was not disrupted at all. If I turned off the TV and the air conditioner, I was only barely able to hear construction, but not at all if anything in the room was on.The room had a 42 plasma TV which was nice, however there was no HD programming, which I find quite annoying. What's the purpose of having such a great TV if it has a crappy picture?The bath linens and bed were very comfortable. I would have liked a few more outlets, though.

<Content>Very nice downtown hotel! We usually stay at the Courtyard Times Square South when coming to NYC. We opted to stay the night of July 4th at the Millenium Hilton in order to have closer proximity to the fireworks and the South Street Seaport. We had a king room which was about what we expected; not huge but certainly big enough to move around and room for our bags. The room was very clean; had a huge flat-screen tv, a large bathroom with Crabtree  Evelyn toiletries, and a great view of the waterfront/Ground Zero. We were on the 45th floor and still had a little street noise, but that's to be expected in NYC. The construction didn't start until late in the day; possibly because it was a weekend, but again, the noise didn't really bother us. There were earplugs provided in the room for those who are light sleepers; or I suppose you could request a room on the opposite side of the hotel. We didn't take advantage of the pool or restaurants, so I can't comment on those. The bed was comfortable, the shower was great, and I can't think of any reason not to recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great Hotel and great servie This hotel is lovely. It is alittle off the beaten track but has great rooms. Subways are accessible but you need to know where they are. We found the service to be great as well and based on our priceline deal it was affordable. Would love to stay here again.

<Content>HILTON: NEVER EVER AGAIN! THE FOLLOWING IS MY LETTER TO HILTON DESCRIBING OUR ISSUESSS!Hopefully this reaches someone of importance, as my wife and I had the worst hotel experience. Today is our anniversary and we booked a room at the Millenium Hilton with the Romance Package.While booking, I asked online, the 800#, and this hotel directly, to confirm if Guest Certificates were accepted. All three assured they were honored. Trying to check-in at 2:15 pm, the reception desk employee took the Certificates and put a Smoking Room on hold.Since we purchased to the Romance Package, which provides early check-in amongst other amenities, we were disappointed the room was not ready 45 minutes prior to normal check-in. But this wasn鈥檛 the main issue.We dropped bags and couldn鈥檛 freshen up after our trip. When using the hotel bathroom, I waited a while, realizing the street vendors used them to bath in. But even this wasn鈥檛 the main issue.Trying to check-in later that day, the Assistant Front Office Manager, Jacqueline Concepcion, told us they wouldn鈥檛 accept the Guest Certificates. After a long unfruitful conversation, she left to talk with 鈥淭he Director.鈥?Returning she said they still wouldn鈥檛 honor them, adding a Smoking Room was not available, supposedly put on hold, ruining our carefully planned, reconfirmed 鈥淩omantic鈥?Anniversary getaway.My wife and I are extremely disappointed with Millenium and Hilton in general. We are both avid business/personal travelers, taking two vacations a year and often traveling to family out of state. I am disappointed that unless Hilton makes retribution for our poor experience, lack of respect and understanding, and lying to us, we will not stay at nor recommend Hilton. It will be a experience that my wife and I will certainly tell our friends and blogs about, and will be a chain I鈥檒l have my business and wife鈥檚 business decline.

<Content>Nice NY Option Walking into a hotel room and seeing earplugs offered by the management, with an apology letter is not usually a good start, but this is New York and any room near the street has some noise issues. The 24-hour cacaphony is part of NYC. Asking for the highest room available is wise if you have problems with noise.The rooms all seem to overlook Ground Zero, which is undergoing massive construction, but the contruction is presently at street level. Thus, a birds eye view of Ground Zero and a good view of the East River. The rooms are brand spanking new (newly renovated). They are large for NYC. The beds are wonderful. There is Internet access (I guess for a fee, since I use WAN). I found staff helpful and efficient.Various subway routes are within very easy walking distance. The terminus of the E train is here, but others pass through. Because this is Wall Street area, there is not a lot going on at night. Best options seem to be to walk east along the south side of Ground Zero and across the pedestrian overpass. Along the river, there are various options. The better bet in the evening is to take the subway north to Union Square, Times Square, etc., where there are more options. In the morning, you will see the Wall Street workers streaming from the subway like lemmings, all headed the same way.The gym appeared decent, with various machines. I did not eat in the building.Overall, this hotel is ideal for a businessperson who will be doing business in the Wall Street area. Though it is out of the way for most tourism, the subway makes everything proximal in NYC.This area is a bit far from airports. You could take the A train from Kennedy and be very close by. From LaGuardia, you would ideally take the E train, but you have to get to the train stop by taxi ($15) or bus. From Newark, you would need to go to Penn Station, then a subway south.

<Content>You can do better Had 2 rooms for 6 nights. The noise from the construction site at Ground Zero is not the hotels fault, but while the website has warnings (as we discovered later and too late), the hotel booking line did not warn us. The worse thing about the hotel is the inconsistent housekeeping and the slow lifts. Nothing was as good as it should have been for a 4 star property.

<Content>Great Hilton Stayed at the Millenium Hilton for two nights. Nothing but great things. First off the price was great. Using priceline I got a double, corner room with views of the city and the Hudson for under $300 a night. Next the rooms are modern, updated and sharp. The bathroom is very well updated. The beds are heavenly and the room sizes are pretty big fro New York standards. Location is great. Literally located above a subway line. Is located directly across the World Trade Center so there is some construction at stret level. However this wasn't really a problem. Would stay here again.

<Content>noisy elevators i was given a room on the 47th floor looking out over the East River and Brooklyn Bridge. on the first night there was a fantastic firework display to celebrate 125 years of the brooklyn bridge and i got an awesome view from my room. the room was large, great flat screen tv, and kept perfectly clean by the twice daily housekeeping. an ice bucket, bottled water and chocolates was provided daily although i didnt touch the mini-bar because there were warnings everywhere saying it would start to charge you automatically for things if you moved them, whether or not you actually consumed anything. beware! bell staff and front desk staff were very pleasant and efficient. my only problem was my room backed on to one of the elevators (they are high-power and high-speed for reaching the upper floors quickly) and the elevator machinery was quite noisy. but luckily i'm a sound sleeper. the location of the hotel was great, easy to find (at the bottom of the E line of the subway) and easy to get around to other places, battery park for the statue of liberty and ellis island is just a few blocks away, and a short walk in the subway interchange takes you to chambers street for the direct subway (A line) to the AirTrain and kennedy airport. i would recommend this hotel to anyone except if you are on a tight budget, but it was still better value than some other hotels in the city.

Overlooked construction on ground zero but no discernable construction noise for us. Front desk did a great job at check in, found a jr suite and city view room for us to upgrade to! Rate included room service breakfast great stay. Too short

<Author>skhMontreal_Quebec
<Content>terrific hotel, convenient location My mother and I just came back from a 4 night stay at the Hilton and thought it was a beautiful hotel. We had a very spacious room with 2 double beds on the 37th floor facing the city, not the construction. No problems with construction noise at all. The only down side to this area is the amount of construction going on, but the hotel is located right across the street from the subway (or right down the street depending upon your entrance or exit). The dept store Century 21 is located next door, we walked to Battery Park to take a view of the Statue of Liberty and passed other shops on the way. You would think for the price charged, a free breakfast would be included, but I gather that's not the norm in expensive New York. The hotel booked the hop on/hop off bus tour for us, where the pickup was a block away from the hotel. Soho/China Town/Greenwich/Times Square was a mere 10-15 min subway ride or if you kept walking up Broadway, you would eventually walk right into these districts. Very close to Tribeca restaurants. It takes about 2 days to orient yourself on how the subway runs and where the streets are located, but all in all, we were very pleased with this hotel where we were able to use accumulated points (otherwise, no way could we have afforded this).

<Content>Loved it. Super-fast check in, large room, and the best view I've ever gotten. Ask for a room above the 30th floor, you won't be disappointed. I keep hearing complaints about construction, but I never heard a thing. It might have been because I was so high up, but I wouldn't be too concerned. Housekeeping comes by twice a day, and it's close to everything. About 200 steps away is the Chambers St. station, which takes you everywhere. Very safe, very secure. I'd recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Good Hotel but be aware of the construction.... I stayed at the Hudson for business and followed up with the Millenium for pleasure as I stayed the weekend. The Millenium is pretty far. It's in Soho (although, it was very south of Houston Street.). in fact, it's literally beside the World Trade Centre. I could see the construction taking place from my hotel room - interesting but yet sad... There is a lot of construction going on in the area. Contruction at the WTC seemed to be 24/7 and you could hear it (and I believe there was a notice in my room indicating that - no wonder, I got such a good deal on a 4 star hotel in Soho). The room was a very good size (especially, compared to the Hudson). Modern decor (large flat screen) and a good view (WTC, water, etc.). Hotel lobby was decent as was the hotel bar. There is a Century 21 store across the street if you're into cheap shopping with brand names. Not sure if I would stay that far south next time, especially given the construction noise but it was reasonably priced for a 4 star in NY.

<Content>Loved the Hilton.. Both husband and I stopped over in Bangkok for 4 nights on our way to Koi Samui. We were greeted with lovely cool refreshments and cold towels. Check in was quick and easy. Staff were helpful and could not do more for you.As it was our 2nd wedding anniversary, our room was decorated with a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit. On our 1 day stay back from Koi Samui we had a lovely card to welcome us both back to the hotel. We stayed on the executive floor for three nights and one night on the 29th floor. To my surprise, I much preferred the 29th floor, the room was much more spacious and lighting was better within the room than the exec floor's room.We had a lovely time and ate at the restaurant on all four days. I would say the location is perfect and it cost no more than 75 BHT to get to the main districts. We would def go back..

<Content>Enjoyed our stay! We stayed here the first weekend in May for a family wedding that was taking place close by. The gentleman at the front desk was very courteous. In fact, everyone was very nice and made a point to say hello, can I help you? We ate at the Church  Dey restaurant for lunch waiting for the rest of the family to arrive. Lunch was good, but quite expensive, but we were prepared because THIS is New York City!We stayed on the 19th floor and our room was great, roomy and beds were quite comfortable. We had an issue with the room being a bit chilly, but after placing a call to guest services, within a half hour it was corrected and I could thaw! You can see and hear the construction below at the WTC site however, the noise was not a bother at all. Century 21 is next door and OMG it is a shoppers paradise!!!Lots of bargains!! Took the double decker bus for the city tour and it was really great to be able to see everything we normally wouldn't be able to since we usually just take day trips to the city to catch a show.We really enjoyed our stay here and we would stay here again.

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed here over the May Day Bank Holiday. Our room on the 37th floor had a great view out towards the Hudson River with Ground Zero just below. The sun sets with the building in front of you is amazing.We were not disturbed by the building work, although you could sometimes hear it, but it wasn't noisy.Rooms were good, breakfasts as you can imagine were good too. Staff were really nice.The only down side was the lack of local night life, although Pier 17 isn't too far, it wasn't bustling. A good hotel, but I'd probably stay further uptown next time.

<Content>Could be better, could be worse We stayed at the Millenium Hilton this past weekend for the first time. We don't spend much time downtown, but picked the hotel because it was close to an event we were attending. Overall, our stay was pleasant, although it could have been better in some areas.The construction going on at the WTC site makes getting to the hotel a little bit of a challenge, but the signs they've put up are fairly clear. We dropped off the car in the garage, where the garage attendant stood by watching as we unpacked our bags ourselves, without offering to help. Granted, the garage isn't owned or run by the hotel, but for a hotel of this caliper, it was surprising that they didn't have bell staff there to assist visitors. Check in was a snap, and a quick one at that. The woman who helped us was very pleasant, as was the one who answered questions we had later in the afternoon. Our room, on the 41st floor overlooking the WTC site, was very nice. Although we'd been warned about possible construction noise, from that height we didn't have any at all. The room was extremely quiet during our whole stay. My only complaint about the room was that the A/C didn't work well at all. It wasn't hot out by any means, but even with the thermostat set at 65 (the lowest it would go) we were all way too warm all night long. Had we stayed longer we would have asked to have our room changed.The pool was lovely, and the public areas of the hotel were very well maintained. Aside from the A/C issues in our room, the only other area where the hotel was disappointing was in the area of the staff. Granted, we usually stay at the Sofitel in midtown, where the staff are incredibly professional and courteous. But when you're spending almost $400 for a hotel room, you expect exemplary service, and the Millenium Hilton was definitely a let-down in that area. With the exception of the front desk staff, the employees we ran into were OK at best. Not outright rude, but definitely lacking the polish and professionalism I'd expect at a hotel like this. So as I said, overall our experience here was OK. I don't know that I'd stay here again, though, mostly because for what the room cost, I don't think the service was quite up to par.

<Content>Great stylish hotel w/all the amenities Our check-in happened in a matter of minutes, no problem at all. The room was exactly as it looked on the website, nice clean modern design, with a river view. Bed was very comfortable, staff pleasant, and the pool/sauna beautiful. Easy access to subways and a short walk to Tribeca. Would definitely stay here again--next time will remember to bring my swimsuit!

<Content>Pretty good the second time I stayed at this hotel on the weekend of April 18-20. This was my second visit. My previous stay was in March 2008 when I paid $169, and I was a bit shocked that the rate was double this time -- but I guess this is not out-of-line for other similar hotels in Manhattan. Last time the construction noise wasn't a problem ( I was on a high floor), but this time they put me on a lower floor (26) and I could hear the droning all night long. I found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. For example, I was looking for a newspaper at 7 AM Saturday morning: the gift shop hadn't opened yet, so the bellman went on a crusade and brought me back a paper. One small criticism of the restaurant: I am very picky when it comes to my morning coffee and the coffee there isn't very good -- it tastes like it is made in one of those huge steel containers you see in cafeterias. As others have noted, there should be free wireless internet in the rooms given the high room charge. I like the location of the hotel, as the financial district is quiet on the weekends and I enjoyed going for a jog at nearby Battery Park. All in all, I would recommend the Millenium.

<Content>Noisy! I stayed here for 3 nights in February for a work trip. The hotel is located right by Ground Zero and although fairly nice, the biggest problem is the construction noise! They work until 11pm and start again 5 am in the morning. It's impossible to sleep through! Rooms are small but there's nothing wrong with them. The bed was comfy and you have all necessities in the room; desk, chair, large TV etc. You know what you get when you book with Hilton. I had breakfast at the restaurant one morning, it was OK but fairly basic. I had room service a few times and never really liked my meal. Eat out! The lobby bar is quite lively but drinks are fairly expensive.

<Content>Better Than Expected! My biggest concern about this hotel was the noise complaints. I'd read more than a few reviews about the construction noise due to the WTC location. IT WAS NEVER AN ISSUE!!! One review stated that it was non-stop noise. That was not the case. There was never a disturbance. The location was great. There were several subway locations around the hotel. We bought day passes and used the subway to go everywhere! There were an abundance of stores and eateries. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Very nice hotel; difficult location for tourists The room was great--very clean, larger than I expected, with luxurious bed linens and a comfy king bed. Main problem was with the heating/AC unit--it ran constantly and was very loud. The hum of the A/C drowned out any construction sounds from Ground Zero, but we could still hear water running through the pipes from adjacent rooms. They really should have put some better soundproofing in.Staff were polite and helpful. They held our bags on the last day for no charge. We didn't eat at the restaurant, but the room service and mini bar prices were quite honestly outrageous. I could go down to the entrance and get a hot dog and can of soda for $4, or get a can of soda from the minibar for $6! There is not a whole lot of food near the hotel, so we tended to eat in midtown before heading back to the hotel.The next time we come to NYC we will stay closer to midtown. It became a pain to have to take the subway everywhere especially since they were working on some of the lines we needed over the weekend so we had to change lines a few times. But for a business traveler I think the hotel fits the bill.

<Content>Good weekend base I booked this hotel through priceline but it was a very good find. We were facing the construction site at the WTC but the noise was never noticeable. From the 51st floor we could see Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. The room itself was quite comfortable and had a great bed. Anytime we used the guest services, we were met with a quick and friendly response. The hotel was very convenient to the East Village and Lower East Side thanks to the subway and even walking if you like to pound the pavement. I wouldn't pay rack rate here but with priceline or another sale site it was a good deal.

<Content>Third time is NOT a charm This is the 3rd time I have stayed at the hotel and I like it less and less each time. I'll start with the good and get to the bad:good:- close to subway stops (the E which takes you too and from JFK is right outside and you can catch other blue, green and red lines train in very close proximity)- large tv in rooms (I think it is a must for hotels to have a flat screen tv, especially for over $300 a night)- very clean (housekeeping was awesome and didn't bug us once)now the bad:- I had booked two rooms on check-in. One for me and my girlfriend and the second for my two buddies. When we checked in we requested a king for myself and girlfriend and two beds for my buddies. they said I had called and requested a single bed for both rooms. This never happened. My problem is they lied about me calling instead of telling me they ran out of single beds- they were doing construction inside the hotel and it was a mess. Plus the noise was absolutely horrible from 9 to 6. Unbearable to be in the room, couldn't hear the tv loud. And that was from the floor below us.- out of our 3 visits we have never gotten a king bed even though we request every time and they only show king as on option on the website.- the air conditioner did not work well and stayed around 70 degrees which was hard for me to sleep in.- no GOOD food around the hotelI really want to like this hotel more, but there are much better options to staying in New York. I would probably pick this hotel as a last resort, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here.

<Content>Rooms are the only nice thing about the hotel Staff is unfriendly, I was never greeted once leaving or entering the hotel. No Bellman present to flag cabs, or help opening the heaviest door possible. The hotel is out of line for charging for internet in the rooms, the lobby wireless and even the business centre!!! You cannot use the computers in the business centre until you swipe your credit card. I found this very pathetic of the hotel, not to provide your guests with computer access. I booked this hotel on hotwire as well, claiming it was in the SoHo area. Do not trust hotwire, so far from soho. It's in the finnancial district.

<Content>Fantastic experience - see New York at its best ! I went to New York for a trip in December 2005 and had a great time at the Millenium Hilton. We stopped on the 39th floor and had a breathtaking view of Ground Zero. The hotel was the closest hotel to the Twin Towers and the staff are always keen to tell you stories. There is even a rescued flag framed in the reception area from the building that was salvaged on the terrible attacks in September 2001. Make sure that you ask for a front facing room as the views are simply stunning. The views from the rear will encompass Brooklyn Bridge. We didnt get chance to use the swimming pool facility but did enjoy the breakfast everyday which had the most delicious muffins I have tasted . . . ever! and you can eat as many as you want :) Nearby there is a underground station which is accessible to most places with ease, the hotel is situated just a short walk to the harbour front where you can see the Statue of Liberty. There are several restaurants nearby but dont make the mistake of ordering a starter as you wont eat the main . . . food was fab, but there was just too much of it - even for a strapping 6ft 5 lad like me. The staff in the hotel were all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble, when I ordered Champagne to the room it was there within minutes and there was never any fuss. If you are a shopaholic be sure to check out the Department Store next to the hotel 'Century 21' I think the name was - loads of bargains to be grabbed, fantastic prices and lots of choice. The hotel was also a short walk from Wall Street as it is situated in the heart of the financial district so there tends to be an after-work crowd in the hotel bar at night and that is where you can really soak up the atmosphere and mingle with the locals. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable trip - lovely hotel - the only thing I wouldnt recommend is spending New Years Eve in Times Square, although its nice to say you have done it you cant see much and you need to start queuing at 3 - 4pm in the afternoon in the freezing cold . . and if you need the toilet, well you lose your place! Still I cant complain, an unforgettable experience which has left me with fantastic memories . . enjoy!

<Content>Loved the price, hated the noise Avoid this hotel if you're a light sleeper (unless you get it for 100/night like we did on Priceline). Construction at the Ground Zero site is constant and noisy, although my husband kept saying what noise, I don't hear anything.

<Content>average corporate hotel, lost of construction, good room service I stayed at this hotel for two days. It was convenient to the business meetings I was attending. The check-in took a while -- the clerk (only one, despite a long line of people waiting to check in) was nice.The hallway was covered in plastic (the hotel is undergoing construction) and looked very industrial/non-plush. Not impressive at all. I got a king room on the 43rd floor (4306) with a view of the WTC site, the river, and the city beyond. The room was small, but the furnishings were modern. I liked the bed linens and great pillows (I think I used all 6!), and a flat screen TV was a nice touch also. I also liked that there was a coffee maker with two cups. I always like to have a hot beverage and don't necessarily want to order room service every time I need a cup of tea.There was an alarm clock (not too hi-tech), and the obligatory mini-bar with a selection of very expensive drinks. One of the drawers was taken up by snacks (I tried the pretzels -- 1oz bag for $4.50! - but that's to be expected, and they were fresh).The bathroom, also small, had a weird toilet with very low water level and low flow of water in general. The shower head and the fixtures were not too modern.The toiletries by Crabtree  Evelyn were pleasant smelling. The cleaning person refilled all of them (unfortunately, no cotton balls or Qtips) the next dayI wish there was a bathrobe and slippers! The safe was useful, though.The gym was adequate -- much nicer than I've seen in some other hotels, with several cardio machines, weights, water, towels and magazines. I also wanted to try the heated pool that looked relaxing, but it was rather crowded with families/children and I decided to pass. The business center was inadequate, in my view -- you could not even acces the internet for free. What kind of business hotel is this?I thought that room service (I had 2 dinners and 1 breakfast) was good -- the food came when it should have and was fresh and tasty, but the menu choices were fairly limited, especially if you don't eat meat/want something healthy.I would recommend the shrimp wrap (I had it twice!) and the heathy breakfast (eggwhite frittata was beautifl -- large, hot, full of veggies, and just delicious; juice, hot drink, and fruit cup).Finally, it was odd not to have the option of checking out via the TV, like most other hotels (even of much lower 'grade') have. I got a paper bill under the door overnight (the old fashioned way) and had to call the front desk to check out.Overall, this was okay, but I won't be disappointed if I never stay here again.

<Content>Great Staff, Location, Rooms, Loved it! My teenage son and I flew in for a short business trip  to see the parade. To start off, the doormen begin your stay with a warm greeting. The front desk staff are friendly  helpful. The room was amazing. Spacious, clean, beautifully equipped. They do warn you at the desk if you pull something out of the fridge, that you will be charged. If you put it back, they'll credit you. There isn't anything they won't do to make your stay pleasent. It's just too bad we weren't in the hotel, but to sleep. We ordered room-service, which was extremely good. I hate reading reviews, cause it's hard to chose a hotel in NYC. I always wait a month to write a review, incase I had a bad experience. Most people don't. It's easiest to blame the hotel. I'm there every month and try to stay in a different location. This hotel is a hop on the subway to everything. Subway is right across the street. It's right next to Century 21. My Favorite store. The view from our room was amazing. We could see every part of Ground Zero. It was important for me to have my son see the devastion that was caused. Everything was amazing: the bedding, cleanliness, staff, location, all of it. With the exception of the conceierge. He would rather help the business men, then a lady  her teenage son. Don't worry about the construction noise. They put you on a high floor and we didn't even hear it.

<Content>Best of Downtown Stayed at the Millenium Hilton for only one night, February 2. Booked directly through Hilton by phone. Easy 7-10 minute taxi ride from Penn Station, or there is a subway stop next to the hotel. This hotel is directly across the street from the Path Station and Ground Zero. Also, across the side street from St. Paul's Church (built in 1766. This church was where George Washington went to pray after his inauguration. It is also the church who's amazing stained glass windows didn't even crack as the towers-across the street-collpased. It was a relief/aide station during the months following the attacks. There is also an old cemetary in front dating back to the Revolutionary War). Trinity Church, South Street Seaport  Museum, Battery Park, Tribecca, City Hall, Chinatown, etc. are also nearby. My 8 year old daughter and I had a Corner King on the 37th floor. I have to say, from check in to check out, we were both treated with great respect and courtousy. We were offered ear plugs or a sound machine if the noise from ground zero became too loud. We didn't need either of these things; however, there was a pounding noise from the site which ended at midnight and began again at 6 am. (just in time for us to see the awsome sun rise over the statue of liberty!)The view from our room was amazing. The windows are almost floor to ceiling. Out one window we could see the Brooklyn Bridge and Dumbo. Out the other window we could see Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. We watched the ferries go by and the circle line, as well as some cruise ships on their way back home.The beds were very comfortable. The room had a large flat screen plasma TV, alarm clock radio, two phones (one in the bathroom), a Lavazza Coffee Maker with tea set up as well, and internet access (for a fee). There is not fan in the bathroom but it was very nice and the name brand toiletries were top qualitiy. The ceiling in this room was large by current standards. Don't open the minibar unless you want something...it is on sensors and if you touch it the computer thinks you bought it. One wonderful thing that this hotel has that many others in Manhattan don't, is a pool. It is located on the 5th floor next to the fitness room and the spa (where you can opt for a massage after walking around downtown all day!)The decor of the restaurant and bar area were modern but not large. Windows overlook ground zero on one side and St. Paul's Church on the other. My daughter liked watching the cars and people go by outside below us while we ate dinner. She was waving at people who actually waved back at her. That made her day. Be advised that they do have a children's menu but they do not offer substitutions. Also, if you don't want your burger rare, say so! The menu had a lot to choose from. Something for almost all tastes.I would definately stay here again if I needed to be downtown. The reception was wonderful, room beautiful, pool fun and food good. There is also a starbucks downstairs and a real hot dog vendor around the corner. There is a lot to do downtown so take advantage of this wonderful area of Manhattan. Check it out and stay at the Millenium Hilton!

<Content>OK Business Hotel I'm writing this sitting at the desk in my room on the 54th floor. The view is awesome!I just wanted to speak about the noise from the WTC construction site: it's not th脿t bad! As a matter of fact, it hasn't bothered me at all and I suppose some guests are more sensible than others. If you live in a city -as I do-, it's the same noise as you have at home. It's called city noise...Overall the hotel is OK, staff is friendly, rooms are OK (a bit tired, though...), swimming pool is nice (not comparable to the Peninsula where I usually stay) and the food is good. I choose this hotel to get rid of my miles on my airline card... Location is ideal for people coming here for business. For compulsive shoppers (counting myself in...) it's far from the places where you can flex the plastic (not counting Century21 next door if you like this kind of shop, but worth seeing it and if you have the patience, buying stuff...), or from the West End.So, good hotel, but no comparison with the Millenium Hilton from Bangkok, which is WAY better...

<Content>Great views and beds! We stayed for 2 nights and had a twin room on the corner of floor 39 with great views although we were overlooking ground zero which was noisy but fine with ear plugs.Beds v comfy, great shower and tea and coffee making.No fan in the bathroom which was very steamy, but overall, great especially with star bucks just downstairs!

<Content>Good experience Room overlooked ground zero. Asked for and received sound machine to cover the construction noise immediately after check in. That combined with the comfy beds gave me the best nights sleep Ive had in a long time. The room and contents were agreeable although the dust behind dressers and above showers might be a problem for those with allergies. You can do allot in one day in New York without going far. We walked a few blocks to Battery Park and took a boat to Ellis Island. On the way back to the hotel we toured the American Indian Museum and shopped the stores at the Century 21 building next door. Overall its convenient to the sites and a nice hotel.

<Content>The hotel is lucky to have Angie and Vivian... I've stayed at the Millenium Hilton on two other occasions, and both were good experiences except for the front desk and some of the noise from the WTC construction. I didn't mean to select the neighborhood when I was putting my bid in on Priceline, and I also didn't mean to put in the dollar amount I did 鈥?I'd been working way too much for a month before so I guess I needed a break more than I thought. Anyway, I wound up with the Millenium Hilton accepting my bid.I immediately called asking to be on the non-WTC-facing side. However when I got there I was confirmed for WTC-facing. Angie explained that the king beds are all WTC-facing. She offered a queen bed on the opposite side, but I needed a king for this trip. She moved us to floor 49 鈥?and she was so friendly, patient, and informative, we just loved her.We ordered room service that night and the burgers were amazing. Salad not so great, but the burgers had filled us up anyway (we ordered way too much for two people). It was expensive, but typical of room service and very tasty.Easy checkout via the internet tv.

<Content>The views are simply out of this world!! The standards in this hotel are simply superb. We had a corner mini suite on the 50th floor looking out on to the Hudson River and with the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in plain view as well.The room was immaculately clean, with tea  coffee making facilities and two huge TV's. The check-in was super with a real eagerness to help. Everyone was very apologetic about the construction noise (the hotel is opposite 'ground zero') but the views and service more than outweighed the limited noise we experienced. However noise will become more and more of an issue as the rebuilding work continues. This hotel has a super location downtown - you are next door to Century 21 only a few minutes walk to Battery Park (and the Liberty/Ellis Island ferries) a few minutes to South Street Seaport and the subway is right at the hotel door for midtown and uptown trains.My only criticism - and I stress only, is the concierge arranging transfers back to the airport - ours was a yellow cab with no meter running so the journey back to the airport cost far more than the journey from the airport. Insist on a metered taxi at all times.A wonderful stay and a hotel I would definately return to.

<Content>Great property but be aware of the noise You can count on the Millenium Hilton quality at this Financial District property - great amenities, cleanliness, friendly and helpful staff. We were lodged in a junior suite on the 28th floor with wonderful views of the city facing west, including the Hudson River, and to the north, looking uptown. We also got a great room rate, but beware that the hotel sits right next to the giganic construction project going on right now at Ground Zero and they are working just about 7X24. The hotel will supply you with ear plugs (didn't really help me) and the option to obtain a white noise machine (with a $200 deposit refundable when you return the machine). At some times during the night, construction noise can get quite loud. The room was wonderful - good space with large windows, great bedding and very comfortable mattress. The bathroom was spacious, with a large vanity granite counter. Housekeeping was always available to make the pull-out sofa bed, even at 1:00 am. The hotel bar on the 3rd floor is so-so in the way of what an average hotel bar would look like. I would love to give this hotel a big thumbs up, but would do so with reservation since the contruction noise was very audible and at times irritating in the middle of the night.

<Content>OK hotel, but A LOT OF NOICE and rude staff The Millenium Hilton is An OK hotel with VERY sleek and clean rooms and great views of NYC if you get a room high enough. However, please note the following: There is A LOT of noice due to the construction at ground zero - so make sure you get a room on a high floor away from the construction. If you can not get this guaranteed then stay away - even earplugs will not stop the noice which starts at 05:00 and stops at about midnight.And do expect typical NYC rudeness - also from the front desk and staff. I got the impression that they would rather not have us there at all.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel in Lower Manhattan - Top Marks!! We booked to stay at the Millenium Hilton on Church Street in Lower Manhattan NYC for a 3 night long weekend (7th to 10th December 2007) to celebrate my 40th birthday. The hotel is out of the hustle and bustle of the main attractions such as Times Square so the traffic  pedestrian noise levels are non-existent from the hotel rooms. We were welcomed by very polite and cheerful hotel staff and found our room to have an incredible view over Ground Zero on Floor 53 (of 54) ... we could also see the Statue of Liberty from our room - east facing rooms look over the East River towards the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. Construction of the Freedom Tower which is to stand in the place of the former Twin Towers is to be ready in 2010. Although friends who had visited several weeks before us had told us that construction noise could only be heard from 8am to 9pm we found this to be different on our visit. Extended hours are being worked in order that the Freedom Tower is finished on time. We could hear construction noise (even on the 53rd floor) from 5:30am to 11:30pm. A letter of apology from the hotel management was on our room desk the following day and to be honest the noise was not really a problem so do not be put off - just be aware of it if you are travelling here.We bought the hop on hop off bus pass (All Loops Tour) but only used it once as the subway and the taxis were very cheap and easy to use. Also the top of an open-top bus in December is VERY cold so you don't want to spend too much time up there! The subway station starts and ends directly opposite the hotel. The fare is $2 per person per trip and this will get you to 42nd Street (A, C and E Trains) and a block away from Times Square and all it's entertainment  shopping in less than 15 minutes. Don't take with you any preconceived ideas about the subway - it is cheap, clean, roomy, quick and VERY safe. We will use this method of transport around New York on every future trip now. The hotel concierge are superb so make sure you use them and their vast knowledge of the area. We were advised on transport, restaurants, bars, shopping and local sites. If you stay at the Hilton Millenium you MUST go into St Paul's Chapel next door where memorials and tributes are made to those brave people who lost their lives and loved ones in the 9/11 attacks. It is a very humbling, moving and peaceful place - we were very touched by this experience and were priveleged to have spent time here.There is a GREAT deli around the corner on Vesey Street. Breakfast and lunch are delicious and very cheap. Try the hot pastrami with mustard  pickle on rye - simply delicious. Please look at the photographs on the walls in the deli too - again some very moving pictures taken from 9/11 in the deli sheltering fire and police crews - very thought provoking. You can also find a superb French restaurant on the east side of the hotel - from memory I think it was on John Street but I can't remember the restaurant name - you'll know it when you see it. We had a bottle of wine and butcher's cut steaks which were divine all for $80 - quality!In summary the Hilton Millenium is outstanding. Rooms are very comfortable, clean and have all the requirements expected from visitors including entertainment system (huge Plasma TV / Playstation / WiFi / Tea  Coffee / Ice / Mini-Bar, etc.). Room service was superb  delicious as well as very reasonably priced for a hotel. I have read many reviews on this site and find it a little fickle that people mark this hotel down because they see Ground Zero as a construction site or that they were kept awake by people arguing in the hallway - this is no contribution to the rating of this hotel. We rate the hotel as very highly recommended. We would definitely stay here again without hesitation and hope that our review helps you make your decison as to where to stay in this wonderful city! Enjoy!!!

<Content>excellent we travelled to new york for my 21st birthday and stayed in the millenium hilton as soon as we got there the hotel staff couldnt do enough for you. we were taken upstairs by the bell boy on the 52nd floor the view was amazing!!! massive plasma t.v big comfortable room with the best bed you will ever sleep in!! we didnt eat in the hotel but looked nice on the 5th floor. we thought that we may be looked down upon as we are younger and have in other nice hotels but there was non of this from any staff in this hotel which was nice!there is a outlet called centry 21 next to the hotel in you are from ebgland and like tk max then you will like that but no my sort of thing so didnt buy anything.the subway is next to the hotel but is not as nice as the london tube but is handy to get into the centre. and get a taxi back.the only thing with this hotel is the work that is going on outside the front of the hotel on ground zero but we had a letter in our room on arrival from the manager apoligising for the noise and offering ear plugs if needed but me and my partner dont struggle to sleep and we were high up believe me when you are walking for miles around new york and get back to your big bed the noise is not a problem you could sllep through anything!!we loved this hotel and would personaly give it 5*!

<Content>Great hotel, not the most interesting area Very nice hotel, but they are a little unlucky with the noise at the moment. The WTC reconstruction is behind schedule and the constucters are being fined for every day they fall behind on certain deadlines. This is not the hotels fault though. They provide sound machines (not enough of them though) and ear plugs. Not much more they can do. That said I would wait a few months before going to stay there as the work is almost 24*7 right now.The room was great, as was the bar, room service, reataurant...everything you want from the hotel. Of particular note, the ear poppingly fast lifts. I found the staff to be very friendly and sympathetic about the noise and as our room was not ready on arrival they treated us to free drinks at the bar (which more than makes up for it).I didn't like the area the hotel is in too much. I was aware it was a business area but I guess since 9/11 a lot of other businesses closed as a result and even on a weeknight, there are fewer options than elsewhere so you may need to travel..thankfully most of the metro routes seem to cross around here so its a good location if you are planning to use the train system a lot.Overall I was very satisfied. I'd probably try another area next time but would recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Nice hotel but do not stay here whilst WTC construction is still in process I searched many a website to find the perfect hotel for our 5 night stay in New York and I eventually settled on the Millenium Hilton. The photos on the website looked very nice and the value for money was good given our 5 night stay included New Years Eve. I had no doubts really that the hotel would be fine given the Hilton name.The hotel itself is very nice, clean and with stylish decor and first impressions are very good.Ours problems however started at check in. I had pre-booked a king room with a city view only to be told there were none currently available, so we had 2 choices, wait for a room to become available later in the afternoon (it was 4pm when we tried to check in) or take a lower room. We decided to wait for our room with a view that we wanted.We were pretty tired after the very long journey but sat patiently in the hotel bar for our room. After an hour we went back to the desk and were allocated our room on the 48th floor. The room was very nice with a view right over what was the WTC and the Statue of Liberty in the distance. I was perfectly aware that there was construction works going on prior to booking the hotel but presumed the works would stop in the evening and continue in the morning and as I am someone who sleeps well I did not think it would pose a problem 鈥?how wrong could I be? I decided to have a quick kip before heading out for something to eat on the 1st evening, I laid on the bed for 2 hours between 5 and 7 and didn鈥檛 sleep a wink due to the very loud construction noises. On our way out for something to eat we asked at reception what time the works would stop, we were told maybe 11pm sometimes earlier sometimes later (not very helpful) we asked for some ear plugs which they appeared to have plenty of.The long and short of it is that the construction went on ALL night and we did not sleep a wink, even with the ear plugs and a pillow on my head. We phoned down to reception in the morning and asked to be moved to a quieter room or alternatively to relocate us to another hotel and we had no intention of staying where we were and having 5 sleepless nights.We took our luggage down to reception and went out for the day. We were told we would be allocated another room. We returned to the hotel at 8pm to find we had not yet been allocated a room, after about 陆 an hour they found us a new room. It had twin beds and no city view but the room was quiet and we were too tired to argue the difference and the receptionists did not seem too bothered anyway. I intend to take this further with Hilton now we have returned home.On the positive side as before the actual hotel is very nice. Ideally located for down town Manhattan with subways on the doorstep costing $2 for a single journey anywhere in Manhattan. New York is a fantastic place, everything you think it will be and a place you have to visit at least once. The shopping is amazing and very cheap in comparison to the UK, there are many bargains to be had. The food is also fantastic, we ate in Fish in Greenwich Village and had whole lobster for 拢15.New York at this time of year was very very busy, I would definitely return again although probably at a quieter time of year. If you go when its busy expect to queue for everything.With regards to the hotel I would definitely not stay here again until after the construction has finished and would not recommend to anyone to stay there at the moment.

<Content>Great Location, shame about the noise and elevators! I stayed for 4 nights at end of Dec 07. The location of the hotel was great - I much preferred being here to Midtown. I had a view of the water and Statue of Liberty, plus the construction site at WTC. This was one of the only downsides - I was on the 48th floor, and the noise from the site went on 24 hours and you could hear it at that level so this hotel is no good if you are a light sleeper. The room was pleasant, clean and comfortable. The staff were ok - not rude nor overly polite. The best thing was the proximity to all of the subway systems which take you anywhere in Manhattan, plus you could walk up to Tribeca and SoHo for restaurants, bars and shopping, which were way cooler than anything Midtown has to offer. Only other downside - the elevators get very crowded between 9-10am when all of the tourists are trying to get out and about, to the point of being dangerously overloaded with people trying to squeeze in having waited for 20 mins, the management should supervise this....

<Content>new york,millenium hilton Arrived at millenium hilton early hours of morning 29th dec after being on a bus for 2 hours, get the subway much quicker,we did going back to airport at end of stay, checked in and we had booked a city view above 30th floor, we were given level 25! i said to the guy behind desk that we had booked city view above level 30, he said one momment and about 10min later said we were now on 49th floor,which was much better, thou the guy wasn,t sorry, bit rude really and no smile!got to the room and that was great, lovely view. thou we would get a decent nights sleep ready for a day of shopping! WTC works very noisy and did not stop till new years eve, they worked 24 hours a day and even being on 49th floor could still hear, very loud. they are a month behind on finishing.went to woodbury outlet, not great, some bargins but mostly last years stock and not many sizes! busy too and 2 half hours on the bus coming back!Went to empire state building and that was another 2 half hours wait and every one pushes in, finely got to the top and great view but all the standing around waiting to get up top take the edge of it, one good thing when we got up there it was snowing.could,t really find places to eat and had mexican twice, which was nice,times square was just mad and it really is a city that doesn,t sleep.we had booked a new years eve party with JOONBUG a cruise on the half moon, well it states cocktail/semi formal men attire. i brought a lovely cocktail dress and my partner wore a suit, i could have gone in jeans and t-shirt!food was rubbish and drinks were in plastic cups and 8$ each!music was good to start and then some right rubbish was played and was really loud too!another thing tickets said be there at 8 don,t be late, we did,t move from marine till nearly 11pm and then going down river towards fire works for new year he was going to fast that the boat was going forward across river so unless u were out front on deck you could,t see fire works! not what i thou it be.another thing don,t touch the food or drink in mini bar because you will be charged for it and its not cheap, food is expenses too, but if do fancy some food there is 24 hour service which is good, this is also a none smoking hotel, but there,s warm heaters outside.this was 1 of my dreams to come to new york and i,ve done it now, but i would,t do again and would,t come back to this hotel untill WTC works are finished.

<Content>Christmas at the Hilton Last year - Oct 2006 my family and I stayed at the Hilton Millenium, the visit was really good, I would have given it a 9/10. But our second visit December 21st - 27th 2007; sorry Hilton, but you have let your sides down. I would give you a 3/10 on this visit. For starters, I had booked the room almost a year in advance, I requested the 53rd floor with a city view. I got the 53rd floor but no city view. After a few phone calls, I got the 45th w/city view. I thought a year in advance and with a request like that - easy to plan. My children were with me (21,19,16) and I wanted them to see the breathtaking skylines over Christmas. We did have a king sized junior suite, nice size, shower worked, maid service good, bed made, clean towels and room kept tidy. One thing that really got me.. I must be honest here too, the bar staff in particular (main bar and resturant bar 3rd floor) were not friendly (anyone with an ice pic?) - more so on the rude side. I have travelled with Hilton for business throughout Europe, service was better, staff approachable and friendly. But overall... Would I go back? No. I like to feel a bit more of a welcome. I suggest Hilton management to get the bar staff on a customer relationship course. And teach them how to serve with a smile.....

<Content>Not impressed! I booked this Hotel as it looked very nice on the website. I e-mailed the Hotel to let them know I needed a twin room away from the lifts, preferbly in the corner. To my disappointment, we got a double bed, next to the lift and in front of the construction work so did not sleep at all. The staff told us they were fully booked so could not give us another room and totally ignored the fact that I had got an email confirmation saying we would get a twin room. I asked them what time the construction work would finish, and they said at 10pm! well, this went on the WHOLE night so they lied to us. I was extremely disappointed with their attitude, the standard of the Hotel and lack of knowledge. I would never recommend this Hotel to anyone.

<Content>Bad first impression. My partner had secretly arranged with the staff to have a bottle of champagne, champagne glasses that were sent over from Bloomingdales, and two tux's to be in the room when we arrived. He even told them what time we were to arrive. Upon check in we were told our room might be ready, and I told them that's ok, we can check our bags, walk around and come back later. Instead, we were sent up to our room. This was simple...the front desk could have stalled by asking us to have a seat in the bar, but didn't. We got to our room  it wasn't 30 seconds when the champagne arrived. The glasses  tux's arrived some time later...seperatly... mind you, they had been sitting downstairs at the concierge all morning. We were given a verbal appology by the manager, but you can't undo something like that and expect it to be enough. They could have comped the champagne, but we didn't pursue it. I had high hopes for this property by reading all of the postings, but the hotel blew it for me big time.

<Content>It needs to be closed 1 The hotel is uninhabitable. The 24 hour a day construction noise at Ground Zero is so bad, one will not be able to sleep without drugs. THE hotel web page talks about neighborhood construction, but says nothing about the nonstop noise. The hotel should be closed until the work is done.

<Content>I want to buy the pillows! So comfy/modern/nice! I stayed for 3 nights in June 07 and this hotel was wonderful! Very fancy, clean, modern, and spacious. I loved how I could plug in my iPod to the alarm clock so I could listen to my own music. The flat panel TV is nice, furniture is modern. The best part were the pillows! I actually looked up online and saw that you could buy them. Expensive pillows - but I want a couple still!!I only would complain about the construction at Ground Zero so there was noise all night but I could still sleep. I felt very safe here but at 3am there isn't anything to eat unless you want to walk a few blocks (which I wouldn't, as a small female). The subway that is very close didn't take me to my friend's place in ChinaTown/Little Italy so that was kind of a pain sometimes, but we took taxis. This is an excellent hotel for the financial district and ground zero visitations.

<Content>Elegant bargain Lovely hotel, clean and new due to recent remodelling, which seems to be completed. (As of 12/07 there is some construction on the east side of the hotel, but it does not affect hotel access.) Breathtaking views of Hudson River and WTC site. Close to Tribeca, subway, and steps from train station at WTC.You can get great deals directly from their website, probably to build up business again after remodel. Highly recommended.

<Content>excellent stay We just returned from our first trip to NYC and stayed the last 3 days at the Millenium Hilton, and we overly pleased with the stay. We had stayed in Times Square for the first 2 nights of our stay and were a little worried about leaving that area for another hotel.But we were more than pleased with our choice. The hotel is a Hilton, and that speaks for itself. Very modern , clean and staff very more than willing to help on any occasion.We booked a room through Hotwire for $244/night and felt that was a great price for that hotel in NYC at that time of the year.We had a deluxe room with a king bed ( as promised) and had no complaints whatsoever about the room. It did overlook ground zero, and it was a bit noisy on some mornings but we were on the 21st floor and what we heard at that level was nothing to complain about. Yes there was some noise, but nothing that you may even notice.We didn't eat at the restaurant but we heard that it was very good.They have a great pool, and fitness center. The business center had all the amenities , but charged for use of the internet, (perhaps in my opinion the only negative thing about the hotel). FOr such a hotel for this price, I think internet access should be available at no extra charge.Staff were great and answered all of our many questions about NYC and tried to help in whatever way they could.The location of the hotel is in the downtown area, which was not a concern for us, as the subway was very convenient and got us to where we needed to be in 10 minutes.Overall a fabulous time in NYC and at this hotel. Would definately recommend this hotel, and we would stay there again

<Content>exceedingly average The hotel is opposite Ground zero, so great location for looking around Manhattan. Unfortunately there is a lot of building work near the hotel, the noise of which could be heard in our hotel room despite being on a high floor. We were also woken up in the middle of the night by a couple arguing in the hallway! The hotel food is also very expensive, with a chocolate bar from the mini bar costing about $6! Staff not too friendly either. Not what I expected from a Hilton hotel!

<Content>A good altenative if the price is right We needed to go to NYC for what we now realize is major tourist season. We tried all means possible to get a nice hotel for under $500-600/night for a weekend in between Thanksgiving and Xmas to no avail.We decided to blow our entire hotel point account on 2 nights at a different hotel which was not ideal but it got us there. I continued to search however, for some break though or last minute deal. Hotwire was listing a 4 star hotel in Soho for $249. Bingo! I examined the description (which mentioned a pool) and searched to find that the only 4* hotel in Soho with a pool was the uber-hip Gansevoort. I jumped at the chance and booked it, only find, out after committing, that the reservation was for the Millennium Hilton.We were quite disappointed (I'd even say a bit mad) since although this hotel is South of Houston....it is no way Soho.We have had many opportunities to stay here in the past but declined. But....we sucked it up and checked in and wrote it off to it's only a place to sleep and shower.I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised. The proximity to the subway and path trains made it an incredibly convenient location. Since we are Gold members, we were upgraded to a room with a fantastic view of all downtown and the river. Sunset was spectacular. It was fascinating to watch the activity going on in the rebuilding of the WTC across the street. We checked in to a decent sized, modern and clean room with nothing really to complain about. The staff was helpful and friendly.While we did just sleep and shower here on our busy weekend, I would consider staying here again if the price was prohibitive at some of our more favorite locations.

<Content>Very nice NYC hotel After staying at 20 hotels in NYC over the years - The Hilton Millenium rates very high. Great location for Chinatown - Lil Italy - Battery Park - Chelsea - Soho - lower Manhattan. We had a standard room - very nice- ave sized. You typically cannot go wrong with Hilton - always nice and comfortable. The location basically overlooks the construction at Ground Zero. One might complain about the construction noise - very little for us. Did not have time for fitness / pool / or restaurant. Pool looked nice on their photo page. The staff was very nice and cabs were easy to come by. There is a train station across the street (Ground Zero - path). Cab - $15 to Midtown.

<Content>nothing less than superb! We stayed here for my 40th birthday and it was nothing less than superb!I was our second trip to NYC. We'd previously stayed in the equally excellent Fitzpatricks on lexington in June '06 but their December rates could not match the value we got at the Millenium - five nights for 鈧?00, less than $200/night! Worth every penny!Victor, the extremely efficient guy who took our reservation ensured we got one of the few (14) smoking rooms of all of which are on the 54th floor and ours had a excellent view over Jersey with an eerie eagle eyed perspective over the WTC site. The location in Downtown NY is close to Wall street, right next door to Century 21 and two mins walk from Abecrombie  Fitch which made shopping so easy and cab fairs up town are cheap.Check in was instant! The door men are first class, everyone of them friendly and funny but the numerous concergie's vary. One guy, Joe, was condescending and rude and managed to mess up our dinner reservation for my big four oh but another guy who's name slips my mind gave us excellent advice on where to catch the Arsenal V Chelsea match - Nevada Smiths on 3rd ave between 11th  12th which had an absolutley brillaint atmoshpere - packed with chanting fans of both persuasions, half of them expats and amazingly, many avid new york soccer fans! We ate breafast and dinner in the hotel both of which were excellent with super service. The bar staff are great, especially the retired cop guy who didnt fail to set us up a freebie after several rounds and tips. They talk freely about the horendous events of 9/11 when incredibly the hotel survived any serious structural damge despite being directly opposite the WTC. (on our first nitght we watched the movie WTC in our room and it was weird to be looking down on the site at the same time - God bless America!)Nonetheless the Millenium closed for two years following those disasterous events and required substantial superficial rennovations which contribute to its pritine appearance today. The public areas are excellent, the rooms/bathrooms superb. The leisure cetnre is small but adequate with a nice pool which is a rarity in Manhattan but sadly there was no jacuzzi!The view from the upper floors are stunnning! On our final morning we awoke with a start to find a guy cleaning the windows which momentarily scared the cr*p out of us as it is the last thing you'd expect to see at that height! Check out was completely hassle free, the bill had been settled automaticaly and a reciept posted under our door on the moring of departure and the hotel stored our bags untill we left for the airport at 4pm. We had to nip into Century 21 to buy an extra suitcase to transport our purchases!All in all, this is an absolutley superb hotel at the price!Cant wait to go back!MP1

<Content>A great choice if the price is right! We stayed at the Millenium over the long Thanksgiving weekend (arriving after the parade!) while visiting our daughter who lives in Brooklyn. Having previously stayed at hotels in Times Square, we opted for something different this time around. I saw a really good nightly rate online and called the hotel directly and got the same rate. I asked for a City View King room and was thrilled when I walked in to a very large room, extremely clean, the bed was so comfortable with lavish linens (lots of pillows!). We were on the 51st floor, looking directly west (over the WTC site) and out over New Jersey. We could see south to the Statue of Liberty and north up Broadway. The window in the 51st floor elevator lobby afforded a terrific view of the Brooklyn Bridge (and Brooklyn) and the river. The plasma TV on the wall was terrific, very modern desk and dresser. Comfortable chair, large closet - lots of well-placed lamps and reading lights. The bathroom was very clean with lots of counter space (hair dryer, really really nice towels and lots of them, the usual shampoo, etc.). A nice touch was that an umbrella was in the closet for our use (didn't need it) and a safe was provided as well. The lobby was nice (a bit noisy with all the comings and goings) with a lobby bar but when the bar was full, there were no other places to hang out. The concierge was great, very good recommendations. Bellmen were johnny on the spot and apologized for the delay as we were leaving that there were no cabs to be had (we were leaving during Monday rush hour) but did call one specifically for us to get us to the airport on time. We really enjoyed our stay at the Millenium and will again (if the price is right). We were slightly amused that for the price we paid we didn't get free internet (neither in the room or in the business center) while the Burger King down the street (as well as other businesses) did! Even our cheap hotel room in Eau Claire, Wisconsin offers free WiFi!! Also, while the plasma screen TV was really nice and big, the restricted number of cable channels was a disappointment. Couldn't they offer a few more movie channels (only had HBO) or the more popular cable channels? Not that we watched too much TV, but after walking all day it was nice to unwind in the lovely room. Don't hesitate to stay at the Millenium if the price is right for your budget (we paid about $300 inc. taxes per night which we thought was a bargain in NYC).

<Content>very good choice I and my partner stayed at the Hilton for four nights for a long weekend in New York. The hotel is in the downtown area but easily accessible with public transport and a taxi ride to midtown is about $ 17. We arrived after a transatlantic flight in the evening and were immediately whisked in with the luggage all taken care of. The receptionist (Angie I think her name was) was extremely helpful as our request were a smoking room and a high floor. She excelled at this and we were given a fantastic room on the 54th floor overlooking ground zero and the Brooklyn Bridge. The room was exceptionally large by New York standards and had all the amnesties you could wish for: good internet connection (for a very reasonable $12/day), LCD TV, mini bar, large bathroom and excellent bed. The service overall was very efficient and friendly. The concierge helped us making restaurant reservations and taxis were flagged down very quickly.The only downside of the stay was the varying service in the bar next to the lobby. The prices for the very same drink orders seem to vary between staff and at one point the bar tender refused to allow us to take the drinks upstairs (his explanation was that they were short of that particular style of glasses, well then order some more).There are limited choices in the area for good food, but we tried Les Halles on 15 John St which was a good basic choice, 2 minutes from the hotel. Other than that you may have to travel a bit to get high quality restaurants. We loved Lever House Restaurant on 390Park Avenue.I can highly recommend the Millenium Hilton (even if the spelling annoys me) and considering the normally ridiculous room rates in New York the Hilton is definitely a bargain.

<Content>not great, not bad I booked a room here for just our first night arriving into NY because of mix ups on our dates and my first choice of hotel wasn鈥檛 available for that night. I wanted to leave a straightforward review of my experience of this hotel. I have to say that I was not overwhelmed in any sense 鈥?not great, not bad, nothing to write home about. When we arrived, the staff was professional but curt. I booked a high room with a city view. The only rooms they had available when we got there were rooms facing Ground Zero. The view looks straight down at Ground Zero. As other reviewers have said, there is heavy equipment operating and loud noise literally 24 hours a day so don鈥檛 expect a quiet night. We were exhausted when we got in so we ordered room service and I felt ill after the meal. In the morning, we ate a very expensive breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant. As far as the room, it was just a room, though tidy and clean. For the price and overall 鈥榚xperience鈥? I was completely underwhelmed.All in all, just a very so-so experience combined with disappointment relative to the price (very expensive during marathon time!)

<Content>Met my expectations Wife and I were at the Millenium for three nights on a Diamond award stay right before Thanksgiving 2007. Location of this hotel was perfect, as we eschewed the car and took Amtrak up from Washinigton, DC. We came up out of the PATH station at the World Trade Center station, and the hotel was staring us right in the face!Upon checking in, the front desk clerk told us our room was not ready. I asked for an upgrade and we were promptly assigned a corner junior executive suite on floor 38. That room was fantastic, with an impressive vista of the WTC site. We knew it was going to be noisy thanks to previous postings here but as with many others, it didn't overly bother us.Subway stations are within two blocks of the hotel, taking you just about anywhere you want to go in the city. At the end of our stay we saved probably $30 by taking the subway up to Penn Station to catch our train to Pennsylvania, instead of hailing a cab.During this trip, I fulfilled a lifelong dream of visiting Ellis Island. Battery Park, where you catch the ferry, is a 15-minute walk. We had dinner at the South Street Seaport one evening, another pleasant 15-minute walk.Only possible down side of the entire visit is that things pretty much fold up in the evening, but there are ways to compensate for that. Overall we had a fantastic time and I would stay here again. I want to thank all the previous posters for their insightful reviews and helpful suggestions.

<Content>Great hotel This is a really nice hotel. It provides everything you would expect from a hotel in this class, and it is a great deal at the weekend when the financial district is quiet. Excellent beds, helpful staff - no problems at all. Century 21, a truly wonderful department store - discount but not tacky - is right next door. However - it is not in Midtown or anywhere near it if you like to walk. We did not find the subway as convenient as it might have been: some stations are closed because of Ground Zero rebuilding and on the long weekend we were there, ticket machines wouldn't take any notes, only coins. Having just arrived, we didn't have many coins - so take some! Buses don't take notes either. You could buy a pass with a credit card, but obviously you need to be travelling a fair bit to make it worth it. None of this is the Millenium's fault - but be aware and come prepared. One other problem with the location is that there are very few restaurants within walking distance. It's a very nice hotel, but be prepared to use public transport a lot. Previously we had stayed in Midtown and were certainly spoilt for choice with restaurants close by, but of course, you pay more. For the money - we paid about $400 Australian per night - it's great.

<Content>amazing, great views an all round amazing trip, made even more special by this hotel. the millenium hilton was just amazing, ok it was a little bit noisy that is because they are working on the trade centre site. which is a stones through away, id recommend to every1 who wants to see new york to use the subway, a little daunting 1st time but the only way to see new york city, for example we caught a cab to mid town which cost $12 and 35 mins a subway tokk 7 mins and $2. my trip, hotel, experiance was amazing the only let down was the manners of people in new york, might just be me but manners do not cost anything.

<Content>Good value, good location NYC is getting more expensive by the month and it's really difficult to find a decently priced business-type hotel in Manhattan these days.....so I was pleased when I found the Millennium Hilton. I booked directly via hilton.com and paid 200 US dollars, a great price for this location.The rooms are spacious, modern, with fast internet service and are exactly what you would expect from a Hilton hotel. The hotel is definitely designed for business travellers....there is very little lobby space, few extra amenities and not much of a concierge service. Wall St is just a short walk away, and the hotel is on top of a subway station so it's easy to get around. Bargain hunters will be pleased to know that Century 21 is right next door too.Yes people may moan about the view, but what do they expect?! Look beyond the ground zero construction site and there is a perfectly nice view of the river, all the way across to the statue of liberty....

<Content>Millenium Hilton Very Nice...... We recently stayed at the Millenium Hilton and liked it very much.We went to NY to see Grease which we did not end up seeing because of the strike. They upgraded us to a suite because weare Hilton Gold Card members. The suite was very nice, the people who worked in the hotel were always very nice and attentive. We ate lunch and breakfast in the restuarant on the 3rd floor and that was also very good, but very expensive. It is located a bit far from Times Square - we took a cab which was about $16 each way. It is a nice walk to the Seaport/Waterfront area and Century 21 is right around the corner. We would stay at this property again as it was very nice all around.Linguica

<Content>Scary view Nothing wrong with this hotel. Location isn't for everyone, being very far downtown with few proper shopping/eating options. Room itself was pretty nice - standard modern Hilton. Staff were a bit snooty. I was woken up every 15 minutes as my room was next to the elevator, so the ding was annoying, and there was a housekeeping phone right outside the room that kept ringing. Staff comment was Oh, would you like us to shut down the elevator then?However - one thing to bear in mind that the hotel overlooks Ground Zero. Directly. In fact, you probably won't get a better view of the site of the fallen twin towers from anywhere. Maybe it's just me, but I found it a rather disturbing sight. Of course some people will find this interesting. I just found it was chilling.

<Content>Great hotel! I got a free night certificate as a result of a bad experience at the Hilton Toronto Airport, and decided to use it here.Requested a dry room because of my age (20) and got it.I had a room on the 46th floor with a great view of ground zero. Room was very clean, although just as I had expected, it was small. The elevators were VERY fast; it took about 20 seconds to go up to the 46th floor.The only one thing I didn't like was the way they did towels; they were like sandpaper. I'd definitely stay here again if I were given the opportunity!

<Content>Great Downtown Hotel We stayed from the 1st to 5th November and in total had 3 rooms. We needed to make a change to one of the rooms, which was completed with complete assistance by the staff. The room decor and layout was excellent with spacious bathroom, extremely comfortable beds and of course the large plasma TV. The location is very much downtown and for this reason you have to depend on Taxi's or subway. The E line is located pretty much outside the front door and will have you at the Port Authority or 5th Avenue in minutes. We didn't have an opportunity to eat in the hotel, prices where quiet high and with the availability of food on your doorstep you will never be stuck. We found staff to be very helpful with great recommendations from the concierge. Overall our stay was extremely relaxing and we would use this hotel again.

<Content>Great hotel We truly enjoyed staying in this hotel. When we arrived we asked for a different type of room and hotel staff made the change with a very positive attitude. All members of the hotel staff were polite and friendly. The room was wonderful, tastefully decorated with very comfortable beds, and a great view of Ground Zero. One day I was not feeling well and decided to stay in my room with the no disturb sign outside my door. Later that day I got a polite call from housekeeping services asking if everything was ok and offering to bring to the room anything I might need. We travel to New York at least once a year and this has been the best hotel experience we have ever had.

<Content>All round winner We stayed here for 5 nights - 10th through 14th October. The hotel is in a great location for exploring the downtown area, and a very short walk to subways on a number of different lines. We walked along to the South Street Seaport on two mornings for a relaxing coffee on the deck as the boats passed along the East River.The rooms were a mixed bag. We had a double for the first night which turned out to be two queen beds 鈥?certainly not enough room for three to sleep comfortably. The beds themselves were incredibly comfortable 鈥?just not big enough. Luckily we had booked a Junior Suite for the next four. What a difference. On the 29th floor, it was very spacious, and had three huge plate windows looking down towards the Battery, and out to the construction site that is Ground Zero, with the bustling traffic on the Hudson a lovely way to greet each morning. I didn't find it off-putting at all 鈥?it's just a hive of activity and a symbol of a people determined to recover. The iconic 'cross' section of the original building stands in front of the church just a little way up Church Street, and that is still moving.We loved our big 42鈥?plasma screen, but it didn't improve the quality of the programmes! That's not what we went for of course. The rooms had internet access for $12.95 per 24 hours. Yes it is noisy 鈥?they work from early morning to late (and I mean late) at night, except for Saturday night. So I bought earplugs, which worked a treat. $4.99 and you have hundreds of Duane Reades to choose from!We ate in a few places nearby. Go to the Stage Door Deli across the way for great breakfasts and real theatre courtesy of the staff. Have you ever seen a bagel fly? Well, you can here. We also ate in the Woolworth Building Kitchen which was excellent value. The hotel's restaurant serves up similar fare but is more expensive and less atmospheric than either of these.Being right next door to Century 21 is another plus 鈥?even if only for getting in early morning or late evening before it gets far too busy.Staff were courteous and helpful, and ensured that our pick-up to the airport was on time.I'd go back tomorrow. In fact I wish I could...

<Content>Met expectations The Millenium Hilton met our expectations. Fab price for the location and amenities- walking distance to Battery Park/ Statue of Liberty departures, multiple subway stops nearby. Most of the areas around the hotel have walkways for pedestrians now, so we didn't have any trouble getting around. Be aware of construction noise, but it didn't keep me from having a good night's sleep in the super-comfy bed. We had a view from the 27th floor overlooking the WTC site, but we found it more interesting than sad- good to see progress. Refrigerator and snack drawer are on the weighted system, so don't plan on storing food or beverages of your own. This hotel IS in New York City- parking is limited and expensive if you have to use it, and there are only two single bathrooms off the lobby. (A woman behind me in line was very rude with complaints about this fact.)

<Content>Thank Goodness for the Hilton !! When I was planning the trip to NYC as my daughter's 18th birthday present, I asked her if we should get a good hotel, or not bother, as we wouldn't be doing anything other than sleep in it. Well, thank goodness as any precocious 17 year old would, she wanted to spend the extra for a good hotel. So I chose the Millenium Hilton from the City  Show website, and actually got a pretty good deal.As it turned out, my daughter was EXTREMELY ill for the trip, for all of the 5 days we spent there. It started when she fainted on the plane out there (a BIG BIG thank you to the wonderful guys on Continental Airlines who helped her out with oxygen). So we got to Newark, got our taxi to the hotel, and my daughter didn't leave after that (except for an hour in Bloomingdales and a pre-booked helicopter trip). She couldn't walk one block so didn't even see Ground Zero.So we were stuck in our fantastic hotel room on the 44th floor, with our excellent view up towards the Empire State. As a busy working mum, I actually found the enforced stay very relaxing - we caught up on all of our movies on the big flat screen! The staff was very helpful, and the beds extremely comfortable. This hotel made what could have been an utterly miserable trip, bearable.I had a meal in the restaurant one evening which was very pleasant. Also, the hotel is right next to Century 21, which is ideal for cut-price shopping. And the World Financial Centre is also worth a look, as well as the church across the road which at that time still held the memorabilia for the lost loved ones of the 9/11 tragedy.The only problem (and why I'm not giving it a 5 rating) is that there were no instructions by the phone on how to ring an international call back home to Ireland, and I inadvertently dialled various numbers (including to Africa apparently!) and I had to work hard with the reception staff not to be charged an exorbitant amount.I think I'd like somewhere more central next time, but if you want to be downtown, this is the place. My daughter recovered when we got back home of course, and we know someday we'll be able to laugh about it (just not yet!).

<Content>Hilton Millenium is good, but not great The Hilton Millenium is located across the street from the WTC complex and most of the rooms overlook the area, which can be a bit depressing. If you can handle that, the hotel is located in a great location. Several subway stops are within a couple of blocks and the area is a little less hectic than mid-town.The room itself is pretty nice, with a very nice plasma TV (but what are you doing watching TV in NYC?). The service is so-so. The construction around the hotel can be pretty aggrevating. The construction noise isn't that bad, but all the sidewalks have been narrowed and with all the street vendors around it can be very slow to get back to the hotel from the subway.

<Content>Will go back... My husband and I have just returned from a 5 day trip to NY and we had a fantastic time. Hotel room was 4111 junior suite which had three huge windows all with fantastic views. Looking down over the WTC site and across to the Statue of Liberty, looking up Broadway towards the Empire State Bldg and across towards the Brooklyn Bridge. Found hotel staff very helpful and friendly, no complaints there. We did find the room a little noisy from work going on below at the WTC , sometimes work would start very early in the morning (even Sunday) and end quite late. That said the views from the room made up for it.We ate in the hotel and found the food to be ok although the dining room has no character. Good deli across the road, The Stage Door. Had carry outs and breakfast there, hightly recommended.Great location though and would stay here again. Worth taking the helicopter trip.

<Content>Great stay at the Millennium Hilton My mom and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The room was clean and very comfortable. We didn't hear any street/construction noise from our room on the 12th floor. The hotel was very accommodating, and gave us a room with 2 double beds even though we had booked a king through priceline. The room was quite large by NYC standards. It's very accessible by public transportation, and very easy to get to via train from Newark Airport. Also, you are able to print your boarding pass from the lobby, which is a big plus.

<Content>Worst Service in NY!!! I have stayed at and held meetings at over 25 hotels in NYC and I have to say that this hotel was by FAR the worst experience I ever had. I can't understand how this hotel was given 4 stars. With Ground Zero right below, even getting to the hotel is a nightmare, nevermind the $90 parking, rude hotel staff from the front desk all the way up to the FB Manager and less than sparkling rooms! Everyone seems to have a chip on their shoulder and act as if I should be LUCKY to be staying here. I am very understanding of slight issues at a hotel and would never give a terrible rating unless it was very well deserved. The prices are cheap for a reason people- Look elsewhere!!!

<Content>Overrated Stayed here between 14 - 17 September 2007. The hotel's has a new modern feel to it but lacks character. The 42 plasma is a nice touch but they are cheap 42 plasmas and therefore the quality of the picture is not great, however, that's really not that important unless you are considering spending the whole time wathcing TV in your bedroom. The hotel staff were average/above average i.e. some good, some crap! The Church  Dey restaurant is like a morgue, basically nobody seems to go in there for some reason, maybe it was the bread (like chewing a brick). The waiters/esses were looking for something to do (have never seen to waiters fight over who to take the empty plates to the kitchen before!). Small, crowded reception area, extremely noisy outside with the WTC construction. +'s were next to Century 21 and opposite train station. If you are looking for a suite stay in Embassy Suites down in Battery Park, similar price + free buffet breakfast

<Content>Great stay Great hotel and wonderful location. We booked online through Expedia and got a fantastic deal for a Jr. Suite. The room was large and very clean. The staff in general were very nice, giving the bar staff the biggest kudoos. Our only complaint is that when my husband miss placed his key, the front desk would not give him another one, because the room was not booked in his name. However, at check in they asked for the name of anyone else staying in the room. If I hadn't been there (in the shower at the time) he would hvae been loked out until I returned. When I went downstairs to ask why his name hadn't been added to the guest list, I recieved a blank stare and asked if I wanted to get another key. Other than that we had a great stay and since Centry 21 is right next door we will be returning sooner than my husband thinks! LOL

<Content>The Tops! I have just returned from a five day break at the Millenium Hilton NYC and can't wait to return. If you are looking for a fantastic hotel with breathtaking views and great comfort look no further.We had a junior suite on the fifteenth floor which was ample space for a family of four. It consisted of two rooms connected by a small hallway and a bathroom. I have read some negative comments about the staff so I was prepared for some attitude, but I would like to say that every staff member we came into contact with was polite, friendly and couldn't do enough for us. If you like to shop Century 21 is next door with a Starbucks in between. I can highly recommend breakfast at the Stage Door Deli in the next block. Room service was fabulous with huge portions and a very quick service.I really didn't want to leave.

<Content>Loved It We stayed at the Millenium Hilton Sept 14 to Sept 17. We got an excellent price of $249.00 per night on the Hotel website. We arrived at 8:00 am on the 14th and were given a room despite the fact that check in is at 3:00 pm. The hotel lobby although not impressive was clean and functional. The hallways were well lit and clean. The room was excellent. I generally do not feel comfortable in hotel rooms however this was not the case here. I did not notice any dirt or spots on the carpet. The bed was great. The room was well appointed and had a flat secreen television. All of the staff we dealt with were friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again. As for the negatives, there is loud construction at the WTC site and this hotel is right across the street from Ground Zero. The only issue we had was being awoken at 6:30 am on Saturday morning by the noise. It is also located in the financial district and not conveiniently located to Times Square. We did not really have a problem with these things though. We did not try the restaurant or bar at this hotel. This hotel is definity worthy of a four star rating unlike many four star hotels is NYC. The best Hotel I have stayed at in NYC in my opinion.

<Content>you have to stay here!!!! As you can tell by the title we very much enjoyed our stay at this hotel...everything went amazingly smooth while we were there...the room was fantastic...a view you couldnt believe...overlooking the WTC site...and so clean with lots of room to spread out and relax...the staff was excellent with any questions we had...the concierge was a great resource and we asked them so many questions and they had an answer for everyone of them...from where to eat to what to do...the only thing that I wasnt too crazy about was the distance from Times Square and all the main attractions...taxi cab ride was about 15-20 dollars but if you dont mind manning the subway than that would be a cheaper way of going around the city...we really cant say enough good things about the hotel...it was everything we were hoping for and more and will be staying there again when we visit NYC!!!!

<Content>A room with a (superb) view I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of a USA holiday. Have visited NYC many times and recognised that the area was not the best location for Manhattan, but knew it was convenient for public transport .The weekend rate was fantastic and I booked a corner suite for arouhnd 拢160 per night. The room was on the 51st floor and looked down onto Ground Zero, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island from one aspect and from the other, Brooklyn Bridge. The views are fabulous and made the stay very special; you could not foregt what city you were in!The room was also a very good size, nicely appointed, flat screen TV and a conmfortable and very big bed. Decent bathroom. Would highly recommend.

<Content>Romantic New Year City Break My now-husband but then-boyfriend and I visited New York for the first time at New Year and chose this hotel due to it's down-town Manhattan location and star rating.Upon arrival, reception was very busy, and we were a little dissapointed by the staff, who were perfectly professional and efficient, but as a result - not overly friendly. That aside, the service was excellent, if not with a smile.The room was a comfortable size, with full length ceiling to floor windows on one side, a wide screen tv with cable and plenty of storage as well as a lovely bathroom.We had a room on the 29th floor (I think) which had spectacular views overlooking the ground zero site. One of the first things we did was go and visit the site, an emotional experience, having wached those awful events live on the news all day when they unfolded.We were only in the city for a few days, over the New Year period, and found the hotel an excellent home from home after travelling around the city seeing the sights. Century 21 is right next door and full of great bargains, and as soon as you get used to the subway system, the city is very easy to navigate from here. We walked to Wall Street, and over to the Statton Island ferry port (were you get the ferry to go to the Statue of Liberty) as well. This was not a 5 minute walk, more like 20 - 30, but enjoyable, even in December.New Year's eve was a greatly anticipated event for us, and we chose to do it the traditional NY way and go to Time Sq. We had received advice to get there very early, and we thought 6pm would be early enough. Boy we were wrong. We finally made it into a pen about 10 blocks back from Time Sq, where we were unable to get out for food, drink or toilet breaks. We stood for 6 hours with little idea of what was happening in the centre, and by the time the ball dropped, we were ready to drop ourselves!The party atmosphere was a little jaded by this point, but we still cheered, hugged the poeple we'd met in the crowd, and then my husband proposed. This made it all a lot more bearable, of course! If I was to recommend a NY New Year to anyone, I would say they should book into a hotel off Time Sq, or book at a restaurant nearby, as this will make for a much more pleasant experience! If not, you probably need to arrive at about mid day to get a spot in the centre, which I'm sure would be worthwhile.All was made more wonderful when we returned to the hotel, hungry and cold to find that NY truly is the city that never sleeps. Through room service we were able to order a pizza from the parlour down the road. It was delivered to our room at about 1 am and must have been the best pizza I have ever eaten!All other meals we bought outside of the hotel, so I'm afraid this was our only experience of room service, which I must say was excellent.

<Content>Good, but not quite up to the price We stayed here one night after a cross country flight, before sailing from NY the following day. The staff were all very competent and friendly and the property was nice looking and clean. The restaurant was fine, but not stellar. Our room was very small, much more like a London hotel room than a high priced NY property. Overall, perfectly fine, but for the cost we were expecting more.

<Content>Excelllent Downtown Hotel Staying directly across the street from the World Trade Center site can be a bit sobering (and noisy certain times of the day since the Site is now an active construction zone) but the hotel's services and amenities make it a very pleasurable stay. You can get anywhere in NYC via the subway from this location with mid-town being only a 10 minute subway ride away. Taxi's are plentifull given it's downtown location. Good dining in Tribeca, Soho, and the Village is a 15 - 30 minute walk away or 5 minutes by taxi or subway. Battery Park and the Ferries to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are just a 10 minute walk.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in excellent location When: Thurs Aug 9 鈥?Mon Aug 13Price: Priceline $150/nt ($178/nt after taxes). Rack rate $202+taxThe Hotel:Fully renovated after 2001. The hotel was very new looking, very clean and the staff were excellent. Bed and pillows were the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Each room has a 42鈥?plasma TV but I did not see any HD tv channels so you can鈥檛 really take advantage of it. There is a small bar fridge but you can鈥檛 use it because it is full of their items and if you move anything the electronic sensors will bill you. There was a ice container we would fill up to keep our leftover cheesecake good until the next day.Elevators were crazy fast, we were on the 50th floor and never had to wait longer than 20 seconds for an elevator and the full trip was under 30 seconds. Pool and fitness room were quite reasonable. Check in time is 3pm but we there is quite a rush at that time. We arrived at 11am and simply dropped off our luggage and pre-reserved a room (ask for one on the side away from Church St. for lovely views on the Brooklyn st bridge and to avoid the near 24 hr construction at the WTC site. Parking is super expensive at the hotel so we just dropped off our luggage and parked at a parking lot under the FDR drive by the Brooklyn Bridge (take Frankfort St toward South St) and you can鈥檛 miss it. $21/day taxes included for parking in a fully insured and monitored car lot.Location/Activities:The hotel is on Church street in SOHO Financial district right across from the big hole in the ground that was the world trade center. Metro entrances 2 min walk from the hotel but another 5-6 min underground to get to the line. ~15-20 min by metro to Times Square and other great areas. 10 min walk to the Staten Island ferry which is a faster and cheaper (free) to take a boat past the statue of Liberty. The financial district is much quieter at night than midtown but my wife and I never felt unsafe walking the streets to the hotel at midnight after a broadway show. There are cheap ways to eat in the area. Our favorite nearby was a 24hr buffet ($5.74/lb of food) at about Fulton St and William St. Also a nice bistro and grocery store at about Liberty St and William St. We brought our own cereal and bowls and simply bought a liter of milk from the pharmacy on Fulton just east of Broadway each morning on our way to the TKTS booth for a super cheap breakfast. The TKTS booth is at the corner of John St and Front St about 10 min walk from the hotel. This TKTS booth opens at 11am for that evenings and the next days matinees shows. Be aware that the tickets are pretty much all $60 for Broadway shows (they only really discount the most expensive seats) and they tend not to have the most popular shows (Hairspray, Rent, Legally Blond, Mary Poppins, ect.). Also note there are really no Broadway shows on Sunday nights. We did however see Chorus line, Curtains, Phantom of the Opera and The Drowsy Chaperone. The TKTS booth in Times square sells that days matinees and evening shows and tends to have a better selection but longer lines. It also opens later (2pm) so it wrecks your day more. Food before broadway shows can be had cheaply on Eighth ave between 44th 鈥?45 th st (Subway, burger and pizza joints, ect) but I highly recommend 鈥淛uniors鈥?on 45th St just west of Broadway. $10 sandwiches and burgers and the best cheesecake in the world ($6.50) 鈥?I recommend the devils foodcake or the chocolate mousse cheesecake. They have a takeout counter but if you want to sit down show up early.Over all:Excellent hotel. Worth the 4 stars and in a great location for those who don鈥檛 mind being a little further from the hustle and bustle of Midtown.

<Content>Nice Hotel Overall it was a nice stay. I really only have one small complaint. I got a great deal on Priceline and would definitely stay again if I could get a good deal.Pros: Room was plenty big enough, air conditioner worked fine and offered range of temps, bed was comfortable and the curtains let the room get pretty dark. We had a high floor so noise wasn't really an issue. Elevators were fast and you never had to wait for more than a couple seconds for one to come. Plenty of cabs outside and subway right across the street. Bathroom was very big and roomy. Nice soft towels and lots of counter space. I didn't need internet access while I was there so I don't know how that service was but my cell phone reception was great throughout the hotel. I didn't use the fitness center - I ran on the streets while I was there and I ran alone and felt completely safe. I also didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the food.Cons: Checkin was a little slow - they only had 2 people behind the desk and I'll never understand why hotels don't put up a queue line. Although there was an informal line of people waiting to check in, some rude guests were just walkin in and going right up to the counter in front of everyone who was waiting. THey really need to get their check in process straightened out! Other than this one little complaint, I would recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Exemplary Service at the Millenium Hilton! My husband and I celebrated an anniversary in Manhattan and stayed for one night at the Millenium Hilton. We were delighted with our elegant, comfortable room on the 16th floor and the prompt, friendly service we received at the front desk. But the great quality of service at the hotel did not become fully apparent until after I returned home, only to realize that I had left my much-loved robe on the hook mounted on the backside of the bathroom door. I called the hotel security department the next morning and spoke with two courteous, efficient staff members--Manny and T-- who quickly located my robe and mailed it to my home. We definitely would stay again at the Millenium on our next trip to Manhattan.

<Content>What a horrible place - matches the Hilton chain This hotel has been by far one of my worst hotel experiences ever - rude staff, lazy staff, dirty room, etc. The list goes on and on.Hmmm... I had several billing issues with the front desk over charging me for items that I had not purchased and had nothing to do with. I was basically told that if I did not want to experience these problems then I should not have stayed at their property --- and this was by the front desk manager. How horrible!Be very careful with this property....

<Content>Good stay at Millenium Hilton I stayed at this hotel with my wife and 17 month old daughter from July 20-22. The hotel rooms have clearly been renovated recently and they've added some nice touches. The bed was very comfortable and the large flat screen t.v is built into the wall. The bathroom was nicely renovated and decorated as well. We had a room on the 20th floor over looking the World Trade Center site. Although, it is not the most pleasant of memories, I the view was a good reminder of all that happened that day. I booked the hotel through priceline and got a great rate and a great room. I even requested to be moved initially because the original room they gave me was too close to the elevators. I was moved without a problem. The front desk staff were courteous and helpful. The location of the hotel is perfect is you're looking to be in the SOHO/Financial district and close to the Hudson River. It's only about a 10 minute walk to the river. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved it We used priceline and were a little worried about getting stuck with a bad room, but they gave us a great room on a high floor. The front desk staff was very friendly (from my experience, this is usually not the case at hotels in new york city). If you are lucky Oscar will help, he was especially nice and left a great impression of both the hotel and the city on me and my new wife.

<Content>Nice hotel if you can take the view Very nice hotel, clean, large rooms for New York, great beds, if you can stand the depressing view of the World Trade Center site. Mysterious construction goes on at all times making for some noise, but really not too bad. Good location for financial district or Tribeca, would stay in again if I needed to (just wouldn't look out the window!).

<Content>Sleek Rooms, Clean and Comfortable Really enjoyed our stay. We had a corner room with an absolutely magnificent view. The room was completely new with a large flat screen TV that the children loved. Everything was clean. The service at the front desk was great.This hotel overlooks the new construction site where the twin towers once stood. We were glad to have a room facing away from the site and our view of the NY skyline was superb. Enjoy.

<Content>Excellent But Be Cautious! I have stayed here a number of time, only because Priceline.comhas given me the opportunity at a low rate.The hotel is sleek, modern, and high rise; as a result of beingrebuilt after 9/11. It is directly across the street from the construction site for the rebuilding of the 9/11 complex.Thus, it can be noisy and the main entrance, Church Street, isoften closed.Consequently, the price is low because of these inconveniences,but you can reap the benefits of a beautiful hotel by requestinga high floor facing the Brooklyn Bridge and the east side oflower Manhattan. I have stayed in many hotels in NYC and thiswould be my first choice if view is important.I have stayed on the 9/11 side of the hotel at a high floor andgenerally you can avoid the noise while enjoying a truly marvelous view of the Hudson River, New Jersey, 9/11 site, and the Statue of Liberty.If you want to stay in lower Manhattan, stay here. You can walk toSouth Street seaport, Wall Street, Battery Park, City Hall, theBrooklyn Bridge, etc.Just remember to be smart and request a room on a high floor.Staff are accommodating and the amenities are first class.Once the new World Trade Center site has been completed, the prices at this hotel will skyrocket !

<Content>Lovely Hotel! Although I am late in writing this review, I thought I had to get something on here as I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel.. The location for my partner and myself was great, we were not in hustle a bustle with all the noise that comes with it, but only a stones throw from the subway so we could be there within minutes if we wanted to. Tribeca has some nice places to eat particularly the Tribeca bar and grill, which I would recommend although we were very jetlagged, so did not enjoy the food as much as we could have done, as we were so tired. The stage door over the road is a great place for a cheap breakfast. We did not eat in the hotel, as we were always out and about. Whilst in New York my partner proposed to me so as a celebration we managed to get a table at the nearby restaurant Nobu which was my most favourite place to eat whilst in New York鈥?if you can get a table do go although more pricey than other restaurants it was delicious! We managed to squeeze in all of the usual touristy things to do whilst stopping five nights in New York my favourite things being the Sex and the City tour鈥 must if you are a fan we also loved wandering round Greenwich village, it was such a lovely place to visit with great shops and the views from the TOTR were brilliant. Our one disappointment was the Helicopter ride as this was bought at a Christmas present off my mam鈥t was a complete rip off we were not even in the sky anymore than five mins and we had paid for the 9 minute ride, there was also no commentary. The rooms at the hotel were well presented and cleaned daily with nice toiletries in the bathroom and an excellent power shower. The beds were so comfortable, which is just what you need after a long day walking round the city. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful particularly when asking for advice and directions and were not always hanging around for tips.Overall a great hotel that I would recommend!

<Content>A pretty nice hotel Generally when visiting NYC we use points to stay at the Waldorf-Astria, but since they've changed to seasonal rewards and the Millenium Hilton had really reasonable weekend rates we thought we'd give it a whirl. We were upgraded to a corner suite (Diamond status), were issued breakfast coupons on checkin (the breakfast here is 10x better than the Waldorf's) and there are several subway lines there that makes it very easy to go through the city - and oh yea, there aren't 101 tourist walking all around like times square (but the tourist aren't too bad by the Waldorf either). The hotel is much nicer than I thought and pretty up-to-date including large flat-panel TV's (but I hope you didn't come to NYC to watch the tele) - I think it was fully refurbished after Sept 11. The elevators to the high-floors are super-fast. This is a compounding effect. Because the elevators are so fast you get to your room quicker, which means it can make more runs therefore less people per elevator ride, which means less stops on your way to your room, which means you get to your room even quicker. We're independent travelers, so don't use services from the hotel staff much, but we experiences some wonderfully positive and knowledgeable people, and some staff that we're so keen either of those qualities. The only other would be that there is no free wireless in the lobby and no wireless (paid or otherwise) in the room - they do have a LAN line. ...next time we stay in NYC, we might just stay here again...

<Content>Nice, if you request the right rooms! Our room faced the old World Trade Center site, and boy, was it noisy from construction. Even with ear plugs, my husband and I had trouble sleeping. We learned that the noise bounces up, so it doesn't matter how high you are, you'll still hear it. After two nights, we requested a room facing the opposite direction, and what a difference that made! The new room was quiet and had a beautiful view. The staff aims to please, and the rooms are well appointed. Everything seems brand new and spotless. I would stay there again, but be sure to ask for a room facing away from the WTC.

<Content>Millenium Hotel After reading the other reviews of this hotel I was looking forward to staying there but I ended up being disappointed.On arrival at the hotel It took 3 bell hops to get our cases to our room 1 to get them out of the taxi, another to put them on a trolley and the third to get them up to the room. We really don't mind tipping but this we found that this was rather excessive even for New York standards. On arrival at reception the staff were more concerned about chatting to on another than checking us in. Throughout our stay not one of the reception staff greeted us with a smile and it really felt as if they had a could not care attitude .(Perhaps it was because we were english..)The room was clean and tidy and the bedlinens were rather lovely but some of the towels were stained so we were very particular over the ones which we used.On leaving .My husband had to ask them to take off a movie we had been charged for . We could barely get the Tv doofer to work ( batteries we thought) let alone manage to navigate the system for a pay as you go movie. Trying to get hold of a bell hop for help with the suitcases was a complete waste of time after calling both the bell hops and the concerge numbers alternatively for over 20 minutes I ended up struggling down in the lift with 3 suitcases and 2 bags by myself. I was told that I should have rung reception because they had changed their numbers...!!!! duh as if I would have known that one...!!!On the whole the hotel was ok but they need to sort out the staffing issues.One last thing, If you don't like having street vendors hanging around outside the hotel then this isn't the hotel for you.Each day at least 5 street vendors were pitched up outside the hotel on what appeared to be hotel frontage, selling immitation handbags, purses watches etc.The best thing about it was Kevin from room service who provided me with honey and lemon for a cold. and it's closeness to Century 21 , the seaport and the village.

<Content>Loved it!! We stayed here in May and absolutely loved it!! It's kinda crazy though because if the wind is blowing really hard the hotel sways a little because it is so thin!! People there were very nice except the concierge at one point because we asked about great shoe stores and we were led on a scary adventure!! Anyways I love the city and you can just hop on the subway right smack into Times Square! Can't beat it!

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Excellent Value for Money I booked this hotel becuase of the good reviews and as I am a virgin frequent flyer I was sent a Hilton Gold card free so we tried this hotel after our favourite hotel in New York closed (Swissotel - The Drake). The check in was superb and we were offered vouchers for a free breakfast every morning which saved us over 拢130 just for producing the card.We stayed in a very large, immaculately clean room on the 55th floor overlooking the World Trade Centre. I cannot think of anything which could have been improved upon during our stay!The only thing we did find is that the area around the hotel is very quiet at night, we missed the buzz of midtown when we went out at night.

<Author>SDWanderlust
<Content>Nice Hotel Location:Some of the previous comments mentioned that the location of this hotel is deserted at night. I had some hesitations when making the reservation. I searched and wanted to change to another hotel almost up to my arrival date due to those comments. Luckily, I didn鈥檛. I actually liked the location as many of the subway line end up at this location. I can see that some people might not like this part of town at night as it is not hopping as other places such as Times Square.Night time was indeed less crowded than during the day time. At night, I would still see people around. Furthermore, this place is not so far from China Town and Little Italy and at night, there are lots of people in the area to eat etc. I actually liked this location lots as I have an affinity for Asian food. In addition, Century 21, an outlet shop is right next door. Hotel:Initially, I requested room with a king sized bed. They honored my request. When I got up to the room, it was a bit small. I came down and asked for an upgrade. They told me that there was no upgrade available. They gave me a corner room with a queen sized bed instead, which was way more spacious. Ask for a corner room, if you can. I did not find too many negatives to write about. The one thing that sort of irked me a bit was the hot water; it took about a minute to have hot water in the shower. The bathroom amenities were what one would expect at a hotel of this category. Toiletries were of Crabtree and Evelyn. Plenty of towels in the bathroom. There were no slippers or bathrobes, something I never really use. The bed, pillows, and sheets were all good. More importantly, there were all white. No motel styled/ flower sheets. There was a nice and big flat screen with cable channels. There was no Wifi in the room. High speed internet can be had for $5.95 a day, which I think was not too bad. I have seen high speed internet rate at $ 15/day. However, there was free Wifi in the lobby. There were ice bucket and wine glasses in the room . There was also a mini bar, which I did not use. Everything was clean and worked well. The pool was really nice. I used it everyday during my stay. I (we) stayed there for 3 nights.Service:Checking in and checking out were a breeze. They were all very efficient and gracious. Housing keeping was efficient. There was downtown service as well. Recommendation: I definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. I would stay here again in the future. I find that for the price of $260/night (including tax) I paid for, it offered a really good value. The same hotel category in Midtown probably will cost twice as much, if not more. I booked my through Hilton website. I remember that some other previous post mentioned that it costs lots. I think I lucked out by booking early.

<Content>Great Hotel! This was my first visit to New York city to attend a wedding and I spent weeks researching online and agonizing where to stay as I read all sorts of horror stories about bad hotel experiences in NY City. Because I noted that the Millenium Hilton got consistently high ratings from most guests I decided to take the advice of the TripAdvisor Members and book my Memorial Weekend stay there even though it's location was quite far from where the rehearsal dinner and wedding were to take place. I am glad that I did!! The hotel and rooms are as gorgeous as the pictures in Trip Advisor and Travelocity! The location one of the quietest spots in NY. Hardly any traffic noise could be heard from my room. I don't know if it being Memorial Day weekend had anything to do with the low noise as there were workmen at the ground zero site and plenty of people in the streets but at any rate, the low noise level worked out fine for me.The hotel decor was modern and the entire facility looked very well kept. The carpeting was plush and all the brass and glass surfaces sparkled. The hotel also has its own garage for guest parking . My room was a little bit bigger in size than my home's master bedroom which I understand from some of the reviews I've read here is big by NY standards. It boasted a very large (Queen I think) and extremely comfortable bed with lots and lots of fluffy pillows and a long sausage pillow which is perfect for folks that like to wrap themselves around a pillow for support. The room and carpet were clean. There was also a large flat screenss stereo tv that was equipped with both a wireless keyboard (for internet surfing) and game controls for playing video games. The tv system would also allow the viewing and purchase of movies but I don't know the prices because I did not choose to use any of those features but I'm sure that you could run up quite a bill. There was a well stocked mini bar with beer, soda and snacks but because they're notoriously expensive I didn't dare consume any of them. There was also a dresser with two empty drawers for storing your stuff. There were two telephones. One in the bathroom and a cordless two line model next to the bed. There were two separate reading lamps on each side of the bed and a very simple to use alarm/clock radio with your choice of sounds to wake up to. There was also a writing desk that was equipped with two jacks for internet access for laptop computers. One jack was for a regular phone line modem and the second one was for DSL access. Next to the desk was a table that held an ice bucket, a wine bottle opener and glasses and an coffeemaker with cups and coffee supplies. There were also two comfy chairs, an ottoman a small table and new issues of two NY entertainment guide magazines. Next to the bed inside the night stand's drawer was a free paperback copy of Conrad HIlton's autobiography which I'm still reading. The room had it's own climate control for the a/c heat system and it worked flawlessly at keeping the room at the temperature that I set it to. There are no keys for the doors of the suites, instead you get a credit sized electronic key that unlocks the door for you. In my standard room there was also a full length mirror and plenty of lighting and seating. Two features of my room impressed me. The well appointed closet and bathroom.The well appointed closet held, a folding suitcase stand, a large umbrella with the Hilton logo and around 4 or 10 thick wooden hangers. A couple had clips for holding skirts, a couple had trouser bars and two were thickly padded ones of the type for holding evening dresses. There was also an iron and ironing board in the closet and on the top shelf your very own electronically controlled combination safe for your valuables. The bathroom was very well lit. It had a very large mirror and an illuminated magnifying makeup mirror that swiveled. There was also a hair dryer. The faux marble counter ran the entire length of the bathroom so you had lots of room for your toiletries. It also included a nicely appointed bathroom set which included facial tissue, drinking glasses and Crabtree  Evelyn toiletries (mouthwash, shampoo, hair conditioner, a shower cap, bubble bath and body lotion and bar soap) and lots and lots of fluffy towels. The shower/ tub had a swiveling shower head that you could adjust to deliver either a full stream of water or a pulsating shower massage. The water was plentiful as either ice cold or scalding hot and the water pressure was just fine. The toilet was one of the quietest flushing models I've ever heard and worked flawlessly. From my window I had a great view of ground zero and the window curtains could be adjusted to let in either a lot of light or shut it out completely. I was on the 17th floor and could hardly hear any of the traffic below. The downtown location is excellent. Hilton provided in each room a folded pocket sized map of NY city with indicators for different businesses in the immediate area as well as the locations and routes of the subway system. This little jewel of a map was my lifeline and guide during my entire stay in NYC. Meals in the hotel (like in any hotel) are expensive ($22.00 for breakfast) but there are lots of inexpensive diners in the area. Right in the next block was the Stage Door Deli (open 7 days) where I got one of the biggest and best breakfasts I've ever had (2 scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast and coffee) for only $7.00 and their sandwiches are excellent! There are also the ever present hot dog carts on almost every corner where you can get really delicious hot dogs, shishkebabs or pretzels for a very reasonable price.Next to the hotel is a large discount dept store (21st Century) so if you forgot to pack something like a shirt or tie or socks or shoes you could shop there for designer brands at discount prices. The subway was less than a 1/2 block away and easy to navigate. A one way fare is only $2.00 but you can buy a fun pass for $7.00 which gives you unlimited rides all day.However, if you choose to take a taxi to where the action is (Central Park area) I found that it will set you back around $22.00 plus tip because remember, the Millenium is waaaayyyyy downtown in the financial district. A taxi ride to the airports - I was told- can cost you as much as $55.00 plus tolls, plus tax plus tip so I chose to ride in and out of Newark Airport on the super shuttle van service which costs only $17.00 plus tax and tip. BTW you can make reservations with Super Shuttle airport van service by toll free phone or online. Their only drawback is that because the shuttle goes around picking up passengers in other hotels besides you they will require that you be ready to check out quite a few hours before your flight. For example, my flight departed at 11:00 am but their pickup time for me by the shuttle was 7:30 But, it was a reasonable trade off for the savings. And their service was really, really good. They even telephoned a reminder of my reservation to my cellphone and their cancellation policy is reasonable if your travel plans change.The Millenium Hilton hotel lobby is very nicely decorated in modern style and had a small but well appointed gift shop. They looked as good as in the pictures shown on line.The lobby also had a bar at the other end but I didn't patronize it so I can't critique it. The hotel also had a gym, a restaurant and I think that it also had a pool but I didn't check them out. Overnight shoe shine service was also available.One lobby feature that I liked was a touch screen kiosk where you could punch in your flight information and a printed boarding pass would pop out for your convenience. On the back end of the block from the hotel were a Dunkin Donuts, several small diners and a big CVS pharmacy. Around two blocks down from the hotel was a Barney's Men's clothing store (another NY institution). Chinatown and Little Italy neighborhoods were a brisk walking distance away and in those areas I encountered loud traffic and massive flocks of people spilling from the sidewalks walking cheek  jowl making me glad that I didn't pick a hotel in those areas! I wanted quiet and I got it at the Millenium.A short walk to the other side of ground zero across from the hotel and you were walking by the bay and I could see the statue of Liberty at a distance. Water taxi and sightseeing services are available in the area. I read a lot of horror stories about NY hotels trying to stick its guests with padded bills for minibar snacks that were not consumed or treating a customer poorly because they booked their room thru a discount service like travelocity but that didn't happen to me at the Millenium. When I telephoned ahead from my room to advise the front desk that I was checking out a very nice lady at the the other end told me that I had incurred no additional charges and that the prepaid travelocity bill had covered everything in my stay. All I had to do at checkout was to drop off my electronic room key at the front desk and just and walk out the door (didn't even had to sign anything) to my waiting ride never encountering any pushy doormen or bellboys. They were all very pleasant, courteous and helpful. The concierges Justin and Mark bent over backwards in giving me directions to my travel and shopping destinations and the bellhops and front desk personnel were just as attentive, pleasant and polite.There are other Hilton hotels in NY and I can't honestly say that all of them treat their guests the same way or have the same amenities but I did enjoy my stay in the big apple at the Millenium Hilton and I definitely recommend them and I would stay there again on my next visit to NYC. 5 stars!!!

<Content>Great hotel Stayed at this locale over Memorial Weekend. Very helpful staff. Was a litte concerned about the location, but found it to be ok. Right next to a subway stop, which is great. Room was 1 king bed w/ a 40+inch flat screen, which was a nice touch. Room was well decorated and decent size. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Faultless I had a fantastic short break in New York at stayed at the Millenium Hilton, while it was quite expensive, you definately get your money's worth. We had a junior suite which was immaculate, the maid service was excellent.I found the staff to be very helpful and polite and nothing appeared to be too much trouble for them. The pool and sauna were lovely, although the water was very cold! The restaurant was lovely, although I struggled to find something I wanted on the menu, ended up with a salad which was very nice.Location was excellent, the subway was right nearby and taxis from Times Square (for when we were feeling lazy in the evening) were reasonably cheap.It was a great base to explore New York from and I totally enjoyed my stay there. I'd definately recommend it.

<Content>Favorite NYC Hotel This is my favorite hotel in New York City. While it can be pricey, and it is out of the hustle and bustle of midtown Manhattan (it is on the southern tip of the island across from the WTC), if is one of the nicest properties in Manhattan. The staff is professional, and while they run the check in process like an assembly line, they get it right and get you moving quick. The rooms have always been clean when I have stayed here, the flat screen tvs are nice, but the hotel doesn't have hi def tv service so the picture isn't the best. The internet is 4.95 a night and wired only, and the room service is actually inexpensive for New York City. The pool area is clean, although the water is usually cold. There has always been plenty of hot water, and good water pressure. The Evelyn and Crabtree toiletries are nice, and there are always plenty of towels. The subway (E Train) is right across the street and two stops away from 42nd street. For someone like me its nice to go to this hotel after a day uptown with all the tourists as after 6:00 the financial district is basically deserted. I highly recommend this property.

<Content>Beautiful Room and View I tried Priceline for the first time as we were going to the city for my birthday and wanted to stay somewhere for one night. I won a room here (4 star downtown in Priceline terms) for 200.00 per night. I used to work 2 blocks away so never really thought of staying here for a night out since it wouldnt seem like a get away necessarily but we were pleasantly surprised by our experience. The front desk was very friendly and our check in and out experience couldnt have been faster. We had a room on the 35th floor that overlooked the WTC site and the Hudson. The beds was incredibly comfortable, the tv was large and new with a good selection of channels and the bathroom was large and very clean.I do have two small negatives that I would point out. The first is that we were at the end of the hallway and there are three doors at the end of the hallway plus the staff work room so it was quite noisy with people coming and going. I could hear the noise from the hall a lot while inside the room so I ended up putting a towel under the door to try to muffle outside noise a bit.The second negative is that the mini bar refrigerator has sensors in it and so if you even move something to fit in your leftovers (as we did) they know and you will be charged for it. Luckily I saw the note that tells you this and so called to remove the charges from the bill before we left. However, if i hadnt, i would have been charged for two drinks (over 15 dollars) that we didnt take. I understand the technology makes it easy for them but future occupants should be aware of this.A note to those considering this hotel: there is very little late night activity in the area. We were going to the film festival which ended after midnight and had to cab north to find somewhere to go after the movie had ended. That said, my husband continues to rave about the hotel and called it an A+ several times during the weekend. It is a lovely and comfortable hotel.

<Content>Loved the Millenium! I got a wonderful deal on the Millenium Hilton through Priceline. I only had 30 hours in the city and I'm so glad I stayed here. The concierge staff was wonderful and very helpful. The front desk, bell and doormen staff were all very friendly as well. The rooms were clean, stylish and stocked with all the right amenities, including a very cool plasma TV. Stayed on the 22nd floor with a birds-eye view of Ground Zero. The hotel is right across from the PATH station and right near the subway which was very convenient. Its location right off Broadway was also convenient for walking to where I needed to go.I'm heading back again next month and will definitely be staying hereagain.

<Content>Lovin the Millenium Hilton! Just back from a 4 day trip to New York City. From start to finish we had a ball. Flew out of Edinburgh on Friday morning so arrived lunchtime on Friday, just dropped off our cases and went shopping.Hotel was lovely, we stayed in a suite on 54th floor. Room was huge, very clean, loads of towels replaced daily and nice and clean.Never tried any of the restaurants in the hotel but the reception staff and the concierges were all very helpful. Starbucks is right around the corner and we had breakfast there daily which filled us up for the day almost. It's quite a walk to the shops but worth walking either up or back so see what you can't see from a taxi. Century 21 shop is right next door to the hotel and was cheap as chips! Estee Lauder, Chanel, Origins - they sell it all. Clothes and shoes also good bargains.We went to Woodbury Common outlet on Sunday - just jumped in a taxi and the taxi driver waited for us while we shopped and it meant we didn't have to carry our bags with us just dropped and shopped!Would definately recommend the Hilton - although its downtown its in a prime location for Path Station and we got the train to and from the airport which meant no trawling through traffic at the busy times.We'll definately go back there!!!!

<Content>Shame on you front desk staff! Obviously this hotel have a problem with the front desk staff, me and my family stayed here for one night the 21 April and we where really disappointed how the front desk staff treated us and the other guys who tried to check in. But if we forget that little problem then we must say that this hotel is still one of the best we have stayed at in the US. The rooms are really clean and comfortable and we liked that we had a corner room with a great view. We like that it鈥檚 possible to open a small window to hear all the sounds that New York have to offer. We stayed here last year and then we also had a really great stay.Take the train from Newark airport to WTC instead of using the really expensive and crazy driving taxi cars and save 50$ one way, there are service personnel at the ticketing machines at the airport who can help you to get the right tickets.

<Content>An outstanding experience! I stay at the Millenium Hilton for 3 nights (paying with the Hilton Honors Rewards plan). I got a huge corner room on the 49th floor, well equiped with a large TV (flat screen)  offering a level of confort that was above my expectations. Not saying the stunning view I had on the Brooklyn / Manhanttan Bridges and ground Zero.Breakfast was included in the reward (but would not have paid the extra 20 USD it costs). You have a Starbucks Coffee on the corner of the street/ opposite to Century 21. Outstanding service, staff always paid a lot of attention to my requests... I liked the location as well. Much less crowded than in Middtown/ Times Square. Very convenient as well for those who wish to have an easy access to SOHO, West/East Village. Be aware that Line E is sometimes not operating from the WTC subway station during the weekend due to reconstruction work. However, lot of alternatives remains available. Thumbs up for the Millenium Hilton Hotel that I would recommend to everyone!

<Content>Great hotel My husband and I stayed at the Millenium Hilton for 3 nights. We thought it was a great place. Staff was very friendly. The rooms were very clean and new. Our bed was exceptionally comfortable. We had a 38th floor view directly down on the World Trade Center site. This was quite sobering, but also gave us the opportunity to appreciate the magnitiude more than looking at it from ground level. As others have said, this is definitely a quieter part of the city. If you are looking for lots of action around you, this is not the part of town to stay in. However, there are several close subway stops and we found that almost any part of town could be reached within a 15 minute subway ride. We definitely would recommend the Millenium Hotel to anyone looking for top-notch accomodations in NYC.

<Content>Good Business Hotel Stayed there last week on business. The room had everything one would expect plus a large flat screen television.Room overlooked Ground Zero....I think most do. If you are interested in exercise you are close to Battery Park and the exercise path near the west side highway. I got 4 or 5 miles of jogging in without feeling stressed about dodging traffic.Lower Manhattan is still not right and certainly lacks the evening options of midtown. But if you must stay in the area this hotel works.

<Content>Great hotel, great area. I stayed at this hotel from Mar 31 - April 4th 2007. The hotel is of excellent quality. The lobby is gorgeous and the rooms are even nicer. The bathroom is roomy and comes equipped with Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries. The room I stayed in had 2 beds, as my party had 4 people. The beds are a bit too small for 2 people to sleep in, so we added a roll-away bed to give us more space. Requesting 2 rollaways was of no success, as they said it is a fire hazard. Understandable. The extra bed was 25 dollars a nite, but we were not charged due to my mother being a Hilton employee (at another Hilton). The room had internet access at 5 dollars a day. I did not find that unreasonable, at all, as the internet helped us get directions for where we were going each day. We had a view of ground zero out our window on the 29th floor. The first evening we were there we ate at the hotel restaurant, Church  Dey. The food was good, but expensive. I would not eat there again, but like I said - the food was good. The area the hotel is in is a quiet one - the financial district. It was nice to return to a quiet area after a long day of crowds.

<Content>An oasis in NY Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend sightseeing in New York.Firstly, it is downtown, near Wall Street and overlooks Ground Zero. It is away from the buzz of midtown which I liked. There is a subway stop directly outside the hotel main entrance which takes about 10 mins to get to Times Square.It is a skyscraper so rooms on the upper floors have fantastic views. Rooms are what I'd expect of a Hilton, clean, fairly spacious and modern with a massive flatscreen, not that I watched much TV. I didn't eat at the hotel other than one night I ordered room service which was prompt but expensive. I ate breakfast at the Panini deli just round the corner, try the pancakes!I would definitely stay here again as after a busy day uptown it was nice to come back to a quietish area.

<Content>Millenium Hilton - Great rooms! Great views! Grumpy Front desk people I've been flying to New York for business every few weeks. I'm trying to hit several different hotels in different areas I need to be in. This time I had several meetings in the Financial District so I booked this hotel. I knew the view would be great but maybe a little strange since the World Trade Center is no longer in front of it. You see, this hotel is located right behind where the World Trade Center used to be. I fly from Buenos Aires so it's a LONG 10+ hour flight. Even flying in Business Class to JFK is no comfort and after a long flight I like to go right to the room. I arrived very early around 6:30 am. I encountered a very grumpy middle aged man that didn't even offer a good morning. I gave him my name and reservation number and I also showed him my Hilton HHonors Gold VIP card. I have spent a LOT of money with Hilton hotels around the world but this didn't seem to matter to this guy. He didn't even look at it.I inquired about checking in early and he said no it's impossible. He didn't say anything like I'm sorry Mr. X all the rooms are occupied. Or any other explanation. He simply said that check-in is at 2 PM and that was that. It was only 6:30 am and I was exhausted since I didn't sleep on the long flight. I was going to wait in the lounge but the chairs are not comfortable and the lounge area really isn't that nice. I checked my bag and decided to go have breakfast and do some shopping.I stayed out until about 1 PM. I was a few blocks away but usually not in this area and I didn't know it well. I called the hotel to ask for directions and said I know I'm only a few blocks away...can you help. The guy that answered the phone said that he couldn't help and transferred me to what I'm assuming is the concierge desk and no one answered the phone. I was furious. I asked a police officer and he kindly pointed me in the right direction. I get to the hotel and it's 2 PM now. I see there is still no one at the concierge desk. It's very rude when a guest is calling to get directions and you simply transfer it to an empty desk. It would have taken him all of 10 seconds to explain where the hotel was.So I get to the front desk and they give me my key. I go to get my checked bag and I had a big bag plus all the bags I had from shopping (and I did a LOT of shopping). The bellboy (or I should say middle aged man) just handed me my suitcase and didn't even offer to help me take it to my room. This is extremely unprofessional.So this was 3 things now all before I even got to my room that I was not happy about. Someone definitely needs to do a customer service seminar for these employees. This is not a way to treat a customer that frequents their many hotels around the world. I get to my room and my bad mood goes away once I see the view. They put me on the 49th floor and I have an amazing view! It's very very strange to see the big hole where the World Trade Center was. I snapped some photos that I don't know if they will allow me to post on Trip Advisor since it's not the hotel but of the view. The room size is extremely big for a New York City hotel. I guess for the u$s 350+/night range you get mostly small hotel rooms here in NYC but this was very spacous with a King size bed. The room had a 42'inch Plasma/LCD TV which was a great touch. I do the same thing in my properties that I have for rent and people really appreciate these things. The bathroom was a good size as well. Nothing luxurious but it was at least spacious.The bed was extremely comfortable with great pillows as well. I stayed a few nights and used the room service and each time they were very quick. I'd say the food was delivered in less than 30 minutes each time. The food quality was ok as well. The prices on the menu don't seem too expensive but then remember they add on like $4 service fee + 15% tip which is also fairly common these days.I'm here getting ready to check-out. I must have just gotten a grumpy check-in guy. I just called down to let them know that I didn't use anything in my mini-bar and there were at least 4 things on my bill. The nice guy that answered (said his name was Robert) was very friendly and explained that the refrigerators have motion sensors that detect if you take something out. I did move some things around to put in some water that I had but put them back in. I thought that was interesting and never heard of that before so make sure you check your bills at the check-out.I asked Robert if I could have a late check-out and he said sure, no problem. What time did you want to check-out. I told him I just needed a few extra hours. 2 PM would be fine and he said not a problem. Now that is good customer service and very friendly. He sounded younger and was much friendlier than the grumpy old guy at the check-in.All in all, I'd highly recommend this hotel. If they got rid of the grumpy ole guy at the check-in and trained their staff to be a little friendlier than I'd say it's highly recommended.Mike

<Content>Very very nice We stayed here only one night but were impressed immediately upon entering the establishment. The staff was friendly and although we arrived a few hours earlier than check-in time, we were able to go straight to our room on the 24th floor. The view was absolutely breathtakingly beautiful yet sad (WTC) at the same time. The bed was so comfy and the bathroom was spacious and immaculate. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent hotel and helpful staff I used tripadvisor reviews to help chose this hotel for our stay in New York and was very pleased with the choice.The hotel is very comfortable, with everything you need for a great stay. The rooms were very modern with comfy beds, good coffee makers and marble bathrooms. The decor is modern and pleasant.We enjoyed a couple of early morning swims in the pool. When full of children (Saturday afternoon) the pool was bit less enjoyable, as it's really quite small.Once we'd worked out how to navigate the subway we found the hotel's location was excellent. It is easy to get to several subway lines, including the express which took us to Bloomingdales in only minutes.We only ate a couple of times at the hotel. Breakfast was much better and cheaper at the nearby Stage door deli. We had a very enjoyable dinner at the hotel restaurant, but it was comparatively expensive. The hotel staff were very helpful from the concierge who recommended a great restaurant one night and helped with directions and queries, to the front desk who helped me check in on line for our return flight.I would happily return to this hotel.

<Content>Good but some negative points Stayed for two nights on the 48th floor, overlooking the WTC site. Fantastic views and the room was a very generous size, including a small lounge area with a second TV, sofa and desk. The 42 plasma is certainly the largest screen I've seen in a hotel room but there is no inroom WiFi, just an ethernet cable connection that you pay for. You can detect over a dozen WiFi networks but you can't connect to them! The bathroom wasn't small either although the fittings looked a little dated. The bed was wide and very comfortable, with good pillows too. There's also a free safe which is always one of the main items I look for.The breakfast buffet was of a good standard but they have a la carte too. Dinner was slightly disappointing although that may have been due to my choice of dish. Costs aren't too high either.Negatives: the air-con system made a lot of noise, even when switched off. This may be a one-off and as I will probably stay here again for work, I shall update my review next time. The lack of WiFi, even if I could pay for it, was annoying, considering the typical guest is most likely a business traveller, judging by the occupants at breakfast. My final gripe is aimed at this and many other hotels; they all leave cards indicating their commitment to protecting the environment, asking you to reuse towels and save water etc. However, even if you don't leave towels in the bathtub, they still change everything every day! And it smacks of hypocrisy when they use 8 lightbulbs in the bathroom, although I did detect energy saving bulbs elsewhere in the room. The surrounding area is a bit shabby so take a taxi or the metro for your shopping and dining needs.Overall, it's a good hotel that could improve on a couple of areas but it's best suited to business travellers. Tourists are better off elsewhere.

<Content>reliable, comfortable, classy This was our 3rd stay at this hotel in 2 years. Every room has a great view and a great tv (and we don't watch much tv)! The lower Manhattan location is not a liability. There is great subway service or taxi's to midtown or beyond. From the hotel, you can easily walk to Chinatown ( we love NY Noodle Town, Bowery at Bayard). Strolling along the Hudson in Battery Park is wonderful and safe. NY is a great city and will not disappoint! To save money, park at the Gateway Hilton in Newark and take the PATH to NYC for $1.50 You will be right across the street from the Milennium..

<Content>Great Location This was my 3rd trip to NY and my 1st stay at The Millenium Hilton. I went to a congress in Westchester on March, 2 and 3 and my wife joined me after that for a whole week in the city. Wow, we had fun and the hotel was one of the reasons why we're still missing our week at The Big Apple. I had the warmest check in welcome of my life! Rooms, Housekeeping, Room Service, Front Desk, Staff in general, they're all fabulous! Liquis Assets Bar was also great for drinks before dinner. But, most of all, location seems to be the huge secret of the place. There are a few subway lines (some of them express lines) nearby which take you midtown or uptown in a few minutes (Lines 4  5 express trains). Anyway, the Financial Distric is very close to great spots like South Seaport, Soho, Lower East Side and even East and Greenwich Village. These are the places to go with their trendy restaurants and bars, nightlife and fun. But if you prefer the traditional touristic spots in Midtown and fancy the Upper East side...well, just take the 4 or 5 subway lines! There's a 4 storey shop just round the corner where you can buy almost everything to wear. Battery Park's also very close and there are some museums, bars and shops if you must stay downtown.Breakfast's very expensive though, but you can have it at so many places nearby.My wife and I will surely be back to this hotel next time we come to NY. Definately!Anna and Andre, Lisbon, Portugal

<Content>Almost perfect! I just came back from a stay at the Millenium Hilton and everything was almost perfect. I booked our stay through Hotwire. I booked a room for myself and one for my parents. We each got our rooms at 149$ and 153$ respectively. You cannot beat that price for the Millenium Hilton. We arrived by car and were really well received by the valet parking agent. A doorman helped us immediately with our luggage.I was anxious to see how the staff would act with us because our stay was booked through hotwire and that we had such a low price. There was nothing under 230$ if we booked through their website. The person at the front desk was professional and courteous and did not give us any attitude about the fact that we had not booked through them. We arrived at noon and we each got our rooms immediately.The rooms are spotless! We were located on the 31st and 33rd floors and had a view of Ground zero. Even my mother who is afraid of heights enjoyed the view! The rooms were always made up and bath products were replenished immediately.The only glitch I can find is that I had turn down service, with chocolates on the pillow and bottles of water, but my parents did not get it. The toilet made a dripping noise sometimes, but I just had to close the door and I did not hear it.I would recommand this hotel to everyone because with the subway and the buses, and walking also, you can get to anywhere in a short period of time. Book through Hotwire and you will save lots of money!

<Content>To Much Attitude and Bad Customer Service I stay at this hotel regularly for business. The attitude from the employees seems to get worse and worse each time. You would think you were staying in a posh boutique hotel in SOHO. The hotel itself is nice and rooms are great, but beware of the hotel staff!

<Content>Great Hotel This is my second time at this hotel. The last time I stayed was April 2006. The Hilton is located right across from the WTC site and was renovated after 9/11, it has all updated fixtures and flat screen TVs. They have reopened the main entrance in the last year and the lobby seemed much more put together since the last time I was there.The rooms are a good size by NYC standards and the view is tremendous (it鈥檚 interesting to see the construction of the WTC site). Its located next to the Fulton subway station and within three blocks you can get a subway to anywhere in NYC. My wife and I took advantage of the downtown location to explore some of the small museums in Lower Manhattan and had a great three days.There are plenty of pubs and bars in the Financial District and on Reade and Chambers street, but it is very much an after work crowd.I鈥檓 pretty self sufficient so I didn鈥檛 really have any contact with anyone who works there, nor did I need to, everything was very smooth.I recommend it for people who have business in the Financial District and people who are looking at staying in a different part of NY.I booked the room through Priceline.

<Content>New Years Stay at the Millenium We loved the Millenium Hilton. It's right across the street from Ground Zero which is very humbling but Americans need to be humbled every now and then right? Anyways, the hotel rooms are very nice and comfortable. The service is lacking. I'm sure its just the New Yorker way of life but they are always hurrying you and making you rush through, check in, check out, on the phone, etc. I wouldn't say they are rude but very in a hurry as all of New York is. We got tired waiting on the ball to drop on New Years so we just went back to the hotel and watched on TV and there were fireworks outside our window. It was great. The elevators are REALLY fast. Just a warning!

<Content>Loved the Millenium We stayed at this property for four nights in February. The employees couldn't have been more helpful (with the exception of the restaurant staff). Upon arrival, the front desk was friendly, courteous and informative. My husband's a diamond member, so we were upgraded to a Junior Suite, with complementary breakfast vouchers. The room was wonderful - actually two rooms, with a plasma tv, luxurious king bed with soft, quality linens and a housekeeping staff that couldn't have been more efficient. The room had a view of Ground Zero - this didn't bother us at all. It is quite sobering but also uplifting in seeing the way New Yorkers seem to be able to handle anything they're given. My respect and admiration truly goes out to the people of this city - it is truly the greatest city on earth! The consierge couldn't have been more helpful - any question you presented him with he answered, or at least tried. Elevators were prompt - rarely had to wait at all, going up or down. Yes, the lobby is small and the lounge could be a bit larger, but if this is the only thing wrong - please. The location of this hotel is just fine - a subway station 100 feet from the entrance. The subways are quite safe and a great way to get around, but if you're subway-shy, taxi's are abundant all around this hotel. However, we found it difficult getting one - we were there when the weather was quite cold and they all seemed to be occupied! So the subway it was, with no problems at all. Being downtown, I agree with a previous review wholeheartedly - it is quiet down here and away from the craziness of Times Square - you couldn't pay me to stay there! My only complaint towards this hotel is the miserable, bored, unhappy, unpleasant wait staff in the restaurant. And the breakfast ...... if we had to pay for that food....something like $29/person for a breakfast buffet that was as cold as ice coming directly from the kitchen! The eggs were stone cold, as was the bacon, sausage, potatoes, etc. My advice - go somewhere else - anywhere else - for breakfast. Never gave lunch or dinner a chance - too many other great restaurants in this city. We are planning another trip this April and we already have reservations to return here. This is a great hotel in a great city and I highly recommend it!

<Content>Perfect! This was our second time at this hotel at the beginning of February for two nights.We loved it the first time and when we booked to go back to new York we didn't even think twice of another hotel.Upon arrival were given a room on the 42nd floor overlooking ground zero with fantastic views over the river and skyline of new york.Rooms were very comfortable, not at all small compared to alot of new york hotels, with a very large comfortable bed and lots of bathroom toiletries.Check out was at 12 but unfortunately my husband was ill so after letting the conceirge know, they very kindly said we could stay in the hotel at no further cost until he was well enough to leave which was much appreciated.Overall fantastic hotel, great views and very accomodating staff!

<Content>Will Never Stay Here Again The rooms here are large and nice, and the views are remarkable but not nearly enough to make up for the awful service I received 2/15-2/17/07. Upon arrival the doorman did not come to the curb to assist me with my luggage - normally this wouldn't be a big deal to me but with the wind gusting and snow on the ground, it irked me this time.My room was large, clean and well-appointed. All was well until I attempted to open the mini-bar, which was stuck. A call downstairs informed me that they had problems with that particular room and would send someone right up. Maintenance arrived within 10 min but it's annoying not to be told of the problem in advance when management knows about it.On my second evening I had trouble establishing an internet connection; again, a call downstairs informed that particular room doesn't have internet connectivity and they offered to move me to another room. At this point I spoke to the manager who denied that anyone had any prior knowledge of the lack of internet connection in that particular room - whatever - I went ahead and moved rooms. I checked out Saturday morning at 6:30am and asked the desk clerk whether I would be able to hail a cab at that hour or if I was better off calling for one. I was told that the doorman (who was nowhere to be seen at that moment) could hail a cab for me. It's 6:30am on a SATURDAY, there is NO ONE else in the lobby, yet the desk clerk seems to feel it's beneath his station to accommodate my request for help in getting a cab.I will never stay here again - the service and attention to detail is minimal at best, and the staff is barely apologetic when their lack of attention causes disruption to their guests.

<Content>Nice! Got a deal on Priceline for a Saturday evening getaway. The hotel was redone in 2003 after being damaged on 9/11. My room on the 31st floor directly overlooked the WTC site. So if that bothers you, ask for another side. The hotel is directly across the street from it and is close to the subway, very convenient. It's also next to Century 21, if you are interested in shopping.The room was very comfortable, with great lighting options and soft sheets on the great bed. It also had an in-room safe in the closet, which I didn't use because I didn't bring my laptop with me, but it's something I look for since I usually have a computer and hate checking it at the front desk or hauling it with me. The only drawback to the room I had (3103) was that there seemed to be some noise in the room from the elevators. It took me a while to figure out where it was coming from. And my neighbors were quiet, but when they returned to their room, I could hear them pretty clearly. So it's not the most soundproof room ever. Wish it was a little quieter, esp. if you're paying closer to the regular rate.But the room was very clean and nice, and I would definitely stay again if I got a decent rate!

<Content>Spacious (for downtown NY) room with a view New York is one of the few cities where I consistently book my hotels through Hotwire, or a similar service, simply because I get value for my dollar in a city where hotel prices are exorbitant. I have yet to be disappointed.The staff were wonderfully friendly, and the room was clean and attractively furnished. In fact, it was unusually spacious for its location. It had a huge flat-screen TV, nice amenities, and a sweeping but sobering view of Ground Zero. A friend who visited commented that she would find it difficult to look down at that view every day. I, however, was moved by what I saw and was thankful for being able to see the entire vista of where the Towers once stood, from high above the ground.The downside, as a tourist, is that a downtown location like this can seem remote at times. I would definitely return to the hotel, especially if I had to conduct business downtown.

<Content>Can't lose with this one I'm adding to the chorus of accolades. We've stayed in Times Square before and won't do it again after staying downtown.The Millenium Hilton was like an oasis after busy days and nights on the town. You are close to SOHO and a fairly short subway ride to midtown. The subway station could not be more convenient. At first, it's a little strange being neighbors to the World Trade Center site...it will fill up your view out the window. But I certainly wouldn't let that fact discourage anyone from staying here. The rooms are huge by NYC standards and we loved the enormous plasma screen tv and the no-attitude friendly service. By the way, we got this on Priceline for what we considered a great rate.

<Content>Declining but still OK for NYC. I stayed at the Millenium Hilton in NYC five times between 2003 and 2006 and still appreciate this hotel even if it used to be better a couple of years ago. First I like the modern and original architecture of the hotel; then the location in the financial district and on walking distance to the seaport is convenient; the rooms are well-decorated, modern and big enough; the service at front desk is good and the concierge very helpfull. But during my last stays I noticed that the room-prices went up quite a bit and that the value-for-money is not so good anymore as it used to be. Plus their were some anoying works in the lobby and the main entrance was closed. The lobby is indeed very small for this huge hotel and seems now a bit outdated - a renovation would be welcome. Finally I was disapointed by the breakfast which used to be good but now the waiters simply don't care about you at all and I have been waiting at the bar 15 minutes before a table was ready (even if their were plenty of empty uncleaned tables) ... Millenium Hilton is still OK if you need to stay in the financial district but you should find as good or even better elsewere in NYC.

<Content>Loved It! I loved the Millenium Hilton. The rates were great and the hotel was beautiful and clean. Great rates for weekend getaway. Located in the financial district but only a cabride away from main attractions. This location was great because you don't hear the busy NYC streets and sirens. Staff was great. Beware of roomservice and breakfast it was very pricey. I would def stay there again.

<Content>Minted quick simply a total dream from day 1. i apsolutely loved this place. me and my girlfriend stayed from 30th dec to 4th jan and dont have 1 negative comment to make. The rooms are spotless and decor is very classy for the price. Our bed was fantastic too :) Overall i recommend this hotel. Only slight drawback is the financial district location. Just grab a C train and your in Uptown in minutes.

<Content>Twice is a charm We had another opportunity to come to NYC.This time in winter. Hmmm how 'bout staying in midtown where all the action is...mmmm ok but where? ....Radisson Lexington. BIG MISTAKE! (another story)Opps we hasilty retreated from midtown and rebooked our favourite NYC place to stay.It's real simple. It's an elegant place...slightly upscale, close to all major city highlights...subways at your door (just to get back to midtown!)Always spotless.The only drawback was the fire alarm @ 12:30 am, on the last night we were there. And being on the 51st floor a bit unnerving to say the least. However the management quickly and efficiently rectified the situation (while I peered out the window down to see the fire platoons arrive and then slowly leave). We didn't sleep well after that. But the beds are so comfortable and the decor up to date. Staff are friendly every time you walk in. Stay there again?? in a heartbeat - maybe on a lower floor next time!

<Content>Style, Space and Hospitality My wife and I booked the Millenium for a weekend getaway before Xmas. We chose this based on good reviews and because it was one of the more reasonable accomodations given that we were smack in the middle of the holidays. We couldn't have been happier with our choice.Positives* Our room was quite spacious particularly in NYC where I have stayed in rooms which I could touch all 4 walls. * We had a beautiful view overlooking the WT Center site and across the river. * Plasma TV was great, bathroom clean, and bed quite comfortable. * The front desk staff were professional and efficient which is all I need. Get me in and get me out. * The concierge was attentive to everyone - he offered us advice on how to get to the play we were seeing, sites we were interested in and suggestions on where to eat. All were excellent. Also held our luggage on checkout day so we could do some extra sight seeing.Negatives* There was a bit of riff raff that hung around outside the hotel selling junk but it's a city so what do you expect - we never felt threatened. * Parking is outragous. We spent 85 bucks for under 2 days not including tip. * The hotel is about as far downtown as you can go without being in NJ which for some might be a drawback. However, the train and Path are right outside the hotel and fairly easy to navigate - ask someone if you need help. The first time an attendant walked us through the whole ticket process, told us where to go etc. from then on we had no problem. (The train isn't as nice or easy to use as Wash DC Metro but it was fine. I recommend an all day pass its like 7 bucks and after 2 rides you basically make your money)All in all this was a fantastic trip and I would not hesitate to suggest this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great City We stayed in the Millenium Hilton from the 29th of December through to the 8th of January. Firstly, the connections to everthing here are excellent, we took the subway to and from the airport, it only takes 45 mins not sure how long a cab takes but it is around $45, the subway is 2. The subway is also excellent for getting uptown with the 'E' dropping you right next to Macys in 34th or times square at 42nd or right up to the rockerfeller on 53rd all for 2 bucks, if your making a couple of trips a day as we did it saves alot of money on 15 - 20 buck cabs.The hotel was excellent we never had to wait long to check in and as I had requested on the hilton website when booking I got a high floor room on the 49th floor. Our room over looked ground zero out to new jersey, the view was excellent, we found that the noise was no problem unless you opened the window, though the air conditioning unit was noisy at night. The pool and sauna were nice though the buisness suite with the internet for hire was expensive, try to find an internet cafe. The only complaint I have is not to do with the hotel as such but the location I found to be a bit of a hassle, though the subway is right outside, if you were shopping up 5th avenue or in around times squre it was a bit of a trek to come back to the hotel for a change of clothes or to drop off bags etc, it was also harder to find pubs and resteraunts within walking distance.Overall though i would definatly recommend the hotel.

<Content>Great Stay at the Millenium Hilton My stay at the Hilton Millenium was great! The room was clean and fortunately we were able to stay in one of the larger rooms on our floor. It is quiet on weekend mornings and the noise from Ground Zero was never a problem. The staff was always polite. Very convenient to the subway. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Oh, and when searching for a hotel I had a hard time finding one that didn't have a review stating there were bed bugs. The Millenium Hilton was one of the few-no bed bugs in our room!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel with city views...... Booked this hotel for 7 nights (27th Dec to 3rd Jan) after reading the reviews on trip advisor......Our room was a King Bed room on the 33rd Floor with City views ( inc. WTC site ) Yes it does get a bit noisy daytime, but NYC is noisy all the time. AirCon fan was noisy, but liveable ( others have said the same ) but the 42 Plasma TV worked fine. Room was always spotlessly cleaned and the service was faultless.It is a bit 'Downtown' for most of NYC's attractions, but the cab rides were on average $15 (inc. tip ), the most we paid was $25 from Times square to the hotel in rush hour. When you've paid about $250 a night.... you can live with that.....Mostly had 'breakfast' in Starbucks, round the corner.Had room service breakfast on our last morning and it was OK. ( $40 all in )Don't use the hotel phone to ring the UK, about 拢7.50 for 2-3 mins...!!!!Overall impressed enough to go back again soon........Times Square NewYearsEve was a one-off experience..........Easily got a cab back to the hotel at 1am NewYearsDay and it cost.........$12+tip..........only in NYC........ :o)

<Content>Way Downtown But Great Nonetheless! A wonderful hotel with comfortable beds and wide screen TV. It's right opposite Ground Zero so those who lost folks may want to find somewhere else to stay. Right near Chambers Street subway stop. All around great experience and paid only about $218 through Hotwire!! One caveat - the mini-bar is rigged with some sensor so even if you just LIFT an item to look it, it'll be recorded as a taken item.

<Content>Great Stay Eventually booked this hotel through another website other then hilton, and saved myself a few hundered pounds. Being a hilton gold card member, I was expecting an upgrade to a higher floor but on checkin I was allocated the 19th floor. I was not very happy with this and I expressed my dissapointment to the checkin staff, who after about 10mins managed to upgrade me to the 46th floor. We had a one bedroom junior suite which was at the south west corner of the hotel. Ecellent views of the WTC and west to NJ and south. Could not fault the room, it was always cleaned and tidied to a very hight standard, and was very very comfortable.We never ate in the hotel, due to past reports decided to take the extra points, and use the deli just across the street, and, I'm pleased we did. You have a wide variety of choice and the service was very efficient. The hotel did not seem to mind that we brought breakfast back into the hotel to eat either.Had room service from the hotel on one occasion and that was very efficient and well presented.As you have probably read from other reports the hotel has great travel connections with the subway wherever you want to go. The 3 north bound subways can be accessed within a 2 minute walk from the hootel so no complaints there, and $24 for a week pass is a bargin the amount we used it.Over all a very enjoyable say and an excellent Hilton experience, would highly reccommend!!!

<Content>Worst Staff in Town The hotel is nice but the employees, including the managers, were all rude and unhelpful. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and had a wonderful view, but our stay was riddled with constant disappointment caused by the ineffective way this hotel is run. Our concierge told us she was obtaining tickets for us and never made calls on our behalf - we called the venue directly and found out she had never called and we almost lost seats because we were depended on her to follow through. The non-smoking suite was filled with smoke from other rooms (on the non-smoking floor). The place was noisy and check in and out was ridiculously difficult. We visit NY several times a year and will never stay at the Millenium again - stay away if you care about service!

<Content>Noise We spent five days at the Millenium Hilton and while it served it's purpose and is well served by many subway lines, I don't think we'd stay again. The staff/service were adequate (not great), and the walls are surprisingly thin (we could hear our neighbours phone conversations/tv) and with construction having begun at the WTC site, it can get pretty noisy quite early. If you plan to stay, definately ask for a room as high up as possible. We found the WTC construction quite loud at times even though we stayed on the 53rd floor.

<Content>Pleased with this Hotel Stay Stayed in this hotel for four nights in mid-November. This was a business meeting/pleasure trip. Two of the nights were a Friday and Saturday . We were located on the 49th floor. I give the location, room and service high marks. I required maintenance on the first day to replace a faulty showerhead. This was done promptly. I would definitely stay again. Some of the external positives include convenient subway stations which get you to Soho and even Times Square in less than 25 minutes. There is a well-known electronics store a couple blocks away as well as a discount retailer across the street. There are plenty of cheap eats down Church Street or Broadway. City Hall is nearby. This is a unique location with the WTC site across the street, the riverviews are great and you get a certain feel that is different from midtown. Overall a pleasant experience.

<Content>Honneymooners Beware!!! My wife and I just left The Millennium Hotel in NYC from our brief Honeymoon and I must say how dissatisfied we were with the service we received at the Exclusive 4-Star hotel. Upon our arrival I made arrangements with the gentlemen at the front desk to have a car pick my wife and I up from our Wedding Night Dinner Cruise. This was after upon check-in that the bellhop failed to make the arrangements for us as promised. Time and location were supplied to Arturo and I was assured that there would be a car waiting for us when we docked. When we arrived there was no car. In fact I had to walk approx. 6 blocks in the cold rain to hail a cab back to the hotel, exactly what I wanted to avoid by arranging a car with your hotel. After arriving back to our room we found that there was no heat. Because we were both exhausted and wanting to go to sleep we did not want to make an issue of it because we did not want to change rooms at that time. I believe that our mistakes were having such high expectations from such a prestigious company. That mistake will never be made again, for we will no longer stay at a Hilton affiliated hotel again. I'm afraid that if the disappointing service we experienced at the 4-Star rated Millennium Hilton is the norm I wonder how it is in other not so exclusive facilities under the Hilton Umbrella. Overall they give you a 鈥渟orry鈥?and send you on your way without any recourse. At the end of the day we鈥檇 rather stay at the Marriott.

<Content>Efficient, priced to compete, stylish rooms We chose the Millenium Hilton for our weekend in NYC because our rate, which included two breakfasts AND one night of champagne, was about $150 cheaper than the celestial rates of Times Square / Midtown properties WITHOUT breakfast.We were worried that being so far downtown would make transportation difficult, but with a subway station across the street, we had no problem most of the time; Saturday night cabs were scarce and the hotel only had one doorman on, so we left the long taxi line and hoofed up one block to catch our own - no big deal.We appreciated other TripAdvisor guest photos of the site, as it is across the street from the WTC site - the hotel itself was damaged in the 9/11 attacks and was closed for 18 months. (Now beautifully restored - no issues). The bellman told us a harrowing story of the day of the attack and his subsequent 9 hour walk home to the Bronx. This location, then, becomes a positive - the staff are happy to see you and grateful for your business, and you can walk a few steps out the door to see the moving WTC display or explore St. Paul's chapel, the 18thC church which miraculously survived the collapse of the towers.The room was better appointed than most brands, with a huge, flat-screen TV and glass and wood furniture. Room a little on the small side for two women who spent three days shopping, but then again, what hotel room would have held all the bags? OUTSTANDING bed.Our room overlooked WTC site, and the other side of the hotel overlooks the Brooklyn Bridge. Overall a very pleasant experience.

<Content>Pleasant stay with a few blips.. When you pay $400 (including taxes) a night at a five-stay hotel like this one, expectations run very high. Generally, our stay at this place was pleasant. The room was well spaced out and well maintained, the plasma TV was a plus. The blips:- breakfast was ok, though the standard (of the food) has dropped since our last stay two years ago. Service was inconsistent - some of the staff greeted guests with smiles and quick directions; others appeared nonchalant and looked away while making greetings (saying have a pleasant day ahead with a stoned expression while looking away does not count as service to me). My advice: don't go through the motion if you don't mean what you say.- Lost a spectacle holder the day I checked out (it had apparently fell behind one of the cupboards, according to my friend who stayed with me). Called the housekeeping who couldn't locate it. Went to the front desk a few hours later to check again. Saw front desk person called housekeeping, laughed and shook his head while talking, out down the phone and said Sorry, they couldn't locate it. Felt insulted that a matter like this was treated lightly. Friend adviced that small items like mine are always dispensables in hotels like this - you will never get it back. Didn't accept the reason and felt robbed.Otherwise, the hotel was a pleasant stay with a nice view of the Hudson River skyline.

<Content>Expensive but beautiful I liked our stay at the Hilton because it was beautiful but certainly not because of the staff or rediculous prices. I found one doorman to be very nice, the others would sit and count their tips infront of us, flag us down a cab and then expect a tip and give us dirty looks when he didnt recieve one. I also found that the food their was rediculously expensive if you even touched one on the food items in the dressers it was an automatic charge, which is not right especially since a chocolate bar was $8. We also didnt want to pay for the drinks in our fridge because a can of pop was $4 FOR A CAN OF POP. We purchased our own drinks at a drug store and put them in the fridge after taking the other drinks out. Later that night a employee came to our rooms to tell us that we had to take our drinks out of the fridge and put theirs back where they came from in exact order or we would be charged for every drink in the fridge, Arent we paying enough to stay here as it is,we cant even have a cold drink unless we pay a hugely overpriced amount for one drink! they also told us that we could have a fridge brought up to the room for an additional $100 to store out own drinks in, YA RIGHT. Anyways i was dissappointed with the hotel. Although it was beautiful I will not go back.

<Content>Just Perfect No problems at all. Room was on the 47th floor which took the elevator 25 seconds to get to (your ears pop). Room overlooked WTC, so if that an issue for you then best to avoid. Staff very pleasant and helpful when we needed them. Outside the door is the subway, next door is Century 21, opposite was the PATH train for getting from Newark to Hilton, took 40 minutes and cost only $8, we were lucky with the connections mind you. Plasma is a bonus, rubbish on US TV with adverts every 5 minutes meant we never really watched it though!The biggest point given that we were out all day was the most comfortable bed that they claim was just that. I have never slept in a more comfortable bed in my puff.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel but a Couple of Negatives I booked 2 quad-accupancy rooms for a group of us who headed down to NYC for the Labour Day long weekend. The hotel itself has an upscale feel to it and has one of the fastest elevators I have ever experienced.Both rooms were located on the east side of the building, facing town hall and the Brooklyn Bridge, although the later is only visible from the highest floors and were not visible to us (31st and 32nd floors). The rooms were well appointed, spacious and the large-screen plasma TVs made viewing a pleasure.Several of the group has stayed mid-town on previous trips and enjoyed staying downtown, away from the hordes of tourists congregating in Time Square, Central Park and 5th Av. However, it is a ghost-town after all the white collars head home on Friday, giving it somewhat of a depressing feel when you are the only soul out walking around in the early morning or late evening. Its location across from Ground Zero doesn't really help much either... For all of the compliments, we did have two complaints. First, for a quad-occupancy room, beds were very small, making for an intimate sleeping encounter whether you wanted it or not. If you want the possibility of moving around without falling out of the bed (or accidently knocking your partner out), better upgrade to a junior suite.Secondly, because of flight delays, one of our group arrived at the hotel after our party had already headed uptown. Although the front desk assured us that it would be no problem to provide her access to the room in our absence, it turned out to be a different story. Only after half an hour and three attempts did they finally provide her with an access key.All in all, a wonderful hotel although there were several aspects which kept it from being a great stay.

<Content>Best value in NYC Wanting to get away for the weekend to NYC, we booked this hotel after many positive reviews here on tripadvisor, and I don't think we'll stay at any other NYC hotel. For the price this hotel can't be beat.Interestingly, the only downside to the hotel is its location. It's way down next to the WTC, meaning it's at the tip of southern Manhattan. But that's OK because the hotel is right outside the entranceway to the WTC subway stop on the E train. My wife and I arrived by bus at Penn Station (also on the E line), and a few stops later, was at the door to the Hilton. Plus, all the hotspots in Manhattan are served on the blue (A, C, E) line: Times Square, Columbus Circle/Central Park, Empire State Building, etc. Can't beat the convenience.Service was impeccable. We asked room service to send up toothpaste, and in timely fashion, a gentleman arrived at our door with the goods. A few minutes after that, we got a phone call from Housekeeping asking us if the toothpaste was delivered. Was a nice touch since this was the first time I had ever experienced a follow-up call, and I've stayed at many more upscale hotels.We got a king-size bedroom and as a previous poster noted, the window view was of the WTC construction site. Unlike the previous poster, I couldn't hear a thing outside our window, and we were on the 20th floor, so not too high up. Noise was not a problem.The room was a little on the small side, but that is to be expected in Manhattan. The decor was modern, and the plasma TV was a very nice touch (not to mention space saving!). The bathroom and bedsheets were all clean...no complaints.I can't speak of the restaurant or the hotel food because we didn't eat at the hotel. Why would you when the corner breakfast shop tastes better and is cheaper than any hotel fare? Just spend the day walking up broadway and you'll walk through many shops and restaurants as you pass through all the hotspots in lower Manhattan/midtown.Overall, this hotel was a real find. It was one of the cheapest hotel options in Manhattan, one of the most convenient, and we came away with no complaints about it. It's not the Ritz, the Waldorf, or the Trump, but it doesn't cost it either.

<Content>Timmy's 40th Birthday Stay Firstly, my husband's 40th birthday was on Sept. 16, 2006 but I wanted to plan something special - like getting a few of his childhood buddies to come from their homes (1 in FLA, 1 in ME and 1 in CA) for a 40th b'day dinner at City Hall Restaurant which is very close (by foot) to The Millenium Hilton. I booked 2 suites online and called to confirm and spoke w/a lovely representative who made sure that it was noted once all arrived at the hotel that this was a special ocassion. After a spectacular dinner at City Hall Restaurant, our 4 yr old son and I went to one of the suites on the 38th floor and it was FABULOUS! My husband and his pals followed after their rendezvous of night caps following their dinner. The staff was helpful, knowledgeable and quite friendly. Room service was great and the amenities wonderful - let alone our view was breath-taking! (I do have a few pixs - mostly of myself and our son looking out of one of the windows). My husband and his buddies were very, very pleased to say the least. We reside in NYC and I was very, very pleased that I chose the Millenium Hilton which made my husband's 40th birthday bash a memorable one, indeed :-) I recommend it highly! Sincerely, Yvette Allen-Janis

<Content>Smoker Beware Let me begin by saying we had another very nice stay at this hotel. The rooms are still small but great and the staff is very friendly and accomodating. If you are a smoker and insist on a smoking room you would be better off trying another hotel. I had reserved my smoking King room 2 months previously. Upon arrival alas there were no smoking rooms. Evidently Hilton removed a bunch of smoking floors and, of course, did not let their smoking guests know about this. There is now 1 floor that is smoking with 14 rooms on it. That means 14 out of 569 rooms are smoking rooms. Even if you book one of these rooms you are not guaranteed to get one as per the Manager of the hotel told me. The odds are pretty bad. Otherwise it's still a fine hotel. This review is just a caution to the 22% of Americans who smoke.

<Content>Not the best PROS: Very clean and comfortable rooms, friendly staff, widescreen plasma tv (no high-definition broadcasts though), very comfortable beds/pillows, excellent climate control, great view either side (if you don't mind looking at ground zero on the hudson river side [they refer to over-looking ground zero as city view]), pool and excercise room, easy subway access to everywhere.CONS:No king beds facing away from ground zero, only queen (which looked like full size), construction on ground zero 7 days a week from about 6:00 am to 3:00 pm (muffled noise), no coffee in rooms (have to go to restaurant to purchase and coffee was not good and not hot), no in-room refrigerator, charge for high-speed internet access (no wireless in rooms), walls not as sound-proof as other hotels (fine unless you have noisy people next to you or want to sleep in on ground zero side).If this hotel added a few MINOR ammenities like FREE in-room coffee and refrigerator and FREE wireless internet access, I would have felt better about the construction noise and the price. The way they nickel and dime I was surprised that they didn't charge to use the toilet. Penny-wise and pound foolish. Overall a comfortable, somewhat noisy average stay. C+

<Content>awesome room, awesome view We had booked the room through Hotwire so we expected to get a broomcloset next to the ice machine. Surprise, we got a lovely room on the 53rd floor with a spectacular view of the Brooklyn Bridge. We sat at our window and watched all the lights come on at dusk -- it was more than amazing.Our room was small but clean and modern. Large plasma TV, comfortable bed, Crabtree and Evelyn shampoo, conditioner, etc., wallsafe, and comfortable easy chair.Staff could not have been nicer.Even on the weekend the area was alive with street vendors and tourists bustling about. Many subway lines within walking distance. Broadway bus (southbound) 1 block away.

<Content>Well Worth It!! I went for a week-end in the city. I stayed on the 47 th floor with a spectacular view of the city both day and night the veiw is breath taking. I suggest a jr. suite its not that much $ for what you get. and you can have up to 5 people in the room with out paying extra per person. The front desk staff was amazing ,funny and gave honest advice.The minibar system is this hotel s weak point Dont take the key .The gift shop has an ATM that only despense $100 at a time so just walk to the corner and use that atm if you need MORE cash . here is a great tip parking is around $48-$58 a night at the hotel but if you are there for the week -end you can park on the street FREE. and week days there is a parking garage around the corner for under $15 a day if you get it validated at sysms. Also there is a great pizza shop across the street if you want a bite or on a budget. the indoor pool is pretty small ,but very nice one thing that stuck out to me was that for a hotel in manhattan it was exteremly clean. i will and i am staying here again. also sign up to become a hilton honors member and get specials and deals on rooms even in nyc.you can bring your ipod and play your i tunes on the radio cool i loved it you will too.

<Content>Very Nice Overnight Although I stayed for 1 night I will def. be back the next time I stay in NYC. I only live about 45 mins away but stay often on weekends and this was just perfect. I booked a bounceback weekend rate so the breakfast buffet was included at a rate of $209. A good buffet, typical eggs, french toast, bacon, fruits, cereals, bread, etc. The room and bathroom were a nice size for two people and extremely clean! Everything seemed brand new, including the large plasma tv. The room service was very prompt and accurate and every staff member we encountered was super friendly. I, too, did have a view of where the world Trade Center was. I was just left in awe but didn't feel depressed as another review wrote. I am lucky enough to have a family member that survived that terrible ordeal so maybe that is why. There is a ton of construction downtown but didn't hear anything that disupted our night at all. Would def. recommend a stay here.

<Content>Millenium Hilton-a great business hotel I stay at this hotel constantly since it incredibley convenient to the Finacial District and I find it a terrific busness hotel. All of my needs are met in terms of health club, pool, bar and restaurant plus the rooms are well maintained, very well equipped and imaculatley clean. The best feature of this hotel is the staff who are universally friendly, helpful and willing to assit with any request. An overlooked apsect of this hotel is its proximity to some fine dinning just a few blocks walk or a short cab ride north to Tribecca, etc.; we found the doorman and concierge a wealth of good referrals!

<Content>Amazing View! My husband and I went to the Hilton for our anniversary, and when we checked in we told them. We booked the romance package, including champagne, strawberries and chocolate and full american breakfasts.We arrived on the room and we saw that they upgraded us to the corner, meaning a mini-suite, with a small living room plus an amazing bedroom with view on the 23th floor of the hotel looking at the ground zero.We were really happy of the room.Now, for the breakfast I was disappointed that there is only buffet and not a menu!We went for dinner to this amazing brasserie two blocks away from the hotel, calling Les Halles, we had an excellent dinner for not too expensive!! recommended!!

<Content>Ground Zero vista Nice price for a 4 star. Worth it to get a city view room, which is an extra $40, but puts you at least 38 floors up. Pool is indoors and on the small side. Plasma TV, clean quiet rooms,kind of small have been newly redone. Super comfy bed, friendly staff. Watch out for the minibar sensor which charges $10 to the room if you open it longer than 30 seconds. They took the charges off no problem. 24 hour roomservice is a bonus. No AAA rates, but reasonable. The view of Ground Zero is dramatic, and directly overlooks it as well as the Hudson River and points west. Definately would stay there again.

<Content>Less than desirable We booked our hotel and was quite excited to be able to stay in Manhattan, at a four-star hotel at a Hilton hotel. Prior to check-in we had requested a king size smoking room both on the internet and by the phone. When we finally moved our way through closed streets and quite a bit of construction and got our car parked ($48.00 a day - no in and out), they did have us in a king size room but it was a non-smoking room. Supposedly they did not have a smoking room available but the gentleman at the front desk left us for a few minutes and voila! A smoking room was suddenly available. We got to our room and my husband and I were really excited to see what type of view we would have. We were able to see the Hudson and some of the skyscrapers on the financial district but the main eye-catching site was that of ground zero. It was quite depressing and bone-chilling to look out our window. Wireless internet is available at the hotel. When using the lounge near the front desk, it's $5.95 AN HOUR. In your room, it ranges from $5.95 to $9.95 for a 24 hour period. I have noticed no difference between the $5.95 and the $9.95 service so don't waste your money on the $9.95 option.The room itself is nice. The beds at their sister hotel, Hampton Inn, are a lot more comfortable. The beds have a duvet that covers it with no duvet cover. The plasma television is nice but not that big of a deal. Breakfast is not provided by the restaurant but you are able to order a continental breakfast for $18.00 plus a 15% gratuity and a $4.00 in-room dining charge. There are also no soda vending machines on any floor but you are able to purchase a fountain drink in the lounge for $3.75. It is in a good subway location. There are two subway entrances right across the street and are easily accessible. Beware of walking up Fulton Street towards Broadway or you'll get accousted by all the street vendors selling knock-off merchandise.Overall, I'm not impressed with this 4-star hotel at all. Give me the 2 1/2 star ones any day.

<Content>Best Stay! I just returned from an over night stay at the Millenium Hilton and I have to say that it far exceeded my expectations. I did book through a discount website and so it didnt hurt that the room was 50% off of the regular rate. This was the deal of a lifetime. We scored a very spacious corner room with a great view facing north east. We had a great view. The beds were exceptionally comfortable complete with down comforters and pillows. The huge plasma TV was awesome as well. Travellers should know that the west facing side of the building directly faces ground zero. As a New Yorker who lived here during 9/11 I found the location saddening but also felt really good about staying at the hotel and contributing to the rebirth of lower Manhattan. The indoor pool (surrounded by potted palm trees) was fabulous as was the extremely courteous and helpful staff. Truth be told, I didnt want to leave! Two thumbs up!

<Content>Very good hotel, especially if you get a good rate I booked this hotel for a long weekend in July, primarily because of the many good reviews on tripadvisor.com, and I wasn't disappointed. This is mainly a business hotel, because of its location in lower Manhattan, and it costs over $300 a night during the week. You can however get some very good weekend rates: I ended up paying $189 per night plus taxes, which is very good value for a 4 star hotel in Manhattan.The room was very clean and well decorated in a modern style. The bed was very comfortable. The plasma TV was a nice touch.I was a little bit concerned that the location would be dead on the weekend, but there were several good deli-style cafes in the area for brunch. The open-top tour buses stop right beside the hotel and the Staten Island ferry terminal, Brooklyn Bridge and Battery Park are all pretty close. The subway is right by the hotel and I did take quite a few taxis to other parts of Manhattan, which were plentiful and not too expensive.I did order room service one night after midnight and the sandwiches and burger we received were OK but very expensive.The staff were friendly and efficient on check-in and check-out.I would recommend this hotel for a weekend visit to New York, if the price is right.

<Content>4th july at milennium Disappointed to begin with, lots of road works going on not only at the hotel but in the area in general. Check-in was quite quick, however when asking to be changed to the romantic package for our 10th anniversary we were told that as it was not the package we booked on the internet they could not change it.Hotel room was very nice. Bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Room was quickly cleaned in the morning however glasses etc removed from our room set outside the door for 2 days!! Breakfast was great really set us up for the day - though they only had fresh strawberries on weekdays - what was that about?? Dinner was also quite good -(but much too expensive) we ended up eating in the restaurant 3 out of 5 nights of our stay as we weren't very well organised and there were very few restaurants opened in the financial district later in the evening and at the weekend. Pool was in general quite good although very small and only really suitable for 3/4 at any time.

<Content>Dosen't Get much better for the price After reading many reviews and looking at many hotels in the NYC area, i decided to stay at the Millenium Hilton. I arrived to the hotel by subway which is located steps away from the front door of the building. This was great, seeing as the subway transportation takes you to practically everywhere. I then arrived at the hotel an hour before check-in and they did not have my room ready, they then told me they would upgrade my room to a suite at no cost to me. I gladly accepted. I got to the room and it was perfect. Everything from wrap around view of the city and Ground Zero to the 40 inch Plasma television. 20 mins after being in the room the front desk called to make sure everything in the room was ok and see if we needed anything at all. They said when ever we were ready to go to sleep they would come and pull out our pull out couch for us that was in the living room. Everyone at the hotel was extremely NICE and happy and did anything and everything to make our stay more pleasent. I diffently recommend this hotel.

<Content>Stay over weekend at the Millenium First thing which immediately became obvious was the roadworks outside causing issues with actually getting into the hotel. Once there though I was met by polite reception staff and bag was whisked up to my run. I'd been upgraded to a room on the 48th floor. The Bell boy seemed very excited about the room and said it was his favourite. I suspected he would say that about all the rooms, but when I got there I could see why - The view as amazing a corner room overlooking Brooklyn River and Bridges and out of another window the Statue of Liberty. Room service was ok and efficient. No complaints about the Restaurant (I only had breakfast) but all efficiently served. The door staff were fantastic - polite keen to server helping out with taxis and advice. There is something about the hotel though. I've stayed here on a couple of occasions and I think its the hallways. The doors into the room appear to be made of metal and as you walk down the hallways it looks like you are walking down a row of prison doors. Interior of rooms have certainly been upgraded since last time I came to the millenium. Large plasma screen tv was nice touch. Contemporary furniture beginning to look a little dated already. Small/average size of room for Manhatten. I travel on business to NY frequently and the hotel is respectable but certainly not my first choice for a stay, however it has improved since refurb work

<Content>Average I just completed a stay at the Millenium Hilton down in the Financial District. I have stayed in plenty of hotels and this one was average in comparison. The air was not working very well and when we called an engineer up there he just said it was because the curtains weren't closed and the sun was coming in. So we closed the curtains and went out for the evening, we came back in at 11p and it was still hot even though the temp was set to 65 degrees. The checkout desk didn't even ask how are stay was or thank us for staying there just handed me the bill and that's it. The concierge and doormen were fantastic! Always holding the door and getting us a taxi as needed. For the most part I think there are far better hotels you can find in manhattan this is not one I would recommend.

<Content>Great Views, Nice Hotel too! We arrived on a Saturday for a weekend stay at the Millenium Hilton. They are doing construction on Church Street, so you are forced to enter through the side entrance on Fulton Street. This particular trip we drove into NYC, and it was POURING rain. I couldn't have asked for a more helpful staff as we arrived. We had our two small children with us, so the bellman immediately came to my car and started grabbing my bags. He was so fast, I had to slow him down, so he didn't bring all the contents of my car into the hotel. It was great service. He encouraged us to get the kids inside and had my car valet parked. I had my room keys within a few minutes and my bags were taken up to my room with us. The rooms were clean and comfortable, but not huge - typical of NYC. Flat screen tv was great for the kids, but reception wasn't that spectacular for some channels. The view from the 28th floor over former WTC site is unreal, even in the rain! The lobby was small, but nice. The gift shop was the size of a closet. Once four people get in there, it gets complicated. Most importantly, all staff members I encountered at this hotel were friendly. The concierge was very helpful in recommending nearby eateries that would suit our budget, and accomodate two small kids. He knew everything from local pizzerias and delis to 5 star restaurants. The subway was right across the street, and also a block away (depending on what line you were looking for) so we were able to access all of NYC very easily. The rates at this hotel tend to be pretty high whenver I check them, but because of its location, it tends to be much less expensive on the weekends. Give it a shot! My one negative of the visit was when I picked up my car from the valet. It's a Hilton garage right behind the hotel, but it's operated by a parking lot company. You have to call a number from your room to tell them you want your car, as it takes up to 1/2 hour for them to get your car. We were never told of that, until after the bellman came up to get our bags. We were told to wait in the lobby and ended up doing so for quite some time. Then our car was brought out and nobody told us it was ready. It was pretty confusing. Other than that minor mishap, I'd say this hotel was worth the price I paid.

<Content>Great Location/Amenities...Just In The Budget We usually stay at more independent hotels when we go to New York for two reasons; usually a lot more inexpensive and predictable on the amenities/service (once you've found a good one). This trip was somewhat last minute and we looked at all of our usual locales and came up with nothing. The Millennium Hilton looked appealing because it was basically the same price as less than stellar comparables and it was right by all of the subway lines we needed.Bottom line...we were blown away by the quality of the rooms, service, and location. It's basically a 4 star hotel in my opinion for NYC. Across the street from the WTC site its within blocks of almost all subway lines (W,Q,N,E,C,B,etc.). Would definitely stay there again if we could get the same deal (around $200), but have a feeling that its cheap only because of all of the construction going on in the area.

<Content>OK, if you get a good price First, this Hilton has much more personality than most Hiltons. That is good. My room had large windows, and being high up, I had a spectacular view of the Brooklyn Bridge. Whatever they may get wrong here, you still have the view. Speaking of wrong, the room service was a horrible experience. The delivery time was twice what they quoted on the phone, and the food was just bad. The downstairs staff was friendly and courteous, better than other Hiltons. A subway location is almost right outside the door, so you can get updown very easily. Unfortunately, I didn't get such the deal other reviewers did. So for a price in the upper $200's, I would probably look elsewhere next time. If I could get it for about $200, I would book it.

<Content>Very nice hotel We travel frequently to NYC, and stay at Hilton hotels, as I am a frequent business traveler and all of my stays have been reward stays.The Millenium was the fourth hotel in NYC that we tried. It was very clean, and indeed had plasma screen tv's as advertised. Twice we have stayed in the Time Square area, and it was very noisy in the room (New York Hilton). The traffic down in lower Manhattan is inconsequential and subsequently, we slept great. The bed is very comfortable, and the bathroom is average size. Overall, a nice hotel. The lobby isn't fancy, which I don't have a problem with, since at this hotel they used the money they saved and put it in the hotel rooms.If you're concerned about staying in a location that's not central, not too worry. The subway is right across the street, and cabs are readily available all hours of the day. A cab ride to the Rockerfeller Center area will run you about $10, a Lincoln Town Car about $25 - $30.I would definately stay at this hotel again.

<Content>WONDERFUL We stayed at the Millienium last year in May for a weekend and loved it. The hotel does have a depressing view on one side (WTC site) but other than that there is nothing wrong with it. Even though outside our window was the site we still had a great view looking up and all the way to the river. The staff downstairs were great and cordial. The room was wonderful. Not large but considering NYC it was nothing to complain about. If you have a lot of bags than you might run into some issues but other than that there is no reason to be unhappy. Room and bathroom were clean, bed and sheets soft and comfy, and the flat screen hanging on the wall was also nice. The breakfast we got one morning with room service was not first rate but still satisfying with a generous stock of maple syrop, jam and honey. I really recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys a nice place to come back to after a long day out on the town.

<Content>The secret's out, this is the place to stay in NYC! My husband had stayed here many times for business so he suggested it for a recent weekend trip with family and it turned out to be a good deal (from Hilton web site, we paid under $200 a night which isn't bad in NYC) and a nice place to stay. Note: if you want to hang out and wave at the TV cameras in Times Square, that is not even within walking distance. Not near Broadway, either. This hotel is in the financial district, right across from where the World Trade Center towers once stood. Convenient to subway. Lots of cabs around.The room was small and modern and very clean but the view was awesome -- we were on a corner so we could look out at Ground Zero and the new building underway plus see out to the water and across to Brooklyn. Battery Park is within walking distance (wonderful views, can go to Ellis Island and Statute of Liberty from here. The tulips were blooming and we people watched the joggers and doggies and such). Also close are SoHo, TriBecca and Chinatown. Century 21 is next door to the hotel and JR Music World is nearby. Fewer tourists and what a relief to be away from the zoo that is Times Square but the hotel was full when we stayed so don't expect to have the place for yourself on a weekend (bummer!) The Crabtree and Evelyn bath products are nice. Breakfast buffet had 2 kinds of eggs, suasage, bacon, fresh fruit, cereals, granola, French toast, wonderful pastries and bagels and more that I am simply not remembering. It was free due to H's Diamond status but they charge $20 ordinarily. Fear not: there are several Starbucks nearby as well as many other options. Front desk and housekeeping staffs were courteous and efficient. We'd booked online and everything was smooth -- we needed 2 rooms, one a handicapped accessible and that was not a problem. Though we booked separately, we made a note online and they did put rooms together. Only negative: the dining room staff are very uneven. They can be awful (i.e. neglectful about refills and even snotty of attitude. Sometimes you will stand and wait for a table for several minutes though half the restaurant is empty and many staff are milling around). Then the next morning, they will be prompt, courteous and great. They have some weird hierarchy they try to impose on the window seats -- don't let them. If youwant to sit by a window and there is one open, tell them when they seat you and don't take any silliness. They are also sloppy about the bill so check the check!! Overall, a great stay. We will be back.

<Content>This Suite was Sweet With play tickets for an evening show purchased,I looked on the different travel sites for something reasonable in LOWER MANHATTAN/SOHO. We like to walk around and experience the art of the city.(the subway is a $2.00, ten minute ride to Times Square) Frustrated by the non bargain-like prices, I went directly to the Hilton website, only to find a junior suite for $239.00.This was a deal! Check-in was speedy, our room on the 44th floor, gave us a majestic view of 911, and we were centrally located to do SOHO,TRIBECCA,and CANAL STREET, all in one afternoon. SPAMALOT was a big hit and so was this HILTON.

<Content>Millenium Hilton , Nice hotel, Check in was awful We arrived at the Millenium Hilton at 1:30pm last Saturday, to check in. (We had requested an early check in.) They said the room was not ready but they would call me on my cell. I called back at 3pm, and was told my room was still not ready. We arrived back at the hotel at 4pm and again was told that our room was not ready. I told the man at the check in desk, we had dinner reservations and needed to shower and get ready. He was not helpful, and said they allow late checkouts to their guest. Why would the hotel allow late check outs when a guest has requested an early check in? He said he could not help us. They should review this late check out policy. The lobby was very hectic and there were other guests who also were told their rooms were not ready. I was only in New York for 1 night with my children and paid a good amount for the room. The service should have been better. I will say the hotel rooms are quite nice with beautiful views. However I do not think I would go back, since they check in was so bad.

<Content>New Year in New York We stayed at the Millenium Hilton over New Year, we found the room to be clean and well presented. Bathroom and room were both spacious. We found all the staff we encountered to be helpful and friendly. The bed was very comfortable although the air conditioning was quite noisy.Our only criticism is that room service trays and dirty plates were left on corridors for days before being removed.We have stayed in New York a number of times and would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good Value Last weekend I spent 2 nights at this hotel with a few friends from out of town for St Patricks Day weekend. The stay started out a little rocky since we were told that our car would be parked off site and we would not have access to it for the duration of our visit. I am guessing this is not uncommon in NYC, but still inconvienent. Then, when we checked in we were told at registration that the room had only one bed! This was unacceptable since there were 4 of us and my reservation had specifically stated that I had reserved a room with 2 beds. After assuring us that there were no rooms with two beds in the entire hotel (suites included) for nearly 10 minutes, they magically found one on the 42nd floor. I have to say they were pleasant during this entire process but it took some major patience and negotiating to resolve. Once these initial snafus were past us, the rest of the weekend was a blast! The room was immaculate and well stocked with towels and glasses and provided an impressive view uptown and of the Hudson. The cleaning staff did a excellent job and the concierge and bellman were all eager to help us enjoy our stay.The hotel location is in the Financial District so it tended to get a little quiet at night (it's no Times Square). However, there is a nice subway station at Ground Zero right in front of the hotel and taxi service from the side door (the actual front entrance was under construction while we were there). We found it easy to get anywhere from this hotel by using either the train ($2/per person) or getting a cab (usually less than $10). The only real gripe I have with the stay is that the room got really hot after the first night and there was no effective way to cool it down. Only one small section of our window would open and even then it only moved about 2 inches. It was 34 degrees out but our room constantly hovered around 80 degrees with the A/C on. The front desk said that their HVAC system was based on hot water so when it is heating season, there is no A/C and vice versa. This seems pretty archaic to me so, to future winter travelers I would recommend keeping a window open since you can always heat up the room if necessary.Overall the stay was good and we had a wonderful experience. I would definitely stay here again.PS Our beautiful 42 plasma TV was hobbled by a poor cable feed that created a crappy picture.

<Content>Great Location It couldn't have been easier to find, straight accross the road from the station. We were a bit concerned that we would be too far away from the rest of New York but if you plan your days well, you can go to the top end (Central park) inc Time square etc one day, Little Italy, China Town etc another and then Statue of Liberty and Financial district another. The underground is easy to use once you learn what lines and stops are needed and walking part of the way is just delightful as you feel so involved in the wonderful city. The staff in the hotel were a bit business like and matter of fact but it was imaculate and with views over ground zero it was just fantastic and really made you think about what had happened on that dreadful day. We had a look at a hotel in the Time square area that we had tried to book and we would stay in that one another time.

<Content>Great Hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel From Nov 23- Dec 01 ,2005. We loved it. We booked it at a great rate which included buffet breakfast every day. It was our first time in New York and we were a little nervous. We found the Hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The subway station right across the street (ground zero) was our ticket to seeing all the sights of New York. It was awesome having the subway station so close. The best part of this hotel was being right next to Century 21 ( that is if you are a shopper). It gave me a chance to check out all the great deals every day. I would head their every morning at 7:45 when it opens (my husband would still be in bed ) and check out all the new inventory and great deals ! I totally recommend this Hotel to anyone. The location is a little ways away from the business of time square but with the subway so conviently located it takes you know time to see all that new York has to offer. The rooms were spacious, clean and very nice. We loved the Plasma T.V

<Content>Very Impressed Check in and check out was a breeze. The bellman who helped us to the front desk was superb. He was very helpful and very attentive. The room was very clean, very comfortable and cozy. Room service was very fast. The prices are a little expensive, but in comparison to other hotels we've stayed at, the prices would be considered reasonable. My only gripe about this hotel is that parking is $48/night w/o in/out privileges. But overall, the experience was excellent. The next time I visit NY, I will definitely stay here.

<Content>Great Hotel --would stay here again Great hotel! The service was great, this was the first time we have stayed in lower Manhattan, usually stay in Times Square. This hotel was less expensive and it was quieter here than Times Square.The subway station is right across the street so easy access to get anywhere all over the city.Ditto on the comments of the bed -- very restful nights.The Stage Door Deli --right across the street is a must for breakfast -- for 10 bucks total, my husband and I had all we wanted to eat -- bagels, omelettes, etc. Great food!

<Content>Quality hotel with hidden supprises Just got back after a long weekend in the Big Apple with my wife.We decided on the Millennium Hilton because of the good price that was on offer when we booked through Expedia, plus I didn't fancy staying in a midtown hotel.Overall I have to say that the service at this hotel was some of the best I have had at a 4*+ hotel. The staff would answer the phone after on ring and there was always someone to hand on the main desk.The rooms were large by New York standards, we had a King deluxe suite, and were well appointed with high speed internet access, plenty of stationary, Crabtree  Evelyn bath products, digital climate control, three setting power shower and the infamous 42 plasma screen. The standard king size The Bed is one of the most comfortable beds I have stayed in and was well received after all the walking we did.As for the view, we were on the 21st floor and we had a fabulous view of the Hudson River. As for the view of Ground Zero, whilst it is sobering the first time you see it from up high you quickly realise that New York and its residents have moved on and won't let it get the better of them and soon you feel the same way.I read in a previous review about the Stage Door Deli located on Vesey Street. This place serves up some of the best Hero's in New York at very reasonable prices. The breakfast is bigger, nicer and 1/3 of the price in the hotel.The swimming pool and sauna is a nice addition and like the bed is very welcome after a long day out.Century 21 located next door is a must. I picked up a pair of Hugo Boss jeans for $90 reduced from $180. There are bargains all over the store and the place is busy all day with long queues for the changing rooms.Now for the hidden surprise.Hilton charges a fee of $75 per night to cover incidentals. This is deducted from your credit card when you check in. If, like myself, you rely on you credit card it can come as a surprise when your card is rejected. As with European hotels your credit card details are taken when you check in but instead of assessing any costs and deducting them from your card when you check out, they deduct $75 per night there and then. They do not tell you that they will deduct it straight away nor is it explained in any of their literature. I was told that it did explain on the Hilton website but as I did not book through their website I did not read this. I tried to get the money back after the embarrassment of having my card refused only to be told that because it was the weekend they couldn't do anything until the Monday. Now as this was on a Saturday it left us with little money and forced us to eat and drink at the hotel. So make sure you have this covered. Also beware of what the bellboys call a taxi. Out side the hotel will be rows of black cars/limos. Whilst they are licensed by the TLC they operate a fixed rate and not metered. We took one of these cars from the hotel to the Empire State building and it cost us $24 (without tip) where as the taxi back cost $15 (including tip). However, these cars come in handy going back to JFK because the fixed rate is $50 regardless of how long it takes to get there whereas a taxi is on a meter and it took us nearly an hour to get to the airport at 2pm.

<Content>Superb with humble views of ground zero Stayed here from feb 3rd to feb 6th and had an excellent stay. Rooms were a good size (twice as big as The Time hotel) and had a huge very comfortable bed. The room service was prompt and we found the food of a good standard. The maids were very good and kept our room very tidy with fresh towels every day. The views of ground zero are very humbling and cannot be avoided. All in all an excellent time and we wouldnt fail to recommend this hotel to anyone, the only complaint is its a fair distance from time square although right next to a tube entrance and taxis are fairly easy to hail.

<Content>Poorly managed Worst issue: after cleaning my room the housekeeper left the door completley open. Granted I had left most important things in the safe deposity box, all my PC realted stuff was out. Also, I didn't know if there was anyone lurking in the room. Pretty scary stuff. Second, food is terrible.Third, breakfast room service tray was left in the hallway all day long, wasn't picked up until after 7pm. There were trays all over the hallway. What a messy and unsanitary look. Get it together , and have someone walk the halls every few hours to pick up trays. I won't be returning.

<Content>Fantastic trip! My husband and I took my parents to the Millenium Hilton for a long weekend. At first we were nervous after reading the other reviews; however, the hotel was wonderful! The location was excellent. You were a 15-20 minute walk to Soho and Little Italy. The Statue of Liberty was close by too. The hotel bar (in the lobby) was expensive, but there are plenty of watering holes to visit. The train was literally across the street from the WTC complex. As for the location being depressing...If you plan on staying at a hotel across the street from the worst terrorist attack of our generation then you should expect to be moved. It made you stop and reflect; however, it was hardly depressing.The rooms were clean, clean and clean. I am used to staying at the Ritz Carlton Battery Park. These rooms are smaller, but for the value, the location and quality of the hotel far exceeds the Ritz.The only complaint was obtaining the car from the parking garage. I recommend calling one hour prior to pick-up (especially if checking out at noon), there was a delay in getting the car.Do not hesitate to stay here.

<Content>Love the Millenium Hilton My daughter two grand daughters 12 and 7 years and myself arrived at this lovely hotel on 26th December. The lobby had a beautiful Christmas Tree and the trees outside the hotel were smothered with fairly lights. Our Junior suite on the 54th floor overlooking Ground Zero and also with a view of the Statue of Liberty was excellent, spotlessly clean, the bathroom luxurious, plenty of soft fluffy towels and toiletries. The staff we encountered from every department, even security, when one child locked the other one out of the room and would not let her in and she was crying out in the corridoor, were couteous and helpful. The the nicest surprize was on our last evening after a very busy day and returning to our room late evening we decided to have room service for dinner. It was fantastic, the food was excellent, served from a trolly that turned into a table for four, beautiful china, cutlery and linen a carnation in a small bud vase and a most attentive waiter and no more expensive that the restaurants we went to on previous days. All those things and in such an accessable position, a few steps from the subway and so much quieter than in the heart of the city. I highly reconmend this hotel.

<Content>Beautiful hotel but some service issues Stayed at the Hilton Millenium for three nights Jan. 3-6 2006. Stayed on the 54th floor in a king parlor corner suite. I doubt there could be better views from any room in any hotel in NYC. Hudson River to the west, with magnificent sunsets. East River to the east with beautiful views of Brooklyn Bridge. Out the center windows Ground Zero and beyond. The views at night were the most beautiful with buildings and bridges sparkling in all three directions. The room was wonderful. Seperate bedroom with master bath including seperate shower and tub. Large living area with couches, chairs, and dining table. Our daughters slept on pull out sofa and had their own bath. Could not have asked for a nicer suite for our family.Service issues-room not ready when we arrived so desk clerk told us baggage handlers would store baggage. Much appreciated. Asked concierge who to arrange this with and they continued their joking and laughing and pointed toward bellmen. Asked a bellman and he pointed to another bellman. That bellman held up his hand to me to stop my request mid-sentence, informed me he was helping somebody else. Poor customer service. Room service was slow, expensive, and the food was poor. Twice attempted to get something from gift shop and both times found sign on the door be right back. If not for these issues, could be a five star hotel.Saw two shows, Wicked and The Producers. Both were great. Exhibit at South St. Sea Port called Bodies amazing and should not be missed. Human cadavers donated to science have been treated,preserved, and displayed to allow people to see bones,muscles,organs,pathological conditions such as a brain that has suffered a stroke, smokers vs. non-smokers lung etc. This was done with taste and dignity. A great educational experience. The Stage Deli, as always has the best deli food and enormous, well worth the calories desserts. The Stage Door Deli across from the Millenium Hilton is not related, not really that good, and there was a mouse running around between tables when we were there. Would have been nice to have in room coffee but Starbucks and bagels just around the corner. China town great fun and great food. Great city, great trip, and great hotel suite. Would stay again despite service issues because suite and views so nice.

<Content>It does exactly what it says on the label No doubting its a very good hotel. But...it IS a Hilton and had we not had the view over Ground Zero we could have been in a Hilton Hotel in any number of large cities.At least you know what you are getting.Special mention has to go to Joe one of the concierge, and Steve one of the Doormen. Excellent service above and beyond. Joe managed to get us booked into a New Years Eve Dinner Dance at a restaurent within 5 mins walk of the hotel at less that 24hr notice and it was fantastic value at $150 for two inc 4 courses + live music + an open bar 9-12pm. Steve managed to get us an immaculate stretched limo for our trip to see Fiddler on the Roof at just $35 door to door!! Thanks guys.The extortionate prices of the hotels breakfast ($22pp) can easily be avoided.There ARE a number of good restaurants and deli/diners for that authentic NYC breakfast or brunch in the Financial District.The Stage Door Deli / Essex Cafe and Paninis are all within a few hundred metres and offer great value for money and are recommended both for food quality and that edgy NYC atmosphere.For dinner we would heartily recommend Giovanni's Atrium ( Italian ) and Les Halles ( French ) both exellent and again within easy walking distance. O'Haras Bar/Restaurant next to the Fire Station adjacent to Ground Zero is 'ok' but couldn't be recommended, pretty basic food and service, and not that cheap. Worth seeing/doing while you are there?USS Intrepid,Circle Line Boat Trip,Central Park etc. At the Empire State Building, avoid the queues and buy the virtual flight tickets off the guys in the yellow jackets who will offer you tickets while you are in the queue for the Empire. Sure its a few extra dollars but it will save you anything up to a 3 to 4hr wait. Another alert! We bought a City Pass book for a number of attractions prior to going. It states in the City Pass that it allows you to beat the queues and go straight to the front of the line....it doesn't work, you will be directed to joint the queue at the back just like everyone else.National History Museum adjacent to Central Park.It's good BUT probably needs at least two days to do it justice. Cabs were an total lottery. We had the full spectrum from a genuine new yorker type ( a la De Niro )who was great. The other end of the scale was an atrocious driver of far eastern origin who it seemed had little or no idea of geography or driving skills and even decided to stop for petrol and take a leak while the meter was left running and added about $3 to the bill...bizarre.For real night time entertainment either head for Chinatown ( Winnies is fun, although not for the faint hearted ). Swing46 a really cool Jazz Bar/Restaurant on 46th Street offers a great value fixed price 3 course meal for $22 before 7.30pm, ideal for pre theatre eats. Just along the street from there is a great piano/singalong bar where you will be entertained by Broadway singers for the price of your beers. The Oyster Bar on the lower level at Grand Central Station should not be missed.New York really is spectacular.  Overall a great 50th Birthday trip. I just need a holday to get over it now!!!!!

<Content>GREAT HOTEL WITH FANTASTIC VIEWS I stayed at this hotel with my husband and two children (aged 9  13) over Xmas and New Year. We had a corner room on the 45th floor with large windows overlooking Ground Zero and The Statue of Liberty on one side and Brooklyn  Manhattan Bridge on the other side. The room was large enough for the four of us and bigger than most I have stayed in across Europe. The only thing we would have liked in the room is tea  coffee making facilities, but they did provide bottled water in the room every day at no cost. The indoor pool was a real bonus for us as the children enjoyed a swim after a long days sightseeing. All the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Getting to Midtown was very easy, a taxi outside the hotel cost between $10- $15. The Subway was another option and cost $2 each or you could buy a pass making it cheaper per trip. You can get a really good breakfast at The Stage Door Deli across the road. On a previous trip I stayed in Times Square at The Marriott Marquis, which was equally as nice but did not have a pool. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a good quality hotel with a pool who doesn't mind getting a taxi or Subway into Midtown (takes about 20 mins).We went to Central Park on New Years Eve and saw some amazing fireworks and a midnight run.

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed at the Millenium Hilton on December 3. The prices were high throughout New York since it was prime shopping season. We chose to stay here as it seemed like the nicest hotel for the money. I booked through the Hilton website about 1 month prior to our visit. In the final week the price dropped $200. I called the hotel to ask for an adjustment and they accomdated me quite politely. Be sure to watch the prices as your date gets closer!The hotel overall was nice. The room was on the small side, but from what I hear this is typical. It was very clean and comfortable. Our room was over looking Ground Zero. As my husband put it, if you could throw a rock out the window you would hit it. It was a distance from Midtown but the cabs were always available.Overall we enjoyed our stay here and would consider it again.

<Content>Very enjoyable - just a couple of minus points My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights late December. Our room was very pleasant and comfortable. It was great to be so close to the subway until the strike!! However we were able to use the PATH train to get to 33rd street. Staff were OK but didn't help at all in terms of how to get to JFK during a transit strike - we got good advice from fellow travellers on the trains that were running. No tea or coffe facilities in room and very expensive restaurant/bar. Would recommend the Italian restaurant ECCO which is about 15 minutes walk away and also the Salaam (not sure of spelling) Bombay - both excellent and not too expensive. The church next door is well worth a visit as it has moving displays re. 9/11 - you could walk past it and not know!

<Content>Good Lower Manhattan Hotel I've booked this hotel through Hotwire and paid 177$ a night. During Christmas time in New York, this is cheap rate. For the price, the Millenium Hilton was beyond our expectations. Great view on Ground Zero, large room(in New York standards), exceptionnally confortable bed. But if I would have paid the rack rate of 400$ US, I don't think my review would have been the same. Don't forget that this hotel is in the Lower part of Manhattan, 10-15 minutes away from Times Square by subway. The financial district is also very deserted on week-ends and at night.

<Content>Only if you have to.... The Millenium Hilton is an ok hotel in an ok location but there are many better options in New York. the rooms are tired and the bathrooms need updating. The facilities in the room are sparse without even a trouser press or even bathrobes unless you ask! the rooms are quite noisy on every floor. The staff are friendly-ish. The restaurant has a very limited choice. Overall the hotel is fine if you need to stay downtown or have a corporate arrangement but if you are a tourist in New York, its only key advantage is proximity to Ground Zero and Century21 (the discount department store).

<Content>Highly recommend Just got back from a 3 day trip to Manhattan and stayed at the Millenium Hilton. It was fantastic. Very clean, excellent amenities, and the staff was courteous and helpful. And it's right next to Ground Zero. The only downside...expensive!! But everything in Manhattan is expensive. If I have to pay around $400 for a hotel room in New York, I might as well stay at a four star luxury such as the Millenium, which by the way, has a 42 inch flatscreen in every room. I recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a reliable place for a trip to Manhattan.

<Content>Didn't care for it I just joined this great site and felt I owed a post.First of all, I found the location depressing. This hotel is like a NYC sliver building, and every window overlooks what is essentially a mass grave. Its a bizarre, alienating experience to walk around in your skivvies as your room seems to positively overhang this great, grey chasm.Speaking of windows, seemed to me the building was redone rather shabbily after 9/11, and the curtain wall exterior is too thin and lets in too much noise. I had to change rooms because one of the enormous windows was flexing and popping in the wind.Lastly, don't pay extra for a suite unless you really need a separate office. From what I can see, a suite gets you pretty much the same floor space as a standard room, only chopped into two too-small roomlets by placing the bathroom between. If you do stay, the standard room is nicer.

<Content>Loved it! My husband whisked me away to New York City for my Christmas present, needless to say I was blown away by the city and the hotel. The view from our room was great, the floor to ceiling windows and flat screen TV were nice touches and the bed was possibly the most comfortable either of us have slept in. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the lift was super quick! Would recommend this hotel.

<Content>ok, not great My family of 6 spent 2 nights (thanksgiving) at this Hilton. The lobby is very small by HIlton standards. Check in was smooth. Got to the room to find that the double beds were smaller than standard size. So we called to the front desk to order roll aways. No problem, $25 per bed per room. Yikes! Our sons room mini fridge was full of old and smelly food. Housekeeping came up quickly to remove. Later that evening I called for more washcloths as there was only 1 in our room. An hour later they were delivered. Plasma screen tvs don't impress me like they seem to impress so many other guests. tv is tv. We go to NYC to see the sights not watch things we can watch at home. Exercise facilities and pool are very nice. Having to pay for internet service is ridiculous! I find it funny that Hampton Inn's don't charge for internet service and yet the more upscale Hilton properties try to grab more money from you for something that should easily be included in your hotel quote.Location of this Hilton is only a minor inconvenience. Subway is just across the street and taxis are plentiful. Valet parking only at $45 per night. No in and out parking available. Takes about 25 mintues to get your car.Had desert in the hotel restaurant. Very good and staff was very friendly. Breakfast was suppose to be included but my husband had to go to the front desk to have the charges removed.Being across the street from the World Trade Center site was humbling and my family spent some time just looking out our windows at the site as well as walking around the area.No real perks at this Hilton for belonging to Hilton Honors. Would I choose this Hilton again, probably not. I wouldn't mind the distance to main sights if the hotel itself was more appealing. We have stayed in many hotels in NYC that had more ambience. However, if you get a good rate and it's price you are interested in than you'll probably be okay here.

<Content>A fine place to kip! My partner her daughter and myself stayed for 6 nights from 19th November. A great place with good staff, however some of the bellhops do try and get you to ride in unlicensed cabs. We had a great stay, with only one real problem - they put us into a room with only two single beds - we had paid and requested a King/Queen plus a single for our little girl. After 30 minutes of phone calls they put us into a suite.Apart from that, a great place in a great location, allthough it does get quiet during the evening, but the subway is across the street, and in 10 minutes you are in midtown.

<Content>ooohhh... that plasma... Myself and my girlfriend travelled to NY for a 4 day break (Nov 19th to 23rd).We arrived in NY fairly late on the saturday night (arrived at the hotel at around 9pm).check in was very good. asked for not too high a room as i suffer from vertigo. was offered a room on the 9th floor but braved the 17th floor!the room was pretty nice. the bed was extremely comforatble and the bathroom was a good size with a powerful shower. Plasma TV was superb!one negative was even from the 17th floor there was a lot of noise from the work going on at ground zero and some roadworks by the side of the hotel. earplugs soon sorted that out though.after we'd thrown down our bags we decided to walk and find a bar to grab a couple of beers and a snack. that was the hard part. walked to 2 TGI friday's - they were noth closed! after about 30 minutes we found an irish bar that although lacking in food, made up for it on the beer front! we ended up picking up some food from a deli and taking it back to the hotel.the next 3 days were largely spent out of the hotel. the area of the hotel is a ghost town after 8pm, but it's a short subway trip to the livelier areas.i paid about 拢125 a night for my room. cheap by NY standards due no doubt to the thanksgiving holidays. no business people = lower than normal prices i guess. the week prior, and after our trip the prices were around double this! 拢125 - superb value.... 拢250? i'd want somewhere closer to the action.

<Content>Not so far out of the way. The lobby of the hotel is small and not architecturally appealing, but the lobby staff is courteouse and effective at checking guest in. We were able to check in by 11:00am and had a room on the 47th floor overlooking the WTC site and the Hudson river. The rooms are small but comfortable. I did notice that you can hear people in the halls and surrounding rooms. The 3rd floor bar is ok, but found the cocktails at the lobby bar to be served with more enthusiasm. Even though the hotel is in the finacial district downtown, you can still reach any midtown or uptown destination easily via the subways. The E train is just outside the door and the 2,3 a block up at Chambers street. The hotel was above average during our stay (11-18 to 11-21), however; we prefer the Ritz Carlton at Battery Park.

<Content>Great view- pleasant stay I stayed here for Christmas with my fiancee. The view from the 40th floor is beautiful. The bed was really comfy but for the price the room was rather small.- But you are paying for the hotel name and the plasma TV in the room.

<Content>Fantastic views - excellent service Have never written a review like this before, but following the most excellent 3 night stay at the Millenium Hilton felt compelled to recommend it to all. Having stayed in several pricey, but generally lousy, New York hotels this place was a cut above. Comfortable, spacious rooms with amazing views and friendly and exceedingly helpful staff, in a great location.

<Content>Great Stay At The Millenium I stayed here 2 nights with my wife and could not have had a better time we stayed on the 33rd floor. We had a view right out at ground zero which I did not see since 9-11 so it was a learning experience as far as accesing the damage. The room service was great and the mini bar is a tease but for those prices I could not touch it. So I advise anyone who stays to not look in there because it 's gonna get you. I would recommend this to all peole for all different reasons.

<Content>Superb Hotel A group of 6 of us stayed here for 3 nights and we had a fabulous time. We were on the 31st floor with rooms next to one another. We arrived at 1pm but our room wasn't ready, this wasn't a problem the hotel stored our luggage and we went out for a wander. We came across a TGI Fridays and had some nibbles and cocktails. When we returned to the hotel our rooms were ready. The rooms were perfect very clean and a great size with magnificant views of the hudson river and of course the rather humbling view of ground zero. We spent the evening in one of the rooms getting room service and drinks and just looking out the window at the awesome sight that is new york. Room service was excellant. The staff are very helpful and friendly. We found battery park was in walking distance and from here you can get tickets for the open top bus tours which can drop you at all the places you want to go. The Essex World Cafe is great for breakfast cross the road at the front of the hotel turn left along the front of the fence at ground zero. Turn right at the end of the fence and the Cafe is across the road, they do fabulous pancakes!!!

<Content>Great Hotel My husband and I stayed for 4 nights and would definately stay there again. We had a high floor room with a view of ground zero and the hudson river. The room was of average size, clean and comfortable, the 42 TV is a good addition, although we would have liked bath robes too.The staff were both friendly and helpful and the room service was good. We have never stayed downtown before but when the subway tickets are so cheap and there are plenty of things to do and see close by, we would recommend it.

<Content>thin walls you can hear the people next door I stayed for 4 nights and paid over $1,300.00. Three of the nights neighbors was partying till 3 am. These walls are paper thin. We could hear everything and I mean everything. I complain to the manager, but they just said they were sorry and did little to calm the situation. We couldn't sleep at night and had to sleep in the morning to catch up. I will never sleep at this place again and will tell everyone our horrible experience.

<Content>Millenium Hilton - a great option After struggling to find a hotel room under $250, I finally used priceline and got the Millenium Hilton for $200/night. I would definitely recommend this hotel. From what I understand the majority of the rooms have king-sized beds and views of ground zero, which also means views of the Hudson river. My husband and I didn't come here to see ground zero but rather to visit with friends but this hotel is perfectly located for those doing the touristy thing. It's close to the subway (1,9, A, C, E) and directly across the street from the PATH train. The area has everything you would need - coffee shops, shopping, etc. I expected downtown to be desolate but it isn't. The hotel is very clean and the rooms have recently been renovated. Although the rooms are probably typical NYC size (small) they are so well-designed that you hardly realize it. Our room had a plasma tv, a sleek desk with internet access, a sitting chair, a king sized bed and huge windows looking out over NY. The bathroom was huge and had big towels and crabtree  evelyn products. The only bummer was that there was not a coffee maker in our room so we had to schlep downstairs to get some. We also made the mistake of eating breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning. Although it was good, it cost us $20/person. Pretty hefty when we could have crossed the street and gotten the same thing for half the price. Overall, I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC.

<Content>Oh my god!  My favorite Hotel in New York City - and I have stayed at quite a few. From the moment you walk thru the beautiful revolving doors - you just know. Due to a celebration - they were so kind to give us the 54th floor with a breathtaking view. I am very particular when it comes to cleaniness and the room could not have been any cleaner. We had 2 beautiful bathrooms (separate ones was great - lol) Girls, lots of room to put all our stuff! Loved the flat screen T.V. in the wall - everything was just so perfect. The only thing to watch for is ordering room service - wow it could be real expensive - but we had so much fun doing it once - it was all worthed.You will love the Millenium - it just doesn't get better than this. The most comfortable beds. Deli's all over - shopping next door - go to Little Italy!ENJOY!

<Content>Great Choice We stayed in a standard king room for 4 nights in this recently renovated hotel. This hotel exceeded our expectations. We found a good rate on the Hilton website and prepaid, and there were no extra charge surprises on the bill at checkout. They placed us on the 12th floor. The room was extremely clean and comfortable. The bath was excellent. We enjoyed a wide view of the Hudson River. This hotel is in a perfect location for exploring the south end of Manhattan - look up the free shuttle buses operated by the Downtown Alliance to get around the south end. There are scads of places nearby to grab a reasonable breakfast sandwich or deli lunch. In July they did not have coffee pots in the room. Hotel was well-staffed and any help we needed was provided promptly and courteously. We prearranged our transportation to  from the airport with Carmel Limo service (full-size sedan) and will use them again.

<Content>A Really Nice Hotel! In our previous visits to New York City, we've always stayed in midtown Manhattan. However, when our usual hotel was booked solid, we decided to give the Millenium Hilton a try---and we were glad we did! We paid about $30/night extra for a room on the 31st-55th floor and got one on the 35th floor. The view is bittersweet---great city and Jersey views but sad at the same time since you are reminded of what used to be across the street.  The hotel is very clean and housekeeping is excellent--very consistent. Every night we were there, they had turn-down service. Not only did they turn down the bedcovers but they filled the ice bucket and left two bottles of water and two pieces of chocolate. As others pointed out, the toiletries are nice---Crabtree and Evelyn. The flat-screen plasma TV is nice, too. The only problem with that is the way it's positioned, you need to sit on the bed to see it or position the desk chair so that it faces the TV. We found the bed to be very comfortable and even though we were near the elevator and ice machine, we never had a problem with noise. The closet is small but it met our needs just fine. Elevator service is great--prompt and fast--we never had a problem with that. At this hotel, you are very close to several subway lines so getting around the city is quite easy.  We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant since there are so many other options available in NYC. Plus, you can get a much cheaper breakfast elsewhere. In short, we would gladly stay here again! While we would have preferred a room on the other side of the hotel, we discovered that only the suites and junior suites face in the other direction---so it would have been more expensive.

<Content>Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed In!!! I stayed at this hotel from September 2nd - September 5th, for Labor Day Weekend. I reserved months in advance, so i was able to book for $199 per night. For the three nights it came up to about $690, which was well worth the stay. For an easy way to get here from Newark International, you can catch the #62 bus to Newark Penn Station which is $1.50. Then catch the Path Train to the World Trade Center Path Station. The cost of the ticket is also $1.50. As you come out of the train station the hotel is right across the street. How convenient is that. The view was amazing. I was in Room 1704. Having a city view, you're looking straight down into the World Trade Center. The area is close to alot of restaurants and its a short walk down to Battery Park for the statue of liberty. Another site not to miss is South Side Seaport which is just a few blocks away as well. You're situated right infront of Bradway, soo you;re close to many restaurants. TGI Fridays is right out the door. There;s also Century 21 right next door, which is a department store which sells discount name brand items.The two best things about his hotel is their restaurant and the plasma TV. The rooms are extremely clean and you'll feel like King and Queen. For anyone having dinner at Church and Dey Restaurant, the food is great. Their steak is the softest i've ever tasted. But my all-time favourite is the lemon chicken with mashed potatoes. Up til now i cant stop thinking about how great those mashed potatoes are.This hotel is the best that i've ever stayed in and the service is excellent. I will always stay here as long as i'm i New York.Warning: Don't touch anything in the mini bar. And i mean TOUCH! You'll be charged, and they're not exactly cheap!

<Content>A+ Hotel, A+ Location, A+ View, A+ Value Arrived via Amtrak from Phiadelphia at 1PM Sept. 9 for a 3 night stay.Despite being early check-in, they had a room on the 45th floor ready and awaiting my arrival. First, realize this hotel is downtown, near Wall St. and immediately across the street from Ground Zero. Built in the early 1990's, the hotel was damaged by the scumbags, closed for nearly 2 years, and completely re-vamped. I stayed in the regular 1King bed room. This is the most basic room at the hotel. For more $ you can get a junior suite, which offers some more room, and a view that looks more uptown rather than downtown. Some consider this a plus. For me, ground zero, the buildings around ground zero, the Hudson River with its traffic, and NJ and the sunsets made my view the best in the hotel. All rooms offer the large plasma TV, nice work table with convenient internet and electrical plugs, floor to ceiling windows and in-room safe. No in-room wireless internet (wireless in lobby/lounge/restaurant only). They charge $5.95 per 24 hours, or $9.95 if you must log on to your own internet provider. They will give you the T1 cord for a $10 deposit.Rooms very comfortable. Bed nice and well appointed with sheets and comforter. Closet small-enough room for 1 person but would be stretching it for 2 people. The dresser is dominated by mini-bar, mini-refer which doesn't leave a lot of drawer space. Bathrooms very nice w/marble and a good shower up high so someone 6'2 or so doesn't have to bend over to wash hair. Towels and bathroom amenities servicable. Note only one sink-may be 2 in the junior suite - if that's an issue, check.Not only is the room comfortable and new, the view is stunning. I was there for the 911 aniversary/memorial. To look out and see the crowds and the firetrucks and police cars and mourners and everyone else paying their respects was staggering. To be able to walk out the door and across the street and be Right There was amazing. A lot of people suggest staying up towards ( or in) Times Square so you can really be a part of the party. I disagree and am more than happy I stayed at the M. Hilton. 15 minute walk to L.Italy/Chinatown. 15 to Wall St. 15 to ferry boats to NJ. Anything further, there is a subway stop a block away, or just catch a cab. It is quieter and less congested down here than up at Times Sq. It is convenient to go up in the evening, see Times, see the lights and masses of people and hawkers, and for me; cool to leave it behind and come back to the hotel. Also, restaurant and room service both very good - if you do get room service, realize you are paying $4 plus 15% on top of the price of food. This is the tip. Don't leave more money after you are already forced to tip (unless you are just really generous - if so, give me a call). I had no time for pool and no need for work-out after all the hiking I did each day, so I can not comment on either of those facilities. My minor complaint: while room was clean, there were a couple strands of hair in tub. I seem to see this almost everywhere I stay, yet I don't like it and find it disquieting - once I see that I question the cleanliness of the rest of the room and am on the lookout for something else to complain about. Other very minor incident - on 9/11 I removed DND sign from door and went to GZ. Returned 2 hrs. later and room not yet cleaned. Called housekeeping then took computer down to lounge, had a drink, sent a couple emails, returned 50 minutes later, and room was completed. No big deal.I will certainly stay at the Millenium Hilton again. In fact, I am already planning my next trip in 2006 to NYC, and have no cause to stay anywhere else. Last advice, if you do stay at a Hilton property, become a member of their frequent guest club. 500 miles per stay or a couple other options. If you like to fly first class you can't beat incentive bonuses.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, and Great staff Booked a room on hotwire for $202 (174 + tax) a few days before our Friday night visit. We called a day earlier to ask if we could check in at noon and receptionist was frosty, said she couldn't guarantee anything. Arrival was easy; there's an ACE and 123 stop (Chambers St) just steps from the hotel. We arrived at noon and the front desk clerk was gracious and accomodating and found us a room on the 41st floor facing the world trade center site and the river. Great views. Decor was generic but the bed was comfortable and linens pristine. Bathroom was decently sized, had a nice tub, Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, and a shaving mirror. This was definitely a nice business-type hotel. Location was perfect for us because we prefer downtown and it was nice to be close to Brooklyn where our friends live. Cons included lack of decent food (except a deli) around the corner. Plus, this part of the city is quieter and you can get anywhere in minutes using the subway. Front desk was exceptionally friendly and helpful - they are what makes this place stand out.

<Content>Millenium Hilton - You Can't Go Wrong Here !! I read all the reviews with skepticism. I've been disappointed before with New York hotels. This time, however, I was not. From the moment you walk off the sidewalk, you realize this hotel is upscale. The location is incredible: right across the street from the World Trade Center plaza and in walking distance to many attractions. There are also several wonderful restaurants within a few blocks. Be sure to check out St. Paul's Chapel right next door. It was built in 1766 and has a cemetary on the grounds with stones dating back to the 1700's. George Washington has a special pew in the church. This was a resting spot for the volunteers in the 9/11 tragedy and there is a lot of memorabilia and photos on display. A must-see. But get there early - as I recall visiting hours end around 3 p.m.As for the hotel, the rooms are not large, but they are very comfortable and extremely clean. The beds are superb with down comforters, and each room has a large flat panel television. The hotel is well constructed and the rooms are quiet. The only noise you will hear is the plumbing, but I doubt there is anything that could be done about that. As you might expect, the food here is expensive. I only had the breakfast buffet (once), but it set me back around $20. Pricey by anyone's standards.The views are incredible. I stayed on the 23rd floor and had a perfect view straight down into ground zero. It really made me reflect on the heroism shown and the lives lost in that tragedy. The service at this hotel is also superb. I felt like the staff went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. From the front desk to the bellmen, they were all just top-notch.I paid $389 per night, which would be exorbitant in any other city in the country, but I felt like I got my money's worth here. I stayed here three nights in late August, and I'll not hesitate to stay here again when I return to New York.

<Content>Great...for the price! My husband and I stayed here after having camped in the Adirondaks for a few days. This was to be the pampering part of our vacation...2 nights in New York! I got our room on priceline for 150! I was willing to pay more for a 4 star or 5 star hotel....but that's what i got. I was a little dissapointed when i found out where it was located... across from ground zero! could i handle the emotional impact of being in that location? upon arrival, we requested a  high floor and king... got both! we were on the 29th floor in a delux king VERY big for New York! and yes, the plasma T.V. is huge... but better yet, the bathroom is quite large...with marble and nice Crabtree and Evelyne ammenities. The bed was extremely comfy....and the view was spectacular....we were over-looking ground zero...which was disturbing and sad at first... but it is moving to see that life goes on...we had a beautifull view of the Hudson as well.The decor is a little drab for my taste ..tres modern, but clean and crisp looking.now, for the bad....well, it just feels like a hotel that is pretending to be a 4 star hotel...kinda quickly put together. The lobby for example is small and lacks personality...as does the bar. the staff is courteous enough, but you don't feel special arriving here...i don't know, just lacks a certain je ne sais quoi!BUT the location close to subways, the size of the rooms, and the sleek newness of it all makes it worth it...especially for 150/night!TIPS: century 21 is amazing for deals...got a Marc Jacobs bag for 100...which is 300 reg! also, went to a fabulous restaurant called Kittichai in Soho! to die for... try the chocolat ribs as an appetizer. also, the stage door deli for breaky is the way to go....oh, and you gotta go to Carmines'for some HUGE portions ( i am not kidding do NOT order more than one plate for 2-3 people! i love New York!

<Content>Wonderful Experience - Exceptional Customer Service Even a New Yorker should get away for the weekend! I was impressed from the moment I entered the lobby of the Millenium Hilton,. Although I live in NYC, I took avantage of a great rate to experience the hotel for a special anniversary weekend. As Hilton HHonors Gold VIP members, we were secretly crossing out fingers for an upgrade. We were quite lucky, as we were placed in a junior suite with incredible views, even at a relatively low floor! I had expressed in the comments during my reservation that we were staying there to celebrate our anniversary, and I can honestly say that I am impressed that they not only read the comments I had submitted, but actually wished us a happy anniversary! This may be small, but a time and age (and city) where your reservation is either a number or a last name, a personal touch such as that is quite unusual and highly appreciated. Although I know the standard benefits for Gold VIP members staying at US Hilton hotels calls for either a room upgrade or complimentary breakfast, depending upon availability, I was happily surprised when we were also given two certificates for full American breakfasts (a normally ridiculous $22/person value!).The layout of the junior suite is quite nice, the bathroom space creating a small hallway to separate the living space from the bedroom area. The entire space is pretty compact, but never feels small, due to the large windows and well organized furniture. The king bed was extremely comfortable. Having a corner view of the city behind our 42inch plasma television, we couldn鈥檛 have been happier. We spent some time sitting near the window just looking out at familiar buildings and streets, all from a new angle.Our breakfast buffet was very good (it seems worth the $22 when it鈥檚 free!). As usual, we requested a late checkout of around 1pm, which they graciously offered to us. All in all, I was very impressed by the level of customer service and professionalism of the staff. The building itself was gorgeous in its design, elegant details, and modern feel. The room was not only a sweet surprise, but was furnished with high quality materials and the new 鈥淟a Source鈥?bath products by Crabtree  Evelyn. Having said that, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone in the area, should the downtown location not be a hassle for them. The rates seem (generally) cheaper than the other Hilton properties on the island (even the Hampton Inn鈥檚) and the level of service is truly worth the deal. With all of the reviews I read before hand, I was anticipating my upcoming stay with nothing but excitement, and now that I am here typing up my own review, I look back upon my weekend with nothing but compliments to give to the Millenium Hilton. (Check out my other reviews, including: Hilton Montreal/Laval, Hilton Southbury, CT, Hilton Garden Inn Westbury, NY, Hampton Inn Somerset, PA, Homewood Suites Farmington, CT)

<Content>Superb 10 out 10 Stay at the Millenium the last weekend of July 2005. This hotel and staff are simply fantastic. Arrived in New York for a 3 day visit before heading to Orlando. Arrived at hotel around 1pm and went straight to our room. kids loved the large Plasma screen TV. All the staff were really friendly. Try the back stage deli around the corner for a great breakfast or lunch. Metro is only 1min walk away so easy to get around. Several good restaurants near by to. Will definately go back again and again. 10 out 10.

<Content>Great Hotel - staff keep to themselves Very happy with the Hilton. Across the street from subway so you can get anywhere pretty quickly. The staff were good but really kept to themselves, which i like. Not very central but easy to get to on the subway. Cool TV's in the rooms!

<Content>Great Hotel, Iffy Location The Millenium Hotel is everything you would want in a large urbane hotel. The rooms are quite large for NYC and have great views. The service is warm and accommodating, and the prices are excellent. So what seems to be the issue? The location is directly next to Ground Zero and although I applaud the hotel for opening up again shortly after 9/11, the area is very eerie, especially at night.There simply is not much to do at this downtown location except shop at Century 21 across the street. If you do not mind the subway or taking cabs, it might work for you. As for me, I rather be in the heart of one of New York's more vibrant neighborhoods.

<Content>Sleek, stylish, great subway location Got a corner king city-view room for just under $300 a night, after taxes, which was not too bad considering the good location, convenience, and *amazing* city view from the room. We usually stay in Midtown and enjoyed being away from the congestion of that area. The sleek black tower was easy to find and next to the WTC site. St. Paul's Church right beside the hotel has some compelling exhibits and stories about 9/11 inside and a very old graveyard that is beautiful and parklike. Good shopping is close by too. My spouse was duly impressed for his 40th birthday. Furnishings are modern, and wow did he love the flat screen tv on the wall. Nice beds too. (I continue to *hate* the fridge with the hugely marked-up items and no room for your own soda or water.) In NYC, you don't spend too much time in the room, but we had a chance to enjoy a bottle of wine while gazing out over Manhattan at night, lovely! We appreciated the wine glasses and corkscrew in the room, and I liked the Crabtree  Evelyn toiletries.We did not take advantage of the pool, the lobby bar, or the Church  Dey restaurant, too many other things to do. We did notice that there was wireless in the bar and restaurant, and the lobby bar always seemed busy. My husband is a huge subway fan and loved our central location for getting just about any train we needed, from Midtown to Coney Island. The location is extremely convenient. I'd stay here again in a regular room if I could get some of the under-$200 prices that others seem to be snagging. Normally, I go budget, but this place came through for me when I needed a special occasion room without seeing it first. I will continue to wonder why this hotel spells its own name wrong. Don't let that steer you away. :-)

<Content>Anniversary We had a wonderful time and the service was good. The room was clean and we used the subway (across the street) to get around very easily.We had a nice view of World Trade Ctr renovations. We thought it was very cool - room size was good too. Not a closet.

<Content>Anniversary Getaway The Millenium Hilton is a find in lower Manhattan. For the price (we got a $177.00 per night deal) it was a real charm. This hotel has been nicely renovated to a more edgy funky look but not over the top like some NY hotels. Clean too. Our room was on the 53rd floor, corner overlooking Brooklyn to the East and ground zero to the southwest. Nice and quiet and cosy too. Very romantic overall. Big bathroom and spacious by NYC standards. Located on several subway lines so a quick ride to Midtown and Penn Station. Also located by Century 21 and SYMS for discount shopping. Starbucks is located around the corner for breakfast. Helpful desk staff and concierge. Much better service than in some of the smaller, boutique hotels located in Midtown.

<Content>Great Stay---though out of the way for tourists My wife and I spent six nights at the Millenium Hilton during our first ever stay in New York City. We were on an award stay from Hilton, and they put us in a very nice 25th floor two-room suite over looking Ground Zero---which can only be described as a sobering view. Because of our frequent travel status, we did receive free breakfast coupons, which were great because the breakfast buffet (while very good) costs roughly $25 a head. There are a bunch of places within walking distance for breakfast and lunch, though you will find your dinner options a little limited.The room was very clean and upscale. The beds were quite comfortable, and the sitting room had a fridge, work area, and separate sitting area. The bathroom had a great shower, and the bedroom had a very large flat screen television.If anyone in your crowd likes to shop, the hotel is located right next door to Century 21---which for those of you from the south, is a little like a Steinmart or TJ Maxx on steriods. The only downside, at least for those of us in the tourist crowd, is the location of the hotel compared to midtown attractions. You are a $12-15 cab ride, or a pretty lengthy subway ride to midtown---even more if you are going to the museums on either the upper east or upper west side. Many could see this as a positive, since this hotel is in a very quiet part of town.On the upside, however, you are within a block of two very large subway stations, from which you can catch nearly any of the major lines. The subway is very easy to use, though if you catch a local train, it is probably a 15-25 minute ride into midtown---and you will want to cab it back to this hotel if you come back late at night. Finally, leaving the hotel is quite easy. The bell station arranged all of our travel back to the airport, and actually found us a town car that cost us less than our cab ride in to town.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We had a suite on the 52nd floor overlooking Ground Zero. For me, this was very emotional and unnerving. However, when I thought about the fact that all of these people working here have to deal with this, and may have actually gone through 9/11 across the street, I realized that we all have to do what we have to do and move on. Back to the hotel: I got an exc. deal: $300/nite for a suite (king bed  sleeper sofa). The staff was wonderful and the hotel was convenient to many attractions. My kids loved the pool and I loved the turndown service. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Perfect Views, Wonderful NYC Retreat! We traveled by train from Washington DC to New York on the weekend of July 28th. We had requested an early check-in but when we arrived at the hotel at 8:00 a.m. we did not really expect that our room would be ready at that early hour. We were wrong! Not only was the room ready, but our corner-view room on the 48th floor had as spectacular a view as one could imagine. One wall of windows framed a breathtaking view of the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, and the East River. The other windows looked out toward the Statue of Liberty, and of course, over the site of the World Trade Center. The view of the WTC site was sobering but we were also struck by how resilient the city remains, not only by the expansive view, but by the overall vibrancy of the city.The hotel was very impressive, attractive, well-staffed and extremely well-priced by NYC standards. The room, with it's contemporary furnishings, comfortable size, nice plasma television, was a relaxing retreat after our days and evenings out on the town. The only drawback, and it was a minor one, was that the financial district is not well-stocked with good restaurants. However, Tribeca/Soho and the city beyond are only a short walk away, and buses/subways/cabs are at the hotel's doorstep.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at the Millenium Hotel over the Memorial Day weekend and was quite pleased. The staff was friendly and our room was upgraded to a junior suite so my boyfriends daughter would have the sofabed to sleep on. The room was large by NYC standards and we had a marvelous view of the city. We also had a view of Ground Zero. It was very clean and had nice amenities as well. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Very good hotel Our daughter and her husband were living in Brooklyn (DUMBO) which has almost no hotels. The Millenium's location was perfect as we could walk across the bridge or take 3 different subway lines to within a 10 minute walk of their apartment. Also, all the Manhattan lines converge near the hotel so getting uptown was also very easy. The rooms were spacious with incredible views and the staff was very helpful. The only problems had to do with arrival/departure as it can get very congested in front of the hotel.

<Content>July 4th Holiday at the Millenium Hilton We stayed at the Millenium Hilton from July 3-6th.... Paid $229 with 2 free breakfast buffett coupons per day as a part of their BounceBack deal that I booked directly from their website. We took the path over from NJ to save on the $45 per night parking fee. The hotel couldn't have been more convenient to the Path station. We had a double room for me, husband  sons 15  10... , we were in room 2001 on the 20th floor facing Century 21  the WTC site, it was apparently one of the larger standard rooms.. WOW if these rooms are big for NYC I'd hate to see an average room! The 2 double beds appeared to be smaller than doubles I've slept on in the past..(we joked it's not a California King but a Manhattan Double!) Because they were so small we called for a roll away for DS10 - it was $25 for the entire stay. The TV was cool. The shower heads were small  I would have expected something a bit more posh for the hotel. No turn down service however the first night there were some chocolates sitting on the mini bar but nothing after that.The Stage Deli that was mentioned in other reviews was great! We ate their twice... if you want delivery late at night we found the only thing was Charleys - their Pizza was WAY too greasy. The breakfast buffett was perfect... since it was free as a part of our BounceBack rate... I'd never pay $18.95 Plus Tax for it!! The pool was nice, especially for the kids. While we weren't in the thick of NY, we appreciated the 'down' time  the subways were easily navigated with a small subway map we got from the NYC tourism site. We took a taxi back from the Circle Line (pier 83 or so?) for about $15. I'd definately consider staying here again for the right price...

<Content>Fantastic view Based on the comments on this site I selected a high floor corner city view room. Excellent is an understatement. Words cannot describe how it feels like sitting on your bed in the evening with the lights off looking at New York City.We stayed 3 nights and received complimantory breakfast. We were lucky it was for free because a 2 person breakfast will cost you $44.The location is great. See other comments.Checkin was quick. We arrived at 2pm and the room was ready. No other guests were waiting but it looked like the reception person was trying to break his checkin speed record.Turnover service is great with the chocolates and free water and ice.Breakfast staff was friendly. But they actually highlighted on the breakfast check the words Gratuity not included which I think is a bit inpolite. Especially looking at the price of the rooms I would expect this in a cheap New York restaurant and not in the Hilton restaurant.Overall this is a great hotel and I would love to return one day.

<Content>Great deal and good service Stayed here in May with 4 of my girlfriends in a suite. There was a king size bed and separate living room with a sleep sofa. We got the suited for $299/night. Compared to some of the hotels in New York the space was right on time. The rooms were very clean but beware of the mini-bar. If you touch or remove anything it will be reflected on the bill. My girlfriend moved a beer to place a beverage in the refrigerator and promptly informed the front desk of the situation. An inventory of the items will be taken when you leave and any issues can be settled then. Did I mention the plasma TV to watch by the bed and the 32 in. in the separate living room area. The hotel is DIRECTLY across from Ground Zero/Subway and view was spectacular. Hard to imagine the chaos and horror of 9-11. How could I forget, Century 21 (discount name brand/designer) shopping store was practicully next door and the location is convenient for walking around and site seeing. Cabs and limos were not too bad for the cost. The bellhop (very cute) got us a limo to our Broadway play for $45/roundtrip. It is a short drive to Times Square and the sites there are unbelievable. Street vendors crowd the sidewalks on the weekend so be aware of your surrondings. I will definitely have to stay there again.

<Content>Good but not great.. we stayed at the Millenium Hilton from the 4-7June... very busy weekend at the hotel...unfortunately we were checked in by the guy with attitude... so any request was too much for him... but the other front desk staff were fantastic... concierge was so so, too busy checking his emails to give me his attention.. the porters were always wanting to hail down a cab-don't know if they make money on the side??? we declined their offers and took the subway-very convenient. I do agree with the comment about the turndown service, they must only do it when the have time(as it was done the first night only)... We returned late one night after being out all day and our bed linen was filthy, changed but not clean... so at about 2330 we called to have it changed..  This was my first visit to NYC, next time I would stay somewhere in midtown or uptown... a smaller hotel maybe...but we did get great rates here when most hotels were booked out.p.s we used a cab from JFK to the hotel and they charged the standard US45 + US10 for tolls and tip.. Because i really can't stand getting cabs we took the subway from the hotel back to JFK very easy...Take the A line to Howard Beach and change to the AIRTRAIN to your terminal...US7 ea in total.. The other option is booking a car to and from the airport i think their standard rate is US55 + US10 for tolls and tips..

<Content>Catch Your Own Cab My husband and I stayed just one night at the Millenium Hilton. The front desk staff was wonderful; they even gave us a complimentary upgrade to a Junior Suite when my husband explained that he had flown my mom in as a birthday surprise to me, so she actually had a pull-out sofa to sleep on. The room was huge by NY standards and very clean. The air conditioning unit was loud, but we got used to it. Nice linens. Concierge was hit or miss - and understaffed. The persistant bellman tried to convince us to take a town car back to the airport and when we said no, he flagged down a cab for us, and the cab driver was sketchy and didn't have a medallion number. He charged us more than $20 over the going rate back to LaGuardia and refused to give us his medallion number when we threatened to report him. The sketchiest part of it all was that the bellman tipped the cabbie when we left the hotel. It was clear that the bellman was paying the unlicensed cabbie to take us on the scenic route to the airport. This hotel makes up in ambiance what it lacks in service. We'd stay there again, but call our own cabs! :)

<Content>Best value stay in NYC My wife and I are both in our late 20's, live in London (although we're both New Zealanders) and have now stayed at the Millennium Hilton twice in the last year. We stayed for 8 nights last Sept for the US Open tennis and then for 6 nights in the first week of May for a shopping trip (to take advantage of a public holiday in the UK). Based on conversations with friends and work colleague, I don't think anywhere offers better value - PROVIDED you want to stay in a hotel of at least 3 stars. The best news is that the Hilton is a 4 to 5 star hotel with no inconsistencies in the rooms - and this was a prime consideration as we didn't want to have to deal with the disappointment of pictures on the websites not reflecting reality, I guess this is the benefit of staying at the Hilton. The rooms were very roomy for NY (on our first visit we had to stay a couple of nights at Club Quarters Downtown because of the Republican Convention so we can make the contrast), the bed was big and comfortable and the plasma screen topped it all off. We stayed in a standard room with views over Ground Zero both times, on the 17th and 23rd floors respectively 鈥?the rooms and experience were identical. Our nightly rate was USD200 and USD280 respectively (booked direct through (---) as their rates are cheapest) - for a hotel in NY that is not a lot and I personally think this is exceptional value as you'll pay a similar amount to stay at the Pennsylvania near Madison Square garden and I don't think the two hotels compare (check out the reviews and real pictures on this site). There is easy access to everywhere via the metro. Just beware that if you're coming from JFK, because the hotel is downtown then the advertised flat rate of USD45 does not apply because that only gets you to midtown - this is not helped by the fact that a lot of taxi drivers and private car drivers do not know the downtown roads very well. We never had breakfast there as a) it was expensive and b) we鈥檇 rather eat out of the hotel so I can鈥檛 comment on it鈥檚 quality, but if you want a nice NY breakfast then go to The Kitchenette on 80 W. Broadway at Warren St.

<Content>Nice hotel and facilities We stayed in a parlor suite over the Memorial Day weekend for my daughter's 7th birthday. We were on the 53rd floor with a view over the World Trade Center site - would have liked a city view but the parlor suites don't have that view. The parlor suites are made out of 2 regular rooms with one room turned into a living room with a queen sleep sofa. They are nice since there is a full bath in each room - good for families or business travelers who need a meeting room and want to block off the bedroom. The bedroom had a king bed, desk and TV - nice but nothing super. The room was clean and service was good. The plasma TV is nice but nothing new anymore. Being a primarily business hotel, the TV lacked children's channels and there was no way to hook up a DVD player to it so our daughter could watch movies. The bed was fine but one night the sheets were a bit scratchy so it was hard to sleep.We had a good package that included valet parking (at $45/day a good deal if you drive) and we got free breakfast with my husband's gold hilton membership. They had a nice breakfast buffet, but quite expensive unless you plan to really eat a lot. If our breakfast had not been free, we would not have eaten there but the food was good and the selections plentiful. You can also order off the menu.The indoor pool on the 5th floor was very nice - the main reason we chose to stay there since our daughter loves to swim. The fitness facilities were also quite good for a hotel.Transportation was convenient but if you plan to rely on taxis and want to get to mid or up town, it can take a while. It is best to know your way around since the cab drivers were inconsistent and sometimes seemed to be trying to make money out of their trips.Overall, we had a really good experience and our daughter loved the various views from up high. We would stay there again.

<Content>Loved this Hotel! I really enjoyed staying at this hotel in Downtown, New York. The rooms were really clean, the employees were all very helpful and nice. The view of where The Twin Towers used to be is breathtaking!! Also the view from the rooms of the New York skyline is really nice. It is within walking distance of Tribeca and other areas to explore. If you are looking for somewhere to stay that is close to Times Square....this is no the hotel for you....because Times Square is about 20 blocks or so, which is fine if you are training for a race or are a really good walker.

<Content>Great service, very proffessional Stayed here May 26 to 29 with my girlfriend. Had read lots of positive reviews. We weren't disapointed. Room was ready on arrival. Although we had asked for king size and got queen. Went to front desk and had room changed right away. Beautifull views of course. Away from all the action of uptown but only 12 minutes by subway, station is footsteps away. Not even 5 minutes to canal street, Little Italy and Chinatown..... You must visit Little Italy, its worth the trip. Starbucks coffee right around the corner and stage door deli 1 block away, serve amazing breakfest (try the 4 egg western omelet.wow).. The room was spacious, very modern and clean. Bathroom was amazing, lots of space, pressure and hot water.We checked in Thursday at around 7:00pm, checked out Sunday at 12:00 but were only charged 2 days of parking wich was cool cause at 45$/day, it gets expensive. When we checked out, they stored our bags til we left town wich was appreciated. Guys, if your wife likes shopping, Century 21 is a must, just accross the street but a little tip, be patient..The store is huge, full of brand names and really crowded, easy to lose your wife...Ladies, you can very easily spend 3-4 hours in there, mine almost did.All in all, a wonderfull weekend in New York, but then again, how can you not a fun in New York..Soooooooo much to do. If you're looking for a broadway show, BROOKLYN, THE MUSICAL may not be well known but trust me, worth every penny...amazing voices.All of the people we met and talked with, staff, store employees, policemen, were ALL VERY POLITE AND COURTIOUS, I WAS ACTUALLY IMPRESSED.The city has changed lots over the years, very clean and alot safer than expected...I highly recommend the millenium. A few minutes away from all the action A definite 4 star at a 2-3 star price...

<Content>Millenium Hilton--great in every respect While we were anxious to go to NYC, after reading so many horror stories about hotels there, I was feeling a little stressed about finding an affordable, decent place to stay with our daughters and 4-year-old grandson. Since we were going over a long weekend (May 20-23, 2005), someone suggested the Financial District and so we booked ourselves at the Millenium Hilton at 55 Church Street, directly across from Ground Zero. It was wonderful in every respect. Super convenient to the subway--station was directly across the street and we were able to get to Central Park, Natural History Museum, Intrepid Museum and ferry to Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island without having to transfer subway lines. There are several places to get late night/early morning snacks (Starbucks, Burger King, deli, TGIFridays, Caruso's Pizza) within walking distance so you don't have to pay for hotel-rate food.The staff was very helpful, especially the concierge who let us check our luggage upon arrival and also the day we departed. We had a large room with two double beds and a rollaway which easily accomodated the five of us. We were on the 11th floor, overlooking Ground Zero. The room was very upscale, IMMACULATE, wide screen TV...all the amenities. Nice pool and fitness center on 5th floor which we also enjoyed. And the weekend rate was only $215/night as opposed to hotels in midtown Manhatten that raise their rates on Friday and Saturday. Highly, highly recommend for families who come on the weekend for its convenience, quality of service, exceptional value, and 4-star rooms. I can't think of one complaint!

<Content>Good, modern hotel in convenient location Just got back from my second stay great at the Millenium Hilton. We got a corner room on a high floor with BEAUTIFUL views including the Statue of Liberty. The room was spacious (bigger than standard non-corner room), bathroom was wonderful - lots of counter space, and very comfy bed (and I'm picky). I love these rooms because they are in better shape than all of the other hotels I've stayed in. It was completely renovated in 2003 and has a modern decor, not that busy old-style colonial look with heavy fabrics, etc. Also, since rooms are almost all with one king bed, not many children stay there which keeps down on the wear and tear. While overall I really liked the place for the price (179.00), there were a few odd things. The sheets and towels we got in our room on the first night were wonderful. Luxurious soft and thick high thread count sheets, thick soft towels. However, on night two, they were changed out with ordinary low-thread count scratchy sheets, and towels were smaller and not as nice at all. We got turn-down service with chocolates 2 of the 3 nights. The third night no chocolates. I really could care less about turn-down service, in fact I think it's ridiculous - I can easily turn down my sheets - but a little inconsistent. The room was cleaner than average but not perfect - stain on comforter and on wall, a few hairs in shower. Room was ready on arrival and they held our luggage after we checked out until our train left town. Shower pressure was good with lots of hot water. Didn't use room service or eat at the hotel, too many great places in NY to eat there. We didn't mind the location at all. It is on top of several subway lines and a 20 min walk to the Village. I've stayed in the other Hilton in NYC and this one is far better for a lot less money. Hope this helps!

<Content>This hotel is ok but is being over-hyped in other reviews People seem to be raving about this hotel...and it was fine, don't get me wrong, no better or worse than other hotels in NY. People have over-hyped the rooms a little..they were on par with most hotels of this type in NY, no better or worse, in fact our one bed room was rather small in size, and are you really bothered about a flat screen TV? It was a novelty for a bit, but after that it was hardly ever switched on as we were out and about so much. This is my first experience of staying in Lower Manhattan for a short break and would not choose this location again. It is too far from all the focus of midtown Manhattan...the theatres, museums, art galleries, shops, Central Park...you are forever on the bus or subway going up and down between the two, despite convenient access to certain subway lines. I thought our weekend rate at this hotel to be only average value, all things considered.

<Content>Great hotel I couldn't fault this hotel. The room was clean, tidy and a reasonable size. There was an iron, hair dryer and a safe in the room but no coffee maker which is only a minor gripe. The 42 plasma screen was very nice and there were a wide variety of channels to choose from including the usual pay movies. There was also internet access through the TV and you can checkout using the TV's interactive features which was useful.Room service always arrived promptly and wasn't overpriced by hotel standards. The food was also very good. We only ate breakfast in the restaurant and this was mainly due to laziness rather than the food or service. You are far better going to one of the many Deli's along Broadway which serve a better variety of food and for a quarter of the cost. Beware if you take travellers cheques as they will only change $250 worth per stay. I would advise using ATM's instead of travellers cheques as there are hundreds nearby.The staff were all polite and they were happy to stow our bags after checkout as our flight wasn't until 20:00. Overall a very enjoyable stay and I wouldn't hesitate to go back.

<Content>Excellent Great hotel. Rooms are modern, clean, and a decent size. Elevators are surprising fast. You can control the Thermostat in your room, and you can crack open the window for fresh air. Two things to be aware of.1: No coffee makers in the rooms. There is a Starbucks 30 feet away from the entrance of the hotel, but coffee makers in the room are always a nice touch.2: Room service is very, very pricey. After gratuity, tax, tax and more tax, breakfast for one is $35. There is a little store attached to the Starbucks which has cokes, water, snacks etc, and there are good breakfasts to go places within a block of the hotel. Still an overall excellent hotel

<Content>Excellent hotel, views and location We stayed in this hotel, after 3 nights in the Doubletree uptown and this was an amazing experience, from our room on the 51st floor. The rooms were very clean, views were exceptional over ground zero and overlooking the West side of New York.This is a definite great hotel and worth every penny. The service is very good and the hotel is really well kept. Staff are very friendly.Next time we are in New York, there is no doubt were we will stay: the Millenium!If, like us, you don't know what hotel to pick afraid to be disappointed, well, choose this one, you won't regret it!

<Content>Hilton Manager snubs my online hotel purchase My stay: 4/22 - 4/24/05. Two weeks ago, I purchased three hotel rooms on Priceline for $1,067 for a weekend in NYC. As a resident of NJ and NYC worker, I was extremely happy to have my bid accepted and it was also upgraded to a 4-star hotel, called the Millennium Hilton, located across the street from the WTC. On 4/22, I was checked into an unclean room. It appeared as if someone had used the room and then left in a hurry. Since this is not standard service of any hotel, I called the front desk to complain. After many apologies, the front desk offered me an upgrade to a jr suite but it required a little time to be cleaned. After 90 minutes of waiting in the bar and checking with the front desk on the room status, I was checked into a beautiful jr suite with a fantastic view. Unfortunately, the wireless phone near the bed didn't work so I was forced to use my cell phone along with another family's room. Anyway, the next morning, we left early for shopping. When we returned at noon, a few of us found stained pillows and our phone lines still didn't work. When I called the hotel on my cell phone to complain about the dirty sheets and bad phones, they apologized and sent someone up. Thankfully, the housekeeping mgr came by and apologized for the dirty laundry and he confiscated our pillows. He promised to have our sheets replaced then he offered to comp my family for dinner at the hotel. I was very surprised by the offer and I immediately told him there were 9 people in our party. To my further surprise, he said this number would be no problem. Then about 15 mins later, the front desk mgr called to apologize for the bad phones and explained that they would have to come up and move our beds to repair the wiring. Due to this inconvenience, the manager asked if we would mind moving to some other rooms but I refused the offer because we had already unpacked and had entirely too many shopping bags to contend with. The front desk mgr then offered to comp my room for the valet parking which is $45/day/car and we had 2 cars. Of course I also jumped on this offer and thanked her. Later that night, we all headed to the bar before dinner. While in the bar, I went to check with the front desk to see about our dinner compensation. The clerk promised to check on this and find me in the bar (which was less than 35 feet away). After the standard 90 min wait of checking back and forth, the night manager came to the bar to explain that my hungry party of nine was not going to receive the dinner compensation as promised. Of course, I pitched a small fit during our private conversation. I explained that we were all counting on this promise, especially since a great portion of our day was used to discuss how thoughtful we thought the Hilton was after all the many problems. Unfortunately, the night manager had the nerve to tell me that the Hilton was not trying to pay for our entire stay considering we didn't pay that much for our rooms online. I thought his condescending tone coupled with this statement was in extremely bad taste and very unprofessional. I quickly figured out that he was trying imply that we were trying to scam the hotel when this was not the case. I told him that we were only asking for what we were promised and nothing more. We ended the conversation so he could call the daytime front desk mgr at home. When he returned, he explained in a nasty tone that the daytime front desk mgr was unaware of the dinner comp and she thought the only comp offer was the valet. I told the night manager that it was obvious that their managers had a communication problem and as their customer I didn't appreciate being caught in the middle. Since the conversation was going no where, I demanded their names and the contact names for the General Manager, CEO and the Customer Service Complaint line. I told him I planned to complain. When he returned with the information, he still had a condescending tone in front of my family which was really quite shocking since we were in a 4-star hotel. In all my travels, I have never been made to feel like my money was less than valuable because I used the internet to make the purchase. It's obvious the Hilton's philosophy is that online customers are second class citizens!! Based on my experience, I suggest you patron a different hotel chain. Thanks for listening.

<Content>Best Hilton This is without a doubt the best Hilton I've stayed at within the US. Everything about this hotel was excellent. The junior suite was well equiped and the dining facilities were second to none in nyc. The only downside to the hotel is the location on the weekend. Downtown nyc isn't exactly 'THE' place to be. But I can handle the taxi ride for other advantages of this hotel!!!!

<Content>Perfect stay On a four days week-end in NYC, we had decided to stay 2 nights uptown at the Benjamin and 2 nights downtown at the Millenium, based on TripAdvisor's ranking system.As much as we were disappointed with the first one, we loved staying at the Millenium: low prices for Manhattan, spectacular view, stylish and modern room. The staff was very helpful: the concierge gave us good advice on bikes' rental and transportation back to the airport and they allowed us to check out at 1:30pm at no extra cost.A hotel to recommend and go back to!

<Content>Best Hilton Ever! I have listed all the major points belowDININGThe staff were not welcoming and tried hard to rush you through your meal, it was like their policy. The food was lovely and the fresh fruit was so delicious.ROOMSWe were staying on the 33rd floor and the views were so fab. The celings were high and beds were so comfortable, but a little small for a double. The bathroom had black marble surfaces with a large shower/bath and loo! A giant plasma T.V was great! And the fact the room was so big was nice. The only thing that saddened me was the view of ground 0 at night, it was anawful view, but it was nice to see improvements.CONCIERGEDuring the day the staff were polite and extremly helpful, but at night they are very different. We asked for the nearest sit down pizza place and the lady said erm go down the street and make a left. So we did and found that it was shut! Then we walked about 100 yards further and found a really nice little place!POOL AND EXERCISE ROOMThe pool was great, a big size and was nearly always empty, it had fab views out of the window and the changing rooms were very clean. The pool guy was very helpful with tips of where to go and what to do. And the exercise room looked really nice, clean and pretty average.OTHER TIPSGo up to the 55th floor and look out at the view- its so great, but just dont go into the suites! And if your not so adverturous go down onto the 54th floor and take a look from there. The pool is least busyiest at around 6:30 to 7 PM because closing time is 10 most people like to go for a late dip, and going just that bit earlier means that everyone else will be eating their dinner. Take a look at the flag next to the Concierge bit on the ground floor it has an interesting history to it!

<Content>Some good suggestions... The millenium hilton really is a fantastic hotel! We stayed for 3 nights in January and I thought the reviews on this site were quite accurate. The rooms are small, but I hear that is the norm in New York. We had a view of the reconstruction of Ground Zero - I thought it was amazing. However, if this is something that may bother you, you need to request a room on the other side of the building because you are literally right over the site. There is also very easy access to all subway lines and we took the subway all over the city. Be sure and visit Century 21, the discount department store right across the street. I also highly recommend the Stage Door Deli just accross the street for the best sandwitches in the area. We ate there 3 times in 4 days - the portions are huge and prices reasonable. The best meal I have ever had in my life was at Raouls in SOHO - a short cab ride from the millenium hilton (be sure and make a reservation because the host is quite rude - but it is worth it). It is fantastic and not terribly expensive. A friend who is a local recommended it to us and I assure you it will not disappoint!!

<Content>Highly Recommended Hotel Chose the Millenium hilton after reading trip advisor review and was not disappointed. Sleek hotel with large rooms and excellent views. friends were at the same time staying in the Roosevelt and their rooms were very small in comparison. Staff always willing to help, breakfast in the hotel was the usual hotel standard ie good. also ate breakfast in local eatery just along the road which was also good and of course a lot cheaper, but you do get views from the restaurant over ground zero and it is a lot more convenient to eat initially in the hotel. Taxis are plentiful and the subway is on the doorstep taking only 10mins or so to get you uptown. You can walk to Battery Park to catch the ferry to The Statue of Lberty. You actually see more of New York staying in Lower Manhatten if you take the cabs uptown, than if you have a central hotel which you just tend to walk out of and wander locally. We did the tour of Manhatten in the bus on the last day of our trip and realised that we had already seen most locations when using the cabs to  from the hotel. I found myself giving directions to other folk after only a day or two in new York! If you are looking for a hotel that has a 'happenning' bar/lounge then look elswhere but if you want a clean, efficient hotel with large rooms/bathroom and those plasma TVs with great views and ease of access to Manhatten then I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. If I was returning to New York I would go back to the Millenium tomorrow

<Content>Outstanding Experience I chose the Millenium Hilton for a two night stay in early April 2005 on the strength of the reviews on this site. I was not disappointed. I will definitely stay here again. I would highly recommend this property for the following reasons:1) Excellent subway access, a critical feature in a NYC hotel. Cortlandt Street station (R and W trains) is literally at the entrance stairs to the hotel. Many other subway lines (2,3,E,4,5,6) are within a couple of blocks. 2) The 42 inch plasma TVs are a fun novelty for those of us who would never spend the money to own one ourselves.3) Views - I was on the 41st floor and had a fantastic view of the city.4) Very comfortable bed.

<Content>Great stay Stayed at the Millenium for 6 nights March/April 2005 to celebrate wedding anniversary. Used Tripadvisor to help select hotel and reviews helped us to choose. We were able to gain access to our room without any problems as soon as we checked in at midday. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Advice from the Concierge made for a successful trip. Our room was clean and well appointed-our tv at home seems very small! Views at night with twinkling lights were lovely but obviously one needs to be aware of the hotel location. The church next door has a moving exhibition for 9/11 events.Although the hotel is downtown Manhattan this is still convenient for Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, Battery Park (bus tour) and downtown heliport all within 10 minutes walk. Subway was opposite and a NY yellow cab uptown averaged $10-12.Hotel restaurant was ok and you were able to fill up on the buffet breakfast. Starbucks around the corner from Century 21 was a good alternative. Various restaurants on the ground floor of the Financial Centres opposite were useful for quiet evening meals-good walks along the River Hudson too.A busy but enjoyable holiday. I will have a lasting memory of swimming in the hotel pool at 5.30am-adjusting to time difference on first morning! watching the sunrise over the Manhattan buildings, unmistakeably New York!

<Content>Amazing! We stayed on the 40th floor in the end apartment! We had 2 huge windows, one facing the city view, the other of ground zero and the Statue of Liberty! We were overwelmed by such a view. We stayed February 28th-March 2nd. The staff was pleasant and the beds very comfy. I loved the location of this hotel, kind of away from the hussle and bustle of midtown, but right next to the subway station and Century 21, which is like a huge discount store which came in handy for extra scarves and ear muffs for the unexpected snow storm we encountered. The room service was pricey, but isnt everything in New York! Would stay again!

<Content>Modern Hotel with great views I give this hotel four and a half stars. It is very much as described on the tin. It is a large modern skyscraper hotel. Its USP is the terrific views from the higher floors. My room on the 50th floor on the North West corner had a wonderful view uptown including both the Hudson and East river. Apart from the view, the rooms are spacious, well furnished and with good bathrooms. The beds are very comfortable. The plasma TV can be used to access the internet (for $10 per day). The staff are efficient and very helpful. The hotel is close to subway stations for five of the North-South subway lines, so it is easy to get to points uptown.My only reservation is food. The quality is entirely adequate but it is not outstanding. It is also not cheap.I paid a rate of $242 ($212 plus tax). In my experience this is good value for this level of hotel. I would certainly use the Millenium Hilton again.

<Content>Hilton in Lower Manhattan My wife and I have stayed at this hotel twice. The first time was over the Thanksgiving holiday '04 and the 2nd time was last weekend (Mar '05). Over Thanksgiving we didn't want to stay near Times Square and all the parade crowds so we decided to try this lower Manhattan Hilton property. The hotel has been fairly recently renovated as it sits directly across the street from the WTC site. In fact for both our stays, our room view looked down into the WTC site and across towards the Hudson. Awesome, incredible view but be aware that it might be disturbing for some to know they are looking directly at the at the site of the horrific WTC tragedy. The views on the other side of the hotel are just as good as you look over the city and out at the Brooklyn Bridge and East River.The rooms are nice but not lavish. The king beds are firm but comfortable enough. The bathrooms are average size with a tub/shower combo. Rooms overall are average hotel size with a reading chair and desk. There is internet access for a fee in the rooms however the lounge in the lobby has free wireless access. A nice touch in each of the rooms is a 42 plasma TV! Church and Dey restaurant on the 3rd floor is a decent American restaurant. And the Liquid Assets lounge in the lobby is good but the drinks are expensive (ex. $9 glass of wine). Highlights of this hotel for me have been the very nice indoor pool on the 5th floor (and a nice fitness room). And the location has worked out well, expecially if you fly into EWR. The PATH trains are now working directly from Newark Penn station so you can train from the airport to Newark Penn and then take the PATH train directly to WTC, which is across the street from the Millenium Hilton. Cost for this trip via trains is $8.30 - quite a bargain for traveling from an airport to a hotel in Manhattan. Of course subway stops are nearby and it is a short walk from the hotel to South Street Seaport.If you don't mind riding the subway or other trains around and to Manhattan, (or you can just take taxis of course) this is a great hotel ranging in price with specials from $175 to $225 per night.

<Content>Fantastic! Having read the reviews on this hotel, I was worried that my expectations would be too high but luckily I wasn't disappointed! My husband and I spent 3 nights here from 3rd to 6th March 2005 and found the hotel to be superb in every way. We were originally given a room on the 15th floor but after we spoke to the reception staff about getting a room on a higher floor, we were given one on the 52nd floor! The views day and night were amazing especially as the weather was very clear and fine. The location is great. After my last trip to New York, when I stayed in a grubby hotel in Midtown, I was keen to experience a different area. So many interesting places are walking distance away, such as Chinatown, Little Italy, South Street Seaport and Greenwich Village. Even when we occasionally ventured uptown, the subway station was right outside.The room was immaculate and very clean although it did get quite warm at night. One evening I opened the little window and couldn't shut it again but a member of staff arrived in minutes to assist us! In all, the staff were very helpful, especially the bellboys who always had a smile on their faces! I would DEFINITELY stay here again, particularly when compared to the over-priced dives in Midtown.

<Content>Dumbstruck Nothing but kudos for this place from check in to check out...the room, the staff nothing short of excellent. The view from the room overlooking the trade center and the river beyond, incredible. Here for a weekend and its the kind of quiet you want. Skip all the restaurant recommendations...Church and Day is first rate..you won't be dissapointed. Traveller who's spends 80 nights a year in hotels. This place is a four star rating. Not above...but a solid four. Loved having Starbucksa next door as the only complaint is the lack of coffee maker in the room. And thats the only complaint.

<Content>Loved it Could not find fault with it. The best hotel I have stayed in for a long long time. After reading many reviews here we finally decided on the millenium hilton. Just go for it. You wont regret it.The only thing that you should be aware of: If your room is on the front side of the building, it will be overlooking the WTC site. (I mean directly overlooking). It might put some people off. It is very sad to see it. On the other hand though it made us reflect about it and realise how brave the families of the victims and the people of new york are. SO in that respect it was a positive experience.If you have the chance get room service. It was brilliant.

<Content>Perfect Hotel! Have just returned from a 3 night stay at the millenium Hilton, and I have to say I would recommend it to anyone. Staff were freindly and helpful, the standard of the room was very good (42 plasma screen, say no more !), clean with nice bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. There's a nice bar/restaurant on the third floor that we often called in for a couple of drinks to watch the sun go down, and prices were ok as well. I noticed some reviewers had a downer on the restaurant, but hey you are in New York, if you are going to complain about hotel breakfast/food prices etc. then you should really be out getting some real NY food! There are loads of diners etc. nearby which are just the job. Location is good, the subway is literally right outside of the main entrance and you are in easy walking distance of Soho / Battery Park / South Street Seaport and various others. If you don't mind walking past the twin towers memorial every day (and all the toursists grinning and posing for photos in front of it - missing the point totally!!???) it's pretty good overall. The bell staff had no problem looking after our bags, as we checked out at 12.00 but didn't fly until 8pm, so we had another full day in NY without worrying about our bags. When I come back to NY, I will definately stay here again !.

<Content>great choice for a family we just got back from a weekend getaway with the kids. we were looking for an hotel with indoor pool which was lots of fun for the kids. we got the junior suite on an hight floor which was stunning with an amazing city view. the room was large enought to accomadate all of us. large plasma tv was a great addition. i would not reccomand to eat in the hotel. dinner and breakfest below average and does not worth the expanse.stuff is very friendly. i would defently will go back there for an easy getaway 30min from home.it is fun to be a tourist sometimes even in your own town.

<Content>Highly recommended ! We have just returned from a 6 night stay at the millenium Hilton,we found the hotel to be very coveniently situated in lower Manhattan out of the main tourist throng but with access to Times Suare in under 7 minutes on the subway.We found the hotel facilities to be superb,swimming pool and sauna at no extra charge,fitness room (if req!) and both the lobby bar and the 3rd floor bar attached to the restaurant gave great service in pleasant surroundings.Our room was on the 33rd floor with great views over lower Manhattan and the Hudson River it was clean,modern very spacious and well maintained by the maid.All in all we had a fantastic stay and the hotel is highly recommended

<Content>BEST TRIP TO DATE!!!!! Me and my boyfriend have just returned from a six day break at the Millenium Hilton. It is our best trip to date. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel. Good location for subway links, loved the 42 plasma TV, and the views of the city. Never used the Hotels Restaurant, as there was plenty of good all night delis and starbucks near by. DEF will return!!!!! 10 out of 10!!!!

<Content>Would stay again We stayed at this property Feb 18-20th in rm 3410. It was my husband's birthday so we requested a high floor with a nice view. The room overlooked ground zero and was a decent size for NY standards. There wasn't anything special about the decor, but it was nice and the room was very clean upon arrival. Nice plasma tv, heat controllable by thermostat (no problems) and the bathroom was very clean with Neutrogena amenities. The bell staff was very good and friendly as was the concierge. My only complaint is that on day two, the maid did a very poor job of cleaning the room. I think she just made up the bed. (BTW, the bed was quite comfy with nice linens). I wrote to the Hilton upon my return and they have been extremely responsive regarding my complaint. Also, the turn down service was just that, turn down of the bed only. We have stayed at many hotels in NYC and their turn down service also included a tidy-up of the bath and room. Other than that I enjoyed the hotel and loved the fact that Century 21 is across the street. I would stay here again but would choose someplace else for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel with Great Views I took my husband to New York for Valentine's weekend and stayed here for 2 nights. Could not believe how quickly the lifts took you to each floor- we were on the 37th floor and our ears popped the lifts were so fast. The room had a fantastic view over Ground Zero. An added advantage was being next door to Century 21 - a must for bargain hunters.Quite a few nice restaurnants close by. Can walk to ferry for Statue of Liberty and also walk to China Town and Little Italy.Staff very friendly and helpful at all times. We ate in restaurant which was very good - they do a great buffet breakfast! Excellent value for money for New York!

<Content>Disappointed My husband and I arrived on Saturday, 2/19/05 for a one night stay. We chose this hotel as I had stayed here for business in 2000. Our room was located on the 39th floor and we were told the floor was nonsmoking. When we entered our room, the odor of stale cigarettes permeated the air. A quick call to the front desk and our room was immediately changed to a freshly cleaned room. The room temperature was preset and was much too warm. The termperature guage could not be adjusted by us (only Hotel engineer staff) and we were told to open the window to cool the room. Breakfast at the Church  Dey restaurant located on the 3rd floor of this hotel was just awful. The food was very greasy -- the service was absolutely indifferent. After being seated, we waited 10 minutes for coffee while the 3 wait staff chatted in the bar area watching one of the 3 staff fold table napkins. It was not that busy on that Sunday morning at 9 am. Poor management? Breakfast was much too expensive and not worth the cost. We enjoyed NY city but we will check into other hotels for our next visit.

<Content>Don't overlook or underestimate this hotel! My partner and I just returned from a 3-night stay at the Millenium Hilton. Although a bit apprehensive at first about the location, we were more than happy here. Just about every subway line stopped either in front of or near the hotel (within one block), which meant that Up- and Downtown were just minutes away. We treated ourselved to a junior suite, which was nice as we had a corner overlooking Ground Zero on one side and the Empire State Building on the other! Unfortunately we did not get a room on a very high floor as we arrived a bit late on a holiday weekend in the US, but nonetheless the personnel did their best to accomodate our wishes. Very helpful and friendly, even at 2:00 am when you can't get into your room!!!Only downfall is that the rooms are not completely soundproof, so you will hear the jackhammers at or around Ground Zero. The construction there goes on 24 hrs a day, 365 days a year, so no getting around it! But then again, if you are tired enough you will sleep!As for breakfast, the hotel has its standard buffet breakfast, which we did not go for as down the road to the left of the hotel (next to the Brooks Brothers building) you have a small diner called Panini  Co., where you can have a full breakfast for $ 3 to $ 4. Pretty much all the people we ran into there were from the hotel! Also, if you just want a good cup of coffee, there is a Starbucks next to the hotel plus a baguette shoppe (not all too cheap, but cheaper than the Hilton)! And if you go to Broadway (parallel to Church Street and behind the hotel, you have a myriad of restaurants: TGI Fridays, McDonald's, etc. And all are cheaper than their counterparts in and around Times Square!All-in-all a great stay and we will be going back!

<Content>It was great My boyfriend and I stayed at the Millenium Hilton for the weekend to celebrate Valentine's and our experience was GREAT. We stayed on the 52nd floor and the view was amazing and very romantic. The staff was very polite and prompt. Although the area is busy during the daytime, when we took a walk in the evening it was very quite and pleasent. The plasma tv was a nice touch and the bed was very comfortable. We were very pleased during our stay!

<Content>Loved the Millenium Hilton Visited this great city 3 - 7 Feb 2005. What a great hotel... excellent base for easy access to all new york boroughs, multiple choice of subway routes right on the door step, made it easy to cover a vast area of new york within several days. Hotel staff are really friendly and helpful, lots of local information provided. Rooms are excellent with breath taking views, the beds are a joy!... believe me you will appreciate these comfy beds after a day in new york.... will definatley be visiting this hotel again. Thank-you Tripadvisor, your site is the best, and most accurate guide around, dont leave home without checking this site first!

<Content>Worst stay I have ever had in NY!! This has to be the worst hotel ever!! We stayed two nights in December when it was very cold. First off our heat only worked on high! So we had to crack a window to try and regulate the temperature. When we asked about the thermostat controlling the temperature they just replied our rooms are not sound proof! WHAT??? On our last night we scheduled a 5:30 wake up call, but they never called!! I awoke at 6:00, we missed our flight and had to pay 200.00 in fees for missing our airplane!!! There are too many hotels in the city that are nice. Don't stay here!!!

<Content>loved it..... Great weekend, great hotel Just got back from NY yesterday after staying at the Millenium Hilton. This hotel is great. We were only on the 22nd floor as the person I went with was a bit scared of going much higher. The lady at the desk would have been happy to put us higher tho if we had asked.The room was great and the bed was huge, and yes there was a nice 42 plasma even tho we hardly watched it. The view was great and the room was lovely and clean. The hotel is very far down but the subway connections are brilliant and easy when you know how. We were happy to go out late at night because we knew that the subway was right next to the hotel, if we were going to be getting back late. I booked direct with the hilton so the rates were very cheap (拢72 a night) and well worth it. The staff were very helpful and the concierge desk an absolute blessing. I will definitely stay there again

<Content>Very modern and very cool What a great hotel! A fifty-five story, sleek black 4 star marvel. The absolute best weekend deal in NYC. Go directly to the Hilton website for information on super weekend web-rates. All the employees were friendly and helpful. Check in was really quick....and it was up to the 23rd floor. The MOST comfortable king size bed possible and a 42 inch plasma TV were waiting. I didn't realize it was Martin Luther King weekend (I'm Canadian)....and there were LOTS of tourists. I loved being downtown...away from the crowds. NYC is a fabulous place but there can be too much frenetic energy, and I liked retreating to lower Manhattan. It was very peaceful. All sorts of subway lines are located within a one block radius of the hotel entrance....so NYC is at your doorstep. I think that this hotel is geared towards the business traveller and the prices probably rise dramatically during the week. One word of caution : If a bird's eye view of Ground Zero will bother you...you might want to pass on this one.

<Content>Great hotel I stayed at the Millenium Hilton in December of 2004. It was the weekend before Christmas and I had a very hard time finding a hotel. The Millenium was great and I found a good deal (for New York) after shopping around on the web. The rooms are spacious (for New York) and modern. I was there for fun, but the hotel would be great for a business traveler. The only down side was that it is so far downtown (across from Ground Zero) that you end up on the subway quite a bit, but it's easy because many lines service this location. If you don't mind having a view of Ground Zero, this is a great hotel.

<Content>55th Floor!!! I am just back from two night in the Millenium Hilton at the start of January. I had booked a city view room (paid a little extra) and we good a room overlooking ground zero. I had also requested a room as 'high up' as poosible as I have never stayed in a sky scraper. We we checked in (no delays) we found out that we were on the 55th (top) floor!! The room also had a Jacuzzi bath which was a lovely surprise - and great for relaxing in after a long days sight seeing. Staff were OK, but a little bit brisk even though they weren't all that busy. They were not at all helpful when we were trying to arrange transpost back to JFK. We were given one phone number  were told it would cost 70 dollars. Eventually found a company that only charged 42 dollars. All in all a great stay.

<Content>what's not to like? Was Terrific.. stayed friday left sunday... time in between was perfect ... great , spacious bedroom and bathroom .. great huge plasma tv, plenty of space, wonderful views of the city if requested.... only thing is that it got a bit warm in the room... otherwise location is great too as you have several subway lines just steps from your front door or a block away..what could be better? Access to the east or west side subway lines in an instant! A,C, N,R, 4,5,and some others I can't remember anymore!... Was the Perfect choice for comfort and style! You won't regret it...promise!

<Content>Absolutely Great Just returned from New York - a 9 day stay at the Millenium Hilton in the Finanicial District of NYC. Hotel was perfect. Our room, on 33rd floor, was spacious, modern  clean with a great view over Ground Zero and the location was a perfect base for getting around New York.We didn't eat in the hotel, but food in local Deli's was fresh, plentiful and great value.We loved the City - exciting  well organised, and the subway was efficient  cheap. There was loads to see  do, we found it safe to walk around day and night (perhaps because it was absolutely swarming with police).In any case, if we are ever lucky enough to go back, we would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Sweet memories We stayed here during 22 - 29 November.We arrived around 2.30pm and were checked in and taken to our room. We were on the 39th floor overlooking Ground Zero.This was our first time to New York and we loved our stay here. The room was spacious with a huge 42鈥?plasma screen (not that we had much time to watch it). The bathroom was very clean and fresh towel everyday.We stopped B+B and the concierge was very helpful and friendly. We never encountered any unfriendly staff during our stay. The Buffet was hot and cold choices, for example bacon, eggs, toast, bagels, fruit etc.We thought the hotel was ideally situated, the subway right outside the hotel. Another bonus this hotel was great to get away from all the hustle and bustle to grab some peace and quiet.Loved New York, loved our stay in the Millenium Hilton. Would definitely visit again.

<Content>Excellent holiday base Just back from 8 days at this hotel . The staff were excellent as were the rooms . The concierge was very helpful and never phased by our requests . We were a party of twelve and we all felt that this hotel was excellent. Room service was prompt, taxis readily available . Plenty of places to walk to . I have stayed in other hotels but this was my fourth visit and I was gald to see that since 9/11 it had lost none of its charm on reopening

<Content>Great Xmas Stay Stayed on Dec 26th for 3 nights, they checked us in early which was a bonus. Booked the city view room directly overlooking Ground Zero, for $150 per night from the Hilton website.Room was clean and a good size, especially for NY hotels. 42 plasma tv screen was great and the Hilton Heavenly Bed is the most comfortable at any hotel I have stayed at.Very quiet room and ideal for getting away from the busy streets further uptown. Century 21 is right next door for those who are looking for shopping bargains.We had breakfast once at the restaurant, had good choice in the hot and cold buffet, which cost $16 each. However, on the other days we went to the numerous cheap delis and cafes around the hotel, you'll never be short of choice.The tube stops are right on the doorstep, and is only a 10-15 min metro ride to Times Square, very convenient, and only costs $2 for a single trip. Taxi from airport is $45 flat fee (metered in other direction), but suggest you get the metro from/to Howard's Beach ($2) and the AirTran ($5), takes about about 40 mins.Would agree with some of the other reviews that not all the staff are friendly, however would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.

<Content>had a fantastic time at the Millenium Hilton stayed at the Millenium Hilton from 18 Dec to 23 Dec, had a fantastic time staying there and had no problems checking in.The room was small but clean, the bathroom had everything you needed and the plasma TV was a bonus. It was great to use the pool every morning and the gym is more than adequate. We didn't eat at the hotel during our stay as we thought it was a little expensive but with the Stage Door Deli around the corner and plenty of small restaurants in the vicinity, especially Yori's Japanese on Fulton Street, we didn't see the point of paying out in the hotel.If you want to stay in NYC but want to be able to return to a quieter area away from the crowds the Millenium Hilton would be perfect for you.the only complaints we'd have would be the staff seem a little cold and disinterested when enquiries were made and we were charged for using the mini bar when we hadn't, they quickly reimbursed us the over payment on check out though.all in all our stay in NYC was near perfect and the Millenium Hilton was a big part of it!

<Content>Mostly Disappointed Room not ready upon arrival even though it was after check-in time. We were told that there were 5 pages of guests waiting for their room as well. Front desk said that they would call us when our room was ready...they never did. Also, this hotel is AAA rated 4 diamond and yet you can only get heat or air conditioning depending on the time of year. Granted, we were there in December but a very warm stay and we were uncomfortable the entire time. Opening the window helped slightly. For this rating, you should have all the comforts of home...a choice of heat or air!Room service breakfast was delivered fast and hot but it appeared to annoy servers if you didn't leave an extra gratuity almost to the point of rudeness. That's unacceptable!Would we return to this hotel?A definite NO!

<Content>Xmas Treat Hi allJust returned from the Millenium from Sunday 19th - Wednesday 22nd December. Stayed in room 4206 overlooking ground zero.The hotel was amazing and the room was first class we paid extra for the city view and it was well worth it.The bed was so comfortable, the plasma tv was great, the bathroom was spotless. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom. With ShamWe never ate at the hotel, but shopped at Century 21 right next door!Bought a Metro Subway card which we used all the time, it was nice to come back to the hotel at night away from all the hussle of the city.We asked the conceige about a transfer back to JFK we said it would cost $72 one way! so we used the underground from fulton street to howard beach and then got the air train, $5 each for the air train, so if we want to save some $$$ use the underground back to JFK.We ate at Buba Gump (from the film Forest Gump), Hard Rock Cafe  Planet Hollywood.We also seen the Knicks at Madisson Square Garden you can book online from ticketmaster.We loved our time in New York, it also snowed on Sunday night which made our trip even more special.Thank you Hilton for making our visit so special. We will return.

<Content>Good..but not Great! We were a little dissappointed to say the least. The Hotel itself overlooks 'Ground Zero'. Transport links are superb with the subway on 1 x minutes walk from the hotel. If your booking independently CHECK what your getting for your money. Ask about the special deals or rates which are available. 'Bounceback Rate' was $219+tax per night for 2x adults and 1 x child and included a self-sevice buffet breakfast. If you like your 'breckie' hot I would avoid the buffet. Kids are charged for breakfast depending on who your Waiter is! Hotels is immaculate and has leisure facilities inc. a small pool  sauna.We were lucky and recieved a FREE upgrade on our late arrival to a 'Junior Suite' a saving of $100 for 4 x nights( $400 in total)! Biggest Bed I've ever seen  42 inch plasma screen TV, seperate living area with fold out double bed with TV mini bar and all the usual you would expect from the Hilton Group. Bathroom was immaculate.Athough I could find nothing to complain about the place felt cold! Staff were curteous but were unable to interact with Guests - I had visions of the 'Stepford Wives???' - Having stayed in other Hotels in the Hilton Group I can say that this Hotel was good - but it should have been GREAT! Can't fault anything but the 'coldness' of the Staff!

<Content>A very good hotel Stayed in this hotel for our first visit to New York from 26th November until 1st December after having read the reviews posted on this site.We had a room on the 24th Floor overlooking Ground Zero, check-in was hassel free and we were in the room before 3pm, the bed was indeed very comfortable and the plasma screen tv big, my only complaints with the room are that you could hear toilets and showers being used in the other rooms, and the chairs were not very comfortable.We had breakfast the first morning in the hotel restaurant and I would not advise anyone to do this as there are many cheaper places around the hotel ($46 for two buffet-breakfasts), such as Andrews coffee shop on pearl and john street.The staff were very helpful with the exception of the concierge who on a number of occasions got into the lift before us whilst we were waiting and did not ask which floor we would like.Whilst I agree with other reviewers that this is an excellent hotel I wouldn't reccomend it, as it really is out of the way and whilst there is a subway station opposite, the system is not very outsider friendly, such as knowing the direction of the train or the next stop indeed if the train even makes a stop at your required station as the notices advising of the stops are small if non existent.Nonetheless anyone spending a few days in New York would not be dissappointed with this hotel.

We loved being in lower Manhattan and away from all the crowds. There is a subway stop right outside the door of the hotel, so getting to all the shopping and sights is a breeze. The hotel was clean, quiet, and extremely comfortable. The bed was so comfortable I had trouble pulling myself away from it (and the plasma T.V.). The only thing that was lacking was an in-room coffee maker...but with a Starbucks 100 feet from the hotel, I can't really complain! Will definitely stay there again!!!

<Content>Most enjoyable Second visit to NYC this year, second time I have selected a hotel on the basis of the recommendations on this site (Sofitel Hotel being my earlier visit) and the second time I have been very pleased - read the reports, they say it all! The only point of caution is price, I booked through the Hilton website two months ago for $199.00/night for a four night stay, although I noted in some places it was quoted as high as $384.00/night (Plaza prices)!I would also like to offer my praise for this site. Having been introduced to this service twelve months ago I have made several bookings in both US and the UK and the general overview from the reports listed have proven to be pretty accurate and now form the basis of all my hotel selections.

<Content>Perfect. I took my girlfriend to NYC to propose and so a NICE hotel was in order. We're used to backpackping and staying in hostels or budget hotels but THIS weekend was special. So after reading the stellar reviews here I booked it and crossed my fingers. AND...it was perfect. The room was great. It is just like the pictures they provide. The bed WAS very comfy and the HUGE TV was a big plus. A nice room is #1 on the list for me, then service, location and of course price. This hotel was great in all these areas so I DO recomend it. The view was dominated by ground zero which may be a consideration for some.Kyle Dunlevy

<Content>Pretty Good A pretty good hotel with reasonable service.We stayed in a king sized double on the 11th floor with a view over Ground Zero. The room was fine, though a little small. The room service trolley wouldn't fit past the bed!As for location, it's ok. It's not in the heart of things (e.g. Times Square) but it's an easy subway ride to pretty much anywhere. Century 21 is just next door.

<Content>Millenium Hilton,Church Street We stayed at the Millenium Hilton opposite ground zero.On arrival the staff were helpful and friendly.We checked in quickly and the the room was clean and seemed very airy.There was plenty of storage space and a safe in the room which had no charge for usage.The location was near the statue of liberty and ground zero,and right next to century 21 shopping (a shoppers paradise of heavily discounted designer names ).We were quite a distance from midtown and central park but surrounded by subway stations which made reaching them easier.We only stayed 2 nights and did not try the restaurant because we had a list of places to visit and eat at.The concierge was particulary helpful and knowledgeable and gave us helpful information on how to get about and what to see and when.In common with most hotels the mini bar was very expensive so we bought drinks and sweets in the deli just around the corner .Would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Loved the Mellenium Hotel We stayed at Mellenium Hilton Hotel on October 23, 2004 and it was fabulous! The room was clean and not smelly. The furniture was updated with comfortable mattress and premium bedding. The view was magnificent and room service was fast. It was like home away from home. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great views, spacious rooms. Just back from a four day stay at the Millenium Hilton. I agree with all the positive comments posted here. My travelling partner has visited NY 5 times and agreed that this had been the best hotel that she had stayed in. The location was perfect as everything was very accessible either by walking or public transport. We were given a room on the 45th floor which had a great corner view of The Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge. Amazing to wake to the sun rising over that every day and at night the lights bringing the city to life. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.

<Content>Great hotel! Just returned today from a 2 night stay at the Millenium Hilton and had a great time. The room was clean and large and we had a wonderful view of the Statue of Liberty from our window. The hotel is directly across the street from Ground Zero which is quite a place to see and remember. If this bothers you you probably should make sure before you check in that your room isn't in the front of the hotel. The staff couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. The subway station is right across the street and will take you uptown to Times Square,Rockefeller Center,etc.,but make sure that you know exactly which stop you need to get off at or you could get lost easily if you don't live in Manhattan. It may be hard to use the subway if you have very young children(we were with 9 and 12 year olds that complained alot about it!). There is a great deli,Starbucks,and a Dunkin Donuts all within easy walking distance from the hotel which is really nice. We also walked to Battery Park and took the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. We thought the location was a nice retreat for us after long days of walking around in the city and we had no problems with noise at all. If you can get a good rate,this is a great place to stay while visiting NY and I'd give it an A!

<Content>Overall great, but Overwhelmed staff For my first time in Manhattan, we chose one night at the Millenium Hilton. The room was modern, clean, and roomy (I was concerned given reviews about small hotel rooms in NYC). Bathroom was large, bright, and very clean. We had made reservations for a king bed (the only thing available on the Hilton reservation site), but they let us change to 2 double beds at check in (no extra charge). We had a partial view of Ground Zero. The room was very quiet during the night despite the fact that the hotel was either at or near capacity.When we checked in at 9 AM, we left our bags---the front desk was very quiet and the person behind the desk very helpful. When I returned at 4 PM to actually pick up my keys, it was a different story---with 6 people behind the desk they seemed really overwhelmed and there was a line that seemed to last longer than it should have. Getting someone to help with my bags up to the room seemed impossible, so I took my own stuff up, which was OK, except for the fact that when I got to the room, neither of the two keys that they gave me worked. Called down with the phone in the hall and a security person came right up, confirmed my ID, and gave me a key that did work. I have never had this happen in all my personal and business travel, and I can only attribute it to the overwhelmed front desk.We did not eat at the hotel, but had breakfast at the Stage Door Deli right next door---it was fabulous. There is a Starbucks around the corner too.Besides the front desk, the only thing not so great about this hotel is the location. As my first time to Manhattan, I had no idea as to distances, where things are, etc. Next time I would stay closer to Central Park and the shopping district. Although it was raining when we left, the hotel staff were able to get us a car immediately to the airport at a reasonable price.Despite the check-in issues, I would stay here again if I needed to be downtown.

<Content>Thumbs Up This was a very modern, nicely appointed hotel. The room was very spacious with stylish furnishings and comfortable linens. The location is great if you plan to spend time in lower Manhattan with easy access to the World Trade Site and the Statue of Liberty. The hotel was not very close to the trendy restaurants, shops and nightlife in Soho and the Village, which are a long walk or short cab ride away. Joggers will love the access to Battery Park and nice paths along the river. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Fabulous Absolutely fabulous! From the moment we arrived we were treated exceptionally well by the staff. There was no line at check-in and our room was upgraded without even asking. We had a corner room on the 39th floor and the view was amazing. The pool area is beautiful and relaxing with soothing music playing while you swim. Our vacation here was wonderful.

<Content>Expensive, but worth it!!!! Arrived in NY at 6:30am, check-in wasn't until 3pm, but the front desk was kind enough to let us check in our bags and call us on our cell phones as soon as an available room was ready. The people there were really helpfull, kind and considerate. Even the bell guys helped us find places to go for the meantime until check in.We finally got a call an hour and a half before 3pm, which they gave us the choice on the 21st or 12th floors. The room was kinda small but more than enough room for 2 people. It had an amazing 48 flat screen TV, marble bathroom counter, an executive desk, and views over the late WTC and Hudson River from a far.As stated in most of the other reviews, Ground Zero was across the street of the hotel, Century 21 shopping was on one side, while the oldest church in NY was on the other. During the day, the streets are jam packed with people going to work, or visitors paying their respects to Ground Zero, at night... empty. It was so convenient to have the subway just a couple steps from the hotel to bring you wherever you wanted to go in the city, plus taxi comming around every second to look for passengers. If you got the legs and pretty fit to walk a long distance, you can always walk 5-10 min north to Canal St, Chinatown, shops in broadway, and SoHo's. Another 5-10 min south to battery park to catch a cruise ship to see the statue.Overall, the stay was wonderfull. Ive visited NY 7 times with friends but usually staying close to busy Time Square where most of the other places were equal to run down roach hotels that need renovations. Millenium is the perfect place to stay with your significant other, where its busy during the day, slow and relaxing at night, and convenient for any method of public transportation.

<Content>Very Pleasant Stayed here for a one-day visit with an old friend. Had a delightful time. The room was big with a great view of the city. The staff were pleasant, and they gave us an extra 2 hours in the room when we asked for late checkout. Breakfast in their restaurant was nothing special and pricey. Walking around ground zero was sobering.

<Content>Great Views/Great Stay We stayed at the Millenium Hilton from 30th Sept to 3 Oct for a joint birthday/anniversary do' and we loved it! Our king corner room was on the 53rd floor and we had such fabulous city views, I found myself waking up in the wee hours of the morning just to see the spectacular sunrises. Watching the sleepy city come to life was one of the high points of our trip. The evening views were wonderful as well, with the buildings all sophisticated shimmer. Probably to the shock of a few dedicated office workers, we slept with the curtains wide open, just to revel in the wonderful glittery magic.I often use Trip Advisor and I'm pleased the reviews were spot on. We stayed at the Regency on Park Avenue earlier on our trip and did not like it at all! Overpriced, snooty and the room was dull in comparison.I would have liked a coffee pot, but we had a Starbucks right around the corner. It really is taking over the world! The room was very clean, room service efficient and we enjoyed the plasma television. My husband had a hard time saying his goodbyes.I agree with other reviewers that ground zero was a sobering experience. I was a bit apprehensive before we visited as I wasn't sure what to expect - but people paying their respects seem to bear this in mind and it makes it a lot less of a circus affair and more of a quiet, respectful memorial. Still difficult to take in though...The staff at the hotel were cheerful and helpful. We read about the electronic fridges so didn't even attempt to open it to gaze at the forbidden goodies. There is a giftstore downstairs with (still) expensive and limited snacks, but a lot cheaper than the minibar. Around the corner from the hotel you will find a few shops that sell ciggies, beverages and sweets - stockup for midnight munchies. The hotel has icebuckets and ice for your sodas. We had breakfast only once in the hotel and found it expensive and so-so. There is a Stage deli near the church half a block away, or wander around until you hit a diner type serving breakfast.The area is very rushed during weekdays (especially lunch!) with all the workers milling around. The weekend can be a little bit of a let down with some restaurants only catering to the Mon-Fri crowd, but this is an excellent time to get some shopping done or visit some of the other places on your list like Chinatown.Speaking of shopping - Century 21 is right next door - Their motto is 'New York's best kept secret', but we joked that the secret was out because EVERYONE seems to know about it. We foolishly attempted to shop on Friday at 5:30 PM - we could barely walk through the store. We returned on Sunday afternoon and it was slightly less crowded. South Seaport is a short walk away - a nice surprise and a twist on the usual mall scene with good seafood to be had. It is relaxing just to walk around and look at the boats and water with benches for you to gaze and take in the tranquility. Greenwich, Soho etc/ all a subway away for more trendy shopping - and Times Square is dead easy to get to for more hectic fun. From our hotel window we could see the Statue of Liberty and the fabulous Brooklyn Bridge. We enjoyed Ellis island and the boat ride provided some good photo opportunities.Overall we really enjoyed our stay and will be staying here again.

<Content>Will definitely return! We booked our Sept. 21-24 stay in NYC at the Millenium Hilton based on reviews we read on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. The location is fantastic. Our room was not ready when we attempted to check in but then it was only 11 a.m. They upgraded us to a Junior Suite on the 23rd floor overlooking Ground Zero. Besides the remarkably clean room, we fell in love with the Plasma TV. We found ourselves returning to our room early just to lie in bed, sip wine and watch the big screen TV. The staff was the best from check in until check out. Friendly, courteous and efficient. I especially loved the nightly turn down service with bottled water and chocolates each evening. I used to be a hotel maid so I tend to be a harsh judge of cleanliness in hotel rooms. Our room was spotlessly clean each day and I commend the housekeeping staff. We had only one problem when we were charged for the mini bar when we did not use it. I understood though because each item has an electronic eye under it which we set off when we removed some items to look at them. The front desk happily took our word for it when we called and took the charge off the bill with no questions asked. We are Diamond Level Hilton Honors members who will continue to stay at Hampton Inns worldwide because we feel they work very hard to retain their customers.

<Content>Gave away our room! Booked room through priceline for a weekend of sightseeing and shopping with family from out of town. The rates were reasonable, around $175.00/ night (non-holiday weekend), but was dissappointed to find that they do not have any double occupancy rooms. We were forced to reserve 3 rooms to accomodate everyone. The rooms are decently-sized and clean. Each room has a large flat screen tv and a king sized bed. The location is excellent, very close to canal street (Chinatown, Little Italy) and directly across the street from the World Trade Center/ Ground Zero. We had a dead on view of what used to be a modern marvel; 2 110-story office buildings which were cities within themselves. I spent a lot of time staring out the window reflecting on 9-11, it was a humbling experience.Ok, here are my biggest gripes with this hotel:1) There is NO lobby, and the small foyer in which you check in and out is so crowded and you will be waiting a while so I would suggest you stay somewhere else if you are at all claustrophobic. Also, this means there is no where to sit and relax or hang out. 2) The breakfast buffet. The bill was over $80 for 4 of us to eat at the buffet at the hotel's restaurant Church  Dey. The buffet was small, poorly stocked and WAY over-priced. There was hardly any food left when we ate at 10:00 a.m. on Sunday.3) The parking staff is hurrendous. We called ahead as they advised us to in order to avoid a wait. We packed and made our way down to the garage 45 minutes later to get our car only to wait another 45 minutes. No one would even look at us or ask us if we were being helped and finally after 25 minutes the attendant asked for our voucher. It was only then that he told us we had to have the voucher validated at the front desk first. We had to go back to the front desk and wait on the long line of guests checking out to get the stamp. Mind you, we had already waited on the line to check out, so I was very irritated to have to do it again. The parking staff was rude and unapologetic.5) Examine your final bill carefully, they charged us for items in the minibar that were not taken. Seems they will charge you if you move an item to a different spot in the fridge even if it's unopened.6) Last but not least, we had reserved 3 rooms, however the third room would not be occupied until the second night. We realized this glitch in our schedule too late to change our reservations so we decided to check all 3 rooms in upon arrival and leave the 3rd empty for the 1st night. We asked them to hold the keys at the front desk for our 3rd party until their arrival. All 3 rooms were to be adjacent to eachother on the same floor. When it came time for our 3rd party to get their key, the front desk informed us that they had given the room away. The room we had ALREADY PAID FOR! Turns out they, LUCKILY, had ONE room unoccupied that night due to an early check-out. We had no other choice, so we took the room which was on another floor. The front desk staff handled this situation terribly. They never apologized or seemed to realize what an inconvenience they had caused us. Had there been no more rooms in the hotel, what would we have done? PLUS this room was already paid for AND checked in! How could they have given it away? Bottom line, I wouldn't stay there again. Got a room at the Waldorf for $200 on Priceline for a holiday weekend and it was well worth the extra $25!!!

<Content>Awsome views We stayed Fri and Sat nights on a 45th floor room. The hotel is across the street from the WTC site, so we had a lot to think about. Aside from ground zero, we had beautiful views of the city and the Hudson, and could even see mountains/hills in the distance. We got a deeply discounted rate by paying in advance (non-refundable).The hotel is across from the PATH train station to New Jersey, so this is a great location if you are coming in from Newark Airport. There are subway stations all over the place, so you can go anywhere from here, but be advised that the downtown area itself is pretty dead on the weekends. Many restaurants actually close up Sat and Sun, but you can take the subway to where you want. Chinatown is a moderate walk. For discounted theater tickets, the TKTS booth is nearby. (They have another booth in the Times Square area, but it has longer lines.) Of course, you can also walk down Wall St. or take a boat over to the Statue of Liberty, and I really enjoyed the South Street Seaport.The rooms are very nicely furnished, although a bit smallish. The plasma screen TVs are obscene overkill - who is going to sit around watching TV in NYC? The staff was courteous and helpful. I was disappointed that there wasn't a coffee machine in the room - I've gotten used to that as standard feature. There is coffee off the lobby for $1.75+ a cup. The way my wife guzzles, this can get a bit pricy.Oh yeah, don't touch anything in the mini-bar. It's computerized, so when I took something out to put my own soda in the fridge, it automatically registed as a change of $4.85 per soda. (Do some people really get that thirsty??) I had $30 of charges on my bill. They were nice about it and took them off, but it did take about 20 extra minutes at check out. I learned that this is not a fridge, it's a booby trap.Aside from that gripe, everything was great.

<Content>Good Stay, Good Service I was in NYC for the US Open and was very happy with the service I received. Although I had a few glitches with the bill, (being charged for the mini-bar that I never used) the front desk was extremely helpful and attentive. As was the concierge with tips on where to go for dinner, etc. One note though, the walls between the rooms are a tad thin and I was awakened at 3am by a couple arguing quite loudley. Otherwise great stay!

<Content>Anniversary weekend with a fractured foot We spent our 39th anniversary weekend at the Millenium Hilton. A week prior, I had fallen and fracured the bottom of my left foot. All our plans had been made and I hoped that being in a wheelchair would not ruin everything. From the moment we left our car, the weekend was perfect. The staff were wonderful and couldn't do enough to accomadate us. Our room was lovely. It was a corner room with a beautiful view both during the day and at night. The housekeeper on the 49th floor was so helpful and kind that it was almost like visiting with an old friend. The first night, we had reservations at Delmonico's, but enjoyed the brunch and dinner the second day. Brunch was well prepared, but not extensive, however the service was excellent and friendly. At dinner, the food was excellent and the wine list is comprehensive. Again, the service was warm and impressive. Every staff member from the dining room manager to the waiters was helpful, yet not intrusive. They escourted us to the elevators and made certain my wheelchair was in place before closing the doors. It was only a short two days, but we felt as though it had been much longer, it was such a lovely respite. We plan to return soon, but not wait for a special occasion.

<Content>Nice Business Class Hotel I just returned from my second stay at the Millenium Hilton and I recommed it for both business travelers and for tourists. The hotel is across the street from the World Trade Center site, so that fact may deter or disturb some visitors, but I found it okay and even visited the memorial more than once. Also, the hotel is within easy walking distance to the Financial District, Battery Park and the waterfront so if you want to see some of NYC while on business, the location helps. I found the hotel staff helpful. The standard room was nice with high speed internet access and a great flat screen TV. The bathroom was large and well-appointed. Food from room service was quite good, and the bill was not cluttered with padded fees and charges. Overall, in a city of hundreds of hotels this one would not be a bad choice.

<Content>Best weekend value in NYC! My friend and I stayed at the Millenium twice. It's just our favorite hotel in NYC. The weekend rate of about 135USD/night is outstanding. I find the reception staff efficient and friendly. A big smile and a polite request scored us a suite! It was simply beautiful! The furnitures were sleek and of high quality. The towels and bathrobes were great. The toileteries were average. I had my best sleep in NYC on the Hilton Millenium bed. The location is great. It's just above a subway station. It's my personal NYC hotel of choice for a weekend. I understand during the week, the rate goes up quite a bit due to its proximity to Wall st. I hope you enjoy the hotel as much as I did.

<Content>Wonderful Stay What a great hotel. The location is convenient to just about anything you'd want to do in mid-town and Lower Manhattan. The lobby is well appointed making for a nice place to have a cocktail in the adjoining bar. The elevators are very fast and accessible (important since our room was on the 49th floor). The room was nice (bed EXTREMELY comfortable) with an awe-inspiriting view of Ground Zero. The ONLY criticism would be the concierge. She was friendly and helpful the first night of our stay, then a bit dismissive the second. Oh well, I would love to stay there again and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place to spend a few days.

<Content>Excellent Value For what we paid, I was very pleased with the hotel. There were some minor things that could be improved upon, but overall, I felt like I got a great deal.One thing that bothered me was the way the bellman snap counted the bills when he was tipped and basically asked for more.

<Content>Don't let the hotel star rating fool you I was told when I complained about the condition of my room, that the hotel was in the process of renovating. My main complaint was reguarding the bathroom, it was covered in midew and rust both in the tub and around the sink. My secondary complaints were really minor things like a couple holes in my sheets, black marks on the ceiling, no plastic bag for the ice bucket and poor house cleaning pracitices like not replenishing shampoo and drinking glasses and removing the old ones.  I did not complain about these things until I checked out where I was then asked to fill out a complaint form for the manager to see. The desk clerk was apologetic but that was it.  (my stay was on Aug 25th and 26th 2004)

<Content>Great Location Have now stayed here twice. The hotel represents good value for NYC and has an excellent health centre and pool. Other public areas are also impressive. Its location is spot on for sightseeing and accessing the subway. Rooms are average in size yet well appointed and are spotlessly clean. A solid choice!

<Content>can't rave enough For a hundred bucks (Priceline) I got a large super-appointed room on the 47th floor with a spectacular view, plasma tv, gorgeous linens, lush bathroom, tasteful modern sleek furniture. I couldn't believe it. It's next door to fashion bargain heaven, Century 21, and because they don't let you try anything on, you can do so back at your room and return accordingly. Staff was very freindly knowledgable and fast.

<Content>Once again, spectacular. This hotel is one of my favorites in New York! I rate it above the Ritz-Carlton, W hotels, Tribeca Grand, and other 4- and 5-stars I've frequented. Our most recent stay was on a whim at the end of June; we were going into the city to see one of the Fahrenheit premieres, and decided to stay over because we love New York so much. Our cityview king room on the 51st floor had a breathtaking view of the Hudson River, ground zero, and to the north, the West Village and the Midtown skyline. When you reserve, make sure to request a room above the 45th floor. You will be above it all - especially if you stay before they construct the new world trade center. I sincerely recommend the King Corner rooms - when they're available, they're my favorite hotel rooms in New York, save for, maybe, the suites at The Donald's place... :) The bed was awesome...not quite a Heavenly Bed, but we slept wonderfully. The best features of the room always are the huge plasma screen TV with web access, and the big, comfy ergonomic leather chair at the desk. Room service was surprisingly good for the Hilton, but if you must eat their food, go downstairs to the Church  Dey dining room and have a proper dinner. For breakfast, there's a starbucks right next door and around the corner on Dey street. This hotel is convenient to the Tribeca/Soho party scene; the Tribeca Grand hotel is directly up Church st.. We enjoyed being in close proximity to the World Financial Center shops and the very cool Irish Hunger Memorial (located on the river across the street from ground zero), which we were able to see from our room. Now, about the staff. I've read people's complaints about rude or short employees that did not come off as overtly friendly...well...the truth of the matter is, the Millenium Hilton is a very large hotel, and the staff does seem rather stressed at times. However, if you take it all with a grain of salt and don't expect to be treated like absolute royalty (that's what $500/night places uptown are expected to be for), you will see that they're just simple hard working folks in the hotel business who are trying to run a first class operation. Oh - I almost forgot. The health club and indoor pool are fantastic, especially very early in the morning when they're empty. They also have a business center where you can print documents from the internet. If you can score a rate of under $199 per night, you'll love this hotel even more. Hilton, keep up the good work!

<Content>Loved it!!! I stayed at the hotel in May with a friend and we loved the hotel. It was very modern looking. The hospitality desk was excellent, great service. We had a view of ground zero from our room. The subway was located directly across from the hotel, which was very convient. Also, right next door was Century 21 department store, which was outstanding. Great deals for those who love to shop! The hotel was clean, bed was comfortable, bathrooms were clean and had a beautiful sink. Room service was good. I am eagerly anticipating a return stay in New York and would definitky stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Good value for money Had 3 nights here in early July. I booked through Hilton's website and got a very good rate. Check in was easy and bags were delivered to the room within 5-10 minutes. Room overlooked WTC site and thanks to pretty good weather, the views were great. Overall the room was clean and modern looking. The big plasma screen TV made it easy to watch TV. The king sized bed was comfortable for sleeping - not too firm and not too soft. If you are a late sleeper make sure you put the Do Not Disturb Sign on your door, as the maids and mini-bar refillers will be pounding on your door otherwise. The pool downstairs was a nice addition. Room service was fine for both food quality and service speed. Internet connection for my laptop was easy. Didn't try the restaurants. Mini bar stuff is expensive (no surprise there). There are lots of places in the neighborhood for both food and shopping, so if you have no pressing needs to be in Midtown, your stay here should be satisfactory at the very least. All employees were friendly and helpful.

<Content>Sorta average My wife and I stayed here for 2 days - June 25-27 - and had high expectations based on the reviews. Our first impression was not particularly good. We arrived very late into the evening around midnight due to massive airline delays. Upon hitting the hotel's front desk, there was no one to be found. The bellman had to go search for the front desk clerk who finally arrived after about 5 minutes. No apology (yet no attitude either). While waiting, we picked up a strong odor of insecticide throughout the lobby and when we inquired we were notified the hotel just got sprayed - mmm yummy! Anyway, checked into the room which was decorated nicely tho a bit small but hey it's NYC. Next, wanted to check out the piece of equipment that brought me here in the first place...the plasma. Big dissapointment. Not hi-def and in fact, most programs had horrible reception. Other points to note, bathroom very nicely done. We asked for but didn't get a corner room b/c the hotel was sold out for the weekend. We did get the requested city (non-WTC) view. Would I stay here again? Probably given the decent rates but would temper my expectations a tad.

<Content>Loved the view from our room My husband and I stayed at the Millenium Hiltonfor one night on July 4th. Our room overlookedthe world trade center site. The corner stone was just delivered when we got there. Verytouching view. Had a king size bed with theplasma tv. Very quiet room. Not one bit ofnoise all night. Saw Macy's fireworks atSouth Street Seaport, just spectacular! Shortwalk from our hotel. The heated pool was great!Restaurant a bit pricey for breakfast. We both just had a memorable great stay.

<Content>Couldn't be better! We chose the Millenium Hilton after having seen it from the outside on a previous visit to New York - it is in our favourite part of the city and the sleek black tower looked impressive. As we were going back for our New York wedding and honeymoon we wanted everything to be just right. I was worried by some of the previous reviews which I had read before I left for New York. Well, I returned from New York yesterday and can honestly say that our stay in the Millenium Hilton was perfect. Other people have reported check in problems. We arrived early (2.10) and they checked us right in without a problem. The girl on the desk was efficient and when I asked if we could have a high floor for the view she allocated us a room on floor 52 which was a dream come true as this hotel has some of the best views in town. The bellhop was friendly and also efficient, escorting us to our room with our luggage. The elevators are amazingly quick and each floor only has eleven rooms (or thereabouts) which reduces noise and traffic in the corridors and means you don't have far to go to reach the elevator. The area outside the elevators on each floor is carpeted, so no footsteps while you are trying to sleep, and has a huge window with views to the rear of the hotel (i.e. the other side to the view from your room) - including the Brooklyn Bridge and the Woolworth building, and City Hall. Whatever floor you are on, you can travel to a high floor to see this. The room is a fair size for a New York room, with a wonderfully comfortable bed, tasteful furnishings and of course that plasma TV. You also get a desk with a reclining leather chair, and comfortable fabric covered chair, a small drinks table (plus glasses and an ice bucket of course), and more storage space than is usual in city hotels. Monday to Friday you get a newspaper at your door. The safe is easy to use and a handy feature. The bathroom is the best hotel bathroom I have seen, spacious and spotless. In fact everything is perfectly clean, and housekeeping are very thorough when they visit each day and also polite and friendly if you happen to meet them. Towels and bedlinen are all spotless and look new. The Neutrogena toiletries are a welcome touch and these are replenished if you use them so there is more than enough for your stay. And I haven't even told you about the best bit yet - the view! Yes, it is dominated by the World Trade Centre crater, but the work there now is preparing for rebuilding rather than tearing down (though one building remains to be dismantled). The World Financial Centre is opposite, and the Hudson river beyond where you can see some spectacular sunsets. Words can't do justice to the sight you see each time you draw back the curtains on the floor to ceiling windows but for us it was the highlight of our stay in New York. Each time we returned to our room it was a pleasure to be in this clean, comfortable, cool haven after the busy city streets, and to relax by the window and watch the hustle and bustle below was the best bit of all. The only thing that didn't work was the Interactive check out through the TV but we had nothing to pay on our account (no rogue charges at all, thankfully) and it took only a couple of seconds at the desk to check out. Our luggage was stored free of charge for us to collect later in the day, which took only minutes though they told us to allow 15min.I know where we'll be staying next time we return to New York City... in fact I wonder if they have rooms free for our first wedding anniversary?!

<Content>Comfortable, Clean and excellent Concierge Service At first I was hesitant to stay so far Downtown, away from where all the action is, but half a block away you have subway station, TrainR-that takes you anywhere you want to go. This is definetally a palce to stay if you want to get away from the noise and hussle of the city when it's time to retire. Being right across the street from ground zero, the msot people you see at night are the curious tourits.The only negative feature of this hotel is that at night most of the restaurants in the area, other than the one at the hotel itself, are closed. The rooms were excellent with a plasma television in the room and a daily newspaper at your door every morning. Will definetally return

<Content>Location isn't everything Great expectations, enormous let down. Reserved a king room with city view, but was told it was no guarantee (???) so ended up with small queen room and limited side view. Thin walls; heard elevator run constantly (all day  night)! Staff was friendly, but not helpful. Stayed 4 nights; Luckily I viewed my account instead of using the express checkout. I was overcharged by $1,000 plus charged for minibar drink never taken. Was not allowed access to submit online hotel comments. Overall, this hotel was overpriced for its lack of amenities. I stayed for its location since it was a business trip. Only good thing was the complimentary breakfast offered to me after I complained.

<Content>good hotel...but noisy elevators ! I stayed one night in June. Rooms are OK, with very nice flat screen Televisions. Swimming pool and business center were great with friendly and helpfull staff. Could also not complain about the quality of breakfast. But the worst is the noise of the elevators. I you wish to stay there, do not forget to ask for a room FAR AWAY from the elevators. I will not come back to the Millenium just because of that.

<Content>Nothing Spectacular Chosen as a weekend getaway 'downtown' - building looks great - clean and functional. 30 mins wait to check in mostly because there were only 2 Receptionists. Room was on-par for US$179 a night - love the plasma TV in the room - clean lines and neutrogena amenities in the bathroom.Charged for mini-bar items that weren't touched..(someone checked it whilst we were out at 1030pm?!) One of the few hotels in NYC to have a pool - basic gym. Basically a nice little change of scenery from 'uptown'.

<Content>Too many problems along the way.... Stayed here 2 nights. property is not too bad, stayed in the room with squeaky pipes. not a pleasant thing to be woken up at 6 AM to the sound of pipes squealing cause someone above us was taking a hot shower.they also overcharged us (basically charged us twice - once on my husband's charge card, and for the same stay on mine and then denied it.) Very annoying. We Won't be staying here again.

<Content>Check In is Bad and Watch Your Credit Card Bill Hotel room was nice, but checking in was a nightmare. I had prepaid a NS room with 2 double beds, and they kept trying to get me to move to a 1 queen bed room. Room was not ready at check in time and when we got there, room had someone else's luggage in it. Last night of stay, received a wake up call at 5am that was not ordered and this was after the 2am fire alarm that went off. Also, now this hotel is trying to get me to pay more money and I had it prepaid through Hilton. The staff is totally unorganized.

<Content>Excellent place to stay My wife and I stayed three nights at the Millenium Hilton after reading numerous favorable reviews. The hotel exceeded our expectations. The staff was efficient and friendly from arrival to departure. Our King/NS room (53rd floor) was very clean and well appointed and exactly what we reserved. We were able to view the Brooklyn Bridge and Statue of Liberty. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and ordered from room service (very fast service). The lobby bar was a nice place to relax in the evening and watch TV. My only criticism was that the elevators could be heard from our corner room. Though not loud enough to move to another room.

<Content>Excellent Hotel. We stayed here for one night, and got the rate through Priceline. The reservation was perfect, non-smoking with King size bed. The room was in excellent condition, very confortable bed, and VERY clean. Everything seemed new. Awesome view (but sad to see Ground zero). I have stayed in several 4-5 star New York hotels and this is one of the best so far. Yes, it is far south, but we would be taking the subway anyway, since we like to see many things in NY, so it doesn't bother us a bit. The service of this hotel was excellent from doormen, luggage guys, etc.. Our only complaint was that at the time of getting our car back from the vaket parking, we waited about 45 minutes (we were told to wait about 25 minutes); when we asked about our car, we were told that it was right next door's parking lot, and it only took then 5 minutes to find/bring the car, so they could have done this the first time we asked for the car.

<Content>probably the best value in NY Just returned from my second stay here and am in love with this hotel. Where else in NY can one get such a super view (43rd floor) and really amazingly comfortable bed for under $140 for a night. The rooms are modern and tasteful with marble bathrooms (shower is not too powerful though). Location is fine if one is a fan of local transport (we are), otherwise it could get very expensive by cab. It is however a haven to return to in the evening after the hust麓le and bustle of Midtown. Room service is surprisingly affordable with a comprehensive menu and very quick service. Breakfast is pricey however Starbucks is just around the corner and there are also plenty of deli's in the area. I highly recommend this hotel and know where I will be staying on my next visit to NY.

<Content>Just Average This was my first time back to the Millenium Hilton since September 11 had forced its closure. I had stayed in the hotel 4 or more times previous to 2001 and had always been a huge fan of the place- it was sleek, contemporary and well run. This time however, I wasn't as happy. Don't get me wrong- it's not awful, but the service was lacklustre in several areas and the place just seemed less luxurious- certainly it is not in my opnion a 4 star-more like a 3 star.Like other reviewers we encountered problems upon arrival with regards to the room booked. We had booked a Deluxe double on 33-55th floor with city view and on previous visits this had meant a corner room with a view uptown. The view we had was directly over Ground Zero. I don't particularly have a problem with that but certainly I would not call it a city view- unless they are referring to a New jersey city view. To be honest I couldnt be bothered to argue further with the clerk but as per other reviews- don't expect to necessarily get what you have booked! The check in staff were bordering on the surly and they even stated that breakfast wasnt included in the rate which I immediately corrected them on. We were told the breakfast vouchers would be sent to our room later that day and after 2 further inquiries and telephone calls- they were- hardly 4 star service huh?One further problem with the room is that we were on a non smoking floor. On our return to our room on the Saturday we could smell a strong cigarette smell in our room- which had a connecting door to teh room next door- we could smell teh smoke seeping through- and as non smokers it wasn't pleasant particularly as the hotel has very small windows that dont clear the air and air conditioning doesnt really help with smoke. We called the front desk who seemed totally disinterested and it was only when i got angry that he sent us housekeeping with an air purifier which took up a large chunk of our bedroom floorspace and wasnt that efficient- they seemed unconcerned that other guests were smoking on a non smoking floor which I think is unacceptable. Again they seemed disinterested and I was made to feel as if I was making a fuss!Housekeeping werent very efficient either- granted they tidied the room but it still looked messy- ie they didnt put away teh ironing board and the extra pillows and blankets were just left folded on the bed so the overall impression was a bit tatty.Now the good bits- the swimming pool is fab and the staff there are friendly and cheerful. Breakfast is good if you can get it as part of your room rate but overpriced otherwise. Room service is overpriced in my view and dont touch the minibar- $4.50 for a can of coke-! there are loads of delis nearby where we stocked up on beverages and stuffed them in our ice bucket to chill- much better!The rooms themselves may have been refurbished but the carpets look cheap and the place just seems more like a holiday inn than a premium Hilton property. The plasma screen TVs are Ok but they take the place of large mirrors that used to be wall mounted. Now the only mirrors are in the bathroom and on the bathroom door in a dark spot in the room. The bar in the lobby is quite nice but expensive- $12.50 for a cocktail seems a bit cheeky when it is really only a standard lobby bar.We stayed at Embassy Suites which is across from the Millenium by the Financial Center and this is a much better option if you can get a good rate.

<Content>Great view, location, sights and more... I've been to New York before but stayed in the Times Square area. A lot of hustle and bustle but it was fun. This time I wanted to try a different area of New York, this is why I chose the Millenium Hilton. It's right across the street from Ground Zero, next door to Century 21 (great discount shopping), and about a ten minute walk to Battery Park which is where you grab the ferry to Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty, but there is much more to see at the Park than one would think. Just make sure you check to see if anything is going on at the Park the days you are going. There were some really good bands playing the day we went, but you needed to get tickets ahead of time. St. Paul's Chapel is right next door, built in 1700's and host to George Washington's Inaugeration, very historic and almost no damage from 9/11. If we would have known about that earlier we would have gone (we had only one day there). The rooms were very modern, the view overlooked all of Ground Zero. Bathrooms were large. Not many restaurants in the area so we ate at the hotel restaurant, Church and Dey. Very good. If you do want to go see Times Square or Central Park, the subway is right in front of the hotel. Very easy access. All in all, safe location, great hotel and lots of sights. Will stay there again when I go back to Lower Manhattan.

<Content>Fantastic but not without flaws I just returned from a wonderful stay at the Millenium Hilton and selected this hotel based on reviews I read on TripAdvisor.com. My experience mirrored others I read here. Because of these problems, I cannot give this hotel a five star rating. If these problems didn't occur, it would get top ratings. Okay... now for the problems: I booked a king smoking room city view from the Hilton Website and received immediate confirmation of my reservation. (鈥淐ity view鈥?means between the 30th and 55th floor of the 55-story building.) When I arrived, they told me they have a double smoking room reserved for us. After telling them that鈥檚 not acceptable, they switched it to a king non-smoking room and explained when reserving a room the exact room type that you reserve is not guaranteed; it's based on availability during check in. This is something to keep in mind for those who are booking a room. Even if you pay ahead, you could get bumped into a lesser room. So, I accepted the king non-smoking room. After they made the switch they told us the room wasn't ready. Check-in is at 3pm; we arrived at 3:30pm. An hour later at 4:30pm, finally we were told we could have the room, but there's one problem--they don't have keys for us. The device that encodes the key cards wasn鈥檛 working. The bellhop brought our bags up and let us in our room on the 37th floor. We left for an evening out on the town and returned at about 11:30pm. The front desk gave us our key cards and when we got to the room they didn't work. Went down to the front desk. They gave us another set of key cards. Went back to the room to find they still didn't work. Called the front desk from the 37th floor phone and they transferred me to security who said they would send someone right over. My girlfriend went to the bathroom on the third floor and I stood by the door for over 10 minutes and no one arrived. Finally my girlfriend returned with a security person who IDed me and then called the front desk. Seems my girlfriend bumped into him in the stairwell and he wasn't dispatched based on my call. The front desk confirmed my reservation so he called security to find after 15 minutes no one was sent to help me. He apologized and proceeded to let us in the room. One problem... his key card didn't work either. Finally he got a master key card and was able to let us in the room. We never did get key cards that worked and, as a result, were never able to both leave the room for the remainder of our visit without having to rely on the unreliable security department to eventually arrive, ID us, make phone calls and maybe get into the room. So, the negative is the hotel has some problems with the operational aspects of handling reservations. I will say that every person I dealt with regarding these problems was very polite and apologetic, even when I pushed a bit, expressing annoyance, which, in part, was an act to get the person to 鈥渉op to it鈥?and correct the problem. Okay鈥?enough of the negatives and onto the positives. I鈥檝e stayed in New York a number of times and always seek out different hotels, looking for the best stay for the best price. I have to say, the Millenium Hilton is by far the best hotel deal I can find. The accommodations and amenities are absolutely top shelf! When the World Trade Center collapsed, it totaled the Millenium Hilton. No one in the hotel at the time was killed, but the hotel was shutdown for 18 months, completely gutted and rebuilt. It re-opened in May of 2003 as the only AAA four-star hotel in the business district. Each room has a Zenith high definition 42鈥?plasma flat-screen television that is amazing! The marble bathrooms are spacious. The mattress is very fluffy and comfortable. The view out the window is breathtaking, even though the king rooms stare out over Ground Zero, which is directly across the street; something to consider before booking a room. Those bothered by this view, be forewarned. It鈥檚 one of the best views in the city for this one block graveyard, and at the time of this writing, adjacent buildings are gutted and being rebuilt due to extensive damage. Amongst the gorgeous view is a vacant six-story, one block hole with stuff in it, like ramps, trailers, vehicles, a few buildings, and other ancillary curiosities. Other than that, the city view king room overlooks the Hudson River and the majestic west-side skyline, which is beautiful. After getting in our room on Saturday night, I just sat by the window and stared for probably 45 minutes at the view during a lightning storm. Beautiful! The hotel has two bars: one in the lobby and one on the third floor. I never saw the third floor bar but the one in the lobby was nice. Other reviews cover different hotel features so I won鈥檛 get into them here, but I do want to mention what others have stated about the neighborhood. It鈥檚 an excellent area to explore. Unlike other areas in Midtown, such as the Murray Hill district, which is primarily residential, this area of the Battery is loaded with shops and delis. It was a lot of fun to just walk and explore. It felt very safe and people were quite social and friendly. I wondered if the September 11th disaster had a part in this, perhaps changing some cultural aspect of the area. You know how people pull together during disasters. Well, this area spent the last two and a half years cleaning up after the disaster and healing emotional and financial wounds. Mind you, it鈥檚 still New York City鈥?don鈥檛 expect everyone to be polite and act like your best friend, but there was an openness I haven鈥檛 experienced in New York. The Battery is a bit out of the way from Midtown, but its location is close to Little Italy, Chinatown, and Greenwich Village. We enjoyed it so much we鈥檝e decided to stay at this hotel during our next visit. If you take a cab to midtown, expect it to cost between $12 and $15, not including tip. We found it wasn鈥檛 hard to find someone to share a cab and split the cost. People stand in front of the hotel looking for a cab to get up town. So, I recommend this hotel with a caution about your reservation and the hotel dealing with logistical aspects of your stay. If you skate through without problems in this area, I think you鈥檙e going to be real pleased with your stay!

<Content>So wonderful! I was so impressed with this hotel! Everyone was really friendly, the rooms were immaculately clean and beautiful! Rooms had huge towels (at least on the first night), bathrooms had granite countertops and marble floors. A request for two beds was happily met and we were surprised to see two European-style twin beds in the room. Beds were super-comfy, we had a corner room with a great view (but no plasma tv -- ok because who comes to NYC to watch tv anyway?) Concierges were very helpful with subway information, calling restaurants to make reservations, etc. Highly recommend! One note: If you are coming to this hotel from the Newark airport, DO NOT take super shuttle. It took TWO HOURS to get here from there. Driver had to drop off EIGHT OTHER PEOPLE before me and the van's a/c was broken and it was sweltering hot.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Just spent 3 nights in the Millenium Hilton 23rd-26th April, what a fantastic hotel and great value for money.After reading all the reviews about the Millenium Hilton on this website I decided to book 3 nights for my girlfriend and I through the Hilton website. We managed to get a city view room on the 41st floor including breakfast for 拢93 per night. We booked this about a month in advance and if you do your homework like I did that is a very good price for a 4* hotel bb in NYC.The room was modern and spacious with great plasma tv, internet, cd player, pay per view movies and floor to ceiling windows with an excellent view of the New York skyline and directly overlooking World Trade Centre site.The hotel is situated in downtown Manhattan so you do have to get the subway or taxis to most of the sites and attractions, but for me this was'nt a problem at all. The subway station is right outside the hotel ($2 for one trip or $10 for 7 trips) and I never spent more than $8.00 on a taxi from the hotel. Still loads to do close to the hotel anyway. The fantastic Century 21 dept store is next door, Wall St around the corner, Ground Zero opposite, Statue of Liberty, Chinatown, and Soho only 5 minutes away.All in all a great hotel, great value and friendly informative staff made this hotel a great place to stay and I'd definatley stay again.

<Content>Rocky start, smooth ending Because I booked through Priceline I had great difficulty in having my request for a two bedded room honored. I didn't need the extra aggravation. After e-mailing a complaint to the Hilton website, and following more than 4 phone calls to the hotel itself one very nice gentleman assured me there would be no problem accomodating my request. If Hilton does not want to do business with Priceline, why do they?? After booking, I feel Hilton's relationship is with the consumer without regard to how a reservation is made. Anyway, the stay was wonderful, the room immaculate, the service superb and friendly. I would not hesitate to stay again and I probably will. I had concerns about staying so close to the site of such devastation, but seeing the renewal of the area was heartening.

<Content>Dreamy... I stayed here March 25 - 29 2004. Guys, this hotel is fabulous. A huge, imposing dark, glassy building, with about 50 odd floors. The lobby is quite impressive, and the staff (receptionists, concierge etc) are helpful, well informed and well trained!Word of warning!! I booked through ebookers for this hotel and paid ebookers in advance. But they did not pay the Hilton the money - and ladies on the reception were insistent that I pay them. I argued that their argument was with ebookers but they were having none of it. Anyway, am in the process of claiming back my money from ebookers, but that is something to note - even though you may have paid your travel agent directly so strictly speaking your contract may not be with the Hilton directly they will hold you accountable for any outstanding charge. Between you and me, without going into too much detail, the whole debacle has surprisingly worked out very favourably for me in the end (wink).You should also be aware that the hotel directly overlooks Ground Zero. As you exit the building, World Trade Centre's empty carcass is the first thing you see. Moreover, when you look out the window, you get an aerial view of the site. I must say, it didnt really affect me until I stopped to really think about it, but more sensitive individuals might be put off.The standard rooms are very modern, stylish and spacious, with high ceilings and beautiful soft furnishings. A huge plasma TV screen is positioned directly opposite your bed. A CD player is available (although I didnt use mine). Huge, comfortable bed. Pay per view with a good range of movies, TV shows, games, and access to the internet and email. NB NO MTV tho - I thought this was odd. They have VH1 instead. Not sure why this is.My only other gripe is that you cannot remove their items, nor can you put your own items into the refridgerators. The fridge - allegedly - creates an automatic charge on your account when you remove or put anything in - so avoid this where possible. The hotels drinks and snacks are, unsurprisingly, pricey.The bathroom was elegant and again, spacious, black marble surfaces, ceramic tiled floor. Shower was nice enough - nice toiletries etc. Everywhere is immaculately clean as you would expect with the Hilton - the corridors are furnished with bright cream and yellows.Sorry, one more gripe...the gym was a bit disappointing as it didnt have a wide enough range of machines in my opinion, but it was adequate. The hotel also has a pool - I never tried it but it looked nice enough.Its in downtown Manhattan, and the hotel backs right onto Broadway where there are a wide choice of shops and boutiques for your delectation - although you do have to take the bus or subway to get there. The subway station is literally right outside! Perfect!I ate at the restaurant just once because I found a lovely deli where the food was much cheaper and more to my liking - there are lots of such delis all along broadway - I would add that the decor in some of these places could be better - but dont miss them out or you might miss all the lovely cuisine!I paid about $650 (脗拢358 approx) for 4 nights here. A little more than I would usually spend. But would I stay here again? Definitely. Was worth every penny!

<Content>Good room, excellent location Staff is indifferent here. Got a lot of attitude for using priceline during check-in, even though I am a Gold level Hhonors member, I was completely chastized on the level of being screamed at. Don't know what the deal was but treatment like this is completely unprofessional. Came to my room and it felt like 90 degrees. A phone call gave me instructions to open my window to cool off the room. Good advice, except I was given an 8th floor room and street traffic noise fronting the WTC site can be attrocious with the window open -- with windows closed it is however SILENT, amazing. Fortunately the bell hops were very nice and efficient. Room service was great too, superb menu selection and prices were strangely not as shocking as I thought it would be (I've stayed at other Hiltons in cheap cities where room service was a whole deal more) so I ordered quite a few times. Meals were excellent and the food came up lightning fast, averaging only 15-20 minutes! Room was clean but strangely showing some age considering this hotel was completely renovated after 9/11. Hotel practically hugs several subway lines so public transportation is literally within footsteps of the lobby. That alone is worth it to me since I really like the subway system. Be warned however that the subway system service is really bad during off-hours on Sat and Sunday. I had to wait nearly an hour for a train to come by to get me back to lower manhattan at 1am. All in all, the $105 I paid was well worth the money.

<Content>A Great hotel A great hotel, has undergone a major renovation since sustaining significant damage on 9/11. Rooms have awesome Plasma TV's, extremely comfortable beds. Right next to numerous subway lines and the PATH station. We were upgraded to a junior suite which was extrmely nice. Restaurant is a bit expensive (Hilton Gold  Diamond members receive a full complimentary American breakfast which was listed in menu for almost $20, but the breakfast was not bad). Lobby is nice, although small. I will absolutely be staying here again!

<Content>A great stay awaits! I stayed at the Millenium Hilton over the Labor Day 2003 holiday. Except for a few billing errors that were promptly taken care of, everything about our stay was flawless.Our room was spacious and comfortable. The view overlooking the World Trade Center site was breathtaking and somber. People pass by the site all hours of the night. A highlight of our stay was enjoying watching the awesome plasma TVs after a long day of activity.I highly recommend this hotel. Hilton has spent a fortune sprucing this place up after 9/11 and it shows.The staff was wonderful--very friendly and without a big city uber-attitude.

<Content>love Got the hotel at a great price of $135.00. Right across the street from what was the twin towers. The room was great, 42 inch plasma t.v. You can get a metrocard for $7 and ride all day. The train takes you straight to times square all the way to 5th ave. Now the part of the review you won't get. Don't eat out of the stocked fridge because its not free. As soon as you lift an item its connected to an sensor an automactly billed to your room. And its not cheap. Valet parking is $45.00 a day, which you will need cause traffic is hectic, so a cab or subway is your best bet to get around. Also $75.00 a day for mis. items. ---

<Content>Great, but watch out! On arrival checking in was made very fast. However do take time to read the terms before checking in. $170 was held on my card as a deposit which staff said nothing about.We were on the 41st floor where the view was great. Ground Zero was directly across from our room but be advised this view is not for everyone it was very sad to look at sometimes.The huge bed, 42inch plasma screen, mini bar, CD player and snacks were great but dont hang around the restaurant for to long the prices are very expensive. The hotel is the next street away from Broadway so theres many shops and places to eat.Century21 across the road is a nice store for cheap designer clothes. About a five minute walk away is also a big cinema. All in all its a great hotel with a great location and I will return.

<Content>Incredible Stay! My boyfriend and I stayed there one night just after Christmas. The room was beautiful. Mind you I am used to budget hotels, but this one did exceed our expectations. We had a room on the next to the top floor with a wonderful view of Ground Zero. The staff was friendly. Only slightly annoyed with having to show ID everytime we entered the hotel, but it was a necessary evil considering the times. I would highly recommend this hotel. My boyfriend COULD NOT get over the TV. You know guys. Plasma TVs in everyroom. And big ones at that. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. The entire stay was BEAUTIFUL.

<Content>Stellar! We LOVED the Millenium Hilton on our first overnight trip to NYC! We found a last minute deal on the hilton website - $152.10 for a city view (floors 31-54) room with two double beds on the 31st floor. Our only minor quibble was that the double rooms are on the sides of the building, so you only get a peripheral view of ground zero and the hudson. However, staring at that big, gaping hole for too long can be a little much to take...Anyway, other than a rather snippy front desk staff (I figured they must put up with a lot of !@#% from people) and overpriced parking ($45 a day?), the place was stellar. Location was king, flat-panel plasma TV a cool perk, desk chair very comfortable, large very clean bathroom, and I slept like a baby in their wonderful beds - second runner up to Westin's Heavenly Bed! TIP: If you need two double beds, request the north side of the hotel, facing midtown manhattan. The rooms above the 40th floor have a view you could gaze at for hours on end, especially at night. The rooms facing ground zero have king beds and are rather small, and the suites are in the corners of the building. If you can find a rate of under $350 for a corner junior suite, it's one of the best values in New York. We plan to return here in May for a concert - can't wait! See you there!

<Content>Faultless... First trip to NYC. Met by doorman and checked-in swiftly for my 3 night stay. Offered a choice of 3 floors and picked the highest!! all staff very friendly and professional, bell-hop escorted me to my room on the 54th floor and explained the features, thought provoking view of ground zero and beyond to the Hudson and New Jersey. Very comfortable room with new fixtures and fittings and the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. The location of the hotel suited me, subway just outside hotel, so easy to get around. Plenty of dining options close by, including a 24hr deli and a starbucks next door. Bar staff friendly and knowledgable, the only negative was that my travel agent had not passed on my pre-payment, but that was not the Hotels fault!!!

<Content>Nice room, mediocre service Got the room on priceline for very reasonable rate--$95. Accomodation was fine, though service was definitely not 4 star. The concierge told us--with confidence--that TKTS booth was open at seaport on sundays. We walked to the TKTS booth and discovered it was closed, as it always is on Sundays! When we told concierge this, no apology, not even a perfunctory sorry. At check in, the clerk was rude and inattentive. Gave us a key that didn't work for the room. When we came downstairs with it, explained key didn't work, and she just snatched it from us, again, without even a sorry and asked someone to make us a new key. No bell hop offered to take up our bags. Didn't matter to us since we only were staying over one night. This just isn't behavior in keeping with a hotel that bills itself as 4 star. As for location, I think true tourists (we lived in NY until recently, and still commute there from a nearby suburb) should probably stay further uptown. Everything you really want to see is up there and night time it's dead in the area, unless you walk a few blocks up to Tribeca (which we did.)

<Content>Excellent rooms with loads of space We arrived to celebrate two birthdays and Valentines day, and had a ball. The hotel is handy for the Statue of Liberty, next door to a great value high quality clothes shop, has unique and fascinating views of Ground Zero and has a cool reception area. They made a special fuss for our daughters birthday, were very welcoming and efficient, and had great well equipped rooms.

<Content>Website problems! Great hotel, yes, but there were problems which were not addressed nor resolved.I originally booked for a great rate via the Hilton website. The website deal was very attractive as this was my first visit to the city. When I got to the hotel, my rate was change to full price because Hilton had a problem with the website and the clerk indicated that becuases hte hotel was now full, I could not receive the promotional rate. I provided proof of what I thought was my confirmation from the website but this was not accerptable to her.Upon checking out of hotel, I left a detailed message of my concern for hte manager. Never heard from him nor did I get a response or proper assistance from Hilton customer service because this hotel operates independently. Too bad for me.

<Content>A fabulous weekend I stayed in the Millenium Hilton in November 2003. My first were impressions were fantastic, the lobby of the hotel was very impressive indeed. Staff were helpful and friendly. The room was extremly comfortable and clean and looked out over the Ground Zero site which was actually strangely nice. It was quiet and in a good location because it was easy to get everywhere thnks to the subway. My stay in New York was fantastic, helped by the warm staff and lovely surrondings of this superb hotel. I would definatly stay there again. It was so nice to return to such a peaceful environment after walking around busy New York all day. I went over a weekend which probably made it quieter because nobody was at work. A good choice for your stay.

<Content>Excellent conclusion to fantastic vacation We decided to spend 3 nights in New York in January after completing a Caribbean cruise over Xmas and New Year. Got a great deal also on Hilton website. The hotel does overlook 'Ground Zero', but this did not bother us. Great views from the hotel (we were on the 52nd floor). Did order room service for breakfast one morning and it was good, and also had dinner in the restaurant one night and that was also good. Century 21 great and close for shopping. All hotel staff very helpful and the rooms were amazing. Will be staying here when we return to NY later in the year.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed her over Christmas for 2 nights - got a good deal on Hilton.com. Highly recommend the hotel - spotlessly clean rooms, not too small by NYC standards. Increased security around hotel, but not a problem. Staff very efficient and welcoming, nothing was too much trouble. If you don't mind being in Downtown, stay here for a fraction of the price of a midtown hotel.

<Content>Great hotel for honeymooners We just spent 10 glorious days in NYC for our honeymoon and stayed in the Hilton Millenium. Excellent and classy hotel! We definitely recommend for honeymoon couples- very romantic rooms with incredible views, especially on the north and northeast sides on the upper floors. All around service was outstanding, especially the housekeeping crew. Subway stations to anywhere are within a minute walk, and for those who are fans of Dunkin Donuts coffee, there are 3 only a block or 2 away! Will definitely stay here next time in NYC.

<Content>Incredible room and Incredible price...We love this place In the past 6 months, my husband and I have stayed in this hotel at least 4 times, and each time we love it more. This is one of the only places we like to stay. We also stayed here prior to September 11th, so it holds a special place in our heart. For those of you who can't handle the memories of 9-11, you probably shouldn't stay here since it is directly across the street. If you get a room in the front of the hotel you WILL be overlooking ground zero through your large hotel room window. As sad as it is for us, we actually feel a connection staying here so often. The hotel was actually damaged (the building is all glass) and many of the windows were shattered. It just reopened in May, 2003. All I can say is this must be the VERY BEST buy in NYC. Their are only a couple of things I can see someone complaining about. First, if you are only interested in staying somewhere that has tons to do around you, this isn't the place. It is located in the Wall St. Financial district which is kind of dull on the weekends. For us, that doesn't matter since it is very close to the Village and Soho and we also have our car with us and don't mind driving 10 minutes. You will find stores and restaurants, but it isn't hustle and bustle like you find in many other areas. THE ROOM. This room is great! For NYC I would say this is very big. It is decorated modern, extremely clean, nice bathrooms with marble and granite, the 2nd most Comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept on (the Westin has the heavenly bed which is a tiny bit better), and an AMAZING 42 plasma TV built into the wall right in front of your bed....It is truly incredible, and for the prices you can usually get a king room for, I can't imagine anything is better in NYC. (when we book on internet travel sights ie: hotels.com, orbitz.com, etc) we have gotten the king deluxe rooms for as low as 136.00 a night to 160.00 a night. The hotel staff are so friendly and the elevators are nice and fast. I can't speak for the food since we have never eaten here. You will really like this hotel.....I feel completely comfortable recommending it to anyone visiting NYC.

<Content>Superb hotel in NY My Fiance booked this hotel for our romantic weekend in NY. Fantastic hotel, only had one minor problem with the heating but they sorted that out promptly. Fabulous room, with huge plasma screen, great view from the 34th floor, lovely bathroom ... oh can't forget the bed! so comfortable and very homely feel to it. Hotel practically next door to Century 21 - great store, we were there almost every day! Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, can't wait to re-visit some time in the future.

<Content>Excellent Value Stayed at the beginning of December. Room represents excellent valuie. Location excellent as nearest subway has express trains going up both East and west-side of Manhatton. Also convenient for excellent Century 21 Store (next door)...for all those designer choices at bargain prices. Totally refurbished since 9/11...rooms have huge flat-screen plasma TVs. i have a Hilton Gold card so also got free breakfast. Would definately stay there next time I am in NY.

<Content>Enjoyed this hotel very much Stayed here on Friday, November 7. Had to wait for a room but the wait was worth it. Room was great even though it was booked through Priceline. (25th floor directly overlooking Ground Zero and the water beyond. ) I would recommend staying here in lieu of staying in Midtown. So many more interesting things to see and do in lower Manhattan. Hope to stay here again next time I'm in town.
