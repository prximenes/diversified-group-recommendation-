<Content>Will Return With The Tide! I have been staying at this property, which I know as the Honolulu Prince, and referring others, for 10 years. As a flight attendant, I visit Honolulu for pleasure very often. I have a great deal of experience evaluating hotels all over the world and I would not hesitate to stay here, were rooms available, on my next trip to Honolulu.It is now owned by Aqua, and is under needed renovation. It is apparently to be known as the Tides.Our room's renovation -- we were in 603 -- had been completed only three weeks before our visit, Dec. 23-28.Anyone considering booking here should be aware of the property's very convenient location and excellent, excellent value. If you stand with your back to the ocean, walk across the sand and across Kalakaua Avenue and all the way through the International Marketplace, you will come out within one block of the hotel, almost at the corner of Nahua and Kuhio. A pharmacy is around the corner, a dive shop and liquor store are across the street. Starbucks is next door. You are two blocks from the bus stop, the 24-hour Food Pantry, Denny's and Smorgy's, and three blocks from Keoni's (our favorite Thai restaurant in the world) and you are in the HEART of Waikiki.Our beds and linens were lovely. The air conditioner is mounted high on the wall but there is a remote to operate it. The switch beneath it need not be adjusted, even though it is in the down position. The TV is new and ultramodern. There was a microwave (we did not use it) and a refrigerator that we used a great deal. By removing two of the shelves, we were able to store extra-large bottles of soda.I wish that the TV remote was either designed to be wider on one end than the other, or else had a glow-in-the-dark label on one end. That way I would not discover that the reason it wasn't serving to change the channel or volume was that I was basically aiming it at myself! There is no pool, but I believe you are welcome to enjoy the pool at one of the very nearby Aqua properties.This is a budget facility and doesn't pretend to be otherwise; the website is honest about this. This is for a familymoon, and ideal for a girlfriend getaway -- not a honeymoon or luxury retreat. I witnessed a woman -- hardly dressed for even a mid-priced hotel stay, much less for a luxury hotel property -- complaining about the accommodations. There is no reason for complaint if you realize that, most of the time, you get what you pay for. In the case of the Honolulu Prince -- oops, I mean, The Tides -- you get more than what you pay for.In particular, Mr. Lyman and Mike (whose last name I did not note) offer more personal attention and service than I've received from personnel at much more expensive properties. When an island-wide power outage struck the island on the evening of Dec. 26, the front desk was equipped with lanterns and fun little glowsticks to see us to our rooms! They were both WONDERFUL and professional; as I watched their interactions with other guests, I was struck by their poise and patience. Mike very graciously stored our (too many) bags on our last day after check-out so that we could enjoy the afternoon in Waikiki before our early-evening flight.We enjoyed the newspaper delivered every morning to our door.A neighbor of the hotel is an apartment building which advertises on its front window that it is pet-friendly. Its residents, however, are not friendly with their neighbor, The Tides. At one point we were leaving the hotel when we came upon a young man walking two or three dogs. They were busy defecating on the sidewalk directly in front of the hotel, even though a patch of grass was available. We had to walk around them. On our return a few minutes later it was clear that the young man did not feel it was necessary to clean up after his animals. I find this to be the heighth of rudeness; were I to be responsible for renovating such a property, I would find it difficult to maintain my enthusiasm for the project if my neighbors could show my efforts, and my guests, no more respect than this. The apartment building's management MUST be contacted.Suggestions: A small bottle of water per guest in the room would be a wonderful welcome after a long flight. If that can't be done within your price point, have bottled water for sale at the front desk. (Perhaps your lobby's renovation might plan for space for a refrigerator or reach-in cooler.) An in-room coffeepot with one complimentary package of coffee would be great, since coffee is not offered in the lobby. Additional packages of coffee might provide a small revenue stream and save your budget-minded guests some money, given the price of coffee at the nearby Starbucks. Just don't put the coffeepot in the bath, please!Our housekeeping was perfectly adequate. A couple of days we sent the maid away after only taking fresh towels. We saw no mold and no bugs (although both are entirely predictable, even with the most fastidious housekeeping, in the South Pacific).I remember suggesting to the previous owners that an ice machine would be a handy amenity, particularly since a liquor store is across the street. I believe that the plumbing contractor is cheating the property's owners. Our new sink was slow to drain. Our new toilet handle had to be held down during the entire flush for the flush to be completed. The new shower handle came off in our hands several times.When the property was owned by Aston/Resortquest there were coin-operated laundry machines on site. For those staying longer, traveling with children, or hoping to pack extra-light, these are very handy. I do not know if these are still available, but, if not, I hope they will be.Double-glazed windows would cut down on noise. However, most tourists have come from the mainland and awaken very early anyway. Much of the noise may have been from holiday fireworks and renovation. Presumably that will end at some point. P.S. Future guests: Ask Mike to tell you his story about the guy who checked in with two wives. Hysterical!

<Content>Think Twice before sytaying here - money isn't everything A family of six we booked this room because there are very few in Waikiki that could accommodate us all. It also had a full kitchen. The highlight was that the air conditioning worked, and the day they vacuumed the carpets. I know they are renovating, but how do you renovate poor service. The tradesmen working there were more friendly than the staff. We told them many times how many people were coming, but we still ran out of cutlery and towels, we even purchased our own spatula. We disinfected the kitchen prior to use, it was filthy. When you have to constantly ask for clean linen, toilets to be cleaned etc...Looking for an investment try this place, it can only get better. Not to mention the unsavoury characters staying there, Oh and dont bother watching COPS on TV, just sit on the balcony and wait for the action. The good points close to the main beach 2 1/2 blocks close to shops etc and transport.You will see a lot of Waikiki because you wont want to stay in the room.Travelling with a family i would not return here, try castle ocean resort, we stayed there last time and it was good. Good luck AHP.

<Content>home style feeling We stayed at the Aqua Honolulu Prince from Dec.10-26, and we loved it! The accomdations were a little worn, but renovations were going on while we were there, so I imagine it will get even better next time we see it. We had a clean room, and for my family that was important, especially with a 1 year old granddaughter around. The 2 bedrooms  spacious bathroom was a definite plus! We all slept comfortably. The kitchen could have used another pot or pan, but other than that everything was good. The desk help  cleaning staff were friendly. I did see some negative comments posted from others, but I never saw anything that would lead me to believe anything they said was out of place. The parking was fine, and we had a express van too, so we didn't experience any parking wars of any sort. We felt very relaxed, like it was home away from home feeling after the first week. The mid-Waikiki location was a big plus too! We didn't hear much downtown noise at nights either. I'd stay there again  the price was right. I did the Honolulu Marathon, so I enjoyed having to relax after the race and recuperated w/o any problems. Chester M.  family from Alaska : )

<Content>3 great weeks We have just returned from 3 weeks in Nov/Dec and would go back like a shot, given the chance. We had looked the place up on the net before going so knew what to expect with renovations etc going on. The negative reviews from some travellers were a bit daunting but we found them totally unfounded. The room was immaculate and cleaned every day, with no sign of the mould, stained linen, bedbugs or any of the other things others had complained about. The staff was excellent. Granted to decor was a bit dated and steps up to the bath and toilet was a bit strange, but it added to the character of the place. Who wants to go thousands of miles to stay in a place that's like every other motel room you have ever been in? We were able to see some of the newly renovated rooms and they are great with all new appliances including air conditioning, flat screen TV fridge, coffee maker and even a microwave in the standard room.The photos on the website hardly do it justice. We would definitely go back again and reccommend it to any who asks.Satisfied Aussies

<Content>Great value for money hotel Yes, the other reviews have said the hotel is a little run-down. Yes it is. If you are a budget traveller then this hotel is the place to be, you cannot expect 5-star suites. The hotel was neat, tidy and all you would need for a few nights in Honolulu. As you walked into the lobby you could see there were renovations in progress because there were often workmen there during daylight hours. Get in quick and book your accommodation before the prices for the room doubles when the renovations are complete.The staff were all helpful and responded to requests promptly. One day our shower was not draining properly and within 5 minutes there was a maintenance person up to our room and the issue was fixed quickly.Simple, cheap  clean accommodation. I would not choose this hotel for a luxurious Honolulu getaway but for a few nights, particularly between island hops, it is suitable.

<Content>downright raunchy filthy grimy unresponsive braindead staff upon arrival there was the odor of urine in the elevator, cut frayed carpet trip hazard and the lobby was furniture was slip covered with soiled stain covered fabric and the carpet was old and stained, i felt like i was in a insane asylum where the patients were the stqaff and they were bust regurgitating on the furniture and carpets. upon getting to my room i notiuced the ceinling leaking and they would not move me , so the water leaked all night to the rooms below the 10th floor. i sked for room service and was told they would do a light service, but after three requests sent a little old man to make the beds without changing the sheets after one week. this hotel is the saddest excuse for accomodations i have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. we moved out the next day. in expedias defense i must say they forced them to refund most of the monie wasted there. but the hassel and overlap time to the new hotel cost me time and misery. these idiots would be better off in the restaurant grease buisness.

<Content>Like in a horror movie The moment I stepped in the hotel 鈥渓obby鈥?I thought it was a joke. This place can鈥檛 be called a hotel. It looked like a place was either under condemnation or complete remodeling. But one would think that they would not be allowed to actually call it a hotel and rent out rooms. When I stepped into elevator I was starting to fear what I was going to see as my room. On 18th floor, most of the room鈥檚 doors were open with everything inside ripped off. In the middle of this was my room. When opened the door, I was actually horrified what I saw. Just one detail- the door to the balcony was nailed shut and everything looked like it was some dorm room that has not been touched since 60s. My family, that stayed at the different hotel has arrived to see it and did not allow me to stay at this place. I spent a night at their hotel and moved to another one next day. I wish I had taken photos.

<Content>Call for help and they'll do it in the morning? I get that i paid $70 for my room, but no one should have to go through this! I expressed my complaints about my air conditoner not working to the little front desk girl at about 5:15 pm in the afternoon the very day I checked in. Her name was Sharon who looked stressed, for there were other people complaining that same day and the hotel was sold out. I waited for 3 hours and no one came up and by now my room was an oven. When I got downstairs and told her no one came up, she looked at me surprised and said the maintenance lady was supposed to have come up already. I told her to please call again and so she did right in front of me and Sharon is told by maintenance to tell me to wait until the morning. I don't know how it works for cheap hotels, but this is unacceptable for any paying guest. I asked for a refund and they (Sharon) tells me I've been in the room this whole time and will be charged for the 1 nite. Needless to say, I still left and never went back. I don't believe any of these reviews that are being put for this hotel. For all we know these could be them putting positive reviews on themselves.

<Content>Love this hotel and it's staff! I stayed in this hotel for 15 days in September and I'm pretty shocked by the negative reviews it has been given! The hotel is by no means a luxury hotel, but my 2 weeks there was pretty perfect. My room was spotless, it could have used a face lift (the hotel is doing renovations right now) but it was clean and comfortable.The staff was amazing, Mike, Sharon, Harry, Isao, and others made my stay so much more amazing. They were fun to talk to, very helpful and kind. I was sad to leave!Whenever I needed something, I was able to call downstairs and someone responded to my needs within minutes. The hotel is in a PERFECT location for everything. You're a few seconds walk to Kuhio which is a major street for TheBus, a great, and inexpensive way to see Oahu. You're 2 blocks from the beach, one block from a grocery store and within walking distance of probably hundreds of shops in Waikiki. The bar next door did not interfere with my stay one time. The only time you even notice it's there is walking past, and the patrons tend to stay inside the bar.Waikiki gets very quiet at night, there are some local clubs/bars that are open but I was in most nights by around 9 or 10, since most things are closed by then.There were a couple of disturbances from a couple of the people who stayed in the room next door (there were many guests in that room during my stay) but they were taken care of immediately. One group of tourists were asked to leave because they were disturbing many guests in the middle of the night.I just can't wait until I can come back!

<Content>Samoan Mike - Yapese Cilla My family own a hotel and I know how hard it is to do upkeep, supplies managment, operations, budget, forcasts, marketing, customer service, houskeeping, etc.... Stayed at the Ohana West my last visit and this time my company booked me at the Aqua Honolulu Prince. I must tell you, the staff especially Mike, Cila, and Eshau the Kosrean guy were very helpful. The housekeeping staff and maintance staff were very helpful. I took it on myself to visit the renovation rooms with a crew that were wondering what was I doing, I acted as the inspector general, and they are doing a great job. After all the work they are doing, the Honolulu Prince will be the place to stay. My room was great though I can tell it's a bit old, I know after the renovations, it'll be the bomb.

<Content>Cockaroach Nest + Extremely Dirty  This is by far the WORST hotel I have ever been to. I am truly disappointed with the AquaResorts. I have been to many of their hotels before: Aqua Waikiki Wave, Aqua Bamboo, Equus, Aqua Aloha Surf  Spa, and Aqua Palms  Spa. I have never been unsatisfied with AquaResorts and their hotels until now.The CONS:1) Elevator was in extremely bad condition2) Walkways had paint chipping EVERYWHERE3) Room smelled of cigarettes (non-smoking room)4) VERY LARGE ROACH (alive) in corner of bathtub5) Roaches in sink when I first arrived6) Bird droppings all over balcony7) Carpet had MANY MANY stains (didn't dare to walk with bare feet)8) Walls had paint chipping9) Bathtub drain was very corroded10) Small roaches found in closetThe PROS:1) The room was definately spacious and the balcony was large.2) Air Conditioner was strong.I tried to stay the night but after sleeping on the bed for 2 hours I woke up extremely itchy and I didn't dare take a shower in the tub as the HUGE ROACH was still there in the corner (alive). I ended up just LEAVING in the middle of the night because I couldn't bare it.

<Content>Isao was great! Had a great time. Hotel staff very friendly, particularly Isao at the front desk. He went out of his way to make us feel welcome and had lots of good suggestions and recommendations. He greatly contributed to the enjoyment of our stay and hope he gets the recognition that he deserves for his extra efforts. Hotel has excellent location. Look forward to our next visit. Thanks again to Isao.

<Content>Not a 4-star resort, but great service. Okay first of all, this is not the cleanest and far from a luxury hotel. This was my second time in Honolulu, HI and arrived with my family to include a total of 4 adults and a 2 year old. Needed a 2 bedroom suite, with a Kitchen. Upon arrival, check in was a breeze front desk attendent, Isao, was great. (Isao...Sorry bud, not sure about the spellng).The hotel is under major construction, as it looks like it had not been upgrated since the late 1970's. The first room we entered had a few creepy crawlers running for cover when we opened the door. I brought this issue to the attention of Isao, who quickly moved us to a different room and was extremely appoligetic and accomidating.Over the next few days, I had a few problems with the TV, parking and other ares....all were taken care of quickly by the hotel staff.The stay was nice and worked out great for us. Everything is within walking distance (Outdoor market across the street), beach is 2 blocks away and the night life is close by. The staff here from the desk clerk to the room maid were polite, quick and responsive to our needs. But again, If you're looking for a 4 star rating, this is not the place.I can't wait to stay here again once all the rooms are upgrated....but of course I'm sure the prices will increase.THINGS DIDN'T LIKE: Parking is very limited, no ice machines, hardly any cookware (Skillets, pots, utensiles) for the kitchens, and EXTREME NEED OF UPGRADES (Floors, carpets, kitchens, bathrooms, beds, paint, Lani's...everything)...which is happening as I write this.

<Content>"DISGUSTING" and "BEWARE" After an exhausting flight we were excited to go to our hotel and res. When we arrived to the aqua honolulu prince it was not what we expected. The shuttle bus dropped us off and there was a loud bar right next door. I already knew we were in trouble. We checked in staff was friendly, lobby was okay, elevator looked all beat up. We were on the 7th floor. The room was big but it was filthy, smelled like mold, carpet was dirty, ac was dripping, walls looked like they could use a fresh coat of paint, and there were a lot of BABY COCKAROACHES everywhere in the bathroom, the tables, the kitchen, in the cabinets. Yes COCKAROACHES... I had to make sure my kids wore there slippers at all times. I told myself that I would tuff it out and stay at least one night cuz i had no choice so i decided to tak a hot showere the bathroom looked clean but as soon as I turned on the water came COCKAROACHES from underneath the mat. I couldnt sleep that night because i was afraid and angry. I had to get my family out of there so I was lucky enough to talk to our agent and check into another hotel. Beware of the false pictures of how there room/suite looks like becuz it doesnt look like that. Our first time in oahu and the first night was a nightmare... NEVER, EVER AGAIN WILL I COME BACK TO THIS HOTEL!!!

<Content>Perfect if you... need a reasonably priced, conveniently located room to sleep and shower in. I STRONGLY advise that you make sure that you request a balcony room as they are much larger and a bit nicer than the rooms that are without a balcony (atleast they are nicer than the room we were put in on the 9th floor that did NOT have a balcony). My husband and I had stayed at the A.H.P. before, in 2003 when it was still Aston Honolulu Prince. We had a nice stay then (in a balcony room) and chose to stay there again this year. When we arrived to our room the 1st night it was very late and we were very tired from traveling all day. The room was a non-balcony room and absolutely awful. As soon as you opened the door to the room a terrible smell just about knocked you out, it was very hot (the air conditioner was turned off) and the carpet was wet from wall to wall (with what you ask? I do not know!). Was not what we expected at all. But the next morning we asked to be moved to a room with a balcony and by 3 pm when we came back after lunch, all of our things had been moved for us to a much nicer room for a small upgrade fee. Beginning with the move to a nicer room, our stay was nothing but pleasant. ALL of the staff members were very nice and did everything they could to accomodate us for the 6 nights that we were there. Couldn't have asked for a more accomodating staff or a more convenient location for the price. Would definitely recommend (a balcony room only of course) to anyone on a budget or that doesnt have to have 4 and 5 star atmosphere. Thank you AHP staff!

<Content>would stay here again stayed here for 3 nights at $141 per night including tax. can't beat the price for the location and convenience of this hotel. there was 4 of us in our 20s and we stayed in a one bedroom with kitchen and washer/dryer. very spacious living room , large balcony overlooking the street (we could see the ocean between buildings to the left and the mountains to the right) , located near plenty of shops and restaurants, a short walk to the international marketplace. large bathroom. sparsely furnished, older decor and furniture but our room was very clean. of course a beachfront, well-appointed hotel is ideal but for budget-minded travelers this is a great deal. the staff was helpful and friendly enough. free wi-fi in the lobby only.

<Content>Plesantly suprised To be honest, i wasn't expecting much. I was looking for a budget hotel and my travel agent suggested this one. After booking i jumped on here and read some reviews and i thought i had made a mistake in choosing this hotel. How wrong i was. Maybe it's because i wasn't expecting much but i found the stay amazing. The hotel staff were very friendly and courteous. The only negative things i could say are the elevator was slow ( i stayed on the 9th floor ) and on one morning (after i was already awake ) there were work men painting or something outside my window, but i just closed the curtains. None of these things affected my stay in anyway. I would happily stay again at this hotel and i recommend it to any traveller on a shoestring budget.

<Content>Never again In desperation, I booked this hotel for the whole week as I waited for a room for rent to become available in Kailua. I pulled up to the hotel and there was no parking, not even at the hotel across the street had parking available. The hotel is also under construction. Upon check-in, I asked the front desk clerk where I could park. She rudely said, I don't know, at another hotel or curbside. She was obviously having a horrible day, taking it out on customers. I went up to my room and while opening the door, several German cockroaches ran out of the bathroom. Having worked in pest control in a previous job, I immediately knew there was more bugs than that. There were 2 beds so I flipped the mattress on one and found bed bugs. The other bed was still good. The wall paint is peeling (probably why they are under construction), the a/c was noisy. After my shower, I called my wife and asked her to book another room at another hotel. While she did that, I called front desk to find out their policy for canceling. The lady downstairs said, We'll only charge you this one night, we have this problem all the time so no big deal. Whew! I was so relieved. My wife booked me back at the Maile Skycourt for the remainder of the week. I stayed there last week and I don't know what prompted me to change hotels. I think it was price. So, I go out to grab a bite with my car and when I got back, I was lucky enough to get a curbside parking, after spinning around several times. However, it was only good until 7am the next morning, which wasn't a problem for me as I leave for work at 6am. This is a shot-in-the-dark hotel, I wouldn't recommend it for families with children unless you really don't mind or just can't help it. The only good thing was the cancellation policy.

<Content>Never again-this was a nightmare Where do we begin? Our family had 2-two bedroom suites and 1 Superior Room for 8 adults and 6 kids ranging in age from 1 year to 9 years. We arrive to find out that there is no available parking and we have to park offsite a couple of blocks away and be placed on a waiting list to be able to park on site. While this is mentioned on the Aqua site, it needs to be emphasized that the alternative parking options are blocks away. We venture up to our rooms only to find that the rooms were not at all as pictured. The two bedroom had one double bed (not a queen bed as stated on the Aqua website) and was the size of a large closet. The carpeting throughout was disgusting to the point that we wouldn't allow the one year old to crawl on it. The sliding glass door opening to the Lanai was impossible to open without getting a running start. The views of Waikiki and surrounding Neighborhoods that are mentioned on the site are really views of an Italian Restaurant, a liquor store and, later in the evening, people stumbling out of the bar in the lobby, not to mention the working girls that frequent Nahua Street. If you lean over the balcony and crane your neck left, you might catch a glimpse of a palm tree on Waikiki, but it isn't pleasant or serene as they state. Oh, and the two bedroom suites are not really two bedrooms. There are sliding louvre panels that separate the spacious living area from the two twin beds. There are also no dressers for storage of clothing except for a desk with a couple of drawers in the bedroom.The equipped kitchen was also not as expected. While there were dishes, glasses and silverware, the pots and pans looked as if they hadn't been cleaned or replaced in centuries and we felt safer eating out. This could have also been influenced by the ants crawling in the kitchen and the odor emitted from the refrigerator that smelled like something had died. The bathroom (one bathroom for a room that sleeps six) had rips in the vinyl flooring, chips in the tiled shower and mold growing in the corners. There was also no bathtub, which can be challenging with so many children. We also ran out of hot water after two showers which caused us to either take cold showers or wait until we had hot water again. Since we didn't want to spend our vacation waiting to take a shower, we opted for cold showers more so than not. We also attempted to do a load of laundry in the laundry facility. There was no water pressure so it took us 2 hours to do a load of laundry from start to finish. The vending machine that sells the laundry detergent took your money but didn't give you anything in return. Trying to sleep at night was also rather challenging with the noise from the bar below, motorcycles and traffic not to mention the other guests screaming and yelling, pounding on the walls and running up and down the corridors. The one bright spot was the staff. Although they were accommodating, they can only do so much with what they have to work with.I would not recommend this hotel to my enemies, let alone anyone that I cared about unless they underwent a complete overhaul including upgrading the electrical system, plumbing and complete remodeling and redecorating of all the rooms and common areas.

<Content>Get what you pay for.. We stayed here for 5 nights. I don't think we'll ever return. Everyone talks about the friendly staff. Wow there must have been some one else on duty. They hardly even say good morning to us. Of course there was no parking spots for us and we had the park at the Hotel next door. We hung our towels up as they asked (to use again) but every day we had clean ones. NOT ONE DAY were our beds made. Most places at least do this. Couldn't tell if they cleaned at all. Someone would open our drapes part way so people walking by could look right into the room. All the doors slam shut so you know when some one comes or goes from a room by yours. Had to sign a paper stating no smoking in hotel or you would be fined $250.00. The best thing about this place is it is just a few blocks from the beach and lots of shopping.

<Content>Very budget hotel This is not meant to slam the job anybody is doing at Prince, but I do want to warn readers that the room we got was the equivalent of a $39 room along the highway in the states (mainland I guess). Maybe we're too picky, but we didn't even end up staying in the room. The staff was very kind in allowing us to transfer to another Aqua hotel. I have to say that within the Aqua chain, Prince may be cheapest but there are better deals out there.

<Content>Dump I booked this hotel thru a travel agent as a cheap airfare/ hotel package. I knew it was a cheap deal but the location seemed good and the reviews on Trip Advisor did not seem too bad but what a dump. Guess I should start with the good points. First off it was very central, right in the middle of Waikiki in Nahua Avenue. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. I found the beds comfortable. Those are all of the pluses I can think of. Now the bad points. The room had two windows with no view appart from the hotel opposite 25 feet away. The windows only opened about 3 inches, one was cracked and had a piece of twisted wire as a latch. The curtain that covered one window would not stretch all the way across. The bathroom was very basic, fixtures and fittings from the early 60s, the mirror in the bathroom was so old the silver had come off the back. There was an old window airconditioner mounted above the door, it worked okay but was so noisy that I had to turn it off if I watched the TV. The carpet was not really clean and I noticed that after the maid service the same pieces of lint never seemed to move. The TV remote did not work (think it was the wrong remote for the TV). There was no coffee maker, there was a refrigerator but it was old and very small. There were a few ants in the room, no big deal but then I saw a cockroach. They don`t worry me but some people might be offended.

<Content>I would not let my Dog stay here We where scheduled to stay here 15 nights; however, all we could take was one night. The hotel says no smoking but all the rooms smells like smoke. This is because all the windows are slated glass and do not close all the way, so the people that smoke on the balcony might as well be standing in your room. They do not clean the room everyday, only replace towels and take out the trash. You have to ask for a full room cleaning, and then they will put you on the schedule for one. The air conditioner froze up four times during the night. We had to get up and turn it off so it would defrost, so we could somewhat cool the room. The non-closing windows might have something to do with the freezing up and not cooling very well (by the way, them none closing windows let allot of noise in). When we got up in the morning there was little bugs all over our stuff. The beds where very hard, springy, and uncomfortable. After all was said and done when we checked out our 68.00 dollar room cost 103.00 with all the hidden charges (parking, local phone calls, ect.). It was not really a budget hotel, it was a dump that it would not let my dog stay at. I'm now in a nice clean quiet hotel that includes breakfast and internet for 125.00 with taxes, parking, local phone calls, ect. DONT STAY HERE!!!

<Content>Great place for budget minded This was a very nice, older hotel for the budget minded. Our room was nice and big with a wonderful kitchen. We really enjoyed the stay. The personnel were all very helpful especially Isao at the front desk. Isao helped us arrange an extra day so we could shower before we left late at night. We had a wonderful time and it was nice to be able to walk across the street to the International Market. If you're looking for a fancy place this isn't it. Our family was more than happy with the room and the great service. Thanks for everything!!!!

<Content>Above and Beyond Customer Service was incredible. My family of 4 had a one-night stay before flying home. The hotel was in the process of renovating at the time. The older style room we had was unremarkable, but the newer rooms were VERY nice, projection tvs, sleek decor. Really cool. We had an evening flight so at checkout we asked if they could hold our luggage for the day. In stead of just agreeing, they actually offered us the FREE use of one of the renovated rooms so we could go to the beach one last time and still be able to shower up and change into travel clothes before going to the airport. The staff was so helpful and friendly, it was just an incredible show of aloha and a great way to end the vacation. Can't believe it's take me long to post this. Give this place a shot!!!

<Content>Disappointing I was only there for 2 nights. It was not the hotel I had originally booked. I originally had booked the Aqua Continental. Upon checking in, the front desk advised me that there had been a booking problem and that they had moved me to another of their properties.  First, let me say that I am an airline employee and had called ahead and got what I thought was a great airline rate. Because we all know Hawaii isn't cheap. So when I was told that I had been switched to another hotel, it didn't faze me because with my rate, these things happen. And in the airline industry we know that THINGS CAN CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE!! I knew going in that the Aqua Continental was a budget hotel so I didn't expect much. But usually when you are moved to another hotel, it's one of equal or better quality. Well, that didn't happen. Upon walking in, I was greeted by what looked like some local thugs, in a dingy lobby that had seen better days. The staff at the front desk were nice enough. The elevator took forever. It was so bad that I only used it to go up whenever I was in the lobby. I always walked down the stairs in the fire escape. The room was halfway decent. The carpet was filthy and stained. I bought a cheap pair of flip-flops and walked around the room in; as i refused to walk barefoot on the carpet. The furniture was out of the 1970's. The remote even had stains on it. I was quite upset upon finding out that the hotel did not offer free internet. On the website the Aqua Continental says it has free high speed internet access. The Honolulu Prince had High Speed Internet at $9.99 a day. Upon finding this out I called the front desk and they gave me the High Speed for free. When I arrived at the hotel, I just wanted to grab a bite to eat and take a nap, as I had worked a full and busy eight hour shift before hopping on the plane and taking that 5+ hour flight from the west coast. I did not have my wits about me. If so, I would not have settled for what I did. I feel that the folks at the Aqua could have at least emailed me to advise me of the change, then I could have made the decision if I wanted to go through with it, or negotiated something else. Because just around the corner from the Aqua Honolulu Prince is the Aqua Waikiki Wave, which seems to be a better quality hotel from what I saw. I just found my whole 2 night experience there LACKING. The only good thing I can say about it is that it's in a good location off Kuhio, near restaurants and FoodLand. But personally, I couldn't recommend it to others, especially other airline employees who might be taken in by the cheap airline rate. But hey, if there is a bunch of you 20 somethings that are new to the industry and want something cheap to split between a few people ..............this would be the place!!!! I have always had better luck with the Outrigger and Ohana hotels.

<Content>What a pleasant surprise We really enjoyed our recent 3 night stay at this hotel. The front desk was always staffed by professional and pleasant personnel. The views from our very spacious balcony on the 10th floor were great. Although we were out and about most of the time, it was always a pleasure to come back to the room (clean, spacious, comfortable and cool) to relax or to sleep for the night. The complimentary daily newspaper delivered to the room each morning was a pleasant surprise.As far as I鈥檓 concerned, I prefer this hotel over the others in Waikiki, even the ones on Kalakaua Ave. Great value for the money but even more, it鈥檚 a nice, friendly and safe place to stay. Special kudos to Isao, thanks for being such a 鈥渘ice guy鈥?

<Content>comfortable friendly and warm Whenever I am in Honolulu for business I am always sure to stay at the honolulu prince hotel. It is a hotel that is run like a family business where each and every employee takes pride in the job that is to be performed like they own the business themselves. we are treated with courtesy, respect and warm hospitality that is synonomous with the spirit of hawaiin aloha. Isao at the front desk always treats us like a family member and I always look forward to future visits. I consider the honolulu prince my family and home away from home.

<Content>Wonderful, Elegant, Kind....I can go on and on, Loved the Honolulu Prince!!! Let's see, we arrived on the 23rd of April...went straight to the hotel to check in, we were greeted kindly. The check in process took minutes and we were up in our room in no time. The room is great, it was large, huge balcony with table and chairs....everything that I needed was there and I was really pleased after a long flight. If you ever come to this hotel, talk to Isao wonderful guy, helped me out, treated us very kindly and answered any questions that I had. I wanted to take a trip, sight seeing around Honolulu and he pointed out some great spots, I went there and they were wonderul!! Thanks Isao. Staff is great, room was awesome, I'm well pleased for the price I paid. We had scooters so parking was free, but if you have car you have to pay extra $18 a day. Honoulu parking is horrible all in itself, recommend getting a scooter. It's Fun!...back to Hotel...I'd give it a five star for the price I paid AAA+++. Again, come...enjoy the stay here and you will not regret it. Just dont think it's Hilton top of the line hotel, if that then...yeah, you'll be dissapointed. Aqua Honolulu Prince, I'm deffinetly staying here for my next visit. Thank you staff!!

<Content>Great value, Huge rooms We were really happy with this place. We come to Waikiki a lot, but always on a tight budget. The Prince has a very central location but sometimes it was like no one was home. We were there last week and the place is still run down but everything is clean, rooms are big and everyone is friendly to us. For $76 we got a superior room with a really big lanai and comfy beds.I would go back again soon.

<Content>hole in the wall, literally; five star service I chose this hotel because of its central location and not the reviews on this website. If my choice was based off of that then I wouldn't even consider staying there at the Honolulu Prince. You can pay hundreds of dollars and stay at any hotel in Hawaii that has a pool, ample parking, nice soft beds, and all that other stuff, but all of that is nothing if there is no Aloha. This hotel may not have all that, but you get what you paid for and then some. The service given here by the staff at the honolulu prince is that of a five star hotel. I've seen guests yell at these individuals for things they practically have no control over and yet still be able to keep a smile and help them. I've asked some questions about certain things and although they may not have the answer there and then, but find it for you despite the ringing phone and the other people asking for other things. Walking in from the beach the other day, I was greeted by a staff member using my last name. I had to ask, out of the hundreds of people staying here, how did he know my last name; his reply, Thats because i checked you in. That was 8 days ago! Granted the hotel needs a huge make over and some parking, but don't be so quick to judge. I am glad I didn't; I enjoyed every single one of my 20 days in honolulu. Thank you so much Sharon, Big Mike, and Harry.

<Content>EXCELLENT SERVICES I have just returned to Guam after staying twice at the Aqua Honolulu Prince in Oahu, Hawaii. I am a returning guest of the hotel because of its excellent services. The staff, especially the guys at the front desk, particularly Mike and Isao are two of their best people. As an administrator who has been traveling since 1974, I have had my share of hotels and motels during my many years of travel. I have stayed at five or six stars and I have also stayed at lesser expensive hotels such as Motel 6. To me, it is not so much that a hotel has to offer in terms of its amenities, but rather the services the hotel and its staff provides. Over the last three consecutive years of my travel through or to Honolulu, I have always asked to stay at this hotel simply because of the excellent services that its staff are providing the guests. To me Mike and Isao are the people who makes this hotel a six star in terms of its excellent services. I am planning to continue to stay at this hotel all of my future travel to Hawaii.Keep up the excellent work, Mike and Isao, and I hope to see you soon.With warmest and gratified Aloha,Yoichi K. RengiilDirector, TRIO Programs[-]
