<Content>superb rooms rang and booked on the day. Excellant front desk, friendly staff, wonderful rooms with pool set in a beautiful private garden, grounds nice. Great place for romance and laying by the pool but a little far out you always had to take transport( free to Ubud in 15 minutes) We thought the food was good but expensive for Asia.

<Content>Rather average Pros:-Spacious and well equipped villas-Great and spacious bathrooms-Serene and scenic location within the rice paddies-Dedicated and friendly staffCons:-Very strange booking conditions (booked direct with them and tried to change to a different package and was told that this is not possible and I would have to pay a fine)-Despite being asked for credit card details upon booking, the stay needs to be settled in full upon check in (never happened to me before; slowed the check in time down to more than 30 minutes)-Asked for a quite villa and was sandwiched between the only 2 occupied villas (only three out of 14 were occupied; so they did not bother to consider my request).-Overpriced and rather mediocre food and beverages (a watered down long drink costs US$ 15)-Very average and overpriced spa-All day music from the pool bar-Just a 5x a day fixed shuttle service to Ubud instead of shuttle service on demand as for other properties of this price range-The DVD library was a poor range of pirated DVD's of inferior quality-Poor quality of bathroom products (expected the usual spa products...but it was a rather poor range of products).Overall a just average stay; there are a number of much better villas in Ubud which provide better value for money

<Content>Nice but dirty We stayed there for 7 nights. We would definitely go back but we must warn travelers out there. What the reviews that I read about Furama didn't say. There are tiny bugs that we had to kill before getting into bed (they are everywhere if you look). They use bug spray in your room every early evening. There were stains in the window treatments, bed sheets, and towels (although you can smell that they have been washed). Sounds of nature and nosy next villa neighbors can be heard. The padlock door is charming at first but can become akward after a while.Now the good: The staff is friendly and helpful. There are 5 free shuttles going into Ubud everyday. The villa is nice if you overlook the negatives that I've already mentioned. The thatch roof and tropical setting of the villa are beautiful. The private pool and outdoor shower are nice amenities.

<Content>Taste of real Bali Wow, what an amazing hotel, the location of which is absolutely breath taking! We stayed here for 3 days and the pool villas are just beautiful and perfect if you are on honeymoon or just want a relaxing break. The hotel staff can not do enough to help you during your stay, nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is approx 20 minute drive from the centre of Ubud, but the hotel provide a free return shuttle bus 5 times a day at various times. We also received other perks such as a 4 course free italian meal during our stay which was very tasty, complimentary water in your room and free transfer to the airport. We also used the hotel trip service to sightsee around Bali, which was fantastic value for money 拢18 each for a 9 hour tour. The driver was more than happy to take us anywhere we wanted. It was nice to see real Bali after staying for our first 6 days in the rather western manufactured resort of Nusa Dua. I would highly recommend this to anyone and hopefully will make a return in the not so distant future.

<Content>didnt want to leave to anyone who is thinking of staying in a wonderfull place that is beautiful and quiet you cannot go past the furama.we stayed there in august of this year during a hindu festive weekend and we loved the warmth of the local village people and the staff of the hotel, the deluxe pool villa was a great choice and the room is lovely.it is a little way from ubud town but that is half the charm of the place, take a walk up the hill behind through the paddy fields and you will know what i mean. rent a scooter and take in the local sights and the ride is easy and fun.love it to bits and would go back in a heart beat

<Content>Great privacy it was our honeymoon gift and we loved it so much that after a few days on the beach...we came back!We were probably the first backpackers staying there, as we had backpacks (long honeymoon) and a motorbike.Nonetheless the staff was very nice.We have now a Furama enveloppe where every month we put some money. When we reach the sum...we go back!

<Content>Very disappointed My husband and I stayed in the Furama's Xclusive villas for two nights in June this year. This is a new complex adjacent to the regular villas. Thank God it was only for two nights out of our eight night stay in Bali - any longer and it might have ruined our entire holiday. Upon arrival at the Furama, we were very disappointed to find the rooms dusty, dirty and unfinished. To give an example, the toilet didn't work and there was no water coming out of the taps. After two hours of stuffing around, we were finally moved to another room which was marginally better. The hotel was preparing for the official launch the week that we were there and there were construction workers surrounding our room and lots of noise going late into the night. The location felt very remote and we felt a bit unsafe in our room of a night.  But aside from all the issues with construction and an unfinished room, the service was unlike anything I have experienced in Bali before. My husband is a very relaxed, patient man, but even he was ready to pull his hair out time and time again from the horrendous service. No one was ever rude. They were all perfectly nice but so inefficient. It wasn't even the language barrier, they were just very disorganised and more concerned with the officials coming for the launch than their paying guests. We would order room service and it wouldn't arrive, once we booked a day spa package for a certain time, and the spa organised a buggy to pick us up (we didn't mind the walk but they offered the service). The buggy didn't arrive and by the time we walked up to the spa, we were 15 minutes late for our session and were told we would have to rebook for the following day. This wasn't a one-off, something liked this happened every day. The restaurant was also average, though there are some great spots to eat in town. A few other couples we met at the resort were also frustrated at the lack of service. This was my fourth visit to Bali and I have stayed at so many great hotels, this was very unexpected. We came to Ubud for a relaxing getaway and were so stressed the entire time, we felt like a huge weight had been lifted off our shoulders when we finally left. Prior to this hotel we stayed at the Ayodya Palace in Nusa Dua and after at the Conrad in Tanjung Benoa. These were amazing hotels - beautiful grounds and wonderful service. I wouldn't stay at Furama Ubud again for free. That said, Ubud is a fantastic place to visit and we will definitely return (and stay elsewhere).

<Content>Superb place Aussie, 41 from Sydney. Stayed in a deluxe villa with my girlfriend for 5 days. Perfect place, fantastic villa and superb staff. Food was excellent, did the cooking class and ate our food for 2 days too! Massage in the hotel a bit pricy compared to ubud town but very good and convenient and lovely setting. Recommend to anyone and would go back.

<Content>Magical! We travelled to Bali as two couples in our mid-twenties. Looking for adventure, romance and a relaxing holiday this is certainly what we found at Furuma.We stayed in two self-contained pool villas for two nights.As everyone says - the staff are the most friendly, helpful and genuine hotel staff we've come across in our travels around the world.Greeted by drinks, a towel and a massage on your own massage bale in the villa garden (though beware - this was a bit of a pummeling!) was a nice welcome.Our villa was phenomenal - quite quirky but if you're looking for authentic, traditional balinese decor and your own private space this is it - and at such a reasonable price (though I'm sure this will go up when the spa is completed). There is a private, clean swimming pool and a bath that could probably fit 10 people in it! The outdoor shower is very cool too - a quite unique experience at nighttime.Minor criticism - the bed sheets and bale sheets smelled a bit musty but I don't think you can expect Ritz standards in rural Ubud.Breakfast is phenomenal - a feast. This was the only meal we ate here though.There was building work going on near our villas but if you're quite active and out investigating Bali during the day this is no disturbance! We used the complementary shuttle service into ubud both days (again - reliable and handy) to see more of the cultural centre. Having been to the centre, I actually would not want to stay there - parts of it felt slightly threatening as night drew. Furuma offered the ideal balance of having luxury accommodation in peaceful surroundings whilst the opportunity to travel and see tourist areas, if you so wished. Top tips for Ubud itself: Eat/drink at The Three Monkeys and talk a walk along the Campuhan Ridge.We were shown the new luxury villas. They look lovely - clean, modern and comfortable but in my opinion, having travelled all the way to Bali, I wanted to stay somewhere different to my apartment in London.We would definitely stay in Furuma again and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience balinese culture and lifestyle with westernised amenities.

<Content>A Romantic and Secluded Spot near Ubud I loved this hotel! The most romantic I've stayed in.My husband arranged for us to spend several days at the Furama Villas and Spa and got a great package through their website. We stayed in one of the Deluxe Pool Villas which offered a traditional-looking Balinese villa (with a/c) which included a spacious bedroom/sitting room and bathroom with a huge tub. Fortunately, the hot water was instant and continuous, so you could actually fill the tub up. Outside was a walled-in garden with its own private (chilly) pool, a lovely veranda and tropical flowering plants. There was also an outdoor shower in back.The hotel offered several shuttles a day into Ubud. Otherwise you can relax and enjoy the quiet nestled among the rice fields. The only drawback is that they fumigate for bugs every Saturday afternoon. This means loud machinery and clouds of poison. Sadly, we chose Saturday as our day in. But it was on all other counts a lovely day.The breakfast buffet (included with the room) was very good with lots of fresh, tropical fruit, eggs, breakfast meats, various breads and pastries, cereal, and yogurt on request. We were disappointed that the menu didn't include Indonesian food, but found you could get it on request. We had a nice set dinner one evening (also part of the package) with salad, fabulous asparagus soup (and I don't like asparagus that much), gado gado and fresh fruit for dessert.Hotel staff were very attentive and accommodating.

<Content>Wonderful Experience! The room and environs were fantastic....Totally private, supplying everything your heart could desire. Staff were ever-friendly and efficient.Hotel is a little out of Ubud town, but don't let this put you off, as we wouldn't want to stay in the town anyway, and the shuttle service supplied by the hotel more than met our needs.Breakfast was adequate, but not lavish, with the staff more than willing to satisfy one's needs. Suggest you try the Bali coffee (if you like it strong!)Evening meal was a little disappointing; 'imagine this will improve with time. A good restaurant in Ubud was The Dirty Duck: pleasant setting, great food.Would definitely return to the Furama on any future visit to Bali. It was far superior to anything else we saw in Ubud or NusaDua (our two destinations).

<Content>Furama is fantastic! The Furama villa  Spa was great ! we stayed there for 3 nights in may and was blown away by beauty of their villa and the great service and warm hospitality! The staff knew you by name and always make an effort to strike up a conversation or greet you :-) The privacy of the villa was great esp with the lovely pool and outdoor showers! Try the cycling excursion booked with the villa and you get to see the padi fields and villages of ubud. The villa guide, Darsana, is ready to explain all local traditions of the balinese ppl. It's a cultural experience you should not missed! Highly recommended for honeymooners to try their FuramaExclusive suites.. u simply won't want to leave after wards

<Content>Its a Fair hike to ubud the furama villas as a stand alone place to stay was a lovely place. the staff where really great and the villas very beautiful.the sign post in the street out the front only indicates the turn off to the hotel on one side of the sign. therefore if you are comming from the unfortuante side that is not sign posted then you will drive straight past it.also it is at least a 20 minute drive from ubud town itself and this coupled with the lack of signs made visiting the area a little more difficult

<Content>Spoiled This hotel is beautiful. I stayed for two nights. The villa was great, thatched roof, outdoor shower, huge bathtub and a pool in the garden. The staff were incredible. I mentioned a local product I like and they were quick to make sure I had some with each meal. Breakfast was included with the stay and they offered room service or eating in their restaurant. The welcome massage was very nice.I would recommend this hotel to people with their own transport as the shuttle schedule was not very convenient and they did try to charge me more than double the written price for an airport transfer. Each villa is separated by a wall and I could have been the only guest for the quiet and attention paid.

<Content>Furama is Fabulous Wow, what a wonderful place to stay. I stayed here with my husband, 2 young kids (2 and 4) and another girlfriend. We stayed for 3 nights, and rented a Royal Pool Villa. This was fabulous, she had one villa, my family had the other, but we had the common pool (not just a plunge pool), lovely garden, massage gazebo etc. We all thought this was the most amazing place to stay, the service was exceptional , and due to the privacy on the villa, we rarely saw anyone else. The quality of the villa was fabulous, the semi outdoor bathroom was just great. From our villa we had lovely views of the farmers working in their fields.The staff here could not do enough, when we started getting sick of the menu (the only negative thing I could say, gets very tedious quickly), we had a chat with the chef and he made us our own tailored dinner! We also had a private seafood BBQ in our villa, own chef, musician, villa garden decorated with candles everywhere and flowers all in the pool - very special (for $US35 a head for the adults!)They were wonderful with the children - everyone knew there names, and there was some lovely presents from the staff!Yes it is 'isolated', but that is also its appeal (hence you have to travel away from the resort for any other meals) It is only a short shuttle into Ubud. Raj the resort manager also gave us a tour of the lagoon rooms - WOW - these looked fabulous. The place to stay as a couple.

<Content>Lovely villa with private room and great garden... Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in October. The villa was just great. The garden was a very good size, with its own swimming pool and gazebo for massage in the villa, although we sometimes used it for our afternoon sleep (!)....Yes the hotel was a little far away from time, but its only 20 minutes in the free shuttle and then you are in central Ubud. Shuttle only operates till 5 pm though and then the last pick up is 9pm, so unless you can stay in Ubud town for 4 hours otherwise you would have to take a taxi back, but it's not expensive...I requested a birthday cake delivered to our villa as it's my husband's birthday, it was great. I was surprised when I checked out, I thought the cake would be free....didn't want to argue with the staff, so paid at the end. Restaurant was alright, there's not many choices for breakfast, but it's difficult for the hotel I guess as they have 18 villas so it's difficulte to serve buffet breakfast I guess!They are building 18 more villas called 'lagoon villas' and there's construction going all the time but we couldn't hear any noise, so no problem with that....
