<Content>Lovely Liana Reviewer: from Bristol EnglandWe spent a very pleasant week at this lovely hotel, the Liana in Florence. Everything we needed. Friendly and efficient service. Lovely room with artistic ceiling, with excellent shower room. The breakfast was very good indeed with a wide choice of things to enjoy. The hotel decor is lovely, being very artistic with different arrangements and interesting pictures. We had a problem with midges (in November!), but the hotel staff gave us a plug-in midge killer and we had no problems after that. The hotel is conveniently situated, being only about 10-15 minutes walking distance from the main Florence attractions, which there are, of course, so many. You should not starve, there being lots of places close by to eat and drink, with friendly staff to serve you. November seems a good time to visit this fine city, because it is less crowded and there is little queuing. As well going to see Michaelangelo's David (absolutely stunning), the Cathedral (Duomo) and the Medici chapels, don't miss a visit the chapel of the Magi (wonderful frescos of the magi) in the palazzo Medici Riccardi.

<Content>A Florentine feeling! A beautiful hotel, that let's you feel you are really staying in Florence, with the frescoes on the ceilings and walls. Breakfast was a full selection of fruit, cereals, breads, sweets, and coffees. It's a little off the beaten track, and only for the young at heart, or those armed with comfortable walking shoes. Perhaps not the best choice for an older crowd. I was told there was a handy bus to the train station, but preferred to walk. Laura, on the front desk, was outstanding. Knowing we would be staying for a week, she changed our room to one which was more spacious, room 3, which truly added to our enjoyment of our trip.

<Content>Very quaint quiet European hotel My family and I were very pleasantly surprised by this jewl of a place in Florence. Our travel agent had made the booking on Hotel Connect so were not expecting such an authentic European hotel. There were four of us (my husband and I and two teenagers. We had room Number 1 on the main floor. The room was very spacious including the bathroom and had the two extra single beds in a loft area. The hotel responded to our pre checkin questions via email very promptly. The staff all spoke excellent English. The lady who checked us was very helpful in orienting us to Florence as we only had one day in which to explore the city. She made reservations for us at a nearby restaurant called Aquacotta that we were equally pleased with.I wouldn't have been surprised to hear noise as the buiilding was so old but we didn't. Hopefully though we didn't disturb anyone else as we did have to leave early for our flight home. Our room did open out onto the very lovely garden at the back but we didn't spend enough time in the room to make use of this.We were also quite pleased that the hotel had a computer in the lobby area as well as quite reasonably priced wireless access. It actually worked in contrast to our other experiences in Italy. Perhaps we lucked out!There were only two problems which didn't mar our experience too much - the water from the air conditioner condensed down on to the floor by the patio door leaving a puddle. As well, the first desk clerk upon hearing that we would be leaving before breakfast insisted that we eat breakfast first and said that something would be prepared for us. When we went out early the next morning - the night clerk hadn't prepared anything because no one had left him a note. So we had breakfast at the airport instead.

<Content>Very Charming; exceeded expectations We found the hotel to be very nice! Our room was spacious; there was plenty of room for 4 (2 adults  2 teenagers). The high, frescoed ceiling as well as the furniture were beautiful. The breakfast served in the dining room was very satisfying and the staff was always very helpful. The only negative was the absence of an elevator. Since we stayed in July, bringing up all of our luggage left us hot and exhausted; however, I think adding an elevator would only detract from the old world charm of this beautiful pensione. Staying at the Villa Liana enhanced the experience of being in Florence.

<Content>Get the right room! Booked this hotel after reccomendation from family member as a quaint, well located hotel.Location was great, just 10 mins walk to the sites on quiet street away from the masses of tourists!We walked from bus station which was about 30-40 mins on cobbled streets so if you have lots of luggage i would get taxi from bus station!We stayed in a lovely spacious room, room 5, On 2nd floor. Lovely view over garden and nice and clean.We did hear of guests complaining on the ground floor with a room looking at a wall! So if you do book ask for a nicer room! We were happy with room 5.Breakfast was fantastic and staff very helpful.No lift, so we had to lug our bags up a large flight of stairs. No staff offered to carry bags up. So if you have poor mobilty this may be an issue. Also breakfast is on 1st floor so 2 large flights of stairs would have to be climbed.Overall a very pleasant stay, but ask for a good room!

<Content>A Very Pleasant Surprise in Florence I just got back from a week in Italy, and received a very pleasant surprise at Hotel Liana. The room was very spacious with extremely high frescoed ceilings. The furnishing was very tasteful, and the bathroom was recently remodeled. The hotel has a romantic atmosphere, and is in a quiet, but yet somewhat central location. The breakfast was excellent and plentiful. Overall, you will receive a great value for your money.

<Content>A Terible Experience on my birthday We stayed at the hotel Liana on my birthday. It was supposed to be a special treat, but it turned out to be a special nightmare.We were given a garden room on the ground floor. Its connection to the garden was that it faced a garden wall. The room was very basic and the furniture arrangement totally defied common sense. Our bathroom was only accessible after we removed the desk chair. The bathroom was very basic and very small, ones elbows were in danger of getting abbreviated when brushing hair. There was a stench in the room when we arrived, but we attributed it to the city problems. It turned out that the problem was a stench from a toilet across the hall. We could not get any sleep as the toilet was used frequently during the night and the door of that toilet was slammed each time. The lack of any sound proofing made it appear as if someone was right in our room.To make a reservation we first contacted the hotel via e-mail to make inquiries regarding availability and prices. We were offered a room at a rate of 150 euro a night. We made a final reservation by phone because we did not want to give our credit card number via e-mail. When we were checking out we were charged 170 euro a night. The person who corresponded with us via e-mail and offered 150 euro per night, was not working the day we were checking out and the staff claimed that they had no knowledge of that original rate quote, since our correspondent left no notes to that effect. The e-mail offering that rate was apparently not sufficient. I wrote a letter to the hotel owner/ manger describing the experience but received not even a word of apology - it was ignored.  I would suggest that travelers to Florence IGNORE THIS HOTEL.

<Content>Villa Liana - pleasant accomodations in Florence We stayed at the Villa Liana in late November-early December,2005. This trip was in place of a trip that we had scheduled for February, 2005. My wife broke her ankle a month before the originally scheduled trip. The Villa Liana was very accomodating regarding rescheduling, and even guaranteed us the same rate on the return trip (85 euros). We enjoyed the location of the hotel,as it was only a 15 minute walk to the Duomo, yet the neighborhood was quiet in the evening. There were a number of excellent restaurants nearby, including our favorite in Florence - the Aqua Cotta (recommended by the Villa Liana staff). The breakfast was decent, and there was enough food to sustain us until mid-afternoon. We had a large room on the first floor. The only drawback was that there was an automatic garage door that made some noise in the AM and early PM.We would stay at the Villa Liana again, and would recommend it to friends.

<Content>Terrible Smell and Poor Service Stayed here in September--and neglected to read the reviews on this site. Needless to say, the odor in the bathroom was horrible, but believing that this never happens! I offered to use the bath across the hall after they discovered they were booked full. (Note: I was the one who made the suggestion--the hotel had no contingency plan in place and continued to act shocked that the room smelled). The night manager too was suprised when he found us using his bathroom and we had to explain at 2 in the morning (no one had warned him). Upon check out, they offered no compensation. When reading the reviews and discovering they had lied about the bathroom being a one-time issue, I demanded a refund. After numerous attempts, they did offer me 2 free night stay (pity that I'm in the US and that I'd never stay there again). Happily, Amex saw things my way, and after several months, declined the charge. If you do stay in the hotel, and do have the same problem--refuse to pay upon checkout.

<Content>shabby 3 star hotel At first we thought the hotel was charming because it was old, but after a short time we just thought it was run down and shabby. The bathroom was really small and in need of repair with the bidet practically on top of the toilet. The closet reminded me of something you would see in a tentament buiding--though there was some charm in the high painted ceilings. Not worth the money--especially since we stayed in some other hotels that were the same price in Florence that were much nicer.

<Content>Fabulous florence Just returned from fabulous trip to Tusacny.Staff very helpful and hotel just 2 minutes walk from park which was brillant for our two small children to run around prior walking to all the sites.Room excellent (downstairs) so easy to get pushcair in and out. Four beds plus cot and still plenty of room. Breakfasts were good - but not always clean table ready.Previous posts have highlighted issues with 'smelly drains' - this was not really a problem until our last morning.Overall - good hotel - fanstastic city.

<Content>excellant location with very helpfull staff We have recently retiuned ( 02/10/06) from Florence. We stayed at the Hotel Villa Liana for three nightsWe took a long time and deliberation of our choice of accomodation doing endless surches on the inter-net and mulling over various reviews (Times and Lonely Planet to name two sources).However, we chose this hotel and were more than delighted with our choice. It was such a delight to walk in to the foyer after a frought transfer from Pisa airport. This was due to the Italian's idea of the highway code and our abilty to change gear with the right hand whilst on at the wrong side of the road.The room we were given looked out over the pleasant car park which sounds a bit naff but we had a quaint balcony and below the gravelled court yard has a small garden and water feature with plants and shrubs, and no traffic noise. We were in room 5.Our only regret has to be our failure to pack moscquitto repellant as they had a field day!Breakfast was included and the usual continental meats croiassants were available but toast, boiled eggs ,yoghurts lots of fresh fruit and a large variety of cereals and teas were also available.The rooms and hallways reflect the true Florentine style with frescos on the walls and mosaic tiles on the floors. Our room had an ample bed an arm chair and two seater sofa, along wth T.V and fridge. The wardrobe was large and contained extra pillows and bedding, and we also had air conditioning. The ambiance was nice and relaxed.The staff were helpfull and very polite. We were given advice on places to eat. Taxis were booked on line when requested even pug adapters found when ours did not fit. On our third day we decided to brave the traffic again and head up in to the Florentine hills and the staff advised on places to viist. One Etruscan town Certaldo Alto is well worth a visit dating back to the 13th Century. They were helpfull when we checked out also which was at the ridiculus hour of 3.30 in the morning. The location is so good because you are not in the loud hussle and bussle of the centre or have to pay city centre prices but you can be in around ten minutes. The Duomo could probably be reached in less time.The room rates for doubles was 170 euros on the tariff in the lobby, However, we booked on the inter-net diect with the hotel [----]and got the reduced rate of 140 euros per night. Parking was 15 euros per day cheap for the area.We would gladly return in the future.Maxine and Rich - Aldbrough Nr. Hull

<Content>A great place - depending on which room you're allocated After taking the train from Pisa to Florence we jumped aboard a number 31/32 bus to Piazza D'Azeglio. We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights, split into two parts as we also visited Rome. For the first part we were taken to room 25, a lovely room with a double and two single beds, a fridge and balcony which overlooks the road in front of the hotel. The corridor up the top of the building was a little musty, but we just opened one of the windows in the corridor which overlooks the garden at the back and that sorted that out in a flash.The breakfast was nice and included a good range of food. The building itself was built in the 19th century and apparently use to be the British Embassy. The frescoes on all the ceilings and decor are lovely.However after our initial impression of this hotel we were disappointed with the second part of our stay. As with the other reviews which I have only just read here, there was a sewage problem. Unfortunately despite complaining and asking to be moved to another room we had to stay (we had already prepaid and there were no other rooms available). Room 24 was behind the desk at the back and had a small patio... a wet towel on top of the shower plug hole was left in an effort to block out the smell but in the end we just used the bathroom across the corridor as the smell of bleach and wafts of sewage was a little to much too in the end.Had we not encountered this room I would have highly recommended the hotel... Although maybe when booking, you should specifically ask for a room which hasn't had any reported sewage problems.Florence was a beautiful city and this hotel just 15 minutes walk into town would have have been perfect... It is certainly an above average hotel but they really do need to sort out the sewage problem!

<Content>Great atmosphere I was very pleasantly surprised by the lovely Hotel Liana. I was in a great location, quiet but within walking distance of all the attractions in Florence. The room was fantastic - frescoes on the ceiling and a clean and modern bathroom. We were in a room behind the front desk on the ground floor though, and other reveiws state these as the better rooms. The frescoes in the whole of the hotel give it a fabulous italian atmosphere. The breakfast was plentiful and tasty and the staff were very helpful. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great place to stay! We've just enjoyed a 4 day stay at Liana and would really recommend it. The accommodation is still fairly pricey even staying at the end of March (rather than summer) but given the prices of other hotels in Florence we had a great deal! The website makes it seem as though it is quite a distance from the centre of Florence, but it takes no more than 15 mins walk before you can see the Duomo! There's also a really good bus route if you don't fancy the walk every day. The staff were friendly and the hotel itself was clean and beautifully decorated. We stayed in a double room overlooking the garden. The garden was perhaps a little disappointing, but then being in Florence you're not likely to spend much time in it as there's so much else to be doing! The bedroom was spacious and warm and the bathroom had plenty of hot water (although the old heating system means it takes quite a while to fill the bath!). If I get the chance to go back to Florence I'd definitely choose to stay there again.

<Content>comfortable quiet liana Read previous reviews and a bit apprehensive. Stayed at Hotel Liana for 3-day break. The Hotel was quiet, very comfortable, and clean. Room was a little dated in looks but serviceable with T.V - no AC although cold fan to ease August heat (sweltering 32 C). Great gardens to relax in (though plenty of mosquito's - beware! Was bitten lots. All staff warm and friendly. Although location a little remote from centre of Florence buses easily navigatable and 'hop-on hop-off' tourist bus at end of road with ticket valid for full 24 hours.(pay on bus). Came in from Pisa Airport via train to Florence Train Station then taxi from station to Hotel (7 euro's) - walk will take approx 30 mins. Overall opinion - loved Florence - Great Hotel.

<Content>Liana a good choice Hotel Liana is a fifteen minute walk from the Duomo, but the price, the staff and the room made it worth the extra walk with my group of eleven college students. I shared a garden room with twin beds. Lots of light. Nice and quiet, unlike the area in the city with many of the three star and two star hotels. The shower in my room was one of the hand-held European jobs with no shower curtain, but that was survivable and even comical. The showers in some of the other rooms were American style. A note of caution, ask for a room upstairs or in the back, behind the desk. They tried to put some students in a first floor room in the front, but I made a fuss because the room smelled like raw sewage. I know I am not the only one to have complained about this room. I had read a review before I went that mentioned the same problem. Sounds like a problem with city sewage, but the room would not have been bearable. As a result they put four students in a suite instead of two twin rooms. It was not what I wanted, but a minor inconvenience. Simone and Laertes were especially nice hosts.
