<Content>Had a lot of fun Spent a weekend in the Puzzle Room. Friends stayed in the Urban Voyageur and Re:Fresh.Our room, not as clean as I would have liked. A good film of dust on oh, everything. Room is small, and I would have liked a drawer or two, but hey, it's art. Shower is, small. But, unless you're really big, it's enough to get you clean. I did have to turn it off to shampoo and soap, and turn it back on to rinse. Out of the three rooms, I like re:fresh the best. That was the prettiest, and had a tub.Check in, great, they managed to check us in early, and get us a parking space in the grocery store next door. They only have a few spots there, and if they run out, you have to park at a pay lot two blocks away. They didn't charge us for the parking, I'm not sure why, I think she was just being nice.I took the stairs most of the time, cause the elevator was just too claustrophobic for me, but Hank, the operator is great. And every day at 2 he'll take you on a historical tour of the hotel.Noise is there, earplugs are provided. But I managed to get to sleep without them. The bed was AMAZINGLY comfortable. I usually find hotel pillows horrendous, and bring my own, but I didn't use them this time. Bring your own shampoo. They provide a shampoo bar, it wasn't nice.If you're looking for a luxurious hotel, this isn't it. While the front desk, and all staff for that matter, were fantastic, it's not like you'll wish this were your house. It is however, the most FUN I've had at a hotel.

<Content>Great and Unique I stayed at the Gladstone Hotel a couple of weeks ago, while in Toronto for special occasion. The Front Desk staff was great, I had trouble getting an email printed off, as the do not have a business center, and were unable to ever locate emails I sent to the front desk to be printed.Hank the elevator operator is a delight, and worth the stay by himself.I was in what they call a give me more room, and it was extraordinary. The street noise is not all that bad. despite being on a very busy street.The Staff was was very helpful in getting me to airport, they do not have a shuttle, but they were able to arrange a car service for me and as I found out when I arrived at the airport the front desk clerk (Alex) had paid for the trip as an apology for not finding the emails I sent to be printed.

<Content>Glad I chose it I had a good stay at the Gladstone. It's a fun, boutique hotel in a newly developing area of Toronto, off the map but easy to get in and out of. The trolly car runs directly in front of the hotel on Queen but if you, like me, like to walk, head up Queen West on foot and you'll find some great design shops, restaurants, art galleries, etc.There is a small cafe attached where i had a great breakfast every morning. Food was very fresh and yummy. There is also a bar attached where I had dinner. Also good. Live entertainment nightly if you want. The rooms are designed individually by artists. You can pre-select via their website. I was in the puzzle room. Fun and clever design. The rooms aren't massive but I didn't care. The shower stall wasa bit of a challenge, very tight, but the room was very clean and the bed (linens and pillows) was dream inducing. My only complaint ( and I didn't approach the hotel staff) is that it is very LOUD. The trolley, as I mentioned runs constantly in front of the hotel, the traffic is ongoing,there is a massive construction site across the street, and when the bar downstairs closes, there are a lot of patrons on the sidewalk talking and singing and being happy.If you are a light sleeper, try a room off the front. All-in-all, I'm glad I chose it.

<Content>Funky hotel, but ... Hotel itself is pretty funky and the rooms are unique and very clean. Hotel bar/restaurant lovely. Hank the lift guy, helpful and full of interesting info ... However, checking in was atrocious. Arrived at the hotel at 4.30 pm after a long journey from London. The guy at reception was very unprofessional and very unhelpful. After leaving us standing there for nearly 15 mins he turned to us and said oh, have i been ignoring you?. Then he said the room was not ready. We asked him how long it would be and he said about an hour or so, but there is nowhere for you to wait. After stating that we have had a long flight and want to freshen up and the room should have easily been ready by 4.30pm he said he would have to phone someone else. Managed to book us into another room, which totally defeats the object of choosing and booking our preferred room in advance. I would have then expected an apology for the inconvenience and perhaps a free drink at the bar, but alas nothing.Much as the hotel is nice the customer service by this one particular individual was extremely unprofessional. We would think twice at staying here again even though the neighbourhood is brilliant with lots of trendy, shops, bars and restaurants. A shame !!!!

<Content>Stay here! Spent 4 nights recently in the Gladstone and loved it. Totally agree with all the positive reviews. It's just so different, you really have to see it for yourself! Real old world charm but also very cool  arty. Some rooms are quite small but spotless and well maintained and what they lack in size, they make up for in decor. And if they have availability, you can select your own room. We started in a small room and ended up moving to a king-size bedroom after the first night. But it was all done with no hassle or fuss. The staff are very friendly and happy to help with any questions. Would definitely recommend the Gladstone to young/mature singles  couples, especially if you want somewhere different to the large chain hotels.

<Content>Perfect escape I live in Toronto. So why did I spend a weekend alone there? I was at a crossroads in my life and I needed a place to think. It turns out the Gladstone was perfect for that. Above anything else, it's real. The Melody Bar is a great place; unpretentious and unintimidating, it's a gathering place for generic condo-dwellers like me, postal workers, urban sophisticates, you name it. I avoided the nightly shows and karaoke (for which it is well-known) as I was there to think, and not just be entertained.I did have two breakfasts and two dinners at the Caf茅, and the food and service were exactly what I needed. The lattes are excellent, the blueberry pancakes delicious, and I had the Gasp茅 tourti猫re twice (but then again, I'm a native of Qu茅bec, just like the chef, apparently).I had room 309, called Puzzle, and I found it to be restful and imaginative. The bed was perfect, and the ceilings compensate for the relatively small size of the room. I know some people complain about the washrooms but I've had smaller in France. Everything is extremely clean and has a lot of character. Art works were on display on floors 2, 3 and 4, and there were thought-provoking performances during the Toronto Summerworks festival.This isn't yet another old hotel made into a chichi, pretentious boutique place. The Gladstone has a lot of authenticity, great character and excellent staff. Real people: who knew?A caveat: My room was overlooking Queen St. It is noisy in the evening, mostly due to the single pane windows. Use the supplied ear plugs and relax.Thanks to everyone at the Gladstone for making me feel welcome.

<Content>Best Hotel Stay Ever Found reviews of this hotel on Trip Advisor--I thought it seemed like a really unique place to stay--so i booked the hotel. Absolutely loved it. You can pick the room you stay in-each is different. The room was clean, hotel as a whole very nice and stylish. Staff was friendly and helpful. Thanks!!

<Content>Toronto's Hidden Gem!! If you are tired of the same old hotel room when you travel, the Gladstone is a welcome departure. Staying at the Gladstone is an experience in itself. Each room has been decorated by a different artist and is unique in decor. The standard rooms are small, but more than adequate for couples. I would not recommend this hotel for families or business travellers, and I cannot imagine that is the target market of the Gladstone. The rooms are extremely clean and well maintained.Noise is a bit of a mystery. As some reviewers have mentioned, you can hear other guests very clearly when they are in the halls. So we wondered about the noise between rooms. We heard nothing all night, and were surprised to find that the room adjacent to ours had been occupied, as we saw the staff cleaning the room. Either the rooms are very soundproof, or the couple next to us tipped-toed in and out of their room.The Cafe is wonderful, serving perhaps the best americano I have had in recent memory. And take time to enjoy the art that is everywhere. The light fixtures in the cafe are each a piece of art created from tacky old lamps that we have all seen in a living room in the seventies. Try the vegan chocolate avocado tart (I'm not even a vegatarian, let alone vegan)!Yes the elevator is a bit dated, but it adds to the charm of this hotel that dates back to the 1800s. The elevator is 104 years old! Art is everywhere.The best part of our stay was the staff. Extremely friendly and seemingly would bend over backward for us.The area the hotel is located looks a bit seedy, but this is Toronto folks. I would have no problem walking around, and in fact made a brief trek down the street after dark.So if you prefer to wake up in the morning and not know whether you are in a Hilton or a Holiday Inn; if you prefer art on the walls that is mass-produced; if you prefered hotel employees dressed in ill-fitting uniforms; and if you need a door on your closet: by all means, pick another hotel. The Gladstone is unique in every way, including its eclectic collection of seemingly very happy employees.I can't wait to go back. The Gladstone will be a regular stop for us from now on. So glad' we found it. (Sorry for the bad humour, just couldn't resist).Cheers.

<Content>Something different and a little less bland We stayed at the Gladstone hotel on our last night in Toronto after having lived in the neighbourhood for 2 years (before moving back to Australia). We had often enjoyed a drink in the bar downstairs and felt that staying there would be very fitting as a final farewell to all we loved about Queen Street West. We weren't at all disappointed in the hotel - We found many North American hotels tend to be comfortable but bland and unremarkable. The Gladstone is anything but! The room was small but gorgeously decorated, and it felt really special to know that it was unique. I plan to stay there again whenever I return to Toronto for a visit.

<Content>Not luxurious, but offbeat and really fun My husband and I really liked the Gladstone. We stayed in the Parlor of Twilight room, [--] , because it was the only one with a king-sized bed. Site photo is accurate. The bathroom was really tiny, but everything was clean, and there were interesting local soaps and shampoos. It's not luxurious (for example, the only way to store your clothes is on slightly rough painted wooden shelves along the walls, and the economy rooms really are verry small) and as others mention, the elevator has to be summoned by calling the front desk and asking for it to be brought (the stairs are a workout, very steep, no ground floor rooms). The bed was big and comfortable. We liked the flat-panel TV and I seem to remember it had a DVD player. There was a photo exhibit up in the hallways, definitely an artsy and funky vibe. The best part of the hotel for us was that the decor of our room was totally unique, designed by an artist, with a bizarre metallic ceiling. Purple comforter (not impeccably new, a touch worn), funky round bolster to lean against. Ask the front desk how to turn off the neon flashing tubes outside your window, or they will keep you up at night (we pulled the plug, but I think there's a better way!)We also liked that we could sit in the big lounge outside our room with our local friends, though we didn't want to talk too loudly because we were right outside the other rooms too. The floors slope oddly, but it didn't bother us. The walls are pretty thin and we did get awakened by a fellow guest clomping down the hallway -- might not be for light sleepers.A couple of the front desk staff were snotty, seeming too cool and artsy for the task of customer service, but most were perfectly nice. The parking lot is a rough dirt lot across the street, but we did appreciate having a place to park.One more note is that we were dismayed by the seedy-looking surroundings and the not-very-promising plain brick exterior with low-budget-looking Hotel sign -- we thought we had made a big mistake when we arrived, and we sure wouldn't want to walk around the hotel immediate environs after dark. But the hotel interior is quirky and artistic, with a cool pub inside.Recommended.

<Content>Terrific, Unique Hotel - great for young couples We stayed for 3 nights in the Gladstone Hotel and loved it! We loved to be able to chose our own artist-designed room and found the whole hotel to be great. Definitely a smaller room than most hotels, but wonderful brick facades, hardwood floors and clean bathroom. Comfortable bed, beautiful 3rd floor view of Toronto with a wall of floor to ceiling windows. The location wasn't great, but is on Queen Street West and is a long walk or quick driving to great shops and restaurants. The reception desk was efficient, but not the most friendly... but the bartender more than made up for it. Good food, very reliable. The parking was reasonable at $10/night just across the street from the hotel. Also, free internet! Would stay here again, just in a new artist-designed room.

<Content>wonderful wedding we recently had our wedding (in the first floor ballroom) and reception( second floor reception space) at the gladstone and it was wonderful! the planning process was a little slow and communication somewhat sporadic (i think there were some staff changes somewhere in there), slow to get catering options, confirmation of things, etc. but the day of, everything was perfect. things just happened and we had to worry about nothing. teh catering was great, tasty tasty sushi! many of our guests stayed at the hotel (from my grandmother to friends with newborns, to of course, hipsters) and everyone was utterly impressed. the staff were extraordinarily accomodating and friendly and everyone felt very comfortable. the rooms are beautiful and all design is very thoughtfull, the beds are also incredibly comfortable. the gladstone does not sacrifice comfort for character. we definately reccomend this hotel for hosting an event or for an overnight stay.

<Content>Cool Vibe @ The Gladstone How can you not like a hotel where you have an opportunity to share a beer in the karaoke bar @ 1:00 AM with the chap who earlier in the day shows you to your room? The staff were friendly, accommodating  laid back. I am glad that it is not overly restored and obsessed with being cool.

<Content>Unique and great value I stayed in the Gladstone this June for 7 nights. Its a great hotel and represents great value in a really interesting area of the city. The Drake hotel is 200 yards up the road, double the price and has half the character...although very smart. Our room was small but adequate and well kept. The downstairs cafe serves great food, and while we were there there was live music and comedy every single night. The staff were very helpful and friendly and i'd definitely recommend the hotel for future stays. The Gladstone would particularly suit young couples looking for some culture, good food and music at a reasonable price.
