<Content>Fantastic hotel We kicked off our honeymoon with 4 nights at the KKB in Ubud and loved it. We stayed in a villa with pool which had been recently renovated and therefore beautifully decorated and very comfortable. It was also v close to the hotel's main swimming pool, which was v nice and always empty - almost like having a second private pool!Villa's location within the hotel complex was great, with fantastic views of the river valley and surrounding land.Weather was fab - rained lots at night, which we'd expected, but was lovely and sunny during the day.Shuttle bus into Ubud was useful, but doesn't really run late enough with the last pick up around 6pm-ish. I guess they want to get you back to the hotel so you eat in their restaurant - v easy and cheap to pick up a cab if you do want to come back later though.Staff bent over backwards (though tended to loiter around for tips a little overtly) to ensure everything was perfect, and threw in lots of little honeymoon extras like rose petal-strewn baths and a choc honeymoon cake. Spa is also great and the food is pretty good. The wine was more expensive than we're used to, but we found that across the board in Bali.In summary, an amazing place and well worth considering for a honeymoon.

<Content>Wonderful Stay We booked the Ayung River Villa 4-5 months prior to our honeymoon... and almost all of our expectations were met.The only blemish on our stay was the number of bugs and lizard poop that appeared whenever we were out of the rooms. If I remembered correctly the rooms were cleaned twice a day but you cannot really foresee when the critters are going to stop by...The next time we are staying here, we will request the newer villas with solid wooden roofs to minimize this issue...Since February, we've been to Bali again recently and snooped around in other establishments such as Four Seasons Sayan, St Regis, Bvgalri... Personally I think Kupu Kupu Barong offers a unique stay given its great location and overall excellent service.

<Content>A unique and special moment The Kupu Kupu Barong is a special place to spend a unique moment in Ubud. The hotel is a wonderfull place, with great villas, an excellent restaurant,a very peacefull and relaxing spa, great bathroom and a great panorama on rice fields and the jungle.The Kupu Kupu team is always willing to help and provide a very high quality of service to make the stay even more special. We were looking for something very special (for the proposal) and we had a unique experience thanks to the dedication of the team. The dinner on the infinite pool, facing the jungle, is also a moment of exception. Our villa was tastefully decorated with flowers, candels... everything was just perfect.We will come back!!

<Content>Magnificent and stunning Our 4 nights stay in Kupu Kupu Barong was splendid! After spending some days in the hype of Kuta, Ubud was the location to be close to nature and Balinese tradition. Perfect location, with the incredible view to Ayung river, added up to the romantic yet exotic atmosphere of Ubud - the hotel was very peaceful indeed. The well-presented employees was very helpful to us, since we were not very familiar with Ubud territory. The shuttle car to Ubud center provided by the hotel was also very efficient! The food was a little expensive, but price comes with good quality. I love the little Balinese dancers performance. Truly recommended for honeymooners.

<Content>Not 5-star worthy You can among other parameters judge a hotel on its capability to handle problematic situations. In that sense Kupu Kupu Barong in Ubud is not justified its 5 stars. We booked a stay in an Ayung River Pool Villa but was for some reason downgraded to a Duplex Pool Villa (huge difference) our first 2 nights. Discussions with the hotel staff did not do much good. First they tried to explain that this was in line with our reservation. Since we could document that this was not true they just said they were sorry. They day we should move villa the house keeping were more than two hours delayed in preparing our new villa (which is a lot when your a staying four days and have prepared the move to be on time) and the front desk kept saying it was not delayed. Disappointing and untrustworthy service from the front desk. Again! Beside these situations with the reception/manager we had a great stay but I would never rate the hotel as a 5 star hotel as they do. The villas are with some variations not cleaned very well and look old. We saw/stayed in three different villas (no. 3, 28 and the Royal Suite) The Mango Tree Spa offer spa treatments like it was a factory and the quality is not what we experienced in other hotels on Bali. The butler service is okay but as they try to make it very personal they fail. They cannot keep track on all the information and keep asking the same questions over and over.Overall conclusion. Great location, beautiful setting and view. Ayung River Pool villas are the best pick but do not expect 5 star service (spotless rooms, 5 star interior etc.) or high quality spa and if problems arise do not expect much from the front desk.

<Content>Unforgettable honeymoon I have to say that this place is worth every penny. The staff makes you feel like you are a superstar. They're every where you turn but not in a bad way. Since it was our honeymoon they put flowers in our bath tub and on our beds almost every night.My wife and I loved every second spent in our beautiful pool villa.

<Content>sensational hidden treasure My boyfriend and I recently decided to splurge during a part of our trip to Bali and stayed at the lovely Kupu Kupu Barong. The resort has a bit less than 30 villas on the property and each is two stories. Our villa was larger than we expected and was tastefully decorated. The bathroom had beautiful finishes and had a deep tub for two. When you walked in, there was a small living room downstairs leading to a deck. The deck was one of the highlights as it overlooked a gorgeous valley with a river at the bottom. There is a gorgeous pool on the site, but it is a bit out of the way. it's worth checking out and having a cocktail at the pool bar. The lobby has one computer with free access to the internet.

<Content>Insecure In-room Safe While we had an otherwise excellent stay in Bali, my husband and I were very sad to realize that someone had broken into the in-room safe (an electronic one where you set the combination) and stolen over 10% of our cash (this event could either have been at this location or the hotel they acquired in Tuban). The thief took a few bills in various denominations in various currencies, likely hoping we wouldn't notice the loss. Since we ended up staying at the hotel for the vast majority of our stay and didn't do much shopping, we did notice. So: Travelers Beware!! Avoid placing cash in the in-room safe. If you must, count it before and after you get back.As for the usual things about which people write reviews -- our stay at the hotel was otherwise excellent. Fantastic rooms. Fantastic service, far surpassing anything we've ever experienced. Cleaning was done 2X/day and snacks were left at night. I believe someone had previously complained that towels were refolded and not replaced. The hotel now gives a notice saying that if you want the towels replaced, just indicate this by leaving the towel on the floor. Just so you know, it will be replaced later that day, not while they're cleaning the room that time. If you want the food removed after you've eaten, all you have to do is call the butler and someone will come to pick it up right away (otherwise, yes, it will be left overnight).By the way, the floors are really slippery. You may want to bring slippers with traction to reduce the chance of falling. Our villa had 4 split-levels, so we generally couldn't avoid the stairs.

<Content>Magnificent I took so much care in choosing a hotel in Ubud as it was a very special family holiday for us. I didn't want a soul-less Chain with 500 guests and weren't into the morning tennis/yoga type ones. I really wanted 5 star but with a Bali feel and having looked (I think) at every hotel in the 5 star category am thrilled with my decision to stay there. Kupu Kupu Barong has only 22 Villas with different set ups (see their website). They are thatched (Bali style) and there are beautifully manicured plants and flowers everywhere - it was stunning,We also had special requirements as we were travelling with 10 people - one of whom was quite ill, one was 93 and a 10 month old and Kupu Kupu Barong was great for all!The villas do differ quite a lot (having booked and therefore seen 5 of them) and I definitely think the Aryung Pool Villa topped even the Royal Villa (don't spend the extra getting that).There are Golf buggies you can call if one of the members of your party is old or unwell or indeed if its too hot to climb some stairs or you come back with many bags which was great for our 93 year old party member and me (the shopaholic!). Although there aren't many stairs there are some as its overlooking the river bank. Do be careful if this is an issue for you as other properties have heaps more stairs (which you don't know about until you ask and who wants to walk UP 300 stairs from the pool and get hot again).The staff couldn't have been nicer and more efficient at Kupu Kupu Barong. I really was so taken aback by their attention to detail. It was my birthday when we were over there and they all sang happy birthday to me and knew it was my birthday when they picked me up in the buggy. They were so good with our 10 month old - playing with him, making him laugh and being very welcoming (which often they aren't with children at these types of hotels).The big pool was terrific and much warmer than the villa pools which was great for our little one and older ones alike. There were so many little extras like plates of mini tarts which arrived in your villa each night, welcome gifts, frangipanis on everything in your villa each day and up staircases etc and welcome spelt out in petals on ones bed, robes and slippers on your bed each night - and many more. It was simply a lovely hotel and they bent over backwards to accommodate us and everything we wanted. If I had any criticism and this is me being very picky it was that the food in the restaurant wasn't brilliant (but hey - are any hotel restaurants Gastromomic sensations?). But it was certainly very nice and decent servings and presentation. There is also a separate spa area (not the Mango tree) which was so luxurious I can't tell you and I don't know why they don't have pics on the website. Kupu Kupu Barong was also well placed. It was 10 mins out of CBD so too long to walk but it wasn't half an hour out which some are. It was also close to Mozaic restaurant (an ABSOLUTE MUST), the ribs of Naughty Nuri's (their famous martini will kill you!) and many other things. If you are Australian I recommend booking through BRIAN Fernandes (he was SO GOOD) at Bali Tours www.balitours.com.au. We even got a better deal than I could have anywhere on the Web (and believe me I did my homework). Bali Tours offer extra things like transfers etc so it was all seamless. The thing I really recommend about Brian was he was so knowledgeable, efficient and honest so he would ask questions and say no that property isn't for you and this is why etc. This sort of knowledge of the area WAS invaluable as you can't find that sort of advice on the hotel sites (it was he that told me about stairs in one property etc). Brian - I owe you a big thanks for making our holiday so wonderful - thanks for taking such interest!Bali Tours also offer tours etc but I booked Webee (google him he is famous) as a Driver and he was EXCELLENT and cheaper. Cars were last years, great air con, lovely lovely man.I hope this helps you make a decision but all 10 of us in very different times of our life (we had people in their 20's, 30's, 50's, 60's and 90's as well as a baby) and it was brilliant for us all. I highly recommend Kupu Kupu Barong and hope you enjoy your time there as much if you decide to stay there.

<Content>superb hotel My husband had I had a splendid honeymoon experience in this hotel. We really feel the Balinese hospitality from the day we arrive until we leave the hotel. The staffs are very helpful during our stay especially since it was our first time to visit Bali and we didn't really prepare our holiday plan in Bali. Our villa is amazing and facing the stunning view of Ayung River which made us feel that we stayed in the semi-jungle experience. It was just the honeymoon that I had imagined: layback, tranquil and romantic. I strongly recommended their spa services especially the tree spa experience.

<Author>BerlinTravelaround
<Content>Not a good expierience After reading all the great reviews we decided in the middle of our Bali trip to do a 2night break at KUPU KUPU BARONG. We agree with most reviews about the superb location and the friendly staff, but we were extremley disappointed with the lack of quality of service - way below any 5 Star resort we stayed in before. 1. No one makes the room at night. No fresh towels, only one set of towels per person. If you want hot water for a shower or bath, you have to let the water run for at least 10 minutes before its getswarm.  2. That a Frog jumps in your room happens in the jungle, but that food trays from Room Service in the afternoon were not picked up and stayed all night was disgusting - and the Ants were of course all over it. 3. Very limited selection of wine. A call at 11 pm for a bottle lead to a call back from the Butler that they were very sorry, but they did not have a key for the fridge were the wine is stored. Also the only open White Wine is a local Balinese Chardonay. While we wholeheartly support local efforts to grow wine on Bali, we don't think we should be forced to consume it more then once! 4. One time the battery of the Golf Cart died on the steep hill and we had to push it up, the next time we waited 15 minutes in the pooring rain, and had to walk all wet up the step hill to the Spa... We could continue the list of poor performances, all somewhat small in detail but if you know how smooth and excellent a 5 Star operation should run, this was way off. We had a feeling that while the individual staff member was very eager, there is clearly a lack of management focus in the overall operation. Too bad...

<Content>Just Stunning! We stayed here for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon. We could not ask for anyplace more romantic. Every detail thought out....from breakfast each morning to our names written in rose petals on the bed at night. The staff were amazing and so helpful. Food was a little on the expensive side but was excellent quality. They had a shuttle going into ubud village regularly. The view of the river from our villa was exceptional! There was some noise from other guests - this was quickly sorted out by staff. For honeymooners - I recommend!!

<Content>fantastic getaway Fantastic hotel nested in the valley on the outskirts of Ubud. Super friendly and helpful staff. The place is small enough for personalized treatment, the rooms are beautifully appointed. The restaurant terrace is beautiful. Diner very good although quite pricey. Breakfast leaves to be desired, it was good enough but not 5 star and we were not there to fill our bellies but to relax and had a great time, I would go again any time.A very good restaurant called Gaya is close to the hotel (they will pick you up) even though the hotel does not recommend it, we found it the best around.Internet : there is wireless in the lobby but is is very slow speed. Ok for regular email check, not good enough for fat files. Blackberry worked everywhere.If you go, enjoy !

<Content>Beautiful, tranquil paradise Absolutly fabulous...have stayed in many amazing hotels, and this was no exception....staff were super helpful, nothing is too difficult for them, food is fantasic - really superb....spa out of this world..and all at a fantasic value...Views are amazing..the only very small downside is the two floor villa, pain when you want to go to the toilet in the night (and the tv downstairs so you cant watch in bed!) - However they moved my TV...stayed in villa number 4 which has a full sized swimming pool (very lucky!)..others have a plunge.Really fabulous, perfect for a relaxing getaway.

<Content>Romantic Gateway!!! Actually i stayed there twice already! First on 2004 and the second one recently on April 2007. The first time i went there was for my honeymoon. I stayed in Ayung River Villa with spectacular view! The most great experience for me is their Mango Tree Spa. Totally unique spa experience that i never see anywhere else before. They also use this natural products for their spa which suitable for my sensitive skin. The staffs are really kind and helpful for arranging our first trip in Bali. They also has great food there. The best time would be in the morning where you take breakfast with spectacular view of the hills, rice paddies and the river. I still have this great impression on my second time to stay there. I stayed in other villa which is Duplex Pool Villa, it was different villa which is more spacious and consist of 2 storeys but i still feel the romantic arrangement there. On this second stay, I found this romantic candlelight dinner on the lobbypond and it was a perfect romantic arrangement. Scattered flowers on the pond, gleaming candles around you, one table just for my husband and I to enjoy this spectacular night under the starlights, and excellent choices of menu which makes this service is not just about a great venue factor to enjoy this romantic arrangement. You should go earlier like about 6.30PM to enjoy the spectacular view of sunset in Ubud. I highly recomend this service for couples who would like to have the private romantic dinner. This is non standard restaurant service because you can feel the evening privacy, great service, food, venue and timing. I just can't wait to go back there with my husband for having a nostalgic time.

<Content>The Best Honeymoon We have Could Asked for! This is without doubt the best trip I have ever taken in my life and its all due to the hotel and its staff and the people of Bali. The villas are breathtaking and very, very ideal for couples on their honeymoon...everything from the ambience to the service was excellent. The food was good and we really appreciated the staff bringing down our breakfast every morning to our Villa #17. The honeymoon package is really great ...with the dinners and the spa treatment and the champagne  honeymoon cake. The greatest surprise we had was to be upgraded to a wonderfully romantic suset meal on the lobby pond on our last night there. Every staff at the hotel is fantastic and truly sincere and caring. We felt like royalties and never wanted to leave our beautiful villa. The mango tree spa is really something, a unique and fabulous experience...I could go on and on about this wonderful place and I will truly recommend everyone I know to go to KKB for their honeymoon. I definitely want to go back!

<Content>What a setting! the grounds and scenery are just fantastic! the villas are very private and the views from the plunge pool and patio are great! but the staff and service tops this. they were fantasitc. very friendly, knowledable and extremely helpful. i really enjoyed talking to them and picking up on the culture of the balinese. the restaurant was was very enjoyable for breakfast but for dinner i would suggest going into town...maybe one night if you are staying multiple nights. the villas are very unique and made for a wonderful experience. some of the furniture could use an upgrade but that's getting picky. you won't be disappointed. the setting, service and spa treatments will make for a very memorable experience!

<Content>A pleasant getaway We signed up for the promotion package available for Singapore citizens and stayed for 4 days. Villa 27 (the new one storey villa, next to the Mango Tree spa, not the same villa 27 shown on the website) is fantastic. The room is very spacious and clean. More importantly, the two day beds had full glass walls that gave a sweeping view of the valley and the Ayung River. The villa comes with a plunge pool and a separate outdoor living area where you can enjoy your breakfast and afternoon tea whilst listening to the gushing sounds of the river flowing down below. Indeed very relaxing.Apart from the huge bath tub (that can fit two persons) for which the butler will lay rose petals each day, the villa also has an outdoor shower facility. We didn't use the outdoor shower at all partly because of the lack of privacy (the Mango Tree spa overlooked into our villa, albeit some seclusion provided by overhanging leaves and branches) and partly because there are mosquitoes outside, typical of any tropical spa resort.The villa itself is dim at night, perhaps the intention is to create a romantic feel but we felt that the toilet/indoor shower area could be brighter. One big frustration when you shower is the amount of energy you need to exert to get the shower gel out of the glass bottle. The shower gel is too thick and the bottle is usually filled to the brim so we need to give it a couple of hard shakes before the gel will flow out. Other than this, the villa is great.The service is impeccable even though we only got to see our butler once, when he checks us in. The other hotel staff make the effort to know your name and everywhere you go, you get a friendly hi or nod from the Balinese people. The resort offers hourly shuttle to the Ubud market. The drivers that take you to the Ubud market offer good tips on where to eat. Although the pickup/drop off point is supposed to the at the Ubud Palace, if you go during the low season, the driver can drop you and pick you up at the destinated restaurant in Ubud.Our spa experience is mixed. There is a lot of privacy if you choose to do your massage up at the Mango Tree Spa. Make an appointment in the day so that you can get a good view of the jungle and the river from atop the mango tree. You feel very relaxed listening to the sounds of nature. Over at the Le Spa, we had a 4 hour spa package in the Water  Fire room. Whilst the masseuse assigned to us were good, my husband and I were pretty disturbed by the loud gushing sound of the water fountain inside the spa room. Also, the massage bed feels damp and the headrest has a musky smell. I was also concerned when my pedicure was done in very dim lighting condition. The dinner at the La View restaurant is excellent. We were absolutely bowled over by the lentil soup, a simple dish but very refreshing. The hotel stay comes with standard American or Indonesian breakfast and you can elect to have your breakfast at the restaurant as well. We had two of our breakfast here and found that the food is actually warmer than served in the villa. For the afternoon tea, don't set too high an expectation. It is the same Indonesian cakes that are served each day but still they are quite tasty.Overall, it is still one of the better resorts we have stayed in our numerous trips back to Ubud. The hospitiality of the staff makes you want to come back again. For busines travellers looking for some form of relaxation, take note that the only internet wireless connection is at the resort lobby/front desk. There is a PC provided for you to surf the internet but if you have your own notebook, be prepared to take the buggy ride or the long walk up to the lobby each time you want to check your emails.
