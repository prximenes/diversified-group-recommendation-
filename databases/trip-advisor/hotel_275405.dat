<Content>Too far out for us! Having read the reviews on trip advisor prior to going we expected this hotel to be a little off the beaten track, but on arriving at the central station we were shocked at a taxi expecting 25 euros to take us to this hotel.It must be a 15 minute tramride and there seemed little to do in the surrounding area (no sign of any bars/nice restaurants) the surroundings resembled a London council estate.The hall and reception looked very well maintained and the woman on reception was very helpful, the place did have an air of being rather empty about it though, reception fire was unlit and there was no music playing.In the end we told her that we did not want to stay there due to the location, thankfully she called the sister hotel V Frederick . . . who we were glad to discover had one double left, and we stayed there instead. . .that was more like 10 mins to town centre.

<Content>Interesting but acceptable We recently stayed at the Hotel V in amsterdam during our 14 day europe backpacking tour. First i have to say it is the most expensive hotel we have stayed at during the entire trip (124 euro). I did not realize how expensive hotels in amsterdam are if you don't want to stay in a hostel (hostels in amsterdam are a little shady if your not single and wasted.) Anyway, the hotel itself is located just outside of city center, not neccessarily a bad thing. There is a tram stop just at the corner so it is ver accesable, i believe Tram #4. More importantly when you are not completely with it after midnight the night bus is #355. The entrance to the hotel is a flight of steps that leads you to the lobby with a nice reception area. I guess the lobby person thought we were fit so she stuck us on the 4th floor. Typical amsterdam style, steep stairs that curve around. The room itself was pretty nice. The decor is very 70's with large cushions and weird looking furniture that has no purpose. The bed i have to say sucked. It was two twin beds pushed together, with wheels on a hardwood floor. Needless to say if you are with your significant other, over time there will be a big hole between two beds perfect to fall into. It was quite annoying. The bathroom was nice with a decent shower and good water pressure. The absolute best thing about the hotel is that it is quiet. In addition they provide a fan which is also nice.Overall its a decent hotel. The price is very elevated, but it is at par with most of the other hotels in amsterdam. The distance from the city center is not really as bad as some have made it, i believe its actually better in a way if you are looking for a quite place to sleep.

<Content>Funky and friendly My friends and I go to Amsterdam every year in the spring, and have stayed at a different hotel every time. Hotel V was the best by far. Reservations were handled efficiently, and everyone at the hotel was very helpful. The double rooms are well worth the extra money as the singles aren't half as funky. The location is not central, though it is very easy getting there from the airport. The nightime access is the one problem, I think a hotel either has to have someone up all night to let you in, or give you a key. Having to wake someone - however buff - in their underwear is a bit weird!

<Content>Nice, but nothing special... I stayed two nights at hotel V. They tried to make it as a boutique hotel, but I can say that I stayed in much better three/four star boutiqe hotels in the world. There's nothing wrong with the hotel, but actually there is nothing special.PRICE: I payed 75 euros/night for small single room. Ok price.ROOM: It was small (expeted, as I payed for small one), with balcony (poor view), nice bed but small and average bathroom.LOCATION: It's good for short stay, as you need only 5-10 minutes by tram to train station (RAI) and than 10-15 minutes to airport. But, it's not in the centre and you need 15-20 minutes by tram to the center. Nothing special in the neighbourhood, few average restaurants and the market. I heard famous vienna massage bordel is nearby.INTERNET: Free fast wireless is a big plus for this hotel. You get a password on the front desk. There is also satelite tv with the pay per view option (you need to buy an extra package with remote for a cheap price)HOTEL INTERIER: Very difficult steps to reach the floors (no elevator). Hard for people with many luggage. It's like in some old building where you have to battle with all those sharp steps.Front desk loby is nicely decorated, but that's all.BREAKFAST: Included in price. Again, nothing special, I've seen better. Some cheese, butter, ham, marmelade, crispy, milk, juice and coffee or tea.OVERALL: I am not impress, but for that price in Amsterdam you really don't need to be impressed with hotel like this. Sometimes you have to be satisfied with an average accomodation, because there are many worse hotels in this city for this price.

<Content>Excellent Dutch Service and Style Finally, last month we made our long expected trip to Amsterdam. From the numerous hotels that we checked on the web, Hotel V promised to be cool and central located (but without the noise of a busy street), exactly what we where looking for, so we decided to book this hotel. And it turned out to be the perfect decision. Everything was perfect, the rooms where clean and cool designed, they looked and felt like brand new, the breakfast was excellent with lots of different types of bread, good strong coffee and of course delicious Dutch cheese. At the reception there was 24 hrs. connection to internet (eMac notebook), but the most valuable of all, was the excellent service given by the different people working at Hotel V. Everyone, without exception, was very friendly, helpful and nice, we really felt there at home. All our questions were answered and we got lots of tips where to eat (where not to eat!), pubs, places to visit etc. Our stay in Amsterdam met all our expectations, and Hotel V and the people working there where part of this successful trip. Thank Tom for everything. Good luck!Paola  Marcelo

<Content>Fantastic hotel Everything from the booking, help with restaurants and the place were amazing. Stayed for a friends 30th birthday (16 of us) and the hotel staff helped even with ordering the birthday cake. Rooms were perfectly and tastefully decorated. Breakfast was fab - especially the tea (fine touches to the little things in life). Taxi's were ordered whenever required and drinks very reasonably priced. Would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely visit again. 10 out of 10.

<Content>Very smart boutique hotel with excellent service we selected this hotel based on its description and price and were not disappointed in any way.we had only looked at a few online before selecting this and were pleased with our good fortune.it was easy to access and the staff - especially Jan at the Front Desk who was not only gorgeous, but sweet, attitude free, overly helpful and gave us detailed directions for our very brief stay in now one of my favorite cities - Amsterdam, which i cannot wait to visit again.highly recommended for those who want something stylish nice an accomodating.

<Content>Horrible experience A friend and I stayed here in 2005. I have only recently discovered Trip Advisor and it seems somewhat unfair to post a review over two years later. However, the experience was bad enough for me to get over those misgivings. Where do I start? The hotel is inconviently located. Granted, the public transportation was easy and accessible but the hotel was simply too far from the City Center. That being said, the noise here was beyond acceptable. Even the pipes made noise! Taking a shower here was work - the shower head continutally fell and the temperature vacillated from freezing cold to hot. The hotel was also locked at night -- reminiscent of the hostel lock-out periods of my youth. We returned to our hotel after hours one weekend night and had to wait for over an hour, in the pouring rain, finger on buzzer, for the night-duty person to unlock the door in his underwear. We attempted to address our experience with the front desk the next morning and were unsuccessful. We told them of our plans to depart early, explained the numerous reasons why, and they refused to let us out of our paid reservation and charged us for the full number of nights we had originally reserved. They offered NO apologies and were incredibly dismissive. We ended up going to the train station's hotel desk and getting a room at the amazing Sofitel right in the City Center for LESS than we had paid to be locked out in the rain in the outskirts the night previously.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, away from the stag parties This is a great hotel in a great area - about 15 mins from the central train station by tram. We had a great room with balcony and didn't notice any excess noise from our neighbours.Good recommendations from front desk staff - excellent bars and restaurants easily within walking distance from the hotel. Breakfast also very enjoyable. Best to get down early though. Very good experience. Great for a romantic getaway.

<Content>Really funky little hotel Was pleasantly surprised by Hotel V. Has a lovely ambience and is very very funky, lots of purple and silver with wooden floors. It was in an ideal location as we were going to a gig at the arena but also wanted to be able to get to the centre easily and the excellent tram system makes this easy (it's well worth buying a ticket for a few days, we paid 13.50 eur for 72 hours and you can use these on all trams, metros and trains). Hotel is in walking distance of the de pijp district which is full of cool little bars and restaurants. It's far more 'Dutch' over this side of the city which means you can avoid groups of leery stag parties looking for the red light district. Also close by is Sarphati park which is gorgeous and you're also not too far from Vondlepark. The breakfast at the hotel was great and the breakfast room similarly excellent. The staff were wonderfully helpful and presented us with a map as soon as we got there and really helped us find our way around.

Warm and friendly staff, tastefully decorated yet comfortable rooms, and personalized service; these are the hallmarks of a fine lodging establishment. Hotel V has all this éˆ¥?and more.

<Content>Extremely disappointing This hotel looked fancy on their web site. Therefore I was extremely disappointed when I checked in to a room sized 1,5 x 2,5 meters, and a bed that only would be suitable for very small persons. My guess is that the bed was about 0,5 x 1,60 meters.The shower constantly fell off the wall, as did other items in the bathroom. The room was not cleaned during my two nights stay. The noise from other rooms and common areas was terrible, and there were no decent curtains, only some see through stuff which let all light in.After two nights I moved to the Radisson SAS, and slept a whole day to recharge.

<Content>Five reasons not to stay here You should not stay at the Hotel V, because:1. The rooms are tiny and the beds terrible. Okay, I stayed at a single room, and some of the others might be bigger. But this room was so small they could bearly fit a single bed in there. And tthe bed was so small that my feet were dangling outside (I'm 1.87). The bed was hard, uneven and I only got one tiny pillow.2. I left my room at 10 am and came back at 3 pm to get some rest. The room had not been cleaned. An hour later, when I was having a nap, housekeeping knocked on my door, and gave me an ultimatum: Either I let them in now, or my room wouldn't be cleaned.3. This hotel is quite a long way from where the action takes place in Amsterdam.You can't walk to the centre.4. The breakfast is a joke compared to a full breakast.5. The walls in the hotel ared paper thin.We stayed at the hotel for two horrible nights, and then moved to the Radisson SAS downtown Amsterdam. The price was twice as high, but it was worth every euro spent.

<Content>Hotel V - Please Read This Before Booking - Honest Review We have just returned from a New Years break in Amsterdam.As we always use TripAdvisor before we go away - we wanted to make sure that this hotel got an honest review.The only reason we even contemplated this hotel was due to it being a recommended hotel on the Supperclub website - this was a special restaurant/club that we had booked into over new year and it advertised the Hotel V as a chic, young hotel not far from the centre of Amsterdam.I checked for reviews on Trip advisor and the majority seemed fine - so we went ahead with the booking.I then re-checked the Trip Advisor website a couple of days before going to find several quite bad reviews so we set ourselves up to be disappointed with the hotel.In fact the Hotel was as described and shown on the photo's on the website.I would just consider a few things before booking:There is no elevator in the hotel - we were lucky to be only on the second floor, but if you were unfortunate enough to be on the forth floor - pack light!!!!!The hotel - looks very IKEA-Esque very cool - but very tired!!!!It is quite a distance from the centre (i.e. 15 minute tram journey) so if you want to be right in the thick of the city I wouldn't book this hotel. The Number 25 tram from the stop to the right of the hotel will get you into the centre (dam square, central station etc...).The hotel has very thin walls so can be extremely noisy (i.e. you can hear someone peeing in the next room).The breakfast is an extremely basic continental - but nice that it is included in the price.There are NO tea/coffee making facilities in the room at all.As the hotel is located in a residential area there is not an awful lot to do on an evening nearby - however there are two places that you must go to:If you love Thai food (as we do) then you must go to the local Thai Restaurant called Krua Buppha, Van Woustraat 241 (turn left out of the hotel, follow the road until the main crossroads, turn left down the hight street and the restaurant is about 5mins walk on the right hand side) - the staff are wonderful, the food was to die for and the locals eat there which is always a good sign!!!!!Also if you fancy a drink (as we all do) then you must visit the little pub not far from the hotel (unfortunately I cannot remember the name of it) We walked past it on New Years Day evening on our way to the above restaurant and could hear lots of people singing and dancing inside and thought that it sounded friendly - so on our way back to the hotel we paid it a visit - wot amazing people - it is obviously a bar for the local residents - us two brits walked in and it didn't go silent like a western with tumble weed whistling round our feet like it would in the UK, we were welcomed with open arms and even given our first round on the house (company rule!!!) and given nibbles and snacks from the New Years buffet - it is for this reason you must pay them a visit the people couldn't have been more hospitable. Now in order to find this bar - turn left out of the hotel, go towards the crossroads, turn left again onto the highstreet, then turn left as soon as you can along the canalside, it is the bar on the corner with the Amstel sign above it - amazing........ send them our regards!!!!!!I hope you find this useful

<Content>Fabulous wedding night We found this hotel to spend our wedding night. Is was the perfect atmosphere: hip, designy, small  cosy, personal and modern. As the staff knew it was our wedding night they tranformed the room into a romantic place. But although we had a special treatment, the design of the room was great. Smart solution for the small space they have, and roomy enough. Bathroom was designy too, no standard tiles or sinks. We were the latest guests for breakfast but the lounge style breakfast room was full of nice design details. Smart solution again for the buffet on shelves instead of the standard tabels.We just took a quick view in the lounge which looked comfortable, with internet access. The friendly staff made it perfect.And last but not least very affordable rates.

<Content>Perfect We stayed at Hotel V for one night. I really liked the hotel. It was small,quaint . The decor was cute(very Ikea). There was no elevator, which is common in small European hotels. Some reviews said the location was inconvienient. I found it very accessible by the #4 tram(10-15 mins) to the centre. I liked that it wasn't in a tourist area. The rooms are small but nicley decorated and I think great for the price. I found the staff really helpful with recommendations and directions. I would most certainly stay here again when in Amsterdam!

<Content>The worst hotel I ever stayed in We stayed at hotel V this week-end and it was a truly terrifying experience!First, when we got to Amsterdam quite early on Saturday, it took us almost 40 minutes to get to the suburb where the hotel is located and actually find the property. Walking to the hotel, we were shaken by the rows of century-old council houses, done up in bad taste, only to find out that our 4 star Design Hotel, was one of them. When we got there, we were told to come back later as check-in time was 2:00 PM and we couldn't stay in the area, because everything was so lacklustre, lugubrious, and felt unsafe. Then when we returned in the afternoon, we had to bring our bags up the 2 floors through a cramped and shappy staircase. The room, when we finally got to it, gave us shivers. The 1970s decor, the open shower, the cold and the noise from non-existant insulation. As a grand finale, the view from the (shared) balcony was ironically pittyful rather than pituresque. Simply traumatising landscapes!Finally, to top it all, we were literally thrown out of the room at 11AM by room service, after a tasteless breakfast, and the lady at the reception when we checked out (probably a senior manager) was despicable: a disgrace, in one word.In a nutshell, there is nothing to make up for any of the numerous drawbacks of this hotel. It's a sacrilege to recommend this hotel as a Design Hotel, in Amsterdam, close to everything.I am terribly dissapointed by this (costly) experience.

<Content>Depressing location, lacklustre hotel We'd booked this hotel on the strength of a review in Time Out's Amsterdam and had high hopes of a 'jewel' of a hotel in a quiet location.It's situated in a small row of 1950's shops - the sort in England which would be behind a council estate with a launderette and a Spar convenience store. So our hearts rather sank when we arrived.The receptionist insisted on taking the full cost of the stay (450 euros) from us as soon as we arrived. Strange. Why was that?Then we went up to our room (no help) up four floors on a tiny narrow staircase - very scruffy indeed and somewhat unpleasant.Our room was quite light but cramped. It was obviouisly formerly a 1950s flat rather cheaply built that had been redecorated rather than rebuilt. It was done in a modernist way but couldn't hide the cheap shower and the plastic sheeting on the beds. My daughter just burst out crying.This might have been alright in the heart of the old centre as an interesting alternative to a traditiional hotel but it's out of town suburban location was rather depressing. I don't know what it's like in the evening - we left immediately but had to forfeit a night's cost. The receptionist was phlegmatic about this - 'Perhaps it wasn't for you.' But we did feel that the website was misleading in projecting a clean, high standard, inspiring hotel.Don't stay here if you are looking for anywhere central. Posibly good for the conference centre. But not for us.

<Content>SImple yet perfect Stayed here for 2 nights last week (2nd-4th October). After wandering around like a fool for half an hour in the wrong direction eventually found the hotel. Please note this was my fault. If i could read a map i'd be fine.The hotel is very welcoming and relaxed which makes check-in very easy. Staff were friendly without being overly-friendly or overly-cold. Up the steep stairs we found our room which was clean, neat and very well decorated. As with previous reports people may find the beds slightly soft but at least there are no springs drilling into your back.Breakfast was trypical Continental but it was of a good standard. The breakfast room was very nicely laid out and was funky, if that's an appropriate word to use.The hotel is about 15 mintues away from the centre on the number 4 tram. We found this fine as it gets away from the hustle and bustle of the City centre. A cab back at night cost anything between 10 and 15 Euros.Fantastic hotel for the price.

<Content>Outstanding -- great ambiance and superb customer service! An absolute gem of a botique hotel. So far our batting average with hotels has been 100% thanks to the web and good research. The Hotel V is a minimalistéˆ¥æªš dream -- from the classic Louis Poulsen artichoke chandelier hanging over our bed to the sleek, teak shelving in the bathroom to its terrazzo shower and floor. The staff was wonderful, oh so hip and helpfuléˆ¥?and the breakfastséˆ¥?(The measure by which I generally judge a property)éˆ¥?were fantastic -- complete with my new favorite vacation toast topping (used to be just Nutella) now itéˆ¥æªš Nutella with hagelslag (chocolate sprinkles). Yeah, I know, seems a bit redundant, and oh so inappropriate for breakfast, but when on vacation, foods and their corresponding day part become irrelevant. Furthermore, Hotel V resides in a perfect neighborhood setting from which we set out each day for our adventures of discovery.

<Content>A stylish hotel for a perfect stay! Just returned from a one-night stay in Amsterdam, sunday to monday this week.I read some reviews here and yes, Iéº“am not disappointed at all.The staff was so friendly, the room small, but stylish and clean,the breakfast very good.The fastest way by public transport is the tram 4 to Rias station, it stops around the corner from the hotel at Vrijhejtslan, in a mainly residential area with no other hotels around.I feel safe all the time, also at night and I éº“am alone on travel.My room was on the top level, wooden floor, shower, booked for around 80.-- EUROS BB, ok so far, by german consolidator Hotel---No elevator as earlier announced, the stairs narrow but the staff was very helpful and asked if I need some help, but no problem for me.Around ten minutes by tram to the Dam, the city center.The chance for another stay at Hotel V is high!.

<Content>Beautiful, stylish  I and my sister truly enjoyed our stay at Hotel V, beautiful, stylish and simplicity everything is in Hotel V. When we arrived by taxi you will be shocked that the location in residential address but the moment you enter the hotel you will fall in love with everything. Good Breakfast , great service, you can check your email free, cleanliness of the hotel V rated as 5 star service and very convenient to the main tourist attraction area by taking 1 TRAM to go to Amsterdam Central which will only take you 10 to 15 minutes. As a hotelier working in 5 star boutique hotel I am very impressed with Hotel V. We will definately come back and stay at Hotel V and recommend Hotel V to all our friends.

<Content>Nice rooms, great staff At first, I was disappointed with Hotel V because it seemed further away from central Amsterdam then I would have liked. But I came to see that as an asset - it was nice spending time in a real neighborhood rather than with tourists, and it was a 5 or 10 min train ride into Amsterdam proper, so it was still quite convenient. The staff was wonderful, though. On my 2nd to last night, I got food poisoning, and various members of the staff took turns entertaining my boyfriend (who didn't want to go too far because of my illness, but also didn't want to spend the whole of his last day in the city cooped up in a hotel room) and helping him locate things like chicken soup and juice for me. They also made up breakfast boxes for us when we had to leave early the next morning. They were very caring. The only undesirable thing about Hotel V was that there is no elevator, so you had to carry up all your luggage through as many as 4 flights of narrow stairs, but I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Lovely, stylish affordable hotel in a residential area of Amsterdam My husband  I stayed here in mid December 2005. We went to Amsterdam for a long weekend  decided to try something further from the centre, as whenever we did that (on our budget) it was always disappointing. We were pleasantly surprised by Hotel V. Although it was a tiny bit tricky to find at first after we stepped off the tram, a hint in our one recent guidebooks saying we wouldn't miss the purple front doors gave it away.The staff were very friendly  helpful. Although when we did ask with help to find somewhere to eat locally (meaning less than a 5 minute walk) the staff never seemed to know, each time he/she said they didn't know because they didn't live in the area... But we managed to find a great Mexican restaurant not too far away by ourselves for our 1st meal (we arrived late on a Friday night). I can't recall the street names anymore, but if you turn left out of the hotel  follow it to the main intersection/junction with the tram lines, turn LEFT (you'd be following that main road towards the city centre, not towards the congress/conference centre). Up a few blocks it's on the right-hand side of the street. Very tasty!Our room at Hotel V was fine. Our bed was great, large  comfy. But the shower/bathroom was a bit strange. The lighting was a bit too subdued  when in the shower one could hardly see. Also, there was a bit of mould growth on the walls in the shower. I think it was mainly because they had only painted the walls in the cubicle (no tiles). Or maybe perhaps they had forgotten to use the special kitchen/bathroom paint. But the amount of mould wasn't gross or anything, just a bit baffling.The soundproofness of the rooms could have been better. In a small hotel it's really important to have appropriate soundproofing both to other rooms  the street. It was not very good at Hotel V, so either travel with a group there so hopefully you'll know your neighbours or be aware it won't be quiet when others are awake or traipsing by your room.We stayed here because we wanted a nice, clean  economical hotel. It fit the bill on all of those areas so I would recommend it.

<Content>unique, intimate and Dutch My stay was congress (physicians) related.I rented the entire hotel for my group. First visit of the hotel in April, congress in October 2005.Overall:hotel built in typical Dutch residential areatherefore a home transformed into a hotel.only two single rooms slightly too small for it to really enjoyable.all other rooms very bright and with the basic comfort needed.only don't expect a room to spend time in.the room is for your overnight rest and your shower. the rooms are well maintained and clean!Staff:Forecoming, friendly  experienced staff who clearly like what they're doing. They go out of their way to suite your wishes,Amsterdam is their city,Netherlands their country.That's reflected in how you're treated and how they inform you on questions you may have regarding possibilities in going out, dining, excursions. If you prefer surfing the web, a computer is at your free disposal in the lobby or the latest magazines on the Amsterdam scene are at the desk.Breakfast:as Dutch as breakfast can be,toast,various breads,eggs,various meats,cheese,sweets,muesli etc.Coffee,tea,OJ or other juices on request. The location is cute too.Don't expect luxury,it's kept simple but welcoming and with a view on unique design.The lobby:it's a transformed living room.a little fire is always on,candles add to the ambiance, a sofa invites to read your magazine should the weather prevent you from going out.Location:10 minutes walk to congress center or 2 minutes by tram.Tram station just around the corner. Ideal for congress stays.To the city center it's approx a 15minutes tram ride, no change of lines necessary.Railway Station at congress center,from there a 10minutes ride to airport.(depending on train connection of course)Other:My guests were surprized at first.They expected a typical hotel.It's not.It's clearly a former home that became a hotel with a special touch of design. You may hear the shower of your neighbour,you may hear them coming back. But with a great city at your feet,with the tram station right within reach,with a staff that will not spare in effort to make your stay memorable,it's a place you might want to check out.

<Content>Very pleasant stay Dear traveler,If you are looking for a pleasant hotel in Amsterdam, do consider Hotel V.It's not expensive, clean and well managed. The rooms are Up to date but modest. The hotel has a nice 'lounge' look.They rent bikes, which is the best way to go abouit town in Amsterdam.Walking to the towncenter is quite a walk but there is plenty of public transport.The hotel is near de Pijpdistrict, a nice neighbourhood in Amsterdam with lot's of bars and restaurants.If the weahter is nice you can have breakfast in the garden-----

<Content>Just as I imagined from the web page Hotel V's web page description is one of the most accurate I have ever seen. It was exactly as I had imagined and possibly even better (more atmosphere than its unlcuttered image might imply). Clean and bright, helpful, friendly staff and really stylish yet comfortable lounge and breakfast areas. Good buffet breakfast too (great Dutch bread rolls). My room on 4th floor (no lift and steep stairs) was clean, comfy and mercifully free of hotel carpet! Bathroom though small was just fine and shower had plenty of hot water, good pressure and was actually much more spacious than the size of the bathroom would imply. This hotel's location won't suit everyone as it is a good 10 min tram ride (stop just a couple of minutes away) from the centre, however for me it was great - quiet yet still very convenient for both city centre and airport/train. Not too much choice of good eating places in the immediate vicinity (big supermarket just round the corner!) so better to look for food more centrally. I would definitely stay there again - very good value and free internet access too!

<Content>Enjoyable and Very European We spent four very pleasant nights at the Hotel V. I was attending a conference near the RAI Conference Center and it was very convenient for my business purposes. However, overall the hotel is near lots of restaurants and a grocery store, which was super handy, and is walkable (a decent walk, but doable) to the Centrum and to the Van Gogh and Riljksmuseum. I recommend that you do as the Amsterdammers do and rent a bike or ride the SUPER WONDERFUL trams that go all over the city. The one that stops just yards away from the hotel goes straight downtown.While the rooms are not huge and my husband and I shared two twin beds pushed together, the hotel was otherwise charming, very clean and very...well, Dutch, which is exactly what we wanted. The beds had crisp white sheets with down comforters that made you want to sleep the day away. The bathrooms were spotless and included all the modern conveniences (e.g. hair dryer, great-smelling shampoos and body washes). Also, the water pressure was to die for.Breakfast was fantastic. Breads, cold cuts, jams, fruit, cereal. Anything you'd want short of a Denny's Grand Slam. There was free internet access in the lobby, which was great for checking in at home and making our traveling less worry-filled.The stairs are narrow and steep, but that's not unusal in European hotels. If you don't like stairs or are hauling some major luggage, just request a lower floor.The people at the desk were fantastic. We bugged them with dozens of questions about where to eat, what to see, etc., and they seemed thrilled to help us. To have that kind of warm reception more than made up for the inconvenience of the stairs. So, we'll definitely return, and I'm thrilled to have taken a chance on Hotel V, instead of reserving a room at the boring old Hyatt where my co-workers stayed.

<Content>far from the action I stayed at the Hotel V with a friend and it was a good hotel, maybe slightly above average. Price OK (Euro 130/night) but here are the drawbacks... 1. No elevator and you have have to carry your luggage up some steep stairs (especially if you are on the third or fourth floors); 2. Simply an older Amsterdam apartment building that has been renovated; 3. Pretty far from the Center (but convenient if you are going to a convention at the RAI). If the price was under Euro 100 it would move my ratings up a bit. Probably will try someplace else the next time.

<Content>a youth hostel - not a design hotel We read about the Hotel in some style guides and the web site was nice so we book two double rooms for two couples for christmas shopping.The hotel is out of the center, it takes some stops with the tram.The owners invested some money and a lot of IKEA furniture to turn this small house in a design hotel - in truth it is more like a youth hostel with some nice style ideas.The room we stayed was the smallest double room i ever had and not very cosy. The bed was awful and the bathroom had the size of a towel. The price of 120 Euros was a joke. After seeing the room we did understand why you have to pay on check in....The room of our friend was a bit bigger but not very much better.Quite nice and stylish are the public areas like the breakfast room and the small lobby.I cannot recommend this hotel (regarding the price, location and their presentation as design hotel).

<Content>a terrible experience whe want at V for a nice and romantic week end with my boyfriend...on the web site, the hotel seemed to be the perfect place...but once there, what a surprise!!!the room, at the fourth floor without elevator whas small, with little windows and an awfull view on old flats. The all thing looked like an hospital room. And, last but not least: the bed! not a double, but too small beds. Whe asked the reception to do something and guess what? the just put the too beds together...so romantic! so professional when you kown the clients are obliged too pay the bill (400 euros / three nights!) before seeing the room! taken for fools, whe decided to live. Whe proposed the hotel to pay them the first night and that they give us back our money for the too left. They refused, pretending that the room whas supposed to be a triple and blablabla. So whe have lost 400 euros but had a wonderfull time in another hotel. A real one!
