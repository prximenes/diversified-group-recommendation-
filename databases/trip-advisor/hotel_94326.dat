<Content>Will Be Back!! Picked this hotel from tripadvisor reviews. Thanks everyone for your input. Hotel was excellent. My husband and I were upgraded to a suite for free. Room was VERY spacious, king bed awesome. We stayed on 14th floor. Great views..... All staff very friendly. Great location. Skip hotel restaurant, breakfast not worth the price. Went to North End to the Cantina Italiano, incredible food and service. Will go back.. No negatives..

<Content>Fantastic Hotel All Around I usually stay at Hiltons when I travel for business because of the sheer number of them available; there's a good chance there's a Hilton near the customer I'm traveling to see.This visit, I dragged my husband with me since this month was busy as far as business travel goes and I was tired of being away. (Dragging hubby with me is sort of selfish - it makes the business trip go easier for me) :)What a gorgeous hotel! We stayed at the Hilton Boston Financial District, and being a Hilton Honors member, we received complimentary breakfast coupons for the two days we were there. That was a nice touch.Check-in was mostly hassle-free, though our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so we had to wait about an hour and a half. We had lunch in the hotel restaurant CaliTerra to kill time, which ended up being a really nice treat. I had a personal pizza for lunch, while my husband had a grilled turkey panini that he enjoyed. Upon checking in, the room was immaculate. Gorgeous furnishings, impressively-made bed (I love the Hilton Heavenly beds), beautiful bathroom fixtures/decor; this hotel was beautiful all the way around. There was the bed, a nice sitting area with a TV/armoire, and a comfortable chair and desk.Housekeeping offered turn-down service. They freshened your room as well. That's a great touch, to be honest! To see the bed (which is inviting anyway) dressed for you to snuggle deep into the down comforter with the cold weather howling outside ... it's almost irresistible...Room service was actually the best I've had in a hotel anywhere. I had a fantastic spinach tortellini in a cheese sauce, while my husband had a frou-frou pizza, and we split a caesar salad. Frankie the Yankie delivered our food and was so funny to chat with. The kitchen was actually quick to deliver our meal, I was pleasantly surprised.The workout room was beautifully equipped, though the equipment needed a good cleaning. There were three Precor brand treadmills, two Precor brand elliptical runners, and two recumbent-style Precor brand bikes. Each had an entertainment system with headphones so you could either listen to music or watch TV while you worked out. There were also some free weights and a few pieces of universal-style gym equipment. Unfortunately, there was virtually no room to stretch on the floor or do yoga, though there was a yoga mat. There was also no water within the gym; you had to step out of the gym (take your room key with you) to drink from the water fountain outside the gym.The hotel was located a few blocks from the State Street T, so it was a short walk away, though dragging your suitcase through downtown Boston was tough, with the crappy ruddy narrow sidewalks. The State Street T can take you virtually anywhere you need to go so the location was great.I would definitely stay at this hotel again.-Jen

<Content>Yes, we liked it,too. After many years it was wonderful to come back to Boston.We enjoyed this hotel and it麓s location very much.As lots of others have said already, all stuff is great and helpful. The concierge Charles went out of his way to help us with tickets.The lobby was a little small and got crowded one monrning whena larger group of people arrived.Our room was spacious and the bed very comfy.There was only one problem which was a little letdown:there was a connecting door to the room next to us and at around4 o麓clock in the morning people were talking so loud, that we could not sleep any longer. It happend again once more at about the same time. Real bad.But other than that we liked it here.

<Content>Nice, Small Hotel Hi. I recently stayed at The Hilton Boston, Financial District last night, 05 December 2008  had a very good experience. The front desk agent, Lourdes, was kind  friendly, as were both Concierges....Charles was excellent with directions  a super nice guy! My room (732) had an amazingly comfortable king bed!!---best hotel bed ever--even tops my Four Seasons/Ritz Stays!, nice, roomy bathroom with excellent water pressure  great hot water, as well as La Source Crabtree  Evelyn bath amenties---nice smelling soaps  creams. The room also had very high ceilings, was quite spacious, offered a large desk  roomy closet with robe, iron/board, etc. The lobby is small, but boutique-y,  has two seperate entrances. I had room service for breakfast, which was good, except for a runny egg--as promised, it arrived within 30 minutes to my room (exactly). Christina, the in-room dining order taker, called me after I finished my meal just to make sure everything was well---very nice touch--they never call at luxury properties, so suprised when they called. She was very polite  a pleasure to speak with! The elevators were a little dirty, with some chipped wood (no big deal), but the room was in good shape...the tub looked ever so slightly brown(nothing big enough to call for), but I'm sure that was just usual wear--tear from guests. The lobby had a coffee/tea set-up in the AM, which was also nice. Good location for Fanieul Hall, etc, but about a 20-25 min. walk to Newbury Street, Beacon Hill, etc. Be sure to visit Flour Bakery, Neptune Oyster,  Stephanie's on Newbury..all great places to dine! Boston's street layout is super super confusing, so I was lost quite a bit, so be careful when navigating the city! Warmest Winter Wishes, PW, New York, NY 06 December 2008.

<Content>Great hotel The hotel is in a great location. A few blocks from Quincy market and a short subway ride to Newbury street (very nice and clean subway system). The suite was big and very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is an affordable parking garage close by (approximately 4 blocks) at One Postal Square. It is about $9 a day. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Not the best, but... I wasn't entirely impressed with this Hilton. I stayed here during Greenbuild, a large convention held down at the BCEC. This hotel is located in the financial district, which is convenient to both business and tourist attractions. There are also several pubs on Broad Street (I recommend Mr Dooleys!) and a Panera Bread nearby which are all much more affordable and better food than the restaurant in the hotel.The furnishings are very nice, with granite-topped tables and a comfortable bed. The staff was friendly and helpful, from the check-in desk to the cleaning staff that helped me manuever my large suitcase into the elevator on my way out!However, beyond that, there were several things about my room that made my stay less enjoyable. The heating system did not seem to blow warm air despite much fiddling with the thermostat, and the fan would turn on and off very erratically which woke me up throughout the night. There were two windows in my room which would have been very nice, except that they leaked cold air into the room like a sieve. The heavy drapes worked well at blocking the drafts, but it was still very difficult to keep the room warm (and this was in November!). Thankfully there was a down comforter on the bed! The room itself was pretty small too. Not uncomfortably so, but I had a hard time finding a place to put the luggage rack with my extra-large suitcase on it where it wasn't in the way.The bathroom was large, but there was only one hook for towels in the entire room. I would up having to hang my toiletry kit on the handtowel loop, which was kind of awkward. I also conducted a test of their towel reuse program (I try to do this in every hotel I stay in), and marked one of my towels with make-up before hanging it on the one hook. The next day the towels were folded and put away, and the one I had marked was not there. So much for being green. (Although they did convert to CFL bulbs in all the light fixtures, but the inefficiency of the windows probably negated any energy savings they might have had.)If you are traveling to Boston anytime soon, there may also still be construction on Franklin Street, complete with jackhammers and backhoes starting up at 7 am!Lastly, I would note that the toiletries and soaps provided reminded me of my grandmother... very floral and perfumey, and not pleasant to use.Next time I visit Boston, I will be trying another hotel.

<Content>Perfect for a city break This is a large hotel in the heart of Boston's financial district and perfect for roaming the streets of old Boston. Our king bed room was of good size, well appointed and spotlessly clean. The staff were all eager to assist and a refreshing change to some other large city hotels at which we've stayed. One item I should mention; there is no safe in the room. Valuables have to be stored in safe boxes located with the concierge. This is not a problem except for the fact that boxes are limited in size and number. We had a great stay and can recommend this hotel to visitors wanting to see Historic Boston and the walk the Freedom Trail.

<Content>Loved it! My husband and I had a brief weekend trip to Boston last weekend and stayed at the HIlton in the Financial District. What a lovely place. The staff was very pleasant. The rooms were very clean. And the beds were heavenly. The only thing I thought was a little over priced was the $38 a day parking. Nevertheless, we found that parking was expensive everywhere in Boston. The location was perfect. We were close to the Freedom Trail, Quincy Market, and many great places to eat. Need I say more! You can't go wrong with this Hilton Hotel.

<Content>Great choice for first Boston Trip I'm a Hilton Gold VIP and as such have stayed in many Hilton properties. My daughter took a semester off from college and we decided to check out Boston. This hotel was in walking distance from the major stuff, The Common, the Metro (T), waterfront, Fanueil Hall, it was awesome. Had a great room (upgrade because of the Hilton VIP) and everyone was really nice. Comfy beds and friendly staff. What more could you want?

<Content>High class and noisy. For the most part, this hotel meets the expectations of hotels of its class: attentive staff, clean, nice amenities. I thought the Hilton Financial District would cater to business clients. I found instead that the lower floors of the building are a conference center for Northeast University. As a result, my neighbors on both nights were young adults with noisy enthusiasm commensurate with that age. To the hotel's credit, they responded promptly when I asked them to help tone down the noise after hours. For what I was paying for my room, I wanted a more peaceful stay.

<Content>fantastic location, great staff We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights, I can safely say that the room we had was fab. There were 3 of us - two adults and a child and there was plenty of room. All the hotel staff we met were friendly, polite and very helpful. The hotel was really handy for most places in the city - Quincey Market just a 5 minute Walk; Boston Common a 5 minute walk north. We all really loved Boston as it was 'walkable' - we will definitely be back ........and probably to this hotel.

<Content>Rooms are not user friendly The hotel is in a nice location and the staff personnel are helpful and friendly. The rooms, however, leave much to be desired. Our room was a spacious double on the 7th floor. Storage space, however, was sparse. There are only a couple of small drawers, none full-sized. There are no hooks in the bathroom, no make-up mirror, and no shelves for cosmetic bags. The oblong wastebaskets are so narrow they can't hold much. The bathroom had a loud low-flow toilet that took forever to fill. The hotel has an exercise room but it is geared toward cardiac machines and lacks a good assortment of exercise equipment, although it does have free weights. It also seems designed for tall men: I couldn't use the chin-up bar because I could barely reach it!We had stayed at 2 other hotels and 1 BB during this trip, including one other Hilton. The rooms in this hotel seem to have been designed for beauty rather than function. We would not stay here again for that reason.

<Content>Good location to waterfront When I go into Boston, I prefer smaller, charming hotels rather than modern hotels. This one is a mix. The staff was great. There was a small line at registration but it moved rather quickly.The location was actually pretty quite during the weekend. I'm guessing it's buzzing during the week. It is in walking distance to the metro, waterfront and Faneuil Hall. Which translates to plenty of places to eat, drink and be with friends. It's a quick cab to the theatre district and the public garden but you're better off walking during commute hours. The hotel was clean, the decor in my room was lovely with dental modelings, fine drapes and cherry furniture. The linens was above average.. .that's important to me. I would stay at this location again but it does lack a spa.

<Content>Can't praise it enough! It was only a short taxi ride from the airport, and it was also only a short walk to the Aquarium and Quincy Market. I thought it was an unbeatable location. The staff were all pleasant and helpful. The room was wonderfully spacious, so much so that our next Hilton (Chicago) came as a terrible shock. Coming in after a lot of walking on a chilly afternoon, we found the complimentary hot apple cider to be a delightful and much welcomed touch. The room was perfectly clean, with an outsize bathroom. The hotel was quiet, so we got a good sleep. The breakfast was really high-quality ($22 for all you could eat) and dinner was excellent too. I really hope to visit this hotel again.

The manager got us a taxi in the morning because the bellhop left his post for a minute, now that is service. The heated overhang is genius! Would definately stay here again and recommend it to all!

<Content>Worthy of the 4 Star Rating, but if you go, tips to know Great Hotel within walking distance of the North End (Italian [Food] District), Boston Commons (think Central Park), the New England Aquarium, Freedom Trail (Paul Revere's route), and of course, the Ocean.Tips:- Skip the Hotel Restaurant: too many nice less expensive options within a couple blocks. - The Times Irish Pub - good food, very reasonable ($7-$20) - Panera Bread - breakfast egg soufles $4. - Subway (Good for on the run) - Umbria Italian (PIZZA ) Steakhouse (Didn't eat there, but looked pretty fancy.)- Skip the Valet Parking ($38/night): One block North of the Hotel is Valet parking (same place that the Hilton uses!) for cheaper ($18-$34/night).- Don't use the $4.50 Bottled Water (from Italy) in the room, go down to the Hotel Fitness Center for free bottles of Poland Springs (Maine) water.- Don't pay for internet in room! Take your laptop down to the Hotel Library, where Hilton offers complementary wireless through WayPort (or something like that) ISP (for free). Sign up (by going to Google.com, and it will redirect you, follow the prompt), then go up to your room, and the same ISP will let you use it for free until 3PM the following day. (Then just do the same thing again!)- Ask the extremely knowledgeable Concierge questions, and for a local map (The Hilton Map was not touristy, but did give you everything you needed to know about the downtown area.)Enjoy your trip!

<Content>Excellent location and service Spent 3 nights here in October 2008. Couldn't fault room or service we received. The Hilton really is in a great location, only a short walk to Fanuel Hall, the water front, the North End, the Freedom Trail and the subway.Decent sized room that was quiet and comfortable. The only problem (with a small p) was a missing privacy card however this arrived within 5 minutes of contacting housekeeping.The adjoining restaurant served a suberb (but slightly pricy) breakfast, with staff particularly friendly and attentive.Bottom line - doubt you'll find anywhere better as an all round package.

<Content>Great Location, Mediocre Service The Hilton is in a great location. Easy walk to Fanuel Hall, the water front, the North End, the Freedom Trail and the subway. Check-in was convenient. Even though the front desk staff was proficient, it felt insincere. If I spoke Spanish they may have been more personable. They were efficient and polite just enough so you really couldn't complain but you didn't walk away feeling you were a welcome guest either. I am a Hilton Honors Silver member. I asked if that meant anything and it didn't because she didn't offer anything. I asked at the HIlton Boston Airport and got a free upgrade even though I didn't qualify.The hotel room was spacious, the beds very comfortable and the linens nice. If you left the hot water running too long in the shower, the mold on the grout would flake off. Hardly any of the ice machines worked, I had to travel several floors before finding one. The maid staff new there was no ice but obviously didn't report it to management.The A/C was practically non-existent. We called the front desk at 9:00PM to ask for an engineer but one never showed up. The front desk did call and inquire but that was the last of any front desk assistance. We saw the engineer on the elevator in the morning and asked him to check it. The only way we knew he had been there was the thermostat was lower than we left it.In order to use the elevators above floor 4, you need to slide your card. This was not explained at the desk. This hotel was popular with tour buses. Every night, I would find older couples trying to figure out how to get off on their floor. Luckily they were British and Irish and we could communicate. A good example of the lack of customer service.We left a flyer on the door for breakfast the next morning. My traveling companion didn't put the room number on it. The person collecting the cards obviously didn't check for that information. It was that lack of attention that makes this hotel just okay. Luckily we got a corporate rate of $209 a night. If I had paid more, I would have been very disappointed.Even though the hotel was in a great location, I won't return. The service was just mediocre and left me feeling like just another paying customer. If you didn't ask for a service it wasn't offered and if you didn't report a problem, it wasn't addressed. Nothing special.

<Content>Great Stay Like most of the reviews suggest, this is a nice hotel in a great location. I used points and still recieved an upgrade and full breakfast. The room was well appointed, clean, and yes, the bed was very comfortable. The staff was friendly and very helpful. It's true you shouldn't have expectations of a Four Seasons or Ritz, but it is a very good four star hotel.

<Content>Yes, the beds were comfy... We spent two nights here after flying from the UK, before we went off down to Cape Cod.The previous reviews are correct, the rooms are fine but the beds are excellent. We sometimes have a job sleeping after arriving at a holiday destination... not here!Very good location as well, plenty of nightlife around, if you want a smoke try the Irish bar on the corner, it has a big outdoor area.Handy for the seafront and lots of restaurants too.

<Content>Wonderful Stay Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff was extremely friendly and eager to help without even being asked. Got an unexpected room upgrade and were extremely impressed with the decor, cleanliness, and soundproofing. The breakfast buffet was delicious but a little overpriced ($22 for adults, but a bargain for child ($5.50)). Would stay here again and recommend to a friend.

<Content>Great Hilton I am writing this review not because I had any complaint about the Hilton's property but because I think the reviews on this site are slightly misleading. When I read them, I had expected the hotel to be of the level you might expect of a Ritz or a Four Seasons. It isn't, it is just a very good Hilton, showing all the good things of a high end Hilton and no criticisms but just not a five star hotel.The beds are comfy, the bathrooms great, the service fine. The public areas are limited though, which is partly why I don't belive it is a 5 star hotel.The bar next door, Mr Dooleys, was FANTASTIC!!! I can not recommend it highly enough for friendly excellent service and really good Irish breakfasts.

<Content>Comfiest bed ever We arrived at the hotel after a trouble free journey from the UK. The service throughout was excellent. The room was spacious with everything we needed . The bed was so so comfy it was difficult to get up and face the day. The restaurant in the hotel was very good with a wide ranging dinner and breakfast menu. The caesar salad was one of the best I have ever tasted. The hotel was situated within easy walking distance of the Quincy Market area and we would recommend the Old Town Trolley Tour to see the sights and get your bearings.

<Content>Excellent value We booked this at an excellent rate through unpackaged.com and we unsure as to what we would find. It proved to be just right for our 3 night stay in Boston being a very easy walk to most of the sights and just a short walk from Aquarium subway station. If you like Irish Pubs then this is the place to be - we would particularly recommend Mr Dooleys which is virtually next-door to the Hilton. Our room was a decent size and well appointed, but don't expect a view for the price we paid! The bed was very comfortable and the A/C worked well. Staff were efficient and courteous and I would particularly like to thank the conceirge who stored our luggage for a couple of days whilst we took a trip to Washington.

<Content>Everything was excellent Our family of four stayed here for two nights, a Thursday and Friday. Everything went smoothly from check-in to check-out. Valet parking was very quick, there was an envelope that had a note from the reservations clerk and all the tickets that were promised with our package included. We didn't have to ask for anything. Breakfast was very good and served in a pleasant setting. The hotel was located in a good spot for Faneuil hall, the aquarium, and as a starting point for walks around town. Our room was excellent - it had two rooms, lots of space, very nice furnishings and it was in very good condition.

<Content>Impressed Small but very well appointed room  lovely, spacious bathroom with lots of space for toiletries on granite countertop. Loved the buffet - we were going to go out for breakfast because of the price ($22) but after a lazy start because of the wonderful, comfortable bed, (although pillows softer than I like) we changed our minds - so glad we did. The service was a bit patchwork at times but the food quality was good. Unlike many hotel buffets, the food actually tasted! Flavorsome fruit, wonderful smoked salmon  delicious lemon honey, creamy HOT scrambled egg - well worth the price.

<Content>Good location, clean, but spendy! Hotel's lcoation is convenient and close to a lot of things to do. Hotel is in an old buidling with nicely done rooms. The lobby area was small and 'felt' crowded. Though the room was small, the room did contain a King size bed, sitting chair w/Ottoman and business desk. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Even with the expected higher rates of a downtown location, I found the price per night to be expensive for the room I had. With the hotels close proximity to restaurants and its' downtown location, garbage trucks were out in force beginning around 4:30AM emptying the dumpsters in the area. It was quite loud. And beginning around 6AM the food and service delivery trucks for the restaurants began making their deliveries. From the hotel it is a short walk to a variety of restaurants and bars. Also, it is close to Qunicy Market, Faneuil Hall, Old State House and shopping. For something a little different. we took a water taxi to Logan airport instead of regular taxi. The water taxi can be picked up behind the Harbor Place Hotel (about two blocks from the Hilton), rate is $10, and it drops you off on airport property where you can pick up a bus shuttle to the terminal. It provided great views of Boston.

<Content>nice hotel This was the perfect location for a weekend getaway for me and my girlfriend. Hotel was very clean and beds were adorned with a down comforter and 6 down pillows! The heavy drapes were very good at keeping out the sunlight which allowed us to sleep in a little longer. There are tons of bars and shops within walking distance including Quincy Market and the waterfront attractions. Subway (T) is a few blocks away and easily accessible.The Concierge was helpful and the Bell hops were on the ball and abundant . The front desk was OK but I never got the warm and fuzzies from them. Room service was quick with a breakfast of fresh berries, muffins and hot coffee. The North End was a fairly short T ride to North Station and a quick walk from there. A must if you like homemeade italian cooking. The whole area feels like a street carnival on a weekend night. Lots of fun.Overall I would definitely stay here again. The only problem we experienced was the constant whirling of the AC unit outside below the window. If you remember, ask for a room away from the hotels AC unit. It's not a huge problem or deal breaker, just more of a nuisance.

<Content>Not a pleasant experience Our stay here was very unpleasant. Reservation staff was not at all helpful in answering questions about parking. Our room was above a very noisy air conditioning unit hat ran 24 hours a day. We never had any housekeeping service. When we returned and found that our room had not been cleaned, we complained and they offered to bring us what we needed. We asked for drinking glasses. They brought up 2 soaking wet large wine glasses that had clearly just been rinsed - not washed - because they were still filthy. I would not stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Good Choice for a Weekend Stay We stayed at the Hilton in the Financial District for one night after our cruise ended in Boston. We wanted a nice hotel with a reasonable rate for a weekend night in a downtown location. This was a good choice.We got a room on the top floor but it did not have much of a view. The bed was extremely comfortable with numerous pillows.Their location is excellent. Within walking distance of most downtown attractions and several subway stops. After dinner we felt very safe walking back to the hotel after dark.Our only complaint is that the front desk would not give us the room key until exactly 3:00pm, their check-in time. I approached the desk at 2:50 and they made us wait the ten minutes until the official check-in time.Their concierge, John, was very helpful. He made us reservations at a great Italian restaurant in the North End (Saraceno's) and even printed our airline boarding passes for us.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Having never been to Boston before was looking for a better hotel at a good price. When this came up as the best price was a little worried about the location from looking at the online map, BUT THE LOCATION IS GREAT. We could, and did, walk to everywhere.Not sure why it was so cheap (was a weekend stay) but it was one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in. The room was very good size by any standard. The financial district seemed safer than other parts of the city, light traffic. Subway and harbor less than 5 minute walk away, shops and restaurants, bars all around. We skipped the hotel valet parking @ $38 a day and found all-day weekend parking for $9.00 per day, 2 blocks away at the Postal Square garage. We never took the car out for the whole weekend. Never eat at the hotel but breakfast was cheap at the nice Panera Bread 1 block away. Hotel bar nice for an upscale place for a drink. Staff were great with advice and maps on where to go and all very polite.For a person that travels a lot I don't easily give out excellent marks but in my opinion they earned it especially at the rate we paid.If I come back to Boston this is where I will stay again.

<Content>Comfortable hotel Convenient location Stayed here for 5 Lovely Nights wished it could have been more. The beds are extremely comfortable and went to sleep easily unlike many hotel beds. The room and bathroom were both a very good size. Both were extremely well kept and clean. We had a corner room which i believe is slighlty larger then a regular room and has more natural light. The hotel is near quincy market and south station ect and most of the main attractions are wthin a five min walk. For breakfast quciny market has some options, there are a couple of near by delis and a place called panera bread has wonderful tasting bagels.The only thing about the hotel is that it is not very well light and as we waled at night form the station it took a little to find even though it has 2 entrances. Also for a modern room a flatscreen tv would have fitted in a bit better but the one we had worked fine.Overall i would completley come back and would stay here over any of the hotels near the pru as i feel that this is a nicer location in boston to stay esp for fisrst time visitors.

<Content>Average and Expensive I spent two nights at the Hilton in the Boston Financial District. It definitely had it's good points and bad points. The entire staff was very polite and helpful. The hotel was in a great location, and my coworkers and I were able to walk to dinner and shopping nearby. My room had a beautiful comfortable bed, but...My room was on the 4th floor directly above a giant air conditioning unit on a lower roof of the hotel. The unit hummed all night and I regretted not packing a sleep aid! I asked about using a business center to print out my boarding passes. The business center (2 computers and 1 printer) charged a minimum of $10 to get online. If a patron is paying $349 per night, being able to use a business center to print out a boarding pass and check flight status should be free and not at an additional charge. I also found the hotel a bit dark because of the decor (mustard yellow  green patterned carpeting).Overall, it was adequate lodging for a business trip, but I've stayed in better for less.

<Content>Good hotel, but some probelms I stayed here for three nights. The facility was fine. Large and comfortable room. Spotless bathroom. However, front desk staff was a problem.When I checked in a very rude woman was working the desk. We ended up having an argument over earning HiltonHHonors points. I was tired after a long and frustrating plane ride so I let the matter drop for the moment.Upon my check in the hotel placed a $300 hold on my credit card. I was not told of the hold by the rude font desk clerk so it came as an embarrassing surprise later that night when I tried to use my card to pay for dinner at a local restaurant.I ate dinner in the hotel restaurant the second night. The food and service were just fine, until it came time to pay the bill. I do not like to make charges to my room, so I put my credit card in the bill folder and waited for the server to make the charge. The server never came back; I assume he thought I was going to charge the meal to my room. I ended up having to charge the dinner to my room.Finally, on my last day I decided to make a complaint to the hotel management. The same rude woman from my check in was working the desk with another clerk. The rude woman and the other clerk actually tried to tell me that no manager was available to take my complaint. I held my ground and insisted that I speak with a manager, even if they had to call one from home. No surprise, they were suddenly able to find a manager, who turned out to be the Director of Revenue. I assume that is a fancy title for Sales Manager. The manager was actually very sympathetic and was able to resolve my complaints to my satisfaction.Overall, the hotel was a nice place to stay and I would recommend it to others.

<Content>Nice but.... Hotel is clean and is in a great location for business and tourism. We stayed for two night for a friends wedding. The staff was very nice. You had to use your room key to use the elevator and lavatories on the lobby level, which was a pain, but it also keeps the hotel secure. Our room was nice and big (bigger than some other hotels in the area). We had only one complaint. We had problems with our toilet, it ran and clogged for no apparent reason. They supposedly fixed it to only clog again. Our friends who also stayed at the hotel has toilet problems as well. We would go back if they can fix their plumbing issues!!!

<Content>close to the markets I stayed at the hilton for 2 nights and this hotel is very close to the market where all the tourists go for a meal/bar shopping/entertainment. room was very nice larger room/nice bed... the usual hilton style... only disappointing thing was the view out of the window... the air con! also you had to use your room card for the lift... i am not sure if this buliding is also for resident... but with 4 cases and trying to do the lift was difficult. Otherwise great hotel central located, near a subway and near lots of places to eat and drink at night.

<Content>A big hit with all the family (adults) Date: June 6, 2008Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, Bath UKWe used the hotel for a reunion involving family members travelling from Milwaukee, Bath and Hebden Bridge - all arriving on different dates. The hotel exceeded our expectations. A great location close to the T, waterfront, good restaurants and shops. No car required!The concierge service was excellent. Unobtrusive but efficient restaurant staff led to a relaxed atmosphere.Rooms were clean and spacious.If we had to make one negative observation - an ounce of charm on the part of the reception staff would not go amiss.We have no reservation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Warm and inviting, great location Stayed at the Boston Hilton Financial District over Memorial Day weekend and was very pleased with the experience. From the time I arrived to the time I checked out, all staff members were pleasant, courteous and efficient. Check in was quick and painless. My room, on the 8th floor, had a nice view and was very spacious. The room and bath were both spotless and the common areas were in great shape as well.The bed and pillows were terrific and I got a great night's sleep. The location is very convenient to transportation and sight seeing and there were plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from nearby. I thought that being in the financial district, it would be dead during the weekend but there was plenty of activity around. Some of the lunch/breakfast places were closed, but many of the restaurants were open.Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic hotel Spent 4 nights in the Hilton from 7th- 11th May and everything about this hotel was fantastic. We were on the 12th floor which was at the side of the hotel and had a partial view of the ocean. The room was huge, really high ceilings, massive comfortable bed, great toiletries etc. Staff were great, really helpful and friendly, and the food in the hotel restaurant was also excellent. The hotel also has a 24 hour taxi service which is really useful for getting to the airport. However you wont need to use a taxi to see the city of Boston, its really comact and easy to get around. The people are warm and welcoming and I would really recommend a visit to the city and definitely a stay at The Hilton.

<Content>Unremarkable I am finding more and more that the Hilton chain is also inconsistent. Some of them look great and treat you well. I stayed at this one only to try a new hotel in Boston after the Langham and the Westin Waterfront. This hotel was bland and unexciting. Although the staff do treat you nicely and try to remember your name (appreciated), the room (two doubles) was small and there was no view and did not have a nice hotel feel to it. I suppose it may be too much to ask a downtown hotel. There seemed to be many priceline guests, and so though it is in a business district, the clientele seemed less businesslike.The Langham around the corner had more of an upscale feel to it. Adequate, but I probably would either go back to the Langham or try something else.

<Content>Very nice hotel, nice location, friendly staff I stayed there with my Hilton points, so did not pay, however the hotel is absolutely nice, way above the average hiltons, in a great location, and with super-efficient staff. When I arrived I asked if there was a microwave oven in the room, they said no but they immediately brought one in the room. The room was spacious, modern. The bathroom was very nice, with a very nice shower and bath tub. The porter and valet service (quite expensive, true) are super-efficient, really great. I don't know about other hotels in Boston but I would definitely go there again.

<Content>Very nice Was awarded the room thru Priceline for $135/night. Was hoping for the Intercontinental but this was fine. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Upgraded one night's stay to a suite for an extra $75 - my husband's birthday. The suite was nice, very spacious, but considering the inconvenience of changing rooms I wouldn't do it again. The non-suite room we moved to for the last two nights of our stay was a very large room so it would have sufficed perfectly. Extremely clean. We spent very little time in the room. I loved the proximity of everything in the Financial District. We bought Trolley tickets but got off at stop 4 and just walked everywhere - and I am not a walker. With our suite upgrade were free tickets to the buffet that they charge $19.95. Do not waste your money on the buffet. The food is unbelievable expensive in the restaurant. There is a Panera Bread just down the road and plenty of little shops to get a bite to eat. Quincy Market, North End all within walking distance. There is a restaurant on the way to Quincy Hall, Bertucci's, that was magnificant - not so expensive and casual but I would go there again in a minute.

<Content>Fantastic staff, great location It was a pleasure to arrive at the doors of this hotel. We were met by efficient and friendly porters and quickly processed through check in. As it was our engagement celebration, I had asked for a card to be placed in the room for my partner and the staff went out of their way to make our stay special. Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were spacious and impecably clean. The breakfast buffet was great, as there were a lot of healthy items as well as the usual pancakes  muffins etc.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues. You are guaranteed to have a stress free stay here.

<Content>Great Stay at the Hilton I am a Hilton Honors member and was treated like royalty at this hotel. My room was upgraded to a two-room suite and when I arrived in my room I got a phone call from the front desk asking me if everything was to my liking. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the hotel was close to everything (and easy to find from the highway.) There were quite a few drunks after last call, who weren't very respectful of the other patrons and the hotel itself, but this did not detract from my stay. Valet parking was pricey.The breakfast buffet, which was complimentary because of my Hilton points, was delicious.Service overall was great -- a rarity today.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Incredible This place was awesome! My boyfriend surprised me with a weekend getaway for my birthday. Everyone we met was friendly and helpful. They do have valet for $38 a night however we chose to park one block down in a garage thinking it would be cheaper and it ended upbeing $44...should have gone with the valet. When we first arrived we checked in and realized we didn't have a smoking room...we knew we would definitely want to smoke the more champagne we drank so we called the front desk and they already had a key made for us by the time we took the elevator down to the lobby. The beds I would have to say put the trip over the top!!! They are specially made from Serta for the Hilton and we have already gone to the hilton website to buy the bed and down mattress covering...you'll see what I mean when you get there,,,incredible. The hotel is conveniently located to the aquarium, quincy market, tons of pubs and restaurants. I would definitely go there again and would recommend it to anyone I know that wants to spend a little extra for the little details and finer things....even the shampoo is terrific!! Everyone should try this place at least once. After this trip, we are considering a move to Boston!!

We were harassed by security in the middle of the night for no reason and then again the next moring by a mini bar checker???? Very weird I have never even heard of such a person, i refused to let him in since we were checking out and he would be able to come in right after. When we complained at check out they could have cared less!!!If you are looking to come to the city to have a fun girls get away weekend look somewhere else!!!!!

<Content>Nice Place, Attentive Staff My wife and I stayed at the hotel for four nights. We had some trouble finding the place with all the crazy streets that comprise Boston, but were very happy with the place once we settled in. The hotel is conveniently located reasonably near the State and Aquarium stops on the subway line (which is the best way to get around in Boston), Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Government Center, and the Boston Aquarium (excellent and well worth the trip). If the weather is reasonable, it is also within a nice walk of Boston Common, Boston Garden (Make Way for Ducklings), and upscale shopping on Newberry and Boylston Streets. Our room was very comfortable in the nicely refurbished 1920's Art Deco building. The hotel had an excellent small restaurant with a fine buffet breakfast - free to Hilton Gold members. The hotel staff were uniformly attentive and pleasant. We enjoyed several nearby restaurants: Sakurabana (Japanese, of course), Black Rose (Irish Pub), Legal Seafoods (nearest is at Long Wharf), in addition to many eating options at Faneuil Hall. I would happily return to this location.

<Content>Fantastic beds! Just back from having spent a week in this hotel. Cannot complain about anything! Its in a quiet area so there is no noise at night - very important if you have to get energy for next day shopping! The beds were amazing - a feather mattress topper is on my shopping list! The room was large, with two double beds, it was modern and bright. The bathroom was also large with great freebies! The only downside to this hotel was breakfast - everything is indiviually priced and pricy! I think they would have more customers if there was a set price and then you help yourself as they do in Hilton  Raddisson in Europe.Staff were all friendly and always available for questions.Would not hesitate to reccommend or stay here again.

Myself and my boyfriend came to Boston from Ireland for St. Patrick's Day and the Hilton was the perfect place to stay.. the room was huge for the both of us, the bed could have fit three people and the pillows were so comfy I would have brought them home if they would have fit in my suitcase!

<Content>Fabulous hotel卢 My husband and I stayed here from 21st-25th March 2008 and cannot fault the hotel at all! The location is perfect - within 3 blocks of quincy market and some fantastic bars/restaurants and lots of shops, yet the hotel is in a really quiet street which feels a million miles away from the tourist centre. It's also close to the freedom trail and boston common and very accessible from the airport (2 stops on the 'T' and a very short walk).Check in staff were very accommodating and welcoming...much needed after 2 hours at immigration! We were upgraded to an extremely spacious and well equipped suite, which had everything you could possibly want from a hotel, other than perhaps a good view - surrounded by tall buildings.The hotel staff were quick to meet any of our needs - more towels and milk for coffee, at any time of day. The bed was huge and very comfortable and the bathroom very clean.We didn't really use any other hotel facilities, although there is a lovely library off of the lobby and the restaurant looked lovely. Concierge was very helpful looking after our bags after check out until we were ready to leave for the airport.When we go back to Boston, this is the only hotel we will consider! We got a very cheap deal with trailfinders - 3 nights for 拢160 for the 2 of us.

<Content>CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION Caution! Caution! Caution! This hotel is lovely and in a very conventient location, however, if you want to sleep at night before 3am, don't bother staying here. We got to our hotel at about 9:45 pm, crawled into bed as we had an early departure out of the city, and all we could hear was the music from the bar across the street and people out on the street. We called the front desk at about midnight to ask for a resolve and they said they wasn't anything they could do as we were the first to complain. We called the front desk again at 1:30am and asked if they had any earplugs and was just told no. If you stay at this hotel, make sure your room is not across from Mr. Dooley's Bar and higher up than the 5th floor.

<Content>ruined our trip I will not detail the problems we had with this hotel but they ruined what could have been a great time, there was a mess up with our booking which the desk was not very helpful with at all, the cleanliness of the room left alot to be desired, and the bar staff have some scam going which i couldnt quite figure out and neither could there boss, i will say the concierge and door staff were very helpful. if staying in this area then the sports bar next to the aquarium t station is well worth a visit, decent drinks and good food with friendly staff.

<Content>Worst Experience If you are a Federal employee, I'd advise you to stay away from this property. I arrived on Monday night for a three night stay while attending training. I provided my official identification and travel orders. The desk clerk told me that this information wouldn't be sufficient since my travel orders were e-mailed to me, I didn't have a tax exempt number (?), and I didn't have printed travel orders on official stationary, sign by my department head describing the purpose and length of my stay. I told him that he was wrong. He said that he'd check with his accounting office and leave me a message the next day. Apparently there was no one after four who could deal with this dilema. When I went back the next day, the clerk told me that the accounting person had called during the day when he wasn't working and asked if I'd like to speak with this person.  The next day the person in charge of my training spoke with the accounting person. A resolution was reached. If I provided a Form 9828, they would not charge sales tax for my stay. That afternoon, upon returning to the hotel, I provided the desk with the completed form with the direction to bring it to the accounting person. Upon checking out, the charges were still there.

<Content>Claustrophobic room; rude staff, great location I am surprised to see all the reviews of this hotel describing their large rooms. Our experience was not pleasant. We came to Boston to celebrate St Patrick's Day with my sister who lives in Boston. My sister and her son came with us as we checked in. A rude young woman at the desk smirked to my husband in mock surprise oh, your family is very large, implying that we were trying to stuff extra people into the room. We should have left the hotel at that point! Our room was very small (even by Manhattan standards!) and very dark- overlooking an interior alleyway. Our ceiling light had a naked bulb -- I asked for a globe to cover it as soon as we entered the room - but when we returned 4 hours later it was still not done. After a second request they finally fixed it. The tub drain did not work properly either. We picked this hotel for the excellent location,but I will never stay there again. Our overall impression was that it was an old, dark, cramped and aging building with creaking elevators and rude staff. There are other hotels in the vicinity that are a better choice.

<Content>Superb staff and great rooms! Stayed here for a convention in early March. Great view of Boston Harbor from my room on the 15th floor. Huge room with super comfy bed. Very quiet! Hotel bar was posh and the drink prices reflected that, but it is downtown Boston. Hotel bar closed at 11:30pm, but the staff was very helpful in helping us find some cheaper, more relaxed places to hang out that were very close by. Even on weeknights some of the local dance/karaoke places were hoppin'. Had room service for breakfast and it arrived quickly and everything was still hot. Only complaint was the limited table space (small round table next to bed full of stuff and a cluttered desk). Not really convenient for eating in your room. Everything was very clean and the shower and bath fixtures looked brand new (Kohler). Elegant lobby and brass finishings everywhere. After checking out (and reaching home 5 hours later), I realized that I left something. The cleaning staff could not find it, but said they would check in the laundry area. Got a call the next day. Great service!

<Content>Boston in the snow What a great hotel, wonderful city everyone so friendly. It snowed on our first day but that did not stop us, staff at the hotel were so so helpful, with directions and maps. Restaurant was very nice with staff on hand to advise on all aspects of food choices. I stayed here with my daughter (who is 18) and even she enjoyed it and we know how teenagers are so hard to please. I would go back tomorrow if I could. Complmentary coffee and warm apple cider were available in the foyer during the course of the day.This hotel was in a great location and all attractions in easy reach, and walking distance.. I did think that being in the financial district it may well of been very business orientated, but believe me what a great hotel.

<Content>We'll be back again We were a group of five girls from Northern Ireland travelling to Boston for a Christmas shopping trip. We had booked a triple and double room. On arrival we were shown to 2 identical rooms each with 2 double beds (queen sized for the UK readers, huge for single sleepers but tiny for 2 adults sharing); we mentioned to the wonderful bell boy we'd booked a triple and a double and we (the 3 sharing) were easily upgraded to a king suite with sofa bed. The rooms were well kept, clean and with adequate space, with lovely crabtree and Evelyn toilettries The staff we fantastic in the hotel; I had problems using a $500 travellers cheque in one shop (not accepted in most of Boston due to a freud problem), yet the conceierge went totally out of his way to find a store who would cash it for me, he was amazing, thanks Charles. The reception was welcoming with wood panneling and seasonal Christmas decor, enhanced by complementary hot chocolate or mulled apple available from mid afternoon onwards. The restaurant provided lovely food, but it was was pricey: there is an excellent Irish pub for evening meals and deli's for breakfast on the door step though. The location was great, the city is so walkable, Quincys Markets is 3 minutes walk away, yet the hotel was quiet- some of us who had previously stayed in NewYork for shopping trips were amazed at how silent the rooms were at night, and how quiet the streets were. We were so happy, we're already booked again for Dec 2008 which says it all!

<Content>Great stay at the Hilton Stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights up to 30 Dec. We were in Boston to attend a family wedding and had a total of 8 rooms between 14 people which were conveniently all located on the same floor. Really liked the hotel, the room and bathroom were spacious, clean and well kept. As others have noted room size is really pot luck, we had a pretty decent double room, however my brother who was staying on his own had a room about twice as large as ours! In any case our room size was perfectly adequate for our needs. Beds were large and comfortable and there was a lovely selection of toiletries in the bathroom. Our room was kept clean and well tided and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Some of my family who were flying back to Ireland on 31 Dec asked for and were given a late checkout free of charge. Location is pretty quiet but there are still a number of restaurants closeby and you can either walk or take a short taxi journey to all sights.There were a couple of irritations during our stay. The water in the rooms cost a hefty $4.50 per bottle. Arriving off a long flight from Germany we didn't have much opportunity to go out and buy cheaper water, so ending up paying $9 for approx. 1 litre of water! In saying that the next evening when we got back to our room, we'd been given a couple of bottles of complimentary water, which was a nice gesture. My fiance was keen to check his emails whilst we were there. The hotel was advertising a rate of $9.99 for 24 hours in-room internet access via the TV (there was a keyboard attached). On signing up for this however it didn't work and when we rang the concierge they informed us that it was unavailable and that we should use the internet in the Business Center at a rate of $10 for 10 mins (which we didn't)! Other than these couple of minor issues our stay was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend the hotel to other travellers to Boston. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nice but some frustrations I wanted to love the Hilton, and in some ways, I did, but in others, we were disappointed. My husband and I just came back from enjoying two days there relaxing over New Year's, and there were positives. Our room was clean and large by city standards, but I agree with earlier posts that size of room is completely luck of the draw based on what I saw on the floor diagram. The bed was very comfortable, and the location of the hotel was great for being out and about in the city for First Night -- close enough to get there fast but far enough away to avoid the worst of the noise. The staff was great -- helpful and courteous, though we were disappointed that our request for an upper-floor room was not duly noted until we pointed it out, and then we were only put on floor 9 (of a 15 floor hotel). Our room maid was wonderful, however. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was fabulous -- a really good buffet though it was part of a package for us. Not cheap if you have to pay separately, but worth it.And that brings me to the negatives. The hotel nickels and dimes you with charges for things that in other hotels might be part of the high rate charged. Wireless internet is on a per-day charge, and if you instead decide that you'll just use the hotel's Business Center, be prepared to pay a minimum of a $10 charge then $1 per minute after 10 minutes. This seemed ludicrous to us who just wanted to check our e-mail. The bottles of water in the room were available for a mere $4.50 each (we bought some of our own nearby for a lot less), and a $80 charge for dinner in the hotel bar when we only had a few drinks and two light entrees seemed really high, even by hotel restaurant standards. In general, it seemed that the four-star rating was not really warranted given how many of the little extras one expects at four-star locales involved extra charges here. In addition, there were some aging issues -- the sheet that had a hole along the edge where it was folded over on our bed; the scratchy towels that were too old to still be soft and fluffy; the slightly worn wood on the furniture like the arm chair and entertainment center. The room was also quite noisy, in part due to the expected city sounds, but also due to how easily we could here our loud neighbors across the hall as they came and went.It was not a bad experience -- in fact, we were quite happy when all was said and done. But with a little more inclusiveness in their rates and some upgrading of slightly aging fixtures, this hotel could more fully embody a four-star experience.

<Content>Fantastic food! Booked through Trailfinders and when we asked what the 'Trailfinders Bonus' quoted on the voucher meant ... we promptly got upgraded to a suite! Fabulous room with the biggest and most comfortable bed we've ever slept in! Also very quiet. The buffet breakfast isn't cheap, but it is delicious and has something for everyone.We also had 2 evening meals in the restaurant - these too were delicious. The restaurant staff were excellent.A good location as only a short step from the harbour and from Feneuil Hall market. Would definitely book again.

<Content>Giant Rooms The Boston Hilton Financial District is an elegant hotel in a great location with helpful staff. The lobby is beautiful with a well-appointed library and free coffee in the morning and cider in the evening. You need a room key to access upper floors from the elevator which adds a feeling of security. The rooms are enormous. The ceiling height is phenomenal. The views (and we were only on the 6th floor of 15) were fantastic. We had booked two rooms for our family of five, but easily could have fit into one room. One of our rooms was a corner room and I think it was as big as three other hotel rooms would have been. We were hoping for connecting rooms, but they don't have those at all. That was our only disappointment with the hotel. The building is very old and solidly built, so once you close your door, you hear nothing from hallways, rooms next door or rooms above.The rooms were well decorated and the beds were very comfortable. We had free breakfast passes and thoroughly enjoyed the buffet. The staff at the restaurant and throughout the hotel were very helpful. They even let us borrow a screwdriver which we needed to put together a Christmas present (not to fix anything in our room, don't worry).The hotel is right across from restaurants and bars and cafes and only a few blocks from Quincy Market, the Freedom Trail and the Aquarium. It was an easy walk to South Station and fairly close to the Children's Museum. We could easily have walked to the Common, the North End or the USS Constition.I would highly recommend staying at the Boston Hilton Financial District.

<Content>Adequate Holiday Hotel This is a good hotel.The rooms are very big and comfortable,although a little dark.We stayed in Winter but I would have thought that the air conditioning would be loud in Summer.The breakfasts were lovely but the dinner was only ok and the restaurant and bar area is slightly cold and uninviting in the evenings.Overall, this hotel is good but not for lounging around in the evenings.It is in a very good location though so there are ample restaurants, bars  shops nearby.

<Content>No complaints The Hilton Financial District is a good hotel for a city break. In fact we had no complaints. We booked two rooms and both were of a high standard. They were spacious, nicely decorated and well maintained. We didn't use the hotel facilities so can't comment on them. Reception staff were pleasant and professional. Charles, the concierge helped us arrange a shopping trip to Wrentham and he was friendly, efficient and just down right nice. The hotel location is good, just a couple of blocks from Quincy market. the subway is about 5 minutes walk away. If we go to Boston again we will probably stay here.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at this hotel because it was close to Fanueil Hall and other historical areas. It is only a short walk to shopping, trolley tours and restaurants. Our favorite restaurant was across from the hotel - Umbria Italian Steakhouse - where you could not find a bad meal. The veal dishes were superb, and the filet was as tender and delicious as any we had ever eaten! If we wanted a sandwich or lunch, we simply turned the other direction and ate at Dooley's - an Irish tavern with a great Irish mixed grill as well as a pleasant atmosphere. The room - actually a junior suite - was quiet and well maintained. Room service was prompt and reasonable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton.

<Content>Very Quiet and Comfortable I went to Boston for a class that was being held in at the Hilton and I loved it. The room was different than most cookie cutter rooms. It had a very high ceiling with crown molding. It was homey. It was a close walk to lots of places to eat and the afternoon I got there I walked around the New England Aquarium, it was only a few blocks over. I was able to walk to the freedom trail and felt safe the entire time. The bellmen were espeically nice. They laughed and in turn made the people around them smile at their antics.

<Content>Relaxed Elegance at Hilton Boston My husband and I stayed in this wonderful hotel for 2 nights. What a wonderful stay we had!. The lobby area is beautiful with a very nice bar and library, unfortunately we did not have long enough to experience fully. We had a beautiful double bedroom on the 12th floor and had the most comfortable sleep of our trip and a sumptous bathroom with lovely toiletries and warm bath robes just what a person needs after a long day sightseeing in this wonderfully quaint city.The room was clean and well maintained and the bathroom was spotless. The hotel is situated in the Financial District with easy access to all the main tourist areas - if you need to get somewhere a little further out there are taxis outside at all times, very reasonably priced and the concierge is very helpful and friendly when it comes to directions.Could not rate this hotel highly enough - it is wonderful to feel like a superstar in a city centre hotel.

<Content>Very nice choice to stay in Boston !!!!!!!!! Me and my girlfriend stayed at Hilton Financial District for two nights. The hotel was very nice located, exactly how we expected it to be, following tripadvisor麓s comments. The room was very nice, confortable, we stayed in a two queen bed room, so it was a little small to stay for two nights, but the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is something we have to write about, because it is really big and very well decorated, it麓s really a beautiful bathroom. The Lobby is also beautiful and it has a good bar. The concinierge service was very helpful and kind, making us a reservation to go in a city tour that was a lot of fun, even though it was raining a lot, so it was the only thing that did not help much. Well, the parking service costs R$38,00 per day !! I though it was expensive but we didn't get to find another cheaper option working on this weekend. Generally talking, we liked the hotel a lot, even though nothing surprised us , it was a good option.We would stay there again , but next time we would stay at a suite room, bigger than we stayed in .

<Content>Nice but not spectacular. A family of 4 stayed on one of the suites for 3 nights over a long October weekend. The hotel was a short ride from the airport. We stayed in a suite that we found to be very nice. It was bigger than a suite at something like the Embassy Suites, a little nicer too. The bathroom was nice but nothing too elaborate. The only concerns I had about the hotel itself was that the walls were thin so that if someone was watching TV with much volume next to you, you may be able to tell what they are watching. Also, if you are on a low floor, you may hear noise from the streets. We were on the 4th floor and could hear the Red Sox celebrations coming from the local watering holes. But not enough to keep me from staying here. We did wish they had a resonable, or even better, free breakfast. But, there are several spots to stop close by for a quick breakfast. Note that since this hotel is in the business district, some places are not open on weekends. It was less than a 10 minute walk to the T. Would be nice if a little closer, but nothing too bad. We would consider staying here again but might prefer the Copley area is you can find a reasonable price for a hotel, especially one with a suite.

<Content>Wont be staying here again We stayed here for 6 nights at the end of September. On booking a few months ago we requested a room on a high floor. In the event we got a room on the 5th floor. Firstly since this is the financial district, some of the rooms are surrounded by high buildings and are gloomy (we turned the first room down since it was dark and very small) but got allocated another on the 5th floor overlooking Broad Street. What all the reviews here dont state is that every morning between 3-4 a.m. the rubbish for the street is collected, and very noisy it is too. After this come all the deliveries for the street and so its almost impossible to get any sleep after 3-4 a.m.The facilities could do with some updating as well. There was no room safe and one of those silly hairdryers attached to the wall in the bathroom (and yes I am being picky but when you suffer from sleep deprivation, thats what happens!)The staff mostly were very pleasant. The bar staff were not terribly attentive.On the plus side, the hotel is extremely well placed for dining and travelling around, being near Long Wharf and Quincy Market.

<Content>Really handy to shops I love to shop. I've stayed at this hotel twice and hope to book again for this years shopping trip.On my first trip (Nov '05) I had a HUGE room.Last year (Nov '06) had a really SMALL room.Rooms on both occassions were clean and warm.....what else do you need when you're out shopping from early in the morning till late at night ?First year I arrived into the city by water ferry from the airport-It was an unconventional and pretty way to arrive and I'd recommend it but ONLY if you have very little luggage to trail behind you.Last year I arrived using the 'T'....again I'd only recommend this if you travel light, but it's within easy walking distance of the hotel.Hotel REALLY close to Quincey Market etc and the 'bargain hunters' shops and department stores.If you want the more 'upmarket' and (in my opinion) 'pricey' shops this isn't so handy.I HIGHLY recommend taking a DUCK tour-very informative and entertaining-will take it again this year.If you're a bargain hunter you should visit Wrentham Village Premium Outlets -I've arranged this through the hotel conceirge- it's expensive, but you're picked up and dropped of at the hotel door which is really handy.Theres an Irish pub and a sports bar a few doors away.Haven't eaten in hotel but there are coffee and muffin places close by.

<Content>Good hotel, great location Have just returned from my second stay at the Hilton Financial District (formerly Wyndham). Check-in was very quick and easy and a slight problem with room allocation was quickly resolved.The location of the hotel is great and within walking distance of the main attractions as well as being close to a T stop (subway) if you wsih to travel furher afield.You seem to get the luck of the draw here when it comes to room sizes as some rooms are quite small (but perfectly adequate) whereas others are huge in comparison. As others have noted, the beds are comfy as are the ergonomic desk chairs and all other facilities are good with equality bedding, towels and associated products, A few nice touches include the easy to operate and nice coffee machines. Housekeeping is good and of a high standard and turn down service (although somewhat sporadic) offered complimentary water and chocolates. The only slight drawback to the rooms is that they are a little bit dark but the bathrooms are generally large, airy, bright and well appointed. We ate breakfast at the hotel and although the breakfast is similar to other hotels of this standard the waiting staff are all excellent and very helpful.The best part of the hotel for us was the helpful front desk staff and notable the Concierge John who was a great help in reserving a car as well as Chris the bellman who stopped us from getting lost and was full of lots of useful advice and tip, thanks!

<Content>Best Sleep Ever The most memorable thing about this stay was the bed since I managed to have the best rest I've had in months. The bed is absolutely comfy.I reserved the room on Hilton's website and noted that I wanted did not want feather bedding. My experience has been that most hotels ignore this request until I arrive and I have to call housekeeping to replace the bedding.During the check-in, the front desk actually told me that they noted my request for no feather bedding and accommodated my request. What a very pleasant surprise.The room was huge, even with two double beds in it -- I thought it could have fit a few more pieces of furniture. That was how big the room was. It's a nice change from claustrophobic hotels that give you tiny rooms that you can barely move in.Amenities (bathroom, mini bar) were very nice, and of course, who could miss the Herman Miller chair (that was comfy, too). Obviously, the hotel is advertising these products: their special beds by Serta, the chair, the Moen shower head, etc. Yes, I ooh-d and ahh-d over these items and liked it.The Hilton was in the business district of Boston, so it was dead quiet on the weekend, and many diners/restaurant were closed during the day because they cater to the business crowd. There are several bars in the area where the kids hang out, but it the hotel was sufficiently far enough that there were no noticeable street noise.However, there are two shopping areas within walking distance of the hotel, so when I had to buy a few things I forgot to pack, it was no trouble to find a department store and a drug store near by.It's also close to the Freedom Trail, if one is ambitious and packed sneakers to do it.The hotel was efficient in it's check in and check out procedures. Housekeeping was impeccable.The only down side to our stay is their restaurant: does not open on time nor does it have great service. We waited for 20-30 minutes after the 7 a.m. posted time for the restaurant to open for breakfast. Since none of the area restaurants/diners were open on the weekend, we were stuck waiting for this one. We would have left and found another place to go if it was the weekday. As for the service: the wait staff spent more time running around like chickens without heads than actually doing their jobs. The breakfast buffet was anemic: there were too many missing items, like no dairy, but they put the cereal out. Pancakes and no maple syrup. That sort of thing. Good luck trying to get the staff's attention to actually ORDER breakfast from their menu.We did not order room service since we have had bad experience with it in the past in other hotels. As we were going down to breakfast, I did notice quite a few room service lids/service table next to service elevator. Room service start at 6:30 a.m. on weekends and the restaurant was supposed to be open at 7 a.m. In hindsight, we probably should have ordered room service.If have a car, the valet parking here is expensive: $35/day. There is a parking garage nearby -- that's the same garage your car is going to be in since the Hilton does not have a garage on the premises. The valet runs there to get your car.In the end, I enjoyed my stay despite the restaurant's shortcomings. We only had breakfast there. There are tons of better restaurants in Boston for lunch, dinner and drinks.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay at a better hotel.

<Content>Luxurious hotel i booked this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel of quality that I could find in boston that was also within a close proximity of all the attractions in boston. at the time I booked it i was shocked by how much i had to spend for a hotel - but it was 1/2 the price of anywhere else. When we walked into the room we were Pleasantly surprised and very happy with this hotel. Bed was huge - and very comfortable. the room was very comfortable and clean. the bathroom was huge and amazing. there was a luxurious bathrobe as well as many large luxurious towels. Bed linens were so soft and of top quality. my only complaint is that they charge for wireless internet access. for the price they charge for a room they should have complimentary internet access.

<Content>Its an ok hotel...but not great. I recently stayed at the Hilton Boston Financial District and was neither impressed nor disappointed. My room was quite small and faced the opposite wing of the hotel which, if you didn't keep your blinds drawn, would allow people to see inside your room. (Think Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window). The hallways were FREEZING but interestingly my room never got that cold as I usually like to sleep with the air set low. Beds were comfortable and slept well however the water pressure in the shower was a bit unpredictable as well as the temperature which seemed to fluctuate between really hot and really cold. There was also a really noisy vent in the room that seemed to kick on randomly; not sure if it was connected to the a/c or not. My only real complaint with the hotel was the cost of the items in the lobby bar. Don't hotels serve plain old hamburgers anymore? Instead its a goat cheese and roma tomato pizza for 15 dollars. Luckily there are a couple of great pubs in the area, one practically next door however when its raining you wish that you didn't have to leave the hotel.The location was ok. Bit of a walk to the T and Boston Common. I arrived on a Sunday and the neighborhood, being the financial district, was really quiet with no one around. In fact almost every night was really quiet which made coming home in the evenings a bit concerning as there were very few people around.Would stay there again if I had to but I would imagine there are much better hotels in the area for the amount of money I paid.

<Content>Great Hotel My Mother and I have just returned from a wonderful trip to Boston. The Hilton is a great Hotel with a nice location to major attractions. We had a small problem with a leaky faucet in the bathroom and in return for the inconvience we got a free room upgrade and vouchers for a free buffet breakfast offered at the hotel for the remainder of our trip. The staff could not have been more helpful and accomadating. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. I love to visit Boston not only for the History,great food, and culture but also because the people who live in Boston are so pleasant. We had a bit of difficulty riding the T and it was through the kindness of strangers that made the trip more enjoyable.

<Content>Service bad at times After finding out that my room wasn't ready, I checked in my bag with the bellhop. The bellhop asked me if I was a guest there and then laughed. I didn't find this to be funny at all - very rude actually. This is a small issue, but still reflects on the attention to detail: the next morning, I noticed every room had a USA today newspaper at its doorway except mine. Lastly, when I had forgotten to check out via the phone system, I had called a few hours later and notified the front desk that I needed to check out. The person at the front desk said in an unpleasant tone that the room was checked out and that meant that somebody in my room must of checked me out. Clearly, I was the only guest and I replied that if I didn't check out, then obviously, I was under the impression that I still needed to. This was an incident that this employee made unnecessarily unpleasant. These may be small incidents, but next time I'm going to stay at another hotel with better service.

<Content>Excellent Overall Experience Stayed here for 2 nights with wife and daughter (10) at the start of our vacation. I have stayed in Boston many times and found this property to be in a great spot for siteseeing. My rate (Hilton internet prepaid) was (got two nights for slighty greater than one night's rate at Longwharf Marriott for example) good compared to nearby properties. The room was of very good size, was quiet, and had very comfortable bedding. They were efficient enough to have the roll away bed already in the room when we checked out (this seems to happen infrequently elsewhere). The bathroom was nice and had a great shower. We had a tiny view of Boston Harbor but mainly of nearby buildings. In addition to the nice room the major asset of this hotel is its location. Several short blocks to Faniuel Hall/ Quincy Market, the New England Aquarium, Colombus Park, waterfront, etc. It's also a very easy walk into the North End (the Italian section with an exceptional number of great restarants, etc). You can also walk a block or two in the AM to a great bagel place (Finagel a Bagel), among many other casual places to eat and drink. Subway access is extremely close by. No pool (sorry, kids). Also, no safe in the rooms but there is a front desk safe deposit box with 24/7 access. Staff was not unfriendly but bellmen seemed to be always talking to their friends rather than greeting guests, opening door (as other places seem to do). No big deal. Concierge was nice as was gentleman at check out time. Would definitely consider staying here again and would recommend it to a friend.

<Content>Great location for aquarium  My daughter and I had the Hilton FAMILY PACKAGE which was a real deal! We got tickets to the aquarium, breakfast buffet, an in-room movie, snack bags of popcorn and little soda bottles. It also comes with a Discovery Kids backpack filled with a digicam and other little things. We had a great time!The walk to the aquarium and whale watching is super easy and then also a quick hop to Quincy Market. This hotel is excellently located for that part of town. (A cab to Copley Plaza was $8)Our corner room (1216) was a suite with living room, dining table with 4 chairs plus a king bedroom. We had some very nice harbor and surrounding views. The bed was plush and comfortable with lots of pillows. The bathroom was marble and excellent. I am now a big fan of the Crabtree and Evelyn La Source products that the hotel provided.We had room service for dinner and the table was perfect for that purpose. The margarita pizza was very tasty and the kid's pasta was hearty. The room has a wet bar which we didn't use.The breakfast buffet at Caliterra was perfect....lots of choices both healthy and decadent.I followed a GREAT tip from another tripadvisor post and parked around the corner at ONE and TWO INTERNATIONAL PLACE for $7 on the weekends. I was in at noon and out at 3pm the next day for $7.00. This was a huge savings and literally is a few minutes walk to the hotel.My only complaint is that the ventilation does let smoke smells come through. It was awful at times.

<Content>great hotel at a great location We booked this through Priceline for a rate of 110 USD/night + tax for 3 nights. The location is great - very close to major attractions, restaurants, sights etc. Our room was of a decent size, clean, well kept and furnished. The concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable, gave excellent restaurant recommendations. I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking for a good value at a central location.

<Content>Not great. We initially picked this Hilton because of the location (within walking distance to a lot of the great sites of Boston as well as the T). Unfortunately, it's location ended up being the most redeeming quality.We booked a three-night stay with one night being covered by Hilton Honors Points. Our room was on the top floor (15th) with a nice view of the water. I found the room itself to be average--I would have expected more from a Hilton (and our $199 per night price). The carpet was a bit worn as was the chair. The bathroom was tiny and the vanity mirror on the wall was broken. It did look like they were doing some work in the hallways (until almost 10pm one night!) and the lobby so perhaps it will get better.After our first night we spent the day exploring wonderful Boston. Upon returning to our room at close to 4pm we found housekeeping had not been in it. We called the front desk to inquire and they said they'd check and call us. They never called but soon someone from housekeeping showed up and told us we were supposed to have checked out of our room at 3pm that day! We once again called the front desk (they seemed clueless) and were told they'd have another set of keys brought to us which didn't make sense at all. We decided to go down to the front desk and take care of it. We found two staff that both were trying to work on our problem at the same time but the other didn't know it. They ended up getting into a discussion about it right in front of us. We overheard them say another staff member had booked someone else in our room for two nights. After a wait, we were given new keys to the same room. They said they were sorry but that was it. We found one concierge to be quite helpful (Dragona?) and the other not helpful at all.Also note--the walls are thin and there is no soundproofing to the outside. There are many bars around the hotel and it gets really really loud after 2a.m.I don't think we'll stay here again. Our Hampton Inn in Manhattan during the same trip was much nicer, more updated and quieter than the Hilton in Boston.

<Content>Recommended Not a lot to say other than that we found this hotel to be of an excellent standard. We did not experience any problems whatsoever with the accomodation, staff, location nor anything else. A special mention is deserved for the bed which had the most comfortable and sumptuous mattress I have ever slept on! All in all a hotel that we would not hesitate to recommend and that we would be pleased to stay at again.

<Content>Not bad... Not AMAZING, but not bad. It did just fine... I have stayed in A LOT of hotels in my life and I just loved how the Hilton has marble bathrooms. It made everything else lacking seem much more luxurious than it probably was.The hotel staff is VERY VERY VERY slow, and though they are nice people, they are not the most accommodating. Upon check in I was given a smoking handicapped access room. Even though that room (for all you needing handicap access rooms) is absolutely GORGEOUS, I really didnt prefer it. So I went back downstairs, told them to give me a king non-smoking, and they agreed. Room was changed in about an hour. Again, very slow staff.The room itself was on the top floor (the 15th), and on the small side, but still nice. The decor was nice, the carpet seemed clean, the room updated enough. The bathroom was ginormous, and the toiletries were complete.Parking is $39/day and only offered as valet. The location is good though a little confusing to find if you are driving. A hint: From the waterfront, find State Street. Once you see Club Vertigo, turn left. That is Broad.Location is literally a four minute walk to Faneiul Hall, and thirty second walk to the first bar. Walkable to the North End, the waterfront, and a bit of a hike to Back Bay.Great location. The hotel itself was fine. Not breathtaking, but suitable for a four star. Didnt leave me in awe, but I approved I guess....

<Content>Recommended! We stayed at the Hilton Financial District as a way to spend a few days exploring Boston after a conference.It is wonderfully located, and a sound choice. Not quite to the standards I have come to expect from a Hilton property, but still very comfortable, spacious, and with a fine restaurant. (More like a Doubletree to be honest).I would go back.

<Content>Super place, great location to downtown Just back from the Hilton Financial Boston, cannot say enough great things about the place. Gave us a room on 12th floor even could see the water if we leaned a little. Huge refurbished room, thick terry bathrobes, nice marble/chrome bathroom. Only minor complaint was everything was feathers, pillows  comforter, and I'm super allergic. They did everything to try and find hypoallergenic ones but too late for the first night (our fault for checking in late). The staff is above and beyond in the service and friendly department. Clean rooms, clean hotel. They serve great coffee in the morning in the lobby area, take a cup back to the room, although there are little 2 cup makers in the room, but that's work! Book thru priceline if you can, it's SO worth it! I could give it a 5 star, but save those for the REALLY REALLY special places, this is in the heart of the city and it's a nice hotel, but not REALLY REALLY special if you see what I mean... The location btw is unbeatable, we were about 10 minutes walk from the Omni Parker House, where there was a wedding attended. The church was another 5 minutes, and it's really a safe area all around... no need to worry even for two single (great looking I might add....LOL) women!!!!!!!! Boston has a fabulous vibe...

<Content>great location, nice hotel This hotel is in a great location. Rooms are spacious. You can walk to Faneuil Hall and other attractions. Valet is quick. The only issue I had was the shower-it is a nice sort of waterfall showerhead, but the pressure is not strong to wash your hair. Otherwise excellent hotel and highly recommended.

<Content>Great value We stayed here at the end of April 2007 for 4 nights, having booked through a UK discounted website. We had fabulous service (to the extent any of the staff who had helped us, they would come say hello if they saw us again - the barman even providing some complementary cheesecake when he heard we never ate desserts as we were always too full!). Our room was large (although just a little lacking in light), the bathroom lovely, breakfasts good (get the pancakes without icing sugar if you don't have a sweet tooth) and the location spot on. Well recommended. We felt it had a really personal touch for such a large business hotel in a big city - we would recommend this for all.

<Content>Nice hotel My wife  I stayed in Hilton Broad St for 4 night's last weekend  enjoyed our stay. We arrived at Boston Logan at 3:30pm and got a taxi to hotel, cost was $25 incl tip  we were checked in by 4:45pm.Check inn was prompt, staff were friendly and we were happy with the room as it was a good size,  incl all mod cons you would expect for a 4**** hotel.We did not have breakfast but did have food in the bar a few times and it was good. The location of the hotel means that restaurants, shopping etc is within walking distance away and there is a taxi rank outside.Overall we had a good time in Boston and would stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Awesome I can't possibly say enough great things about our stay at this hotel. Location was awesome - we had access to any part of Boston we wanted to see - most within walking and the rest with the T right nearby. Room was awesome - very spacious, comfortable bed and pillows, and very quite - never heard any neighbors. Service was awesome - smiles everywhere, offers of help were unending, and food recommendations were right on. If I ever visit Boston again, we wouldn't stay anywhere else!

<Content>Great Location and Hotel Stayed on a Saturday night. The location is perfect - you can pretty much walk to most areas (Quincey Market/Chinatown/Downtown Crossing/Prudential Center/North End). Room was nice - bed was very comfortable. Would consider a return stay.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay! We have stayed at the Hilton Back Bay several times and liked it, but decided to try this hotel instead, and we had a great stay. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member we were upgraded to a beautiful suite, that was very large and comfortable. The service was first class from check-in through our entire stay. The Concierge was excellent and gave great directions and suggestions. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant at all. The location is excellent and there are many great restaurants around. The staff was very, very friendly and helpful, from the front desk to the valet. We had a really great weekend and will stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Location Went to visit my college daughter with my son. I booked a suite; it was only a few bucks more than a room and WOW. It was huge and very comfortable for the 3 of us.Service was great; food very good. We loved the location and would have walked around more but it was freezing!Will definitely return.

<Content>Pretty hotel, nice location, bad for sleeping I booked this hotel at a reasonable rate on a popular discount travel website, cost for a Thursday and Friday night stay were $100 each night before taxes. The hotel was easy to find and is quite nice on the inside. We were given a corner room on the 4th floor which was spacious with a large bathroom. Trying to fall asleep the first night was not easy. A door near our room kept being opened and closed and it was easy to hear the conversation of the person in the next room who stayed on the phone until close to midnight and then was up talking again at 6:30am. We mentioned this to management and they said that security would check to be sure it was a bit quieter the next night. Same problem again just with new neighbors. I was very surprised at how thin the walls were at this 4 star hotel. Also we tried to use the internet, which cost over $10 just to gain access to, so we walked down the street and were able to find free wi-fi at a nearby cafe. I would not stay at this hotel again mainly because we were hardly able to get any sleep and the lack of reasonably priced services made it very inconvenient to get much done.

<Content>Small room, thin walls I stayed here on a Thursday night on business. The room was on the small side, although the bathroom was surprisingly large. Furnishings were nice and up to Hilton's standards. The biggest downside to this hotel was that the walls were paper thin. I could hear every conversation in the room next door and was awoken every time a door closed in the hallway. Based on the amount of sleep that I lost, I will not stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic! We stayed here for three nights in February after snapping up a fantastic rate of 拢85 a night for a king deluxe room.On our arrival we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom corner suite on the 11th floor.The room was very clean having recently been renovated and was very well furnished with lovely bedding (the most comfortable bed), good sized bathroom and plenty of free toiletries to use.Location was great with Fanueil Hall very close by for shopping, and was an easy walk into downtown.Transport to other areas of Boston was very easy with the train station very close, the airport only a 15 minute taxi trip away and an easy to use underground.Loved Boston and the hotel and would definately stay here again!

<Content>Excellent Experience My wife and I stayed in this hotel on a romantic getaway to Boston and we were very pleased by the experience. The hotel was reasonably priced ($130 before tax) and we were upgraded complimentary to a suite upon arrival. The suite was a corner unit with a large living room, large bedroom, and a very nice bathroom. The room was very well kept and up to Hilton standards. Also, the staff was very pleasant and helpful. The conciege helped us get a reservation at a booked up restaurant and we were provided with free room service upon arrival.The only complaint was the elevators. There were only 2 elevators that were not out of order. As such, it was a hassle when we needed to enter or leave the building. All in all, we were very pleased with the experience and look forward to returning.

<Content>Great Getaway night out in Boston We found the romantic rendeveau package through the hotels website. The package included a nights lodging, horsebuggy ride,winechoc strawberries continental breakfast. Had a great time at this well kept and very clean hotel.Pro's were check in was 3pm we arrived at 2pm, and not only were we able to check in right away, we were upgraded to a suite-very nice. Valet service very helpful ($38 night) may seem pricey, but not really compared to other parking and hotels in Boston. The room was well cleaned and mini-bar well stocked, also the bed is very soft and comfortable. The concierge desk was very helpful (john) always pleasant helped with taxis, dinner menus to local restaurants, and made reservations for us as well. Cons: there were only two, first after our 2pm check in we were told room service would send up our winestrawberries right away, at 2:30 I called the front desk and was told they would check on room service for us, at 3:05 we had to leave to catch a show (blue man group- well worth it) and called down again they said we could have the wine  strawberries left in the room or call when we got back-we chose to have them left and they were awaiting us when we returned at 6pm.Second con is very poor buffet breakfast, cold food, bad coffee, and french toast was hard as a rock- definately not a good breakfast.

<Content>Would come back in a heart beat! We had a lovely time at this charming old hotel, the oldest building in the area we were told. The location is about perfect. The New England Aquarium is just a short walk away as is the IMAX theatre next door. We spent one day at the Aquarium and another at Quincy Market and Fanuel Hall during the most bitterly cold days, but loved every minute.The food at the hotel is very expensive for what it is, and instead of spending $56 for scrambled eggs, we highly recommend this warm and wonderful little cafe diagonally across the street from the hotel called The Bean Leaf Cafe. Great coffee and food for not much. We will come back every year to this hotel and am so grateful for our experiences in Boston. The hotel and Boston are a good match.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Great Location Stayed for one quick night on business. Short taxi ride from the airport (~20 min.). The location is great - right near a lot of restaurants and attractions like the aquarium, Quincy Market, etc. You can definitely walk to a lot of sightseeing and dining. My room was very large, 927. It was on the end, and it felt like it was an apartment. The room was booked through my company, but I payed the same rate as everyone else that I was traveling with. Try asking for an end room - it is worth it!I did not try the restaurant because of a private party.

<Content>Beautiful room excellent location! We arrived at the Hilton at 9:00 am and were not only allowed early check in- we were upgraded to a suite! The room was huge and gorgeous. High ceilings with crown molding. Very clean and well kept. The location was fantastic. Easy walk to Boston Commons, harbor front, Fanuiel Hall and TD Banknorth arena. We took the train (Blue T line) from the airport to the Aquarium and the hotel was a 5 minute walk. John the concierge made reservations for us at a north end restaurant- Cantina Italiana. Their homemade pasta was awesome. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again!

<Content>great stay We stayed during the Thanksgiving Holiday. The rooms were large, comfy and had everything you can think of. They even checked us in early and let us check out late. The staff were friendly, and very helpful with directions, etc... This hotel is located in a great spot if you want the Aquarium, Childrens museum, and Fenuell Hall. We never need a car. A great place to eat is the Barking Crab- laid back with great seafood.

<Content>Lovely locations, rooms leave a little to be desired This hotel was still the Wyndham when we booked, but by the time of arrival we were pleasantly surprised to find that Hilton were running itThe location is excellent, with friendly and helpful staff, and everything close at handOur room was small, though with an excellnt bathroom, and looked out onto a lightwell and other structures -- the view is par for the course in an old part of town i gues, but the room size was not up to parOther rooms were larger, so it pays to nicely ask if something else is available!Overall, a nice choice if you need to be in that part of town

<Content>Great two nights at the Hilton Had two nights here with my wife. Excellent hotel! What can I say...The location is excellent. Really great for tourist stuff, convenient transportation via the T. Take the T here to the airport; the Blue line goes all the way from the airport (via free shuttle) to the State House. Don't waste your money on a cab!Had dinner one night at the hotel restaurant. Staff was very kind, food was great. A little pricey, but hey it's gourmet, what do you expect?The view wasn't too nice for our room, but I don't see how one can be at this location. The room was nice, though.No airport shuttle, even though the hotel guide advertised one. Wireless Internet was sorta high (maybe $10?)There are great, cheap places to eat around here. Great sandwich place right around the corner (out the front exit, take a left towards milk st...can't remember the name), $5 brown bag lunch, HUGE sandwich. The Lobby bar at the hotel is kinda busy, I liked the Irish joint Mr. Dooley's right on the corner; good, cheap food and drinks. Great atmosphere. Stay away from Coogan's Bluff, the owner is a crook and the place needs the health inspector to drop in!If I'm ever in Boston again, I'll try to stay here.

<Content>Heed and beware! The general manager of the Bullfinch could not have been more accomodating online as I made my arrangements. My daughter and I wound up with a price that could not be beat for Boston in November, BUT... The rooms ARE small. I had to stand on my bed to open and close the drapes. I don't know how the housekeepers change the linens, which, by the way were very nice. The room appeared to be freshly painted, we had no problem with the carpet BUT the furniture looked like it came from a hotel surplus warehouse. On the third night, we rounded the little desk downstairs to find a note on the ONE elevator that it was out of service. It hadn't occurred to me when I booked the property to ask how many elevators the hotel had. We hiked up nine, well-lit flights of stairs, grateful that my 8-months-pregnant daughter was not with us! The next morning, the door to the stairwell started slamming open and closed very early giving us the clue the elevator had not been repaired. Two very courteous bellmen helped us down to the lobby that morning. The same gentleman who was manning the desk the night before was still there, and holding up well, actually. He'd already removed the third night's taxes and fees, about $40, from the bill, a fair adjustment. Would I stay at the Bullfinch in Boston again? No. It's on the fringe of a neighborhood that is being renovated, but it's not terribly desirable yet. I've never, in Europe or NYC or anywhere, stayed in a room that was as small as ours was. To their credit, the staff could not have been nicer, more polite, or professional. A person who is fit and not terribly picky would probably find it a bargain.

<Content>Nice Hotel in Great Location This hotel is in an excellent location - easy access to the airport and walking distance to Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market (5 mins), North End (10-15 mins) and Boston Common (15-20 mins) and which of course means the T is easily reachable.If you are a diamond club member, I'm sure your room will be sizeable, as it should be as a frequent Hilton guest. However, as a blue level member, paying a special rate through American Express, your room will not be as spacious. The first room I was shown (411) had the look and feel of Marriott Courtyard and was next to construction across the street. The second room (1103) with less noise was even smaller (if possible - and reminiscent of Europe), but fortunately comfortable. Both rooms according to the floor map on the back of the door were the smallest available on both floors. The rooms were nicely furnished and the beds comfortable. And, the bolsters from the beds work well to block the light coming from under the door to the hallway...Room 1103 had a couple of plumbing problems: the sink's cold water spigot leaked when off (a towel kept that from being too irritating), and the shower drain did not stay in the open position unless you either used a foot to push it down while showering (very precarious), or used the weight of a wet washcloth to hold it down (worked best!). Since the room wasn't flooding, and I could handle staying one more night with the inconvenience, I reported it to the front desk. They offered to change my room, but were otherwise not too concerned. I have a feeling that it won't be attended to until a guest becomes irate.The staff were pleasant, the rooms nicely decorated, and the location was excellent and I'd consider this a solid 3 and a half stars.

<Content>Great location, superb service, excellent rooms! This former Wyndham hotel is Hilton's gain. In an absolutely superb location close to Quincy Market, Thaniel Hall, a T station, the Aquarium, along with many pubs and dining options of just about any variety all within walking distance.The rooms are superb. Hilton Diamond members this is your place. The suites, although not equipped with pricey furniture, are very large. Almost too large considering the very reasonable rate. The bed was quite comfortable. Not too soft, not too hard but giving.The staff are very polite, professional and helpful. But the key here is the very nice location and the superb rooms!This Hilton is a deal! Way to go Hilton.The only downside is what I experience at many Hiltons sadly including this one. Its Hilton's repeating canned commercials over their cable TV service. They repeat and repeat and repeat the same ads over and over again. Many of them are politically driven but made to appear as PSAs (public service announcements). HIV ads with Michael Douglas' narration, breast cancer and colon cancer ads running repeatedly become old quickly. If you are like me I like to leave the TV on while I do other things in my room. But hearing HIV infection statistics every 20 minutes is a bit depressing. Come on Hilton, just run the regular commercials everyone else watches please.

<Content>Good Location and Price For anyone who goes to Boston, you will soon realize hotels are expensive. Having lived in Boston for 4 years, I chose the Hilton Financial based on location and price. I paid up front and got a great deal. Saved $60 on the company website compared to the lowest offe I found any any travel website (Orbitz, Yahoo Travel).Hotel is downtown in the financial district which is very quiet on weekend. It was only a 10-15 minute walk to Government Center or State Street subway stations so may not be the best for you in the dead of Boston's winter.There really is no lobby to speak of but the hotel is well kept and typical of a Hilton. Room was massivew. As a matter of factm, it had all the basic furniture (bed, desk, night stands, chairs) and the room still felt empty. Room was in great condition.Negatives were the view as its an old Boston hotel so most of the rooms are looking right at another building 25 feet away. Parking is valet only and costs $38 per night...a little much even for Boston.This was a good stay and Id go there again. Coming here as a tourist, its a 15 minute walk to Fanheuil Hall, Quincy Market and most subway lines. For business purposes, you're right where everything else is most likely. Recommended.

<Content>Good Location, Good Service, Room needed Maint. Work Stayed via HH online reservations @ gov/mil rate of $165 for w/e of 10/21-10/23 (peak w/e in Boston). Conceriege was wonderful, kept bags for us b/4  after check in/out times d/t flight times. Room needed maintenence, 2 lights did not work, TV would go blank  needed to be turned off/on to work. Too late @ night to call to report problems, but reported on check out. Desk rep seemed unconcerned. Big problem, internet access for checking in for flight was $10/10 mins...very poor for a room with this rate. This is a great location to Quincy Market/Fan. Hall  the North End; about 5-10 min walk. Close to subway (take blue line from airport)  to Trolley Tours..would recommend location, be aware, no open deli's/restaurants next to hotels but Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts  above close enough for meals. Recommend the following @ Quincy Market: Chowda for lobster, chowder  bisque, Florentine's in North End for Italian. Enjoy your trip!

<Content>Good hotel; good location We booked the Hilton for a 2 night stay October 20/21...it is a 5 minute walk to Fanuil Hall, which has Godiva chocolate, American Eagle, Anne Taylor and Quincy Market. Quincy Market has every type of food you can think of from thai to italian to indian etc...The hotel itself is beautiful with a very nice lobby...comfy areas to relax after a day of touring Boston...it also has a great bar which is open until 12am...last call at 1130pm...it also has a restaurant which we didnt dine at...but right around the corner is Umbria...one of the best meals my fiance and I have ever had...and we travel alot...try the Quail or Lobster Ravioli...The rooms are nicely sized...not too small...not too big...has a giant bathroom with Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries...good sized wetbar in the room...although they are always overpriced...its nice to have them if you are craving something late at night...there are bars clos by for a late night drink or across the street is a lounge...try the martinis...would stay here again!

<Content>Great Deal at the Hilton My family of three spent a night at this hotel after finding a great deal on Hotwire. Our room was extremely spacious and in addition to two comfortable queen size beds, we had a lovely sitting area with two chairs and footstools, a table and a television set. The bathroom was well decorated, stocked with Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, and featured an excellent shower and plenty of thick towels. Everything was very clean.Due to scheduling problems I needed to request a late checkout. That was no problem and we were able to leave an hour later than the official check-out time. It probably helped that I had a Hilton Honors number.The concierge was very helpful on directions to dining and the doorman gave me terrific driving directions to Kenmare Square (although executing his directions was not for the squeamish!)It is possible to walk from this hotel to the Quincy Market/Fanueil Hall area and even over to the wharf or North End for excellent dining options. We also walked from the hotel to the south end of the Boston Common to visit Emerson College and on a beautiful day, it was a great walk which took about half an hour.Valet Parking was available for $38. If you are driving, I would recommend that you call the hotel and get detailed directions from them. We had a hard time following our mapquest directions with the dig construction and just generally confusing streets in this very old part of the city. I would definitely stay at at this excellent hotel again.

<Content>A hidden gem in Downtown Boston! I wanted to stay in a nice hotel in downtown Boston for our anniversary. I tried Hotwire for my first time and paid $128 for one night! Apparently, it's common to get a Hotwire or Priceline deal for weekends - I noticed on other reviews after I booked this room. Being a holiday weekend, we were able to park on the street overnight for free. Tip-Book a Saturday night, feed the meter until 6pm or 8pm and save the price of a parking garage. The Hilton was just changed from a Wyndham this past June. It's a great location, very nice hotel, no problems. Would definately stay there again! A 4 star hotel in the business district of Boston for $128! It is hard to find but the staff is very helpful with directions whether you're walking or driving, Boston being confusing to a newcomer.

<Content>Not worth it for the price If you are planning on staying here- don't! I booked this hotel as a romantic getaway for my boyfriend and I thinking that I was getting this great deal. When we got there, the room was a handicap smoking room with two small beds. I know Hotwire doesnt allow you to request rooms- but the hotel could not switch us- and since are both non smokers it was less then romantic. Being New Yorkers we headed right for the coffee machine to find they only had stocked our room with decaf (this loses them big points in my book). Tried to order room service first night and it was unavailable. Second day there was no hot water in our room. Room service was ridiculously overpriced. On the flip side- the location was great- and thank you to the person that posted the note about parking down the street- it cost us only 21 bucks for the whole weekend as opposed to the 40 a night that rip off of a hotel charges.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Good Location My friend and I stayed here for a weekend during fall foliage. We paid $120 a night on Priceline, about half the retail price. Value was good. We were given a corner, handicapped room so lots of space. Everything was clean, everything worked right and the staff was pleasant. Location was almost perfect. We took the T from the airport. From the train station, right near Quincy Market, it's about five or six blocks. While it's the financial district and the area is quiet in some ways (i.e. delis and some shops mostly closed on the weekends), there were quite a few clubs, restaurants and bars right near by. It's about a mile to Boston Common and the sites there. We walked it with no problem. You can pick up the Freedom Trail near by. Ten minute walk to the North End and again Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall was a five minute. There are many restaurants, shops and sites near there. Overall, no complaints.

<Content>Pretty good hotel --- everything worked I was in Boston for a weekend meeting and decided to roll the dice with Priceline. For $105 per night, the Hilton was very nice indeed. The wireless internet worked, though I had some problems. I found that it works best if you connect to the network from the lobby and make sure your connection is working before taking your laptop up into your room. Things worked the way I wanted to that way.The housekeeping service was very good --- they accomodated my special requests. The front desk and checkin/checkout went smoothly --- the room was ready when I arrived late at night. The front desk conceirge was friendly, but he gave me the wrong number for Dominos (the one he gave did not deliver to this particular hotel) when I wanted to order a pizza. The location is about a 5 minute walk from the T-stop for either State or Aquarium. So it is conveniently located as well.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Boston Hilton Stayed 3 nights in Boston as part of a trip to celebrate our Silver Wedding anniversary. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived. The girl at check- in was very pleasant  asked if we were there on holiday. When we said it was for our anniversary she looked to see if a suite was available  upgraded us to one for no extra charge. The room was vast with facilities to make tea/coffee, lovely soaps etc in the bathroom  wonderful fluffy bathrobes - heaven! The hotel was bright, clean  airy  the air-conditioning was up to date. The area is quiet but only a 5 minute walk to Faneuil Hall, Quincy market  the harbour. We did the tram tour  the Freedom trail during our visit. We ate breakfast just across the street in a small cafe where we could get omlette with bacon, home fries  toast for less than $6. The food was freshly cooked  if you didn't mind using plastic plates, knives  forks it was great value. We found the people of Boston very friendly  helpful  throughly enjoyed our trip.

<Content>Nice hotel We booked the Hilton Financial thru Priceline for a one night stay. Our room with 2 double beds was spacious  clean  very comfy! Staff was helpful  courteous  we were able to check in early. The main reason for our trip to Boston was for a Sox game at Fenway  we had a fairly easy walk to the T at Govt Center to get to the Kenmore station. I've stayed at other Boston city hotels with a closer proximity to the T, but the streets  alleys were well lit  felt safe walking back to the hotel after the game.As other reviewers have mentioned, this hotel sits in a busy daytime location, but not much going on in the evenings. 5 to 10 min. walk to Quincy Market as well which was convenient. Valet parking at hotel cost was $38 per night, with an extra $6 for early check-in between 12:00  2:00.It would have been nice to have had a Dunkin' Donuts close by but we managed! All in all, a decent stay!

<Content>Loved the Hilton Got an amazing deal on Priceline ($140.00 for Saturday night). Huge, clean corner room with two double beds (No. 1131). Brought our two young kids (9 and 7) for a weekend in Boston. Hilton is 5 to 10 minute walk to Fanuiel Hall, Harbor cruises. 15 minute walk to Little Italy. Just a wonderful stay at a great price. Legal Seafoods is worth the price. Dim Sum at China Pearl 9 Tyler St. was great. Highly recommended.

<Content>Huge double room, very nice, location not great Only hotel available with double room when we booked here. $179 gvt rate. Contrary to another review, our double room was HUGE and very nicely decorated (old world european style, not Sofitel european style). There were two beds, two large chairs with ottomans a large desk and chair with lots of room in between. We had four windows and a nice view of the financial district. Room 1008. The service was excellent, the hotel was clean (I don't think ANY hotel room carpet is clean) and well appointed. The bathroom was nice, toiletries Crabtree  Evelyn. The closet was very small. The beds were ok comfortable but the bedding was excellent. The front desk service was slow but very polite and accomodating except they wouldn't check us in at 2:40 pm with guaranteed check in time of 3pm. The concierge answered phones promptly and easily answered all questions. The doorman was ALWAYS there (the same one most of our stay?!?) They keep 2 cabs outside at all times. Our cab from the airport on Thurs at 2:30pm took 16 minutes, $17 fare. Our cab back to the airport Sunday at 11a took 9 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!! We were told it would take 40+ minutes since the latest big dig disasters. We were pleasantly surprised. Our only complaint other than the check in thing is that the hotel is not conveniently located for subway service. It's way too far to walk to the Back Bay/Copley/Newberry/Beacon Hill areas. We felt safe walking around the hotel at all hours of the day and night with lots of people around at all times, no sketchy types seen in the area at all. The hotel is an easy 5-10 minute walk to Quincy Market, many of the Freedom Trail sites,and the waterfront/aquarium. The North End was a pretty easy 15 minute walk, safe at night. The area seemed to have a pretty hoppin' nightlife. There was a cute pub, Mr. Dooley's right next door but we were always too tired to go in on our way home. It was busy every night. There are no restaurants in the area open for breakfast on weekends except the hotel restaurants. There was a Starbucks and a Dunkin' Donuts close by, though. The bar was open late. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant Sunday morning. The buffet was standard fare so we ate off the menu, also standard fare except I had a fantastic egg white and fresh vegie omelet. The coffee was fine. The service was quite good.  I would have given the hotel an excellent rating except for the check in problem.

<Content>Classy hotel, big suites Stayed here on a business trip as it was the only upper end hotel with rooms. Ended up in one of their suite rooms which was almost bigger than my first apartment. Everything you would expect from a high end hotel including a big comfy bed. Of course you have to pay a premium for such a high end hotel.

<Content>A wonderful 4th of July stay. We had a wonderful stay at the Financial District Hilton. I booked through priceline for 90 bucks a night and we spent 7/3 and 7/4 nights there. We arrived slightly before noon and was told the rooms available were not very nice. They asked me to come back after 2 for a better room. After having lunch in the Chinatown and a walk to the Boston Commons, we came back shortly after 3. There is a different person at the counter. I told her that I was promised a nicer room by the previous staff member. To my surprise, she gave me a King suite on the top 15th floor facing the inner harbor. I was extremely happy. Maybe it's because I presented my AMEX Hilton Honor card for incidentals and parking charge. I don't know.One negative note is the parking charge. It's 38 bucks to park overnight. Since I arrived slightly before noon, I was charged additional 12 bucks for early check in. However it seems the parking valet is contracted out. One positive note. Two days after I come back, I realized I left my cell phone charger there. I called the hotel front desk. The gentleman personally went up to the room and found my charger. He called me back and asked for my address. It was sent to me via DHL next day service. I was thrilled by the friendliness of the staff and the excellent service they provided.

<Content>Excellent hotel, all things considered, including a great Priceline rate! CONS: Upon check-in, we were told there were no non-smoking double rooms. For my husband, me, and our two small children; one king bed was not ideal, and they said they would charge $30 for a roll out bed! Anyway, we took the double room, smoking of course. When we opened the door there were two people inside (!) The room's previous night's occupants had arranged to switch to a different room (not a good sign) and had asked that their luggage be moved from their old room--now our room--to their new room, but no one had done it (another not-so-good-sign). They were very apologetic, they left right away, and they hadn't touched anything in the room, as they had only come back to fetch their luggage. But, a smoky-smelling room with people inside was a big bummer, especially after an already disappointing start.PROS: It was a clean and very nice room, with lots of big windows, awesome beds  linens, lovely toiletries, and almost everything in the room was newly refurbished. The bathroom was nicely redone, but the sink stopper didn't work and at one point later in the day there was no hot water.Everything else about this hotel was excellent. Very good location if you want to be near Fanueil Hall, Aquarium, etc. Staff was courteous, professional, friendly and helpful. The little disappointments did not take much away from an overall great experience.Side note: As a frequent Priceline customer, every now and then I get a sneaky suspicion that I'm being treated like a 2nd class citizen (although our good experiences outweigh the not-so-good). I suspected that perhaps we COULD have been assigned to a non-smoking room with double beds, but being Priceline customers, we were given one of the b-list rooms. I'll never know....

<Content>Don't stay there ever! My sister and I just came back from a two day trip to Boston. We booked the Hilton Financial District through Priceline for $100 a night. We got to the hotel around 1:30pm, after a 4 hour trip from New York, and was politely told by the front desk, that no room was available yet, because they were booked last night. So we had to come back at 3pm, which was to be expected, if it wasn't for the fact that when we did make it back to the hotel at around 3:15pm, there was a 30 min. wait in line to check in! And they had four staff working at the desk. I am not quite sure what kind of issues people were having because our check in literally took less than five minute. Once we got the key cards, and get into the room, we could not believe how tiny the room was! We arranged for a room with two double beds. There was barely enough room to leave the luggage on the floor. Nevermind that there was no desk, or a couch. We brought lunch back to the hotel, and had to eat at the wide sill, since that was the only solution without having to eat on the bathroom vanity.The same evening, we discovered that there was no hot water in the building, and when we called the front desk, we were told that they had no idea when it might come back on. Eventually later that night, the hot water came back on, but it was off again the next morning. Also if I had known better I wouldn't have bidded on the Downtown Boston area, because during the weekend, it's a ghost town, luckily it's walkable to Quincy Market. I usually wouldn't complain about Priceline hotels, since they are such good deal, but the Hilton Fiancial District definitely does not deserve a four star rating. Our stay was barely a two!

<Content>Won't stay here again!!! Our experience at the Hilton was not so great. We made our reservation back in April which at that time it was the Wyndham. I made the reservation directly through the Wyndham website and become a member of Wyndham by request which gave me certain perks such as a snack and drink on arrival, free internet, free local calls and long distance calls, plus 500 frequent flyer miles. I booked the room as a DELUXE two bed room, 460 square feet.......Well, when we arrived, if not for a very nice person from Boston to help us out, we wouldn't have found the hotel because it was now a HILTON. I was never notified in anyway of such a change. We were first given a room so tiny that you could barely squeeze past the 2 double beds. THIS WAS NOT A 460 square foot room! We had a family of 5!! This was all stated on my reservation confirmation print-out which luckily I had with us. The front desk argued with us in giving us a larger room and stated that there would be an extra $75 charge per night for the larger room. We argued right back and were willing to go to the room and measure it to see that it indeed was NOT 460 square feet---we estimated it at being approximately 250 square feet and that's being generous. We could never get a roll away bed in there for our third child. FINALLY, after the front desk person belittled me a bit by saying that 'most people--98%, who are not in the travel industry do not know how to book rooms properly over the internet and this was bascially my fault', we were given a suite which had plenty of room for our family at no additional charge. Also, we were NOT given the perks I mentioned earlier. This was not the greatest way to start out our visit to Boston and I personally will not stay at a Hilton ever again. I would like to say to this front desk person---if so many people are inept at making reservations over the internet---then why offer this service? This was the first time I ever had problems with a reservation on line and I have done it plenty of times!

<Content>Nice rooms, great location, and sweet deal! I got this hotel on Priceline for $135/night for a Friday and Saturday night. I was a bit weary after reading some of the reviews, but my husband and I had an exellent stay. After flying in on a red-eye and arrving at the hotel at 7am we were allowed to check in early and even were upgraded to a king size. We had an enormous adjoining living area (couch, dining table and bar) and the bedroom had a very large comfy bed. Staff was nice, room was clean, and fitness center was free. The hotel is also less than a 5 minute walk to Fanueil Hall, the T, and tons of bars. Only complaint is the restaurant/bar...but there are plenty of other places in the area to eat and drink.

<Content>Great Deal - Great Hotel!!! I am a little prissy about where I stay when on vacation. My boyfriend looked and looked and finally found a place that was in our budget ($135 on priceline for a Saturday night!) and that was in a nice and popular area. Although the room was a little small, it had enough space for the two of us and an incredible bathroom with granite countertops and lots of space. The concierge was very helpful and wanted to make sure we found neat places to visit. We got there a few hours before check-in and they let us drop our bags off in our room anyways. The location was awesome - walking distance to Fanuiel Hall and a cab ride to the North End. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who has good taste and wants exceptional service at a nice hotel.

<Content>Do Not Stay at This Hotel DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL, UNLESS1. You don't mind being ignored and charged $10+ at the bar.2. You don't mind returning to the room after 4 p.m., expecting guests, and find that it has not been made up.3. You don't mind not having enough hot water for the shower in the morning.4. You don't mind the fact that the valet caused more than $1,000 damage to your car.5. You don't mind the fact that the manager gave transparent excuses for not responding sooner to your complaints.Try a tent on the Common the next time you go.

<Content>Great Location but No Housekeeping I visited for a few nights in April on business. I travel often all over the US. The rate I paid was U$171/night. I must say I've driven in many big cities: New York, Philly, WashintonDC but Boston was the most challenging for me. Poor signage, windy roads, tunnels, one-ways  pedestrians darting into the street made me a little on-edge. On to the hotel...Here's what I liked about the hotel:1. Location is great. You can walk to many of the attractions. Beautiful, clean area. 2. Valet, front counter staff friendly and helpful with directions and questions during check-in.3. Quick and efficient service at the lounge/restaurant. Food was above average. Try the strawberry rhubarb dessert! Yum.4. For the business portion we had a dinner in the meeting room. The dinner and service from catering was also above average. A few things I didn't like about the hotel which I see others wrote about are:1. Dark, dingy rooms. I stayed in 1034. I didn't mind the view was a brick wall but as a result it received very little natural light. I little difficult to get good lighting to see anything.2. Housekeeping. I left my room in the morning to go to the conference. I came back to drop off brochures, etc at 1:00pm. The room had not been cleaned. I went for lunch, visited with some friends and came back at 4:00pm to grab my walking map. The room had not been cleaned. I came back to change for dinner at 6:00pm to find my room 'cleaned'. He/She flipped the covers back over the bed and (OF COARSE) took the $10 tip and the pad with 'Thank You' written on it. I couldn't believe it! It made me wonder if the sheets had been changed before my arrival??? The ironing board was left out (I took it out to iron a shirt) and the towels in the bathroom were left on the floor. So much for tipping the housekeeping staff for good service. Perhaps the reason for a dark dingy room? I mentioned the problem to the front desk person on check out. He advised me that I needed to fill out a customer satisfaction card. I said I'm telling him for the hotel's benefit not so I can vent/complain. He again, politely, urged me to fill in the card. I didn't and left to catch my flight. Probably many good, hard-working housekeepers in this hotel but where is the management to ensure quality? I would not stay here again.

<Content>Dirty hotel We recently attempted to stay at the Wyndham in Boston. A few words of advice to future travelers - DON'T GO TO THE WYNDHAM! The hotel was dirty, there were cigarette burns on the blankets, stains everywhere and an empty beer can on the window sill. This place is gross!

<Content>Very Small Room... No Desk We booked our stay at the Wyndham Boston through Priceline. When we arrived they put us in a tiny... I mean tiny room (barely enough room for the two double beds) that had no desk. The hotel had plenty of vacancies (confirmed with a call to the front desk)and would not move us. The view out of the window was a wall... not pretty. Parking is very expensive and the wireless connection costs $10.95 per day. This was definitely not a 4 Star hotel....

<Content>WYNDHAM Great Place to Drown the Shamrock We stayed at the Wyndham Boston for 3 nights for St. Patrick's Weekend booked through Trailfinders with 1 free night. The Wyndham hotel is an excellent hotel in a Good Area near Quincy Market. I had intended booking a Hotel near Back Bay but after going up to The Copley Square area I was more that happy I had made the right decision for our small group. There are plenty of PUBS nearby the Wyndham which was what we were looking for to Drown The Shamrock. It was freezing in Boston but the rooms were warm and clean with good linen, I am sure it would be lovely in the Summer. Tommytourist

<Content>Great for business I have only stayed at the Wyndham for business purposes. Having stayed at half a dozen hotels in Boston, this is definitely the best for business and NOT the best for leisure travel. While it is near certain interesting places, the immediate area is dead at night because it's the financial district. Go elsewhere for vacations.For business travelers, the place is ideal. The customer service is very high, and the rooms are alway comfortable. Sometimes, they were much larger than I was expecting. Never tried the bar/restauarnt but always looked like a good place for a drink.

<Content>Fab Hotel and Location We stayed at the Wyndham for 5 nights in Feb, and could find nothing at all to complain about. The room we had was very spacious, with a really comfy bed. The staff were really courteous and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. This hotel's location is great and is a great base for getting around the city. I would recommend a city trolley tour which was really interesting and you could get on and off wherever you wanted too. If you do go in Feb, make sure you take plenty of warm clothing as when we were there the temperature was well below freezing the whole time.

<Content>Great Location I stayed at the Wyndham 1 night in Feb '06. I was able to take advantage of a great package that is not really published on their web page. Its call the fun package which is really meant for families. However after looking at all the options, even though it was only me and my boyfriend it was still a great deal. The room was 189 and it included an executive suite. This was an amazing room. We were on the top floor. You entered the room to a huge living room with small sink and counter then turned the corner to an even bigger room. We were very amazed at the size of the room and took plenty of pictures to show everyone. Also included with the package was a late check-out of 3 pm. Now for the best part, we got 4 tix for the aquarium (2 adults/2 kids), 4 breakfast buffet (2 adults/ 2 kids), popcorn and an hour of playstation. We were at the very top floor so noise was not a problem. The parking was hefty at $36 but you can take the car in and out as many times as you want for the one fee. The restaurant on site was not that great but there is plenty of other stuff around you. It really is within walking distance to just about anywhere you want to go. I found the staff to be very helpful, I got in at 12 and my room was ready and I was allowed to check in then. I would suggest this place for people that are looking to go to the aquarium, the marketplace and are not afraid to get on a train or bus to copley or the other areas of Boston. If not then maybe you should go to a hotel closer to where you want to sight see. One last thing, the taxis are not that expensive. I took one from the Wyndham to the Museum of Fine Arts and it was $12. Good luck in your travels.

<Content>Enjoyed the Wyndham I found the Wyndham to be a nice hotel overall and I consider it a solid 4 star property. Please note: this hotel participates in Priceline (got it for $75) and in Hotwire so definitely check those sites out if you're looking for a deal. Positives: Lobby area is beautiful Rooms are clean and richly decorated in traditional decor Room service food was good (though overpriced)Staff was kind and welcoming Negatives: Location is good but not ideal... it is between South Station and Downtown Crossing and thus good for business travellers but not quite as ideal for leisure travellersHousekeeping banged on our door 2 times in the morning (they came once at 9 am, I asked them to come back after 12 and they came back at 11 once again) Overall, the Wyndham is a solid choice.

<Content>Very NIce I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The rooms were large with huge windows. Everything was very clean. I was able to get this room online for $149. It was outstanding for Boston at that rate.

<Content>Wyndham Boston- Would avoid The hotel is quite nice, and the front desk was sweet if somewhat befuddled.Initial room in the non-smoking floor smelled of recently smoked pot. Not the hotel's fault, but disconcerting. Back to the front dest, and was given room 412. Not bad, until the boom boom boom of disco-esque music from Umbria across the street. This continued until 2AM, when the hordes of Paris Hilton wannabees let out, and it was not until 2:30 that we got any sleep. I was too frustrated to change the room again.If you stay here, check out the room carefully. Quite honestly, the best thing to do is not stay here, since they weren't up front about an issue that is known to them.Please feel free to email me.

<Content>No parking, treated like a second class citizen Just checked into the Wyndham Boston (literally) and was given a room with two double beds. While this may not seem bad, it started with finding the place. Which is down some dark alley, not to mention there is no parking, only valet service (for $36 a night). When greeted by the front desk, they did not ask us what room preference we had (probably because they had none) as well as would not give us mileage plus miles because we booked through hotwire.I have to say this is ridiculous since we have hotwired many rooms all over the world through hotwire and was able to receive our miles anyways (for instance, the Hyatt in Boston; both the one in near Chinatown and Logan). I did verify on their website that we can't get them because of this, but also they gave us the crappiest of the crap for rooms. It's small, there is a view of a brick wall and our lock is broken. Luckily the internet works or I wouldn't have been able to write this review. Anyway, when I called down right when we got the room to let them know it was two double beds and we would like a queen or king room. They requestioned me to ask if we were the ones who booked through hotwire. Then she changed her answer automatically to There are no kings available. I asked for a queen to find out their hotel only has rooms with two doubles or one king. What kind of hotel is this? Are we in Boston or not? Anyway, I advise against booking with them. Oh and not to mention I agree with another reviewer, the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything going on in the hallways. I forgot to mention that when we hotwired the room, I found out we really weren't getting much of a discount to be treated the way we were because their rates were going for $119 a night and we paid $114. Big difference right? Well in the mean time, that hallway noise is pretty nice at 2:45 in the morning, because we not only heard people coming back to their rooms then, we had loud knocking at our door. When we didn't answer (I thought it was a dream), they started banging again. We answered Hello and they said oh woops...teehhehehee. It was a bunch of drunk girls that couldn't find their room.On top of this I noticed the bathroom sink had toothpaste splattered all over the faucets and apparently no one felt the need to clean it up. Then this morning I go to get in the shower only to have the knob turned ALL the way until it can't go any further and I got lukewarm water dribbling out. It had a Waterpick head that either gave you three dripping streams, one light wide spraying rain, or five more powerful than the other sprays. And lastly, they dropped off our bill in the morning, only to charge us more fees such as convention tax, city AND state occupancy and some other room charge. Which we will obviously have to go down and talk to them about because all fees other than parking we're supposed to be paid for already through hotwire.Ugh....that's about it. Never again will I stay at any Wyndham!

<Content>Great location, lack of service My husband and I decided to spend new year's in Boston. We chose this hotel due to its location. The hotel is within walking distance from Government Center and most of the popular bars in Boston. The hotel service on the other hand was not that great. Every time we asked the concierge a question, they gave us the wrong information and gave us an attitude. The rooms were big but dark. We felt that we were entering a cave instead of a room. But the bed was very comfortable. If location is important to you defenely stay here but if service is a priority go somewhere else.

<Content>Good price and bad breakfast At first sight our suite was disappointing: dark. But the friendly staff brought us two floor lamps - and switch, the rooms looked friendly and well decorated.The regular rooms tend to be noisy (the air condition). The hotel is situated in the heart of Boston so you do not need the car most of the time. The breakfast was very bad and the service as well. The Langham nearby has a wonderful breakfast buffet! We also can warmly recommend high tea at the Ritz Carlton and dinner in the Four Seansons.

<Content>Excellent value In a slightly dull area (for tourists like us, anyway), but what value! Huge room with bed that could easily fit a whole family in it, great bathroom... and one of the friendliest and most helpful doormen ever (didn't get his name, but had a goatee beard). Mightily chilly in Boston in early January, bitter icy wind, so their thermal lights at the entrance were most welcome!! Toasty warm while waiting for car/taxi/deciding where to go. Walking (marching in those temperatures) distance from Common, North End (Italian neighbourhood)and quick hop from Faneuil Hall, with its great food hall, a Cheers bar and Victoria's Secret among other excitements.

<Content>The Perfect Place to Relax The Wyndham Boston is in an excellent location with the markets and other site-seeing spots close by. The reception staff were friendly and the only problem we had (the room they first allocated us already had a guest in it!) was resolved quickly and we were given an upgrade for our inconvenience. The suite we stayed in was very spacious and relaxing. I would definitely stay there again if I was to ever revisit Boston!

<Content>Great Position Large rooms Small Beds Stayed here three nights. Rooms are large with surprisingly high ceilings well decorated but disappointingly small beds (4ft) for a USA hotel. Staff helpful if slightly distant but better than normal for a large inner city chain hotel.We were on 12th floor and still had quite a lot of traffic and pedestrian noise especially Friday night. At the moment ask for a room on the opposite side from Broad street as there is a large building on the other side of the Broad Street just being finished off and the work starts early. Last night spoilt by inconsiderate guests making a lot of noise in the corridor.Join the Wyndham By Request Club you get free phone calls local and national(mainland USA), free internet access, welcome drinks and snack(you specify in your preferences). Hotel has a great position for Quincy market, Fanueil Hall, Aquarium, Downtown area and North Side Italian resturants. Walkable to Boston Common but you would want to take the T (underground) to Theatre district and Backbay shopping area.Parking can be a problem $35 a day if you use the valet parking. Solved this by using all night $7 deal at the Post Office Square underground car park (in before 4pm out before 8am) and the earlybird daytime deal at the multistorey car park at the Aquarium $17 (in before 8.30am out by 7pm) both these are within a couple of blocks of the hotel and driving in this area is much improved since the majority of the big dig is now finished and surface trafic is reduced.There are also some 1 and 2 hour slots to the rear of the hotel and two hour parking meters. Easy driving access from the 93 both north and southbound.

<Content>Most convenient high-end hotel We spent one night in Boston for a party and found the Wyndham on Broad Street. Never knew the hotel was there before, but what a great location. We walked all over the city from the hotel. The room was very quiet, perfectly clean and extremely nice. No view at all, but we got a great night sleep after a late night out at all the places around the hotel. Would go there again and again.

<Content>A good deal, but not worth the trouble. My husband and I stayed for three nights at this hotel, and I have to say that the price was right. But I would have gladly paid a few dollars more to get a decent night's sleep.When we checked into the room, the phone was not working, (bad batteries) the remote for the TV was missing, and one of the lights by the bed was broken. Friendly staff fixed the problems quickly.The room was on the small side, and the bed had seen better days. We were sound asleep at 3:00 a.m. on the first night when the folks next door came back to their room. We woke up to their conversation. It didn't seem like they were talking loudly, but it was as if they were in the same room with us! After a half hour, we called security, and the conversation ended. The next day, the problem continued - when their alarm went off, we heard it in our room. When they used the blow dryer, ditto. And my husband complained, and he's hard of hearing! The lack of any soundproofing was just unacceptable. We won't be back.

<Content>Loved the Wyndham Stayed in the Wyndham for four days prior to thanksgiving. Found the staff friendly and helpful. The rates were good considering that the hotel is right in the centre of the financial district and a few minutes walk from Faneuil Hall and Downtown Crossing (and Filene's Basement!!). Would definitely return.

<Content>Beware of construction noise! Even though I was on the 12th floor and the windows were closed, the sound of trucks backing up woke me up at around 4:30 in the morning.I also found some of the extra fees annoying to put it midly: $10.95 for Internet and it wasn't even Wi-Fi! I had to stretch the cord from the desk in order to sit in the semi-comfortable chair. C'mon guys...this is 2005: WiFi isn't exactly rocket science anymore and while you're at it, I don't like being bilked for accessing my email. Ditto for the parking: at $36 a night, that's pricey, even by Boston standards. No coffee pot in the room, either.I got the room on Hotwire, so I did get a great deal, particularly given the location. But all the excessive fees were annoying.

<Content>Mediocre hotel; good value I recently stayed 2 nights at the Wyndham while visiting Boston for leisure. As the other reviews on this website suggested, by joining Wyndham-by-Request, I got a fantastic last-minute rate (nearly a 60% discount to all comparable hotels).Being unfamiliar with the roads in Boston, it was difficult to locate the hotel (even my GPS was confused by all the road closures). The valet parking was expensive ($36 per night), and it took a LONG time to retrieve my car- apparently the garage is 4 blocks away. For seeing the city by foot/taxi, the location is wonderful, as it is a 3-min walk to Quincy Market and also to the waterfront (where the bus tours start from).Inside the hotel, it is clean and very quiet (this is not the place to be if you want bustling action). The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. Beware of the breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant- it was arguably the worst I've ever had.The hotel room was extremely spacious and clean, but slightly barren with very little natural sunlight. The amenities were great (bathrobes, coffee, iron, bath products, Internet, cordless phone, Aeron, etc). I called to confirm a late checkout on the morning of my departure, but I was denied because it was apparently first-come-first-serve and I asked too late -- even though I specifically requested this when I made my booking.In all, I would say that this hotel is at the low end of the 4* range. However, the rates are unbeatable and therefore make it a good value for the money.

<Content>Best Place to Stay Just stayed Fri to Sat with friends. Best Location to everything. Great service, believe it or not a quiet hotel. Wonderful rooms, Join Wyndham Request and you get even more service. Did a package on line and got a 2 room suite for under 200.00. Wish we booked another nite. So much to do just around the block. We have stayed in Back Bay area, Did New Year's Eve at the Marriott on the Wharf and another time in the summer. Now will only stay at the Wyndham!!

<Content>Great stay at the Wyndham Just stayed the weekend at the Wyndham Boston and loved it. The room was huge (Deluxe King room) and the staff was great. I mentioned that it was my girlfriend's b-day and they sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. What a nice touch! Location is good, near Faniuel Hall and downtown, though I think Copley Square area is more centralized for seeing the whole city. Everything is walkable though. Keep in mind that valet parking there is almost $40/day. Paid under $200/night through their webrates page. All in all a great hotel and highly recommended.

<Content>Great Weekend at the Wyndham Perfect weather and a beautiful spacious room at the conveniently-located Wyndham in Boston. It was a girls' weekend in the city and we started it out  stylin'  at the Wyndham. Our room had a cool view of the clocktower and a round building (although we never did find out what that building is). The Financial District is a bit quiet on the weekends and all of the little deli's closed up on Friday afternoon so be aware of that if you just want a quick sandwich. Faneuil Hall is 2 blocks away though and there are quite a few bars and restaurants within a block or two. The Wyndham service was good but you do pay for them to book you a tour for instance - $2.50 a ticket for a service fee? They also did not tell you they were charging you for the service fee, so be aware if you are booking multiple trips. Go to Faneiul Hall to book these things - they don't charge a cent. No vending machines for soda in the hotel - you have to get room service, which of course is expensive. Martini's in the lobby bar were $13 - although it was very good. I signed up for the Wyndham by Request and did get a welcome snack and the other small things but they would not honor the free breakfast buffet without the internet coupon, which was disappointing because the buffet is $16.50 a person - we did not get the buffet but got breakfast at Caliterra and it was very good. Will stay here again, but will bring some sodas in my suitcase !

<Content>Very nice Feb/March is a good time for hotel rates in Boston as it is freezing and not many want to travel there. I'm a Rewards member and I was updated to an executive suite. Huge bed w/tons of pillows and lovely furnishings/state of the art TV, etc. I also received free breakfasts for being a Rewards member, otherwise would have paid $16. The buffet is a full breakfast (all you can eat style), everything you could want and very nice service.I think I paid around $100 w/tax each night - it's normally close to $200. Not too many complaints - drunks in street below (many pubs nearby), dim lights in bathroom and vanity, sitting area near bar by the door was a little dusty and couch could have used a steam clean, but still ok. Once they know you are a rewards member, you get better service. Doormen/bellhops were very nice, too. The restaurant outside of breakfast is not too great - overpriced California? gourmet or really, they're just trying to get creative and it doesn't really work too well. The Times pub across the street has consistently good food for a decent price if you can handle casual dining.

<Content>Wonderful Just got back from this hotel. We found very comfortable indeed. Great choice for sight seeing Very close to the attractions of boston and we found it to be very quiet. We got a taxi from the airport $25.00 but the sub (T) was very close to the hotel and 2 stops away from the airport at a cost of $2.50 which i would reccomend using. Yes it is also very safe. We found boston a very safe city to walk around freely. This hotel is very close to quincy market where we ate every morning the food hall there is very very cheap and there is a sub around the corner so you are never short of restaurants. Overall the hotel city was better than i expected.The duck tours is well worth doing, we found this better than the city (trolley) buses. One place that i would highly recommend is the Dolce Vita Italian restaurant especially at weekends but please book first as this is very popular. The atmosphere was brilliant with the singing etc This would be first on my list when we return in 2007Happy holidays

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! We stayed at the Wyndham for 3 nights. We were suprised at how big the room was! It was a suite with a large living area and a bedroom separated by a door. The room was very clean, the staff were especially pleasant and helpful and the location can't be beat! We walked to all the major sites. It is also very close to Quincy Market. This is a beautiful hotel with great service - I would stay again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great Location at the Wyndham We stayed at the Wyndham in downtown Boston the week after the Labor day holiday. Everything was wonderful! I couldn't believe how close we were to the Aquarium T stop AND just a few blocks from Quincy Market. Perfect. My husband and I went to Boston for our honeymoon, and the Wyndham was a great choice for hotel. They upgraded us to a suite on the top floor!! The staff were all very nice and helpful, they helped us rent a car to drive to New Hampshire for a day. Simply call the concierge and express your wish. The room was huge, and clean. Our welcome package was awaiting us. (join the reward program with this hotel it is worth it). I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit the lovely city of Boston.

<Content>Wonderful stay! We stayed here for one night to attend a concert at the Bank of America Pavilion. Gorgeous large rooms, helpful staff, comfortable beds, and very clean and safe. The walk to the Pavilion was 10-15 minutes at most. Across the street is a small cafe where you can get french toast, bacon and coffee for only 4.00! Hardest part was driving into the city to the hotel, but that's not the hotel's fault!

<Content>Fantastic stay at the Wyndham What a great hotel. We managed to get a bargain rate, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Our room was massive. It was immaculate, great bed linens and a very comfortable bed.In my opinion this hotel is in the perfect location to explore Boston. We also stayed in the Copley Square area, but I think the financial district has better access to bars and restaurants (especially the wonderful Hanover Street Italian quarter).I wouldn't hesitate to return to the Wyndham or recommend it - it's great!

<Content>Hot no water The Hotel staff were very friendly. I booked a suite and requested a view. I got a suite but a view of a brick building. It was extremely hot and the hotel does not have vending machines. The restuarant does not sell bottled water.

<Content>Great hotel from top to botom From check-in to check-out the experience we had in Boston was truly memorable and the Wyndham had a lot to do with it. The staff was tremendously helpful and very accomodating. There's an air of friendliness that you can't ignore from the staff there and it rubs of on the clientele. Close proximity to Fanueil Hall, Government Center for the Green Line, Aquarium, and a great bar restaurant near the lobby. Nearby was a great lounge called Umbria and apparently there was an Irish pub across the street that pours the perfect pint of Guiness. Would return here in a heartbeat.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed for 4 nights. Very nice room on the top floor (as I had requested) and so a great view of the water and distant airport.Very helpful staff. Ask them to book the Duck Tour for you so that you don't have to queue.Excellent location so that you can walk to all the usual tourist sites.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed here early July with our 2 children. Hotel took pity on us arriving in the middle of the night from Scotland, (delayed 10 hours!), and upgraded us to a suite. So size of room was definately not a problem. Quiet hotel (ie no noise from street as reported in a previous review), friendly, helpul staff and ideal location for sight seeing in Boston.Would definately return.

<Content>great hotel Just returned from a 5 night stay. It was my wife and I's first trip to Boston. The staff could not have been more helpful,especially Rob the concierge. We like large rooms and ours was huge even though it was only a standard. It was within walking distance of every thing we wanted to see. With so many hotels to chose from it was a great choice.

<Content>Clean, Comfortable, Great Location We chose the Wyndham Boston primarily because we were able to use rewards points to cover 2 of our 4 nights and the location looked good. The location was good and the hotel was great; friendly staff, clean, comfortable rooms. We were on the top floor in a corner, so I think our room was a little larger than most and had some character. The windows on the top floor were smaller, but gave us a view of the harbor. Yes, parking would be difficult (as in any large metropolitan city) but it wasn't necessary to have a car. The hotel is conveniently located near the subway and is an easy walk to Quincy Market, Government Center, The Freedom Trail, The Aquarium, The North End and Boston Commons. What more could you want? I would definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>A Fine, Well-Managed Hotel! We had a really great, memorable stay at the Wyndham during a June vacation visit. Every aspect of the stay was perfect, from check-in to check-out. The hotel is in good condition, has a nice historic ambiance, and is perfectly located for city visitors. The large room was a little sparse in furniture, but the wonderful beds made up for it. Very clean. We didn't eat at the restaurant due to schedule, but it looked very nice from the lobby entrance.All the staff members we encountered were very pleasant, excepting perhaps a female concierge who was somewhat aloof. But these exceptions were meaningless in effect on our memorable stay. Hats off to Wyndham's management!

<Content>Our Second Stay Here---In Most Ways, Better than the First We decided to stay at the Wyndham again because we like its proximity to the Aquarium T station which is helpful when flying into Logan. This time, when we made our reservations, only suites were available. While, I'm sure we could have found a cheaper room elsewhere, we decided to stick with the Wyndham. When we checked in, we were pleased to find that our suite was on the top floor with a great view. Plus, it was much quieter than our last stay mainly because we didn't face any bars or clubs. The suites are nice here. There is a sitting room with a wet bar like area and a TV. The bedroom also has a TV. Also, there are 2 bathrobes in the bathroom and an umbrella in the bedroom closet. We're Wyndham by Request members so we got a welcome food tray which isn't as nice at this Wyndham---only a few crackers and some rondele spread but can't complain. The one thing we didn't particularly like was the housekeeping. The strangest thing was that the maid would not take the tip we left for her! I called the front desk about it and they said to bring it to them. When we did, they put it in an envelope and wrote our room number on it. The next day, we arrived back at the hotel just as the maid was finishing up in our suite. Again, I noticed she didn't take the tip so I handed it to her. She also didn't replenish the toiletries, we later discovered, leaving us with only one used bar of soap. When we checked out, we didn't leave a tip. Given the fact that the maid didn't take her tips, we didn't see the point of leaving one since it would be the next people who stayed in the room that would get it. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and helpful. We only ate breakfast one day at the hotel restaurant. You can do so much better elsewhere pricewise. However, eating at the hotel is convenient if you are pressed for time.

<Content>Very good, at great deal Stayed for 3 nights in early July. Very happy with this hotel. Very nice non-smoking room, two double beds requested and received. Staff were excellent and professional. Great location, walking distance to Aquarium and marina. We got a great deal through Hotwire and so we didn鈥檛 qualify for Wyndham-By-Request but that didn't spoil anything.Small picky points were that the fridge in the mini-bar didn't work and there was scaffolding outside the window as contract window cleaners were at work for a few weeks but neither of these bothered us, as we were out all day exploring beautiful Boston.

<Content>Excellent choice The Wyndham Boston was excellent. Without my mention of it, the front desk clerk noticed that it was my birthday during our stay and upgraded us to a suite. Very nice touch (although admittedly we were paying a relatively high rate...the hotel's prebooking discount rate, which was about 50% higher than was to be had on a discounted hotel site like expedia). The concierge was very helpful with anything that we needed. The room was nice, about what you'd expect in a 4 star hotel in a major city. We were on a high floor, away from any local bar noise (and there are several bars close by). The hotel is convenient to the Aquarium as well as Quicy/Faneuil Halls. North End with excellent dining is a short walk away. An excellent location choice is you are OK with not staying in Back Bay/near Copley Plaza.Oh, and parking is very easy, contrary to the previous review from the NY traveller. Valet is the only way to go in a big city downtown hotel. The cost is usually about the same as self park anyway typically. I'm not sure that the hotel warrants a 2/5 rating because the traveller decided not to just go park at the hotel.

<Content>A Nice Place to Stay for Tourists I was happy with the location of the hotel. It is a short walk to Quincy Market which can satisfy anyone's dining needs (fast food or sit down) and a short walk to the Aquarium where you can catch one of several tour trolly tours. All the tours except the Boston Duck Tours seem to start near the aquarium and there are also harbor tours at the wharf.It is easy to catch the T (subway) either at Government Center or at State.Even walking to the North End and grabbing something to eat on Hanover Street wasn't too far. We ate at Pomodoro which had great food. And we tried pastries at a couple cafe's but I have to admit the Mike's Pastry was the best.There are plenty of places to catch a quick breakfast from Dunkin Donuts to small mom and pop cafe's near the hotel. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was that there was:1) no in-room safe (don't all hotels have safes?!?) 2) Only three small drawers for clothes3) A closet which was not enclosed4) Our room was always dark since the room was facing the other side of the hotel (hotel is like a shape of a U and the room was not facing the street, it was on the inner side), but then again we got a cheap rate.5) We had to request 3 extra pillows since pillows not fluffy6) At night on weekends there are lots of bars all over the place especially near Quincy Market so sometimes the crowds spill onto the sidewalks but we never ran into any crazy drunks. But at times we had to walk to the other side of the street or on the street to avoid the crowds but only on Friday and Sat.Overall though we spent 5 nights here and we had no problem getting to all parts of the city and we did have a nice stay here. Oh yeah, a 7-11 is nearby so you can pick up snacks and drinks.

<Content>Parking is a Nightmare The room was nice, but parking was a nightmare! When we found the hotel, it was difficult to find parking near the hotel while trying to maneuver down one-way streets. We finally found a parking garage about three blocks away. My children wheeled their suitcases on the streets to the hotel. Parking fees were $42 for the night, but that was only if we left by 7:00 a.m. The garage charged by the hour after that (I think it was $7 per hour). We entered the hotel at 2:30 after a long drive and were told that we could not register until 3:00. When we asked reception staff about the parking situation, the woman said that we could park ? (somewhere) and the charge would be about $36 for the night. We didn't think the $6 was worth it to walk the three blocks to go park it again. We stayed one night and decided we would find another hotel for the rest of our stay. We definitely would have picked a different hotel if we had known parking wasn't included right next to the hotel. As far as Boston goes, the New England Aquarium was okay, the IMAX movie was great in 3-D, and Quincy Market was fun. We really enjoyed the New England Aquarium Whale Watch and filmed some great footage of many whales! The kids loved that. We did as much as we could before we left the area to find a new hotel. I have never written a review before, but I thought I had to this time. I don't remember anything written on the Wyndham website about their lack of parking and fees to park, so I thought I would let people know. The hotel did offer valet parking, so you might want to have the hotel park it for you if you go.

<Content>Loved Boston- hotel was ok We recently stayed at the Wyndham for a 3 day weekend. We booked on- line (we requested a non-smoking room, I have allergies) and paid for the room in advance. After booking the room I called a few days later to confirm the non-smoking room and to advise of a late arrival(midnight). I was told everything would be fine. Wouldn't you know when we get there they didn't have a non-smoking room available. They did, however, accomodate our original request at 10am the next morning.I wasn't happy about the fact they somehow got our reservation request messed up and with the service (or lack of) that we received from the front desk. I felt like we were being was ignored. Let me add that we were being very nice about their mix up.The room was small but comfortable. The front desk staff was not very helpful or friendly. Housekeeping was excellent and very nice. The hotel is in a good location, a few blocks from Fanuel Hall and other historical sites. We had a blast at the Red Sox game on Friday night.The Freedon Trail is a must , take a little detour and visit Mike's Pastry in the North End- you'll thank me later. Also great Italian food in the area!We loved Boston and like to go back.

<Content>Great place to stay. The hotel was immaculate, the service was friendly and room was huge. And best of all, the location is fantastic, close to both Quincy Market, the Freedom Trail and the waterfront. We were only there for a couple of days but ended up wanting to stay longer the place was so nice.

<Content>Wow I left a sparkling review for this hotel earlier but I forgot to mention one important thing. I was so excited to start sightseeing the day after we checked in that I accidently left my wallet with several hundred dollars in it, not to mention my checkbook and credit cards, in my room on the nightstand. I didn't even realize that I had left it there until I returned to the room and saw my wallet sitting there. I was afraid to look inside because I did this in Mexico and they left me $3. I was so impressed when all my money was still there. Thank you to a very honest housekeeping person. A tip: the elevators don't work until you slide your card through. I reported a broken elevator to the front desk my first day. OOPS! And I read someone complained about the unfriendly doorman. We had 2 doormen in our 3 days and they were overly friendly and helpful, as was every person we encountered there. We also signed up for the Wyndham by Request and that is a great thing!! They had a bottle of Cabernet waiting for us in the room and a plate of chocolate chip cookies for the kids. Our room was $249 a night but included breakfast buffets for 5 each morning ($60 value) and 4 2-day goboston passes ($220 value) WHICH ARE A DEAL! We practically got paid to stay here! A great value in any book!! My husband dropped us off at the hotel and returned the rental car since we knew it was expensive to park and we planned on walking or using the T. This actually was difficult for my husband since driving in Boston is complicated. We found the hotel easily. Finding his way back to the Thrifty car rental place in Revere was more challenging. He eventually found it, by driving to the airport and following the Thrifty shuttle to Revere and then he took the T back to the hotel and said that was easy. All around a fabulous place to stay. Very comfy beds and I loved the robes! I used it every day!!

<Content>A great hotel We booked through Hotwire. We really didn鈥檛 have a clue about hotels in Boston and there was so much - too much 鈥?choice. So when we saw a 4* hotel on Hotwire, with three rave user-reviews and in a central location, booking seemed a good idea. We weren鈥檛 disappointed. My husband travels a lot for business, usually in 4* hotels, and even he was very pleased with the Wyndham.Every member of staff we dealt with was excellent. They obviously choose and train them well. I think our room must have been one of the smaller ones mentioned in other reviews as it certainly wasn鈥檛 huge but it was more than ample for the two of us and had a wonderful king bed with lots of pillows and a very comfortable firm mattress..  We weren鈥檛 facing the building work so can鈥檛 comment on the noise as we didn鈥檛 hear any. We appreciated our glimpse of the harbour and airport island between the buildings opposite as the sun on the water and the sunrise was so pretty. Of all our New England hotels, the Boston Wyndham had the quietest air conditioning. Something that became very clear to us as we travelled as it set too high a standard. We spent a few sleepless nights yearning to be back at the Wyndham!The housekeeping service was immaculate. It really couldn鈥檛 be faulted on any day in any way.Both the desk chair and armchair were very comfy.As Dara Metteucci, (the ByRequest Manager), informed us, we didn鈥檛 qualify for Wyndham-By-Request as we鈥檇 booked through Hotwire. However, Dara, still made sure we received the non-smoking room we required (I have asthma) and we were made to feel that nothing would be too much trouble. Excellent service.One of the best things though had to be the location 鈥?it really couldn鈥檛 be beat. Close to Quincy Hall, the Aquarium, the Freedom Trail, two T-stations, numerous food and drink possibilities 鈥?what more could we have wanted? I've justifiably given 5* but we did have a couple of minor gripes. The first being the towel situation. There weren鈥檛 any by the vanities. You had to wash your hands in one room, then run dripping to another to dry them in the bathroom 鈥?which didn鈥檛 have enough towel rails anyway... not very 4*.I had to take things out of the advertised fridge in order to put anything in it. But if you鈥檙e looking for a well-stocked mini bar, the Wyndham鈥檚 your hotel!Would we stay at the Boston Wyndham again? Most definitely. In a heartbeat.

<Content>Good hotel in financial district For a recent three-day weekend trip, the Wyndham was exactly what we expected for the price; a clean, good-sized room, polite staff and a great location in the Financial District for exploring the city on foot. I wouldn't want to drive or park there, but for walking around to the famous sites like Quincy Market, the North End and over to the Back Bay, its location was excellent. Five blocks to a T stop and the wharf where the harbor cruises leave, it made for a very nice long weekend. We didn't try the restaurant outside of one room service breakfast which was delivered quickly and was delicious. While it wasn't anything that bothered us, this is a city hotel and there is ambient noise outside at night that might bother you if you aren't used to the city. A few pubs around the hotel had good crowds on the weekend we were there, and if music from them drifted up to our room on the 15th floor, I imagine it was louder below us. Just something to keep in mind if you don't live in or regularly stay in a city environment.

<Content>Wonderful service, great location The staff at this hotel is wonderful, we had been in an accident and called to cancel our reservation. They offered to refund our money despite the fact that the reservation was for that day and it was a non-refundable internet deal. The next morning we decided to go on our trip anyway and rebooked with the hotel (getting an even cheaper rate than before). We arrived before check-in time so they held our bags and wished us a wonderful day. The staff was quick to provide us with walking or driving instructions that were easy to understand and everyone was very pleasant. We had only two complaints. The weather had turned sharply colder that day and we returned to a freezing hotel room. They were having an AC problem and couldn't warm the building up so they sent up extra blankets that were toasty warm. My other complaint is that if you are a small eater or have children look elsewhere for breakfast as it is very expensive here. My daughters loved their waffles and stuffed french toast but the buffet was very small for the price. This was our most expensive meal of the trip and we ate at nice resturants all week.This hotel is a bit trickey to get too since it is in the middle of the massive road work going on but arriving on a Sunday helped with the traffic situation. But it's location is wonderful for sightseeing since it is 3 blocks from Fanuiel Hall and the Aquarium. We walked everywhere and being it was so late when we returned to our hotel we used a taxi rather than the T.This is a wonderful hotel and with internet rates we managed to get a room for $161 on a weekend. We will most definitely stay here again.

<Content>Enjoyed the Wyndham We spent four nights at the Wyndham. Had a lovely big room. Corner view with a plethora of windows. Comfy bed. High floor as asked for in Wyndham by Request. Tea and Coffee a in room a lovely change from most American hotels. Bar was nice. Friendly service. Check in courteous and efficient, just what you neeed after a seven hour flight. Brilliant location. Perfect for an early morning walk to the sea. Please please eat and drink at Mr Dooleys bar next door. Truly superb. A proper Irish bar. Really enjoyed everything about Boston.

<Content>Really Nice Hotel Pros: The location was great - very close to Quincy Market and the waterfront. It was easy to walk to and from the T station and the neighborhood was safe and well lit. Everything went really smooth at this hotel. We prepaid and booked our rooms early. No hassles or mistakes at check in or check out. It couldn't have gone smoother. I joined the Wyndham By Request club prior to going and had extra towels and snacks in the room when we checked in. We also got the use the late checkout because we had joined their club (it was free to join). The elevators were quick and there were plenty of them. The room itself was huge. We had a standard room with 2 double beds. We were in a corner room so maybe it was bigger than most but we had so much room. You could have easily fit 2 additional double beds in our room and still had room to walk around. The bathroom was big and clean. Free newspaper every morning is left outside your door. The front desk people were very helpful - when I asked about buying a 3-day subway pass, they asked me if we were really going to use the subway that much. They explained the price and asked if we were going to be walking alot or really using the subway. Turned out, it was much cheaper for us to pay as we went and not buy the pass, because we did so much walking! Cons: No in-room safe, not enough drawers to store clothes. The room probably seemed so big because there was no storage in the room. Parking at the hotel is really expensive. There seemed to only be one valet and when we got there, we waited out front for about 5 minutes and no one was around. It was pretty fortunate because we ended up parking a few blocks away at a public lot for less than the hotel was going to charge us - and we had full access to our car anytime we wanted it. We didn't use the room service - with so many bars and pubs and the market nearby, we didn't want to eat at the hotel. Overall, this was a very nice hotel. I would stay there again if I could get the same deal I got this time (by pre-paying and booking in advance). Everyone was really nice.

<Content>A little dissapointing We just returned from an extended weekend at the Wyndham Boston. We booked this hotel because of the many good reviews, but unfortunatelly we were not so lucky. Maybe we should have signed up for the By Request programm. We arrived around midnight, the Valet Parking person came to our car and told us in a very unfriendly way that the parking is $36 per day and that we have no other choice. We knew about the Post Office parking someone suggested here, but at that time of the day we just didn麓t want to go there. So we agreed to the valet parking. There was no staff helping with our luggage and we felt rushed by the valet parking guy to get our stuff out of the car, so that he can park the car. Front desk was OK, but again no help with our luggage on the way up to our room. The room ($ 178.00 plus taxes) was very small and dark, our bed was not comfortable at all, mattress was not firm and none of the 6 pillows was good. The view (11th floor) was not nice and we heard the noise of the aircondition vents all night. The bathroom was very small, too. The good thing about this tiny room was, that it was very well maintained and clean and after all, we only were in there at night, so we did not ask for another room.The hotel restaurant is OK. We had breakfast there every day since the places around the hotel are closed over the weekend. We ordered from the menu and food was great, buffet looked good, too, very friendly waiter. We had dinner there once. The food was good, but the waiter we had almost ruined our evening. He had an attitude and is in need of further training I believe. We noticed that other guests served by this waiter were not happy as well.Over all, this is a good hotel and the location is close to many sights. Maybe our expectations were a little bit high from all the nice reviews and it somewhat depends on the people who work there at the time of your stay. If we decide to stay there again, we will make sure to get a better room in the first place and maybe sign up for their By Request programm.

<Content>Excellent Hotel in the Center of Everything Stayed here Memorial Day weekend--2nd time in this hotel on a Priceline stay. Service: 4*Room: 3 1/2 *Food Service: 3 1/2*Overall: 4*Overall, an excellent visit. Wonderful early check-in, clean and convenient room, helpful staff. Concierges good but not great, you generally got the feel you were wasting their time. Housekeeping also good but not great, missed adding new TP and Kleenex (though staff quickly replaced). For the location (close to everything), facilities and staff. Overall, well worth the bid--we'd definitely stay again.

<Content>Very good hotel in excellent location Just spent 8 days at the Wyndham. Great location with close proximity to Quincy Market and the Harbourfront area. A visit to the Caliterra restaurant is well worthwhile with good food, portions and staff.Tried to get Red Sox tickets since April unsuccessfully. A quick call to the concierge provided us prime seats behind the dug out the afternoon before the game. Many thanks!Only downside was lack of safety deposit box availability which in no way spoiled our stay!Would definitely stay again.

<Content>Great hotel! We had a great weekend stay at the Wyndham. Wyndham By Request is the way to go--definitely sign up! The location was great, I don't know what people are talking about in the reviews that say it's dead on the weekends. There are plenty of bars in the neighborhood (we didn't have any problem at all with noise, either, as mentioned in other reviews) and it really is a quick walk to pretty much everything. Boston is such a great walking city! I always tend to look around at other hotels when I go places to see if I would do anything differently after I know the city a bit better, and I didn't see any hotel that seemed more appealing. I would definitely stay at the Wyndham for my next trip to Boston.

<Content>Nice Hotel, great location The Wyndham is a very nice hotel that has an excellent location by the harbor. The Hotel has an old Boston look and feel but rooms blend in modern amenities. Small front desk, check in went smooth. Bell hops and cabs waiting for you at the door.My first impression was the room was small. The comfortable king bed seemed to take up half the room. This hotel was built well before the age of mega suite hotels, and it wasn't bad at all. Everything is nicely renovated, I believe recently.Wyndham by Request had a bottle of beer on ice, snack, extra feather pillows, room on a high floor that I could smoke in, that was away from the elevators, and a local newspaper (even the $2.50 Sunday Globe)..all exactly as I selected on their web site, and all free.The work desk was decent and functional and the ergo chair is just like you have at most offices. Wireless phone and ethernet on desk.Free phone calls, high speed internet, bottled water and coffee, nice. Contrary to one review, the rooms do have drawers to put your clothes in! You can also open up a window if you like and hear the city (it's quiet on the weekends though). No in room safe, in the basic room at least. It's good that the elevator won't let you punch a floor without putting in your key first.The view was of historic buildings in front of a modern skyscraper, as well as the harbor where you could see boats and Logan airport.Room service has good food and is prompt. Make sure you're ready to open the door 5 minutes after you order breakfast!Maid service does a nice job, refreshes everything. I think you must hang the service room tag on the knob or they won't come in. Bathroom has nice marble tile and strong shower head, big clean tub.I went to the restaurant on site, Caliterra, and just had something at the bar since the restaurant is closed after breakfast till dinner. It was the best bar food around and a good indicator of what a dinner must be like. They give you a mystery discount envelope to the restaurant upon checkin that is good for anywhere from 10 to 100 percent off a meal.Concierge has a map and will hand draw you directions to get started.You can walk to many pubs and restuarants VERY easily and safely. Fanuel Hall marketplace nearby has nice restaurants that do seafood in a Boston way. Go to McCormick  Schmick's and order a 1.25 lb lobster and a bowl of clam chowder and you'll know what I mean. Tour boothes all over the marketplace for duck boat, big harbor boats, trolleys, etc. The aquarium is near, look for the rockhopper penquins, sea lions and a 60 year old sea turtle. The area is also great for young singles on Fri and Sat nights.The Freedom trail is kind of long. If you get tired just make it to the next location and a cab might be around to bail out. The hotel and Fanuel Hall are at its mid point. Bunker Hill at the end was very interesting and you can climb up the monument, which looks like the Washington monument in DC, but much smaller. Just a fairly important note about Beantown weather, good luck! I went when it was a classic Boston hazy, hot and opressively humid weekend. Even if you're from the deep South you will hate it. The hotel a/c isn't powerful. They do get cold fronts, so if your stay is long enough one will blow through and it will be beautiful after.

<Content>The Wyndham was great! We just got back from a three night stay in Boston. We stayed at the Wyndham which we would highly recommend. On the advice of other travellers in this forum we joined the Wyndham By Request scheme, and on our second day I thought it was worth asking for an upgrade as we have two teenagers and they didn't want to share the other double bed. This request was granted right away and we moved to a two room suite at no extra charge. The lifts require a card swipe to access all floors, which is an excellent security measure. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was ideally situated for the Aquarium, Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market. I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great place to stay We just came back from a 3 day trip to the Boston area. The location of the hotel was fine. The hotel was very friendly and aimed to please. At first, we took a different stop from the T location but found a closer one at the Aquarium. This hotel is just a few block walk from the Waterfront. We did the Old Town Trolley which was great because you could ge on and off and see different sites around Boston. We drove in from a friend's event in New Jersey and dropped off our car at the airport. We were glad we did since Boston is a very compact, walking friendly city. My son and I were able to get tickets to a Red Sox game one night which was very exciting. We had a wait in a long line for 1 1/2 hrs, but it was worth it even though they lost. We can't wait to visit the Boston area again, three days was not enough.

<Content>Wyndham - Great Location! My husband and I just returned from a 4-day weekend in Boston and had a great time. We stayed at the Boston Wyndham and found it was close to many of the attractions, especially Fanueil Hall/Quincy Market. We took many of the reviewers' advice and signed up for the Wyndham By Request. We were able to check-in at 10:30am when we arrived and later in the afternoon received our complimentary snack and drink. The staff was very friendly and always willing to help with any questions. The only thing we found that our room did not have were drawers to keep our clothes in, so we had to live out of our suitcases. Other than that, our room was very clean and quiet. Some suggestions for those going for a long weekend trip....Book the Beantown Trolley Tour. It is the only 2-day tour you can get on and off the trolley at the different stops. Buy your tickets at the Wharf, not the concierge - they only have 1-day passes. We used this as our main transportation for the first two days and we saw basically everything without getting too overwhelmed. Walking the Freedom Trail also helped.If you go to Salem, take the Trolley Tour. This gives you the basic idea of the city and you can get on and off the trolley. You will have to take the train to get to Salem, too. This was very easy and the concierge gave us train times and directions. If you are looking for a few nice dinner restaurants, we loved Legal Seafood (at the Wharf) and Plaza III Kansas City Steakhouse (at Fanueil Hall/South Market). Both were very good. Plaza III is pricey, but well worth the money! Also, if you are going during baseball season, you will have to buy a Red Sox hat, T-shirt, etc. It is all over the city and you will defintely catch the fever! Go to a game, too. It was so much fun and there are plenty of bars around the park to go to before and after (Game On and Cask 'n Flagon were our favorites).

<Content>Fantasic Staff Our stay at he Wynham - Boston was a real treat. The weather was not pleasent, but the staff at Wynham was outstanding. We had a few needs, and the staff could not have been more accomadating. Very friendly, informative and a joy to be around. We had spent a week at Wynham - Andover and decided to stay a night in Boston. The staff at both Wynham's were outstanding. I would stay at any Wynham hotel again. THE BEST.

<Content>We will be back! Just returned from a weekend in Boston with a stay at the Wyndham. What a great find! THE best price for a GREAT room in a GREAT location. We parked our car in the Post Office Square parking garage and walked a very easy couple of blocks to the Wyndham. This saved a bundle on parking since the weekend rate at Post Office Square is only $7/day. Even though it was a wet, cool, and windy weekend in the city, we walked to Quincy Market, the North End, Filene's Basement, etc. It was a short walk to the T which we took to Fenway for a baseball game. Took a cab back to our car after the game (about $10) and worth every penny rather than standing in a looong line at the T. The breakfast at Caliterra was very good and couldn't be a better bargain with a coupon for one free buffet. The front desk staff were so helpful with directions and advice. We were upgraded to a 2-room king suite with a wonderful view looking out towards Quincy Market and North End. Our Wyndham By Request cheese and Chardonnay were waiting for us in our suite as was our customized bed. Wyndham has got the whole customer loyalty program down to a science and have won over these two very local Wyndham customers. I tell anyone who will listen to how great this hotel chain is!

<Content>The Wyndham was Wonderful!! We just came back from 4 days at the Boston Wyndham. First time visit for our two children (age 10 and 13). The room was very nice. Very very comfortable beds, (we had 4 people in 1 room) (2 adults in 1 bed and 2 children in other bed). Marble bathroom was very large and CLEAN! Only complaint was the water pressure in the shower - (they had a note about water conservation hanging in the bathroom). The staff was very friendly and accomodating. Definately go on line and join Wyndham By Request, it is totally free and offers you various choices for your stay (extra towels, late check out, welcome snack, etc.). We did not have the best weather, 3 out of the 4 days is rained, but we kept busy our entire stay! Hotel is really in great location - convenient to Quincey Market and the T - which is easy to follow and takes you everywhere (alot cleaner then NY subway). Our highlight of the trip was the Duck Tours - they book up quickly but really try and book ahead if possible!) We were recommended to try a restaurant in the North End called Artu - food was absolutely delicious, tasted homemade and a wonderful menu. After dinner go to Mike's down the street for pastries, again, you may have to wait in line, but worth the wait because this bakery is really good. For the price, the Wyndham was a wonderful hotel. We will definately go back!! Check it out, and enjoy Boston!!

<Content>Great hotel Just returned from the Wyndham for the weekend with four friends. Great hotel! We got it for $117 a night (go to their website and select Webrates) which was a bargain in comparison of the other hotels. Make sure to sign up for the Wyndham By Request; it's free and you receive some good benefits. The hotel was clean, the rooms gorgeous, and the staff very friendly  helpful. We ordered room service twice and the food was good. Three pubs/restaurants within one block of the hotel. It's about 3 or 4 blocks to Quincy Market. Make sure to do the Boston Duck Tour while there; great tour of the city and the Charles River - ask the concierge to reserve you a ticket as it fills up fast. Just a note: if you go on the weekends, that area is pretty much shut down in terms of delis, etc

<Content>Fantastic hotel Stayed at the Wyndham Boston over Easter weekend and got the room on priceline for 拢50 per night. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite with a king bed. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Faneuil Hall  Market (great food and shopping) and also within easy reach of most of the major Boston/Cambridge attractions. Good area, clean rooms, good size bathrooms, lovely beds and the hotel staff was very friendly and curteous. All in all a fantastic experience.

<Content>Great Stay But not the Buffet What a great hotel!, From our arrival with the greeting from the Doorman that took care of the valet parking,just pay the price it's the same at surrounding hotels.We had a suite that was great. very clean and roomy. King bed was comfortable. Our package included the Boston Go Cards that gives you free admission to more sights than you'll ever have time for. We spent one full day just at the Science Museum. Plus the Beantown Trolley that takes you on a two hour tour.A lot of attractions start up later in the spring as the weather gets warmer. Walked to the Aquarium,and Quincy Market. Eat at the Market ,can't go wrong with all the choices you have. Dinner at Union Oyster House was Great. The Hotel staff was great,any question was answered promptly. The only complaint was with Breakfast Buffet. We had free passes for two adults and two children for two mornings. The first day we were seated, coffee and juice poured,and as soon as I gave the waiter the passes he was gone.Busy taking care of (Paying Customers). I had to get our own water and extra napkins for the kids, couldn't get their attention.I left a small tip because I knew We'd be back the next day. Day two the Host asked upon our arrival, you have passes right? Here we go again. We were sat farther in the back, had the same Waiter, and even worse service. This time he didn't even leave the pot of coffee on the table.As we looked around everybody else had water and coffee pots on the table. Same thing couldn't get their attention,this time the tip reflected the service (Zero). I would stay here again but would go outside the hotel to eat, very easy to do.

<Content>Wondrous Wyndham The Wyndham is a great choice when traveling to Boston. It is a very close walk to Quincy Market, the Aquarium, and the T. It is also a short walk to Washington St. where the infamous Filenes Basement is. There are tons od restaurants/ bars in the area. Definitely think about signing up for the Wyndham by Request before you visit. In the afternoon there were complementary treats waiting for us. The staff was very helpful and kind. They will hold your bags after check out for no cost. The room was well decorated and the marble bathroom with complementary bath toiletries was quite lovely. There is 24 hour room service with reasonable prices and good food. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Have a fantastic trip!

<Content>Hidden Treasure Surrounded by glitzy boutique hotels, the Wyndham in downtown Boston turned out to be an amazing hotel. The staff was extremely friendly, the food first class, and the room, a suite, well laid out and comfortable. The location is ideal for those visiting on vacation, as it is steps away from Faneuil Hall, or those with business downtown.

<Content>Great Family Fun Package!! We Stayed at the Wyndham Boston on February 12, 2005. We found the the Family Fun Package. It's hard to get. The accommdations were great!! A luxury suite Choice of tickets for children's museum or the aquarium for two adults, two children. It's also included a Breakfast buffet for two adults, and two children, soda and popcorn delivery and One hour of PlayStation庐 or an in-room movie (value of $13.00) and late check-out 3 p.m. ALL FOR $189 per night w/o taxes. It's in walking distance to the aquarium and train station and other attractions. The hotel was great. No pool and gym is tiny. The aquarium was the main reason we went to Boston.The aquarium has three types of live Penguins- little blue, African and Rockhoppers that was great experience! For all you penguin lovers a must see!!! Overall this aquarium is small but great experience!!!

<Content>Better than we expected-parking garage info.. We recently stayed at the Wyndham Boston 2 weekends in a row and dont understand how anyone could write bad reviews on this hotel. First of all if you plan on staying here definitly join the Wyndham by request program. Its fantastic! We got a 2pm check out both times which was really great. The second weekend that we stayed there we got to our room and they had upgraded us to a suite without us even knowing. The rooms are really nice and its very convenient to a lot of major boston attractions. We live in Massachusetts and will continue to come back to this hotel whenever we decide to go into the city. As far as parking goes...if you dont want to pay $35 for valet parking...park at the Post Office Square Parking garage...its only $7 a day on the weekends...and its only a couple blocks away. Ask for a room on one of the top floors if you really desire a decent view. The hotel is only 15 floors so its not like you're looking over the city. But we stayed on the 8th floor and we werent staring at a brick building. The room itself was really nice. 10 foot ceilings and lots of room.

<Content>Good job Wyndham Boston! I recently spent an enjoyable weekend (2 nights) at the Wyndham Boston hotel. The room was very fairly priced (about $70 per night less than many comparable hotels). You should know that the area in which the hotel is located is rather quiet during the weekends since it really is the central business area for the city. That being said, Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market is only a short walk away. I was promptly (they were almost tripping over each other to help me!) greeted in a friendly manner. The room was very spacious and clean. In fact, it appears to have been recently renovated (or they just do an incredible job maintaining the rooms!). My ByRequest welcome snack of fresh fruit and diet soda was very generous (a banana, apple, orange, pear and strawberries along with two bottles each of soda and water - all this for free!). The hotel was very quiet and I enjoyed 2 peaceful nights of rest. The hotel manager called the first day we were there to see if there was anyway she could do to help us/improve our stay...what a very nice touch! My only complaint is about housekeeping after the first night. The housekeeper forget (I presume) to leave new soap and facecloths. Otherwise, the room was very clean. I highly recommend this hotel to you and can't wait to return myself! Oh, and Boston is a great city too!

<Content>Great Hotel My Son and I stayed 8 nights in February. He was starting a new job and Apartment wasn't ready for another week. I was just visiting. Love Boston. Booked a room with two doubles, but as a By Request member, we were upgraded to a suite. Was wonderful as we were there for so many days. Staff was more than friendly. Perks are amazing. Free high speed internet, free long distance, free wine and snacks upon arrival. free faxes and copies. On way back to airport at rush hour on friday evening, bellman couldn't get a cab right away, so somehow this huge sedan pulled up and took us to the airport. Don't know where it came from so fast but was very impressed. Will always stay here when in boston, easy to walk everywhere. Someone wrote T stop was only 2 blocks away. Never found that one, but not to far to walk to the ones we found. Also, price was great. Only paid $99.00 AAA rare for all 8 nights. In a suite! Amazing!

<Content>Good choice - by Boston standards (I say by Boston standards because lodging is ridiculously expensive in Boston for what you often get. If it wasn't for Hotwire, I probably would have opted for a cheaper hotel...we paid $119 + $20 tax; a bargain for a 4-star hotel.)  I work in Boston and we live about 30 miles away; this wasn't so much for sightseeing (though the location is great - near the Aquarium and Faneuil Hall) as it was having a romantic pre-Valentine's weekend in the city. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the area around the Aquarium had become more visitor-friendly and had restaurants, bars, etc. and that the place didn't become eerily deserted on the weekend. If, like us, you're somewhat local, here's a tip: park at an MBTA station and take the train in. Otherwise, it's $35 to park a car that you won't be driving while you're in Boston.  Also, don't assume that those bottles of water in your room are complimentary - we drank a 16 oz. bottle before realizing that they were $3.50 apiece.   This was a very clean, nicely decorated, and quiet room on the 9th floor (may not be the case during the week as the room faced a construction site). The staff were all pleasant and helpful. My only real gripe was that room service knocked on our door twice - to deliver food for the people next door. (Honestly, the room numbers are posted right on the wall!) Each time - once late at night and the other time, early in the morning - they woke us up. But it wasn't worth complaining about.  We didn't sample Caliterra (the restaurant downstairs), but we had the Financier's Breakfast (eggs/toast/bacon/hash browns + juice + tea or coffee) for $11.50 apiece...a bargain compared to the a la carte cereal ($4) or other items. But after factoring in tax, $3 delivery charge and 16% gratuity, you're better off wandering down the street to have brunch in one of the local restaurants.

<Content>Beautiful hotel and central to everything! Ok, if I hadn't had a couple of problems in the booking process, I'd say the stay was excellent. But somehow a booking for the internet rates for 2 nights and 1 night of special family package got a bit discombobulated. A deluxe room came with the family package, and I signed up for the hotel's club too, to get any upgrades I could. So I paid for a 3 night stay, which got billed wrong, so I should have noticed it when I saw the original billing, cuz I paid what I was supposed to, but it said 3 nights internet plan. But when we got there, they had it in their notes that I had the family plan, and gave us a deluxe room on the top floor, with all the club upgrades, and didn't deliver any of the package deals with it. Weird. So I was complaining that although the room was nice and HUGE, and we had two small kids there spreading out all their toys and clothes, that there was no tickets to the aquarium, and that we were supposed to get a free breakfast. They said they'd credit us back the price of the aquarium tickets, so to go ahead and buy them cuz they were out of vouchers, and they'd credit them. Then, they gave us the tickets to the breakfast. Then my girlfriend wanted a rollaway bed, and they gave it to us for free in the end when the on demand movies went out on us, and we were all set to watch a movie. We wanted our popcorn and drinks too, and they kept saying they had it in their notes that we were only supposed to get the internet rate, and couldn't understand what was going on. I was having a headache explaining it over and over again to at least 5 people. I was getting half the stuff, and not everything. And then they kept saying that I got all these things for free, and I was saying that 'NO, I paid for them, it comes with the package I paid for. In the end, we got most of it, or the equivalent. But I do need to mention that the rooms were really nice, and clean, and although there was construction going on outside our window, I didn't hear a thing really, cuz we weren't in the room when they were banging away. And I thought it was pretty well insulated. It had started to snow the first day we were there - we went in mid-Nov. And it was so cool to be on the top floor and see nothing one day, and then see the rooftops filled with snow the next morning. We were SO close to the aquarium and Faneuil, it made it bearable when we were walking with toddlers in the ice. They were so cold, but the walk was only 2-3 blocks, so I can't complain.  The food in the restaurant was phenomenal for dinner. I treated myself to a nice dinner, and it was really good. The breakfasts are more costly, so I'm glad it ended up being free. I had heard it was expensive to eat in Boston, but it wasn't any more than other places I've traveled to.   OH - special mention! We tried a Legal Sea Foods, on my brother's recommendation, and it was really good too. I saw the line and heard there was a 45 minute wait, and wasn't sure what to do. We didn't know of anyplace close by, and figured on walking somewhere else, then turned back and went in anyhow. The host saw us with the two small kids, freezing and hungry, and I guess he took pity on us, and while he told us we would have to wait at least 45 minutes, he came over within 10 minutes and gave us a corner table in the far back of the restaurant. We gladly took it, it was perfect. It even had extra room in back of us for us to throw all our shopping bags and strollers so they were out of the way of everyone. They must save that table for families. I can't speak more highly of that host, and should have tipped him!! But this is the location right next to the aquarium, and I didn't expect any special courtesies, but they were sure family friendly. they also had great kids menus. Anyhow, sorry I digress....  The hotel was so close to the restaurant though, that if you stay there, and you have a family to feed, that's the place to go that won't break the bank, and had great food, and was convenient and friendly.  Hotel staff was overall courteous, and the guys out in front are wonderful, and always got a taxi quickly, and helped us pack our car when we left. Man, they're awesome! They got a tonload of stuff, ice chest, luggage, stroller, all back into a small trunk. Previously, we had to put the stroller in the front, which was not comfortable. I don't know how the guy did it, but boy, we were sure happy when he got it all to fit. We didn't dare open it for any reason other than when my girlfriend dropped me and my daughter off at the airport.  I'd definitely go back again. But this time I know not to try and combine packages. I'd just do either the package, or the internet rates. It's probably myfault for the mess, and I gotta admit I was stressing during some of the stay, but I think it was partially my fault. And they did try to make good on everything. So, a 5 rating goes to effort on their parts - but they need a better booking system.

<Content>Recommended Stayed at the Wyndham at the end of Jan for 2 nites. Unfortunately, same 2 nites that Boston experienced their biggest snowstorm since 77.  Given the situation, we actually had a very good time. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is in an area slightly removed from the action but only 10-15 min walk gets you most anywhere in downtown Boston you want to be (Commons, Quincy, Faneuil, theatres...). The room was very nice and the breakfast is amazing (rasberries in Jan!!!) but somewhat expensive at $15/pers (children are almost free though). The concierge was very friendly but wasn't very knowledgeable about what was open and closed during the storm. Everyone else at the hotel was warm and helpful.  We didn't hear anything from adjoining rooms as others have mentioned. There was a small gym/sauna downstairs but unfortunately no pool. Everything in the hotel was very well kept and comfortable and of course the By Request refreshments on arrival adds a nice touch. The neighbourhood also felt very safe at night.  Overall, I'd recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a really nice place to stay at a reasonable rate.

<Content>Brill Location This was our first trip to Boston, the location was ideal,room was very good, you are mins to excellent food places and shops.The hotel was within walking distance to the T(Trains) which take you to all key places.Staff were friendly and helpful.If you intend to go at this time of year make sure you take warm jackets etc,I have never felt cold like it, although you soon forget once you are walking,plenty of coffe shops to have a break. The trolley tour gives you a good view of the overall area and I would recommend this to get your bearings.

<Content>Noisy but nice Got a great deal, $78 per night through hotwire. The room was nice, well appointed, but the revelers in the room next door were very loud, the walls were painfully thin, I could hear the TV in detail. When they checked out another group of noisies checked in. We could also hear the vacum cleaner outside our room in the hallway at 8 am.That said, though, the location is perfect, walking distance to 3 different T stations, Faneuil Hall, even walked to North End, took about 15 minutes. You need a room key to use the elevator, which made me feel safe in my room and in the hotel lobby late at night.

<Content>Not many complaints about this hotel . . . I just got back from a 2 day stay at Wyndham Boston. Magnificent Hotel - not ostentatious by any means, although I could not find the fitness/sauna/steam room. The concierge was very knowledgable, and referred us to an excellent pizza joint a block away. The mini-bar was well stocked, bathroom toiletries were excellent quality, bed was very comfortable. We had a beautiful view of the harbor. A few complaints are that room service was expensive, room temperature was balmy, front desk was a little snotty but that could be the culture in the city I'm still trying to decide. However, the location on Broad street does not allow for the taxi to park - you essentially have to cross road-raged Bostonians to get inside, but if you take Franklin street - it runs to Downtown Crossing and the Commons! The Hotel is maybe a little far from all the action, but that is a good and bad thing - depends on your preferences. Overall, I was very pleased with the experience and would come back again.

<Content>Ab - Fab!.... Well worth it!....The place to stay in Boston... This hotel and it's staff can be simply described as - FANTASTIC!. It is the best hotel we as a family have stayed in to date. It's location in guides may be a little missleading BUT I can assure you it's location makes it the ideal spot for shopping and sightseeing. Easy access to public transport network and particularily the Subway.Although this was booked as part of a package via Virgin/Trailfinders- it is well worth registering with 'Wyhndam By Request' via thier website. This allows you to taylor the room to your personal requirements. Stock the mini-bar with all your favourites. Free internert access for your laptop  free telephone calls within the US. You will also have FREE snacks and welcome drinks, free newpapers and the personal attention of a 'By Request' Manager within the hotel who will look after your EVERY need! Rooms are superb and you will be automatically upgraded at no extra cost if a room exists on arrival!Rooms are superb- clean and very tastefully decorated. We are due back in the US in June 2005 and will be using this Hotel Group during our touring holiday!

<Content>Fantastic all round (shame about the bathroom) Just echoing the other reviews with a few tips. Make sure you join the free 'wyndham by request' club if you book direct as we were treated to complimentary wine and nibbles and upgraded to a lovely suite. The only strange thing was that despite the huge living room and seperate bedroom the bathroom was very small. That's nitpicking though and all in all this was a perfect choice - highly recommended

<Content>Excellent hotel in convenient location. Have just returned from a 5 day December holiday in Boston with my sister - seeing the sights and visting my niece who is working there for a year. What a terrific city! Our enjoyment was enhanced by the choice of hotel, the Boston Wyndham. Location was perfect - Financial/Dowton District so quieter than some areas but very convenient for Quincy Market and Fanueil Hall and T stops to rest of Boston. The T was only 2 blocks away (2-3 minute walk) and even without the T it is easy to walk to a host of attractions - we are English so enjoy fresh air and exercise anyway! Plenty of restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity.Would definitely recommend the Wyndham as a beautiful hotel, large well appointed guest rooms, friendly, helpful staff - particularly the Conceirge and Reception staff. We were first of all shown to a room which faced a construction site across the road. We were concerned about the construction noise so asked to be moved which was done immediately. Only minor criticism relates to breakfast - a well stocked buffet is available but I would recommend ordering off the menu for freshly cooked hot food. Or even better, go to Pete's Deli next door for a bagle or toasted sandwich and coffee (half the price and just as good especially if you don't feel like a large meal).Hotel bar is also a pleasant venue to relax in after a hard day on the tourist trail for a nightcap or light bar snack. Pizza and martini cocktails are particularly good.Booked Wyndham and flight with Trailfinders and got an excellent deal.

<Content>Definitely Recommend We would definitely recommend this hotel. We have just returned from a four night stay, everything about this hotel was great, the service, the room, the food. It is a great location, short walk from Quincy Market and Fanueil Hall. The Staff were great and the concierge Rob bailed us out of a tight spot which would have ruined our day so thanks Rob. All in all a fab hotel in a fab city (first visit for two of us) would definitely go back to both!!

<Content>excellent hotel We stayed at the Wyndham for our last night in boston having spent a week in new england.The hotel is in an excellent location for the city centre with some lovely irish bars and restaurants nearby.The service/staff were very good and the room was very comfortable - no faults whatsoever.Would have stayed in this hotel longer had the price been lower, we paid $200+ for 1 night, probably because it was peak fall season and the world series was in town.All in all, highly recommended.

<Content>Fantastic! Had a wonderful experience at this hotel, all the previous reviews are right in giving this hotel a 5 rating.I signed-up as a ByRequest Wyndham member, it's free and intittles you to a room upgrade, and some complimentary gifts. We booked a Saturday night for $99 using the Entertainment Book.I informed the hotel that it was our anniversay, and when we arrived at our room after dinner, there was a bottle of Champagne on ice, chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate chip cookies, and a hand written note from the managers/staff hoping we are enjoying our stay.This hotel is a 5min. walk to Fanuil Hall, and 10min. to The North End, or Downtown crossing.It's in a very safe neighborhood.If there are any negatives, it's the lack of a pool, lack of parking,and unless you get free coupons for the breakfast buffet, it's not worth paying $16 pp.Every employee at the hotel, from Check-in - Conceirge - Housekeeping was friendly, helpful, and polite.Enjoy!

<Content>great hotel we were there during the blackout 2003 We had a lovely suite with a great location to all the tourist areas. We had already checked out the day the blackout occurred and were scheduled to take a night train home. Unfortunately the trains are electric and couldn't get into New York! The staff at the Wyndham were great. They checked us back in and gave us a room with a view, helped us find out about Amtrak, etc. As it turned out the next AM there were still no trains South (and by now a lot of people had been flying into Logan because NYC was closed) but we did find out trains were running out of Manhattan South (we needed to get the Wilmington, Delaware). It was like the Amazing Race! Everyone trying to get out of town. We ended up taking a Greyhound to NYC and were able to get a train home. It cost us about an additional $1000 but it could have been worse. Only down side was the staff didn't know much about the package deal I booked which was supposed to include nightly popcorn and sodas for the kids. ALso I was charged $14.00 for a 2 min phone call home (I stupidly left my calling card at home). I would recommend this Hotel to anyone!

<Content>Very Good We stayed with a fouteen month tot at the Wyndhams for 3 nights in August 04 and found it to be a great expereince. Provided with a corner room on the seventh floor (the start of the glass upwards extension) we had a great deal of space to position the cot and generally spread out and enjoy ourselves. The position of the hotel concerned us before arrival, however, we were much closer to the centre of town than expected. The area was very peaceful over the weekend (the lack of very local eateries was a drawback as the financial district did close on a Saturday and Sunday) yet it was close enough to Fanueil Hall, The Freedom Trail and Aquarium. Staff lovely. We'd go back!

<Content>Loved it ! Stayed at the Wyndham Boston for 6 days during the Democratic convention. Even with all that craziness, our experience was fantastic. I travel for work and this hotel was every bit as nice as any 5 star. Got a huge corner room with windows on both sides, big bathroom. Wyndham club service has special treats in the room all the time and would call to make sure we had everything we needed. Great, great hotel. Great location and great staff. They all kept the service up and their good humor through the entire week and their hotel was mobbed every day and night.

<Content>Didn't need to worry I booked three nights at the Wyndham Hotel in Boston and was concerned to read about the noise of the construction work nearby plus surrounding nightlife noise. We didn't have any problems, our room was at the back of the hotel and was as quiet as you would expect any city hotel to be(the main noise was from the external air conditioning vents). It was clean, comfortable and near to Long Wharf where we arrived by boat from the airport. It was an easy walk to Quincey's Market and to the 'T'. It was away from all the noise and hustle of the main shopping and thoroughfares, which we liked. So if you just want somewhere reasonably priced to stay and like moderate walks to key sites..I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fancy treat We lucked out into a reservation at the Wyndham Boston using Priceline ($100) and looking for a 4-star hotel in the downtown area. The hotel does not look like too much from the outside. It is an old respectable building with an unassuming lobby. But what it lacks in the more than compensates with an excellent, friendly staff and rooms that are fitting of the hotel's rating. Super clean, elegant and well equipped.We stayed at some Wyndham locations that were very run down and disappointing (Mt. Laurel, NJ and Montreal, Quebec) but this hotel is top notch.

<Content>nice. Stayed in a standard double room and found it rather small but very pleasant. Clean and plush, but rather dark and dim. The bathroom was spacious (and well lit) and much nicer than the average hotel. Our room had a view of a wall, but we were there only at nighttime so it didn't matter too much. The business center was cramped but sufficient. Late that night we ordered a couple of martinis at the bar downstairs and were surprised to find that our bill was $22 for two simple drinks-- but I suppose that's what you get at a hotel bar. A very nice hotel, would stay again.

<Content>Enjoyable Time We stayed at the Wyndham for 6 nights, and really enjoyed ourselves. The bed was so comfortable, room was quite plush with fantastic toiletries in the bathroom. True the view from our room wasn't great and the room itself was rather dark, but you couldn't possibly knock the location! Right by Quincey Market, the Waterfront and North End. We found the staff all very helpful. We got a fantastic deal with Trailfinders - 6 nights for the price of 4, so we were extremely pleased with the standard of the hotel!We had signed up with the by request programme but since we had booked thro an agent the benefits didn't apply. Another difference was that our paperwork stated that the water in the rooms was complimentary, but we have since been charged for them.

<Content>Fine, but nothing special. The hotel is fine. It has a good location. However, the two rooms we had were both very dark and both looked directly on a brick wall. The room was ok, but there was no view and the hotel was unwilling to switch us to a room not looking a brick wall. We had a low rate, so for one night it was fine. But, I would not stay here again unless it was the only option. There are too many other hotels in the city that aren't quity so dreary.

<Content>Average experience My family (myself, husband and 13-year old son) stayed at this hotel from Saturday, 8/14 to Monday, 8/16. We purposely went to Boston to attend a Red Sox game on Sunday afternoon. Since we had been to Boston in May of this year, we wanted to stay somewhere different to get a varied experience. After many hours searching this site and a few others, I choose this hotel mostly based on the reviews, cost and location. After booking the hotel through their website, I did find it cheaper on Expedia only a few hours later. I filled out their request form and within 2 days heard back from them that they would honor the lower price on Expedia and I would get the first night for free. All of this worked out fine and we had no problems. We opted not to rent a car since it's impossible to drive around Boston when you're not familiar, especially with the Big Dig going on. We hopped in a taxi from the airport ($30.00) and arrived at the hotel before 2:00 p.m. I wasn't sure that our room would be ready, but it was. Not only was the room ready, but because I am a WyndamByRequest member, we were upgraded ever before I asked for an upgrade.Sure, the welcome snacks weren't in the room when we arrived simply because we were there early and the room was upgraded, but they arrived right on time at 3:00 p.m. We were given a one bedroom suite so our son was able to sleep on the sofa bed and we used the large bedroom. Everything was clean.The noise from the construction across the street is not the hotel's fault. We were on the top floor (15th) and it was loud. Early in the morning, too. The hotel gives you a note in the room apologizing for the noise that will start at 7:00 a.m. and end at 3:00 p.m. From my experience, they started around 6:00 a.m. and ended around 5:00 p.m. Long day for those workers. Again, it's not the hotel's fault so I can't justify a complaint about it. Besides, we are early risers and weren't planning on staying in the hotel all day anyway.We did eat in the hotel restaurant one night. It was just OK. Not great. My husband didn't like his entree at all. My son and I had pizza. Not too bad. The waiter was wonderful and the place wasn't crowded at all. We wonder how they stay in business. It was a Saturday night and we were 3 of about 10 people in the entire restaurant.My major problem with this hotel is their location and no pool. Some people may think I'm being over-critical, but sometimes a pool is important. We were in town during the end of Hurricane Charlie and the weather wasn't good at all. A pool in the hotel would have killed a few hours for us between outings and, in this case, we really missed not having one. Also, the location wasn't great and maybe I'm being too critical again. We stayed directly across from Quincy Market during our last stay and that was great. Right in the middle of it all! This hotel is a few blocks from Quincy Market and a few blocks from the Aquarium and a few blocks from the T, etc. It's really a few blocks from almost everything. I like being closer to the sites.All in all, this hotel was average in my opinion. We travel to many different cities in the U.S. and I'm always looking for larger hotels (name brand), amentities, location and price. While this hotel really didn't do anything wrong, it wasn't one of my favorites.

<Content>not what I had expected Just returned from a one night stay at the Wyndham Boston and was not impressed. We had booked the Lion King Package well over 10 months ago. As there were to be three of us I opted for a suite for an additional $75.00 bringing the total for three adults to a very expensive $673.00. This included a breakfast buffet.I have been a Wyndham by Request member for a fews years. I got not one thing I requested. First off no early check in and they were quite adamant that the room would not be ready until three o'clock period. Check in at three was very busy and the staff was not overly friendly. Proceeded to our suite which was not what we expected. There was a medium sized bedroom (king bed) and a small living space with table,four chairs, sofa (w/bed) and tv cabinet. There was a small kitchen area with a coffee maker, 2 tea bags, 1 decaf coffee, 1 reg coffee, 2 cremoras and one stirrer 2 coffee cups. Remind you there are three adults. We wondered why they even put a dining table in the room as there were no microwave, utensils, nothing. We had bought some treats from the wonderful Mike's Bakery in the North end and had to eat with our fingers. The ice machine was broken on our floor, however it was repaired in a few hours. We called downstairs for extra towels, cups, glasses and possible utensils, got the first three but no utensils. We then inquired about our complimentary beverage and snack and were told that we would receive it at 6pm. we left for the play @7:15 still nothing and nothing waiting for us on our return at 11pm. Readied ourselves for bed, holes in the pillow cases, dingy looking. Up at the crack of dawn when construction noise woke us . We were on the fifteenth floor and could still hear it. This of course is not the hotel's fault.Off to breakfast..very good buffet. Explained to hostess that our breakfast was included she nodded and we ate and upon leaving we were chased down by a waiter demanding payment. I had to go to the front desk forvouchers we never received. At the front desk was told we did not have breakfast included but free admission to the aquarium. After a while they said we did have free breakfast but for 2 adults 1 child. This took more time as I explained I had paid $149.00 extra for the third adult and another $75 for the suite and I better get breakfast paid. To get through all this I went through 3 people as these folks don't know how to multi-task (I can't do that..you'll have to see....). The Lion King was wonderful and the seats we had were great, the view from our room overlooked the harbor but the price was just to inflated for what was received. We have stayed in many Boston hotels and we will not be staying at this one again. ANd if you are looking for Lion King packages the Omni Parker House has a better deal.

<Content>Wyndam - Qunicy Market Family Visit Just recently returned from three days in Boston. I grew up just South of Boston and returned for my Aunts 90th birthday. My family, my brothers, my sister, step Dad and Aunt all stayed at the Wyndam Hotel. The rooms were very clean and the service was excellent. All staff was friendly and attentive. A really great hotel experience - but not cheap. Worth it in my book. We visited on foot, Qunicy Market, New England Aquarium, took a cruise in Boston Harbor and enjoyed dinner in the North End Italian Village. Our group totaled 15 with my daughter 2 the youngest and my Aunt 90 the oldest. We walked everywere, felt very very safe and found the city to be exeptionally clean for being almost 400 years old. The theater district, back bay and the North End are vibrant with activity at 7 in the morning when I went for coffee or at 10 o'clock at night. This is a real treat for you to experience that urban atmosphere. A world of difference from suburbia!!! The hotel location was great I also noticed the Franklin Langham looked realy nice with an equally good location. Good luck, Enjoy and get some italian food in the North End!!! It's like visiting the set of the Sopranos.

<Content>Enjoyed the Wyndham The Wyndham lived up to our expectations! We stayed at the hotel three night in mid-July. Boston seems to be a town with a lot of nightlife and the Wyndham Boston sits on quiet Broad Street, sheltering you from all the noise. There was construction, but it is all over Boston. We walked literally everywhere - to Hanover Street restaurants in Little Italy, to all the Freedom Trail sites, to the Aquarium (great to visit!) - we only used the subway for locations way out. There was also a little 24 hour grocery within walking distance.The hotel had several elevators and they were very quick! We did not have a car (waited until we were leaving Boston to rent one!), so we did not use the parking. The staff was very friendly and helpful in giving us restaurant and site seeing ideas. We were traveling with two adults and two teenagers who all stayed in the same room. The room was very large and very beautifully decorated, I just wish they would use some of that room to have queen size beds instead of doubles. That would have to be our only negative on this great hotel!

<Content>Amazing After making reservations for the weekend before the DNC, I realized that the least I would be paying per night for a nice hotel in Boston was $200. However, after reading the reviews about the Wyndham, I figured I would see what I could do to stay there - I am so glad I did. I ended up paying only $130 per night - amazing!! Not only the price was great, but the staff, room and location was perfect. Lesson learned: you don't have to stay at the famous hotels, in fact most have poor service anymore. The next time I am in Boston - I will only consider the Wyndham.

<Content>Truly one of the best hotels Boston has to offer My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Wyndham Boston during our most recent visit to the Boston area, July 22-25, 2004. The staff more than exceeded my expectations, they had the 3p's that I look for when traveling:prompt, polite and positive. The accomodations were extremely spacious and impeccable, truly a delightful experience.

<Content>Great Hotel!! I had an awesome stay at the Wyndham Boston! The hotel location is perfect, walking distance to pretty much everything! We booked the family package at a great rate of $199, which included a two-room suite, breakfast buffet for four, aquarium tickets, free in-room movie or playstation time with delivery of popcorn and soda, and late (3:00PM) checkout. We checked in early and our room was already ready. All staff were very friendly! Our suite was very nice! You can tell they recently renovated. Bathroom was also very nice and was a good size. I like the way they set it up- the shower and toilet are in one room, while the sink is seperate. The beds were very comfortable as well! We were on the fourth floor, and there was barely any street noise. Breakfast buffet in their nice restaurant was delicious! The only real downside to this hotel is that they don't have a pool. But with everything to see and do in Boston, there's really no need for one. I definitely recommend this hotel to everone, and I WILL return the next time I visit Boston!

<Content>Nice Hotel but noisy We just came back from a visit to Boston and a stay at the Wyndham Boston. The hotel is nice--we had a nice room with a King size bed on an upper floor. Like many hotels, the bathroom could be layed out better with a little more room. We must agree with some of the previous posts regarding the outside noise. They leave a note in each room apologizing for the jackhammers that wake you up very early 6 days a week and can be heard loud and clear from the upper floors. Also, be aware--there are clubs on seemingly all sides of the hotel. If you are a sound sleeper, most likely you will sleep through the noise. The club on our side of the hotel got very noisy between 1 a.m and 2 a.m every night. We ate breakfast in the hotel every morning--it wasn't cheap--$13.50 per person for the very limited buffet and on Saturday when more people dine there, the staff is overworked and overwhelmed. There are no soda machines anywhere in the hotel--this is by design, I'm sure--so that you have to get one from the overpriced mini-bar. As others mentioned, Quincy Market is a short walk away, so buy your sodas or coffees there. Otherwise, the room was kept clean--maid service was generally excellent but one day the maid didn't leave any bottled water or a bath mat. Plus when people order room service, the trays tend to stay out in the hallway for several hours! We're Wyndham by Requests members--the welcome food packet is stingy here--just crackers and rondelet. We were at another Wyndham where we were given much more--but still it was nice to have free long distance calls. Overall, we would stay there again--it's hard to find a place in downtown Boston that isn't noisy. Too bad--there was once was a time when they rolled up the streets there at 6 p.m.! But perhaps, with the jackhammers nearby, for now, the Wyndham Boston is somewhat noisier . . .

The breakfast was delicious and included in our price. We received AAA discount. Close to many Boston attractions. We would revisit this hotel again!

<Content>Wonderful location Based on reviews we read on TripAdvisor, my husband and I spent 3 nights over Memorial Day weekend at the Wyndham in Boston and would definitely return. The location is really ideal, as it is 2-3 blocks from the Quincy Market and Faneuil Hall, where there are tons of restaurants, shops, entertainment. Also, the Aquarium train station (T) is about 3 blocks away, an easy walk if you fly in with just a carry-on. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was quite large. In fact, the TV seemed a long way from the bed.We recommend booking a show at the Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall. Have lunch or dinner at the North 5 Square restaurant in the North End, the Italian District just a few blocks away--the best tortellini we've had since eating it in Rome!Be advised that on Sundays and holidays, the T runs on a less frequent schedule, so if you plan to use it to get back to the airport, allow enough time. We waited 45 minutes on Memorial Day morning.

<Content>Great Place Had a one night stay in July of 2003 and what a suprise we had. We had a corner room with a view of the city and water. At night the view was out of this world and could't keep the window treatments closed. The room was very large for myself, my wife and the kids and the room extras (Large desk, movies ,robes, free cookies, soda, and water was great) Note: sign up as a Wyndham member before you book to get the upgrade and free stuff. Staff was great anf the walk to the historic area was very close and no problem at all. All in all we will be back soon for more than one night.

<Content>Absolutely Perfect My friend and I spent four wonderful days at the Wyndham Boston and have nothing but the highest praise for the hotel and the staff. The room was lovely and quite large. The staff were helpful with directions and kept our bags for us after checkout so we could spend the morning in the North End wandering around and enjoying ourselves without having to drag luggage with us. Having Wyndham By Request was an added bonus. We will be back just as soon as we can. Thank you so much!

<Content>Lived up to every good review! My fiance and I recently spent three nights at the Wyndham Boston. The hotel lived up to every good review I read before booking the trip. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed that I ever slept in. The bathroom was very nice, marble counter tops and very clean. Our view wasn't the best, our window looked across the to the other rooms of the hotel, there are some rooms that look onto the harbor. The entire staff was very courteous and helpful. The concierge was invaluable. The three different people working at the concierge desk were all very knowledgeable and gave us several good recommendations for restaurants. The only downfall to this hotel is that parking is $32/day, a little on the expensive side. If you fly into Boston this is a very good hotel and worth the price of the rooms, which were nicely priced after our AAA discount.

The food at the restaraunt was very good. The concierge was very accomodating and went out of his way to make sure that our needs were met. We have stayed in Wyndham Hotels in other cities, but none can top this one. We will certainly return!

<Content>Noisey Hotel, Neighborhood and Poor Service We found out late at night that the clubs empty out and there is so much noise we couldnt sleep. The front desk said that they couldnt do anything about it and said it happens on the weekends. We asked to move our room and they said no and it didnt matter as it was all around us. No bellman to help us move and no doorman to help get a taxi to airport. We wont be staying at Wyndham when we come back to Boston.

<Content>Great location/Great place to stay Did much online research for a place to stay in Boston for two nights midweek. Would have loved to stay at XV Beacon or Nine Zero. Got a little scared, though, when I saw the prices at XV Beacon and how small people said the rooms were at Nine Zero. The Wyndham worked out just great though. I was able to narrow down a rate on Hotwire of $88.00 per night!! This was after finding the next lowest rate of $137 on Wyndham. I did join Wyndham by Request and asked to have the number applied to my Hotwire reservation. I received a lovely e-mail from the Wyhdham by Request manager telling me this would be no problem. And how much she looked forward to meeting us when we checked in. When we checked in, we didn't seem to have the personal touch that we expected of the front desk staff or food/drink in the room. There was a well stocked mini bar. And when we had a few items from there, the charges did not show up on the bill. So I guess I'm not sure how the program is supposed to work. I thought we'd have things specifically laid out for us. Or that we would have had a note or comment from the front desk. The bartender, Scott, is fabulous. Didn't have a chance to eat in the restaurant. The parking is expensive at $32.00 per night. But we just parked at check-in and walked the town. There is unlimited in and out of the garage, though, when you valet, if you do decide to use your car. Boston is a walking town, though. And the T service is great for getting around. All in all, a great place to stay. Would definitely stay again and recommend it. I want to amend my review posted on February 9. My rating of the Wyndham Boston has improved!! I sent an e-mail to Wyndham ByRequest in response to their survey about our stay. I mentioned that I was confused by what I felt to be inconsistency with the ByRequest program. It turns out that hotels booked on Hotwire do not qualify for ByRequest amentities. I did receive credit for the stay to my account. But the special price I got on Hotwire meant that the ByRequest benefits did not apply. Once again, I received a very nice e-mail from the ByRequest manager explaining this. I will definitely look to the Wyndham for my first choice of lodging on any future trips!!

<Content>Good Hotwire deal but service a bit lacking We booked this hotel through Hotwire and got a great deal. The room was nice and the location is great (2 blocks from Quincy Market and Long Wharf). Check-in was smmoth and the agent that checked us in was friendly and helpful.On the down side, the walls in our room seemed to be a bit thin. We heard a lot of noise from the next room on two nights. Although we were on a non-smoking floor, the people next door smoked and the smell was just as if they were in our room. The front desk/security were not very helpful on this - suggeting that they might be able to move us the following night but not that night.

<Content>Not as Great as Hoped!! We visited the Wyndham Boston while in town for the Colts game on January 17, 2004. I had booked this through a corporate travel agency. I checked out the Wyndham website to look at pictures. I found out by reading the first page of the website that they building was a skyscraper, downtown Boston, overlooked the harbor and city. There was also a picture of the rooms. They looked very nice and large, plenty of room. Upon entering the hotel we were greeted by some great guys, who helped us into the room with all of our luggage. We mentioned how small the room was and he said to call the front desk, explain that it is a lot smaller than we thought and they could help us out with another room a little larger.First of all he building was not a skyscraper and was only 15 - 17 stories high. We looked out the window and all we could see was another building and a corner of the water. We called and received no help so I decided to go down in person. I started speaking with someone and she told me the only thing she could do was put me in another room, a suite, for $75.00 additional. No one can afford an extra $75. The fire alarm went off and she disappeared. I waited for approx. 15 minutes until my husband came and got me and she never came back. We gave up. We had to pay an additional $32.00 just to park out car overnight. I just feel their website is very deceiving and their front desk could be a lot more helpful.The bar was great and everything inside looked nice. The only people that helped us were the luggage guys and the bartender.

<Content>New Year's eve and day at the Wyndham I really have nothing bad to say about our two night stay at the hotel. The nonsmoking room with a king size bed, high ceilings, and an adequately equipped bathroom was the standard. Quincy Market and especially, the all important T were easily accessible from the hotel (5-10min walk). I suppose for the price it was a comfortable place to stay. All the staff were courteous and made us feel welcome. The concierge on duty was in particular very helpful. Oh, and leave your car in the garage during your entire stay....you don't want to navigate the poorly planned and paved streets of bean town. Watch out for the big dig.

<Content>Don't book into Wyndham If you happen to get this hotel when booking through Priceline, Hotwire, or any other internet booking service you are virtually S O L. Wyndham WILL NOT honor Wyndham By Request membership in any shape or form and the Wyndham employees are very curt when inquiring about the issue. WYNDHAM CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS GONE SOUTH! I personally will never stay at another Wyndham hotel because of the short sighted policies put into place November 1st with the WBR program.I booked a much better room at a hotel that appreciates a valued customer. Kudos to the Nine Zero  Hotel Marlowe in Cambridge! Two hotels that earned my business. I don't even care that the other room went to waste that was booked on Pricline.

<Content>The Warmth of the Wyndham The Wyndham did Wow us. What a great place to stay. I cannot wait to return. We had only a few days in Boston but this hotel and their staff could not have been more accommodating. Martine, John, Mary and my pal Edan were so much fun and professional. They were very willing to help with all of our questions and offering suggestions on places to see. The room was beautiful and clean. My friend liked the bed better than her own. This hotel may be located on a quiet street but after viewing the Marriot Long Wharf-I know our choice was the right one for us. Thanks to the entire staff for making our trip on the 7th and 8th of November so much more enjoyable than expected. We can't wait for our return visit. We recommend this hotel for anyone coming to Boston.

<Content>Not as impressed as everyone else..... I wish we had the same experience as the other reviews did. My husband and I went away to celebrate our 5th anniversary last weekend and we weren't impressed. The person who checked us in (I think his name was John) seemed more interested in having conversation with the guy next to him, it took almost 35 minutes for our luggage to come up and when we mentioned these things to the staff they didn't seem to care much. The hotel was just o.k. It is listed as a 4 diamond hotel but after my experience was comparable a two or three star hotel. The staff was o.k. but didn't go out of there way to make our stay special like we really wanted. Rocco in the bar was delightful, I wish the others were trained by him. We unfortunately won't be returning to this hotel with the exception to maybe stopping by for a drink with Rocco.

<Content>Terrific Hotel, tips on parking First I want to ditto the other rave reviews. Huge, clean rooms with luxurious beds. The restaurant was top notch too. Location perfect. If you stay here on a weekend park at 75 State St parking garage. The entrance is actually on Broad St., same as the hotel, at the end near Fanuil Hall. You will save a fortune compared to valet, as weekend rates are minimal (I think it was just $9 a day!) and it is only a block from the hotel.

<Content>This is a great hotel! This hotel was wonderful. We took the advice to join the Wyndham by Request club (no charge) and we had a bottle of wine, crackers and cheese in the room when we arrived. The bed was so comfortable, I thought I was home. This hotel is also located very close to Quincy Market, etc. It was very convenient. The valet parking was great too.

<Content>Boring - no personality Stayed at the Wyndham for 2 nights when in Boston on business last month. There was nothing 'wrong' other than it was very boring. And in a city full of cool hotels, I can say that I won't stay there again, unless I have to. Also, there was nothing going on at night in that area.

<Content>Downtown luxury... My fiance and I stayed at the Wyndahm for 3 days! The rooms were incredible! The staff there is nothing short of incredible. I must say that because they were packed for the holiday weekend, but still took the time to handle each patron with whatever they needed!

<Content>Great location Great Location. We walked to the childrens museam, the aquarium, fanuel hall, the public Gardens and the North end with two children very easily. The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly. We joined wyndham by request and got free local and long distance telephone calls, free high speed internet access, and a late checkout. Parking at 32.00 per night is ridiculous. You definately do not need a car so save yourself some money and leave it home.

<Content>Excellent!!! My wife and spent the night in this great hotel after previous trips to Boston when we stayed at the Marriott Long Wharf. We love the waterfront/aquarium Fanuel Hall area and were frustrated when the Long Wharf was sold out...we stayed at the Wyndham and were extremely happy we did. GREAT price and GREAT location! Walked all over Bsoton and more importantly were about 4 minutes from the sites we love near the Marriott Long Wharf (ie IMAX, Aquarium). The room was great and staff very helpful- I HIGHLY recommend this hotel...one word to the wise though I had some problems with the valet parking- expensive and slooooww...and the fact that my car came back with the fron hood open and subsquent engine problems leads me to believe someone messed around- better off taxing to the hotel if possible because with this location you walk everywhere anyway!

<Content>You Won't Be Disappointed I booked my reservation on Expedia with a flight and got a great price on a luxurious suite. We were in town for business and everybody else stayed near Copley Square in a different hotel.I will never regret my decision to stay at the Wyndham Boston. The hotel is very well maintained and clean. Our room was very big with a separate bedroom and living room.The Freedom Trail and Quincy Market are a couple of blocks from the hotel. We were able to pretty much walk or take the subway anywhere we wanted to go.I checked out the hotel that the other people in our group stayed at, and we had a much nicer place to stay and it was less expensive.I have read other reviews that complain about the location of this hotel. If you don't mind staying in a hotel that isn't right next to a mall, you will do fine here. Many shops, attractions, and restaurants are within walking distance.As other reviewers have pointed out, make sure to enroll in Wyndham ByRequest on their website. They esentially customize your room, and make sure that there is a beverage and snack of your choice in your room when you arrive. Each day they provided us with two bottles of water. I know that doesn't seem like a big deal, but most hotels are charging $5 for a bottle of water. You also are guaranteed the best available room when you arrive, late check-out if you need it, and free long distance and local calls.Parking is $32 a night at the hotel. We did fine without a car.The staff was very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Wyndham ok buuuuuuuuuut.... We stayed at the Wyndham Tremont in Boston in July. My granddaughter, who is 11, couldn't get over all the colors and patterns in the room. It was very busy. Enjoyed our orange juice, cheese and crakers (nice touch). The bell hop(s) not at all helpful in three instances. Bed comfortable and clean and the view from room was great. I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Hotel Service here was wonderful and the location was great. Within walking distance to so much of what Boston has to offer. I highly recommend joining Wyndham by Request via their website. We had a family fun package via their website and were upgraded to a king suite that was absolutely beautiful. I would stay here again in an instant.

<Content>Did the Right Thing What started out to be a nightmare ended with satisfaction. I made reservations at the Wyndham specifying a king, non-smoking room with a view. When we arrived (midnight due to cancelled inbound flights) we were given a double-bed smoking room with a stale cigarette stench that bowled you over when you opened the door. After complaining and being told it's the last room we proceeded to search the town (yes, at midnight) for another hotel. Unsuccessful, we headed up to the Wyndham room at 2:00 a.m. only to find the bathroom floor flooded. Management was quick to fix the problem and we were in bed by 3:00 a.m. After this disappointing start to our vacation, I complained to the front desk the next morning and without question was upgraded to a king non-smoking suite on the top floor with a great view of Boston harbor. While initially disatisfied, the hotel did the right thing in the end. It's a nice hotel with a professional staff and a great central location. I would stay there again.

<Content>Great Deal! I recently bought two night at a Hotel in Boston on Hotwire.com. After the purchase they tell you the hotel. I paid $90 a night at the Wyndahm Boston! The rooms were great and the location was perfect. My parents and sister were visiting from MN and they thought the hotel was extrordiary! Feather pillows and comforters, great staff and excellent concierge! Recommend this to anyone.

<Content>Great service " by request" Couldn't praise service of Wyndham by Request manager enough. I had a need to aquire stair access as I don't like lifts and was e-mailed personally on more than one occasion and asssured that this would not be a problem. The hotel is beautiful, central and the service is special. Thanks for making an apprehensive stay wonderful!!

<Content>Excellent hotel, superb staff. I spent 11 nights in the Wyndham Boston, and found it to be an excellent hotel. Staff were top-notch, and quality of service second to nothing.Only small gripes would be, no pool and tiny Gym. Tip-join their members club (free) via their website before you book, and then you truly get treated royally .i.e upgrade to suites, free calls, free welcome snacks, daily papers etc.
