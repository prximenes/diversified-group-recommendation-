<Content>Disappointed This is in a nice location but just has the basic needs. The reviews led me to believe this was an exceptional hotel. This is a good value and a good location. The rooms are not well appointed and the staff was not overly helpful. A good value yes. Top notch hotel it is not.

<Content>Best Stay You Can have in this Great City This is a great place to spend time with your loved one. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and if you rent a car they have a under ground garage. The hotel is located in the hub of Seattle's Queen Ann area with easy access to down town using the mono-rail system and the must visit Pike's Place market. Within easy walking distance of the Space Needle and some great eateries like Thai food located on Mercer and 1st Ave rated as one of the top fifty in the United States, and Peco's a short one block from the hotel. Order the Dungeness crab omelet and a 'El Diablo Mary at Peco's. Enjoy your stay, and by the way this is the first time I have taken the time to write a review.Frank and Debra Gallant

<Content>Just Right I booked because of the reviews on Tripadvisor and it was better than I expected. Great price (parking not included =$15 a night), great location (a short walk to Key Arena), clean and well managed. Some people might want a more central location, but we found the neighborhood perfect for a quiet stay. We will be back.

<Content>A Seattle Gem Whether you are a tourist or a local, this hotel is a great find. The location couldn't be better for exploring the Queen Anne neighborhood, attending an event at Seattle Center or Key Arena, or experiencing Seattle itself. The hotel itself is small and prices are very reasonable (book with the hotel directly, as they will meet or beat what's listed on hotels.com or other booking sites). We paid $109 per night for a king room on the top floor, which is very reasonable for downtown Seattle. The hotel also offers weekly and monthly rates for those needing extended stays. The hotel is decorated simply, is extremely clean, and very festive for the holidays. Parking is an extra $15/day (unlimited in and out privileges) in a secure underground garage. The rooms have a kitchenette with a microwave, 'fridge, and a sink. The beds are comfy, even if the decorating scheme is not very earth-shattering. The bathrooms are neat, clean and have a shower/tub combo and adequate counter/sink space. The hotel is on several major bus routes to both the top of Queen Anne and to the center of downtown. Plus, there are several grocery stores (Safeway and Metropolitan Market), pubs, restaurants, and shops in the immediate vicinity. The front desk personnel were always friendly and willing to provide information, bus schedules, etc. I would highly recommend this hotel for those new to Seattle or those who just want an inexpensive weekend break in the city.

<Content>Great Location, Helpful Staff, Good Price My wife  I loved the Mediterranean in Seattle. The location was wonderful. It is right on the bus line and within easy walking distance to the Seattle Center (Space Needle, monorail station). We also walked to Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square, but it was about a 40 minutes walk. The room was clean and roomy. The lobby was vary nice and the staff was friendly and helpful. A Starbucks is attached directly to the lobby. They even had Starbucks coffee in the room. I enthusiastically recommend the Mediterranean.

<Content>The Inn is Awesome We stayed at the Mediterranean Inn for three nights in October and were very pleased with this hotel. Beautiful views, excellent location, clean room - with a nicely equiped kitchenette - and a Starbucks in the lobby. Best buy in the Seattle area if you are looking for a comfortable place to stay and don't need a pool, restaurants, or conveniance store on location - it's all within a block of the place anyway. We did get a corner room - better views, but the stairway cut into the size of our room considerably. We still had plenty of room and with a view, but if it is more than two people or with kids it would be a tight fit. Able to walk to everything - Space Needle, mono-rail, water front, etc.

<Content>Good Location , clean and pleasant stay. We stayed here for 4 nights the first week of October.The room was very clean and a reasonable size. We especially liked the free internet usage in the lobby and found all the staff on the reception desk to be very friendly and helpful.The hotel is very handy for the Space Needle area and Monorail and has many bus stops just outside with frequent buses to many destinations.Also just a few minutes walk away there are plenty of restaurants and bars, especially T S McHugh's with a good selection of beers and meals.With Starbucks part of the hotel building, breakfast was made easy.

<Content>Nice stay and close to everything My husband and I stayed here for two nights. The room was nice and bigger than I expected. There is a Starbucks connected to the lobby which made it easy to grab a hot chocolate in the morning. There was a good sushi restaurant right across the street and a few other restaurants very close. We were able to walk to the Space Needle in 10 minutes or less and also walked to Pike Place and the Seattle Aquarium one day (long walk but definately feasible if you're up for it). We would stay here again and think the price is right- the only thing I missed was a hot tub!

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed at the Mediterranean Inn for a weekend in Seattle recently. We rented a car so the fact that it is not right downtown was fine with us. The location was quite good with a Safeway across the street, we bought several items and brought them back to the hotel. There is a fridge and microwave in the room so you can save money by not eating out all the time if you wish. There are several restaurants and a movie theatre within a block of the hotel. I loved the Starbucks right in the hotel! Parking is underground for $15 per day. We had a very nice stay.

<Content>Nice middle class hotel: Exceeded our expectations We were in the Mediterranean Inn for one night before getting a car rental to drive to San Francisco. We liked the hotel and were pleased with our choice. The location is quite good, it is reasonably close (max. 10 Minutes walk) to the Monorail station, which needs another 2 minutes to go to the city centre. A bus stop is on the same block.The rooms were very clean, modern, well-equipped and quite big. Computer terminals and a business centre are available. There was no breakfast, but a Starbucks in the same building and about 5 Restaurants within 100 meters. We can especially recommend Sam's Sushi.

<Content>Comfy place for a short stay We spent a day/night in Seattle. Ended up booking with this hotel because of price and location. About 10-15 minute walking distance to the Monorail. We also felt pretty safe walking back from the Monorail at around 8 or 9pm. It has a gated parking garage under the building, but you only get access after you check in. It is conveniently located across from a major grocery store (Safeway... I think). And we also found a Thai restaurant just down the street called Phuket that we absolutely loved!!The room itself was pretty standard, with no AC but a ceiling fan. During our stay in September, we left the window slightly open and was fine throughout the night. Overall we were pretty satisfied with our stay here.

<Content>Everything you want from a hotel... We picked this hotel based on the reviews on TripAdvisor, and it's proximity to the Space Needle. I have to confess that I normally would never book a 2 1/2* hotel, but I do trust Tripadvisor members' reviews, and I was not disappointed in the least. The service was 5*, and the room was clean and comfortable. I was particularly impressed by FREE bottled water, coffee and popcorn in the room. This hotel is a well kept secret, but I guess the secret is out now!

<Content>My family's favorite We have stayed at the Mediterranean Inn at least 5 or 6 times in the last few years and have never had a bad experience. The location is great, especially if you have kids, as it's close to the Seattle Centre (Science museum, children's museum, space needle) and you can take the monorail downtown and to Pike Place Market. The area is also great for walking around -- there are good restaurants, grocery stores, a used book store. The last time we stayed here (Aug 2008) I booked a king sized bed and found it very comfortable -- on previous trips we've had a queen bed that was a bit too small for us. Also, you can request a room with a window seat made into a bed if you're traveling with a small child (probably not good for those younger than 3 as it's fairly high off the ground). My 6 year old loves it. The one down-side is that the windows aren't the best and let a good deal of street noise in but I can't say that it's bothered us much.

<Content>Highly recommend it We stayed here for 3 nights and it was the perfect location to explore Seattle. We walked to all the main attractions, Space Needle, Experience Music Project, Pike Place Market etc. The location is also close to lots of smaller shops and eateries. The view from the roof terrace was fantastic, take your breakfast up there and enjoy! The room was spacious with great coffee.

<Content>nice time Nice hotel in Queen Anne close to Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP, Monorail, Key Arena). The rooms are clean and comfortable with kitchenettes. There is NO A/C - do not be surprised by this! We went in late July and were fine with the ceiling fan and window, but if you must have a/c, don't book here! There is a cool rooftop deck with good views of the city and the water. The staff was friendly and helpful at all times.I have to disagree with those who say the hotel is on a very busy street. I just didn't see that. It is a one-way main road, but we did not see a high volume of cars nor people in this area at all. I thought it was a nice area and there are several restaurants you can walk to.We had a lovely time here - I recommend it!

<Content>Great location, great hotel My college-student daughter and I stayed at the Mediterranean Inn for six days from late July to early August, 2008. The hotel has a great location, with a bus stop out front to take visitors to downtown Seattle (like the waterfront, Pike Place Market, etc), and other stops within walking distance. We actually walked to Pike Place and to the Victoria Clipper pier. We did a lot of sightseeing and didn't need a car. There are a dozen restaurants within a few blocks: Indian, Irish, Thai, Greek, Mexican, a Melting Pot (fondue), and of course, several coffee shops. Yes, there's a Starbucks in the lobby, but the Uptown Espresso in the next block has both coffee varieties and pastries that you won't find at home--and isn't that why you travel? There is a Safeway across the street, and an upscale Metropolitan Market two blocks away.The room was very clean and well maintained. As others have noted, there was a kitchenette, with a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, and sink. Free local calls, TV with a good selection of cable channels, iron and ironing board in the closet. Spacious bathroom with good shelves, which is always important when two women share a bathroom.Our room didn't have air conditioning, but even in August, Seattle was comfortable. We slept with the window open, and on our last night, we could hear someone snoring from a room nearby, but it was distant enough that it struck us as funny rather than annoying, The front counter staff was very helpful. They knew the prices of shuttles to the airport, and were also very accomodating about leaving our luggage in a secure room for an entire day after we checked out. The computers in the lobby were helpful for printing out flight confirmations, and the self-service laundry was reasonably priced at $1.50 to wash and dry a load. The view from the rooftop deck is postcard perfect, so if you have a clear evening, go up and watch Mount Rainier turn pink as the sun sets. On the whole, a wonderful location and a well-run hotel.

<Content>Geat stay at the Mediterrean The Mediterrean is located close to Seattle Center and the Space Needle. It is only rated a 2star. It must be because there is no AC or restaurant attached. However, there is an attached Starbucks and the coffee aroma is great, esp in the AM. There is a nice roof top garden...Starbucks and a view!! What could be better. This was a great moderately priced hotel, that deserves a better rating. Clean rooms, efficient staff, prompt elevators. Nice decor, charming lobby and exterior. Stay there if you can.

<Content>Bed Bugs! I stayed here due to the mostly very good reviews I found online. However after 2 nights here, I received over 10 bed bug bites, 2 on each of my hands, 4 on my back and 5 more on my arms! I can't believe I paid over $130 for this experience and it's taking over a week for the bites to go away. I called and complained and am hoping they have done something about it.

<Content>Enjoyed the stay I really liked this hotel. Room was very comfortable with a cool window seat with a bit of a view and convenient parking under the hotel with elevators for $15. It is located in great neighborhood, near Seattle Center and the Space Needle within an interesting walk to downtown and Pikes Market but with buses nearby. The great thing about the area is it has lots of local people and their restaurants, coffee shops and bars so you are not just stuck with tourists and traveling businessmen. Try The Crow, great neighborhood Bistro nice bar their signature dish is the chicken but the fish was great too (823 5th Ave N).

<Content>great location This hotel was part of a package I purchased through Expedia. Although the room and in particular the bed was one of the smallest that I have experience din the many trip sto the States, the hotel itself was in a great location.I was travelling on my own, but was wondering if indeed 2 people would have fitted into th bed in my room.The location was close to bars and food places and also a Safeway supermarket. The area was very nice indeed and the view from the roof top deack was excellent.

I appreciated the kitchenette with microwave, kettle and coffee-maker - as well as the free internet terminals in the lobby. The hotel has an on-site Starbucks, and has several restaurants and cafes nearby. It is only a few minutes walk away from the Space Needle and the monorail. I would defintely stay here again.

<Content>I like this hotel Stayed at the Med again as I did in December. Met with the same experience. Friendly staff and nice room. They do not have A/C in all rooms so if that is important, check to see if you can book one of those rooms in the summer. They have a Starbucks in the lobbly. The hotel is very convenient to Seattle Center and Key Arena and the Queen Anne area of Seattle. I hope to stay there again on my next trip.

<Content>Good location, clean, nice stay My husband and I stayed at the Mediterranean Inn in mid-May for 4 nights for an anniversary. We were very pleased with it. After reading all the reviews, we knew what to expect - nothing fancy, but clean, safe and in a great location. We were there during that heat wave, and temps were reaching the 80s, but we were out most of the day seeing the sights, so had no need to the A/C. Our room only had a ceiling fan, which was sufficient enough while we were sleeping. The only thing was when we slept with the windows open for some air circuation, we could hear our neighbors across the courtyard chatting. Nothing very loud at all and I just put in some ear plugs. Perhaps if we had gotten a room facing the other way, we would have been faced with street noise too.The front desk staff was helpful, one guy told us to get breakfast at the Mecca Cafe right down the street in Queen Anne - yum! We also liked how the business center offered free printing - great for planning out bus trips and printing out routes. We did plenting of busing and walking during our trip to Seattle. The hotel is conveniently located along major buslines going downtown and also lines to Ballard, Green lake, etc. Loved that it is walking distance to the Seattle center - we walked there every day.The bathroom looked like it had new fixtures and was very clean. I didn't mind that it was basic, cleanliness is the most important thing to me; no mold or anything to be found in the bathroom.We loved having the kitchennette w/ fridge and microwave and coffeepot. Nice to have Starbucks downstairs and Safeway across the street as well. Nice little hotel!

<Content>Great Hotel in Seattle We really liked this hotel. It was clean and the rooms were spacious, especially the bathroom. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had arrived at the hotel around 10:30am and wanted to just drop our luggage off and explore the rest of Seattle. But with a little luck, we were told our room would be available in half an hour. There are computers in the lobby with internet connection. Connecting to the lobby is a Starbucks, so getting coffee every morning was easy, although they do provide coffee and a coffee maker in your room, along with a sink, mini refrigerator and microwave. There is a Safeway right across the street, which made things very convenient to buy microwavable dinners and having an affordable meal. Getting to the downtown area was not difficult, as the Seattle Center is about two blocks away and if you take the monorail, it takes you into the downtown area. I would recommend anyone who wants an affordable trip to Seattle, to check out this hotel.

<Content>Not bad, very convenient We stayed here for one night. Nothing bad, and not too much that sets this hotel apart in a good way either. There is no A/C in the rooms, I guess people used to that will think it odd that I mention it (but I am from Texas, so we like our air cold). The staff was friendly and the property seemed to be well maintained and convenient to most things in the downtown Seattle area.

<Content>Good Place to stay My brother and I stayed here last year. He is going to Seattle again this year with his son. We enjoyed the stay here. Very nice place to stay. We loved the location, able to walk everywhere or take the bus. Nice walk to the market. The view on the roof top is excellent, the best! Nice to sit and relax and read or just look at the beautiful view. I do quite a bit of traveling and would recommend this place and would stay again.

<Content>Great resonably priced hotel in Seattle My husband and I stayed here during the first week of March. We needed to be in Seattle to handle some family matters, so this was an unexpected getaway.For the price, it was very clean, the kitchenette was a great amenity (fridge, sink, coffee maker), and close to attractions.We felt that the beds could use some updating. On both of the double beds, there was an indentation in the middle. So that made it a bit uncomfortable for sleeping. Otherwise, we would definitely stay here again on a return trip to Seattle.

<Content>The Med Inn is a decent stay in Seattle First of all, this hotel is NOT in downtown Seattle. It's in the Lower Queen Anne Hill section of the city. It's about two blocks from Seattle Center, featuring the iconic Space Needle, but also with many other museums and attractions plus the Key Arena. This makes the Mediterranean Inn ideally located for people looking for a relaxing stay in Seattle or families with children. Downtown is easily accessed by the city's wonderful public transportation system or, if you're able, a good healthy walk. The hotel itself is very reasonably priced, but we're talking no-frills here. Just a basic clean room. The staff was friendly and helpful. The neighborhood features many varied restaurants for every taste imaginable. From burgers to Indian to Thai, Lower Queen Anne has it all. And if you're still hungry, there's a Safeway supermarker across the street. Very handy. Other hotel features are a gym (small), TWO computers with internet in the common area, a laundry, and a Starbucks (imagine that) in the hotel. The bad news is the elevators are s l o w . And if you get a room facing the Space Needle, you might have to deal with some street noise at night.And the best view of Seattle is a short (but steep) walk away at Kerry Park. Try to get there around sunset for postcard quality views.

<Content>Basics with a great roof top view My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. It was your basic hotel room, nothing too fancy. Nice amenities such as the Starbucks adjacent to the lobby downstairs as well as a great roof top view. Views of the bay, downtown, and Queen Anne Hill. Good price for the location.

<Content>Best location and view ever - HORRIBLE Hotel the view to this hotel is AWSOME...if you get a room on the street. If you book the chea[est room, you will get a room with a view of a WALL. The view from the roof is nothing short of amazing as well. There are many fabulous restaurants nearby... This almost makes it worth staying at again, almost.The lobby is lovely, the staff is terrific... but the rooms are flea bags. Very - very dated! I met other guests (that were a bit sketchy) that live there on a semi permanent basis, which tells you a bit. They get their rooms for $50 a night thru some vocational school. The decor is horrible, the furniture and bed is very old and crotchity, the TV's are old, the bedding feels like maybe you should go buy a sleeping bag. Seriously, in short the rooms themselves are really terrible. The rooms are comparable to a run down Motels 6.What huge potential this hotel has... desperately needs remodeling. Desperately. If they painted and got new beds I would probably go back.

<Content>Great little place to stay This was a very central and easy-to-find gem in downtown Seattle. Some of the highlights include: clean, secure underground parking ($15 or so), complementary computers in the lobby for internet access, free wireless in the lobby, nice room, helpful and pleasant staff, 15 minute walk to shopping downtown. I would recommend this place; overall very positive experience.

<Content>Excellent value We really loved everything about this hotel. It was in a supreme location and the room was in excellent shape. It was large and clean and had a few amenities (vcr, fridge). We had a low floor room so we couldn't see the Space Needle but we ventured up to the roof to get a beautiful view of the whole city. The surrounding area is full of shops, restaurants and attractions. It is only a 5 minute walk to Seattle Center and the museums, Space Needle and Experience Music Project. And downtown is just a short drive away.

<Content>Great location, price, security, amenities. Perfect location, the place looks to have been recently remodeled. The staff was friendly, security quite ample (CCTV and keycard elevators). All rooms include fridge (with bottled water), microwave (with popcorn), coffeemaker (with coffee), and TV. Beds were okay, pillows could've been better. Dick's burgers and Safeway groceries directly across the street. Several other restaurants and bars within 2-3 blocks. We paid $95+tax for this room and it was so much better than the Homewood Suites on Western Ave.Also 2 blocks from Seattle Center, Spaceneedle, monorail, etc.

<Content>Better than Expected! OK, we thought it was going to be a crummy place. We were going skiing at Crystal Mountain and had a couple of days layover in Seattle. We found this place and the price was cheaper than most of the decent looking places in Seattle. My girlfriend had been to Seattle a bunch of times but I never had. She said this neighborhood was not the best but we took a chance anyhow.Well, first of all my girlfriend was WRONG. The neighborhood was great and lots of cool shops nearby and even though there was a Starbucks in the lobby there was much better coffee just down the street as well as a cool used CD shop and also great pizza you can buy by the slice.Anyhow, back to the hotel. The place looked to be pretty new. The desk clerk looked like a hipster doofus who really wasn't too helpful but we really didn't need much help. The room was great. I don't look for dirt but the place looked very clean to me. The shower had great water pressure and the bed was comfy. hey had a fitness center too although not that much equipment. The parking was a pain but I found that is the case all over Seattle.I would totally recommend this place, especially if you get a swinging deal like we did.

<Content>Good location, good view We stayed for two nights. The location is supreme. I don't think that we got enough bang for our buck. Everything was clean and we paid to get upgraded to the sixth floor. I don't see why we had to pay, we had already paid an extra $30 to be able to use their underground parking. I used the gym and it was helpful. There weren't that many machines, just the basics. There were bottles of water and fruit available which was helpful.

<Content>Great location, great hotel! We stayed here for 6 nights in Nov 07.First night was a bit rough, we had asked for a room with a view of the Space needle, which is exactly what we got. It was a nice room on the sixth (top) floor, room 632. However, the hotel has a bathroom extraction system that is always on, as opposed to having a system that has a fan on a timer in each individual room. Unfortunately the motor/unit for this entire system appears to be directly above this room, mounted on the roof. As a result we found it almost impossible to sleep!This issue was resolved the next day with a transfer to another room on the fifth floor on the other side of the hotel, sadly minus the view of the needle but they did give us a discount for the inconvienience, problem solved!The hotel is lovely, nice and clean, very helpful staff and we would certainly stay here again as well as recommend it to others!The real benefit of this hotel is the fantastic location!!! There are plenty of shops/supermarkets for any of your food/beer requirements (each room has its own little kitchenette/bar!) and tons of places to eat, drink, breakfast etc etc. The hotel is also directly next to the Seattle Centre (Key Arena, Space Needle, museum's, theatre etc) and also on a main bus route to get directly into downtown Seattle if you don't fancy the walk.Good choice of hotel!! Good choice of city to stay in, Seattle was a great, safe place to vacation in, lots to do!!

A short walk down the road to Peso's where we had scrummy food. Close to space needle  monorail. Love the viewing deck on the roof overlooking Seattle.

<Content>Great Location Great location, walking distance to local attractions like the Space Needle and Science Museum. The hotel is also a block away from a great Safeway's Supermarket and a number of food outlets. The room was clean, with a firm bed and one chair near a desk. This is great if you were single but as a couple, one of us had to enjoy a meal sitting on the bed. The microwave, fridge and coffee / tea maker were appreciated as no breakfast was available. Free coffee and tea sachets were provided. There were however no plates or bowls so eating-in was difficult.To travel downtown, take either the mono-rail or bus. The bus on First Ave was very convenient and cheap. We used the free bus service in town to see the various places of interets.Tip: Buy food and drinks at the Safeways supermarket and save yourself a packet. They had lovely hot dishes and salads and you were allowed to use their cafe section to eat your pre paid food, purchased in the supermarket.

<Content>Great value and location! Last winter, when a rare Seattle snow storm knocked out our power, I checked into this hotel with my teenage daughter. They only had one room left since many other locals were doing the same to keep warm. Despite the high demand, they did not gouge me. The room was small, but nice with a decent view of the Sound and the Space Needle. It's located in walking friendly lower Queen Anne with many good restaurants nearby and I cinema on the next block. Add the Starbucks on the ground floor and you can't ask for more for the money! Highly recommend if you don't need to be right downtown.

<Content>Great Place! Great Price! For the price, I doubt if you can find a better place in Seattle. We stayed at the Inn twice, bookending a cruise. At our first check in, they were able to give us our room at 10am! The 2nd time, at noon! Couldn't ask for better. The front desk staff was great. Even though we had booked thru hotels.com, we were given an air conditioned room (had read about the street noise) for both nights for no addtional charge (the hotel reservations lady could not have been nicer when we called to request a/c). Great location. Easy walk to Seattle Center (Space Needle, etc; catch the monorail down to near Pike Market). Beautiful views from roof deck. Close dining, movie theater, two grocery stores. I will definitely book at the Inn on our next trip to Seattle.

<Content>Reasonably priced hotel in nice district Searching for Seattle city centre hotels on Expedia proved a heart-sinking experience for their price, especially with exorbitant parking charges as well. Being a single traveller, expensive plush hotels rooms were an unnecessary luxury.The Mediterranean Inn promised to be a cheaper alternative still within easy reach of downtown. I was drawn to a promised great rooftop view. Following my internet driving instructions through the hustle and honking of the middle of town, it was nice to arrive in the quieter Queen Anne district. The distinctive yellow hotel is immediately obvious and I parked in the 'do not leave for more than 5 minutes' kerbside and dashed in to check in and get access to the parking garage - $15 a day parking charge. Perhaps, a dedicated area for cars to pull into would have been nice and alleviated my fear of getting a ticket while checking in.Access to the underground car park is by keycard. Be careful and go slow as you drive into the garage or you will scrape the bottom of your car. The fit for some of the parking spaces was quite snug and I was glad to be driving a compact car!The rooms were absolutely fine - clean, reasonable size, comfortable bed as well as a mini fridge and microwave. There was a ceiling fan to compensate for lack of AC - fine for my trip in Sep but some reporters have said it's too warm in the summer months. It was nice to have some complimentary bottles of water in the fridge as well as popcorn for the microwave! I had a view of the Space Needle from my window.The view from the roof was as great as promised, especially at dusk when the lights of city twinkle on. You can see the nearby Space Needle, the taller buildings of downtown as well as Puget Sound. There was also a Starbucks on the 1st floor and an exercise room. There were 2 free computers available for general use (no chairs) in the lobby as well as a business centre.There are a lot of great amenities within a few blocks of the hotel. The western edge of the Seattle Center complex is a block away, providing easy access to the Space Needle, Sci Fi museum, Experience Music project, Pacific Science Center and the monorail to downtown Seattle. There are several restaurants, a Safeway and a cinema within 2 blocks of the hotel. A walk up the hill along Queen Anne Ave brings you to another cluster of restaurants. Bus connections zip you downtown but it's only a 20-25 minute walk away.I found the Mediterranean Inn to prove a good base to explore Seattle city centre.

<Content>Great Value, Great Location, Great View Just got back from Seattle and we stayed here for 4 nights. I rate this place highly because it is cheap, clean, all of the rooms have kitchenettes and it is in a great location. My wife and I stayed here with our baby and this place was great for us. The room was big enough for a travel crib. (Room 411) It was quiet. And best of all there are two grocery stores very close to the hotel to buy food from and avoid overpriced, crowded restaurants. (no fun with a baby) The Metropolitan Store has tons of great food that is ready to eat. Safeway is kind of a dump. The hotel is also less than a block away from the bus stop that will take you right to Pike Market and Pioneer Square. Let's face it, this isn't the Four Seasons. If you want that you have to pay for it. If you want to extend your stay by spending less on hotels, food, parking your car, and getting around....stay here. ps: the roof top view is almost as good as the Space Needle.

<Content>All I can say is HUH? All I can say about the rave reviews here is HUH? We were in Seattle for a weekend event out by the airport. We stayed the first two nights at the airport Marriott which was excellent. But, for Sunday night, we decided we would try the Mediteranean so as to be downtown in the middle of everything. Considering the relative locations of the two and the fact that the Mediteranean was at least $40 (not including parking, isn't that nice of them) more a night we may as well have stayed at the Marriott. The room there was definitely a lot nicer as well as being a lot cheaper.The hotel itself definitely had a certain Hostel/Camp feel to it. The room is small and the bed is low and the tiny TV and stand alone VCR in the room were defintely the cherry on top. The staff is ok but largely ditzy and a little out of it. I kinda felt like I had wandered into a cool kids party back in high school. You know, where everyone is stoned and laughing at some in joke that you aren't a part of. The best thing to recommend this hotel is the location. It is right in the middle of everything and the neighborhood is very nice and has access to many of the great amenities. What would be really great is if they offered a bike rental serivice as that would get you anywhere in downtown.The hotel is ok, I would consider it to be a really basic, basic hotel with a good location. But extremely expensive for what you get. Overall it is clean and well maintained. But I just kept getting the feeling that I was paying a heck of a lot of money for a 2 star hotel.Do make sure you eat dinner at the Flying Fish just a few blocks away.

<Content>Excellent value for money, would definitely stay again! I booked the Mediteraranean Inn hoping for a clean, safe and friendly place to stay, which is exactly what I got. The rooms are large and well-equipped, even having microwaves and fridges, which is always useful. The free internet in the lobby was fab, as was the on-site Starbucks.As for location, as a young female travelling alone I felt very safe going out at night, and there are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. It's about a 20-minute walk into downtown Seattle but only 5-minutes from the Seattle Centre and Space Needle where there's a metro located for anyone not fancying the stroll.My only real complaint with the hotel was their refusal to accept my Maestro debit card - i didn't realise that in the US debit cards are accepted in very few places, and that a maestro card is virtually unheard of. Just in-case anyone out there is as oblivious as me...take a credit card or at the very least a visa debit with you before setting foot in the US!!

<Content>great place! I had a short stay in Seattle in May 2007, and was originally slated to stay at a highly rated B/B, but a series of unfortunate and aggravating events caused my plans to change as the B/B cancelled my reservation out from under me at the last minute. Fortunately, after browsing for several hours, I found the Mediterranean and oh, how GLAD I am that I did. I can't say enough about the service every step of the way, from start to finish. Well kept property for the price, perfect location (close to the Needle, on three bus lines, 24 hour Safeway across the street, the list goes on and on), nice amenities and beautiful sunrise and sunset views from the rooftop deck. Would most definitely stay there again.

<Content>Not a good experience I booked this hotel for a special occassion. I did it on a hotel booking website as a gift to someone. When they arrived they were treated so rudely I couldn't believe it. As a frequent business traveler I have never had such a poor experience. The rudeness went right up the line to the general manager. My travel service had to step in and save the day. They blamed me for everything. I was so dissappointed.

<Content>Pretty good for the price and location We stayed at the Mediterranean while attending a wedding over a long weekend earlier this month. While it's a bit of a drive from the airport, the location made it convenient to all the areas of Seattle we wanted to see- the Public Market, the docks, the Space Needle, etc. The neighborhood was safe and had a lot of different restaurants/coffee shops available. Our room was average size and the queen bed was fine. We didn't have air conditioning- but with the window open (ours faced an alley) or the fan on, the room was a good temp and we couldn't hear anything from the street. The bathrooms needed an update, but it was nice having a kitchenette w/fridge. Overall, the hotel was clean, and convenient for our needs. The price was reasonable for the quality- and the roof deck made up for anything that might have been lacking.

<Content>Would Have, Could Have, Should Have been Better My boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in early August. I knew about the AC issue in advance and asked for an additional fan that they provided in the room. Overall, the place was decent, but I probably wouldn鈥檛 stay here again, as for $130 bucks a night, even in expensive Seattle, I鈥檓 convinced we could do better.Pros: Large room and bath; fridge and microwave bar kitchen; 3 free internet accessible computers in lobby; Great car service to airport (Mamu鈥檚). Good location.Con鈥檚: The bed, the bed the bed: It seems for all the cash the hotel may have spent on the kitchenette, they subtracted from the bed. We had a double bed (i.e., the size between queen and twin) for 2 people. It was a tight fit to say the least. This LITTLE TINY Bed in this gigantic room seemed ridiculous; The double bed we did get was HORRIBLE, with a sag in the middle. However much we tried to maintain some time of boundary in the tiny bed, my dude and I literally rolled into one another while trying to claw out of the pit. I agree with the previous poster that the place should have free wireless internet service. It just seems really cheap these days to not provide it to guests (especially when the whole town is practically wired).Not a bad place, but you could do better.

<Content>It is what it is -- but does that well This inn is nothing fancy, but it is clean and met our basic needs for a long weekend in Seattle. I appreciated the 2 bottled waters we found daily in the fridge, microwave popcorn, and Starbucks coffee for the coffee maker -- all free of charge. It was a touch loud outside, but not bad at all. We saved a couple bucks by getting a AAA discount and getting a room with a ceiling fan and oscillating floor fan instead of opting for A/C. It was August and we were completely comfortable (I cannot sleep if I'm hot). The neighborhood is decent. If you're in a walking mood, walk straight up (literally, straight up) Queen Anne and turn left at Highland for an amazing view! Probably just as good as the Space Needle's, and free. :) We also walked to Pike Place Market -- it's a good 30 minute walk, but it was pleasant enough and we didn't seem to go thru any seedy neighborhoods. We also took advantage of the car service -- $35 to the airport. It was prob $5 more than taking a cab, but it was nice to have a Town Car there waiting for us, plus the rate was flat, so no worries in case a draw bridge was up.

<Content>It will depend on the room Okay, we kind of liked it but mainly for its location. We stayed for a long weekend and returned for another five days after we got back from Bellingham. The first stay had us on a warm evening in a third floor room with windows open right on the main drag and it is a heck of a noisy avenue with trucks and cars roaring by and coming off the stop light right outside the window. Reminded me of living in Manhattan on East 72nd. The return five days we insisted on a back room somewhere off the street and that is when things were much nicer and they accomodated us. The staff can be a bit indifferent, though not unfriendly. They seem pretty absorbed behind the front desk. The Starbucks in the building is convenient though I had to laugh when they made a big deal out of cashing a $50 for a $13 purchase. The Hotel does provide bottled water in the fridge when the maid remembers to replace them, no charge. They have a brand new and convenient laundromat on the first floor for visitors. There were a couple of computers in the lounge that you could check your email. Strangely enough in the land of microsoft there was no free internet in the building and nothing to hook up onto either at this location (for free). The location is great, the rooms not bad. If I sound luke warm... well, I am...

<Content>Perfect for ud The Mediterranean Inn in Seattle was everything we hoped for and more. The staff was very helpful from giving us directions to any place we asked  what taxis cost to different areas plus arranging for the taxis. The room was large and comfortable with free coffee packs  popcorn supplied daily. We loved that the windows actually opened  had screens so we could sleep with fresh air. The neighborhood wasn't noisey The neighborhood was great we didn't have enough time to go to all the local restaurants which we would have liked to. The restaurants that we did get to were reasonably priced and the food was delicious. Close to 2 grocery stores one upscale  one for regular people. Can't say enough about the roof top deck. You can see Seattle from there a great place to watch the sun rise or set! Close to the monorail to get downtown which by the way has free buses during the shopping hours. Free internet access in the lobby to check flights, places of interest or your email. We were leaving on a cruise at the end of our stay so having such a wonderful  updated laundry on the premises was definietly a plus. We would definetly stay here again when in Seattle. Loved the location.

<Content>Don't expect much and you won't be dissapointed I have to agree with a couple of the recent posts in that we booked this hotel based on numerous good reviews and a good price compared to anything downtown. The two major problems was that our room did not have air conditioning and the bed was just awful. We settled in too late the first night to realize that our room did not have a/c and didnt realize that a small portion of the rooms do (it isn't advertised at the hotel). It wasnt terribly warm in Seattle, but it was stuffy in the room and sleeping with the windows open is great until 6 am when the trucks begin to drive up and down the surrounding streets.We knew going in we would only have a queen bed, but the mattress and pillows were not comfortable at all.We had no problems with the staff or the cleanliness of the place and thought the location was great. In an old neighborhood with a few local bars/restaurants where you could avoid the downtown crush and a 10 - 15 minute walk to the Space Needle/Monorail etc.If you do stay here, request a room with a/c to allow you to keep your windows closed in the morning, unless your plans are to get up first thing in the morning.

<Content>Really poor quality--A very bad stay. I'm not so sure why so many people rate the Mediterranean Inn as well as they do. This is one of those hotels that's all about show and very little about quality. I chose to stay at the hotel because of the generally positive feedback from TripAdvisor and the overall appearance of the hotel based on the pictures I had seen. But upon arrival, it was obvious that the hotel would be lacking. Generally unlean, tacky decor, and the bare minimum of comforts define the hotel. I've stayed in many Best Westerns that are superior in these regards. Our room was tiny and bed uncomfortable and overly springy, with old and dirty looking sheets. The window was tiny, and despite what you see in the pictures, there are no balconies--just made to look that way. Our refrigerator didn' t work, there was no air conditioning, and despite a temperate 70 degree day in Seattle, the whole place managed to be stuffy and uncomfortable. One of the elevators was broken the whole stay as well. The staff were generally unconcerned about things and there never seemed to be enough of them to handle things properly. The price is less than many other quality hotels in Seattle, but don't make the mistake of comparing this hotel to anything nice. Compare it to a Best Western or Ramada Inn, and you'll still be far happier at one of those.

<Content>Try the Mediterranean Inn Very clean with very good staff. Our room had views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Moutains. Downtown edge neighborhood with great walks up Queen Anne Hill, a beautiful, restored neighborhood with views of the Sound, etc. Close to a few coffee/bakery shops and about a 1.2 mile walk to Pike Place Market. No air conditioning but with ceiling and oscillating fan. In July, we didn't need the AC, especially with our windows open.

<Content>great hotel in Seattle I recently stayed at this great little hotel and was pleased with every aspect of my stay there! It was reasonably priced (for Seattle), the staff was friendly, the location was good and within walking distance to the Space Needle, and the room was perfect for my needs. Taxis are easy to catch right across the street and the best way to hit the tourist areas for just a few dollars. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who desires a quiet stay in Seattle!

<Content>Thumbs up for the Mediterranean Inn Lovely, gracious hotel -- friendly staff, spacious, comfortable rooms, 360 degree view from the roof. This is a great location for strolling, seeing well-known landmarks like the Space Needle and Key Arena as well as hidden treasures: an urban labyrinth, fondue restaurant, quaint book store, and of course, ubiquitous coffee shops, all within two blocks. We'd definitely stay at the Mediterranean Inn again.

<Content>Perfect Seattle Location! The Mediterranean Inn is a great alternative to the big chain hotels in Seattle. It's lower Queen Anne location is quieter and more relaxed than downtown, yet is only a block from the Seattle Center (Key Arena, Space Needle). You can ride the monorail for $2 if you want to get downtown, to Pike Market or the waterfront It only takes about three minutes and is actually very fun. There's also a roof top deck with Adirondack chairs for taking in the views of Seattle and Mount Rainier or just watching the sun set over Puget Sound.There are several great restaurants and coffee shops just up Queen Anne Ave. Pesos is great and very popular with the locals. There is also a Starbucks is on the first floor of the hotel.Our room was spotless, as was the rest of the property. The staff very friendly and helpful and there are two computers in the lobby for the guests. The laundry facilities were nice too.All in all, a great place to stay in Seattle. We'll definitely be back.

<Content>you cant go wrong by choosing the med My wife and I stayed at the Med for 2 nights in June while in Seattle for a concert at Key Arena (only 1 street over, maybe a 5 minute walk at most.) We were very satisfied with our choice. the staff was very friendly and my wife enjoyed having a Starbucks just an elevator ride away in the lobby.Our room was fine. The bed was comfortable, the TV had plenty of channels to choose from, the kitchenette worked, and the bathroom was large and spacious. We were in one of the rooms that had no A/C, but it was not an issue as the ceiling fan kept it cool and comfortable. We did open the windows in our room to allow some fresh air in and there was a bit of street noise (we were on the 3rd floor) not enough to bother us but a light sleeper may have issues.It was also great to have FREE internet in the lobby and a business office was also available, but we had no need for it.there are 2 supermarkets withing a block of the hotel and plenty of resturants in the area. If you are going on a cruise, anywhere near the Seattle Center or downtown, I would recommend this hotel for you. all of these areas are easily accessible from this hotel.

<Content>Good choice I stayed here for 2 nights prior to an Alaskan cruise. Based on the reviews from this site and the price it was as expected. Rooms were clean, staff pleasant, plenty of places to eat within walking distance. The short walk to the Needle was a nice plus! Also really liked the rooftop deck, and had a neat view of the needle from the room. The free Internet (with printing to front desk) in the lobby was nice bonus as well.Our window was along a main street and noise could be heard in the room, but the level was not a problem for me. I do wonder if the no A/C rooms might be problem on the hottest summer days but for a stay in May this was a non issue. The room had a nice kitchenette with fridge, microwave and sink. Although we did not use this I am sure it is much appreciated by several guests. Especially, with a Safeway just down the street. There was also a coffee maker but the provide Starbucks packets were nearly expired. Some will surely appreciate the real Starbucks accessible through the doors in the lobby.Overall, for the price and location this was a great choice and would certainly recommend and return to this hotel. Cab fare from the airport was around $30 and about $10 to pier 30 for Princess. Enjoy your stay if you choose the Med!!

<Content>Very Nice Hotel We stayed here for two nights to start our honeymoon and one night before departing after spending some time in Vancouver. The first two nights we had a Queen bed facing the Space needle which was very cool. The second stay we had a full size bed with no view, but like a previous reviewer wrote we took in the view on the first stay.The hotel is right next to Key Arena and Space needle, and is a Monorail ride away from Pike's Place Market. The room was very clean and had excellent water pressure and they give you two free bottles of water in the fridge. The lobby is very classy and there is a Starbucks connected to it. We left our cell phone charger on our first stay and after asking about it upon our return they had it. Definitely check out the roof top deck if the sun is shinning, you can take some excellent pictures. Also have the hotel call the car service they use to take you to the airport, I recommend using this as it is a flat rate and is a much better ride than a regular taxi. Strict No smoking policy, there is a $200 fee per nite if caught. Would definitely stay again.

<Content>A Curate's Egg We stayed here twice within the space of a week, travelling to Vancouver in between to see family. The first room was excellent, with a great view of the Space Needle and skyline. The second room looked onto the car park, but I wasn't too bothered by that, as I'd already taken in the view. However, there was a walled off connecting door, which made the TV in the next room seem really loud. So we got moved.On the first occasion, we arrived exhausted from a 2 night train journey, realizing that we were too early for check in but hoping we might be able to do so. The very nice lady at the desk suggested we come back at 1pm, which we did, although we still had to wait another 40mins. That's fair enough - the check in time is clearly stated. The hotel has no restaurant and breakfast is not included. Obviously I was aware of this when booking, but thinking about it it was pretty expensive considering. This being Seattle, there is a Starbucks on the ground floor. They also provide a fridge and microwave. The location is great for the Space Needle and other attractions. The area is pleasant, although there are quite a few homeless people about. There are plenty of places to buy groceries and food, including a fantastic pizza place. There are 2 screens with keyboards and internet connections in the lobby. You have to stand to use them, which I guess is to prevent people hogging them for hours. The building is modern and functional; hardly 'mediterranean', but not bad as a base for exploring the city.

<Content>Surprisingly thoughtful hotel We stayed at the Mediterranean Inn for 5 nights in mid April 2007. Since it was a budget hotel I wasn't expecting much, but after reading the reviews in Trip Advisor, decided it might be OK. We had a 4th floor corner room towards the back of the hotel which made it nice and quiet, we had a view of the mountains and TWO windows that opened in our room - We had 4 plush pillows, a comfortable bed, large CLEAN bathroom, plenty of towels. The Mediterranean exceeded our expectations. It seemed that every little detail, often overlooked in more luxurious accommodations were thoughtfully provided. Water in the fridge, popcorn, microwave. It even had an iron and ironing board in the room. The room was very clean and the fact that it was a non smoking hotel was great. No lingering stink from smokers on other floors that seep thru the duct work. We also loved the location - about 10 restaurants within a two block wall. Close to the bus to downtown. The Starbucks adjoining the hotel was a plus and the roof top deck was the icing on the cake for us. We will definintely stay here again.

<Content>Good location/value for those who can walk We were looking for a hotel near the city center that wouldn't break the bank, yet keep us close to the attractions of the downtown area. The Med fits the bill for those who don't mind a bit of a walk - though the walk itself is through nice downtown areas with plenty of shops and restaraunts. If you don't feel like making the mile or so trek back after a night on the town, a cab ride from Pike's Market area is less than $10 (and worth it if it is raining). The staff was friendly, and there is a Starbucks inside the main level. While you won't get wireless internet in the rooms, there are two terminals located in the lobby, and a business center with three more computers and printers on the main floor as well. The workout room was unimpressive, but if you are hard-core you will probably prefer to run along the waterfront anyway. All and all a good choice for younger travelers or those who don't mind a quick cab ride to save some coin on the hotel room price.

<Content>Ew, thin walls! Great location (for Seattle Center), clean rooms, comfy beds, large bathroom. But the walls were paper thin!!First night we heard the cleaning people at 6 am (woke us up)! Vacuuming, moving dishes around etc. The second night around midnight--for 2 hours--we had to listen to the people next to us having s*x. No matter how loud we turned up the Tele, we could still hear this women's voice. Not a pleasant experience, I can still hear her voice in my head 2 days later!!If you stay here, get a room that will be isolated or else expect to get little to no sleep!!

<Content>Precisely as expected. This is a great budget hotel in a nice neighborhood in Seattle. I was hoping for somewhere clean, safe, and in a good location for seeing Seattle. I believe it fufilled all those requirements. What it is NOT is a luxury hotel. The rooms are plain, but pleasant and tidy. They provide free bottled water in the mini fridge, along with microwave popcorn, and starbucks coffee. They have basic cable tv, no pay-per-view options but a VCR (! uhm, how about a DVD player instead?) The beds are adequate but strangely hollow feeling, very springy. Still comfortable though. The bathroom is spacious and clean, though the tub is kind of on the small side and the shower water pressure isn't strong like I prefer. The bathroom has a large framed mirror, but it would have been nice to have a full length mirror available in the room. One noticible drawback is that it was a little bit noisy. We kept checking the windows because it sounded like one of them was open due to the audible traffic noises outside.Staff is friendly and helpful. They have laundry facilities along with several vending machines for snacks and beverages. They also offer a free 24hour workout room that was very nice to have access to. (treadmill, stationary bike, elliptical machine, weight machine, they provide towels, apples, fans, and a small tv.) There is a nearby 24hr grocery store, Dick's hamburgers across the street for late night munchies (open until 2am) and really delicious pizza by the slice at Pagliacci's one block down. Seattle Center (space needle, science center!) and Key Arena are both just a very short walk away. The Mediterranean is : Clean, convenient, and friendly.The Mediterranean is not: fancy or quiet.I would recommend it for family or budget travellers, not so much for business or romantic trips.

<Content>Lovely hotel in a great neighborhood My husband and I stayed two nights at the Mediterranean Inn in Seattle in March of 2007. I found the hotel through this site and I have to say it exceeded my expectations. It was clean and extremely comfortable. We had a view of the space needle from our fourth floor room with a comfy window seat. The location couldn't be beat. It is within walking distance of the space needle and Seattle Center. One of the best breakfasts in Seattle is just a block up at the Mecca Cafe. And the monorail from Seattle Center takes you right downtown in minutes. Internet access in the rooms was only a $5 surcharge. Thanks to this website and to the Mediterranean for such a great trip!

<Content>Highly Recommended for tourists!!! My husband and I stayed for 3 nights from February 21-23, 2007. We decided to book in this Hotel based from the Internet reviews made by Expedia/Trip Advisor travellers! Personally speaking, we both are quite impressed with the hotel in terms of cleanliness, customer service, amenities, and the location of the hotel! Hotel staff are very helpful, friendly and accommodating, the one complaint I have is that we didn't get the Space Needle view in our window, although my husband and I enjoyed the Hotel's roof- top view of Seattle during the night!The location of the hotel is just walking distance to Seattle Center, as well as downtown Seattle! Apart from the Hotel, I highly recommend the Argosy cruise tours--Harbor and Lake Seattle...it was such a treat that we saw Bill Gates' mansion along Lake Washington via Argosy Lake Seattle cruise! Anyhow, a definite A rating for the Meditteranean Hotel, for sure!

The room was pretty nice, had a nice sink/microwave/refrigerator with complimentary water/popcorn/starbucks coffee. Nice touch. TV full of stations. The roof deck has a beautiful view as well.Overall nice place. Will stay again for sure. Pretty central, lots of restaurants around. not to mention Safeway grocery store across store, very convenient.

<Content>Bright and cheery place in Seattle This hotel is a true gem! Very bright and cheery even on the most overcast days. Located in a A vibrant, hip neighborhood at the foot of Queen Anne hill. Everything is within walking distance. The rooms are nicely furnished and comfortable. Check out the newly opened Metropolitan Market just a few blocks away for an unforgettable culinary mecca of a market! Lots of good restaurants and shops within a 3 block radius. Just a few block away from the Seattle Center and Bell Town. A nice walk to the Pike Place Market. All in all, a great little hotel in a fantastic location. I highly recommend it!

<Content>Great Place on The Cheap!! Well this place was a total surprise for Seattle. Close proximity to EVERYTHING. My daughter had told us about the place. Totally affordable, across the street from all the Seattle Center stuff, and downtown just a short hop.We had GREAT views of Elliot Bay. Ask for the 6th floor, western exposure.For some extra cash, the underground parking was truly exceptional. Spend the money.Staff was VERY nice and VERY helpful.The only negative was the truly crappy bed. Thin, lumpy, and if someone coughed, you got thrown out the other side.Not too bad for around a C note per night.

<Content>Great Stay I booked this hotel for a two-night stay because of it's close proximity to Key Arena (just one block away), and I was very impressed. The hotel is bright and the rooms very clean (though I would bring a pillow case from home - their's are paper thin). The front desk personel were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms do have a microwave and mini-fridge, but do not have any utensils of any kind, so you may want to bring anything you think you'll need. The bus stop into town is a half block away, the Safeway is right next door (so handy!), there are several pubs, restaurants and fast-food places surrounding the hotel, and you cannot beat the Starbucks directly off the lobby.I would highly recommend this hotel. And if you do stay here, you cannot leave without checking out the roof top deck (what a view!)

<Content>Great location! Nice hotel. My girlfriend and I spent a week at the Mediterranean during November 2006. The room was perfectly adequate, nothing fancy or lavish, but a nice bed, clean, full bathroom, big enough fridge, etc. Not a room you'll spend much time in, but there's plenty right outside to enjoy. We tried a handful of great restaurants within 2 blocks (everything from Thai food to an Irish pub w/great pot pies). There's a nice bar a block away. A movie theater and a Safeway half a block away. The Seattle center is about a 5 minute walk (2 blocks) with Key Arena (see the Sonics while they're still there), the Space Needle (good restaurant and not insanely expensive), a food court, kids stuff, a GREAT music museum (don't miss it!), and much more (lots of kids stuff if you have kids). Also the monorail is right there ($2) which will take into downtown--only a mile away and an easy walk if you choose--and drop you off right in the thick of things in the Westlake shopping center which itself is a 6 to 9 minute walk to Pike's Market. So overall, the hotel is very nice with a decent gym and clean, nice rooms. But what really makes it is the location. You won't need a car or a cab all week! Plenty to do and see. Enjoy!

<Content>Really nice hotel I booked the hotel on the internet a couple of weeks before my holiday as we were looking for something relatively cheap. When we arrived the room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was huge. They even through in some free popcorn for you! Even though breakfast isn`t included there is a starbucks inside the hotel. The location was great for getting to the Space Needle, and even walking into downtown Seattle took about half an hour. I would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great value, great location. I found the Mediterranean Inn on Trip Advisor and stayed there in the spring of 05. I was there in August of this year and was once again very happy with the hotel. As others have mentioned the Queen Anne area is terrific. Lots of good restaurants close by like the Melting Pot and the Five Spot Diner. We drove into downtown but you could easily take the transit just a block away. It's a nice comfortable area to come home to. The hotel itself is basic and you definitely need to request AC if you want it as all rooms don't have it. The bathrooms are small but livable. The rooftop deck is outstanding. I could have spent a day there just reading and ejoying the view. Starbucks downstairs is a nice attraction and convenient.All in all I'd highly recommend the Mediterranean. Great rates in off season. Quite a bit higher as all hotels are in summer. I'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Enjoyable stay I enjoyed my stay here, and would definitely both recommend it and stay here again. While not in downtown, it was easy to get around with the bus (stop a block away, 4-5 lines) and free transfers. The surrounding area (Lower Queene Anne) had good restaurants (Racha, Pesos, Caffe Ladro) and stores (music, books, safeway, drug store). The hotel decor was fine (nothing special and nothing mediterranean about it, a bit dated) and everything was clean. Rooftop view was amazing, free bottled water in the room was great, free internet in the lobby also was helpful. Front desk was extremely helpful with directions, getting messages, extra keys, etc. Not necessarily a place to stay for a romantic weekend getaway, but for anything else, it works.

<Content>A Great Place for the Price Great location, clean rooms, good amenities, great rooftop view. Only a few rooms have AC so beware when you book if it's summer. Easy to get downtown with the bus schedule and stop a block away. Good, safe parking garage below the hotel, although you would not park your large SUV there. I would definitely book again, specifying a room with AC if in warm months. The only thing that would have made the stay better was a slightly more comfortable bed, thicker pillows, and free internet ($5 daily or $15 weekly).

<Content>Very pleasant stay in a great location We just returned from a 3 night stay (over Labor Day weekend) in Seattle at the Mediterranean Inn. I will definitely stay there again the next time I find myself in Seattle. I thought the rates were reasonable, the location is fantastic, and the rooms are great. As for location...it is right in the heart of the Queen Anne district. There are several restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops within a couple of blocks. There is a Safeway just across the street as well as a movie theater. It is also just a couple of blocks from the Seattle Center (the Space Needle, Key Arena, as well as other venues/sights.) If you are going to the Bumbershoot festival, you can't get a better location. We did walk to Pike Place Market. It took us around 20 minutes, so I know that won't be for everyone. There is a city bus stop a block up the street and the front desk staff were very helpful with public transportation instructions. The Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel is very convenient. We got our morning coffee at Starbucks and went straight up to the deck to enjoy the view  the gorgeous weather. As for the room...our room was on the 3rd floor of the hotel, not facing the street. It was clean except for a couple of stains on the carpet. The bed was comfortable and the shower was excellent. The room had a fridge and microwave. They provided 2 bottles of water, coffee, and a bag of microwave popcorn. We did not have air conditioning, but there was a ceiling fan and I noticed that some rooms had oscillating fans so I guess you can ask for one. Our room stayed comfortable since it didn't really get any sun and the nights were cool. We slept with the window open; it was quiet since we didn't face a street. I guess if I had to come up with one complaint, it would be that the parking spaces were really small. I have a compact car, so it wasn't a problem but I would have a hard time parking a big car. Parking was $12 per night, under the hotel in a very secure garage. All in all, it was a great stay and I would recommend the hotel.

<Content>You get what you pay for After searching for an affordable hotel in Seattle for 2 nights, I decided on the Mediterranean Inn. I had read the reviews on this site, so I somewhat knew what to expect. First the good: The location is great....a quick walk to Seattle Center and short drive to Pike Place Market and the waterfront. The view from the top desk was fantastic as well! The bad: Having the windows open because of no A/C would have been fine if the traffic didn't continue to be loud all night! There is a stand up fan and a ceiling fan in the room, but our ceiling fan had so much dust on it we were sneezing when we turned it on. The bathroom doesn't have much room to put your toiletries out. The shower was not bad though. The first morning we were there we went to leave our room and our door would not latch shut. Then both of our key cards stopped working the second day. The people at the front desk seemed like they wanted to be anywhere but there. The beds weren't all the great either. We were in a queen room, but my 6'4 fiance swears the bed was only a double! If you're not looking for frills this place is ok.

<Content>Ok for a short stay We typically stay in downtown Seattle and chose the Med. Inn basedon avaiability and price. It is not close enough to downtown to make it convenient to walk to the shops but you can still see the area from the small rooftop patio. The room was tired and there was nothing Mediterranean about it. Small room issues were addressed quickly and the neighbourhood was full of good restaurant/food choices and was very close to Seattle Centre. Would not stay there again as I prefer the dynamic of the city, but it was acceptable for a 2 night getaway stay, so long as you factor in the cost of the transporation or the time it takes to get to where you want to be.

<Content>Great place to stay! We stayed at the Mediterranean Inn for three nights. Our room was on the sixth floor, it had a great view of Elliot Bay and downtown. Yes, our room had air conditioning, though weather was great and we did not use it. Nice touches to the room included bottled waters in the refrigerator, and a pack of microwave popcorn. The business center and lobby have free internet access, which came in quite handy to check in for our flights prior to going to the airport. They also have a nice laundry area, fitness room and the rooftop deck which offers a great view! If you are hungry there are many restaurants nearby, grocery and drugstore if you forget something-open 24 hours. Also a short walk to Seattle Center, the Monorail is open, $4.00 roundtrip ride to downtown. Waterfront area is a little longer, but you can catch the free route 99 bus at Pier 70 which makes many stops along the waterfront and Pioneer Square/Chinatown. You can walk a few long blocks from Pioneer Square area to take in a tour of Safeco Field or Qwest Field on non-game days. We really enjoyed our stay at the Mediterranean Inn and would stay here again!

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location, No Air Conditioning My wife and I just returned from a quick trip to Seattle. We stayed 3 days at the Mediterranean Inn. The location is great, the staff was nice, the room was spacious, and there was a nice little mini kitchennette. The room also had a great window seat which I would reccommend requesting when booking. The problem was that there was no air conditioning in the rooms! It was a hot summer weekend in Seattle, and the room was almost unbearable. We were in the room for about 30 seconds before I called the front desk to ask where the A/C controls were, and were told that there was none. There was a ceiling fan, and the staff brought us an ossillating fan which helped, but not nearly enough. Luckily we were busy during the day and did not spend much time in the room. I would definitely reccommend this hotel, just not in the summer. Apparently they do have a few rooms with A/C on the 6th floor, which I was told were only $10 more ($138) so if you can get one of those, go for it. I have never stayed in a hotel with no A/C and really can't understand why a nice place like this would not have it. The lobby is blissfully cool, but don' t let that fool you. As I said, I would certainly stay there again, but not when there is any chance of warm weather.

<Content>95 degree heat and No Air Conditioning Most of the rooms in this hotel have no air conditioning. There is no information of this when booking online, nor is there an option to select a room with air conditioning. The weather was very hot in the 90's during my entire stay. The room was completely impossible to be in between the hours of 9 am until 3 am. My heart goes out to an elderly person that may stay here during hot weather. I am from Houston, TX and very use to hot weather; however the temperature of this room was so exteme, even I could not take it. The location is decent, a short walk to the Space Needle, but if you plan on staying here...... for your own health, DO NOT STAY DURING A HOT WEEKEND!

<Content>A gem near the Space Needle My wife and I spent five nights at this quaint hotel in the Queen Anne area of Seattle and we could not have been happier. You can see the Space Needle from the hotel, especially if you go to the roof top viewing area. We had one of the rooms with a bay window which gave us some extra room, and a view of the Needle. The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and eager to assist. While it is not the fanciest hotel in town, it is probably the best buy for your money. And, there is a Starbucks on the bottom floor!! We will definitely return!

<Content>Mediterranean INN Stayed here for 2 nights at 109 per night. I believe parking was an add 12 per night. Hotel seemed like it was redone in the past few years. It is connected to a Starbicks which was convenient. Free water in fridge (small kitchen included in the room) I am prettty picky about hotels and this was the end of our week long trip drive from San Francisco to Oregon Coast up to Seattle. So we were tired after arrving in Seattle, drove around awhile and were outraged by the high prices of hotels in Seattle. We happened to stop at the Starbucks connected and decided to check on the rate. The rooms are very clean, bed was quite comfortable, and the rooms seemed to be redone, in a very basic but clean look. Nothing fancy by any means, but for 100 per night, in a decent location, (walking distance to Seattle Center) some restuarants and shops---probably not the most busting part of Seattle but we had a car by that time and after all the walking in SF, we got a bit lazy and drove a lot around Seattle. Make sure you request a room away from the street because several buses come by at all hours at the night, and without AC. our windows were open and it was a bit noisy. I wok up a few times thinking a bus was coming through my room! Very special roof top pation is a must to have a delish latte from Starbucks and enjoy the views all around day and night. We really enjoyed that! All and all i would recommend this place.

<Content>Good overall stay I would strongly recommend the Mediterranean Inn. For the money it was a great place to stay. The convenience to the buses and to the Seattle Center, the cleanliness of the room, and the roof top terrace were all pluses. Only negative was some street noise but with the fan running, which kept the room amazingly cool during a heat wave, most was blocked out. Plus we were too tired from running around Seattle! Someone mentioned the staff''s lack of familiarity with the Seattle area--but we have found that everywhere in the N.W. area--most people seem to commute to their jobs and don't know about the immediate area. Loved Starbucks attached to the lobby, the Starbucks coffee in the room, microwave and much more.

<Content>Happy with our stay! We stayed here for 5 nights at the end of June. Double room was spacious and the kitchenette was a big bonus with fridge and micowave. Decor was not new, but was really clean. Free internet in the lobby was a big bonus, and the hotel has an internal door linking thru to the next door Starbucks which is handy for breakfast. Staff all pleasant and helpful.Great location for Seattle Centre, Space Needle, Key Arena etc. Handful of nice bars and restaurants close to the hotel, and generally a nice neighbourhood - try 5 Spot at the top of Queen Ann for a great meal if you can manage the walk up the very steep hill! Supermarket and 24 hour drugstore also 1 block away.At least 20 to 25 minute walk from downtown - this is ok in good weather, but worth being aware of. The monorail goes from Seattle Centre to downtown, and should be an excellent way of easily and cheaply getting downtown - but it was undergoing repairs for the whole of our stay and was out of action so beware! Taxi to the edge of downtown only about $7-8 + tip.Overall, if you are happy to stay slightly out of downtown then this is a good affordable choice.

<Content>Good hotel A good hotel and location, particularly excellent for Seattle Center. Monorail not running at the moment but if it was, the location would be very good for Downtown too (we got a bus but it took more time). Room was fine if a little dark but the kitchen facility was a nice touch. Very good value for money - Seattle hotels tend to be quite expensive. Awesome view from the roof! Worth going up there at dusk with a cup of coffee (free in the rooms). Free internet access very useful. Generally clean and well maintained with some good restaurants/cafes around. Recommend Dicks hamburger bar across the road for ice cream with hot fudge topping!A good stay.

<Content>business traveler will not return to the mediterranean I have been to Seattle weekly for the past two months and usually stay at a couple other hotels. I will not return to the Mediterranean - I had a noisy street side room, the parking was $22 a night and the garage was poorly lit, the non-smoking room was slightly smoky, the furnishings were old and not clean (cigarette burn on the uncomfortable desk chair). There are better places to stay for the same amount of money.Potential pluses: connected internally to the Starbucks next door, in neighborhood with good restaurants, particularly Thai and a hamburger joint, says it's a AAA rated location

<Content>A pretty good little hotel I was very pleased with my stay at the Mediterrenean especially for the price. While not downtown we were within walking distance to the Space Needle and what is called Seattle Center. No air conditioning but comfortable with the fan in the room although leaving the window open at night left you listening to whatever or whoever decided to make noise outside...The rooftop view is great, everyone who stays here needs to go and check it out. Beds comfortable, rooms and bathroom good sized. My only complaint is the staff didn't seem to know anything about Seattle. When asked about dining or anything else was told, Don't know anything about it. Check out the Mecca Restaurant down the street for breakfast...told it was a greasy spoon but the food was great, even if they give you enough hash browns to serve an army! Safeway across the street and ATM also across the street..easy to catch cabs or the bus if you like.

<Content>Not so hot I was expecting more. The room was on the first floor, very small. They swear the bed is a queen but it looks full size to me - and the sheets smelled funny. We backed to the alley and there was a lot of noise. Everytime the person above me flushes I can hear it very clearly. I didn't find the staff particularly friendly. I asked for extra pillows (they give you two of the flattest pillows you've ever seen). They told me it would take 15 minutes. They came by almost an hour later - of course, by this time I was almost asleep and didn't want to get out of bed, get dressed, etc... They kept knocking - then called. You think they might get the clue if its 45 minutes past time you said you would be here that I might be trying to sleep.It is convenient to Queen Anne and there is free internet, but I don't think I'd stay here again.

<Content>Great Value, Great Staff, Great Hotel :o) Thanks TripAdvisor for all the reviews, you did not disappoint!My Wife and I stayed at the Mediterranean Inn last weekend and absolutely enjoyed our 3 night stay. The staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. Our room was very clean, the bathroom was decent in size, the bed was very comfortable, the mini fridge and microwave were very handy and the complimentary popcorn and bottled waters were great little perks (which were replenished daily) We had an amazing view of the Space Needle to our left and the Sound to the right! The view from the rooftop was absolutely breath-taking a must see! Very close to Downtown Centre. The Space Needle, Science Centre, EMP and Key Arena are a few minutes walk away! A variety of restaurants within walking distance as well. Close enough but still far enough away from the noise of the downtown core! We willl definately stay at The Mediterranean any time we visit Seattle and will recommend it to our family and friends!!!! When in Seattle check out the Mediterranean Inn you will not be disappointed!

<Content>Dreadful My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in the Mediterranean Hotel on Queen Anne Ave at the beginning of May. The hotel itself lacked totally in character, was poorly decorated (i.e. no window dressing at all, just vertical blinds), the room was very small, the bathroom tiny and there was a 'stale' smell in it. Also, the room we were in the window did not close properly. It was extremely bad value for money as other hotels in which we have stayed in Seattle were far superior and some were quite a lot cheaper that this one. When we arrived on Friday afternoon the staff on duty then and for the entire weekend gave the impression they really did not want to be there! When we were checking out on Monday morning a different person was on reception and she was very pleasant. Our advice is avoid this place if at all possible.

<Content>Great little find! My boyfriend and I spent two nights in Seattle earlier this month and, on the recommendations of this board, stayed at the Mediterranean. The hotel was very nice but nothing fancy. The rooftop deck is a great place to sit and read on a sunny day. There were coffee and coffee makers in the room as well as microwave popcorn. There was also a little office room with computers and FREE internet access which was very nice. I would definately go back and stay here again.

<Content>Can't wait to go back to Seattle! For the cost, the hotel is a great value. It is close to the space needle and the Key Area. We had read other reviews that said it was centrally located in downtown - and we didn't quite agree with that. First of all, the room was OK - we got a room on the first floor right off from the lobby. The staff at the hotel was accomadating and helpful. For the price, this hotel was a good find for us. We are young newlyweds who didn't want to spend a fortune to stay in Seattle for the weekend. The only downside for us was the distance from the city. It took us about 20-25 minutes to walk from the Pike Place Market to the hotel. We needed the exercise, so it wasn't a big problem, but we weren't under the impression (from the hotel website and other reviews) that the hotel that far from downtown (when you read other reviews that say 'centrally located', that's not what we pictured). I will say that the hotel is in a nicer neighborhood. I have stayed closer to Belltown several times for work, and have been weery of walking alone, but I didn't feel that way this time.

<Content>Great value for a downtown hotel My sisters and I decided to go to Seattle for a shopping weekend and the Mediterranean was $100 US less expensive than chain hotels right downtown. I had problems with the hotel website and booked directly and got a price lower than the web price. The room was basic, but clean and nicely laid out, with the added advantage of the kitchen area for snacks. The hallways and public areas were spotless. We had the corner room fronting two streets, so were worried about noise, but the area is quiet after 11, so that wasn't a problem. The front desk staff were all helpful.From the hotel to the Pike Place Market area is a pleasant 45 minute walk or $7 cab ride, and there are good bistro-type restaurants in the neighbourhood. Note regarding parking. The hotel has a well-secured (hotel room key access) parkade under the building. When you check in, park in the loading zone in front of the hotel and the clerk will give you instructions on how to access the parkade. We spent time trying to figure it out beforehand.

<Content>Very good for a short stay My husband and I stayed for one night on our way from the airport to whistler. The room was clean and accomodating, the coffee maker and fridge make a difference. The room was small and the bed a little uncomfortable so it is best for a one or two night stay. The service was great, the front desk went online and printed me out directions to a restaurant I was asking about, it doesn't get much better than that. The parking lot was full the night we stayed b/c of a concert so we parked at a meter an put some quarters in at 8 and moved it by 10am. Saved the $12 so we weren't upset.Not a bad option (especially for a $100 price.)

<Content>Great Hotel Lovely hotel. Clean, friendly, comfortable. I stayed there for two weeks and will definitely be back.The room while basic was perfect for what I needed. Complementary coffee, cokes and popcorn every morning. The starbucks just off the lobby is great; the aroma every morning is just amazing. Has laundry facilities, small but functional gym, and a 'business centre' where you can use their computers for work, sending pics home etc. It鈥檚 close to everything. 5 minute walk to pier 69, 3 minute walk to the Seattle Centre and only a two minute monorail ride to downtown. All in all a great hotel, perfect if you want somewhere clean and friendly to sleep.

<Content>Cozy Hotel. Friendly Staff. Centrally Located My husband and I visited Seattle from Oct 29th - Nov 1st and enjoyed our stay at the Mediterranean Inn. We had an easy check-in and check-out. We had never been to Seattle, so we had a multitude of questions for the hotel staff, and they were very very nice and always gave an answer with a smile - they even went the extra mile a few times. The hotel also had 2 computers set up with the internet, for guests to use w/o a reservation, and then they also had a business room with more computers and printers. The access to the internet was very helpful, when trying to find new things to do and to check email away from home.The hotel is centrally located. Although it is not in the middle of downtown, it is within easy walking distance to City Center where you can take the monorail that takes you downtown, as well as to the Sonics Stadium and the Space Needle. We stayed on the 6th floor and had a nice view of the lake, as well as the Space Needle (if we looked out towards the left). We took advantage of the outlook on the roof, on our first night (when it was dry) to look out at the beautiful city.As we all know, people that live in Seattle drink a lot of coffee, so there is a Starbucks on the lobby level of the hotel. We did not go to that Starbucks, but it was nice to know it was there.The only quirks that the hotel had was the parking fee and the bed. The hotel charges $12.00 a day for guests to park in the garage. Also, the beds were a bit too bouncy -everytime my husband would turn in his sleep, I'd bounce all over the place and I would wake up with an achey back.All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Very clean. Great value. Great location. I just spent a week on business at the Mediterranean Inn and was very, very happy with the experience. One of the things I really hate about most hotels is that often the rooms smell either like smoke or like cleaning fluid. My room at the Inn smelled clean, clean, clean. The decor is simple and cheerful with mission-style furniture, a big TV, and a comfortable desk and chair. Big very clean bathroom, plenty of hot water and towels. Nice little kitchenette. Not luxury, but very simple and comfortable. The hotel didn't seem very busy so I can't say what it would be like under full conditions, but my rooms was totally quiet with no noise from overhead or adjoining rooms. The lobby is warm and welcoming. The desk staff are some of the nicest I've ever encountered. They're naturally friendly and helpful without that trained-to-the-teeth faux friendliness you see at other hotels. My room on the 5th floor had a sweet little view of Elliott Bay and the rooftop deck has a stunning view. Right outside the hotel there are two grocery stores, a neighborhood movie theater and every kind of ethnic restaurant you could ever wish for. (Try Racha Thai and fondue dessert at the Melting Pot.) After work each day, I walked to the top of Queen Anne Hill and found a little park with a stunning view of Elliott Bay, the Space Needle, the city and Mt. Rainier.Getting to central downtown core is an easy 5-minute walk to the monorail right under the Space Needle. Only one thing I could wish for -- WiFi broadband in the room. C'mon, this is Seattle for goodness sake! There is cabled DSL and it's very reliable. All in all, I plan to stay here whenever I'm in the Emerald City and I'm telling all my friends.

<Content>Customer Service? I think not. My husband and I stayed here before attending the U2 concert. This hotel is conveniently located 2 blocks from Key Arena AND has a Starbucks in it's lobby. Who could ask for more?! Nothing fancy- but very clean and very convenient. Our disappointment came when we received our VISA statment and found an extra charge of $50 from the hotel. When I called to inquire, I was told it was because there was smoke damage to the room. There is just one problem: My husband and I have never smoked in our lives! Furthermore, if we had been placed in a smoking room I would have complained and requested a move. The customer service was non-existent. I was told they would not remove the charge. Housekeeping had made the claim that someone had smoked in that room and they weren't willing to accept my word that it wasn't us. I placed a claim with my VISA account and they looked into it. The charge was finally removed after about 4 months. I was disappointed and will not be able to patronize this hotel again. I do not recommend it.

<Content>Weird Beds! Loved this hotel, brilliant value, large rooms with above average kitchenette and bathrooms kept lovely and clean. Slightly strange beds though...... small and not 100% comfortable. Fab rooftop terrace more than makes up for this, wish I was there now sipping a cold drinky!The lower Queen Anne area seemed very laidback with a good selection of bars and great value places to eat, Racha Noodles in particular. We were very glad we choose to stay here instead of downtown Seattle.

<Content>Great Hotel And A Great Price!! Just got back from my trip to Seattle. I stayed at this hotel. It's in a good spot 20 minute walk from hotel down to Qwest Field to watch the Seattle Seahawks play. 5 Minute walk to the Space Needle. Safeway just next door to get your bits and pieces. Rooms are fine and bright. What else are you looking for in a hotel? It had a comfy bed nice shower/bath, fridge, microwave. It was clean and you got loads of towels. Plus free internet access in the lobby. Staff very friendly. I will be back at this hotel on my next trip.

<Content>Quirky basic hotel The positive points- Location: The Mediterranean Inn is located in the best part of Seattle. I have visited Seattle at least a dozen times and this area is perfect for couples or families. Amenities: The hotel offers very nice kitchenettes with microwaves. If you get a chance- take the elevator to the roof and take in an amazing view of the city. The negative points- the bed was the smallest and most uncomfortable to sleep in with someone else. The room would be fine for one person or two very small people.The bathroom was quite institutional with large open garbage cans, ugly hospital like flooring, and tacky plastic moldings around the bathtub.There was only one small mirror in the room- in the bathroom.I won't return to this hotel but if I was a young single 20 something student this hotel would be fine.Kate

<Content>A gem in the rough! This small hotel is not luxurious, but it is impeccably mantained, and it has everything for almost everyone. Located two blocks from the Space Needle, it is walking distance to great restaurants: from a reliable hamburger joint accross the street, to great pizza a block away, to every conceivable ethnic food, as well as fine dinning establishments. The rooms are smallish, but functional, with a sink, fridge, coffee maker, and microwave. There is one supermarket accross the street, and another two blocks away. Parking is available at a very reasonable cost, under the building. The hotel has no restaurant, but there is the ubiquitous Starbucks, connected to the lobby. I would avoid it like the plague! Seattle has dozens of better coffeehouses, some of them part of a bakery. Ask the very friendly and efficient desk staff for directions to Macrina, a justifiably famous bakery, walking distance from the hotel. If you add a nice lobby, complimentary computer access, a small gym, a coin operated laundry room, and the drop-dead-gorgeous view from the rooftop, you can easilly see why the Mediterranean Inn made our six day vacation in Seattle, an added bonus!

<Content>Subterranean Inn with an above par view...... Yes, the view - as posted in other reviews - is amazing, and almost downright breathtaking at sunset (its hard to see the view on foggy days). We just returned from out stay at the Mediterranean Inn and overall our stay was okay. There are some definite highlights to this hotel: 1/ the view is unparalleled to other hotels and really other locations in town -unless you find yourself on a loft deck in Queen Anne Hill, 2/ the staff is also pretty accomodating (e.g. Phil the night manager on call was more than accomodating and the cleaning/service people seemed more than friendly - or so it seemed). 3/ the mini fridges stocked with diet and regular Coke are a nice touch - even though its probably sponsored by Coke as some sort of in-room/in-kind gesture for the customers -whatever the case -its a really nice touch 4/ love that they have e-mail (high-speed and complimentary) on site. With positives, there are some definite negatives too- in my opinion: 1/ if you are looking for a bed that is not squishy, big in size or one with more than 2 pillows - this isn't your place (e.g. its definitely not the W with their heavenly beds, but at $120 a night its definitely not putting a dent in your pocket book either) I did ask for 4 pillows and was ultimately my request was accomodated (but only after a set of questions: 1/ how many people are in your room and 2/ why do you need 4 pillows). Hey, if you've seen the Travel Spies, at least I didn't ask for 20 plus pillows sent to my room and arranged on my bed in a triangle. I was less than impressed with the response to my request but ultimately satisfied with the outcome. 2/ there was a strong odor in our room - primarily coming from the floors --mix of cleaning stringent and bad smells 3/ carpet needs cleaning or refurbishing 4/ stay away from rooms on the street side - above the coffee shop or under the rooftop deck 5/ no air conditioning - this was a big surprise - but we definitely would have been okay with it had our room not been right over the street and the construction going on on the rooftop directly across from us - this isn't really the hotel fault (other than not having A/C as an added expense) 6/ if you plan on having someone at the front desk either hold your items -please beware - someone dropped something off for me and they gave it away to somone else --i wasn't very happy with their response -- something to the effect that we can't help that someone asked for the same item - next time please ask for their name - not that I have a unique name (i actually have a common one), but I don't think too many people just drop by for the same item within 2 hours. Maybe it was just my unlucky day.Overall, this hotel is good for the value, there are some definite perks and some negative quirks.

<Content>I would stay here again in an instant! As soon as we checked in, I could tell that the staff was very attentive to details. We checked in quite early and aside from just assuming that our room was ready, one of the staff members went up to check on the room as well. We had a great view of the Space Needle! Loved the windows that opened and the complimentary popcorn, Cokes, and of course, Starbucks coffee in the room. The hotel has Wi-Fi in all rooms, as well as a very well-equipped business center and two more computers in the lobby for internet use. Oh, and of course, the beautiful rooftop deck with lots of Adirondack chairs!We stayed here for five nights, and while the rooms aren't huge, it was more than enough. The bathroom was bigger than I would have imagined and it came with lots of extra towels.We hope to make it back to Seattle again and when we do, I will stay here. It is close to all major bus lines. In fact, we took a bus to this hotel for a whopping $1.25 a person. You can't beat that!Excellent hotel, especially for the price! Skip looking at staying downtown and stay here. If you are not against riding the bus, it is very close to everything you could possibly want to see or do in Seattle.

There was a grocery store (Safeway) across the street, countless restaurants nearby, and the bus was very close. They also gave us some plates to use in our room. The laundry room was clean and everything worked well. Secure and safe. Great rooftop views. Loved the Med!

<Content>Good Bargin We stayed at the Mediterranean Inn at for a couple of nights at the end of vacation around the Olympic Peninsula. The price is a good bargin compared to other hotels in the city center. The location is not bad and easy to get downtown, which is not far from hotel. We used public transportation. The views of the city and water are great, especially from the roof patio they have at the Inn. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. They also have an excellant laundry room for guest to use. We would recommend this Inn. Note try to get rooms off the street side facing water.

<Content>Great price but... First off I want to say how great Seattle is as far as the people and the community and would recommend it as a place to visit. The hotel was very nice, very clean but my only real complaint was that the walls are PAPER THIN. I mean I could hear EVERYTHING that was said...and done in the room next to me. Luckily I brought earplugs but even then it was still a bit much. The location was greaat, in a very nice neighborhood with a grocery store right next door so I could go get inexpensive goodies to eat. Plenty of places to eat and an indie theatre on the corner. All around great except for the thin wall issue. Also great views on the roof of the space needle which is only two blocks away.

<Content>Great value and location I stayed at the Mediterranean Inn for 2 nights to attend a drum festival at the Seattle Center, 2 blocks away. My single room was very clean and comfortable, and some have views of the water if you ask. My friends were in a very large room with 2 queen beds, and a terrific view. You can ask for dishes and more cups and glasses to go with the fridge, microwave and sink. My room was very quiet at night, the staff was very friendly and they let us keep our van in the underground parking for the day after we checked out. There is not a restaurant in the hotel, just a Starbucks, but there are many restaurants and grocery stores within a few blocks. This was great value for the price and I will stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel! This hotel was a great value and truely a great hotel. From the very clean rooms with very comfortable beds to the microwave and fridge in the room. We had Starbucks in the room with our coffee maker as well as complimentary cokes and microwave popcorn! The location is almost across the street from the seattle center which is close to the monorail and a bus stop. The people at the desk were very helpful on bus schedules as well as arranging a limo for $33 to the airport. I would definately recommend this hotel. Oh, and you are right next to the space needle for a great night view from the roof.

<Content>Great!! Awesome rates for large, clean rooms and a great location. Has a roof top patio with views of the whole city. We had two cans of Coke and popcorn complimentary in our room. Close to everything!! Will definitely stay here again.

<Content>A Perfect Spot I chose the Mediterranean Inn as a start to our Pacific Northwest trip. We needed a hotel in Seattle in a good location with a decent rate. That鈥檚 what we got with the Mediterranean Inn. Its not the downtown location that most people look for but its convenient. The monorail to downtown is three blocks away. The Key Arena and the Space Needle are also three blocks located in the Seattle Center complex. It is a safe area to walk. One block over is a Safeway grocery store. What tops it is the Starbucks in the lobby. Check the web site for a better rate. Be aware there is a fee for parking. There is a lot next door that has overnight parking. I didn鈥檛 know this until check out. Look into it before the hotel charges you. We were very satisfied with the choice. After the review of other Trip Advisor members, they were too.

<Content>A must stay when you are in Seattle Stayed at the Med last week and was very impressed! If you want to stay at a Hotel that has good location, staff, and creature comforts, this is the place. The Hotel staff is very friendly giving me advice on saving money while riding public transit and where to go and what to do. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The inn is also two blocks from Seattle Center which features, theaters, museums, sporting events, the Space Needle, as well as the very convenient downtown monorail which drops you off at Westlake Mall downtown, just a few blocks form Pike Place Market and other major Seattle attractions. I will stay at the Med whenever I visit Seattle in the future. Did I mention the views of downtown and Puget Sound from the rooftop terrace are incredible?!

<Content>Rest your head at the med I stayed here last year and would happily recommend it again. The staff were friendly and helpful without being in-yer-face intrusive. The room was well lit, decorated and equip with everything we needed for our stay and more, the free Starbucks coffee was a lovely Seattle touch and the microwave and refrigeration facilities we requested were very useful, although somewhat unnecessary as Seattle鈥檚 fresh flavours shouldn鈥檛 be missed for a microwave meal鈥?no matter how tight your travel budget. The location is fantastic, everything we wanted to see was commutable by foot or public transport (very near the monorail). As a side issue I鈥檇 also seriously recommend visitors buy the Seattle frommers guide for the walking tours of the city and surrounding neighbourhoods, they鈥檙e fantastically informative and fun鈥?and with a landmark like that space needle as a reference point you need not worry about getting lost :) Enjoy this beautiful city and hotel I wish to visit again very soon.

<Content>If you want to be sure, stay here Stayed at the Med over New Years and I was very impressed. Came over from England with my father to see my sister, we found this gem of a hotel on our own.You can get to the hotel bu shuttle bus from the Airport which runs all the time cheaper than you'd get a cab. Not much hassle involved, either. Once we got to the hotel and while we were there, the staff were top class. We booked a room with 2 single beds, room 605, and it's huge with a great view of the Queen Anne neighborhood and the Space Needle. After a 9 hour flight, the bed was great. They have Air Con now, too, a similar unit to others i've had before and been impressed with.The bus system in Seattle is brilliant, and i'd recommend it over the Monorail, which didn't actually work when I was there. Bus travel is cheap and effecient, there's a stop just across the street. If you walk a couple of blocks over, you can ride for free, but we wanted to save our legs.The hotel room comes with some nice amenities such as the Coke and the Popcorn, a fridge, Microwave and various other things. The rooms were very clean and had a homey feel.The location is great if you're a Sonics fan, the KeyArena is just minutes away, as is the Pacific Science Centre (fun) and the EMP (also fun if you're into rock music). The hotel also has some good Internet access, one quick pod just for browsing while standing, and another terminal in the business centre which has a 30 minute limit for longer Emails.There's a lot to do in the area itself, a fast food chain called Dicks across the street, friendly service and good burgers, there's a few restaurants up the street too. There's a QFC and Safeway right by too so you can stock up on certain things.I'd definitely want to stay here again the next time I come back to Seattle..i'll definitely be back, it's a great city.

<Content>We loved this hotel and its location--would stay again! Stayed just a couple nights this past weekend and we got a great deal on a hotel with a great location and room. It is located in lower Queen Anne which has several little shops and restaurants/bars/cinema in the area, or you can take a short walk uphill to Upper Queen Anne where you'll find the markets and more cute shops and restaurants. Also what is great is that you can walk from the hotel to the Seattle Center which has the Space Needle, The Monorail to get into town ($1.50 each way), The Experience Music Project ans Science Center, The Key Area (where the Seattle Sonics play basketball), and an amusement park. You could also walk to downtown Seattle or Belltown in 15-20 minutes. The hotel room is roomy enough with a kitchenette. Quiet also, free internet service, a small workout room, and a VCR in the room (with BlockBuster across the street). Also, Starbucks is located right off the lobby for those coffee fixes. We'd stay here again!

<Content>comfortable hotel in a great neighborhood I travel a lot on business and love small, homey hotels with cooking facilities--this is exactly that. The rooms are a little small, but very efficiently set up with a cooking area (micro, refrigk, sink, coffee), desk, comfy easy chair, nice bathroom, good tv. Lovely public area, and a starbucks adjacent to the lobby. Lots of good restaurants within a couple of blocks. I've stayed at much more expensive hotels with way fewer amenities. My only wish is that they had some bigger rooms with king beds. staff is friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>real value in a great neighborhood We stayed at the Med for two nights last week. While it's certainly not a five star hotel, it was a five star experience. The hotel is very clean and nicely decorated with a hip sort of ambiance, the room itself was nice enough and again very clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel is well run in general. Lots of unexpected amenities and best of all -- it's located in a great neighborhood in a great city for under $100 a night. I wish I knew a place like this in every city I visit.

<Content>Gives new meaning to sleepless in Seattle If you want to sleep, this hotel isn't for you. The mattresses are so soft they are guaranteed to give you a backache you won't forget. We tried two rooms, but were told all he mattresses were the same and unfortunately, we couldn't book rooms anywhere else within our budget for the remaining two nights of our four-night stay. By the end of it, both of us were glad to leave.The location of the hotel is nice. There are inexpensive restaurants in the area and we walked everywhere--Seattle Center is basically across the street and downtown (and Pike Place Market) is only about 3 miles from the hotel. The staff is accomodating--they were willing to refund us our room rate if we moved to a new hotel. Having a fridge and microwave in the room, as well as coin-operated washers and driers off the lobby was very nice--as was the small work-out room. But our vacation was ruined by lack of sleep.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Excellent hotel, perfect location, and wonderful staff. This hotel should be rated higher that it is on most booking sites. The price was very good and the service was excellent. The staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. We were able to walk to all of the must see places in Seattle. The trip may have been business, but the stay was a pleasure at the Mediterranean Inn.

<Content>Mediterranean Inn - Great location, great hotel Stayed for 6 nights in August. Mediterranean Inn is in a good location, walking distance to Space Needle and public transport is very close by. When we arrived we did not like the first room because of traffic noise and asked if we could be moved to the quieter side of the hotel (ie not with the main street under the windows) and this was done immediately and in a very friendly manner.Rooms were clean, big enough for two, had a fridge and each day popcorn, Starbucks coffee and two cans of Coke were supplied. An added bonus was the free internet access in the Business Centre on the ground floor.There was no air-conditioning but there was a fan in the room which was all we needed. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Mediterranean Inn is a good deal Mediterranean Inn is in Seattle uptown, the Queen Anne neighborhood, very close to Seattle Center. The rooms are quiet enough. The room I had was in the back alley side, overlook some residential apartment's balcony. It had a double bed which might be too small for double occupancy. But I paid less than $100 tax included per night. So I would not complain.I like the idea that the hotel is smoke free. The room and most public areas were clean and decent. But deco there would not remind me of anything mediterranean, except maybe it had a few indoor plants in a courtyard like lobby.There are quite a lot of eateries and grocery stores around. You won't be out of touch like staying in subrub motels. And the front desk staff were helpful and friendly in giving travel information.I will be quite likely staying there again.

The rooms are great with a fridge, free popcorn, free starbucks coffee, and 2 free cans of coke in my room. Centrally located in a nice neighborhood. Supermarkets, coffee shops, and Blockbuster are right there. Seattle Center, Key Arena, and Space Needle are very closeby.I am definitely coming back the next time I visit this great city.

<Content>We've found our regular Seattle hotel! Just recently stayed at the Mediterranean Inn for a couple nights during Prince's Musicology Tour at the Key Arena....had a wonderful time. My g/f and I head down to Seattle at least three times a year and we've been trying out different hotels everytime. Looks like we've found our match in this hotel. We love the area...so close to several supermarkets and restaurants....the rooms are impeccably clean and affordable...and the staff is very friendly and helpful. A very unique hotel in a great city.

<Content>Great spot, good rates, clean. We spent three nights at the Mediterranean Inn. The queen size room was comfortable and clean, with great extras such as a mini-fridge (free cokes), microwave (free bag of popcorn) and fan. The roof is a nice place to relax with excellent views. The location is about a block from the Seattle Center area, where there is plenty to do, and also close to downtown without being right in the middle of it. Staff was friendly and helpful. For the price, it's a great hotel in a great location.

<Content>Great neighborhood, unique hotel We just stayed at the Med Hotel in Seattle for a week and must say that it is an excellent lodging choice for anyone looking for an economic and geographically appealing place near downtown. The Med's roof provides fantastic panoramic views of the city and surrounding landscape, and their laundry room and free internet in the lobby are very useful. A big oscillating fan in the room made the summer nights very comfortable, as did the soft bed. The entire hotel is very clean and staff is awesome. Queen Anne neighborhood is very cozy, with groceries, coffee shops, and restaurants. One can easily walk from the Med to any of Seattle's downtown attractions and haunts. Take care.

<Content>Good location - pity about the loud traffic The location of the Mediterranean Inn is fantastic - right next to Seattle Center, and the rooms (although fairly small) are nicely decorated and clean. Therefore it's a shame that the rooms have no air-conditioning, which is made worse as the traffic noise is VERY loud. We did not have a very good night's sleep when we were staying at this hotel because of the traffic.Other than that, the hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with good bus links to downtown.

<Content>Price was great  Booked the queen bed accomodations on Expedia for $95 and got great value. Room and bathroom were good size and spotless. Plenty of extras -- real glasses (not plastic), refrigerator, microware, and better towels that the $$$ hotel I stayed in the week before.Location was excellent. Plenty of places to eat and things to see withinin walking distance. Area felt safe when walking alone after dark. The roof deck was a definite plus -- great view.I was there the first week of June and the lack of air conditioning wasn't a problem. Might be a factor later in the summer.I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Springtime in the Mediterranean..errr..Seattle IntroductionI stayed at the Med. for 3 nites at the end of April to early May 2004.I had been intrigued by the reviews and the ads, pictures, etc that I had seen online.CostI ended up reserving a room through Expedia. I tried doing it online directly with the hotel, however their system indicated no vacancies. Cost was $125 CDN/nite for a queen sized room. I was a bit late in booking, if I had booked a week earlier I would have saved $10/nite.LocationI have never stayed in the Queen Anne area and must say I like it! Lots of amenities directly nearby and it is a somewhat upscale/trendy residential area.Enjoyed the restaurants and cafe's that were nearby. Safeway across the Street and QFC (24 hrs) a block away. Good places to load up on a few drinks or snacks and store it in the room. Bank right across the street with ATM, as well as ATMs in both the aforementioned grocery stores. Late night you can get a cheap burger kitty corner to the Med. at Dicks. I was a bit off on where it was located. If you look on a map, the hotel is RIGHT on the corner of Republican and Queen Anne N. It is two very short blocks to hitting the edge of Seattle Center. If you go this route, immediately to your right is Key Arena. Several times I cut through Seattle Center and jumped on the monorail to go downtown. There also are a number of transit buses right on Queen Anne a half block up from the hotel that'll take you downtown along to Pike Place Market or Safeco.Room/ServiceThe room was as I expected. Not a suite, but a good sized room, well laid out. Had a 27 inch TV, VCR, Telephone, Microwave, Bar sized Fridge, Kitchen Sink and small coffee maker. A couple complimentary cans of Coke were in the fridge and on the counter they had complimentary Starbucks and microwave popcorn that was replenished daily.No dishes as was mentioned by someone else, you can call the front desk to get cutlery, dishes or whatever else you'd like for free.Furniture was fairly new. Bed was a bit soft, but otherwise fine. Kitchen had a bath/shower combination and everything was clean and flawless. I didn't try the small work out room, but there is one on the main floor. Room service was prompt. I had no problem with noise from other guests. The insulation between rooms was good. Only time I heard noise was when the windows were wide open and when housekeeping was banging around and vacuuming the room upstairs.Hotel staff were efficient and quick. No problems accepting and processing the Expedia reservation. They took a credit card imprint in the event of incidental charges. It was unseasonably warm and since I was on an upper floor, the sun and heat penetrated the window and flimsy vertical blinds. My room had no airconditioning. The lack of aircon could be a big problem in the summer. There were two windows that did open, but it wasn't possible to get a cross-breeze. A floor standing fan of a decent diameter would be really useful come summer and I have no idea whether or not the Hotel offers that. I would definitely check.Sorry for the lengthy review!ConclusionGood location, amenities, and value. Room was clean and updated with everything in working order. I Would stay here again, but would call ahead before booking to inquire about an in-room floor standing fan if I was going to stay during the warmer weather months (june-august). I gave this place five dots for doing a good job at offerring moderate to nice level of accommodation . I am not implying it is a five star type accommodation.

<Content>Queen Size room good value for money! I stayed there for a week. $495 for 7 nights. Big very quite room, big bathroom in a very good spot close to the Seattle Center (Space Needle) etc. Safeway, Starbucks, Restaurants... I loved it.Be adviced that you are charged the full week in advanced, and they seem to only make your room once or twice for the whole week.

<Content>Did not like management I stayed at the mediterranean inn couple of times and did some monthly stays.There were problems: 1) Although most of the staff is welcoming and nice to the guest - the management is not.Jim Farley - the frontdesk manager expects the person to do the housekeeper job (all crumbs have to be removed, trash removed etc). Maybe the reason is that housekeeping does an average job when they clean?And if you sleep in longer and housekeeper cannot enter the room - the front desk manager will be angry at you and believe me - he can display this.Anger is something that the front desk manager can show and can make your stay unpleasant.The rooms have internet access. If you happen to have a virus in your computer and it affects the network then you will likely be disconnected permanently and you will never be able to use internet in your room in future visits. The network is setup that if one computer has a virus then all of the network can go down.So in essence I felt that the management gives you a privelage to stay and not the other way round. The management tends to be rude and impolite.2) Although the hotel has underground parking, high speed internet, and is located in the heart of nice district in Seattle - rooms are small.3) I have noticed that little maintainence is done here. The rooms are acquiring more and more scratches, stains etc. They still look respectable at the time of the review.

<Content>Excellent New Hotel This is an excellent hotel for its price range. If you are willing to spend a lot more money for a different hotel, go ahead. But this was a good investment for what it offers. The staff was cordial, the room was clean and the furniture was chic and contemporary. And there's a Starbucks in the building for late night snacks! The Inn is just a few blocks away from the Seattle Center (Space Needle, Museums) and the Monorail, which takes you to the downtown area in a zip. Though dishes and silverware are not included in the kitchenette, you can call room service and they will promptly deliver bowls/plates/spoons/forks to your room at no cost. The rooms are small, but not claustrophobic. Overall, I had a great time at the Mediterranean Inn during my 4-night stay in Seattle. I'll definitely stay there again next time I visit that city.
