<Content>Clean rooms We stay at this motel for a few days. The rooms were comfortable, we had two double beds, alarm clock, a bathroom with a tub, a mini kitchen area which consisted of a sink, coffee maker + coffee packets, microwave, and a mini bar fridge.You can book transportation to the airport at the front desk with a couple days notice. The front desk clerks with very friendly and willing to provide you with any information you needed to know. Jay was a really friendly guy. This motel was in walking distance to the piers, it wasn't a short 5 minute walk but it wasn't too extreme. Probably a 20 minute walk. There are buses close by that will take you to the downtown area and the piers as well. A taxi to pier 39 was between $10 and $15.It's located close to a little restaurant called Marina's pizza which is worth checking out.It was probably a 15 minute walk up to the crookedest street. It was a difficult walk as the last two or three blocks was straight uphill. The front desk told us that there were no buses that could take you there but once we got to the bottom of the street we noticed that there was public transportation. I would recommed finding your way to the bottom and taking the staircase to the top of the street.

<Content>Wonderful experience!! Good location and good price. We stayed at the Travelodge Golden Gate Dec. 3-8th, 2008. I was traveling with my two grown kids and my son's girlfriend. The location was safe and close to many things. We hopped the Muni around the corner to go anywhere in the city. (Get a MUNI pass and schedule and you can go anywhere). Chestnut street around the corner is full of shops, good eating places, coffee shops, donuts, Johnny Rockets, Italian Deli, Walgreen for anything you need. We ate at Mel's Diner on Lombard (wonderful homemade chicken soup and sandwiches) and the Homeplate serves dinomite breakfast! The hotel served our needs as a comfortable convenient, clean and safe place to stay. The linens were clean and the service was great. We even had free parking for the one day we rented a car. The room near the street is a bit noisy but we had the fan on as the temperature was warm and we slept very well. We were not bothered by any other sounds and the hotel was full on Saturday night. I would stay here again for the price, cleanliness, location. We were very satisfied! Recommended!!! There are stairs to the upper floors so if traveling with elderly I would get a room on the ground floor. Did not see an elevator.

<Content>Nice Location Family of five from the UK touring California. I have to say that when I first saw this hotel my jaw dropped and thought I should have booked elsewhere. However, having got parked (quite a tight carpark) and got into our rooms I was surprised that they were as clean as they were and were quite spacious.The hotel is quite conveniently situated and offered free parking, which when I was looking for a hotel seemed to be fairly unusual and this was the reason I booked it.No problem with the hotel staff and the rooms were kept clean and although appearing to be small, we never had a problem parking our vehicle there.We spent from first thing in the morning to last thing at night out and about and only needed a room to crash out in and for our requirements it was more than adequate. What I have found in reading reviews is that I discard the raving reports and also the worst ones and you tend to get a good idea.I would use this place again.

<Content>Nice stay... Tiny room room but makes the most of a small space. Somehow they manage to get a refrigirator, microwave, and desk in the room all while leaving you space to turn around. A bus stop just around the corner makes it easy to get around. The front desk was friendly and helpful.

<Content>great value for money, good area Me and 4 friends stayed in this motel for a few nights in October and were very pleased with the value for money.The motel is indeed on Lombard Street, which is in fact a section of the 101, but as we had rooms away from the street we didn't have any trouble with the noise. The rooms themselves were pretty much the same as any motel room we saw during our round trip, nothing exceptional but very adequate.The biggest plus is the area, it's in a nice little neighbourhood with shops and some excellent dining right around the corner! We particularly enjoyed 'Barneys' with its 'gourmet burgers'. It's not downtown, but a short busride has you in the heart of Chinatown in no time.

<Content>Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in I have travelled all over the world, spent hundreds of nights in hotels and this was the worst night I have ever spent in a hotel.The room was a cave. Cold, drafty(had to put towels under the door). The bed was lumpy. The towels were so thin you could see them and weren't much bigger than a Hand Towel. The blankets were barely thicker. The pillows here about as thick as a thick crust pizza.You could hear the street traffic. Anyone walking on the walkway outside and the person above us.The only escape was the TV and the picture was horrible.I figured the name Travelodge would mean a better place to stay.

<Content>Terrible and the Rudest people work here! my parents and family stayed here the week prior to Memorial weekend. They booked 3 rooms for 10 people which is reasonable. the hotel manager and owner yelled at my mom for asking a spare key since the key they gave her was not working! he then proceeded to tell her that there are too many of pp staying in 1 room! is 3 too many?!?! maybe 5-6 in a room but 3 is reasonable! plus they booked 3 rooms, giving this guy business earlier in the week.. he then insulted my aunt and kicked them out of his hotel for fear of them breaking his hotel property.. are you kidding?! my family is made up of professionals, nurses, CPA's and will never do anything like this!he must have seen us and saw burglars and criminals! a hotel owner has no place to do that to his guests.. what happened to the customer is right? and hospitality?!? this hotel has neither.. it's really disgusting how they treated my family the week of my sister's wedding.. if i were you i would bring my business elsewhere.. this hotel does not know guest hospitality!!!

<Content>OK for the price if you get a room away from the street. I had a hard time finding a decent place downtown that would allow pets for under $125 a night. This place was the best compromise under $100. It is in a nice middle class neighborhood but is on one of the busiest surface streets in the city so there is a lot of road noise. The top floor rooms have a vaulted ceiling which is nice and the rooms were old but clean. This is an older motel. Having just left a Carmel BB that was not much more expensive than this motel, it seemed expensive for what you got. It is convenient to most of the tourist attractions and there are several decent restaurants within walking distance. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

<Content>a real find Stayed twice in Nov. for a total of 6 nights. Stayed in room 208. Room was very large, clean and newly appointed. Could not fault other that guest upstairs one night were a bit loud. Not a sound from the street. Great number of places to eat nearby. Lobby staff pleasant and helpful. Great location with number 30 bus running nearby on Chestnut street which goes everywhere. Had a different place booked to stay for our second stay but changed so we could stay here again. Motel does not look like much from the outside but rooms are great. I nevere saw the car park full during our stay, in San Fran you can spend as much on parking as you do on your room. Great value for money and will stay there again later this year. Tu Lan resturant on 6th and Market is a great place to eat.

<Author>m1zetern1ty
<Content>very disappointing My boyfriend and i were driving around and saw Travelodge and decided to stay there as we stayed in one before and it was okay for the price. As soon as we walked in, the none of the lights would turn on except for the bathroom, and we called to ask the maintainence guy to come up to fix it. They were only able to fix one of the lights. The room just looks really crappy. The ceiling looks like it has a lot of molds and cracked paint. T.V. wasn't even plugged and you would have to push a huge table to plug it in. Bed sheets looked and felt dirty, which was really disgusting. Limited parking and plus we had to pay. That was really stupid because I paid for parking for the whole night and there wasn't any parking for us when we came back late at night. We were really disappointed with the hotel overall and would not stay there ever again.

<Content>Somewhat disappointing We stayed at the Travelodge Golden Gate three nights (Thurs-Sun) in early December. Initially, I was mildly optimistic that we would have a good stay here. However, I left feeling disappointed and a bit cranky after three nights of broken sleep.The Good:1.) Good location. Easy to find, within walking distance of an IHOP, near some nice shops, pubs, and eateries (just walk one block north to Chestnut St.), near the Palace of Fine Arts/the Exploratorium. 2.) Fairly up-to-date decor with some amenities (TV, microwave).3.) Includes parking. (Parking can be hard to find/expensive in San Francisco.)4.) Friendly staff.5.) Reasonable price, when taking into account the going rate for accommodations in San Francisco. The Bad:1.) The noise. The walls are thin. You will hear traffic from Lombard Street all night long, which earplugs may help block out. However, my earplugs were not able to block out the loud men in a room next to ours who shouted and guffawed from midnight to 2:30 am one night, nor the people who decided it would be fun to repeatedly pound on the walls of their room at midnight another night. Being a courtyard-style motel, and within walking distance of pubs, you will hear people coming and going into the early hours of the night, banging the heavy outside doors to their rooms. I am usually a sound sleeper, but all this noise was enough to break up my sleep and keep me awake for long stretches. 2.) Uncomfortable beds and pillows. I found the beds too soft and lacking in support, which is typical of motels, and which might not have bothered me so much if I wasn't lying awake because of the noise. 3.) Even though this is a non-smoking property, someone in a room near ours lit up a few times, and the smoke quickly infiltrated our room each time. 4.) The parking seemed to be on a first-come, first-served basis. Although we always had a spot, there didn't seem to be enough spots to go around for everybody. Also, the stalls are narrow, so you will have to jockey your vehicle back and forth to fit. 5.) While the room seemed to be clean, for the most part, the shower curtain needed replacing as it was mildewy. The exterior of the building definitely needs sprucing up. 6.) Even though the staff is friendly, they were not willing to compensate us in any way for the three nights of broken sleep. They also do not seem to project an authoritative enough demeanor, hence I think many of their clients realize they can get away with disrespectful behaviour (noise late at night, smoking in rooms, etc.). Despite this motel's good points, I wouldn't stay here again. When you only have a few days to explore the city, you need a good night's sleep to make the most of your days. I might try Cow Hollow next time, which is just up the street from this motel.

<Content>Excellent value for the money! We stayed here for 4 nights in November 2006 and there wasn't really much to complain about! The location is really perfect, they even provide parking space (24h parking can cost over 20$US in San Francisco!). It can be a bit loud from the street traffic, but it's a Motel afterall...The girls at the front desk didn't know where to find an internet cafe (I didn't have a laptop on me), that would be the only possible, minor complaint :-)(You can find internet connected computers at the FedEx Centre a few blocks up Fillmore Street. If you go further up this street, there is a nice cafe with a few terminals, that's even cheaper and nicer!)

<Content>Value for money. I found the motel to be safe, clean and well situated. Its not luxury, but I spent many hours looking for economical accomodation in San Francisco and there is not much going for under $100 a night. We paid about $75 a night and were quite happy.The actual road of themotel is quite busy and not very attractive, but walk up or down a couple of blocks and you reach some really nice areas. You can walk to the center in 30 mins or jump on a bus if feeling lazy.

<Content>Please fix this place up! We stayed at this motel in August, 2006. It is very affordable for the area. But this Travelodge does the name a disservice! It is in the process of being renovated (I guess), and it shows. My husband nearly broke an ankle when one of the concrete steps gave way. Our room was shoddy and the housekeeping was terrible! We had sheets with blood stains, rips and a spider web that was never noticed, even though it looked large enough to trap a person! Seriously, the place is inexpensive and located well enough----but they need to do some serious overhauling in the area of maintainence and housekeeping. There are TWO Travelodges on Lombard St. This one is near the cross street of Pierce and is to be avoided!

<Content>Great rooms, Great Location, Free Parking, Excellent Service My husband and I needed a place to stay in San Francisco before competing in the Alcatraz Triathlon. It was a very busy weekend, and we were lucky to get a room for any price. Although only rated a 2 star hotel, and being over $100 a night, we weren't expecting much.When we arrived, the exterior of the hotel made us believe we had made a huge mistake, however the interior was outstanding. Extremely clean, very quiet (given its prime location on Lombard Street), excellent hot water and pressure, the bathrooms were very clean and modern.The customer service was outstanding. We had to check out at 5 am to make the race start, and was allowed to leave our car in the parking lot of the hotel for free until we finished. When we got back from the race (12.30 pm) we noticed that the cleaners had not yet cleaned our room. We asked the desk clerk if we could have a quick shower in the room, and he allowed us, even though we had fully checked out over 7 hours earlier. The cleaning staff even gave us clean towels for our midday shower.The only point for travellers to be aware of is that the hotel does not have an elevator to get to the third floor. This isn't an issue, providing you can handle the stairs. If you want a ground floor room, you will need to check in early. We checked in at 7.30 at night, and every other room already had guests.

<Content>Lovely place, stayed an extra night I am suprised to read the reviews about small rooms, ours was positively enormous!!! The wardrope was big enough to live in on its own! We had to access our room through the main hotel and I think it was a suite because we had a view over the whole courtyard. The staff were very helpful and when we decided to stay an extra night they gave us a reduced rate as it was a weekend night. Our air conditioning didn't work so they knocked money off the bill. Over all a very enjoyable stay, lovely room, helpful staff. Would definately stay there again.

<Content>Ok, friendly and convenient location We stayed here for one night on Sunday. The exterior was a bit seedy. The room was renovated in a modern d茅cor and clean. We had two queens and the room size wasn鈥檛 the largest but did the job. Once the morning gets started you can notice the road noise in the room, but I did find the beds comfortable. They offer free internet in the rooms and free parking. The street behind the hotel had many little shops and eateries that we did not get to visit because we discovered them after checking out. The managers on duty were very friendly.

The rooms were comfortable and in good condition, clean. The road noise is loud, we bought ear plugs after the first night and slept sound the following two.Very convenient for public transport and eating places, local shops quite good, the area was clean and tidy, we felt quite safe walking around.

<Content>good location The place looks like a dump from outside (to be fair, most of the many other motels along this street do, too), but the rooms are refurbished, if a bit cramped. Ours had two queen beds, and little room for anything else (no refridge). In fact, you had to climb over the corner of one bed to get to the bathroom. This is basic accommodation, nothing more, but the price is good and the location (the neighborhood is called Cow Hollow) is excellent (lots of cute shops and trendy restaurants  bars and both Starbucks and Peets one street over; walking distance to the waterfront area; buses nearby). The rooms are noisy--they face a busy street and the walls are thin (we could hear people walking around in the room above us), so bring earplugs. Free parking is a big plus here. The gentleman on the desk when we checked in was pleasant, but the fellow the next day was not helpful when asked about arranging airport transportation. They could do a better job of cleaning up the exterior to make this place more inviting, but overall, Travelodge Golden Gate is a good value for the price.

<Content>Did the job. Stayed here for 7 nights and must say I couldn't really fault the place.It's nothing to get overly excited about either but what do you expect for that price.It does the job...lets put it that way.The location is definitely very good with easy access to public transport.I found the road which passes directly in front of the hotel quite noisy though,especially in the mornings.All those Harley Davidsons,I reckon.

<Content>Great Price, Clean Rooms, Easy access to all sights! Shuttle from the Airport is standard $14. On approach was a bit apprehensive, its not the best cosmetically from the outside. On entering the room had a nice suprise! Clean and spacious (two double bed room). Ok, it wasnt the hilton or anything, but for the price (and San Fran isnt cheap) it was great. 2 min walk to the Bus stop to get into downtown, easy access to Fishermans Wharf and Downtown. Manager was very friendly.........although i think he must have got comission if he sold the sightseeing tours!! as he asked me about 3 times if we wanted to do one!!! (i would recommend hiring bikes and going accross to the villages on the other side of the bay)

It doesn't look like much from the outside (a nice coat of paint would be needed!) but the Golden Gate travelodge is a nice little motel for an inexpensive stay in San Francisco.Free parking, clean rooms with big TV, little sink and newly renovated private bathrooms. Breakfast not included but there's a nice little restaurant (Home Plate) that serves great breakfasts a few doors down the street.The hotel's greatest asset is definitely its location. Located in the very safe and friendly Marina District, it's only a few steps from Fillmore street and the very cool Chestnut street (lots of little restaurants, stores and food markets). The hotel's only a few seconds from Public Transportation so you won't have to drive when you visit the city.For under 100$ it was safe, clean and well located. For the price, that's all we asked for.

<Content>Not more than ok Spent 3 nights at this motel early July. Rooms ok, clean but rather small and without a wardrobe to hang clothes. We were travelling for a month and had 3 suitcases for which we hardly found space in the room. Fridge and micro stuffed into the room, no place to eat except in bed. Similar to another review, we also experienced unfriendly and not trusting attitude from the owners, demanding our credit card for security even if the stay was prepaid through Expedia, and it was also not the place for asking questions. Location ok, a bit far down on Lombard Street but as Norwegians we're used to walking.

<Content>Good stay....but.... My girlfriend and I have just got back from a month in the States, 9 days of which were spent in San Fran. We stayed at the Golden Gate Travelodge for this entire time. Although it does not look much from the outside, the rooms are clean and of an ample size. However, during our stay the tragic bombings in London took place. My girlfriend and i wanted to know everyone at home were safe, so we rang around from the hotel phone. The next morning we were phoned in our room by the owners of the hotel to say we had a telephone bill for $150, and could we settle up immediately. It is not necessarily the amount of the bill that annoyed us, it was the fact the owners clearly did not trust us. There were a few more incidents where the owners (namely the wife) were not very helpful which slightly marred our trip. Having said all of this, it was clean and is in a good location, I just do not think I will be staying there again.

<Content>Great location/price I just finished spending 4 great days in San Francisco and the Golden Gate Travelodge was just what I was looking for in terms of lodging. It's in a great location with great local places to eat just around the corner. The parking is free but with the hotel being so close to the MUNI stops you hardly need your car at all. I did not have a car while I was there and did not miss it all all. Rocky even suggested the public transportation instead of an airport shuttle to Oakland which saved me about $25. This is the place for a budget minded traveler who wants a safe, quiet place in a great location. I can't wait to go back to SFO and my wife and I will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Upscale trimmings, great location, cozy! Nice location! The Travelodge is just off the Golden Gate bridge, on Lombard street - lots of places around for shopping and eating. Although the rooms faced to the noisy street, we asked and got a quiet room facing a wall. There wasn't any breakfast and the rooms were small but clean and renovated. The shower had great appliances and a Kohler sink. In addition, there was free wireless internet and a big-screen TV. In all, it was convenient and clean, albeit somewhat noisy and without breakfast.

<Content>Travelodge Golden Gate I read about this hotel through TripAdvisor. I was thrilled to discover how wonderful this newly renovated hotel really was. The area where it is located is absolutely wonderful, nearby are many restaurants and there is a 24 hour diner which has the most delicious apple pie a la mode. It was nice to be away from all the crowds of the Wharf. The area is really nice, mostly families. You can safely walk around this area at any time. The MUNI buses are located a block away  take you to any of the attractions. We walked to the Fine Arts Center  the Presidio which are very close. I would highly recommend this hotel to the budget conscious. Plus it has free parking which is a real gem in this city. The staff was very nice and helpful with any questions.

<Content>Great Location Stayed here with my wife and five year old son while on vacation. Very good location. Plenty of very good and affordable restaurants very close by on Stiener St. and the next street behind on Chestnut St. which also has lots of stores and shops. It is in a very safe area,safe to walk at anytime. Convenient to buses that will take you anywhere you want to go in the city. The outside of the property doesn't look like much but the rooms have been remodeled inside and are pretty nice and clean. The only complaint in that regard was the coffee maker. We startd to make coffee once and I looked in the coffee maker where you pour the water and there was mold growing in it. The manager and his wife Rocky and Rose were nice and helpful with directions and arrangements.   Good room in a great location, good value in a beautiful and fun city to explore.

<Content>Good value for money I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco. I stayed there with my girlfriend from May 26th to June 3rd.Its located about 10-15 mins from the centre and the bus stop is 1 block away. The local area has a few bars and restaurants to keep you entertained if you want things within walking distance.Im from the UK  the room was larger than you would find in a simirlarly priced hotel in the UK. Lots of TV channels to choose from if you relax in your room, and nicely refurbished bathrooom / bedroom. Good size bed as well.

<Content>Great, affordable stay at GG Travelodge When we decided to visit San Francisco (6 nights in May) we wanted affordable, clean and safe lodgings. We found all of that in this hotel. Quiet at night in a safe neighborhood for a great rate. Close to shops, cafes and restaurants in the Marina district. Believe me, you'll want to be able to use the extra money on all of the delicious food, the happennings and what have you in this great town. Your hotel should be the place you crash - just that.

<Content>Great location, Great management, Good value This is a small older motel whose rooms have been completely refurbished. While small, they are clean and well appointed. The managers are friendly and helpful - nice people struggling to build a good business. They do their best for customer service. Just a block and a half to the bus line, we avoided traffic, parking problems and costs as we toured San Francisco. Many excellent restaurants within easy walking distance of the motel. We felt safe on the streets at night - a good neighborhood. We'll be back.

<Content>One of S.F.'s best This is an absolutely great place. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are very clean. The rooms here are in the process of renovation and those rooms already completed are terrific. We make frequent trips into the city from Nevada and this has now become our favorite place to stay. There is very good shopping and incredible restaurants within walking distance. We have given up on trying to find parking all over the city; now when we come, we park the car and use the very close public transportation. It's wonderful to let someone else do the driving for a change. Try this place, you'll love it.

<Content>Great location and value I just returned last night from a 3 night stay here and would most definitely recommend this hotel. As others have said, the rooms have been newly renovated and are clean and well furnished. There is free DSL, in-room hairdryers and coffee makers and free parking (which is $20-40/night at other hotels). Chestnut Street is around the corner and has many restaurants, coffee houses, shops within walking distance. This is not the Ritz-Carlton, but if you need a nice, clean place to stay in SF that is walking distance from shops and dining, this is the place for you and a great value.

<Content>Great rooms! I was totally impressed by the quality of these newly renovated rooms. I've stayed in plenty of hotels, and these rooms have everything I want. They include a hair dryer, coffee, free in-room DSL, and some of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The value of the hotel is also terrific. I should mention that they ran out of refrigerators, one of which I requested at the time of my reservation. As far as location goes, you probably know about its proximity to the big attractions, but it is also very close to a huge amount of restaurants. Chestnut St is full of great places to eat. If you don't NEED a refrigerator, I see no reason to not stay at this hotel.

<Content>Nice motel, great location The motel is in an excellent location, right between the Marina and cow hollow. Rooms are being renovated, and are nicely done. There is free internet. The couple who run the motel are very helpful, and trying very hard. The outside is still a little blah, but they are working on it.I would not hesitate to recommend this motel to someone looking for a good room, great location, and reasonable price. I would stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Secret Little Gem Back in Jan 1999, my wife and I just decided we needed a break and flew into SFO and arrived at around 10PM. Driving around Van Ness and Lombard, this was the only place with vacancy. We use to joke about our experience here with the remote bolted on the side table and the bed sank really deep that you could disappear.Last Jan 16, 2005 I found myself in SFO with my son and wanting to show him the place that we've been talking about and teach him a lesson on being FRUGAL at $70/nite I decided to check in this place again. The office was pretty much the same but lo and behold when I got into the room, they were newly renovated, big comfortable beds, wide screen TV and free internet. I couldn't really differentiate the insides of this room with that of a Marriott.How do you spell . . . . bargain?
