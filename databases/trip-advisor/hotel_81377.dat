<Content>the stay at SFDH I had wanted to go for another hotel which was highly recommended but hubby came across SFDH and would like to try it as the comments were quite ok and the price was also reasonable and union square is just a walking distance!!! and so he booked. Nearer to the date of checking in, i saw some not so good feedbacks abt the hotel and i started to worry... but my worries came to an end when we stepped into the hotel room.. I must say it was small but cosy.. the toilet was small but the cleaniness made up for it.. the location of the hotel is another plus point as there are loads of restaurants everywhere!!! Wal-Green is just opposite the hotel which made it more convenient as it's open 24 by 7.. the cable car stops just right at the doorstep too!!! i would recommend SFDH for the affordable price and great location... I miss SFO...

<Content>Overly-pretentious, indifferent service. My partner and I chose the Sir Francis Drake because of its reputation as one of the oldest and finest hotels in SF. Unfortunately, while it certainly had quite a history, our stay was forgettable at best, and disillusioning for the most part. To be sure, the location was good. (But there are a ton of other hotels near Union Square.) Rooms were clean, although tiny. Despite our request at the time of booking for a higher floor room, we were put on the 4th floor, where the noise from the cable cars plying Powell Street were in full surround sound. The amenities were also not as the hotel website promised. The complimentary high-speed internet access was not at all stable, and kept falling off. Cable TV was also restricted to CNN and Disney. The corridor smelt funny for a couple of days - like cat food. The staff were also indifferent. Our luggage took 40 minutes to be delivered. Housekeeping continually failed to replenish amenities like shampoo and notepads. Front desk was also incompetent at dealing with customers. At one point, there was a row of customers queueing up to complain about something or other about their room and reservation. We were finally forced to find another hotel to stay for the second of our two-week stay in SF.

<Content>Old but great Make no mistake - this is an OLD Hotel and in some areas needs some fairly drastic renovation. With that comment in mind I have to say that I could not fault this hotel in any other respect.I last stayed at the Sir Francis Drake some 40 years ago and since my memory was a little vague, I contacted David Watkins (he was responding to comments on TripAdvisor at the time) for assistance. His response was quick and most helpful. The arrangements he made for me were marvellous and I am sorry he was not there for me to thank him in person. I had a Queen room in the tower block with a view over Union Square. There was some noise from the nightclub 2 floors above but it was tolerable and did not go too late. The bathroom was, as many have commented, small but it was adequate.The hotel staff are excellent in the full Kimpton manner. I had stayed a few weeks before at the Pacific Pallisades in Vancouver and my expectations were high. They were met and exceeded. I should particularly mention the doorman, Tom, in his (fake) Beefeater costume. He was extremely helpful both to guests and in fact to any passer-by who stopped to seek directions and advice.I apologise for getting a window stuck in the open position. which necessitated a call to engineering. Their response was prompt and friendly. However it did illustrate the age of the builing.I would have no problems staying there again.

<Content>A new favorite in SF My mom and I met in SF for a long weekend and stayed at the Drake. We absolutely loved this hotel! Prior to booking our room, I signed up with Kimpton's rewards program, which I totally recommend doing! A few days before our trip, I received an email from Kimpton about a one day sale. I was able to book an executive double room for the same price as a standard double, plus we were given 50% off of all bottles of wine while we were there. Check in was a snap; our room was ready, the front desk staff was pleasant and poliet and willing to answer any questions. Kimpton rewards members are given a card for a free glass of wine at the lobby bar, which I quickly put to good use! Our room was great; nice linens on a comfy bed, turn down service with yummy chocolates, enough room for the two of us plus all of our purchases (we did a LOT of shopping). The rooms are typical SF-size. Don't expect a massive room; these are older buildings! We had an issue with the bathroom light shorting out, requiring us to call maintence. The problem was fixed very quickly, and both maintence and our housekeeper stopped by again to ensure that the problem had been resolved and we were happy. We visted Scalas for dinner one night---soooo yummy, I highly recommend it! We also had drinks at the Starlight Lounge, which gives an incredible view of SF. We also went to Sunday's a Drag (a drag show brunch in the Starlight Lounge). The show was fun, but the buffet was pretty awful. We both said it was the first time we had been to a buffet brunch and left NOT feeling stuffed or really full. Tip: they say the show is sold out as of Saturday evening, but if you show up on Sunday morning, before the show, they usually have a few cancellations and can squeeze you in. We did this and were given a table (in the back, however). Check out was easy-I used to tv menu to do so. They were more than willing to hold our bags while we shopped and had lunch before our flights home. In general, the staff was beyond courteous and helpful. We were really impressed with their attitudes and willingness to answer questions. I'd definately come back to the Drake. It is a fantastic hotel for the money, and we actually enjoyed it a great deal more than the St Francis (our previous favorite), which is great since the Drake is significantly less expensive.

<Content>great location, good value We stayed for two nights at the hotel in August 2008. We found the location great and it offered good value for money. We had a King Deluxe room which wasn't huge but had all you needed. Would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Room to Small My husband and I stayed at the Drake for a long weekend in November. It is in a great location, just off Union Square and right in front of the Powell Street cablecar stop.The staff is very friendly and check in was quick.If you like hotels that aren't cookiecutter and don't mind small rooms you may like this hotel. I have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and quite liked them. I did get a very good rate by booking through their Web site. For this visit I booked a deluxe queen room but was upgraded to a queen room in the tower. The room was quite small with a queen bed and a desk with desk chair. There was no sofa or other chair to sit on and was not room for anything more. The bathroom had a tub that needed to be repainted, a small sink and a toilet. Very little room for toiletries.We had to live out of our suitcase because there was little room for clothing. The wallpaper in the bathroom was gouged in places. The door to the bathroom was difficult to close and stuck when it was finally closed.Overall we had a very nice stay in San Francisco, but I wouldn't book this hotel again because of the small rooms.

<Content>Very poor Amazed anyone gives this place a decent write up as you can do so much better in San Francisco. We had a three night booking on business but left after one. It goes wrong from the shabby Beefeaters at the front door. Quite what that has to do with Francis Drake is beyond me. Check in was hopeless. Left to lug cases up long stairs and into the elevator on the first floor. Staff just stood and watched us struggle. Room was appalling. Worn, tatty and VERY small. I dont care if its on Union Square or not, this it looks like something out of a bad porn movie. The bathroom has to be seen to be believed. Its so small you nearly have you feet in the sink if your using the lavatory ! Shower in bath with a grubby curtain. No blinds on windows right in the bath / shower most unnerving. The corridors are simply awful and look years old. Worn and shabby.As for Breakfast ! Well a few boxes of cereal and a couple of bananas in the lobby. Rubbish. Checked out and went to the Omni due to decent reviews here. Miles better for $30 more. Its only saving grace is the very comfortable mattresses.

<Content>Not to worry! I was worried when I read some of the reviews for this hotel. When I got there I did feel that our room was small and I was bothered by a lack of comfortable chairs. I went to the front desk and voiced my concerns to Ryan, and was changed to a larger room with two chairs. I could not believe the way that the staff worked to make us feel comfortable and well taken care of. It was truly a pleasure to stay at this very conveniently located hotel. Folks also seemed to be enjoying the Beefeaters, who were very helpful, and I thought that they too recieved some unjust feedback from some other reviews. I think that this hotel is striving to please and is listening to patrons.

<Content>Up to Expectations After reading so many reveiews for the SFD we were unsure if we had made the correct decision in choosing to stay here. First of all our cabbie assured us we had chosen the perfect location and that soon became apparant. The area was buzzing! We checked in early evening for a 3 night stay. We were warmly welcomed. We did not receive an upgrade as requested but were assured we had a nice room. I asked if I may have a coffee pot delivered to the room. Which I am very happy to say...was.. and promptly.Our room...a dbl queen was clean, comfortable and quiet. Not spacious but adequate and by no means a surprise after reading posted reviews.We did however have a huge closet to hide away our many travel bags. The lobby is beautiful...Harry Dentons was very nice the view fabulous (although the windows could use some cleaning). The front desk was generally quite accomodating although we did find the consierge somewhat frazzled and unfriendly one evening. And yes, we would stay there again. We found it to be good value. One must keep in mind these 'old dears' are just that...OLD. Expectations should be altered to take that into account.

<Content>It's a little piece of history... The rooms are on the small side but in comparison to a NYC, London or Paris hotel...it is comparable. What I enjoyed most was the hospitality. The service wasn't five star, but if you wanted five star, you should have gone to one of the four other luxury hotels. But for the price, you couldn't beat it. And the restaurant was great!! FYI - you can't beat the location!! I was delightfully surprised at the huge tub, the marble floors in the bath, and the view. (corner room). As with all older facilities, yes, there are some small issues, but it's an eighty year old building that has survived. I happen to love older grander hotels with a little bit of edge. If you are like me, you'll love this place. If not, the Westin is just down the road.

<Content>Good stay, except for the bed My husband and I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake for two nights as part of a driving trip down the coast of California. Though all problems that we had with this hotel were taken care of, I would not stay here again.Our check-in was slow because there were many people in line at the same time. This wasn't anyone's fault, but it was a bit annoying. When we did finally get our room, we noticed that it was a smoking room. We had requested a non-smoking room because smoke really bothers my allergies. When we double-checked with the front desk, they said this was a non-smoking room; however, someone had clearly been smoking in it. They graciously changed our room; however, this one had its own problems.The second room, on its surface, looked ok. It was small but relatively nice -- or at least that's how it looked until we pulled back the comforter on the bed. When we settled in for the evening, we noticed that there was a blood stain and several other white stains on the sheets. We found this absolutely repulsive, but because I was so sick that night, we just threw a towel over it and slept on it anyway. The sheets were changed the next day, and the desk staff was very accommodating, but I would still not stay there again.

<Content>Past it's Sell by Date This property has Grand Pretentiousness but it is past it's sell by date.The entrance is grand but drab,The check in old fashioned and un friendly.The Elevators try to trap you between the doors and don't give enough tme to safely get out.The Rooms are adequate, but have no coffee making facility and the smallest bathroom that has ever been designed.Breakfast was a joke. We had coupons as we had booked on a tour and the breakfast included a full American Breakfast. i asked for egg sausage and bacon but was told i could not have two meats ! My wife only wanted fruit but she could not have it as an option to the full American breakfast even though it was less expensive. In the end she ordered an egg with toast from the full American Breakfast then as an idea and I asked her to order sausages which Iate with my bacon !The TV was faulty and the view from the window was bad.Not a place I would wish to return to.

<Content>Excellent hotel October 1, 2008We stayed in an Executive King which had 2 closets and both a tub/shower and a shower. It was quiet, comfortable and roomy; not much of a view but we didn't spend much time there during the day. Nice mini bar, but we were across from a Walgreen's which we used from time to time. The room was next to the ice machine which was extremely convenient. The hotel is across from Sears Fine Foods which is famous for its breakfasts. We went up to Harry Denton's Starlite Room one evening and enjoyed the fabulous view and had wine and appetizers. Very charming wait people. We used the concierge extensively and he was very helpful and pleasant. Excellent location. We walked to the car rental. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Avoid Sir Francis Drake My sister and I stayed at Sir Francis for two nights and it was by far the worst stay during our month long travel through California. We were especially disappointed because we are used to the good service Kimpton hotels typically provide. At Sir Francis, the doorman literaly watched us to unload our own luggage, I had to drag it a flight of stairs to front desk while nobody offered help. There was no concierge on duty the evening we checked in (we actually stoped for advice in nearby Hotel Monaco). The lady who was a concierge next morning was able to give directions but no recommendations. The room was very small with cracked wall and ceiling, the signature animal print robes were missing and the bathroom was so tiny that one could barely turn around. There was no space to put toiletries - we had to have our quarter ziplog bags on the floor! The tea and coffee which is complimentary in other Kimpton hotels cost $3 a piece but is listed as free on the key pocket. The only useful and friendly members of staff were the valets. We asked for an item from our car and it was brought within 10 min. So was our car every time we asked for it.

<Content>Excellent location Really liked this hotel. It was very impressive from the front and the reception area. We'd asked for a quiet room, away from the street and that's exactly what we got!! However, we didn't have a proper window in the room (more an impression that there was one!) but this just made us laugh. Rather more unpleasant was that the loo was backed up and we had the engineer in 3 times to sort it ... unsuccessfully. First guy took over an hour to appear, which I wasn't happy about, and then he was rather rude. Second guy came in when we were out and left a right old mess in the bathroom. By the third call, I was losing the will to live! However, the guys on the front desk were fab and eventually relocated us to another room where the loo did work and we had a proper window with a fantastic view. But one for them to note please - next time you have a problem like this, you should move the guest straight away as (1) it was unpleasant when the first engineer stalked out of our room with the toilet rod he'd been using dripping all over the carpet (2) not nice to come back after a pleasant day's sightseeing to have to clean up after engineer number 2. Location of this hotel is just great though. Bar area was fabulous and location to Union Square and the surrounding area was excellent. Can highly recommend the Starbucks next door where the staff were absolutely lovely. Overall, I'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed at the Sir Francis Drake for 2 nights a Thursday and Friday. We got an excellent rate directly through the hotel on a king room. The bathroom is a little on the small side but was expected being that this is a city hotel. While small it was definitely manageable for 2 of us. The location is awesome and the lobby was beautiful, we enjoyed great cocktails in the lobby bar both nights. The bartender was friendly and offered to make me something great, and that it was. The bellman and doorman were Fab - they were quick to help with our bags upon arrival and departure and the beefeater was happy to take a picture with us. The starlight room on the 21st floor had a strange crowd and was overpiced so I would skip that next time but would absolutely stay at the drake again.

<Content>Exceptional hospitality wraps perfect package at Sir Francis Drake After seeing the mixed reviews the Sir Francis Drake had drawn, I decided to experience it myself and see if it met my high standards. It far exceeded even my high expectations. When I have the good fortune to return, I will hope stay at this property again. The exceptional quality of the hospitality wrapped up a perfect package for a five day stay. The service was obliging, efficient, and friendly. Staff sometimes added the personal touch of addressing me by name. From managers to the staff at the registration desk, from the bellstaff to the incredibly resilient crew of hardy and handsome gentlemen who form the ranks of the Beefeater costume-clad doormen, I was impressed with how everyone on the team exerted themselves to provide a top-notch experience for hotel guests. Rooms- (I had more than one, and loved both) were exquisite, beautifully appointed, great views, quiet, very comfortable beds, and during the warm days the air conditioning worked well. Remember that at the time this hotel was built, these WERE big rooms: houses and beds were all smaller then. I found the room generously proportioned.Lobby and lobby bar - The lobby is spectacular, lovingly restored, and the design of the bar in the lobby defines the space while paying homage to the existing interior design and decor, rather than intruding upon it. There is a vibrant atmosphere in this central space, and the service was wonderful. Restaurant : I visited the adjacent restaurant -- a separate business -- on several occasions for dinner and/or drinks. The service was superb (although the restaurant is popular so if you want a table you may wish to consider reservations at dinner) and the food was absolutely excellent every time.Night Club - There is also a night club on the top floor that has a great view and is very popular. I ventured up one evening and although I had just missed that evening's live music, the joint was packed until closing.In my view the address is the perfect one for a San Francisco hotel. Great atmosphere. Just out the front door many opportunities beckon for people who like to people watch, shop, and eat. Location is fabulous for walkers, cable car devotees and public transit, and taxi. Just a short slide of less than a block down Powell St. puts you at Union Square.I visited a friend at another Kimpton property not far away, the Sorrento, another lovingly restored historic property, and it was also lovely, the friend's room excellent, and the friend's report on the place was positive.

<Content>really overpriced We are Canadians who stayed at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel this September and were really disappointed. This is an old hotel badly needing an update. Our room was so small it had only one small computer chair. We asked for another chair and received a metal meeting room chair. I think our view was fabulous but the windows were so dirty we couldn't see the view. The bathtub was slippery and had peeling paint. There were smokers in the adjoining room and smoke poured through the large opening under the door. We blocked the opening with towels. The hotel offered free coffee in the lobby- but only at 6:30a.m.! We paid $421.00 for a tiny room. Luckily we moved to the Sheraton at Fisherman's Wharf for a beautiful room at about half the price. The doorman in the beefeater outfit doesn't justify the outrageous prices charged by this hotel.

<Content>Very accomodating staff We switched hotels mid-way through our visit to San Francisco due to an allergy attack from our first hotel room. When we called around looking for rooms in the neighborhood, the Sir Francis Drake had available rooms at a very affordable price. They checked us in right away, and were incredibly accomodating. The staff provided us with 5-star service, and we would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone interested in Union Square. Our room was very worn down. It looked like they barely even re-painted from the building's previous owner. But it was clean, and a great location. We would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a deal.

<Content>Great hotel - superb staff We stayed at the Sir Francis Drake for 5 nights in July. We booked the hotel due to its central location just a few steps away from Union Square and all the great shops and we weren't disappointed. Chinatown is also within walking distance and the cable car stops right outside the hotel for getting to Fisherman's Wharf. From the moment we checked in the staff were courteous and helpful. Unfortunately during our trip I had a bike accident and had to attend the hospital to get stitches in my leg. Hilary (the concierge) went out of her way to help by phoning the doctor and the hospital as well as Blazing Saddles Bike Hire to sort things out for us. The bar staff (especially Aaron) were also very friendly always saying hello and enquiring how I was doing. We had breakfast most mornings in Sears (directly across from the hotel) which was really good. We had dinner in EO Trading, Neptunes Palace at Fishermans Wharf and the Cheesecake Factory in Macys. We also ate in the hotel restaurant Scala's. The food and atmosphere was great - very handy when you don't feel like walking too far.All in all I would thoroughly recommend the Sir Francis Drake to anyone staying in San Francisco. The actual hotel is nice but it is the staff that makes it stand out from the rest!

<Content>Comfortable but Anonymous Stay at Sir Francis Drake The best feature of this hotel is its central location and the close proximity to Union Square. Sir Francis Drake has an entrance and lobby which is reminiscent of the architecture that a London West End theatre would have. The charming cable cars- which are symbolic of San Francisco- stop outside the hotel before climbing its way up Nob Hill. The bedroom was decorated to a unique taste, but even by European standards was small. It was clean and comfortable. The TV was positioned parallel to the bed and so you had to turn your head by 90 degrees if you wanted to view it in bed. The air-conditioning worked efficiently but its vent was positioned directly above the bed, making it uncomfortable to lie beneath.America is renowned all over the world for having good customer service and the staff at the Sir Francis Drake was no exception. The Beefeaters outside were a tourist gimmick and this 鈥渦nique selling point鈥?felt somewhat contrived and unnecessary.I had a comfortable stay at Sir Francis Drake but due to its sheer size and the number of rooms it had, felt anonymous and inconsequential.

<Content>SO-SO The rooms are so small...They did not have the room we booked...and in fact could'nt find our reservation at all. Luckily I had the printout of the confermation. Although we were with our 2 children in the room, we had 2 towels and one shampoo. It took three calls to house keeping for that. Party goers kept us all awake two nights in a row...And I wonder if they ever wash the windows? Maybe once every ten years? Next time I will try one of the many small hotels we saw on our walks.

<Content>Great Stay at Sir Francis! We spent five days at the Sir Francis Drake and loved it. The architecture and decorating in the lobby are really fantastic. We got a corner room on the 20th floor with a spectacular view of the city. The room was very clean and the linens were top quality. The staff was courteous and accommodating. Ryan, one of the Valets, was so attentive and professional---he really took care of us. I know many reviewers complain that the hotel is old. This is true and you have to expect certain things when you choose to stay at a historical location--the rooms will be smaller, the water pressure may not be great, and you will be more likely to hear noise in the hallways from your room. This comes with the territory. Appreciate historic hotels for what they are and what they can offer---beautiful and unique original fixtures, architecture, service, and the nostalgic feeling you get when you walk in the door.

<Content>Nice hotel, only a few issues We stayed at the Sir Francis Drake for our honeymoon and overall we really enjoyed our stay. The location is hard to beat, just seconds from union square and right in the heart of activity in San Fran. If you've never been to SF, the hotel is right on Powell Street, which is where the famous cable car trolleys can be found.The concierge downstairs was very helpful in suggesting restaurants, directing us to the proper bus stops, and setting up our wine tour of Sonoma and Nappa Valley. After checking in and then coming back from dinner during our fist evening, we found a bottle of wine and some biscotti along with a note from the hotel congratulating us on our marriage and welcoming us to the hotel (although they spelled our last name wrong, not a huge deal).The room itself was fairly spacious (we were in the executive king on the 8th floor) and had some interesting details. The bathroom was very nice, with black tile, a bath/shower and even a separate shower stall which I thought was an interesting touch. The complimentary soap and shampoo was AVEDA, which my wife tells me is a nice, high-end brand. My only issue with the bathrooms was that there wasn't a lot of counter space and we ended up keeping a lot of our toiletries and other items on the floor next to the sink.There were a few issues, besides the lack of counter space in the bathroom, that we experienced while at the Sir Francis Drake. The first thing we noticed was that our windows, on the outside, were absolutely filthy. It looked as though years and years of buildup had accumulated on the two large windows of our room and, I'd say, quite severely obstructed our views of the city. For this reason, we kept our light-cloth blinds drawn at all times, which was a shame as the view from our room was something we were looking forward to when we arrived. Another issue presented itself on our last night in the hotel; the air conditioning unit (which is located in the ceiling with intake and blower vents) started to leak onto our ironing board, on some of our clothes, and soaked the carpet that one of our larger suitcases was resting on. We noticed this in the middle of the night when a strangely loud *pat, pat* of dripping water could be heard in the middle of the night. Because it was our last night at about 1am, we didn't call the front desk because we decided a repair situation or a move from our current room was not what we needed the night before our morning flight back home. When I approached the front desk to check out, I made a point to bring up the inconvenience with the A/C. The clerk seemed helpful, but informed me that there was nothing he could do to compensate me for the problem since we had prepaid and booked our stay at Hotels.com and had no extra charges to the room. All in all we had a nice stay in the Sir Francis Drake, but it was unfortunate that our final memories of the hotel will be slightly tainted with the issues with the A/C that couldn't be resolved.

<Content>Great location. This is a great place for the money. Be mindful that much cheaper rates may be available on the hotel's website. Don't count on the reservation staff telling you so. That having been said, when I did find a lower rate online they did honor it.The good: great lounge scene; cool decor; great location; we found the doormen to be more than happy to help, despite contrary reviews on TripAdvisor.The not so good: rather small rooms; bathrooms are tiny; showers are even smaller; phone was inoperable until the following day when it was fixed; despite request for featherless room, bed had feather pillows and a down duvet.The bad: $45/day parking; front desk staff couldn't figure out how to email a copy of my bill despite a spot on the check out form to have your bill emailed to you; room windows were absolutely filthy; window in shower did not open; small toilet; single-ply toliet paper (save that for rest areas and airports!).

<Content>Terrific Hotel We really enjoyed our stay at the Sir Francis Drake. The location is great and the hotel is exactly as represented. The staff was very nice (although when we asked how far Napa was, they said 2 hrs, it's only 1 hr). Parking is a hefty $50 per day, something you need to know before you go.

<Content>Nice Location Small Rooms The SFD Hotel is right in the heart of the Union Square District. The staff at the front desk was pleasant but the Concierge was typically not present and or less helpful. SFD has a small lobby bar downstairs which serves some nice mixed drinks. Upstairs on the 21st floor is the starlight room. Caution, if you are staying at the SFD make sure you only stay on the rooms bordering the 2nd (reception hall) and 21st floors if you do not mind lots and lots of noise.Elevators were small and very slow. Remember, this is a historic hotel though. Stairwells for those like myself who do not mind walking were OK but pretty messy. The rooms were small. Our first one Queen Tower (?) was right next to the elevator and two people could not move around comfortably. If you are looking for a clean and reasonably priced hotel in the middle of it all and can deal with small cramped spaces then it will suffice.

<Content>A Very Disappointing Four Days I was booked with three colleagues for four nights at the Sir Francis Drake. Each of us were to have had our own room. However, when we arrived, we learned that the hotel was overbooked and they doubled two of us up. My room (1530) had a steam pipe that sounded like a drummer in a rock band all night long. The apologetic engineering staff told me there was nothing they could do because the pipe could not be accessed easily. It was impossible to sleep that night. In the morning, I asked for another room. They moved me, but nobody ever apologized for placing me in an uninhabitable room to begin with.The hotel is old and the rooms are comfortable, but small. The windows didn't appear to have been washed in years. The configuration of my bathroom (room 1519) was bizarre to the point that using the toilet was a physical challenge (and I'm not big, 5' 10).One night the airconditioning went out in two of our rooms, and the electricity failed in another. All in all, it was not up to standards for was should have been a first-class hotel. The final problem was that on the day of checkout, two of the three of us had unauthorized charges on our bill. Again, we were not met with apologies from the staff, but suspicion (Sir, are you certain you didn't use the lobby bar?).I could have stayed at the Westin, which is just down the street and next time I certainly will.

<Content>Do not stay at the Sir Francis Drake This hotel is old (not classic), but terribly old. Nothing has been updated. No double glass windows. You get noise and light from the corridor and through the windows. The cover is syntetic, which makes you feel either too hot or too cold. The carpet needs to be renewed. The room was smelly. I would rather stay at the Intercontinental. I like classic hotels full of antiques, but this is just old. Nothing there was a real antique, but just old furniture, old bathrooms and old carpets. Very, very unconfortable. I guess this is a good hotel for holidays non-demanding travellers. If you go on business, your expectations will be much higher. Do not trust pictures, they are missleading.

<Content>Excellent Stay at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel Let me start by saying that I'm the cynical type, so if I write something nice about a stay, the place just might be worth a look . . . If you are seeking a grand hotel, a smaller version of New York's Plaza Hotel, then you've come to the right place. With a location in the Union Square district, it is just about as central as you could want to be. They've spent a lot of effort overhauling this building and it shows; just the right combination of old marble and new interior design. Transportation: outside is the cable car, though you should walk a couple of blocks down the hill to catch it, because it's filled to the brim with tourists by the time it passes the hotel. Go a couple of blocks further down the hill and catch the underground. Secret: To get to fisherman's wharf/alcatraz, if you get fed up waiting for the cable car, hit the underground; take it out to the embarcadero/ferry building and then take a trolley along the waterfront to the wharf. A lot less crowded . . . On the return, retrace your steps but at the Ferry Building, walk toward the subway and take the OTHER (Powell/Hyde?) cable car back home, since its not crowded. Get a map from the concierge and you'll get the picture.Shopping: One door down is Saks Fifth Ave. Turn the corner and you are in the shopping district if that is your thing. It's much denser shopping than New York; you get every brand on top of each other in a few blocks.Amenities: Rooms are recently upgraded and it shows. Comfortable and quiet. The staff are exceedingly helpful. A concierge and doorman who actually know the town well and have a great attitude.The lobby is seriously cool. With a two-story ceiling, nice arrangement of sofas, chairs, and a bar, its not too big, just about right. Tourist Attractions: You can easily walk to Chinatown and the City Lights bookstore. For points beyond, the hills can be a challenge; buses are plentiful. Get a 3 day pass down the block across from Macy's. You can buy half price theatre tickets there too. Eating: Streetlevel is leased to Starbucks and an upscale restaurant. We ventured a few blocks out and there are loads of places to eat. If we saw a mob of tourists, we just moved on. There are very few bad choices as far as eating in that area. Oh yes, and if you want to get snacks for the room, go across the street to Walgreens, which seems to be open all night. Photos: I google streetviewed this place and it looks small from the outside, but isn't. They've wisely leased their frontage space to the starbucks and scala's restuarant. Actually, the hotel covers half the block. In closing, a really great place to hang your hat while you're staying in San Fran.

<Content>We will definitely stay here again! My husband and I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake for 6 nights. We read mixed reviews but decided to take a chance and stay here since the rate we got was great. Our room was small as expected since we booked the Queen Petite. It was very clean and the bed very comfortable. My husband called for extra pillows and they were brought up within 10 minutes. The location is great. A few blocks from Union Square and near lots of great restaraunts and shopping. My ony complaint would be the windows were very dirty so we weren't able to see out but they were doing construction below so maybe that had something to do with it. The reviews we read said it was a very loud hotel. We were on the eighth floor and never heard a thing. Overall we had a great experience and will definitely stay here again!

<Content>Regrettable Experience I booked 3 rooms for 4 nights through Expedia.com in August 2008, and given our experience an overall rating of two is generous. The bright spots of our stay were Rachel at the front desk who was extremely pleasant and helpful and the nice Bellman who assisted us at the end of our stay (we had 7 in our party). Aside from these two points our stay was regrettable. I will admit that I have some blame as to the confusion with our room situation because I booked through Expedia (which I will not do again). Through Expedia they had a contract with the hotel for King rooms only (which was not clarified until after booking). As I finalized our plans I realized that I had 3 king rooms reserved and I needed three doubles, again I admit this was an error on my part; however, the treatment I received from the Kimpton reservations desk, the in-house reservations agent and the General Manager (who I emailed and didn鈥檛 respond) was very rude and unhelpful. It was as if because I booked through Expedia I did not deserve the same service as any other guest. Needless to say I was not able to change any of our rooms to doubles but again Rachel was very helpful and arranged roll-a-way beds for two of the rooms. As one of the other reviews mentioned when we arrived there was not a Bellman insight and we were not offered one at anytime during our check-in process. Two of the rooms were freezing cold as it was in the 50鈥檚 during our stay. In one of the rooms there was an inch gap where the two windows should meet and we had to put towels in the space to keep the heat in. In the other room the window in the bathroom did not go all the way up and there was a large opening. In order to keep the heat in the room we had to keep the door to the bathroom closed making it most unpleasant taking a shower in the morning. Requests for additional blankets, towels (since we used them in the windows) and an iron took two to three calls each. We were unable to get the Concierge at all and when someone at the front desk answered they gave us the wrong number three times and then charged me for three calls from our room!! In regards to the Beefeaters that everyone thinks are such a great attraction the one in the evening was VERY rude and the one in the morning was completely unwilling to be of any service, he acted put out if you asked a question. The Sir Francis Drake, although beautiful on the exterior, has marginal rooms at best and a staff that leaves much to be desired. I will not stay here again nor will I recommend it to anyone traveling to San Francisco.

<Content>The Drake - Central location in SF, Rooms nice and updated Our recent stay at the Sir Francis Drake was just perfect. The hotel was full of international tourists and wedding guests which was probably because our stay was in mid-August and also because the hotel is central to the touristy area. My husband and I stayed for three nights over a weekend.When I checked into the hotel on Thursday, I told the clerk at the front desk that I absolutely had to have a quiet room. I made it pretty clear that I wouldn't be happy in a room with any noise since I'm a light sleeper and have had trouble at a different hotel. The request was successful :). Our room had only light street noise. I personally do not care about a view and I didn't have one because of my quiet room request.One thing to note about this hotel is the lacking coffee service. There's coffee in the lobby only in the very early morning hours. This worked out for my husband and me because we stayed on Eastern time during our stay, waking up at 5am and going to bed at around 7pm or 8pm. The coffee was usually taken away by 7am or so. My husband conjectured that they might have had a deal with Starbucks which was located off of the lobby. Another thing to note was that the curtains in the room blocked the light from the street incredibly well. It made staying on Eastern time that much easier.The bed was incredible. The room was a bit tight but not by San Francisco standards. The tv stations were lacking; we probably should have brought some DVD's to watch during our down time.

<Content>Very pleasant experience My 21 y.o. son and I had decided to visit San Francisco and then tour Sonoma Valley. I was looking for a convenient hotel and one that would not break my budget. (My son, of course, has no budget!). I looked at the reviews of several hotels and liked the comments about the Sir Francis Drake. What particularly impressed me was the response of the manager, David Watkins, to the complaints posted by several people who had stayed. (I considered some complaints legitimate; others seemed to be by people who had different expectations of a downtown-boutique hotel.) I contacted David directly, and after exchanging email, I made my reservations.The desk clerk who checked us in, Ryan, could not have been more friendly. He was extremely courteous and professional. When I asked if the WiFi service was free, he said that there was a charge but if I joined the Kimpton Rewards program, there would be no fee. Naturally, I joined. He also upgraded us to a room on the 20th floor. We had arrived a little early, and Ryan said that our room was not yet available but that he would put a rush order on it. My only disappointment came when I asked if David was on duty. Ryan said that David had transferred to another Kimpton hotel and was no longer at SFD. I had really hoped to express my appreciation to David in person. As I waited for the bellman to store our bags, after about five minutes, Ryan came over and said that our room was ready. We were able to go to our room immediately without having to store our bags.We had a nice-sized room with two queen beds. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the air conditioning was excellent. From some of the other reviews, I had expected practically opaque windows. That was not the case. The windows were slightly dirty but cleaner than I had expected. Additionally, we were able to open one of the windows and, thus, were able to get some great pictures without the glass interfering. The vanity in the bathroom was very small, and there was no place for our shavings kits (however, I had expected this from the reviews). We were able to manage this situation, however, with little problem. The location was great. We walked around the neighborhood and then took the cable cars when we ventured to Fisherman's Wharf. I recommend Sears for breakfast (a great restaurant just across the street). I asked Ryan for dinner recommendations at Fisherman's Wharf, and he recommended Scoma's. My son and I dined there that night, and it was excellent.I highly recommend SFD. I note that the new manager continues David's practice of monitoring this website and trying to solve probems that guests have encountered. That speaks highly of the Kimpton group of hotels.

<Content>Not overwhelmed by the Dake We stayed in the Drake for three nights as part of our honeymoon. Whilst the hotel is in a great location, it is let down by the size of its rooms. When we arrived there was no bellboy in sight. I ended up carrying my two suitcases up a lengthy flight of stairs.Our room was made up with a spare bed which we didn't request and it took two calls to get it removed. Not major problems but just enough to taint your stay.

<Content>For a romantic weekend, THIS IS THE HOTEL FOR YOU! If you are planning on proposing or wanting a romantic weekend away this is the place for you! I truly reccommend the Starlight Lounge on the 21st floor. with the ambiance, exceptional quality and friendly staff and amazing view! Just simply amazing to look out on SF and see the clouds role in while the jazz music plays! One of those breathtaking moments! ~ScottFirst off it was the hotel reservation staff that made every single bit of difference. I tried to book online and waited too long only to find the price point I wanted was sold out. I called in desperation and explained that I was proposing to my girlfriend in SF that weekend and pleaded that I was on a tight budget. I would rather not start a lifelong marriage with debt in these current times. The reservation operator was %110 understanding and did everything to find a room cheaper even than I had originally seen on the web!!!!!I was so excited that I actually decided right then and there on the phone that it was a sign that I was going to go through with it and propose! I don't think he truly understood what he had done for us! So, when we arrived I proposed in the Starlight Lounge, she said yes!!!!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! We will be back in one year, five years, and forever together to renew our vows, no matter the cost we will come back! You have made not only customers, but friends for life! All the best wishes to you and your staff!Door greeter was excellent!The grand entrance when you walk in and warm smiles made us realize we came to the right place. Great atmosphere for a romantic weekend. So much more personal/personable than a brand name hotel like the Westin. We love the more cosy quaint atmosphere than you get at a big expensive hotel. Not that there is anything wrong with them at all. It is just like we felt we arrived in Dublin, rather than London metro feeling.The watchful caring staff were always attentive, we never worried about our belongings in the room, lobby, or in storage. We just KNEW that we would be ok in the hotel and that made us feel so much safer in SF. You are asset to the city!If you've read down this far and still not sure email me at elliotts. The rest is @Mac dot com. (hope that evades the spammers) ;)Btw, I am also leaving this review on hotels.com.

<Content>Won't be going back to the Sir Francis Drake I left the Sir Francis Drake unhappy, and would not go back. I will start with the basics; room size was fine, with a good walk in closet and nice toiletries in the bath. But there was only one chair, a rolling computer desk chair. The bath towels were coarse, the only towel rods were inside the bath tub. A tiny shelf over the toilet was the only dry place to sit anything. The vanity, a large boxy useless thing, had no shelves or door. The bathroom door wouldn't close. The room had AC, but it was as loud as my window AC unit at home. As it cycled on and off it would wake me up. All of these points my husband and I would've overlooked, if we had not had a bad night during our stay. The SFD was hosting a wedding reception our first night. Some of the guests appeared to be staying on our floor . After 1 AM we were awoken by drunken people coming off the elevator cursing at the top of their lungs. My husband got up, opened the door a bit and told the people to keep their voices down. A young man, in a tux, cursed at my husband and kicked our door in. My husband slammed the door shut and called the front desk to report the incident. Later we spotted someone who looked like security walking the floor. It took a long time to get to sleep after that excitement. The next morning we realized the chain lock had been broken and the door was scratched. So we reported it to a young lady at the front desk on our way out to breakfast. The front desk had not heard about the incident from the night staff, so we repeated the report. The clerk apologized and offered to move us. We declined that offer and asked that they fix the lock. The clerk also walked around the corner and told a 'manager' what had happened, I heard her. By the time we got back from breakfast the lock was repaired. That was the last we heard from hotel management while we were there. The incident wasn't the hotel's fault, but the control of guests at hotel receptions is their responsibility. I expected a Manager would contact us at some point during our stay to check on us but no more mention was made, even when we checked out. It left a bad taste in my mouth. I canceled the one night we had booked for a week later. When I got home a full week after our stay at the SFD, there was a survey from Kimpton waiting on my computer. I completed it, in full detail. Two days later a Manager from the Sir Francis Drake called me. He had never heard about the incident, not after our 2 reports to staff and the repaired door lock. He apologized and explained that even though the wedding party had spent around $20,000 at the hotel, that didn't give them the right to disturb other guests. I agree with him on that. He also said he would tell the hotel catering group. But its a shame that I had to fill out a post occupancy survey to get a Manager's attention. We are not ones to make a stink, but being nice quiet guests doesn't get you anywhere. We were just a couple of tourists staying for a couple of nights. Obviously we ranked far below a pricey wedding reception. The SFD didn't go that extra distance for us. There are other places to stay in San Francisco where we would be treated with more concern, we won't bother with the SFD again.

<Content>Nice hotel, bad staff!! This hotel looks the part and fits in with the real feel of being in san francisco. The lobby is the nicest part of the hotel. I chose this hotel because i didnt want to stay in a modern hotel. The rooms are ok, could do with new bathrooms. Room service is probably the same as average english prices and cheaper than our hotel prices. The location of the hotel is great because the old cable cars are right outside the door and your literally in the main part of the city, with saks, tiffinys and maceys about 2 minutes away. If your wanting to do alot of sightseeing its a perfect location. Fishermans Warf is also a good spot and 15 mins away, alot goes on there for tourists but it is very busy. It was aug when we visited and it is very cold for me!!! Although im from the UK. Make sure you take clothes for both hot and cold weather.The down side of this hotel was the staff, they are so RUDE! They all seem to have attiude, they are not at all helpful and dont seem to care much about the guests. Its as if they are annoyed by you asking questions or asking for help. Iv stayed all over the world and i can honestly say the staff here are not friendly. Everywhere else in the city people have been really polite and helpful.

<Content>You get what you pay for On a recent trip to SF, we stayed at the Sir Francis Drake and I had one of my worst hotel experiences.It started as we walked in the door. We pulled our rental car up to the front and there was no bellman in site. We left our car with the hazards on and carried our own luggage up the grand staircase to check in. When we got to our room it was HOT. There was a window A/C unit that didn't work and a thermostat on the wall. We contacted the front desk after an hour or so of trying to get the room to cool off. They said someone would be right up. That someone never appeared. My husband had to fight with them to get our room changed.We did finally get a new room and it smelled like vomit. We endured the vomit smell for the entire weekend because we didn't want to complain again but it was MISERABLE. This hotel is historic but the rooms are pretty run down. It was cheap at $120/night but you get what you pay for!

<Content>Functional stay for non-representing conference visitors San Francisco is similar to many European cities, but still not. The Sir Francis Drake hotel represents some of those typical differences by being an unusually large and anonymous hotel. The hotel is however perfectly functional, as expected and desired for this particular trip. A surprisingly small room compared to other US hotels I have stayed at, priced only slightly lower vs competition. The helpful and service-minded staff was highly appreciated. The hotel is centrally - and safely - located, with excellent shuttle bus connections to the Moscone congress centre and to the tourist parts of the city. The location guarantees nearby quality shopping and many reasonable restaurants for all your meals. Strikingly similar to the neighbouring hotel Westin St Francis. My recommendation is to confidently book either of them for a short, practical congress stay without required representation. The Ritz Carlton or Fairmont qualify better for the last part, however bear in mind then the cost will also be very different.

<Content>Great location, AAA rate could not be beat, friendly staff. Came here for a conference. The conference rate was $206 yet I was able to book direct for $165....go figure. Anyway, excellent location right on Powell and you can hear the trolley cars ding as they go by. Many, many places to eat. Very clean. Excellent internet signal. Service was good. No problems. Would stay here again.

<Content>Want to sleep? Don't stay here! As a descendent of Sir Francis Drake, I thought it would be cool to stay here. Big mistake. If you want to stay in a place where the room looks nice, but you are going to party all night, this place is fine. If you want a good nights rest, stay away! And is it really that hard to wash the windows at least once a year? The room was tiny and worst of all, the walls are paper thin. The bathroom was so small that you have to squeeze yourself onto the toilet (and I'm not fat). I could hear everything (I won't go into detail) from all directions. Updated windows might help keep some of the street noise from getting in too. On the upside, the staff are very friendly and willing to help with whatever they can. One guy at the front desk even heated up my toddlers food in the microwave.

<Content>Good Kimpton hotel The location is excellent. The rooms are larger than I would have expected, and comfortable. The bathrooms are quite small, but that was ok with us.Didn't have much interaction with the staff, but when we asked for a broken iron to be replaced, it was brought up in less than 15 minutes.The attached Italian restaurant had a slightly impersonal, commercial feel to it, but we had a great experience with the quality of the food. I'd recommend it to anyone staying at the hotel.One tip - if you have a car and don't expect to be in and out much, it'll be much cheaper to park at one of the nearby public garages, instead of the very expensive hotel parking.

<Content>Getting older, not better I stayed in the SF Drake on business for three days. I understand that the hotel is 鈥渁 classic鈥?and tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but ultimately, it turned out to be a hotel I wouldn't recommend.  In the heart of downtown San Francisco, the SF Drake is only a couple blocks from Union Square and Chinatown, and maybe a 15 minute cable-car ride from Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf. The cable-car stop is right outside the hotel鈥檚 front door, which is very convenient. The hotel is 鈥渙ld鈥?in more of a classic sense than a run-down sense. But once you get past the impressive d茅cor of the lobby, it really doesn鈥檛 offer anything exceptional in the way of comfort, amenities, or even ambiance.  Our room was an 鈥渋nside鈥?room on the sixth floor, which means we had a view of the back of another building and, as a result, were subjected to the constant drone of the ventilation/air-conditioning system. This wasn鈥檛 a big problem, but it was like having a bathroom fan going constantly. It was one of the smallest hotel rooms I鈥檇 ever stayed in. There was one small set of three drawers to store clothes, which was fine for three nights, but would have been difficult during a longer stay. At $158 per night (including tax) it was reasonably priced, but the age and the set-up of the rooms made it difficult to enjoy.  The room had various minor problems with it. The bathroom door wouldn鈥檛 close properly, which would have been fine, except that it would gradually drift open and had to be propped closed from the outside. The towel rack was starting to come out of its wall anchors, which gave the room a bit of a run-down look. In addition, the ice machine on our floor and the floor above did not work, so I was up two floors before I found one that did work. I was also disappointed by the hotel鈥檚 business center and internet service. On our last night, I asked whether there was somewhere I could check-in on-line for my flight home and print out boarding passes. They directed me to their business center. Not only did they charge $6 for 15 minutes of internet access, but they also charged for printing pages. The first two pages printed fine. But after I sent my third and fourth pages to the printer, I received a pop-up message indicating that I would be charged another dollar or so. The hotel鈥檚 wireless internet (which I accessed in my room) worked fine, but it is a pet peeve of mine that some hotels charge a daily fee for access. As a hotel guest, I shouldn鈥檛 expect to be charged for internet access any more than I should expect to be charged for towels or shampoo.  The SF Drake holds itself up as a classy, classic hotel. Unfortunately, it is becoming very close to being simply an old hotel. Despite the great location and the good price, I would probably look for somewhere else to stay next time.

<Content>Nice hotel - no complaints.... I just came back from a short trip to San Francisco with my sweetie, who had been in San Jos茅 on business. We chose the Sir Francis Drake for several reasons - the location of the hotel, in the heart of Union Square shopping and dining, as well as a special promotion announced in May on Travelzoo.com (Queen Petite rooms at $99. a night!)Yes our room was quite small (we were well aware from the pictures on the website) but clean and comfortable.Nice linens and duvet. Our room was also surprisingly quiet given the busyness of the hotel's location. Excellent base for touring the city.All in all we were very satisfied with our stay - especially considering the fantastic price.

<Content>Great Location and Price - Loud Street Noise My daughter and I arrived much later than expected and we were given a king bed instead of 2 double beds. We were very weary from the delayed flight and did not press the issue. First the good news: The room was very clean and the bed and pillows delicious. The location is excellent and I was very pleased with the price. However, We had to ask twice for a remote control to operate the TV. Maintenance did arrive about 2 hours after the second request and made sure the remote worked properly before leaving. I had to go to the 13th floor from our room on the 4th floor to find a working ice machine. The plug in the tub did not work properly. Minor annoyances. The street noise was incredibly loud as was the sound coming from the pipes when someone in another room would use their showers. In fact, I one afternoon, I double checked our toilet to make sure the sound of running water wasn't coming from our bathroom! All and all it was just fine. A little room refurbishing/ upgrade and they will have a first rate hotel.

<Content>Another great Kimpton property. If you've stayed at a Kimpton Hotel before, well, you know what you're in for. It is an old building converted to a cool, trendy place to rest your head. I will warn you, some people in my group didn't see it that way. They saw it as an old hotel, with new sheets on the bed. I disagree. The service was great, it is located in a good area, and it is only a $7 cab ride to anywhere. Cab from airport should be around $40 w/ tip.

<Content>Nice hotel Whilst staying with family in the Bay Area we spent a few days staying here in the city. The hotel was easy to locate and in a great central position for shops, trams, tourist spots and other amenities. Staff were helpful although as a Brit I must say that the beefeaters were unintentionally hilarious especially in the 90+F temperatures. Our room, though not huge, was perfectly comfortable and was well serviced. Ice/drinks machines on the corridor were a cheaper alternative to the minibar. Only complaint about the room was the noise from the AC and other rooms, which was mainly due to the fact that a woman next door came in late and screaming, knocking on doors. However a member of staff calmed her down and all other nights were fairly quiet. Our bathroom was also small but clean. The cocktail bar on the top floor was impressive and the full length gowns/tuxedo uniform was novel - the drinks was delicious too! The restaurant downstairs was fantastic and the breakfast very reasonable. The night that we dined there it was very busy and the food was probably the best we had on our trip. The huge Borders Bookshop across the road is a good place to waste time when waiting for you reservation time too! The left luggage service was efficient and check in and out was smooth and easy. I am also impressed to see the manager responding to many of the comments.

<Content>A great experience! Stayed in the Sir Francis Drake for 1 night - 2 rooms in June 2008. Was very pleased with everything - the updated decor, the welcoming and accommodating staff, the convenient location, and the comfy beds! We had just come from 3 nights of backcountry camping in Yosemite, and the Sir Francis Drake delivered in terms of comfort  style. We enjoyed a yummy lunch at Scala's as well. Really, no complaints.  I would gladly stay there again - we got an incredible rate and I'm so glad we took advantage of it. We certainly enjoyed the Drake!!

<Content>Great deal on a centrally located historic hotel My husband and I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake for two nights April 4-6, 2008. There was a promotional rate that applied on a weekend and we jumped on it. I've stayed in MANY San Francisco hotels around Union Square but have never stayed at the Sir Francis Drake -- probably because I thought it would be too touristy. With the promotional rate, I decided to take a chance and I was very pleasantly surprised. We stayed in a corner room with a queen bed. Room had been recently redecorated. Bathroom was cute and unusual, with a window in the shower area (old hotels usually have interesting bathrooms!). Closet was enormous. Service was friendly and the location very convenient. For dinner one evening, we caught the cable car right outside the front door to get up to 1550 Hyde Restaurant. Wonderful experience, very romantic. We would definitely consider returning when we're in the city again.

<Content>great location but not much else Very old hotel and although it has been recently updated some things just remain old. For some reason, soundproofing to the outside street noise is almost non existent. Not enough place to put your clothes (3 small drawers) Parking at the hotel is $50 a day!On the plus side, it is right beside Union Square and the cable car runs right in front for an easy hop to Fisherman's Wharf and other spots.

<Content>Sir Francis Drake Would Be Proud After spending a horrible night at Hotel Des Arts,my husband called Kimpton's Sir Francis Drake. He had stayed in one of their hotels in the San Jose/Cupertino Area the week before for business and was impressed. I had tried a month before to book this hotel on a recomendation from a friend, but at the time there were no vacancies. Sir Francis Drake is one of my ancestors, so I thought it would kind of cool to stay there. Thankfully the staff was very nice and offered us a Tower Room on the 18th floor, for a little LESS than Hotel Des Arts. II was a little weary because Frommers did not rate it very well. They said the Lobby was spectacular, but the rooms were unimpressive, I beg to differ.. The lobby that made you feel like royalty, was a close comparison to our room. The bed was really comfy, the room was decorated nicely, and the bathroom and all the tolietries were also top notch(I always love Aveda products). The staff was very friendly and helpful during our stay. I will certainly come back! I am missing San Francisco already!

<Content>What a DUMP!!!! Like all Kimpton Hotles in San Francisco, we have an older hotel that could be utterly stunning, but has instead had minimal, cheap fixes---so the result is completely ghetto.The room was tiny and worn---but even it was nice compared to the elevators of death I had to ride up in. The staff was reasonably pleasant, the food was mediocre at best. The lobby, while huge and hinting at its once lovely decor had carpet and walls so worn and filthy that I thought at first I was in the wrong place.To me, this is not an upscale boutique hotel----this is a Law and Order set for hookers to hang out and ply their trade in.

<Content>Beautiful lobby, great location, but hit or miss with the rooms This was my second stay at the Sir Francis Drake, having stayed here in March 2008. My group was placed at the hotel by the housing bureau of the conference we were attending. The hotel's location is perfect for those wanting to get the feel of San Francisco. Close to the convention center, right in Union Square, with Chinatown only a few blocks away. For those who love to shop, there are plenty of stores.The doormen are dressed in costume and are quick to help with luggage and hailing taxis. The bellman are efficient and quick to point out the features of the room as well as where the ice machine and fire exits are.Check in was smooth and effortless, even when I forgot my Kimpton rewards number. The staff member kindly looked it up and added it to my reservation. The lobby of the hotel is magnificent, with high ceilings, comfortable sofas and chairs, and a nicely stocked bar. Aaron, one of the bartenders, is delightful and charming as well as creative. He was mixing up new drinks and explaining to the patrons the different tastes he was going for. There were a few of us there on business, so it was nice to have an engaging bartender. The elevators are small but relatively quick. During my first stay in March, I was on the 10th floor and had a decently sized room. The TV was on the dresser at the foot of the bed, so viewing wasn't an issue. The bathroom, however, was very small with little storage space for my toiletries. For a one-night stay, that's OK, but for the May trip, I was there for 7 days, so the lack of space became tedious.The bath amenities are Aveda products, which are my personal favorites. The tub is deep and the shower had good water pressure. For my second stay in May, I was on the 7th floor, close to the elevator. My room was tricky to get to, since it was tucked away in a side hall. The space was considerably smaller -- reminding me of a European hotel room -- and the TV was on the dresser that was parallel to the bed. Yes, viewing was a bit of a pain in the evening but it wasn't too bad.The real eyesore in the room was the left-over in-window AC/heating unit. The Sir Francis Drake now has central heating/air with individual temperature controls. While I didn't have a problem with mine, several of my colleagues complained that their AC didn't work. It, of course, had to be a freakish heatwave that hit in May, with temperatures well into the high 90's. Kudos for complimentary wireless internet access, but my telephone didn't work even after maintenance repaired it once. It's hard to order room service when the only phone in the room doesn't work.The business center is located in the lobby and has two pay-per-use computers. Unfortunately, the first computer I tried to use wouldn't recognize my memory stick and the printer connect to the second one constantly jammed. Of course, I was trying to print out documents for a meeting that was starting in 15 minutes. Three cheers for Elgin at the front desk, who tried to fix the printer and the understanding that I was under the gun, took the memory stick, printed the file and made the number of copies I needed. Because I had so much trouble with the machines, he didn't charge me for the copies. So... while my coworkers' experiences were particularly good, I didn't have problems with my room (except that the bathroom had no storage). It seems that it all depends on the luck of the draw with rooms. You'll either get one that has a decent amount of space or one that's cramped with things that don't quite work. Regardless, it is a beautiful hotel and I'm willing to stay here again as long as Aaron's at the bar and Elgin's behind the front desk.

<Author>SD_based
<Content>a great value and exceptional service -- one of the best in the city! The Sir Francis Drake is managed by the Kimpton group and reflects that company's high standards of service. As with most downtown lodging, it is a *hotel* and not a *resort* in the comptemporary sense of the latter. That being said, there are a number of resort-like amenities available -- such as the spa, fitness center and business center.VALUE: If Union Square is your desired base of operations for your stay in San Francisco, the Sir Francis Drake offers some outstanding deals thourgh their online booking website. We were able to stay three nights for one-third the lowest rate offered by the Westin St. Francis just down the block. In this economy, that is a significant savings without giving up much in terms of luxury or amenities. LOCATION: You truly can't beat the location. a block up Powell Street from Union Square and all of the shopping that district has to offer. The cable cars stop right out in front of the hotel. The famous Dragon Gate entrance to Chinatown is walking distance four short blocks away.THE ROOMS: Ours was a 'Double Deluxe' with two very comfortable double beds. The room decor was very nice and fresh. The room itself was very clean and plenty large enough for my wife and I. Contrary to what others have written, the bathroom was every bit as large as you will find in most other three- and four-star hotels. If I were to have any concerns whatsoever about our room it was how few electrical outlets there were -- but I would only deem that a minor inconvenience.PEACE AND QUIET: Yes, the walls are somewhat thin and occasionally, we could hear the folks in the room next door trying to deal with their children. However, we did *not* hear the street noise others allude to. I suspect that is only an issue on rooms facing the street along the front of the building. Nor did we ever hear anything from the Starlight Room. Overall, it is a very quiet building for the most part.SERVICE: From the time we checked in and throughout our stay, every hotel staff member we interacted with was friendly and helpful. There was even a situation when we ran out of shampoo and called later in the evening to request an additional one from housekeeping. By this time, the housekeeping staff were not available, but in less than five minutes of calling guest services, shampoo was brought to our 7th-floor room by one of the building maintenance staff.FOOD: In addition to an excellent restaurant (Scala's Bistro) onsite, there are several dining options within a short walk. The famous Sears Fine Food restaurant (home of the Swedish pancakes) is directly across the street. Up on the corner is one of several downtown Lori's Diner locations. The Cheesecake factory is down the street atop Macy's Union Square store. Other eateries large and small abound.OTHER COMMENTS: Others had complained about slow and creaky elevators, but we rode all four and all were modern, quiet and efficient. Nothing to worry about there. We highly recommend the Sir Francis Drake and are planning to stay there again on our next visit to San Francisco.TRANSPORTATION TIP: If you are flying into San Francisco, skip the rental car unless you are going to be taking day trips outside of the city. Street parking is nearly non-existent and traffic tight in the central city and parking garages are expensive. Valet parking at the Sir Francis Drake was $44/day at the time of our visit. Instead, take BART (Pittsburg/Bay Point train) directly from the airport's international terminal to downtown (Powell Street station) and the hotel is 4陆 blocks up Powell. Stop by the Muni tranit kiosk next to the cable car terminus and buy a Muni 1-day or 3-day passport for unlimited cable car, streetcar, metro and bus rides

<Content>Location and Service I stayed here for 2008 GDC (which was at the Moscone Center). It's a bit of a walk to there if you are not use to walking in a dense city. However, the location is great for everything. Plenty of restaurants and shopping (well, expensive shopping). Service was excellent. Little small, but that is what I expected. Don't expect to be able to see out of your window well either, but that wasn't an issue. The staff was top notch when I was there (sometimes these things change though). Let's just hit the bullets:Pros:- Location- Ambiance/Lobby- Good price for that Location and type of HotelCons:- Restaurant/Club overpriced.- Parking expensive (but you wouldn't need it anyways)

<Content>i was disappointed and room was dangerous Stayed at the hotel for a business conference and extended our stay to see sights and family in the area. Booked our stay through the Kimpton program and then confirmed the room and specific requests (crib, coffee pot, childproofing items) that were available to Kimpton members. Checkin was prompt and pleasant. Room on initial inspection was clean, nice decor and small bathroom with deep tub. We had to call multiple times for the crib and coffee pot over the next coupla hours before they were received. Childproofing items were never received. On our fouth night there the air conditioning broke. Early the next morning I informed the front desk of the problem. At lunch I reminded them again. That afternoon I called twice due to the room being too hot for the kiddos to nap. Room temperature exceeded 85 degrees. Still no maintenance service. Spoke to someone at the front desk again on the way out to dinner. After dinner, no one had looked at the room yet. Went back down to the front desk and let them know that I was very unhappy at this point. Twenty minutes later maintenance finally arrived. (It's now 9.30 pm and the 3 year old and 3 month old are hot and tired. We have an early flight home in the morning) Arturo,the maintenance man, fixed a pressure problem and left. An hour later the air conditioning quit working again. We decided it was hopeless at this point and decided to go to bed. My husband thought to check the window to see if we could get any fresh air. The window opened easily!! We had specificly been put in this room on the 11th floor to meet fire code with the crib. My 3 year-old son had spent a good portion of the time in the room sitting of the window sill looking out the window. He would've been able to easily open it. The other window was barely fasted close with a screw.I informed the front desk on the continued AC problems and the danger of the windows as we were quickly leaving for the airport. I love old hotels. I prefer the character and history of them to the mass-produced chains. This is the primary reason I selected this hotel. Hopefully, the problems will be promptly fixed. But personally, I have grave misgivings about staying somewhere where my child's life was in danger.

<Content>Great Lobby Ok Rooms Classic lobby. You will be immediately impressed walking into the hotel (after you find it). Hotel is what you call a vintage location, the type of place you see in movies from the 40s. The bad news is rooms are small...really small, just like those old hotels. Walls are incredibly thin. I heard my neighbors alarms, showers and even snoring. Wireless is a plus. Didnt try the nice looking but expensive resturant or the number 1 in San Fran club on the top floor, but heard some negative reviews from people in the elevator on the way down. Keep in mind I was there midweek so maybe it picks up on weekends. Location is great, near union plaza, a few blocks from the BART. Great food choices close by but you will walk a couple of those steep San Fran blocks. I wasnt looking for fancy places just local type dinning and found Lori's and the Pizza place just north of the hotel to be great places for a leisurely dinner. Would stay here again but only as a 2nd or 3rd choice. Beware of panhandlers. The walk from the BART during the day and evening was filled with homeless and panhandlers. TONS! About 5 each block. Be careful.

<Content>1st time and not the last time This was our first visit to the Kimptons Sir Francis Drake and on our arrival the parking was a bit mad outside the hotel front but Beefeater doorman was very helpful with the valet parking.The hotel it very clean and well presented. The room we had was a tad small but very well looked after by the Housekeeping staff. Location is great, with the ideal shopping places just around the corner.If we come back to San Francisco we will be staying at the Francis Drake!Thanks for a great stay.

<Content>Decent My husband and I stayed here at the last leg of our honeymoon trip. The location is very convenient b/c it is right at union square and by the cable car stop. The rooms are very very small and of course expensive because it is San Francisco so I guess that is to be expected. The cable in our room was not very good and had very limited channels. We did not spend a ton of time in the room but it is always nice to unwind and watch something but not here. Our room was always clean but overall our stay was very average.

<Content>Great Hotel; Great Location Stayed here for three nights in April with four friends - it was a great experience. Check-in was efficient and we were allowed to go straight to our rooms despite arriving well before the 3.00pm check-in time. I loved the reception area and lobby - it was very grandiose! The twin double room was spacious, clean and the beds were really comfortable. We had a great view of Union Square and Macy's. I loved the Aveda products in the bathroom and dressing gowns (one in tiger skin print, the other in zebra skin print!) were an added bonus! The hotel is in a superb location - lots of great diners (try Roxy's just up the street from the hotel), restaurants (try EO Trading Company around the corner), bars and caf茅s within 5 minutes walk; Chinatown 5 minutes walk and right beside Union Square and great shopping! Also, the cable car ($5 per ride) stops right outside the hotel and brings you out to all that is Fisherman's Wharf. We also spent two of our nights in the hotel's top floor bar - Harry Denton's Starlight Room - this has spectacular night time views of San Fran, a comprehensive cocktail menu, excellent service, live music, hopping DJs, a busy dancefloor and a great atmosphere. I hope to go back to SF and would absolutley definitely stay here again - I have already recommended it to family and friends intending to travel to SF and all of the above for a fantastic price!

<Content>Can't wait to go back! We stayed last week for the first few days of our honeymoon and it was PERFECT! We traveled on to Napa after San Fran and I really did not want to leave the Sir Francis Drake!!!! Our King room was on a corner overlooking Union Square. It was incredibly clean, bright, and beautifully decorated.The staff knew it was our honeymoon and left a bottle of chilled champagne and a voucher for free drinks in our room while we were at dinner our first night. :-)I would like to compliment the staff as well, they were very enthusiastic and kind. Not stuffy at all just real people that value customer service. We had a fantastic time at the Sir Francis Drake, I will happily recommend it and look forward to going back soon!

<Content>Great Stay My wife and I stayed for 2 nights April 15th  19th. and were very impressed by the service and attention we rec'd from the professional staff, front desk, bellmen everyone. The location is perfect right off Union Sqr. I think we must have rec'd an upgrade as we found our rooms to be very spacious and had none of the problems some of the previous posters had mentioned. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a great experience in San Fran.Thanks to the staff at The Drake for a wonderful stay.....

<Content>Great Stay at the S.F.Drake - Kimpton Scores Again Ok. The windows are, indeed, filthy. I mean really, truly filthy on the outside. I will take on faith the explanation given earlier here on T.A. and not count it... but if I hadn't read it here first, it would have been a total turn-off when I arrived.... Having said that, we had a fantastic weekend stay here. First of all, the staff was very friendly and helpful. They helped us with directions, etc. etc. Always with a smile. They have done a nice job of redoing the rooms. The usual Kimpton tasteful decor. Ours was in the tower, with 2 double beds. We slept like babies. Perhaps because it is an older hotel, we heard no noise from neighbors at all. We were fairly close to the elevators and were worried, but it was never an issue. The bathroom was very small, but that's an old hotel for you. This is not a bathroom that can handle 2 people at the same time... but everything was clean and well maintained. They left more than enough towels... something I appreciate. The beds were great. Very firm. Just right for us. The sheets were wonderful. The top spread was covered top and bottom with clean white sheets. I love that. They are currently having a special for Hybrid cars. Vallet parking is FREE. That saved us, with tax, $100.00 for our 2 night stay... (typical downtown rate of $44.00 a night.) Lucky us! This hotel is the perfect location for shopping, theater, and exploring San Francisco. On top of it all, they accept dogs with no added (bogus) cleaning fee. It was the perfect hotel for a perfect weekend in San Francisco. I wouldn't want them to change a thing. (well.... ok... except the windows....)

<Content>Great Location, Friendly Staff, Excellent Stay The Sir Francis Drake is perfectly located, in a nice neighborhood, with access to many types of public transportation. The staff is attentive, approachable, and friendly. The rooms are lovely . Very nicely decorated with comfortable beds. The bathrooms are a little small but what they lack in size they make up for in charm.One area for improvment is the temperature in the hotel lobby bar. The automatic doors constantly open and close, letting the wind into the space. It must be very difficult to heat (w/the high ceilings) but perhaps hanging a velvet curtain would help block out the wind.All around, though, a great stay. Thank You!

<Content>The Drake is Great! I have read through the reviews of this hotel before writing mine and want to clarify a few things based on my stay. First, this is a boutique historic hotel. When we arrived we heard another guest complaining about the size of her room, and I want to say what did you expect? If you want a big boxy standard room, go to the Sheraton. This is why you stay at a place like the Drake, because the quirlky small rooms are charming! We had a king bed (luxurious) in a smaller sized room right near the elevator on the 12th floor. Because this is an old building we couldn't hear a thing outside our door. Not a problem at all with noise. The bedding was very high quality, definitely Kimpton standard. The decor in the room was also great - mismatching striped wallpaper and headboard - also a great quirky feature of a boutique hotel. And yes, the bath was small. Over three days I think we probably spent a total of 30 minutes in the bathroom - does the size really matter? The best part of this hotel is its location in Union Square on the cable car line. You really feel like you in the middle of it all, and it is a great starting point for getting all over the CIty (right near the Bart, Muni, Cable Car, etc.) Also, the dining in this neighborhood is fabulous. Our best restaurant experience was at a Mexican place (Colibri) recommended by the Concierge! We booked on Expedia and got a great three day mid-week rate of $100 a night. The ONLY complaint I have about the Drake is the heating/cooling system (apparently new) in the room. Our thermostat was inoperable and the room hovered between 75 and 80 degrees the whole time we were there. We called to complain twice and either had no response or the fix didn't work (we were out when they came). Because we are from Seattle, I think we were pretty ok with a warm room in spring, but it was mildly annoying. I would definitely recommend this hotel for the value. Definitely above average.

<Content>Quaint hotel, great locaton Loved this charming hotel! I'm a native San Franciscan now living in Las Vegas AND a travel agent for the last 10 years. This was the first time I have done the touristy thing in my own hometown as I was a tour guide for about 10 of my friends who have never been to the Bay area.The Sir Francis Drake is a landmark, perfect location to everythng.Service was great, rooms were nicely decorated- it was definitely a lovely hotel.Keep in mind that San Francisco is an old city with OLD buildings, most of the hotels downtown will be a little used and abused, however, they all do try to renovate to give clients nicer amenities without losing the old-fashioned feel of how San Francisco is supposed to be. Old Victorians, one way streets, rolling hills and old world charm- I never thought I would appreciate the history and architecture of San Francisco until I did not live here anymore...The Sir Francis Drake is the pefect embodiment of what Old San Francisco is supposed to be.I would stay here again and woud definitely recommend to my clients looking for a boutique hotel in San Francisco.

<Content>Avoid unless your goal is a sub standard experince The Drake has a number of problems. To start it's very dated and smells very musty. The rooms were below average, peeling wall paper, broken A/C, dirty windows, dirty carpet, saggy matresses, and realitively rude staff. If interested, I would totally avoid this hotel. For the money I suspose it's worth it but if your paying $140 or more there are a ton of better hotels in the San Fran area. I've been visiting San Fran for over 20 years on business. I have stayed at them all and enjoy the experience of new hotels while there. However, the Drake was an absolute nightmare. AVOID my friends.

<Content>Good value. Great lobby. Fabulous location. Our family of five just spent three nights at the Drake. Although I was a bit concerned after reading TA reviews, I booked it anyway because the price was right. We had a king room on the 14th floor with two double beds, a pull out couch and a roll away for $248 including parking. This was very reasonable given the stellar location just off of Union Square and right on a cable car line. In addition, many of the other hotels I contacted would not allow a roll away to be added. At other hotels, we would have needed two separate rooms. In general, we were very happy with the room. We mostly appreciated the pillows. They were feather but not overstuffed like most. The mattresses were very comfortable. The room was still spacious even with the extra beds and very clean. The bedding, headboards, wallpaper and curtains are all new. The rest of the furniture was slightly worn but nothing horrible. Our only complaint was that we had difficulty regulating the room temperature. It was a bit warm so we just opened a window. We did not mention this to the front desk until checkout. It seems they have a new heating/cooling system and are still working out the kinks.If you like old, grand hotels, this is for you. The lobby is beautiful and ornate. However, the hotel is not fully renovated. Be preared for clean but dingy hallways once you get off the elevator. I asked the manager about future plans. They are upgrading their fitness center, then replacing windows and then renovating the hallways. On the plus side, the hotel restaurant, Scala, has great ambience and is excellent for dinner or a late night snack. We ate there twice. There is a Borders and a drug store (where you can buy multi day City Passes) just across the street. The cable car is right out front.The staff was very friendly and interested in our satisfaction with the exception of one of the doormen in Beefeater attire who was clearly dissinterested in answering our questions. In summary, we would definitely stay here again if the prices remain unchanged.

<Content>Nice, centrally located hotel The Sir Francis Drake is one of SF's 'grande dames' of hotels, which you can see by their lobby and their central location near Union Square. It also means that the hotel (particularly the hallways) is somewhat structurally outdated but the Kimpton group did a nice job renovating the rooms, incl. Aveda products and wifi-throughout the hotel. The service was very friendly. You should definitely check out the Starlight room on top for a drink with a view, and the close-by 'Crepe o Chocolat'-bistro for homemade organic foods (75 O'Farrel Street, one bloc south of Union Square)!

<Content>Loved the Sir Francis Drake! The SF Drake was wonderful! Its location cannot be beat for getting around the city and jumping on the cable car or walking over to Market St. to catch the new trains or over to Sutter for a bus. It is walking distance to many sights: Union Square shops, Yerba Buena Gardens and MOMA, the SF Center (now called Westfield) and of course, Chinatown. Our room was moderate in size...2 queen beds and a small bathroom, but was recently renovated and was clean and had a nice, stylish decor. I agree with what some have said about the windows...you really cannot see out of them because they are so dirty, but we were not in our rooms for much of the time and the view was not all that important to us. What we loved was the ambiance of the hotel...a charming, lovingly restored property that has a very friendly staff and provided all the ammenities we could have asked for. We traveled with our 2 young children and they loved the Beefeaters who stand guard the hotel and are happy to help or pose for photos. The lobby has a nice bar for meeting friends and having a drink. The hotel has an elegant feel without being too pretentious...it was comfortable and inviting. And, without doubt, the best location for getting around the Beautiful City by the Bay!!

<Content>Worth staying if you're visiting San Fran Enjoyed our time at the hotel. Good location, nice rooms, friendly service.They only thing I didn't like was that they could have a room for us at 2:30 PM for an early check-in but we just passed the time for 30 minutes getting a drink at the bar and the bartender was friendly.Will stay again at this hotel if we're in the area.Good to see that they had a LCD TV in our room.

<Content>Great Location! Definitelly "Historic" I have stayed at Kimpton hotels before so I thought Sir Francis Drake would be another name on my list of great stays. While I thought the location was wonderful, there were a few things to be desired. The porters were extremely helpful and friendly as well as the doormen. The great service stopped there. We wanted to attend the Sunday's a Drag event at the Starlight Lounge, but the concierge was unwilling to help us book a table. Instead of answering questions she told us to look in the guide in our room and call ourselves. We called the hotel befor we arrived to inquire about transportation from the airport. We were basically told to check online and figure it out.The rooms were very cute. I love the decorative style of the Kimpton brand. Our room looked as though there had been some water damage on one of the walls adjoining the bathroom that had been repaired, but not very well. The wall was bubbling out and was squishy. The free wireless internet was great. It made it easy for us to look up things to do and see. The hotel bar was beautiful and the drinks were great. The maid service was great, our room was cleaned very well. I love the doormens outfits and cheery disposition. I also noticed the dirty windows, but had read responses by the management about the reasoning. We spent little time in our room so that didnt bother me. Overall I thought that the hotel was beautiful. I just wish the service had been a little better.

<Content>Only worth it if the sleeping room rate is severly discounted Paid $169 p/night -- booked online through travel wholesaler (Expedia). It's an old hotel so some latitude needs to be extended in certain areas. We specifically asked for a room away from the elevator and we were placed RIGHT NEXT to the elevator in what was little more than a converted closet. Still, it is hardly the value I was seeking. Small cramped room, miniature bathroom but I nice big closet. Good thing as there was nowhere to put any clothes; too bad that I had to turn on all the lights in the bathroom and the near the bed to see anything inside the closet.the hotel has had an upgrade to the HVAC system but hasn't bothered to remove the air conditioner from the window.The hotel rooftop also opens itself up for Wednesday night clubs so getting to your sleeping room is like accessing the Pentagon. The queue line is supposed to make the hotel guests feel like they are prioritized but it just makes it all the more ordinary. One more inconvenience in a city where choices are plentiful and the desire to ever return to the Sir Francis Drake becomes non-existent.Too bad that they cannot capitalize on their history in a manner that would make a guest want to return.

<Content>Just OIK I'm done with historic hotels. That means old, with problems.THE BAD: The rooms are small and the bathroom is pathetically small (4 x 5 not including the tub). No room to put anything. If I was by myself, maybe I wouldn't have cared as much, but I wasn't there alone. Everyone has their thing. I would not stay here again because of room/bathroom size. The bathrooms are newly tiled, though.I called engineering for clogged toilet. It wasn't clogged; just old -need to hold the handle down 5-10 seconds to flush properly.If someone takes a shower in the room next to you, it couldn't be louder. The starlight room charges hotels guests a $15 cover to stand at the bar. All the chairs are taken away we were told, to allow more people to order drinks without obstruction. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???THE GOOD: The good is what many other hotels in Union Square have - location and service - I can get a better room and deal in many other hotels.

<Content>Generally pleasant experience; good value for the money My husband and I were in San Francisco to visit relatives and stayed for 3 nights at the Sir Francis Drake. At $99/night, I can't rate too harshly. The hotel pretty much met our expectations - somewhat old and faded, but offering a decent standard of accommodation and service.The man at check-in was very nice and gave us a triple upgrade in room class. So goodness knows what were were supposed to get for our $99. We ended up with a corner room on the 16th floor that had something of a city view, although it was mostly blocked by the 'utility terrace' outside the windows. (There were satellite dishes, cables, tarps, etc on this 'terrace' - more on that later).The room had been pretty recently renovated, not using the finest materials and craftsmanship, but well enough to make it cheerful. The bed was comfortable and we were happy with the room temperature. The bathroom was modern but tiny. We had a tub and shower, no problems with water pressure, although we did have trouble with a broken sink stopper. Our biggest complaint was the windows. They are old and we were in San Francisco on a rainy and windy weekend. The windows rattled all night long, and the tarps on the 'terrace' outside our room blew like flags unfurling all night long. We live in Manhattan, in a prewar apartment overlooking a major avenue, and this was the noisiest night we've ever spent. The windows definitely need to be replaced!We didn't spend much time at the hotel, but the staff members we interacted with were friendly and competent. For $99/night, I definitely feel we got our money's worth.

<Content>Lame excuses and system failures Stayed at the Sir Francis Drake for two nights last week. I have used several other Kimpton hotels, and they have all been very enjoyable stays, so my expectations were reasonably high when we checked in.After two nights at this hotel, I can only say that this hotel must be the exception to the Kimpton brand of hotels and their excellent service and ambience overall. When we entered our room, we could not see through the window, neither could we shut it properly. It looked as if the window had not been cleaned since the hotel opened for business in the 1920's. When I told the front desk about this, they claimed that the hotel is undergoing renovations and therefore the windows are dirty. In addition, the windows had been recently cleaned (!), and were due to be replaced soon. Pardon my ignorance, but there was absolutely no information on this in my room, and there was nothing to indicate ongoing renovations.Another thing that irritated me is that the front desk failed to wake-up me at 6 am, although we had asked for this specifically, since we were catching an early flight. The front desk feed-back was: Yes, your request is in our system, but the framework does not work. I asked again, and was told that in plain English, the internal hotel system for wake-up calls was not working. Lucky for us, I woke up a few minutes before 6 o'clock and we made it to the airport in time.Finally, I used the business centre to access the Internet. The exorbitant rate of 23.80 USD per hour is very steep in my view, particulalrly since the two computers I used did not work. I was still being charged the full price. When I asked an agent at the front desk, I was told that the computers are managed by a third party, and guess what, I had experienced another system failure.In conclusion, I think Kimpton is a great hotel chain, and this particular hotel has an unbeatable location. That being said, I would strongly suggest to stay clear of this hotel. To be fair, we were offered a 15 % discount, but I still left the hotel with a bad taste in my mouth.

<Content>Dusty old glory If you want to live the legend, leave it to the imagination. The hotel is dusty, old and nothing special. They did a fast and cheap renovation in 2007, you can totaly see the unrefined job. The concierge had no clue about concerts or events in town, he had to check everything on line while I was standing waiting..I could do it by myself!

<Content>Stylish -- almost luxurious We chose the Sir Francis Drake as an alternative to staying home during a neighbor's all-night party, so all we really needed was a quiet, comfortable place to sleep where we could also bring our dogs. The room was stylish, although certainly not luxurious. Even though we chose a Tower Queen room (an upgrade from Queen Petite and Queen Standard) our room was on the small side. There was plenty of room to move around, and even a large desk, but one side of the bed was up against the wall (no end table). The bathroom was well-appointed but truly tiny -- you basically have to sit at an angle on the toilet to keep from impaling yourself on the TP holder -- although at least we had a tub/shower (most room categories apparently don't). It felt like a NYC hotel bathroom.It took more than an hour, two phone calls, and a visit to the lobby to finally get a dog bed and bowls to use during our stay -- which we were offered when we checked in. None of the employees seemed to know where they were, or who to ask. Kimpton hotels pride themselves on being pet-friendly, I would have expected better. We were exhausted and just wanted to get to sleep, but we were unable to do so because we had to wait up for the bellman to bring these items.If you're travelling with pets -- who might be over-excited by the noise and festivity of the lobby bar on Friday night -- you can enter off the Sutter Street side of the building and take the elevator from the lower lobby straight up to your room.

<Content>Good Location, so so rooms This hotel is just nice compared to many of the hotels in the San Fransico area. The doorman thing is pretty cool. There is a bar at the entry -way but in the cold months it can be really chilly sitting there. The rooms are only ok. They need some major updating, especially the windows, they were so old and nasty, I thought I would get lead poisoning just by looking out them. The decor was ok. This is a great location for sightseeing, close to everything. The staff was really nice.

<Content>Fantastic location, great service My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in January and were very pleased. We arrived early Friday (11:30am), so our room wasn't quite ready, but by the time we grabbed some lunch and came back we were able to check in. The staff was very courteous and helpful. Requests for a heating pad and extra pillows were answered within 5 minutes. The room was clean and cozy, and plenty big enough for the two of us. The bathroom needs additional shelving space to put toiletries since the vanity is small. It would have been nice to unpack those items rather than have to keep them in the beside drawer. The bed was comfortable, and the shower head was great for tall people. We never had to wait more than a few minutes for the elevators. One quibble is we were not able to get the room cool enough for our liking while sleeping. It would only go down to 66 degrees, and I am not sure that it really was that cool in the room. We would have opened the windows while we slept to get it a bit cooler, but there are not screens and I didn't want a stray bird wandering in. For most people, not getting the room cool enough in January is probably not a concern.The location is terrrific. We bought a 7-day Muni pass for $24 and did not need to rent a car. The cable car stop is right outside the front door, or, it is a short walk to Market street to catch a trolley car or bus. The location of the hotel is by far the biggest asset. There is so much shopping, dining, and activity all around. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to San Francisco.

<Content>Great Location. Stayed here for two nights. The hotels location was ideal. I flew into SFO and took the BART straight to the Powell station which is located in union square, then walked 5 minutes to the hotel. The hotel staff was very accommodating. We did have one incident, the sheets on our first night weren't in the cleanest condition we called the front desk and they delivered some clean sheets. Overall i enjoyed my stay at the Drake.

<Content>Hip Hotel - Postive Experience I stayed here only one night for business, but it was a memorable stay. Perfect location near great shopping and restaurants. Very helpful staff. Smallish, but super comfortable room. The bed linens and comforters were do die for. Super quiet. I slept like a baby.

<Content>The Drake Was Wonderful Again My wife and I stayed in January at the Drake for the second time in four months, and our stay was again wonderful. Comfortable room, fantastic location, friendly and helpful staff; one could not ask for more. We walked to and ate in great restaurants. The best stores for shopping are all around you. We are looking forward to returning to San Francisco and the Drake soon.

<Content>Great Stay My Boyfriend and I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake at the end of November. We got a great great deal on this room. It's location is perfect. The cable car stops literally in front of the hotel and can take you all the way down to Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel room was small (but we didn't feel like that was an issue because we were out sight seeing the entire day). The room was decorated cute and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel entrance is very nice and they have a small cafe connected where we ate breakfast and lunch a few times. We found the hotel staff to be very nice. Overall I would stay here again, like I said, it's a great location. Right in the shopping district.

<Content>Location, Location, Location Great location. Highly recommend staying in Union Square as opposed to Fisherman's Warf. It only took us a couple hours to be bored and done with Fisherman's Warf. This hotel was a great location. It is a little noisy (and we were on the far side from the trolleys on the 11th floor). However, we actually enjoyed the street noise and trolley bells as it added to the feel of being in San Francisco. The room is small, but we went with the deluxe room and it was well worth the money. Most importantly, the room and hotel were clean and in nice condition and the bed was comfortable. I would recommend this hotel. A tip to save some money - park in the sutter-stockton garage (in the quad between sutter, stockton, bush and grant streets). In is a short block and a half walk and saves considerable money compared to the valet only offered by the hotel.

<Content>Poor/Rude Service We did not stay in the hotel, fortunatly. My family and I left Saks, 8:00, when the store closed. We arrived at the resturant around 8:15 and waited about 15-20 minutes for a drink. While in the bar we were accosted by a begger from the street. (We should of known then)-when I mentioned it to the staff they ignored me. The wait was not unusual-given the time of year and no reservations. We were seated in the wine room. Very nice. It took our waiter another 20 minutes to even awknoledge us-we had to ask for bread twice. That should be automatic. The waiter was very abrupt and rude. Finally at 10:30 we got our bill for pizza!! A chef from the kitchen spent 80% of his time in the restuant visiting with friends. If the kitchen was that busy, why was he not cooking.I found the staff rude, aburpt and I would RUN-NOT-WALK as fast as I could from this terriable establishment. I am so glad we did not have to spend the night there.Holly Moeri

<Content>Great hotel I can't understand all the negative reviews for this hotel. Yes, it's not in perfect condition but you're also not paying $400 a night like you would be at some of the higher end hotels in San Francisco. Through their web-site, I was able to get a room for $134 per night. I thought the staff were very accommodating, friendly, and willing to assist where ever they could to make sure our stay was pleasant. We stayed in a room with two queen size beds on the 5th floor. The sound proofing was excellent for being in the heart of the city. I didn't hear any noise coming from any of the nearby rooms and the hotel was totally booked. The location is stellar. You are right in Union Square. The bathroom was very small but typical of a bathroom in a busy city such as San Francisco. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>accentuate the positives... My partner and I had the opportunity to stay at the Sir Francis Drake just after Christmas for three nights, where we were joined by my mother-in-law. The hotel is conveniently situated in the heart of Union Square, next to all the fantastic shopping that surrounds it. The hotel is charming from the beefeaters at the door, to the grand foyer and lobby. It is out of a different era.We had booked an Executive King for ourselves (room 925)and a regular Queen for the mother-in-law. Upon check-in, I was pleasantly surprised to see how big our room was. I believe that two rooms had merged to create a larger suite. The interior designers have had a lot of fun decorating the rooms. They are very unusual and kitschy, but at the same time stylish. Our room had a couch and chair, desk, king bed, bar fridge, tv, etc... all the usual touches. The only thing missing was an in-room safe and coffee maker.The bathroom was large with both a shower stall and a tub, but had a small vanity which made it hard to place all our bath products. The hotel supplies Aveda products so the quality was high. The bathroom decor fit the period style of the hotel, but was recently updated. There were a couple of problems with our room... the biggest being its location. All the executive kings face Powell Street, which you will soon find out to be a bustling thoroughfare that is busy from morning to midnight. The clang clang clang of the trollies and other street noise will most likely keep some guests up at night. (they offer earplugs at the front desk, which I took advantage of.) I wouldn't recommend this side of the hotel for people who can't handle street noise. And there are other noises beyond that... early morning garbage trucks... and drunks leaving the Starlight Room... One minor problem was the dirty windows in our room that you could hardly see out of... I am not kidding... it looked like years of dirt and dust... the windows in this room were still single pane, so this might be a reason for the noise, too.My favorite part about the room was the bed... It is very comfortable.My mother-in-law had a much smaller room on the back side of the building... and it seemed much quieter. This room was small by anyone's standards... with one of the most claustrophobic bathrooms I have ever seen. I kid you not, but you almost have to sit on the toilet to brush your teeth or do your makeup. You might have two square feet of leg room. I wouldn't recommend the queen room for more than one person... and never for a big person... There is no room to move.All in all we had a good stay. I would recommend making sure you get the right room for yourself. The executive king was great but there was the noise factor... I wouldn't want the smaller room. But if all you want is a good comfortable bed, then go for it. The SFD's location can't be beat, with everything at your doorstep and the staff is friendly.I would recommend this hotel, but with a few caveats... but I would stay here again if the price was right. I have stayed at other Kimpton hotels in the past and this one seems just a step below... but the hotel has a certain grandeur to it that you won't get in a boutique hotel. I would have given it four stars had it not been for the noise...

<Content>Nice stay at the Drake We stayed at the Drake 12/29-1/1/08. The location is wonderful. We took the Bart train over from the Oakland airport and the Bart station was just down the hill. The cable car to Fisherman's Wharf stops right in front of the hotel. If you come to shop Union Square is where you want to stay. The room was clean and the bed was the best hotel bed I have ever slept in. We arrived early and our room was ready. There were 6 elevators and they moved quickly. The only bad things I can think of were the limited TV channels and the dirty window. We will stay at the Drake on our next visit.

<Content>Sir Francis Drake is fantastic... The Sir Francis Drake is fantastic... especially for the price. The rooms are very nice - not huge, but very nice. The staff is excellent and the common areas are beautiful. Parking is pricey... once you are in the city, you don't really need a car - leave it at home if you can. You can't go wrong at the Drake.

<Content>Overall, positive experience I just spent 1 night at the Drake with my mother and my 8-year-old daughter. I got a very good rate, although valet parking will add another $50/night to the cost.There were a few minor snags with our stay. It was quite busy in front of the hotel when we pulled up, and it took several minutes to get the attention of someone to help with the car. We removed our luggage ourselves. Our room wasn't ready, which was no big deal because it was only 11 am, several hours before check-in time. We stowed our luggage and went off into the city. When we returned several hours later and checked in, it took a really long time--over half an hour--for someone to bring our luggage up. And even though I'm a Kimpton In-Touch member (which was acknowledged when we checked in) there was no welcome amenity in the room. So I called down and they did bring one later.The good points outweighed the bad. The staff were all very friendly, and someone called the room about 6:30pm just to make sure everything was okay. The lobby is spectacular. The room itself, a queen-queen tower room, was clean and nicely decorated and had a great view (though the outside of the windows badly need washing!). The beds were very comfortable and the room itself quiet. And the location is fabulous. Union square is right down the block, and Chinatown and several museums are within easy walking distance. If you want to wander farther afield in the city, public transportation is easy to get to. And what could beat lying in your bed on a foggy night and listening to the cable cars clanging 17 floors beneath you?

<Content>Loved It! I loved the Sir Francis Drake and unlike many of the reviews did not experience any negatives with the room. The lobby and public areas are gorgeous and the room was comfortable, decorated with a modern deco flair and the bed was heavenly. The staff was very very friendly and helpful and the neighborhood is of course incredibly convenient to everything - Union Square, public transit, etc. I highly recommend a stay here - we had a King tower room and think that if you try one of these you will not be disappointed!

<Content>Great hotel; great location My husband and I stayed at the Sir Frances Drake Hotel for two nights just before Christmas to celebrate my birthday, and had a very enjoyable visit. This was my first time staying at the hotel. our room was a King Delux, and while the room was not huge, it was plenty big enough for us with stylish decorations and good quality bed linens. The bathroom was a good size and the Aveda products were a nice touch. The hotel is in a lovely old building with a grand lobby with lots of character. But what really made our stay special was the staff. Everybody from the Beef Eaters and the bell boys to the front desk was friendly and helpful. When we arrived the bell boy helping me with our luggage told me to ask at the desk for Macy's coupons before going shopping. We called room service for robes and they were at the door almost immediately. When we went to the fabulous Starlight Room for a cocktail the host was exceptionally nice and made us feel both welcome and special, and because we told him we had dinner reservations elsewhere he made sure that our server was aware that we had a time constraint. Kudos to whoever is responsible for staff training.I have stayed at far more expensive hotels in this country and abroad, but rarely have had such consistently good service. I will definitely stay at the Sir Frances Drake again.

<Content>Okay, but not as promised. I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake December 14 -16. I was advised of a $99.00 promo rate on Travelzoo, and was directed to the Kimpton Hotels website to book the room. Because the promo rate didn't come up on the Kimpton website, instead showing a $119 rate as the promo rate, I called a reservationist on the toll free number and was told that the $99 rate was sold out. However, the reservationist told me that the $119 rate (also a promo rate) was for an upgraded deluxe room on a higher floor in the tower section of the hotel. When I checked in, I was given a room on the 9th floor -- not a higher floor. The room had to be a standard room. It certainly was not deluxe. Although the hotel staff were pleasant, it was difficult to get the concierge to answer when dialing from the room. Additionally, the bathroom was tiny as was the closet. The wallpaper, though stylish, was peeling from the wall in places. The window -- the outside at least -- was so dirty that it was difficult to see through the dirt. All of the above aside, the hotel is very well located and a great example of 1920s hotel architecture. Also, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable.

<Content>Perfect Location! This hotel was in the the Union Square area. It was in the perfect location for both sightseeing and shopping. The cable car route has a stop directly in front of the hotel - just walk outside and hop on the cable car to get down to Fisherman's Wharf. This is a historic hotel so the room (King Deluxe) was small - very much like European hotel rooms but it was very comfortable. I had a corner room that looked out over Union Square and the holiday decorations were beautiful to watch. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. I would definitely stay here again!!

<Content>Great Location, Nice Amenities A friend and I came to SF to do some shopping and to see all the holiday decorations around Union Square. It was great just walking around, it was so pretty at night with all the trees and lights! The hotel's location is very ideal, as it's basically right next to Union Square. The decor of the lobby is beautiful. We got a Queen Petite Room and the name of it is spot on. It's fairly small. We didn't mind since we weren't in the room that much. The room was clean and the Aveda products are a plus.The Starlight Room on the 21st floor is pretty cool for the view and the dancing though a little pricey for drinks. The lobby bar was not crowded like others have posted but it was a Sunday. There's a bartender there that won best bartender in SF I guess. He was nice and seemed to have a local following. I also heard the drag show at the Starlight on Sunday afternoons are fun to see, but we missed it by 1/2 hour.What would make this hotel even better though is if the staff was really friendly. The service was really just okay overall. Check-in was good. but it actually seemed a bother to get help on a couple of occasions with directions, to get our luggage or to get restaurant recommendations. As some of these employees are the first people customers encounter, I would think the hotel would strive for exceptional service out of them.Luckily, the price and location overshadowed the service. We got a great rate for the room. At that price and being so close to Union Square, I think we would definitely stay at the Sir Francis again.

<Content>You Could (Should) Not Ask For More My wife and I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake for three days beginning the Friday after Thanksgiving. We chose the hotel based on: location, price and reviews. What a happy surprise our choice turned out to be! One half block to Union Square for the lighting of a huge Christmas Tree! Just pure luck on our part. Directly on the Powell-Hyde St. cable car, Union Square entertainment, shopping, restaurants, etc.etc.etc. You could throw a rock in any direction and hit more good restaurants than I have ever experienced in New Orleans. Great service. Every question was met with a smile and courtesy. Prompt friendly bell service and free room upgrade. Super decor, restaurant and night club atop the hotel with tremendous views. While waiting for our table at Scala's Bistro, which is in the hotel, the hostess walked out of the restaurant, up the stairs to the lobby, and found us at the bar to tell us our table was ready, all with a smile. Its a great old hotel in the city center; built years ago so expect the bathrooms to be smaller than you would wish for. I said small, not inadequate.Some tips: use public transportation while staying here. You have direct access to cable cars and buses and parking is too expensive. My best tip is to call the Muni phone number any time you want a bus or cable car. They will tell you exactly when and where to stand to catch your transportation and you get a human to talk to. Please take the 9x bus through China Town going to Fisherman's Warf. You really experience China Town that way! Free airport shuttle would make this hotel a 10.

<Content>The Drake is Great! My wife and I did a four day trip to San Francisco to take in a few baseball games and the City. We have been to SF several times and stayed at various places around the city. I found a great rate at the Sir Francis Drake on their web site and reserved a room. Great rate and no money up front. The Drake is a fine classic hotel in the perfect location. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are a bit small, but all have been refurbished and are quite comfortable. Since SF is a great walker town, a right turn out of the front door leads to three straight blocks up, up and up before you start going down, down, down towards Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf. Excellent way to wear off breakfast. For those who want to pass on the walk, the classis cable car line goes right in front of the Drake, so just hop on! The light rail train to the ball park is a short 6-8 blocks away and a great, cheap way to get there. The staff at the Drake arranged for a rental car (Napa Valley trip) that was picked up and returned within 6-8 blocks from the Hotel. Very convenient in a city that is hell to drive in. We both highly recommend the Sir Francis Drake.

<Content>Great Location, Great Room My husband and I just returned from a great (though foggy) weekend in San Francisco. The Drake is located in a perfect location in Union Square. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathrooms are small but for my husband and I it didn't really matter. I did think that if I was staying here on a girl's weekend, we would sure be stepping over each other!! The hotel decor is a lot of fun and definitely unique. The only issue we had was with the Lobby Bar, we tried to get a drink there before dinner both Friday and Saturday nights but it was so busy, we couldn't even get near the bar to order. There were functions both nights, so we just went elsewhere - no big deal. All in all the Drake was great and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

<Content>Drake was fine We stayed at the Drake on Nov 7-9. No issues. Our room was on the 8th floor facing the back. We did not experience a problem with noise (that other posters mentioned). Staff were fine -at check in; luggage delivered prompltly,check out  door man were fine. Bar service was a bit slow on late Friday evening. Elevators were fine when we arrived mid week but slower later in the evening on Friday. Bathroom was very small but it is an old San Fran hotel. Overall it suited us fine. JL, Vancouver,Canada.

<Content>Enjoyed the stay. We stayed at the Drake this past weekend and enjoyed our visit.The room is typical of a room in a older hotel, small and a bit cramped. But the key for me was that the room was clean. We were on a lower floor and the noise from Powell street can be heard late into the night. Soundproofing the windows would be nice. We had one issue with the room and it was handled within 15 minutes. The front desk was curtious and the doormen were helpfull.Overall I enjoyed my visit but next time I will know to ask for a room not facing the street.

<Content>No Customer Service I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake hotel from 4 to 8 November 2007 and checked out yesterday. I am writing this review from Hong Kong airport as I have some time here before catching my next flight. I am coming from San Francisco and was there to attend a confernce and was staying at this hotel. There are few fantastic things about the hotel it's location, build out, old stuff preservation etc. but when it comes to the customer service, it is really horrible. At several occactions, I called someone from the housekeeping but no one ever turned up. At the time of checkout yesterday, I called a bell boy to take my luggage downstairs, I made 3 calls in one hour but no one came up. The lady always said, Sir,I'll send the bell boy right away. after 75 minutes, I walked down and requested to send someone and to emphasise, I repeated my request. I don't creat scene but the bell boy finally arrived after 15 minutes, so it took them 90 minutes to send me a bell boy from my first call and he was not curtious at all rather arrogant. I also requested for the bell boy from the housekeeping staff I saw on the floor, the lady bluntly replied, this is not my job. I think that the Drake staff need some serious training or their Managers should go and spend two nights at Ritz Carlton, anywhere and they'll know what Customer Service is. The Elevators just don't work. Although there are 4 elevators but I never saw working two at the same time. You'll have to wait as long as never for the elevator as I had to use stairs several time to avert my frustration waiting!!!!!Only the location of the hotel is good but the customer service, housekeeping, conceirge is disasterous.I have decided not to stay in this hotel again.

<Content>WHAT A DUMP!- kleenex stuffed in holes in roof! Such a dump. Really horrible. We joked that our feet hung out the door as the room was so small. Elevator situation is a disaster as you wait forever. What renovation????The place is so rundown is isn't even funny. Our shower had a hole in the ceiling with kleenex stuffed in it. Disgusting. The hotel seemed like a firetrap to me. I would never, ever, ever stay there again.

<Content>Very disappointing We just returned home from a 4-day stay at the Drake. We received a special rate and felt it was still not worth it! The rooms are minuscule, walls paper thin, and the amenities non-existent. Street noise (even conversations among pedestrians) was very clear. We will not stay with this brand again.

<Content>A real mixed bag Sir Francis Drake hotel is a difficult one to review for me, as it did some things brilliantly, and some things rather badly.Let's start with the positives. The location is great. The rooms are lovely - very modern and stunningly themed, as you'd expect from a Kimpton hotel. The room service food (served from the Bistro downstairs) was possibly the best ever food I have had delivered to my room - I had a stunning pan-seared salmon fillet one night and a house pasta the next, both amazing. It's rare for me to get excited about room service food, but this was really, really good.Onto the negatives, and this mainly relate to the service: the staff just weren't as accomodating / helpful as they could have been - perhaps they're taking the olde English aristocratic thing a bit too seriously? Upon checking in, we first had an issue where our booking reference wasn't being accepted - and the receptionist rather patronisingly suggested we had the wrong hotel and attempted to direct us to another hotel of a similar name nearby. After insisting that we were in the right place, he checked with a more knowledable colleague who explained to him that the number I was giving him was from some sort of central reservations system, and hooray, our booking was found. Not a great start. Then, despite the fact that our rooms had already been paid for, the receptionist attempted to put a hold on $900 on my credit card, the cost of the rooms (despite the fact a third party had already covered their cost), plus $100 per night incidentals. I explained that I didn't understand why this had to be done, as our the cost of our stay had already been paid for, but his system insisted on doing it that way. Unhappy with him putting $900 on hold on my credit card I eventually just gave a cash deposit of $100 for each night, and we evenutally checked in, after about half an hour.That was the biggest issue, hence my still fairly high rating. We just felt on occasion the hotel staff didn't really make things as easy for us as we'd expect in a hotel of this calibre. That said, the rooms are gorgeous inside, and I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great location with minimal problems A good hotel in the heart of Union Square. Great service and location. The only problem was the street noise! they are currently in the process of upgrading their windows so if you stay here, make sure you request a room that is facing the back of the hotel otherwise you'll be hearing the garbage bins being emptied at 4am every morning. the rooms are pretty tight (we originally had a queen petite room which was so small the closet door wouldn't even open all the way) so go for a queen deluxe. room after a few room switches (because of said noise), we ended up in room 1028 which is a great size. Other than that, the service was fantastic. Rooms are clean and beds are comfy

<Content>Love the Drake! We stayed at the Drake for 4 nights in September. I was slightly worried before we got there because we were due to arrive in the evening after a very long journey from the UK. I was very pleased with what we found. Check in was quick and easy, the room was extremely comfortable and charming, the shower was brilliant. I really can't think of anything to complain about! I'm very suprised there are negative reviews on here, but then they seem to be mainly about individual rooms. Ours was on the 3rd floor and we had no real problems at all. We found the staff to be really friendly and helpful, they booked our tickets to Alcatraz for us and gave us plenty of maps and directions. The location was fantastic. There are shops and restaurants nearby, and right outside you can get the tram down to the pier. I would recommend doing this once, but after that there is a very good bus service which is faster and cheaper. I worked out the bus routes from a map I got from the hotel lobby. We had breakfast once at the caffe espresso directly next door, which was very nice, and also once at Sears across the road (make sure you're hungry!). Over all, I would definitely recommend the Drake to others as a good budget hotel. I'm really glad we stayed there. And I love San Francisco! p.s loved the beefeaters too!

<Content>Great all-around hotel! Like the last poster, we really enjoyed the Sir Francis Drake. The hotel staff was helpful and pleasant, and they even let us check-in early. We had a queen deluxe room, which was a king bed, and had plenty of room for two people. There wasn't much of a view, but the staff told us up front that the Sir Francis Drake isn't a view hotel. The walls are a little thin, but that was the only drawback, and it was minor. Great location in Union Square and on the cable car line.

<Content>Honeymoon The Sir Francis Drake met my expectations from what I read from other reviews. It is an old hotel with a lot of character. It is centrally located in the Union Square area. It is within walking distance of Union Square shpping and attactions. We had a Queen Deluxe room (the bed was a king so we may have had an upgrade). It was reasonably large with a walk-in closet. The room decor was very nice. There was some cracked paint on the ceiling but this did not bother us (it added to the hotel's character). Based on other reviews, I expected this and think cracked paint is pretty common. The rooms were otherwise clean and in good order. The bed was very comfortable.The cable cars stop in front of the hotel but they are often full before they reach this stop. If we were going to the Fisherman's Warf, we would walk to Market street and take a street car. It is much easier to catch cable cars on the return trip. The Starlight Room is a nice nightclub with great city views. Contrary to other information I received, the dress code is now casual, and a jacket and tie are no longer required.

<Content>Good location...that's about it!! We stayed at the Drake from Aug 10-13 and from the moment we checked in, we had a below average stay. First, they screwed up our reservation....we reserved 2 double beds and they gave us a Queen. We complained and they told us that they were overbooked and couldn't do anything about it. When we went to our QUEEN room and it was tiny! The TV wasn't even in front of the bed, it was on the side. The bathroom was so small that it made me sick. We then got a call that we had been moved to a double bed room. This was much better and bigger...yet still small. But it was a huge upgrade from the Queen room. The location is great! Close to shopping and great restaurants! I would recommend Sears across the street for breakfast...it was awesome! The Beefeater doorman is also a nice touch. However we waited for our luggage for close to an hour. I would not recommend this hotel, but I guess it would do if you were in a crunch. We had a special wedding rate so I think the $300/night is way too much for this place. Also, they charge you $44/day to valet your car there. All downtown hotels do this, so I would not recommend renting a car in downtown SF. You can cab or walk it. If we ever go back to SF, we will not be staying at the Drake again.

<Content>Stolen Watch After checking out of my room and realizing 20 minutes later I had left my watch on the nightstand, I immediately called back to the hotel and they guaranteed me no one had been in the room yet and they would get it and put it behind the front desk for me to pick up after my event. Unfotunately, whoever entered the room (which appears to be many people) stole the watch and therefore they claim no one was ever able to find it! Nothing makes me more upset or disappointed when I know that someone is lying and I am out of a piece of jewelry that had alot of meaning to me.

<Content>Great location, historical hotel, but not luxury The Drake鈥檚 high points are its location a 陆 block off Union Square and the historical beauty of the hotel evident in the ornate lobby and dramatic exterior. Check-in was just fine and the staff was polite and professional. But who goes to a hotel to hang out in the lobby? We had a queen corner room on the 18th floor with a gorgeous view of Union Square and the Westin St. Francis. The bed was a comfy pillow top and the smallish bathroom with new porcelain and marble finishes had Aveda products and served its purpose. A large person may find the bathroom a bit cramped. Room served its purpose well in terms of sleeping and bathing accommodations, but found some of the finish work in the newly renovated rooms to be sloppy. You could tell that the interior painting was rushed as the detail work around the old windows and fixtures was sloppy and the carpet was coming up in a few places along the wall. The outside of the windows were incredibly dirty and the hallway to the room was dark and depressing. I suppose that some these flaws could be expected in an old hotel, but the missed details prevent the Drake from being a true place of luxury.

<Content>Great value for the money... I was a bit skeptical about heading to San Francisco... I wanted to be near my conference, but didn't want to spend that much to stay AT that hotel... Plus, I'm a smoker. San Francisco is pretty much a non-smoking city, including most of the hotels. Bummer.Fortunately, my request was honored - the hotel has ONE last floor that is smoking (which one of the front desk guys mentioned they were considering getting rid of it), but I can't tell you how stoked I was to be able to smoke in my room (advice to mgmt of SFD - there is a market for allowing smokers to honestly smoke in their rooms. 99% of the hotels in your city won't let it happen, but personally I will pay more for the privelege. Just a thought).My room was two double beds- I would have prefered a king, but oh well. The bathroom was a bit small but not a big deal. Good use of the space, at least. Large closet, free wifi, free coffee until 6:30am (after which I could buy coffee in the cafe), all-in-all I was very impressed with the hotel, the location and how nice all the staff was. I can't say that I've had any other experiences at all with hotels in this city, but unless they eliminate the smoking floor, I'm certain I'll be back.

<Content>OK but needs major renovation 3rd time at this hotel. Small very clean room, but really dirty windows, so dirty that we could not see through them...no exaggeration! Also windows don't shut because of window mount A/C units, so you get a lot of street noise (they need to remove these units now that they have central A/C). Hotel staff very pleasent and helpful, location very convenient to BART, cable cars, Union Sq., etc. as others have mentioned. Scala's and patisserie on corner also good. Hotel must have been grand 80 years ago, but needs a major overhaul. The infrastucture is really worn out and needs replacement. If you are looking for a resort hotel go to the Mark Hopkins or similar, if you want a convenient place to stay then this hotel is fine. Also, don't let them put you under the Starlite room (21st floor) unless you like disco music. Ask for a floor at least 2 levels below.

<Content>Theft in our room Our son's gameboy and games were stolen from the room on our first day. The hotel was very slow and very accusatory towards us when we wanted to file a claim. Needless to say the claim was denied, although they did acknowledge the fact that the entire staff had been replaced for a few hours on that day for a general staff meeting! Jennifer B from NY

<Content>New room renovation is GRRReat! My wife and I needed a night in city this past weekend and the Sir Francis Drake was a perfect getaway. Located 1/2 block from Union Square the SFD is in the middle of SF's best restaurant and shopping. Check-in was a breeze and within 5 minutes we were in the room. With limited availability the only room remaining was a deluxe queen, which normally could dissappoint, but with new bedding, plasma TV and a view of Union Square it was tough to keep the smile off our faces. The bed was excellent, room was clean and offered plenty of space. I'd recommend any travelers looking to stay in the heart of the action to stay here. We will be back.Tip: Starlight Room is a great bar at the hotel but could be loud if you are staying on 20th floor. If staying on a weekend be sure to finish out the night dancing at the Starlight room or request a room on a lower floor if going to bed early.

<Content>The Drake The hotel was in a great location,very central to shopping sightseeing and restaurants. The public rooms are beautiful,and our hotel room was very nice with a good view but very small.The key card stated that complimentary wine was served in the evening and morning tea and coffee was available,on enquiry I was informed that the wine was discontinued and that the morning tea/coffee was available between 5 and 6 am only! As there were no facilities in the room I found this disappointing.all in all though I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Sir Francis Drake not St. Francis My husband thought he booked us in the St. Francis (Westin) that is in the same neighborhood. The location of the Sir Francis Drake is its biggest asset I concur with what others have said--unusual sort of medieval decor--our young adult children said their room reminded them of Alice in Wonderland. Cheery decor, no. We walked to Union Square and always found a cab right outside the door. Beds, linens, bathroom soaps, very nice quality. Front desk staff was very accommodating.

<Content>Elegant all the way! This hotel is located right in the middle of union square. When you walk in, the lobby is absolutely breathtaking!! This hotel has the sophistication of old San Francisco. A bit pricey, considering how much you have to pay for valet packing, but we loved our stay here, and will definitely come back again on our next visit.

<Content>WOW! Wow! This hotel was amazing. It may be in need of some renovations but it was clean and comfortable. I enjoyed everything about my stay here. Uylessus at the front desk was amazing!!! If you are wondering where to eat ask him... he will send you to some amazing resturants that aren't over-run by tourists! Just don't plan on using the concierge for anything... only once during our entire stay did I even see someone at the desk. Overall, this was an extremely cost effective place, close to everything, and was very pleased!

<Content>Great hotel, great location, disappointing service For the price and location, the Sir Francis Drake was probably the best value I've had at a hotel. It is steps from the Powell Street BART station, the cable cars and bus routes. It is also right at Union Square and surrounded by great shops and restaurants. The rooms are small, but keep in mind it is a major metropolitan city, and the rooms are usually small to accommodate all the people staying. While small, they were not uncomfortable in any way and were kept very clean. The only downfalls we experienced were small inconveniences from poor service. Hotels that master the art of the little things are always the best. This hotel is still working on mastering the little things. For instance, we had three people in the rooms and were there for 5 nights. On only one occasion were there three sets of towels. We had to call every time and they would bring giant stacks of towels. Unnecessary. They would also take the drinking glasses and not replace them. And we also received a bit of condescension when we left our boarding pass information they promised to book as the flight opened to get the A passes. We called 20 minutes to remind and it had not been done and we ended up getting stuck in a different boarding group. While some of the service issues were frustrating, it all comes out in the wash with a charming hotel with great period details and a perfect location and reasonable price.

<Content>Downtown special The Sir Frances Drake Hotel on Powell St. in downtown San Francisco was a great find for our stay. We could get where we wanted to go easily and plenty to walk to from there. Staff was accommodating and very helpful. Room was spacious, closet huge and very clean. We had a 15th floor room with a great view. Beds were soft and comfortable. Rate through Expedia was good considering comparing others in the area. I would definitely stay there again on a return trip.

<Content>Great Service! Stayed here for one night on a Saturday. We loved the location - very convenient to walk to everything in San Francisco. Next time I would stay near the Presidio because I loved it, but this is the best location for shopping if you want to be near everything. I loved the Aveda bath products. The room was small, and so was the bathroom, but it is an old downtown hotel and I expected that. Valet parking was $46, but it was that much at all the other hotels I looked at, too. I think it is just a part of being in San Francisco. Hotel was super close to a BART stop, which was great. The concierge and front desk people were the best part of the trip. They gave great directions and recommendations and were very pleasant. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay Stayed for 1 night in a queen size room. First impression of the hotel was nice, liked the lobby. Front desk person was very nice, check in was quick. Room was on the smaller side, but had everything we needed. Bed was very comfy. Bathroom was fine, shower pressure good. We were on the 17th floor, quite quiet actually. We went to a wedding reception that was being held at the hotel. All of the staff seemed very personable. Starlight room was lovely. We got a great price for this hotel so we really enjoyed our time here.

<Content>A nice hotel at an excellent location. If you choose this hotel, you're choosing it mainly for location and somewhat reasonable price. It's right downtown in the heart of the shopping district.The hotel itself is quite grand, but a bit outdated. The rooms are somewhat small, old, and a bit dark. Because the rooms are old, there are more stains on the walls, etc. The rooms are well maintained though and are clean and nicely decorated. The free internet was great. The housekeeping service was prompt and provided nice soaps, shampoos, and lotion. Overall the rooms are nice, the free internet is great, and the location is hard to beat. Our favourite hotel in San Fran is still the Stanford Court. Their customer service is just amazing. The Drake does have a slightly better location though.

<Content>A Terrible Disappointment Let me just start by saying that this was our first trip to San Francisco. My husband and i decided to ditch the East Coast when it came to our vacation this summer and go to Sunny California. I had some expectations of this hotel, but not to many given the fact that i had spoken twice to their Concierge, Ken prior to our arrival and both times he was dismissive and rude. I was trying to arrange some activities prior to our arrival and he told me that i didn`t need to book anything in advance ( never mind the fact that i didn`t want to spend my vacation planning my daily activities, hence i was trying to do it in advance) and when I asked about different tour companies that organized day trips outside of San Francisco, he described one of them and let me know that it was for outdoorsy people( you think?) and he didnt care much for being in the car for 3 hours on the way to the American River. I actually thought about moving our reservation to another hotel, but it was too late.The hotel itself is very old, but it does have a lot of charm. The lobby has somewhat of a feeling of grandeur but the years of neglect can easily be noticed. The check-in was pleasant, the Front Desk interaction being amongst the few pleasurable ones we had while we were there. The room was very small and very contrasting in what the decor and upgrades were concerned ( the Front Desk upgraded us at check-in because our room was not ready- i didn`t want to see the room we were initially in if THIS was an upgrade). The room had new curtains, new headboard ( with some very suspicious stains on it), a large flat screen TV, 1 night stand, 1 desk and chair. The bathroom seemed remodeled ( new vanity and commode) until you pulled back the shower curtain and you saw the old stained, chipped bathtub. Overall cleanliness- OK Anyway, the room was less important because we spent most of the time sightseeing.The Concierge Staff at the hotel was still rude and dismissive during our stay so we tried to stay clear of them and on our departure day we called 4 times to arrange for transportation to the airport, left a Voicemail and never heard back from them. Every time we would call the Hotel Operator to let them know that we were trying to get a hold of the concierge and they kept transferring us to the same extension that we had already called and that nobody answered. We finally went downstairs and we were informed by a patronizing Ken( same one as above ) that arranging airport transportation required for us to be physically present at his desk ( which no one had mentioned during our repeated transfer calls) and that he was extremely busy right as he walked in so he had not yet been able to return our call ( although when we arrived at his desk he was not even there and we had to ask the FD to get his from the back area).The conclusion.... I haven`t stayed at any other hotels in San Francisco but I the next time i`m in SF i will gladly try another one. Sir Francis Drake was not bad, and certainly the physical imperfection could have been overlooked if the staff was spectacular. But...

<Content>BEWARE!!! THIS HOTEL HAS THEFT PROBLEMS!!! The rooms are small and the cleanliness was about average; just about what you'd expect for the price in San Francisco. We were fine with this, until we left our room on the 2nd day and returned to discover that our camera had been stolen. On our way out later that evening, we overheard a member of the hotel staff admonish a bellman because 3 bags had been stolen that day as well. When I reported the the theft to the management, I was told that their insurance company would contact me. Six weeks later, and after about a dozen requests for help, the insurance company told me they were denying my claim. The hotel acknowledged that someone using another key did enter the room that day (not to clean it, though...it was never cleaned that day), but since I couldn't remember exactly what time I returned (it was SIX WEEKS LATER), they wouldn't pay my claim. My advice would be to steer clear of this hotel. There are plenty of other good hotels in the area, and I'm betting their management is a little more careful with their guests' property.

<Content>not worth the cost i dont see why everyone finds this hotel to be so wonderful. first off, the parking is absurd. its $50 a night. and although it is quite convienent to have you car valeted whenever you need it, the cost is ridiculous. my hotel reservation email stated the parking would cost $30 a night, not $50. also, the tv went out for hours at a time and no one came up to help us fix it after a couple phone calls. and the channels suck.the maids knocked on the door every morning at 9am while we were still sleeping, and sometimes even opened the door on us. (there were no 'do not disturb' signs in the room).the room is cute enough with nice decor, but that doesnt make up for the size. you can hardly turn in the bathroom. i just wouldn't recommend this hotel for the price.

<Content>I can't believe the reviews are this bad... Went for a girls night out thing this past weekend and I stayed in a 2-queen room - it overlooked Union Square from one side and the Embarcadero from the other. The beds were incredible, and the furnishings and bathroom were great. Service was excellent, amenities were nice, and they left a little welcome amenity for us. The noise level in the room was good - unlike a lot of San Fran hotels it's nice and quiet at night. Went to the Starlight Room at the top of the hotel and had an absolute blast - live band, luxurious surroundings, but somehow the atmosphere managed to be comfortable and friendly. The worst I can say about this place? Well it's an old hotel and in some instances the halls are narrow. There are some places where the paint on the walls bleeds in to the ceiling. But the good things about this place more than make up for the little detractions. I think the hotel is under new management and has just completed renovations - I think the reason it's rated so low is it was formerly under poor management. All I know is it's one of the best deals on Union Square and it's also really nice - way better than the Hotel Union Square and I'd also say nicer than the Diva, and more whimsical and comfortable than the Park Hyatt, and more personal than the Hilton. Out of those four (which I've stayed at recently), I'd choose the Sir Francis Drake again above everything else - it's the best value.

<Content>Famous Hotel should actually be Infamous Judging by its famous name, I'd booked this hotel for four nights. I was outraged by the fact that the service was not comparable to its reputation. I was given a room that shares the wall with the elevator shaft, and asked to be moved. They promised to move me the next day; however, my request was skipped, and I had to wait an additional day. The rooms are quite small, and one can hardly turn around in the bathroom without bumping into anything. (I stayed in a King Deluxe). Despite this, the location is one of the best in the city.

<Content>Four Days at the Sir Francis Drake Just returned from 4 days with my son's 7/8th grade class at the Sir Francis Drake hotel.It is in a great location for walking to Union Square, the Metreon, Chinatown and the really nice Mall opposite Powell Cablecar/Muni train/Bart Station.The staff is helpful and one evening there was even complimentary wine/nuts in the lobby around 6 pm. The view bar on the top floor was filled with really nicely dressed, really young people and there was 80's disco music playing! We went in for one drink, $10 and a $5 cover charge on a Thursday night!As with all old hotels the rooms are pretty small as are the bathrooms, but the carpet was new, the bed, nice and the linens were very good. Nice puffy duvets; no plastic blankets. You could not open the windows though.The ice machine on my floor did not work, so I had to call the desk every time I wanted ice. The heating/cooling system was a little quirky, but maybe that was because I did not know how to work it! My phone, a cordless, kept losing it's charge so one evening I had to call the desk for my ice on my cell! Someone came right up and fixed it though. Also my mini bar fridge never really got cold.The room was booked through our school;I gave them a check for over $600 for 3 nights, I assume they got a group rate. So I think it's a pretty average deal for the money.All in all I would recommend staying there even though I wish there was a little market nearby. It's close to transportation and the staff is very friendly.

<Content>Close to Everything We stayed two nights at the Sir Francis Drake in April 2007. The hotel is clean and the rooms all have been remodeled. We had a King Deluxe room. The room is small. Fine for two people. The bathrooms are about the size of a half bath/powder room. Very small.The Starlight Room has a cover after 8:00pm. Go early to avoid the $20 fee. The hotel does not offer free passes. Gorgeous views. The hotel is a trolley car stop and they do make a lot of noise.The location is the best in the area!! Next to Saks, Tiffany, tons of stores. Across from Sears Diner. We saw a line of about 100 people outside (Sunday Morning). So, we ate there on Monday (no line)!! Wow!! Great food!! I understand the line!! Try the famous Swedish pancakes. Overall, great location, small bathrooms, good service, and the best pricing!!

<Content>Great Service-Fine Hotel I Just returned from staying at the Sir Francis Drake hotel and it was an excellent experience. Check in was prompt and professional. The room was a deluxe double at the end of the hall. Therefore it was very quiet. The mattress was very comfortable and the room recently renovated. Yes the bathroom was small but not as small as in the hotels in europe. It had black granite and a useful dimmer switch that was handy. The view overlooked union square and macys. All in all I would recommend the hotel as even the restaurant Scallys was very good and open till midnight. In compairson to other hotels I have stayed at in San Fran. I would give it 3.5 stars. I would stay there again since the location is perfect and the price was very good also. I don't understand some of the negative reviews as I travel every month around the globe and this hotel is very fine. Absolutely recomended indeed.

<Content>Loved the Drake! We loved this hotel. The service was absolutely wonderful and the staff couldn't be any more hospitable. The rooms are lovely and well maintained and the hotel lobby is beautiful. Room service was excellent and came to the room in a timely manner. Every request was met within minutes and with a smile....................I have already booked this hotel again for a stay in June. Many thanks to the staff of the Drake for wonderful and welcome experience.

<Content>Unbelievable customer service I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake with my fiance and my three children. We arrived very late on a Friday night (after midnight). Knowing that their room service closed at 10:00 p.m., I called earlier that day and made arrangements for non-perishable food to be left in our room. When we arrived, tired and hungry, the food was nicely laid out in the room as requested.While the hotel is older, the rooms are very comfortable and clean. The lobby is beautiful and the staff was polite and helpful.Unfortunately, my 9-year old daughter came down with the flu and was extremely ill when the time came to clean up the room and check out. Several hours after checkout, we realized that she had left her Nintendo DS, with all the games and carrying case, in the room. I immediately called the hotel and informed them of this situation. I followed up both in person and by telephone, but the hotel was unable to find the Nintendo. I therefore e-mailed the manager of the hotel explaining the situation to her. She launched her own investigation of the disappearance of the Nintendo -- to no avail. Then, to my surprise and the extreme pleasure of my daughter, Ms. Kershner informed me that the hotel would pay to replace my daughter's system. I informed her of the cost of the system and the games, and several weeks later, a check for that amount (plus some truffles, yum) came via Federal Express.This experience made my entire family a HUGE fan of the Sir Francis Drake Hotel!

<Content>Good value and location We booked our stay directly through the 800# at Kimpton Hotels. It was easy and fast. The hotel is in a very good location and is a good value for the money. The beds were very comfortable and the room we had (executive dbl dbl) was spacious but the bathrooms are small and can only allow one person at a time. The only negative I had was a standoffish staff member at the check in desk who confirmed my room type and saw that we were a family of four but never took the time to advise me that the extra sofa bed I was needing and expecting would not be in the room. So, we went to our room, found that it was missing, and had to call down to the front desk and inquire. We were offered two roll away beds, which I accepted. They filled our room completely but at least we all had a bed to ourselves. The hotel was a little bit dirty and certain things were left on the floor our entire stay! However, I still maintain that this is a good value given the prices of hotels in Union Square. Tip - park in the parking garage a block away for almost half the price of the hotel's valet service - $26 versus $45.

<Content>Great Hotel In Central Location My husband and two sons (ages 9 and 11) stayed here for three nights during Spring break. It's a beautiful historic building and the rooms, though cozy, are very nicely appointed. The doorman in his Beefeater uniform was very friendly and helpful and the Concierge was also very helpful. Parking is pricy ($45) per night for the valet, but anything in this location is bound to be. I loved the historic interior decor. My only complaint is that our 8th floor window was very dirty. Ask for an upper room. From the higher floors the noise from outside is just a pleasant city hum. From the lower floors, the constant ding-ding of the cable car could be annoying. On the plus side, there is a cable car stop right in front of the hotel. Also, the location is great if you like to walk to things like Union Square and Chinatown. Don't miss Sears Fine Foods just across the street. Really liked this hotel.

<Content>average hotel we attended a wedding in the hotel in general the hotel was fine the room was very small infact so small one of the closet doors could not open fully. the bathroom was small but had a wonderful shower. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly and the location of the hotel was perfect. I was dissapointed that the gym was not open but it is due to re open soon. The Star Light room was a nice place to start off the night and the q's for the lifts could be avoided by using the guest acces to the elevators located to your immediate left on entering the hotel. We read many different reviews on this hotel and were put off by them but now having stayed I would recommend it as a reasonable 3 star hotel not the most fancy but in a great location however rooms size is a problem. If you could afford to upgrade to a suite it would be well worth the money they were beutiful and very spacious. I would also recommend using the hotel cars for airport runs 鈧?5 one way.

<Content>Mini-Accomodations in a fine old building Stayed for 1 night and went to an event in a meeting room on the 2nd floor.Flew in to SFO and took BART into the city.$5.15 and just much easier and faster than you may think, practically door to door. Checked in at noon without problems. Front desk was very nice.They assigned me room 1232. Ran up to the room to dump my stuff and was surprised at the size of the room. Tiny. Maybe 8x14.The bathroom was in miniature too. Sink and toilet facing each other with about 18 inches between them and the bathrub ran the length, about 2 inches from the sink and toilet. Really small.In the bedroom, there was a full size bed, 2 small bedside tables, desk, chair and console with a TV and minibar.I don't mind small rooms when I travel alone, so the size did not bother me at all... It was just that I had only seen a hotel room this tiny once before (at the W on Lexington in NYC).Now, on to the funkiness of the hotel. It was pretty funky. The bed was clean and the table tops and such were clean but the walls were really nasty and the carpet was this very dark purple-y brown color. It did not look dirty... It was so dark I felt it must be dirty. The walls looked as if someone shook a hot can of coke and spewed it all over. The bed was pretty comfy but the pillows were both very firm.I ran down to the lobby to find a place for a quick bite. I stopped by the concierge and asked for a good sushi place and he recommended a place on Cyril Magnan (sp). I told him that was a little further than I wanted to walk right at the moment and was there anything good within a block. Keep in mind that there are probably 20 restaurants within a block. He turned into a [--] and rattled off 5 places in a second and when I repeated the only one I understood he said yeah, but its not that good. He was just very hateful. Kind of miserable. I was the only person there and there was no reason for him to get nasty when I ask for something a little closer. I mean, is a 2nd question too much to ask a concierge? Argh.So, I decided to go to the diner directly across the street. Sears is a good old fashioned diner. It's always good but the food is quite heavy and unhealthy... tasty though. I went to the event and thought the catering and event planning was good. The appetizers were good. Nice staff. Pretty meeting room.Then we headed to the sushi place recommended earlier, Hana Zen. Maybe it was an off night... pretty presentation, but only OK.Back to the hotel... Got ready for bed, took a shower where there was pretty low pressure. The tub is pretty long (maybe 5 or 6 feet) and deep. It was much better suited for a bath... which I decided to do. I cleaned it a little (just in case) then relaxed and read a magazine. It was nice.Check out the next morning at 930am and walked back to the BART station.San Francisco is beautiful. I wish I could have stayed longer... This hotel is in a wonderful location and I would stay here again if the price was right.

<Content>A bit " Faulty Towers". Stayed for 5 nights in November, 2006. Room was comfortable, king bed, comfy pillows, internet access. Windows were a little dirty and bathroom was unusual, but I put that down to the fact that it is an old hotel. Keycard on door failed to work for us on several occassions and when reported to front desk, the person on duty was very obliging and offered us free coffee vouchers! The tour desk girl was unprofessional as she took several private phone calls while trying to arrange our tour. My major concern was security as there are several entrances to the hotel anybody can have access to the lifts and we found a homeless person trying doors on our floor. I was not comfortable in the lifts on my own. The location is great. The only reason I would not go back is because of lack of security.

<Content>location is excellant BUT.......... Stayed at the Drake for 2 night s in mid January. While the location is excellent be aware of certain issues. First, we got a great rate on a hotel website, only $89 a night, what a deal! BUT parking $90!!!! $45 a night...! I expected the parking to be expensive, maybe $20 a night. $45 is just way too much.. The check in was easy and the front desk staff friendly. Our room... VERY TINY, especially the bathroom.. seriously, there is barely room to turn around... but the room we thought was very nice and classic looking. Another plus, the bar/restaurant on the top floor (oops forgot the name)... its very very romantic and the views are beautiful.

<Content>Good location, tiny bathroom Spent three nights at the Sir Francis Drake on business. The Good: - Great location. In the heart of shopping and restaurants of all price ranges. Directly across the street from a Walgreens and in the same block as Tiffany's  Saks. Borders is also across the street.- Comfortable bed. Nice quilted pillow-top mattress.- Terrific food. The food at the conference in the hotel was better than the restaurants than we visited.The Bad:- Tiny bathroom. There was more floor space in the bathtub than in the bathroom. You could sit on the toilet and wash your hands in the sink. There was no room for a toilet paper holder so the TP sat on the back of the toilet. Very little counter space.- The pillows are fluffy and soft. I piled two on top of each other to get enough firmness.- No coffee maker. There was a DVD player but no coffee maker. Go figure!- High parking fee, even higher for an SUV or pick-up. Park at the Union Square garage down the block if you don't need in-and-out privilege.

<Content>Great location - Clean - Classy This hotel is located right downtown in the Union Square area, very close to great shopping and dining. We stayed in a queen room which was surprisingly small. Very little extra room for anything, such as large suitcases or the in-room yoga program the hotel advertised. The bathroom was also very small. However, this hotel is undergoing renovations, and our room had been redone very recently. The furnishing were stylish and modern, the bed was VERY comfortable, the room had high-speedwireless internet, large TV, quality pillows, AVEDA bath products and plush robes. I enjoyed staying here because everything was clean and comfortable and new. I do wish the room had been a little larger - my sister and I found ourselves chatting after dinner in the lobby rather than our room because it was too small and confining. The concierge was great with restaurant recommendations. Also, watch out for the $45 dollar/day parking charge!

<Content>First Class Hotel We didnt stay here but did a sight inspection as part of work (I am a travel agent).The Sir Francis Drake Hotel is part of the United States largest boutique hotel chain 鈥?Kimpton Hotels. This property has a 鈥楩irst Class鈥?rating which I believe it deserves. It is located in Union Square and has a wide variety of shops, restaurants and cafes within walking distance.Rooms are of a smallish size, with striped d茅cor (Cream/Sage). The hotel also offers a Mind. Body. Spa program with in-room spa services, Yoga channel on every TV and complimentary yoga accessories for use during clients stay. Sir Francis Drake Hotel also has its own luxury nightclub 鈥?Starlight Room. This nightclub/bar offers fantastic views of San Francisco.The Powell/Hyde cable car goes straight past the entrance of this hotel so it is also very easy to get to Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf and Pier 33.This hotel had a very elegant feel to it and would suit couples, families with older children and business travellers.

<Content>Don't do it!!!!! The great location can't make up for this really badly run hotel. The first night we had to wait in line to use the elevator to get to our room -- there is a very popular nightclub on the 21st floor. There was no security at the elevator, and we didn't want to cut in front of already drunk people to get to our room. We were then kept up for hours by a whining window fan/AC. The next morning at 8am we were awakened by hammering. They moved us for the next night -- I immediatle tried the window a/c -- and it too was noisy. But on high it was quiet-ish. After waiting in line that night for our elevator again, we got to our room with a party going on next door. We turned on the fan (on high, of course) to drown them out. It was fine for a couple of hours, then started sounding like a car fan hitting a radiator. We tried sleeping with it off, but the street noise reverberates inside the a/c units and you hear every noise. I walked down at 3am to talk to the front desk. I was polite, but said I didn't think that this should be a problem paying over $200.00 a night for a room. He clicked on his computer and sniffed, through Expedia. Yes, through Expedia, but I STILL paid over $200 a night! On the plus side, they gave us free ear plugs. They say they're renovating, and the window fans are going, but that doesn't stop the elevator lines. And anyone who thinks it's acceptable to rent (very expensive!) rooms to people with malfunctioning equipment cannot be trusted.

<Content>Excellent Classic Hotel The reviews are wrong. This is an excellent, classic hotel located one block from Union Square. We had a large, pretty room that was recently renovated. Sign up for Kimpton's affinity program and take advantage of Kimpton matching any advertised rate. The hotel is half done with a complete renovation. Skylight Room on top floor has wonderful view of SF. Caffe Europa is excellent too. Free wireless. New fitness center to open soon. Friendly beefeater dressed doorman. $96 rate too!

<Content>Hated this hotel I had to come to San Francisco for a meeting - my favorite city, so I was excited. This hotel could ruin that. The first room I was given was on the fifth floor. I requested a non-smoking room and the odor of smoke when we stepped off the elevator was overwhelming, but it was nothing compared to the condition of the room we arrived at.First, someone had urinated all over the toilet. The vanity was also covered with debris. We should have been alerted by the garbage dumpster that sat outside the door in the hall.Upon our complaining, the hotel upgraded our room to the 20th floor. Here, we enjoyed the sounds of the disco UNTIL 2:00 A.M! This is the worst hotel in San Francisco. Please stay anywhere else unless you like to ride to your room in an elevator covered with vomit from an intoxicated guest to the disco upstair or stay in a substandard room at competitve rates. Wake up manager or owner. This is a disgrace!

<Content>Terrible Kimpton Hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights as part of a group in SF for a trade show. The room was smaller than your average cruise ship cabin. The bathroom the size of one on an airplane except with a shower that would not drain on the side. A window that has not been washed in more than a decade. The real kicker was the renovation that went on above and around us from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm and then after debris shiffted in the night at 6:00 am on the one morning we could sleep in. When it started I went into the bathroom because I thought the ceiling had fallen through. We were given the option to move for an extra $120.00 per night which would have made our per night rate $270.00 plus taxes. I have stayed at many Kimpton Hotels over the years and they should be ashamed to call this property a Kimpton.

<Content>HATED THE SERVICE and the room I booked a king room and got a queen. The sheets had blood stains on them. The sheets were ripped and did not fit the bed. Now the mananger is saying that I lied about the whole thing. The hotel is WAY over rated. I could have stayed at a motel 6 and got better service and better sheets to sleep on.

<Content>Sir Francis Drake, don't judge a hotel by the lobby Okay, So I did. I had read the mixed reviews on this site. But I didn't believe them. I loved the lobby and the location, so I booked. The hotel was crummy after you got in the elevator. The bathroom door didn't shut, the windows didn't open and were filthy. The staff was fine, the services were fine, but the fact remains this hotel is NOT living up to it's best, until it proves it's self- PLEASE stay elsewhere and enjoy your visit to SF more!

<Content>Nice Hotel in good location We are a family of three from England who spent seven nights at the Drake from 21st October. Having read previous grim reviews we were a little apprehensive but needn't have been . We found the hotel suited our holiday needs perfectly. However, we did email the hotel beforehand to request a refurbished room .The bedroom on 17th floor was of good size with two comfortable double beds and appeared recently decorated. The bathroom, although small was adequate and again very clean and well supplied with towels, toiletries etc. Staff when needed were always polite and efficient - in fact one day when maid forget to renew towels these were delivered to our door wthin five minutes of speaking to reception. Good views from the room but the windows were in desperate need of a clean (the only niggle we had). Would recommend both Sears and Lori's diner nearby for breakfast. As for location - it couldn't be bettered - easy walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown and other sights plus a cable car ride (stop outside hotel) to the bay.

<Content>Not that great We were scheduled to stay here for four nights, but only stayed for one, before switching hotels. That says a lot. You are greeted by men in beefeater costumes, which is slightly awkward. The lobby area is nice, but the rest of the hotel isn't. Staff is okay, but I have seen better at other places. The hotel is very dated, and old looking, which was not for us. The elevator is super old, and hallways dark, with paint peeling. The rooms are okay, but still not that modern. Bathrooms are tiny, with no place to put anything, due to lack of shelves. Overall, you can do a lot better in San Francisco, so do not stay here!

<Content>Good service, but rooms left a lot to be desired I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake when in SF for a conference. I've stayed at other Kimpton hotels and really like the chain. The Sir Francis Drake was the least nice of the Kimpton hotels I've stayed in, but it wasn't terrible. It's true that the windows are very dirty and the non-renovated rooms are simply atrocious. (Demand a renovated room.) Also, the street noise is pretty heavy and the recently renovated rooms smell heavily of noxious paint fumes. That said, the front desk staff was very helpful and eventually moved me to a junior suite that faced Union Square so it was much less noisey. Also, the bellmen are terrific!Even so, I probably will not stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Great San Fran Hotel I did a web search to get the best price and the hotel matched it. When I arrived they had upgraded me to a much nicer room than I reserved.Then while watching football they had cookies, chocolates and water delievered to me. Felt spoiled.The bed was incredible. Whenever I stay in San Fran I will always stay at a Kimpton and this is one of the best.

<Content>Beautiful Renovation The Sir Francis Drake has an awesome location right on Union Square and the Cable Car line. My obviously newly renovated room was clean and wonderful with very comfortable beds, large flat panel LCD televisions and obivously brand new bathrooms. I was a little hesitant about booking this hotel after reading the reviews on here, but after checking into my room I inquired at the concierge desk (wonderful concierge btw!) and was told the hotel was in the final stages of a comprehensive renovation of all of the guest rooms, the heating and air conditioning systems, the public spaces and the beautiful lobby and restaurant. Anyone who has seen the negative reviews should realize that the renovated product is as nice as anything in the city! The concierge told me that most of the rooms are renovated now with the remainder in progress and that all of the windows will also be replaced with brand new windows in the next few months. I had heard the restaurant was good, and it turned out to be one of the best meals I have had in years. Judging from the full house I am guessing others agree!

<Content>Nice hotel in Union Square My wife and I concluded our honeymoon with 3 nights at the Sir Francis Drake.The keyword here is service. The staff, from the front desk to the doormen, goes all out for the guests. Requests for extra towels were promptly answered and room service was perfect.The location is on Powell Street, a block from Union Square, and on a main cable car line. If you don't like street noise, book a room on the upper levels. We were on 5, and could hear the cable cars and traffic -- not a problem for us, but could be for others. As with every other downtown SF hotel, be prepared to pay for cab rides that can get expensive ($20 to the hotel from the Legion of Honor/Lincoln Park area, and $10 to Fisherman's Wharf). However, it beats trying to drive and navigate this city.The upstairs bar, Harry Denton's, isn't much. They promote it heavily in the hotel as a cocktail/piano bar, but the night we were there, it was a DJ playing hip-hop remixes. Absolutely no different than any other club. Try The Top of the Mark instead if you want a low-key place for after hours drinks.It should be said this is an old-style hotel, meaning rooms are smaller than modern construction and bathrooms are as well. If you need spacious accomodations, go elsewhere. The room decor was a little dated. Water pressure was good though, to the point that toilets flushed overhead could be heard in our room. For us, a source of more amusement than concern. The rooms are said to be undergoing renovation, which may solve the decor issues, but not the size. We did not attempt internet connection, nor did we watch TV, so we can't comment on those features.Again, the high point was exceptional guest service. We are prepared to make this our home in SF.

<Content>Walked In and Walked Right Out This place is to be avoided. Others in my work group had picked this place, and I joined them, at a rate of about $240.I was in the room for about 1 minute before I walked out and obtained a full refund. I simply explained tha the property was not up to my standards. The filthy windows, taped over bath vent and mold are still there. Size was an issue, to be sure. There is no reason for this hotel to be visited, save for the lobby and location. I spent $50 more at the Ritz Carlton and had a perfect stay.

<Content>Please, PLEASE do not stay here!! The facts: non-smoking room REEKED of smoke, as did the lobby. Windows were so dirty that you literally could not see out. Auto-focus camera actually could not focus past the glass. Bathroom full of mold, countless broken tiles, bathtub's entire surface was chipped off and jagged. Electrcal outlet boxes were literally hanging from the walls. I could not even use the restroom. Upon inquiring whether we had some kind of reject room, we were told this was actually an upgraded room. We left literally 20 minutes after checking in, but the hotel refused to refund for the room or for a night of parking. This is an old hotel, but do not confuse this dump with historic. This hotel is not fit to be a flop house. Staff was neither helpful NOR friendly. Upon check-in, the clerk made a major point of announcing to the entire floor that we booked our stay through Hotels, as if to embarass us about it. No effort was made to try to make us happy, or keep us from leaving. This is a Kimpton hotel, a brand I've had good luck with. Someone from corporate should really take a look at these guest rooms, and honestly tell me that THEY would stay there... Very, very sad.

<Content>There are MUCH better hotels in San Francisco My husband and I spent two nights at the Sir Francis Drake this past weekend, he was a groomsman in a wedding and the reception was being held at the hotel. I really did not want to stay at the hotel with the wedding party, having read the reviews on Trip Adviser and knowing that there are SO MANY better hotels around Union Square that we have stayed at before. We received a discounted room rate of $149 per night for a 'deluxe king' room, and paid an additional $45 per night for valet parking. I don't have a problem paying this kind of money for a hotel, as long as it is worth the price. I did NOT find this to be true for the Sir Francis Drake.Our 'deluxe king' room was nothing more than a basic hotel room with a king size bed. The room was about 200 square feet, we were in #712. In fact, it seemed smaller than usual because we had a bigger bed. The deco-style decor and furnishings, though not my taste, were colorful and tacky, but in good shape. As reported in an earlier review, it is true that the one small window was so dirty that you could barely see out of it. The real problem that I had was with the bathroom. It was so incredibly small that my husband and I could not be in there together. I guess that I would have been able to overlook the small size of the bathroom had it not been so disgusting.The bathtub had stains on the bottom and huge cracks all the way across the tile wall that were badly patched. There was mold and mildew on the ceiling and the surrounding walls. The ventilation duct was taped over so there was no air circulation in the bathroom, though keeping the bathroon door open and blasting the a/c helped a little. The shower curtain had mold on it as well. The faucet in the sink constantly dripped and the drain from the sink dripped on the floor (the housekeeping staff left a lovely washcloth there to absorb the water). The wood threshold leading into the bathroom was loose and half rotted (water damage?) and our toilet seat was barely attached to the toilet. It was the worst bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel. It was the consensus of others in the wedding party that there rooms were just as bad. Luckily we didn't have to spend much time in them. It was obvious that the bride and groom didn't check out the rooms before booking their reception at the hotel, there is no way that they would have chosen this place for their guests.I do have only good things to say about the catering/special event staff and the facilities for the wedding reception. The room was beautiful and the food was excellent. If you are visiting San Francisco, do some research and you will find a much better place to stay with just as good of a location. My husband says he will listen to me next time about where we stay. :)

<Content>Class and comfort--for our entire company! This summer I booked my NY company for a week-long leadership retreat at the Sir Francis Drake. Just before we left, I was notified of negative reviews on Trip Advisor.com, and it made me a little nervous. However, our entire stay was perfect--without one single complaint from our staff of 47 people (believe me, I would have heard about it!!) Instead, all I heard were raves from everyone. A few even extended their stay at the Drake for a personal vacation.The hotel is gorgeous, clean and classy, and ideally located near tons of shopping and restaurants of every kind. A cable car runs right in front of the hotel and takes you in 10 minutes to the Fisherman's Wharf, and Chinatown is within a two-minute walk. Best of all, the hotel staff--from the front desk to the caterers to the maintenance workers--were all professional, prompt and very friendly. Even the catered food (and we ordered the most inexpensive variety) was delicious.All in all, the hotel gave us class-A service for a great bargain price. I got big kudos from our company directors for booking us there, so--what more can I say?--THANK YOU Drake Hotel!!!

<Content>Great location but really small rooms The location is great. The cable cars run out front and are easy to catch. However, the room was surprisingly small. The bed pretty much filled up the room. Also, there were few cable channels. Good thing we were out of the room most of the time. Also, the hotel is doing renovations and the bathroom exhaust for the shower was covered with plastic. This left the bathroom stuffy and we had to run the air conditioning to air out the room. We would probably not stay here again.

<Content>Music is not what they say it is Went to the Starlight room to enjoy the entertainment and was a Big Mistake. Most of the nights they have a band but this night they had a DJ. The Hotel said the DJ starts at 8:30 and plays various kinds of music. He didn't start until 9:30 and only played Hip Pop music. They same song seemed to last an hr and a half. You can hear the same music on most corners in San Francisco. Stay away unless you are in to this so called music.

<Content>Horrible experience. Horrible service. Called twice to have television looked at and no one ever came. Called twice and waited 45 minutes to have luggage picked up. Vent over the shower was missing and crammed with plastic. Windows were so dirty you can't even see out of them. Very old worn out rooms that are not maintained and staff that take themselves far too serious and customer service far too lightly. You can stay a 1/2 block away for half the price and double the service.

<Content>ok, but won't be back We are a family of 4 and stayed on the 10th floor. Room was tiny, no fridge, and small bathroom. Room stuffy unless air conditioner constantly running. One window that one could see out of only if you stood on your tip-toes, but then you find out the view of the old buildings below are not worth it. Window did not open. However, room clean and well-painted; bathtub is very long and has a very large drain with lots of suction when draining-watch out! No vent in bathroom so could not leave door closed. We had to call everyday for extra bath towels because they would only supply 2. If you like a great view, good music/dancing and appetizers/drinks, highly recommend the Starlight room on the 21st floor; however, the hostess is a bit gruff, like a KGB agent. Had oysters and we crunched on shell particles that had not been cleaned properly when opened. Call ahead for a reservation. Also highly recommended is Scala restaurant downstairs. Again, make reservations days in advance. You can do this via e-mail. Lots of good eating places nearby, especially when you have children. Recommend Lori's Diner just across the street-great variety. Cable car stop is conveniently located and you can take it all the say down to the wharf area.

<Content>Not even if you paid me a million pound....I would never stay here again This hotel was my final destination on my round the world trip before jetting back to England. I had stayed in fantastic hotels in Singapore, Sydney and Tahiti and to stay here was such a disappointment that coming home and going back to work didn't seem to tedious! The hotel has such an unclean factor about it. I was put in a smoking room (which I requested) and after an hour I requested to move room as there seemed to be something moving around and scrapping above the ceiling. To be honest, it sounded liked rats or mice, put it this way, it wasn't human! They only smoking room left was a few floors down and I was warned that it was a little small. SMALL????!!!!! you couldn't swing a cat in it! The double bed took up the whole floor space and it was situated right by the lifts. Constant noise all day and night. The view out the window was of a brick wall, but I thought 'heck, you are only sleeping here, go explore San Francisco'.That was the plan until, on the 3rd morning at the hotel, the shower stopped working. After 5 phone calls to maintenance, and 3 hours later, someone came up to have a look at it and I was told there is a problem with the water affecting a few rooms on that floor. But I was assured that it would be fixed in good time. After a quick 'sink' wash, I headed out, only to return some hours later to find that the shower still didn't work. To cut a long story short, it took the hotel 48 hours to get it fixed. I was offered no real apology and had to ask to use another room to get a shower. Apparently, they were all booked up to move me on a permanent basis. Unbelieveable! Would I stay here again? Not even if you got me in a first class seat to San Francisco from Heathrow and gave me a million pounds to stay in this hotel. Do yourself a favour, book elsewhere.

<Content>Not leaving my heart in this place in San Francisco I've been in homes with larger clothes closets than the rooms in this hotel. The bathroom is incredibly small; hardly room to turn around - little if any vanity space. But that isn't the major problem. Customer Service is severely lacking. When I called this morning to cancel my wake up call, I was told that it was already programmed so just have the phone ring and hang up. DUH! The point is I didn't WANT the phone to ring. My colleague called the front desk to request a bed be made up differently and was advised to call housekeeping, herself. This is suppossed to be a fine, old hotel. NOT!

<Content>Stay Somewhere Else The problem starts when you try to check in and the rooms aren't ready. By the time that the rooms were ready, the entire lobby was filled with guests waiting to check-in. But that still didn't get additional people behind the desk. One of the elevators operated all day with only half of its interior lights working.The rooms are very, very small and very, very shabby. The floor tiles in the bathroom are chipped and missing in places. The finish is mostly gone from the bottom of the tub. The electrical outlets by the desk are too old to handle 3-prong plugs and if you need to plug something in, you have a choice of pulling the plug for the lamp or the refrigerator. The window is coated with dirt. The noise from the street is constant. Every complaint is answered with the same response - we are going to get a multi-million dollar upgrade soon. One of my worst hotel experiences. The location is wonderful, but there are many other hotels in the vicinity that provide better accomodations and service.

<Content>Stay Away From Here! This hotel is a DUMP! The rooms are tiny, filthy, and stinky. The cable cars will wake you up every morning as they ring their bells. If you are able to sleep through this, you will wake up as soon as your neighbor turns on his TV. The walls are so thin, you can hear everything that goes on in the neighboring rooms. There is so much mold, dirt, and dust in this place, I have been sick for the past week. Stay far, far, away from this HISTORIC DUMP!

<Content>Avoid this hotel I just spent a week at the Sir Francis Drake in San Francisco. When we checked in we were given a dark tiny room that measured only 8 1/2 feet wide(I carry a tape measure to measure purchases) The bathroom was not much larger than a closet and had black mold on the walls and ceiling. When we complained we were given a larger room but still shabby and dirty. No am't of pattern could hid the dirt on the carpet. The toilet was stained, the floors were dirty and there was mold on the walls. In the bath there was a very large window. This would have been a feature except that the temperatures that week dropped at night to the 30's and there was no source of heat in the bathroom. I asked for an extra blanket and the one I was given was torn and stained. Several times during our stay the elevators did not function and we had to walk down 17 flights of stairs. Overall this hotel is dark, dirty and smells bad. This had to be the worst hotel I have ever visited.

<Content>Great location! We stayed at the Sir Francis Drake Feb. 15-20. The location was great! The rooms were small, but nice. Five of us were in town for a Coldwell Banker Conference. Three in our group shared a room. The room was a little small for three, so they asked for an upgrade. They got a larger room with a sofa bed and two bathrooms for $40 more per night! We took the cable car to Union Square  Fisherman's Wharf. Just hopped on it right out front! I highly recommend the Golddust around the corner. Great Bar, live music, good time. The Starlight room has an amazing view of the city. It was a very romantic place. We had a wonderful meal in China Town at The House of Nan King. If it is your first time, the chef likes to order for you. I also suggest The Steps of Rome for Italian. The waiters dance with you if you say it's your birthday. The food is good  a fun atmosphere!We didn't get to go to Alcatraz because the tours were sold out. Make a reservation!I loved San Francisco, I will be back! I would stay at the Sir Francis Drake again. It isn't the Ritz, but I didn't pay for the Ritz!

<Content>Superficially grand, but scratch the surface... .... and you find an old, poorly maintained place. My wife and I spent an evening at the SFD to catch a play down the street, just off Union Square. We'd had a nice post-theatre meal last year at the hotel restaurant, Scala's, and thought the hotel would be worth a try. The location is terrific - just off Union Square, on the cable car line, etc. We'd stayed at another Kimpton property in Boston and were impressed by the hip neo-classic styling in the rooms and the attitude of the place. Well, at the Drake, the look comes off like an old Hollywood starlet who's now getting by on cat food.  It has a beautiful old turn of the century lobby with some of Kimpton's signature touches - nouveau high-style furnishings, etc. - the stylistic elements of which repeat in the rooms, per Kimpton's formula. But it comes across as too formulaic here, and a band-aid on some real problems. Such as: paper-thin walls between the rooms; sooty windows; poor temperature control throughout the hotel (about 55潞 in the lobby on the chilly day, okay, but at their retro rooftop lounge, Harry Denton's Starlight Room it was also downright chilly - no budget for, say, a Home Depot thermostat?). Our bathroom had only a handicapped shower mounted at nose level - necessitating a crouch to get wet (we never requested this type of room, and the place was clearly not full). Above the shower stall, a hole in the wall covered by a rectangle of white plastic held in place by some old white fabric tape. (!) The hallways were renovated in a half-baked way: hip-ish light fixtures but depressing brown walls, beat up doors, and a vague rotting smell. We won't be returning soon - the Drake has potential to be a flashy retro hotel experience, but Kimpton needs to pump some serious dough into it to make it a liveable place again.

<Content>3rd Time Back! This hotel is great! I stay here every year and wouldn't consider anywhere else. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I especially like it when the staff remembers you even though you come once a year. With all the people coming in and out who could remember a face. San Francisco has some of the best and if not the greatest places to eat. The hotels Cafe Espresso is great for a breakfast and lunch. There is also Sears Restaurant across the street from the hotel as well. I had breakfast,lunch and dinner there, need I say more. I highly recommend the Steamed Mussels for dinner. This property is the ideal location.

<Content>We came away totally satisfyed Like others, we had some reservations about the mixed reviews about this hotel and didn't know what to expect; needless to say that the hotel completely exceeded our expectations. You can get a good deal from the discout internet sites like Hotwire. The service was courteous and professional, and unlike other hotels, which are cookie cutter copies of each other, Sir Francis Drake is distinctive and eclectic. Sure the hotel shows some of its age, especially in the bathrooms, but the first room we were in was well appointed and clean, with a large TV; although on the smaller side, anyone used to traveling in Europe and NYC will not feel uncomfortable. The air conditioner was in the window, but this was not obtrusive at all.We also dined at La Scala; great food and service and had a drink in the Starlight room, which offers one of the best views of the city in an exceedingly elegant setting. The service was superb; one evening we had some friends stay with us. We asked for a cot at 2am, but they gave a larger room with double beds at no extra cost.Finally, you can鈥檛 possibly beat this location; a block from Union Square and walking distance to Nob Hill and China town. Go ahead, try this place out!! You can probably get it between $70-90 a night on one of the discount websites.

<Content>Executive Room is good I saw all the reviews on here after i had booked a room and felt a little afraid, but decided to go ahead anyway as it is such a good location for shopping. I had booked an executive room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms and it was fabulous. Didn't have dirty windows, very clean and spacious. Staff could not have been more helpful. Only down side, was that apparently my friend could hear the elevator in the night, i could not! Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Location As this was our first visit to SF and having read lots of bad reviews about this hotel we were a bit concerned at what it would be like.Well lets say straight away what a great location. Cable car right outside the door, Union square and the shops and restaurants 100yds away! The staff were all really friendly and helpfull. We had a room on the 4th floor. Whilst it was not a great view it was large enough with 2 queen size beds, plenty of cupboard space and decent sized bathroom. Afterall we didn't come to SF to look at the view from a hotel window! The decor does need a bit of a refurbish but how much time do you want to spend in a city hotel! All in all we thought it was good value for money. We did not eat at the restaurant Scala's but it was always full and busy which is a good sign. We did go to Harry Denton's starlight Lounge and were disappointed - This is really a place for 30's something IT girls and posers not for mature 40's - the dress code on a friday appeared to be Jeans! shame really because the band were really good.

<Content>not good enough service, decadent rooms The position of this hotel is the onyl good thing, but we were really disappointed by all the rest. First, we booked for a deluxe room and we get less than a standard room. When we told the receptionist, he changed the room but again this was not satisfactory. The price was too much for that room, definitively! The smell inside was awful and there was no possibility to open the window! The receptionist told us that the hotel will have a renovation soon, but who cares?

<Content>"I value my integrity" Was the mantra of the staff. When I asked for a nice room, the front desk clerk told us, I value my integrity, so I must tell you, this hotel is very old. I will do my best.We arrive in our room to find that it is a 9'x21' Box. The window was partially blocked by the window air conditioner, which was okay cause the window was SOOOO filthy that you couldn't really see outside. Fortunately, we brought our personal DVD player (the television selection was horrible. The TV was old with a bad picture. I plugged the DVD player into the tv's rca jacks, but the tv wouldn't accept the signal. When I called guest services the clerk told me, I value my integrity. Our televisions are very old. I don't think they accept a signal from a DVD player. Hmm, I am beggining to smell a theme. If a guest asks a question about the hotel, Just tell them that you value your integrity, but the hotel hasn't been renovated in 78 years. They will understand. If the guest doesn't seem appeased by your honesty, offer them an upgrade, for an additional fee. If you REALLY value your integrity, find another job. I am not taking potshots at the employees, but come on, you don't have to use a gun to steal from people..This hotel is a great example of owner milking the name of a (formerly) grand property for all it is worth. They charge a premium, and deliver NOTHING. Not a cup of coffee, not a newspaper, nothing, nada....squat.This is the second Kimpton property that we have stayed at that did not meet our expectations, the first was the Villa Florence. Same story, smaller scale. At least the Villa Florence had an afternoon wine reception so that you could get good and drunk and forget about how you were ripped off.IF YOU ARE LARGE (in the caboose) do not under any circumstances check into the hotel. The space between the sink and the bathroom wall in the toilet area is VERY tight. We are not overweight (by today's standards) and I knew that another 50 lbs. and I would have a problem. How embarassing would that phone call be when you can not get off the pot.If you are unfortunate enough to be reading this from the Sir Francis Drake (SFD), don't waste your money in their restaurants, go across the street and eat at Sears Fine Foods. This place is legendary, for a good reason. They have the best breakfasts I have eaten in my life. The corned beef hash is to die for. And the little swedish pancakes are irresistible. Since I am on the subject of food, check out Anjou, 44 Campton Place, just 1 1/2 block from the SFD. This little French restaurant is amazing. A real gem. My wife and I have eaten there several times and have never been disappointed. We have spent considerable time in Paris and this food rivals, if not exceeds what we found in France. Last night we had 2 large appetizers (the toasted brioche of duck foie gras, imported from France with heart leek salad and sauteed apples) and one special entree which is usually the wild salmon with mushroom and something mousse in a puff pastry. It was all absolutely fabulous and with a bottle of napa merlot, the bill came to $105.00!

<Content>Ideal location for cable cars Step out of the lobby and there's a cable car stop right outside. We loved this way of getting around and bought a 3 day MUNI pass for $18 which more than paid for itself. The hotel was ideally situated for getting to all the main attractions easily and we'd definitely stay in the Downtown area again as a base for sightseeing. Our room was small, but fine for a city hotel and we decided not to ask to move. The guidebooks were spot on with the description of the hotel: faded grandeur and the old chipped bathroom tile, but comfy beds, no skimping on decent toiletries and overall we were very happy. The staff were all very helpful and professional, and the concierges were brilliant at suggesting and booking restaurants. Top tip: All the guidebooks recommend breakfast at Sears Fine Foods directly opposite the hotel (queues every day) but we ate there one day and every other day went back for the breakfast in the hotel restaurant - Scalas. Food and service was excellent and the bill was not that different.

<Content>don't do it.... this place does not merit any kind words. where to begin.....my travel agent was not able to get me a room at the Parc 55 were I typically stay for business so i ended up at the sir francis drake. never again. the furniture was old broken down and dirty, the carpet sticky, the hallways musty, and the bathroom just dreary. Pay the extra whatever it may be and stay somewhere else. Oh, almost forgot the the one nice thing was that the cleaning crew decided to leave me a big glob of crusty grape jelly on the coffee table. thank you sir francis drake for a dismal experience.

<Content>Worst experience ever I booked a room thru Hotels, at $277/night. I arrived late at night and went to get dinner at La Scala before going up to my room. The food was terrible. I get to my room around midnight, it reeks of smoke. I asked for non-smoking but they gave me a smoking room. Furthermore, it was below the Starlight lounge and I can hear the music pounding thru the ceiling. I called to complain and they said there's nothing they can do because the hotel is sold out. They would've offered me a discount but since I didn't book the hotel directly, they can't do a thing. Later, when I received my credit card statement, not only did Hotels charge me, so did the hotel. I called to complain and instead of giving me immediate satisfaction (the accounting dept. was closed for the night), I had to call back later to complain. I'm never using Hotels again and I'm never staying at another Sir Francis Drake.

<Content>Not worth your time and money I travel to San Francisco often but usually stay at the Westin St. Francis or the Clift. My wife arrange this stay based on a conference she was attending. I was disappointed by the hotel and do not believe that the relatively cheaper rates (compared to other hotels in the downtown area) make it worth it to stay here. The main basis for the disappointment was the room itself, which I found small and unattractive. Placing the veneer of vintage boutique did not make it any more appealing. The closets were too shallow to put coats in. The bathroom was particularly difficult to manuever in from a space perspective. The embedded hair dryer in the bathroom had a large piece of casing missing and smoked when turned on! While we were given a replacement, amazingly the original smoking dryer was never replaced. I would put even odds on the possibility that it will not be replaced for a while. The placement of electrical outlets near the desk was very inconvenient, forcing me to work sitting on the bed. Finally, the room service was temporarily unavailable two out of three nights, which was frustrating.I will say that the wireless access was seamless, but I think that this should be expected of most hotels in SF.

<Content>aargh Okay, so I thought I had found a deal on the Westin St.Francis, but to my surprise it was the Sir Francis Drake. Anyway we got to the hotel and checked in . The lobby is pretty nice, but that鈥檚 about it. My wife and I got to out room (Room 816) it smelt musty/mold. The smell was so bad I called the lobby. John was kind enough to offer us another room. In fact he was so nice he gave us a suite. We got to the suite and well, it was mediocre at best. Old, smelly and well just not worth $159 a night ($189 after taxes). Stay at the Parc55 or better yet the Westin St. Francis. :(

<Content>Spend Your Money Elsewhere Yes, the lobby is lovely. The staff is relatively polite and accomodating. However, when we arrived in the early evening their was a long line of about 50 eurotrash who had obiously started early and were already sloshed standing in wait for the nightclub on the top floor. Smarmy stares from guys in cheap polyester suits and eau de alcohol was not what I was looking forward to after a long day of travel. Noises of people in a different mind state than ours lingered through the hallways throughout the duration of the evening as non guests explored.Things took a turn for the worse when we stepped out of the elevator. THE HALLWAYS SMELLED OF PUTRID, ROTTING, RUBBISH! Perhaps somehow by result of the dumpster from the restaurant, but my spouse and I almost gagged! When we walked in to our room the smell was only slightly less, (or perhaps our noses just got used to it). The rooms are clean and well stocked with amenities. The carpets are in bad need of replacement, (most hotels know that carpets should be replaced at least every two years, depending on traffic). The decor itself is outdated, which would be fine if we were not paying a high price. It felt like we were sleeping in a 1994 children's movie. We had a large picture window with a fantastic view of... the roof. Oh, and the dozens of beer bottles left by past victims who obviously tool advantage of oppurtunity.The bathroom was clean and cute, (ugh, but for the badly needed to be replaced wallpaper). I live in a house built in 1905, so I am used to antique fixtures. Yes, the Aveda products are nice. The hotel sent me an online survey and I was frank in my response. Customer service was kind enough to reply, and informed me that the building is scheduled for renovation in 2006. She mentioned that the hotel is old and the srestle wih difficulties regarding age, but I stay in old hotels all the time and have never experienced issues like this. This is in fact one of my worst stays in a hotel ever.Perhaps next year things shall improve, but I will never really know.

<Content>My first visit to San Fran - Nice hotel experience Nice hotel with friendly staff.Good location in a very busy area of town near Union Square. The rooms are clean, comfortable and we had a nice view of the city. The floors creak as they are made of wood, but having grown up in a house with wood floors, I liked it. :)The colorscheme in our room was a light sage green and cream with medium-dark wood furnishings. The TV is not very big and the bed was not ultra comfortable like the new-fangled beds, but it was nice and cozy. What I liked most about the hotel is that it felt more like a room at a bed and breakfast and not at all like a stuffy hotel room.

<Content>We must have been lucky! Well, we liked this hotel. I have just written 2 other reviews panning others so I am not a pushover. Our room was really lovely, loved the old tiled bathroom, the bed was comfortable and really, I have nothing bad to say about it at all. Staff were very nice and efficient. Being able to go up to the Starlight rooms for a bottle of champagne before bed was great. Food was also very good indeed.I'd love to come back, it was fun.

<Content>Wonderful experience stops at the Lobby Stayed 3 nights at the hotel - took up 2 rooms. Location is excellent! Lobby is awesome. However, the rooms leave much to be desired. We've stayed at several of the best hotels in the world, and this one was far from the best. While the room was clean, it was musty, smelled damp and the bathroom showed much sign of aging - not to mention that it was tiny. The beds were not particularly firm, and when we asked nicely for a late check out over the phone, the front desk guy was almost rude. When we went down to see him in person, he was being equally rude to anyone else on the phone.Anyways, find it hard to recommend this hotel, unless you're getting a good rate.

<Content>Hotel in Bad Condition, Great Service! My wife and i stay in the worst room i had ever seen room 532. The tub would not drain, wallpaper was ugly, room smelled musty. I asked the front desk (Martin) to move rooms and he smiled and he quickly moved me to a great room room 1801.. over looking the city. If you stay at this hotel ask for him. I might have gotten up and left to the Crown hotel next door if it was not for the friendly staff at the door and front desk. The roof bar had great views. Ask for one of there new rooms!Cheers!

<Content>Great location, very dated accomodations I booked 2 rooms on hotwire, was expecting the worse based on the reviews so I had low expectations. Generally, everyone was right on with their reviews. The bedding is very uncomfortable and worn, the bathrooms seriously need an update. One of our rooms had no faucet in the sink- water spewed out of the drain if you can believe it! Aveda products help make it better. Staff is helpful and the location is great but we stayed at the crowne plaza holiday inn 2 months ago and paid less on hotwire and the rooms were much roomier, comfortable and new. The staff was much friendlier too. Luckily, only slept at Sir Francis Drake. We would not stay here again.

<Content>Disgraceful service for a reputable hotel Everytime I am in San Francisco, I'll never miss a visit to Scala and Starlight at Sir Francis Drake. The service at both places had been excellent, until my last visit between August 18-22, 2005.It was an unplanned visit and therefore I didn't bring along my exclusive dresses, only jeans, skirts and sneakers...but I thought that shouldn't stop me from enjoying myself.On one of the nights, I handed over my jeans jacket and a handbag to the Hostess at the Cloak Room to keep as I wanted to dance. When I went back to collect them, I saw the Hostess kept my things on the floor, where there were plenty of hangers available, while my companion's jacket was kept nicely hang up. I was rather upset and cross and just refused to give her any tips, although my companion offered the tips on my behalf. I don't know what was the reason for her to treat me with such a manner, but I thought that was very disgraceful for a reputable hotel like Sir Francis Drake, and I should let everyone know about it. I will still visit the Scala and Starlight when I visit San Francisco, but surely will not consider staying at Sir Francis Drake Hotel.
