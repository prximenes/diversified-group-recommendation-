<Content>Love this Hotel - the Four Seasons is always consistent in service/details etc The Four Seasons is a personal favourite of mine. Every Hotel of this incredibly efficient hotel group provides their customers with a lovely experience that always leaves me leaving refreshed and relaxed. Having stayed at The Four Seasons in Beverly Hills and Sharm El Sheik (THE BEST), this Hotel Group has been consistently brilliant. The rooms, the staff, the level of service....all are excellent. Our room in HK was spacious, comfortable on a luxurious level, well lit (floor to ceiling windows over looking Hong Kong) and had an incredible bathroom, You always feel like you have arrived when you stay at the Four. They also have a large infinity pool area with fantastic views over the city and the staff are so welcoming. I cant recommend this (or any of their other hotels enough). They are the epitome of excellence and I would/have recommend them to everyone!

<Content>Perfection! We got engaged during our 2 night stay at the Four Seasons for New Years 2009 and every moment was complete perfection! This hotel -- its rooms, restaurants, spa, gym, pool -- is a heavenly oasis in a busy, crowded, bustling city. Our room on the 35th floor had a beautiful harbor view and the hotel management clearly pays attention to every detail, from the setup of the rooms to the service. Because the hotel management knew that this was our engagement stay, they placed a bottle of chilled champagne in our room for our arrival and then followed by delivering a miniature wedding cake and box of chocolates. They also prepared a special bath for us with fragrant oils and rose petals.We booked a one-hour massage in the couples room which was in a pod-like room that overlooked the beautiful pool area. The service at the gym and spa is seamless and calming and the spa setup was intimate but spacious, with attention to details like chilled wet towels, bottles of Fiji water, and pitchers of different types of cold teas and juices. We left the spa completely relaxed and at peace. The concierge service is the most attentive of any hotel we've ever stayed at. Betty at the concierge desk went above and beyond what we expected to get us information about some hikes we wanted to go on, printing out maps and information and having the information delivered to our room.We had booked a bed and breakfast package, so we had breakfast at The Lounge and Lung King Heen. Both had great food and beautiful views. We also enjoyed lunch at Caprice, which was a beautifully designed restaurant that was modern, open and bright. We loved the views, open kitchen, beautiful Swarovski chandelier and details above the kitchen, and contemporary white and gold tableware. The food was comparable to the best food we've had in Paris, both in presentation and taste, and we have only compliments about the service, which was attentive but not overbearing.Thank you Four Seasons Hong Kong, Shinichi, Quentin and the rest of the staff for an unforgettable and perfect engagement stay!!

<Content>Four Seasons Hong Kong - a must Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong is one of the best hotels I've stayed at. Everything about the hotel is 5 stars - the restaurants, the bar, exercise room, pool (with a view of the harbor), service, location and the rooms and suites. Book rooms with a harbor view. The view is incredible. Conveniently located in the Central District so lots of shopping, restaurants. Easy to walk everywhere.

<Content>Excellent Stayed here for five days in October, for a work conference.There's probably not much to add to the reviews already on this site - this really is a very good hotel. As an example - I wandered outside when it was just starting to drizzle, and one of the hotel staff ran after me to give me an umbrella. Had a harbour view room on the 37th floor - excellent views of Kowloon - for HKD$4200/night inc tax. All the fixtures and fittings are, as you'd expect, pretty decent quality. Only gripe - the TV in the bathroom is positioned straight on, and isn't angled, so you can't actually view it properly when you're in the tub. The gym is open 24 hours (yes!), and has a reasonable selection of equipment - free weights pretty good. Swimming pool was excellent - right in the middle of all these skyscrapers, and with views over to Kowloon. Ate in the Cantonese restaurant, Lung King Heen - breakfast and dinner. It was totally deserted in the morning - I guess not many people feel like congee and dumplings - so I had the whole place to myself. Very pleasant, though, and less crowded than the lobby lounge, which is the other option for breakfast. Dinner in Lung King Heen was great - a group of us went on a Tuesday night, expecting it to be empty, but it was actually pretty busy. Typical Cantonese fare - hairy crabs, dumplings, steamed fish etc. Came to about HKD$1000/head.Also had room service a few times - pretty much flawless. The Blue Bar on the ground floor is great for drinks and snacks - also gets quite crowded in the evening. Great apple martinis (though definitely for those with sweet tooths). The hotel is attached to the IFC mall, which is handy I guess. Though most of the shops are unlikely to be of any interest to overseas visitors - loads of big name designers, but all completely deserted. Maybe more useful for the cinema and the restaurants in it - we went to a place called Isola, which was great for a casual evening. If you don't have much luggage, I guess you could walk through the IFC mall to the Airport Express, but they also have their own minivan which will ferry you across the road if you can't manage. Not sure if they pick up from there, though.

<Content>Spectacular hotel...excellent location Great location (only IC maybe better) on the waterfront, connected to the IFC luxe mall, walking distance to Star Ferry, easy and cheap cab ride to peak tram, and close to nightlife. Wow! The hotel design/decor is spectacular. Jaw-dropping view from premier harbor view room (#3701) as near to a corner room as you can get in an arc-shapped hotel. Restaurant service spot-on, concierge and front desk always available, and housekeeping respected my privacy. And even if you are not a spa person, you MUST take a look at this facility. State of the art and comfort in every way. Can't imagine staying anywhere else.

<Content>First class hotel, Five class service My husband was in Hong Kong for business and I went with him. We stayed there for 3 very frustrating week. 1. It is a business hotel and they charge internet per machine (even though once u walk out, there is free WiFi connection). upon reviewing the weekly statement, we found out that there were many internet charges for one day. some days there are 3 or 4 internet charges (at flat rate 160HKD each). we questioned the front desk on friday and ask them to look into it. Sat whole day, no one get back to us. sun morning, they called us and asked if its ok to settle the weekly bill. we were like, there is still the charges pending... they said they will look into it. Sunday nite, the new invoice arrived, which i really cannot find the difference from the first one. so i raved down to the reception pointing out to them what is wrong. Their response is that I clicked the internet charges page too many times causing this error. i therefore asked them to give me a detail break down as to the time of these clicks. some of them happened at 6am in the morning which no one in our room was even up yet. so after pounding at them for an hour, they finally found out that their business center consistently and mistakenly, charge internet usage to our room for unknown (or no reasons). They overcharged us by about 200USD for the first two weeks. i spent 1 whole day going through pages of invoices for 2 weeks, line by line, trying to sort things out and ask them to reissue invoices (to claim company expense) and also check w the bank to ensure that that they charge the correct amount. All these could have been avoided if the hotel could just do their job and investigate immediately when received customer's complain. Also they should not have come up with such a complicated charging system if their staff and system cannot handle them. 2. I made reservations at the lobby lounge (in person) and showed them my room key card and they still manage to forget to take it down.3. all the magnetic card keys issued to us stop working on a Monday. we went to the front desk and they said that WE must have demagnetized the card (all 3 cards) at the same time. Later, we found out that in fact, that monday was our original check out date. The hotel staff forgot to update our room key cards. The motto of this hotel - CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS WRONG when they complain. This is not what i expect when i pay HKD 2900 per nite for a room.

<Content>World Class Just spent 7 nights in this amazing Hotel. We had booked a Hatbour View Executive floor room but we were upgraded to the most amazing suite of almost 1500 square feet. It had 2 large LCD TV's plus one in the bathroom. A steam room in the shower, a separate fully equipped kitchen and a huge living room/dining area - i have not experienced anything quite like it.The staff here were their usual impeccable selves, NOTHING is too much trouble and we were called by our names by everyone !Super service in the executive lounge, fantastic breakfast and snacks plus unlimited wine and champagne. The view of Victoria Harbour from the open air viewing deck on the 43rd floor is breath taking. This hotel is in my opinion 7 star. We will return again and agaim and again.

<Content>expect the usual luxury... :) Expect the usual luxury - everything one might want or need. Speciality soap and lotions in the bathroom, fabulous food in the restaurants, spa, pool, views, a very convenient mall right under the hotel, close ferries... But also expect to pay for it. Not sure if this is worth paying out of pocket, but when on a business trip... :-)

<Content>Great city hotel What can I say, everything you expect from a Four Seasons hotel - comfortable, modern room; great service; huge place; and the fantastic pool area was probably the highlight of the hotel. Difficult to find any negatives to be honest as everything was excellent, but i suppose with such a big place its not very cosy. Best hotel I've stayed in in Hong Kong.

<Content>"TRULY" 1st Class Our stay at the Four Seasons simply flowed from check in.The documents we had Fedex courier prior to our arrival were immediately handed to us at reception.The Harbour view from our suite had us relaxed from the momentwe opened the door.The pool/spa facilities are certainly some of the finest wehave enjoyed, even topping Burj al Arab's.The Room service menu was extensive and the fooddelivered was restaurant quality everytime.Having the IFC mall connected was a such a conveniencefor any high end shopping we wished to do during our stay,and the airport express train was effortless.We simply can not praise the hotel enough nor its incrediblypolite and professional staff.We have stayed at the Penninsula, and yes it is a grand old ladyindeed, but truly is no comparison to the Four Seasons..Book Dinner at Felix's or Gaddi's to experience the Penninsula but come home to the Four Seasons. It is a Hotel with Prestige and certainly worth the price.

<Content>Near Perfect The Four Seasons Hong Kong is located in the city鈥檚 business district and is conveniently connected to an the indoor mall (IFC). The Finance district is virtually connected to the hotel. I was able to walk to the Hang Seng stock exchange (through the nicely air conditioned indoor mall and corridors) in a few minutes. The Hong Kong (Central) MTR station is about two blocks away and so is the Star Ferry Pier should you want to catch a Ferry to Kowloon or even Macau. In general, the location is second to none especially for business travelers. If you fancy shopping then there are several high end shops (Harvey Nichols, Marks  Spencer) five minutes away by cab on nearby Queens Road. Cross into Kowloon and there are numerous brand name boutiques (Burberry, Prada, Harry Winston, Versace, Gucci, etc..) on Nathan Road and Canton Road.As for the dining, Caprice, Inagiku and the Pool Terrace Caf茅 are appetizing and the service was attentive yet unintrusive. The room service was prompt, my breakfast tea was always hot and my fresh fruit slightly chilled. The bed in the Harbour view suite was very inviting after being outside in the 32C temperature. In fact, the only thing the FS Hong Kong does not bring is ideal weather as it has been hot and humid outside for the week but the brilliance inside the hotel adequately makes up for the less than ideal conditions outside.

<Content>Perfection...exceeds all expectations. I think I can make this relatively brief because there are no words to describe the experience this hotel provides. They go above and beyond every other hotel we have stayed at in the Four Seasons chain (16) and we obviously love the chain. I considered staying at the Peninsula and visited and was very happy with the 4S choice. I liked the location much better, much fresher, and cleaner. You are attached to a very upscale mall, the airport express and all transportation options are steps away. Caprice was amazing and the staff went above and beyond all expectations. The spa is an experience not to be missed with treatment rooms overlooking the harbor. We had a 38th floor corner suite with harbour views, even from the tub. It was hard to leave for dinner when we went back to change, it was so beautiful. Hong Kong is a gorgeous city with so much to do. We slept with our curtains open b/c it was so beautiful at night and we were so excited to get up and explore every day. I dream of returning.

<Content>Amazing stay...even with a baby! We stayed at the Four Seasons for 2 nights en route from London to Perth. We were quite nervous about travelling with our 7 month old son for the first time and about how we would be received with a baby in an upmarket hotel. We needn't have worried! The staff at the Four Seasons were amazing and made our stay absolutely wonderful. The cot that was provided for our baby came complete with blue bumpers as he is a boy, a baby bath with complimentary Johnson's baby toiletries, nappies in the correct size and even a toy for him to play with. The staff were so welcoming and made such a fuss over our son. Our room was beautiful, we were upgraded to a Harbour View room which was fantastic and we ate in the Lounge both evenings and were warmly welcomed - the staff remembered our names from the first night and were fantastic with our son. Everything about this hotel was amazing, I would recommend it to everyone! The location is perfect, the concierge were very knowledgable and so helpful, the rooms are beautiful and every detail has been thought of. I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Best hotel in Hong Kong  We are seasoned travellers, fortunate to be able to experience high end standards and can be considered high maintenance.This hotel is simply outstanding. We stayed there for 10 days in February 2008 and found nothing other than perfection. Amazing rooms, public areas, swimming pool, spa, location, shops, food.Above all else, the staff are incredible.Not only does this hotel surpass the standards of the Peninsula and Mandarin Oriental (which are trading on their legacy / heritage rather than current service offering), but it is a contender for the greatest city hotel in the world.It's perfect.

<Content>Excellent stay It's my third time to stay Four Seasons Hong Kong. Everything is excellent. King size bed with very comfortable bed, marble rest room with L'Occitane line products and pool  jacuzzi with Victoria harbor view.Very few flaws but still have. Such as complimentary fruit is always not sweet and only one choice, orange even for 2 nights stay. Also, smoky taste in the breakfast dining area because it's a bar at the night...

<Content>The FS Hong Kong does not disappoint! My partner and I have wanted to stay at the FS Hong Kong ever since it opened. We made a special effort to modify our trip just to stay here. I do not have a great deal to add since there have been so many reviews, but I can say it is an exceptional hotel in many ways. When you enter the hotel, you are greeted by an army of employees who all move with precision. The lobby is rather understated and unimpressive yet there are even more employees there to address any need you may have. We stayed in a corner executive suite. It was tastefully decorated, well laid out and very impressive. The view of the harbor is magnificent. The pool area was as beautiful as the pictures on the website appear. The most enjoyable part of the hotel was having access to the executive lounge. The complimentary breakfast was not large but had great service and food that was superb. We ate at the Chinese restaurant in the hotel and found the service to be once again very efficient and the food was excellent. The attached mall is very upscale and convenient. The service level was outstanding for the most part. It was remarkably efficient. The staff was polite but not warm and friendly. This is not surprising considering it is a world class business hotel. On our first morning, we went out to the pool area and were completely ignored by the staff. I called the guest experience manager to complain. She was very apologetic and vowed to take action. When we returned to the pool an hour later, the service level improved dramatically. The manger of the pool area apologized profusely and offered us free drinks. I appreciated that my concerns were addressed and all was forgiven. We splurged and booked the Aqua Suite in the spa. It was an amazing experience. We had over an hour to enjoy the shower, daybed and terrific view of the harbor. Our massages were some of the best we have had. In some ways, the FS Honk Kong can offer the best of both worlds: It is a great business hotel with the feel of a resort. The spa, pool and gym will undoubtedly give the busy executive a respite from the job and the weekend visitor an escape in an exotic location

<Content>A hotel for the seasoned traveller. We stayed in one of the deluxe suites at this hotel for one night. The room was massive - dining area, sitting area, bedroom, bathroom and kitchen altogether must have been well over 800 sq.ft. The experience was typically polished - crisp, clean bedsheets; soft towels with plenty of toiletries from Bulgari; welcome tea; turn-down service........So altogether a comfortable and competent experience, though a bit characterless. I must say that I do judge asian hotels with higher standards, knowing that I would expect to receive a lower standard of service at many equivalent European hotels.Something that irritated me was the fact that they charged for mini-bar items and even HK$160 for 24 hours of internet access! Surely these should be included in the rates at this price range. This also betrays a lack of class in the operation of this hotel sadly.

<Content>great hotel, few flaws the four seasons is everything the other reviewers say and more. a great hotel in a great location with impeccable amenities and lovely facilities. the rooms are beyond reproach in terms of space and taste although if you are used to international luxury this is what many people nowadays expect.in terms of styling it is brilliantly done with a magnificent lobby and the enticing blue bar that has a nice jazz band on thu, fri and sat.two things bothered me:- when asking for a late checkout, i was told they could only do it until one pm when i am used to much lesser hotels offering me at least 2, 3 and even 4 pm without charge. i think they lied when they said they were very busy to do so since they did indicate that i could have a late checkout if i paid the extra charges that i didn't even care to find out how much.- the concierge did not make a good enough effort to arrange for my bags to be picked up and taken to the entrance of the express train checkin counters that are almost next door where i could do some shopping and meet their porter there. this service was provided last time to us by the lesser quality and older JW marriott hong kond and when i said so they said we dont do that. what happened to being resourceful?i think that the hotel is not to be missed and service is always with a smile and brilliantly a hallmark of the four seasons but the two issues above showed me that they sometimes are not willing to go the extra length to truly make you happy.relevant disclosure: we were paying at least 40,000 hong kong dollars per night with five harbor view rooms for almost a week and i just needed the late checkout for two of those rooms.

<Content>Always Just Perfact I have stayed at the Four Seasons a few times and everytime the experience has been just GREAT. Service is impeccable, the rooms are spacious, modern and the bathrooms are the best i've ever seen at a hotel. Try and get a harbour view room if you can. Great location located on central island and linked to the shopping mall IFC which has a bunch of great restautrants (Harlams, Ina giko ) and great bars (red, G-bar)Knowledgable concierge, helpful staff, great restaurant, faboulous spa,....in short no matter what you are looking for you just can't go wrong with the Four Seasons in Hong Kong.

<Content>Fantastic experience We loved this hotel. Only premier deluxe rooms available when we booked but I think any room here would have been great. It is well worth paying the extra for the executive level access. The pool, spa and gym were fantastic. The restaurant Caprice was also beautiful, and the staff were terrific. The MTR airport express is below the IFC. Will not stay anywhere else in HK now.

<Content>Amazing Hotel, As Good as it gets The Four Seasons Hong Kong is without a doubt one the top hotels in Hong Kong and in the world. You simply cannot go wrong.I stayed there four four night during this past easter. - Location: The hotel is located in the IFC Mall, in Hong Kong Central. The Airport Express train go right into Hong Kong station (located in the mall), so when you arrive, the hotel is about a 5minute walk indoors from the train. In addition to the many stores offered at the IFC Mall, there is a movie theater, many restaurants and a supermarket. Also easily accessible at the Ferry piers (Star Ferry to Kowloon, Ferry the Lantau, Macau...). It takes about a 5-10 minute walk through the mall to reach the Ferry piers. The view on the bay is also amazing (though not as great as that from Kowloon facing Hong Kong central). If the view is really important to you, The Peninsula will probably offers nicer view of the high risers.Also, since most of the nightlife happens on the Central side, the hotel is a good location for clubbing. Most clubs are located withina 10-minute walk (on passageways and pedestrian bridges) away.- Service: As expected from a Four Seasons. The check-in process was quick. Reception was friendly and welcomed us with a smile.The concierge service was also very helpful and the many concierges made great suggestions for places to visit and restaurants. On several occasions, the restaurants we asked for were booked - I would have hoped the concierge staff would have certain connectionsallowing them better access to tables. - Rooms: Room was very spacious, with a large marble bathroom. The hotel was openned two years ago, so everything in it is brand new. All rooms have a huge glass window (floor to ceiling).- Amenities: The fitness center has a view on the harbour and is equipped with all the imagineable machines. The fitness is well- above average given that it is also open to members as a stand alone gym club.The hotel has two outdoor swimming pools with great view of the skyscrapers and Kowloon. The main swimming pool (heated) actually give the impression of diving straight into the bay. Other reviews mentioned the music under water - this really is a gimmick - since when you swim, you cannot really hear the music.- Food: We really did not eat much at the hotel. On room-service order was delivered very quickly, the food was good. We tried the Chinese breakfast restaurant one morning, the food was very good again. Afternoon tea was also good.- Room for Improvement: Internet access should be free (160HKD). The heated swimming-pool could be slightly warmer.

<Content>Stunning hotel with excellent service I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The hotel itself is stunning, with beautiful, well-equipped and modern rooms. It has a great location, next to the IFC, with shops and transport very close by. Service was very efficient throughout my 3 day stay and the gym and spa facilities were excellent. Food in the Lounge and Chinese restaurant was also excellent.

<Content>AMAZING EXPERIENCE This is one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. A beautiful new hotel building, wonderful one bedroom suite, stunning views from our room and the VIP lounge, and excellent service. Combining our experience at the Four Seasons with visits to the other two highly recommended Hong Kong hotels - Peninsula  InterContinental - left us with no doubt whatsoever that we made the right choice.

<Content>WOW Great great hotel. We only stayed 2 nights and that was not enough. Hotel is spectacular, rooms are wonderful with a view of Victoria Harbor. Spend the extra money and stay at the executive club. Breakfast is included, afternoon snacks, and a view that is incredible. Hotel is all about service. From the moment you arrive in Hong Kong airport you are met by a Four Seasons employer who is holding your name and the next thing we knew he was whisking us through customs and directly to a chauffered car outside. Same for when you leave. They took us to the train station, which was a 5 minute ride from the hotel, we checked in with our passports/boarding passes - we were walked onto the train and 35 minutes later we were at Hong Kong airport. We can't wait to return to this hotel.

<Content>WOW When we were planing a stop over for 3 nights on the way home from NZ it was toss up between the Four Seasons  the Peninsular. and wow we made the right choice. The hotel room was wonderful with a breath taking view of Victoria Harbour the room was a executive harbour view room we decided to stay at the executive club and what a treat it was I would strongly reccomend to anyone looking for that special touch to book a room with executive club access the club lounge over looks Victoria harbour and the light show is a spectacle every evening. The additional cost of the executive club gives you access to fullBreakfast, snacks, drinks ,all day alcohol from 11am to 1am afternoon tea and light dinner snacks the choice of food and drinks are amazing and are truly unlimited the service throughout the hotel is impecable. We have stayed at the Peninsular Bejing and thought that was good, but the Four Seasons puts it to shame. Fantastic location, very well trained staff to pamper your every whim. A Truly Amazing Experience

<Content>Hotel Standards Hit New High at the FS HK If there were a heaven on earth, the Four Seasons Hong Kong tries to replicate it, with a combination of excellent d茅cor, impeccable service, wonderful food and facilities in the heart of one of the world's most exciting cities. Hong Kong has great hotels, but this is one of the few hotels in the world where I would actually like to LIVE. A friend does indeed live there, and she loves it. And what's not to love? I arrived after a long flite from Europe to be the only one on the plane to be greeted by a person holding my name and a cart directly outside the plane, whisking me off through customs and directly to the luggage belt. As soon as I was picked up, I didn't even see another of my flight companions again, I was taken directly to my chauffered car outside and whisked to the hotel, where the wonderful front desk service took me to my room for check in where I had the best view of Hong Kong's night-time panorama. Never in my life have I experienced such excellent service, particularly welcome after a long flight (the Mandarin is similar, but chauffers appear only after you exit airport customs carrying your own luggage). The room had been redecorated, and superbly. I had a more classic, modern room which is precisely to my taste. The hotel is just a bridge (through a great mall) to the centre of the city and my office. However, I loved the short distance which allowed me to unwind after the intensity that is Hong Kong. Loved the state of the art gym and spa. I have travelled, it seems, nearly everywhere but this is one of my two favourite hotel properties on the planet. The other is the George V in Paris. Highly recommended.

<Content>Elegant Wonderful stay over new year's holiday. A few thoughts: The harbor view is magnificent, but the city view is equally stunning. Drinks are extraordinarily expensive in Hong Kong, but the executive lounge pours complimentary drinks (and high quality champagne) virtually all day and that, alone, makes booking the executive floor worthwhile. The breakfast buffet in the executive lounge is also wonderful, although not as opulent as the one at Cafe Too at the Island Shangri-La (few things are). The hotel spa is perhaps the best I've visited anywhere. Sky bridges connect the hotel to the Central district and the new Star Ferry is moments away via walkways. Staff was wonderfully helpful and gracious. This has become one of my favorite hotels in the world.

<Content>Is this the best city hotel in the world? This has to be the best city hotel in the world.The rooms are fantastic.The location amazing (views on the harbour and linked to the IFC mall directly).The service is absolutely in every single way faultless, any requests arrive at your door within 5 minutes.I could list for hours how well this hotel serves you and still not do it justice. The staff are all efficient, knowledgable and pre-empt requests before they have even been made.The food is fantastic (breakfast and room service menu).The spa is one of the best I have ever seen, the treatment rooms overlooking the harbour complete it.The pool and gym are also aurplus to anyone's requirements.Even the most difficult and discerning traveller would not fail to be amazed at the standards this hotel offers. It trumps the George IV and the Four Seasons New York...

<Content>Great hotel, avoid Exec Club We stayed at this hotel a few years ago when it first opened. At that time I assumed the Service problems on the Executive Club floor were only the growing pains of a brand new hotel. Apparently not....years later, the service on the Exec floor is slow and inefficient. During cocktail hour, I have never seen SO many waiters do SO little SO slowly.At breakfast time the number of tables available was completely and utterly insufficient for the number of people who wanted to eat! The hotel should either add more tables or allow Club members to use room service as a complimentary alternative.Having criticized the Club floor to bits, I'd now like to state that the rest of the hotel is gorgeous. The rooms are large (by HK standards) with LOTS of storage, cushy beds, wifi, massive TV, minibar, kettle, great bathrooms with seperate tub and shower stall, and wonderful floor to ceiling windows. The pool has a wonderful view....I assume you're not going to HK to tan, but if you are, be advised the sun goes behind adjacent building after 2 pm.Check-in can be dicey: we were kept waiting for our room from 4 pm to 6:30 pm upon arrival.....given we used the hotel car and thus the hotel knew when we were arriving it is a puzzle how they could get it so wrong. I found the best rates for this hotel on the hotel website. When we stay here again we'll book a room ONLY....the Executive Club is not worth the extra $$ given the inconveniences, slow service and inadequate facilities.

<Content>5 Star PLUS This hotel is a true 5 star PLUS and is well representative of the Four Seasons chain. The hotel is located write next to the train station which takes you to Kowloon in one stop and the airport in 24 minutes. It is also attached to One IFC which has shops and restaurants. Additionally a ferry to Kowloon is also within easy reach. The rooms were very large with the bathroom the size of many hotel rooms in 5 star hotels. Very comfortable beds, good quality ammenities (L'octaine), fluffy towels and great views.The health club and pool were fantastic and top quality.We did not eat any food in the hotel due to the endless options surrounding the hotel.All in all an excellent business hotel right near Exchange Square, great for one night stopover as we did as well as those wanting to see the city.

<Content>The best on Hong Kong I just got back from a week on business and stayed at the four seasons.It was so clean and the service was great.I stayed on the 30th floor overlooking the harbor.excellent room.They have a club on the 45th floor for breakfast and lite dinner.They gave us a meeting room for free.The shuttle to the airport is under the hotel. Take that! 15 minutes.Driving is 45 minutes.The ferry to Kowloon is 20 cents and it is in front of the hotel.The restaurants are very expensive and not worth it.I would rate it 5 star.B Pratt

<Content>Excellent hotel The Four Seasons Hong Kong is part of the ifc which also includes a mall with a large selection of shops and restaurants and several office buildings. The airport express and the metro station Central are directly connected to the ifc. The shopping areas of Central and a large number of bars and pubs in Lan Kwai Fong and Soho are within easy walking distance.The rooms are very spacious, modern, nicely decorated and quiet. A huge flat panel TV with DVD player is available. The large desk is equipped with internet connection, multiple socket and adapter plugs. The very large bathrooms have a separate shower and a tub with an LCD TV.The hotel bar provides an extensive breakfast buffet in the morning. Alternatively, made-to-order breakfast is served in the restaurant. In both cases the quality of the food was excellent.The service at the Four Seasons was excellent, and all staff were extraordinarily friendly. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This is about as good as a city hotel can get. The rooms are very spacious with amenities such as a a large flat-screen TV and a flat-screen TV in the bathroom, very nicely furninshed etc, etc. I can not find a single thing to complain about.Service is excellent, prompt and to very high standards.The only drawback is the location, in the IFC mall. Great if you are into shopping but if not, it is a bit of a walk to more interesting places.No point in asking for a sea-view room, they overlook a part of the HK harbour that is not that scenic.

<Content>Loved it loved it loved it It's one of the newest hotels in Hong Kong and it did not fail to impress me. The rooms are generously sized, ipod docking station, and L'Ocitanne amenities. I've stayed at Island Shangri-la as well and Four Seasons is now a tough competitor. Specially since the rooms are much more of the modern and contemporary style. Service was impeccable and food was great! Only down side is that the bar closes too early for my liking :)

<Content>Four Seaons - SIX STARS PLUS a whole lot more..... I normally don鈥檛 write letters after my stay at hotels but thought I should express my appreciation of this property and the guest experience I hadFrom my arrival unannounced at the limo desk to my check out at 630 am two days later there is no thing I can fault about the hotelIt is clear that the trainers, management team and staff have a serious commitment to guests and the servicethey offer is one of the highest I have ever experienced at any hotel in the worldI have stayed at over 100 properties in the 5 and 6 start category and Four season Hong Kong stands out as the best (and I mean compared to all the peninsula, and Ritz Carlton, tajs and orient express, oriental, brands ....)The executive lounge team deserve special mention as they simply know how to make you feel at home, looked after me and pre-empt even my my smallest request with a smile and commitmentThe Spa team are equally talented and the concierge were superb. House keeping just turn up before you hang up the phone to press your shirt or tidy up before your meeting....The breakfasts I ate in the lounges were again the highest standard I have been served for years in a hotel with all dishes equally fresh and great ingredientsI guess I just wanted to say that you should happily pay the premium thsi chain charges for the service alone you get great value and the roosm are lush plsuh and like you never wnat to leave.... you will always find me recommending this hotel to all my clinets friends and industry colleagues.

<Content>Great place when visiting Hong Kong We stayed at this hotel over new year and were absolutely amazed by the room, ambiance and service. This is yet another example of Four Seasons delivering on high quality!Rooms are very large, modern and elegant with every necessary (and unnecessary) imaginable amenity with great views of the harbour. The same comments are applicable across all of the rest of the hotel with a wide selection of restaurants, bars and easy access to a large shopping mall and subway.As we were visiting such an exciting location, we did not really spend time lounging by the pool, but did visit the poolside bar on a couple of evenings. The pool / bar area has absolutely amazing views - not to be missed !!Whilst we were in Hong Kong we took the chance to not only visit the traditional sights on Hong Kong but also some of the other hotels. From what we saw, I would definately rate the Four Seasons as the choice location when staying in Hong Kong

<Content>Wonderful. The best hotel ever! This was our second stay at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong, but hopefully not our last. Great sized rooms, very attentive staff, food in the bars and restaurants was great, pool is beautiful, the day spa is wonderful. Yes, it's expensive, but absolutely well worth it for a few days of luxury. I was delighted that the hotel gave me a birthday cake as it was my birthday while we were there.

<Content>Usual Four Seasons Excellence This is yet another great Four Seasons hotel that exceeds expectations in many ways. I was in Hong Kong and Singapore in June, and I was lucky enough to stay at this hotel while attending a conference. Thank you to all the staff for looking after me and my wife so well.The rooms and bathrooms leave very little to be desired. They are big, very comfortable and luxuriously appointed. The public areas are tastefully decorated. I visited all the restaurants and bars in the hotel (including the Executive Club floor which we had access to), and was never disappointed with the quality or service. The infinity pool is out of this world. Apart from the great view, one cannot but admire the beauty of the pool itself. As if the main pool (with its underwater music) was not large enough, there is a separate pool, which is shallower and presumably for younger guests.The spa is fantastic. You don't have to book a treatment to enjoy the amazing service and facilities (sauna, steam room, huge jaccuzi, etc) of the changing area.The only problem I can see with this hotel is the slightly tricky approach for taxis and people on food. It takes a while to get to grips with directions to the hotel.If you're into shopping, one of the biggest and best shopping malls in East Asia can be reached directly from one of the entrances/exits.I don't think you can go wrong if you choose this hotel for your stay in Hong Kong.

<Content>Fabulous What can I say. This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at.The rooms are spacious, modern, light, technologically up to date.The view from the rooms is good, not great but this has all to do with the fact that one sees only the west side of Kowloon where there are some nice highrise buildings but nothing compared to the ones in the center.The swimming pools are well located. There is always someone available for a dry towel or a glass of cool water.Staff is extraordinary friendly, from the doorman to the cleaning lady. They all make you feel at home.Breakfast was good though not great. Maybe the fact that we were among the last to have breakfast could have been the cause of it.Unfortunately we could only stay two days. But we will surely be back.

<Content>Impeccable Service and Quality We have stayed in many five star properties, including several Four Seasons properties and this was perhaps the best hotel experience we have ever had. Our stay was flawless.We had pre-arranged a transfer from the airport. As we exited the jetway, we saw a man holding a sign with our name at the gate. He was very friendly and helpful. He led us to customs and, after we cleared customs, we found him waiting on the other side with all of our baggage. I have no idea how he managed to do this as we did not give him any information about our bags or the luggage tags. Upon arrival, a friendly concierge was waiting out front for us. She led us directly to our room where we completed check in. We were celebrating an anniversary and a complimentary bottle of champagne and miniature wedding cake were waiting for us in our room (additionally delicious treats were left for us every night). I mentioned we wanted to change a dinner reservation and add an extra night to our reservation. Within 10 minutes, the concierge had everything arranged including changing our reservation with the Four Seasons Marunouchi in Tokyo. The room itself was very spacious and had a beautiful view of the harbour. Considering it was a standard room, I was shocked at the spaciousness of both the room and bathroom. The bathroom was gorgeous. The closet space was also phenomenal.The property is gorgeous. The pool is one of the nicest I have seen. Very clean and has a gorgeous view. The poolside bar/restaurant service was very good. The spa was gorgeous and the treatments excellent. While the hotel restaurants are very expensive, the food and service are of excellent quality. We had a very memorable meal at Caprice.The hotel is well located. The hotel is within walking distance of the Ferry Terminal and located next to wonderful shopping. The hotel is part of the IFC complex which has many wonderful shops, coffee shops, a nice grocery store and restaurants.The concierge team was phenomenal. They provided excellent recommendations for dining, shopping and activities. During our stay, my wife became very ill. Within five minutes of my calling the front desk, a British doctor was on his way to our room. She received excellent treatment and the staff could not have been kinder. When we had follow-up questions about the medication he prescribed, the hotel staff had him on the phone within 3 minutes. As well, it was uncertain if she would be able to fly as scheduled and the staff offered to change all our hotel and airline reservations for us. We would be thrilled to return to this property anytime and would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>OK but not that great I attended a conference here last week, and despite it being way beyond my corporate budget, was able to stay here.When I arrived the front desk had no record of my reservation but the girl on the desk was able to rescue the situation and put me in a Harbour View Room for the same price as the attempted booking for the Peak View Room, so a mixed start.The hotel, in common with other Four Seasons I have stayed at (Jakarta and Taipei spring to mind) comes across as a cold design, too much marble, high ceiling-ed public areas: all very impressive but not welcoming.Staff were professional and courteous, and I'd say pretty good.The room was OK, obviously quite large and modern decor, great view of the harbour (but the weather was rubbish the whole week!), flat screen TV, cool flat screen in the bathroom behind the mirror, but again, not welcoming. Bed was nothing special IMHO.Room service took 30 mins to deliver a steak sandwich: I asked for it medium rare (which it was, to be fair) but it would only take 3 mins to cook, what were they doing for the other 27?I left the room at 8 each morning and at lunch time went back for a small post lunch kip and each time, the room had not been made up, which I found surprising.Possibly this was the conference organisers' idea but lunch each day was a buffet, that's OK but there were no places to sit and eat, just stand around balancing plates! Also, the food was no great shakes.I had one other meal, breakfast on the first morning: great Eggs Benedict, but eyewatering price...Overall, a lot of money, over USD400 and I'm just not sure it was that good.

<Content>Excellent location and good quality Stayed here on business for 8 nights in Feb 2007. This hotel is in a fantastic location, right next to the IFC mall, near the escalators to the mid-levels, and next to the Star Ferry and hydrofoil to Macau. It is not a very touristy hotel, it caters mostly to business travelers. The room was spacious and the bed comfortable. The shower and bathroom were also large and of excellent quality. As with all of the 4S that I have stayed in, the room was equipped with flat screen TV, DVD player, and large desk. The concierge was very helpful, booking us on a Chinese New Years excursion and also giving us directions and help as necessary. All of the staff were extremely well trained and friendly. From day to day, the doormen would remember our prior day's excursions and inquire as to how we enjoyed them.The service in the room was very good, but obtrusive. The doorbell rang consistently, everything from simply asking how we were to refilling the fruit in the bowl to turndown, etc. I should have put on the do not disturb but have honestly never been disrupted as often as I was at any hotel. The reason that this hotel receives a 4 instead of a 5 is room service. The service was wonderful but the food was lacking in variety and quality and was extremely pricey. Traveling on business, I use room service far more frequently than when leisure traveling so this was a concern for me.

<Content>We Adored It We absolutely adored our three nights at the Four Seasons Hong Kong. After spending two weeks on the mainland, walking into the white marble lobby was like entering heaven. Our room was the Deluxe Harbor View Room. One wall was solid windows and though it did not face the middle of the harbor, it was great fun to watch the constant activity in the bay. The room was not huge, but perfectly appointed. Loads of slick built in storage space, a huge TV, and a Four Seasons Bed. We were given the modern room as opposed to the Asian Room and were very happy. The bathroom was huge with loads of marble and a TV to watch from the tub.The service was top notch. The concierge suggested perfect child friendly activities, shopping, routes and restaurants. At one point my watch went missing (it had fallen in a crack in the safe) and they sent up the hotel detective and a helper to assist us.The food at the lobby restaurant was posatively delicious and service extremely attentive. Perhaps it was because I had been only eating Chinese food for the two weeks prior, but the Caesar Salad and Chardonay tasted better than usual. The Filet with Bernaise sauce would also outstanding (we kept ordering it). The food is very expensive, but seemed worth the price, service and the level of quality. Room service servings were quite tiny and just OK. You can't miss the rooftop pool for lap swimming (with music played underwater) while watching the boats go by. It was very enjoyable.I look forward to returning to this fine hotel.

<Content>It's good, but is it really a Four Seasons? Stayed in the Four Seasons HK recently on a stopover. It is part of the ultra-modern IFC complex which includes office towers and a seriously upmarket shopping mall. The whole place looks modern and sleek. The IFC also includes Hong Kong station - with the Airport Express and in-town check-in for air travellers. In a nutshell, the Four Seasons' location for business travellers and shoppers is just about unbeatable in HK.Check-in was efficient and front desk staff spoke English fluently. Most other staff speak English very well. Service throughout the hotel was efficient and courteous. We got a large room with a view of Kowloon and the harbour. Unfortunately dreary weather rather spoilt the effect. The room itself (and the rest of the hotel) is designed and furnished in the modern style - although hardly minimalist. Your mileage may vary - it doesn't really appeal to me. Broadband internet and your usual array of different wall sockets are available as one would expect in a top hotel. Separate shower and toilet stalls and twin sinks in the bathroom are welcome features. The gym is large and very well equipped with weights and machines.This hotel is huge - especially by Four Seasons standards. For me, all this means that service - although excellent and faultless - lacks the personalised touch that you find in other Four Seasons properties. The hotel is simply too big - it's more like a Hilton or a Grand Hyatt perhaps?The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is outstanding - it has perhaps the best dim sum you can find in Hong Kong. And perhaps the world. Reservations are a good idea.Overall, this is an outstanding hotel that ticks every box. It is expensive - even by HK standards, but for offers much for its high prices.

<Content>Sleek, Sophisticated and Excellent service My partner and i recently stayed at the FSHK for five nights in a Deluxe Harbour View room. We were very impressed with the service from all staff and found all aspects of this hotel to be of a very high standard. We opted for the limousine service from the airport (which is certainly worth doing), we were met off the plane and escorted through baggage and security to the car and our luggage was handled for us.The concierge are very helpful, staff at Blue Bar are also friendly and attentive. We were made to feel very special but the staff were never intrusive. My partner used the Spa and thoroughly enjoyed it, the pool area is fantastic and again the service was fantastic.The room was clean, of high quality with great views and the evening turndown service is a nice touch. Only minor points are that the tv in the bathroom is slightly useless as it is too high when you sit in the bath so the picture is distorted, and there is no DVD library, only some for children. However, we were not there to watch television and the overall experience was fantastic. I would recommend this hotel to any traveller whether they are there on business or for leisure.

<Content>absolutely fabulous Just came back from a 4 night stay at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong and it's been one of the best hotel experiences I ever had.Check in: Quick and efficient. On the way up to the room we were told that we got an upgrade to an executive suite with harbour views because of a full house. We didnt complain!.Room: Great size, beautiful views. Excellent bathroom, great bedsheets.Service: Second to none, staff addressed us by name. Staff are very friendly and went out of their way to accommodate us..Breakfast: Excellent.Gym and Pool: Good size gym with new equipment and again, great views. Beautiful and heated pool - perfect to swim laps early morning or late at night, followed by a dip in the hot tub.. Bar and Restaurants: Tried the Blue Bar and Caprice - I really enjoyed our dinner at Caprice - delicious food, staff were extremely friendly without being intrusive.Overall, we had a fantastic stay here. We were looked after as if we were VIP's in the true sense of the word. Hopefully we'll be back.

<Content>WOW, really amazing Just stayed two days and nights at the Four Season Hong Kong. I thought that the Mandarin Hong Kong was already very good, but the Four Season was just perfect. The view from the room was just incredible, the room immaculate in a perfect design. Beautiful bathroom with separate showe cabin and Flat screen tv above the bath tub.The swimming pool is also very nice, in one of the pools, one can enjoy a nice bath and at the same time overview the whole of Victoria Harbour. Before leaving, i tried out the spa as well which is very well appointed though I was practically on my own for nearly the whole of two hours.

<Content>no complaints We stayed 3 nights at the end of Feb and thought the hotel was spot on. Staff very helpful, though a little brusque in that Chinese way, room service on time, room beautiful with spectacular views. Excellent large gym, coffee, juice on offer in the mornings. The pool is a real jaw dropper, looking over to Kowloon one way  to the financial district the other - warm too. Didn't eat at the restaurants, but duck shephards pie from room service was the definition of comfort food. The kitsch over opulent aesthetic of tourist faves like the Peninsular with its camp bell boys and shops doesn't really crisp my personal bacon, so it's great to have somewhere like the 4S as an alternative.

<Content>not there yet. after staying and dining at all the 5 star hotels in hong kong over the years, i decided its time to check out the new four seasons hotel in hk. i've heard conflicting comments from friends of mine who have stayed at the property during the past year. the lobby area is kinda sparse, with not much of a focal point. the check in and concierge counters were off to the side and the low ceilings kinda make the area feel cramped (as the lobby has a 4 storey height to it).service was quick, efficient but was cold and without much of a four seasons touch. its as if they are there to get you in and out asap... maybe thats how they want it to be seen - an efficient biz type like hotel - again, this is not a four seasons trait. the other better four seasons that i've stayed in, offers a gracious charm to it, efficient but filled with care and warmth. diligent attention and an opening to get u what u want and beyond that, get u who u didn't know u want. fs george v in paris does that so well. thats the benchmark of all four seasons should be compared to.room was alright, a bright blend of east and west, views were quite good, if its a clear day, otherwise, u'll be looking out to a grey harbor. the funny thing is that the apartment block next to the hotel, which i understand is also managed by the four seasons in hk, offers much better harbor views. rooms at the apartment block faces more towards the central and causeway bay direction, while the hotel block faces more towards tsim sha tsui west and the macau ferry terminal. if you are looking for the room with the best harbor view from hong kong side, this is not it. the harbor view rooms at the grand hyatt, shangri-la, conrad offers better views.i checked out the dining facilities at the hotel during the stay and had dinner at both the french and chinese restaurant. since the executive chef at the caprice came from le cing of george v paris, i expect a great meal. alas, that was not the case. quite disappointed is my feeling. service was like the check in - fast and furious. its as if they were trying to outdo each other in trying to get the table turned. saw a waiter breaking some glasses that was placed in the long glass cabinet placed in the middle of the restaurant. the rush rush rush feel doesn't do it for me in a french restaurant, especially with staff from george v paris running the place. i spoke to the manager of the restaurant and made him aware of my observations and he concurred. he is definitely not happy with the level of service being offered. as for the food, i'm a frequent guest at le cinq, and the food at caprice is not a true reflection of what it is in paris. guess something has lost itself in the translation of the cooking. i understand that the executive chef from le cinq visited the restarurant a while back and was quite disappointed with the level of food. efforts have been made to rectify that problem but i still don't see it as even offering the best french fine dining in hong kong. gaddi's at the pen is still the best in this aspect. so much for my french fine dining.the chinese restaurant was modern, silverish grey in color and a bit cold. just like most of the staff at the hotel, the four seasons touch just doesn't show itself. one thing i've noticed is that many of the staff seems to be a bit distance and acting cool. thats again, not a four seasons trait - cool is just not four seasons. four seasons is all about warmth, openess, and willingness to aid and get the guest feeling top of the world.food at the chinese restaurant came in pretty dainty size offerings, doesn't make the dining experience that great, as i was with a group of friends that all made comments that we need to double what we ordered. guess thats what management decided to go with. again, i was disappointed with the chinese food, as i can get much better fare at many great chinese restauratns in hong kong. if one needs just to entertain in central, i guess fs hk is an alright choice. if u need to entertain with great food, this is not the place to go.the swimming pool area was pretty nice (located at and angle facing tsim sha tsui and wanchai), especially at nite and deserted. the shimmering lights of hong kong harbor and kowloon is always great to check out. for any travellers with friends with american club membership, u should check out the nite scene of hk from the club's city location - located in side 2 exchange square, 49th floor).all in all, fs hk is a middle of the road four seasons, with much lacking befitting a city like hong kong. it doesn't come close to the other great four seasons around the world. i place it on the same level as the four seasons in singapore and sydney, albeit in a brand spanking new building. and way way behind the four seasons flagship, four season george v paris.

<Content>Hong Kong's finest Having stayed at the 4 seasons several times (including my wedding night!), this is without doubt my fav hotel in HK. The place is still gleaming, as the hotel only opened in late 2005. The 4 seasons is based on a sleek contemporary design, as opposed to the Peninsula鈥檚 old world grandeur. The rooms are spacious, with a huge bathrooms and good showers. Also great complimentary toiletries by L'Occitane - always a sign of a good hotel. No cheap soap here!Situated within the IFC mall complex, the 4 seasons is easy to get to from the Central airport express station, which is just a 10 minute walk away through the mall. We normally use the free car drop-off service on our return to the airport express terminal.Highlights:- Fantastic roof-top outdoor pool with one of the world's most spectacular views across HK harbour.- Contemporary (free) Jacuzzi, steam room and Spa, which never seems to be too busy and is a great place to unwind. Feels like you are in a proper spa, rather than a hotel.- Well appointed, large rooms with great views and facilities. - Excellent service from all staff, who have been trained to the highest degree. Unlike some 5* hotels, the atmosphere is not stuffy.Criticisms (I am nit-picking here):- Being in the heart of Central, the 4 seasons is less well located for visiting Wan Chai (which has a huge selection of places to eat). The Central area is a bit dead at night. The Star Ferry terminal is located close by, making access to Kowloon easy.- I do find the decor in the Chinese styled rooms a little over-the-top and cluttered. Maybe im more of a minimalist.- There is often a strong smell of Cigar smoke when entering the foyer in the evening, as the main bar is open to the foyer. Aside from putting up a wall, im not sure what can be done? Being a non-smoker, I do find this a bit unpleasant.Overall, a great place to stay and one i will definately seek out on my next trip to HK.

<Content>Great view Booked hotel through British Airways website  got really good price for superior room with view over the harbour-worth it just for the view. Room was spacious  furniture new, as hotel was opened only a year ago. The bathroom was vast, with marble everywhere, walk in shower, huge bath with a TV above. When we arrived at hotel, greeted by army of porters, who quickly unloaded our luggage, which was swiftly delivered to our room, while we checked in. Service was excellent, with staff eager to please.We did not breakfast at hotel, as quite pricey. However, we treated ourselves to afternoon tea in restaurant, which is highly recommended. Concierge services were good-they can recommend  book local restaurants, trips etc. We took advantage of free transfer to airport check in facilities near to hotel. Recommend taking train to airport-fast  clean  much quicker  cheaper than bus or private transfers. Only niggle was that our ironing (pressing) order was late in being delivered  we had to phone for it. It was also expensive. No iron or board in room.

<Content>We cannot wait to go back. We had asked for the limosine service to collect us from the airport. Outstanding.We had booked the executive floor but was upgraded to an executive suite. Superb. The view of the harbour was stunning and the rooms were so quiet.The executive floor was possibly the best we had experienced in the world. If we had a criticism , it was that the occasional member of staff in the executive longe was sometimes a little stuffy. However perhaps they had never seen anyone consume so much champagne in such a short time!We had read rave reviews about Lung King Heen restaurant at the hotel which we booked before we came out but which we found not to our taste ,all other restaurants we tried in the hotel were excellent. Breakfast in the executive club was first class and never too busy.This visit was at the end of a two month holiday and although all accomodation during our trip was booked on a 5 star basis this hotel really was the icing on the cake and the staff of many of the hotels we stayed in could learn from visiting this hotel. Thank You.

<Content>Great place! Terrific hotel. Location, service and food is faultless.The rooms are spacious by today's standards and the attention to detail was excellent. They took care of us (including 6 year old) in world class style. The in-house French restaurant is truly out of this world but book WAY in advance if you wish a table near the windows to enjoy the view. Only negative was VERY small capacity for breakfast. The two rooms available are much too small for the hotel's capacity and the nicer of the two is full most mornings. The other is fine but the concept of having to wait for breakfast at a Four Seasons is a bit strange.

<Content>Absolutely perfect Arriving at the Four Seasons Hong Kong after an extended business trip through China was like making it to heaven. World Class service, flawless and quiet rooms with incredible views. The concierge service met my every request promptly and efficiently. The staff at the bar breakfast buffet could not have been more friendly. The restaurant Capirce, while pricey, was a pure French dining experience with the food and service quality meritting the prices. I would happily return over and over again to this wonderful refuge

<Content>It was good We stayed for about 12 days in the peak view room of Four Seasons. Must say that it was a good experience. The Plasma TV in the bathroom was a definitely great, it was amongst the best things in the room. The hotel is centrally located with beautiful views. The service in general was good, though not very warm. What I did not like as much was the decor of the rooms. It completely lacked color. It was not a very warm or welcoming room to come back to.However .... I understand to each his own...some people must like it. Overall I would say it was a good experience. I am not sure if I would come back to Four Seasons...I would rather try some other hotel....like the new Mandarin...because there was nothing exceptional that would get me back.

<Content>The best hotel in Hong Kong We stayed at the Four Seasons Hong Kong for one night under the Urban Renewal Spa Package. We had just spent 1 month holidaying in Europe and the US, which included stays at hotels including FS in New York and Vegas. Let me say that Four Seasons in Hong Kong is WOW and anyone who complains about its price obviously has never stayed in similar hotels in London, New York or Tokyo. FSHK is a bargain compared to these cities and a whole lot better!!We started off our stay with a 3 hour treatment in the Aqua Spa Suite which is just spectacular. Where in the world do you find a 500-600sq ft spa suite with floor to ceiling windows looking out to the HK harbour with a steam room, shower, huge vitality bath, day bed, change room and toilet that charges less than US$70 per hour for using it outside of your treatment? When we got hungry we just ordered lunch from the Pool Terrace menu and it was delivered to our room. The treatment was amazing but had some small problems, which when raised to one of the Spa Managers, was solved quickly and with the best customer service possible. The Spa has got to be the best in HK with amazing treatment rooms. The prices are also very very reasonable - US$120 for a 1 hour massage - where do you find that in other big city 5 star hotel spas?!?! We paid around US$250 at FSNY and St Regis Dana Point. After our treatment we checked into the hotel and was upgraded from a deluxe harbourview to a huge harbourview suite. Everywhere we stayed in the US and Europe we never ever got any upgrades. The next morning we had breakfast in the Pool Terrace (excellent breakfast) and a swim in the heated pool. The hotel also kindly let us delay our check out to 2pm. The hotel may be relatively new so there are some areas that they do need to improve. For example there is a DVD player in the room but the only available DVDs are for children. Would be nice to build up a DVD library for adults but it wasn't a big deal.The hotel is located on top of IFC Mall which has many excellent restaurants and shops. The location is good too because you are well away from busy HK streets, yet conveniently located in Central. In most hotels in HK, as soon as you are out the front door you literally step onto a busy main street but here they have a little courtyard driveway out front. WIth all hotels, the service really depends on its staff and you can't beat the staff in this hotel. They are all genuinely friendly, hard working and efficient. Everyone always there to help and greeting you by name and not expecting a tip. It's really service from the heart, which is what's great about Hong Kong. I definitely recommend this hotel and think it's the best hotel in Hong Kong right now for both business and leisure.

<Content>a great, great hotel As a self proclaimed, highly critical hotel lover, this place was great. I chose the peak view king with an oriental motif on a high floor, and it was spacious, beautifully furnished with spectacular architectural details and abolutely amazing lighting, especially in the bathroom.The service was great--Asian hospitality at its best. We've stayed at many of the great hotels in the world, including 25 different 4 Seaons and this hotel along with the George V stands above them all. A great, great hotel

<Content>Did not disappoint A superb hotel that only needs a few more lifts (elevators, if you prefer), a few more smiles from its staff (but this is Hong Kong), and a few inspired pastry chefs (perhaps they could be poached from the Hyatt?) to make it heavenly.

<Content>Liked it much, but overrated.. Stayed 5 nights at this faboulus hotel! Service is in the very top and ambience is nice. Hwever, compared to other hotels in Asia their pricing is exorbitant (500 USD per night for an ordinary room) and is simply not worth it. Hong Kong is becoming expensive, so if you enjoy comfort, good service and easy access from the airport by train, use the Four Seasons. I have tried other hotels in Hong Kong more worthwhile my self..

<Content>Superb in every way Given the praise that this hotel has been received both in these pages and those of CNTraveller and Travel and Leisure, our expectations we could have let us in for at least a minor disappointment. Instead we had one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had anywhere.I think it really bears repeating that the Gate Greeting at the airport is worth every cent of its $800HK price. After some 20 hours of travel from New York, nothing could have been more welcoming than the sign with our names on it at the end of the jetway. You are then whisked along by motorized 'golf cart' leaving all your fellow passengers to muddle their way along a very lengthy passage to Passport Control. (Upon leaving JAL actually estimated that 20 minutes is needed to get from the gate to passport control). Instead, you are whisked past everyone else, have your temperature checked, your passport looked over and off you go to baggage claim. From there a second greeter takes you to the hotel's beautiful grey Mercedes. In less than one hour from our plane's arrival, we were at the hotel's front door.My partner has visited Hong Kong on several occasions --staying at the Peninsula, the Regent, the Mandarin--but nevertheless even he was impressed when we were greeted by name at the car door by the Four Seasons manager and taken to our room for check-in.We took a Harbor View King Bed room, requested and were assigned a high floor room with a stunning view of Victoria Harbor. The room itself was perfect. No detail is overlookedand the style and comfort of the place made me wish we had more time to spend in the room. From the 42 inch flat screen to the closet space to the comfortable seating, we lacked for nothing. The bathroom was flawless as well. We particularly appreciated having housekeeping set up on our timetable so that at no time was there one of those jarring knocks on the door.Turn down service is also on your schedule. It's these details that set the 4 Seasons apart. The concierge service was superb in getting us reservations wherever we needed them. We liked the breakfast buffet in the Blue Bar which we used daily. The pool and the spa are not to be missed and completely in keeping with the style and elegance of the whole place. We only wish the weather had cooperated so that we could have enjoyed the outdoor pools more. The hotel is ideally situated in Central. As previously mentioned, my partner's last visit to Hong Kong was some 14 years ago and he was astonished at how Central has overtaken Kowloon as the heart of Hong Kong. In fact, the Peninsula seemed rather lonely and forelorn when we visited her and we were delighted we'd been steered by our friends in HK to the 4 Seasons. All in all, I can't say enough good things about this hotel. No wonder it gets the raves it does. I look forward to a return visit.

<Content>Perfection -- stayed 20 nights this year This year alone, have stayed here about 20 nights covering about 9 check-ins (I travel from HK to China several times each trip). Even stayed there on my birthday, and they left a lovely chocolate birthday cake in my room, and every hotel person who came to the door (maid, turndown service, etc.) wished me a happy birthday. Rooms are spectacular w/ view, amenities top-notch via L'Occitane lotion/gel/shampoo, and men's shaving kit features regular travel size Gilette shaving cream with Gilette razors. Spa is beyond decadent, and pool visually disappears into the bay. Only complaints are over-attentiveness and a slightly sparse business center.

<Content>A beautiful hotel, with first rate service and facilities Our experience at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong was excellent all round. The hotel has a great location in the new International Finance Centre (IFC), so its easy to access Central and the ferry piers. The building itself is fabulous to look at, and is decorated in a stylish minimalist way, whilst remaining comfortable and pleasant.Although I guess its primarily designed for business people, we found it to be an ideal base for our family (two young childen). In particular, the infinity swimming pools are superb, and provide a good place for RR after a day of sight-seeing or shopping.The restaurants in the hotel are of top quality, but a bit formal for families. However, there is obviously no shortage of restaurants in the surrounding area or in the IFC mall below.On the other hand, breakfast, in the 45th floor buisness centre, was very good, and felt quite relaxed.Our room was beautiful (the kids didn't want to leave it!). We had two double beds and a lovely bathroom, and a panormaic view of the harbour. Broadband, LCD TVs, in-room facilities all on tap.The Four Seasons in Hong Kong is undoubtedly one of the best hotels we have stayed in - very highly recommended.

<Content>Great Expectations Being a luxury hotel junkie, I had to stay at the Four Seasons Hong Kong to try it out when I was there for a wedding. As Tripadvisor reviews were largely superlative in their praise for the hotel, I had great expectations.1. RoomsI loved the fact that the room was large by Hong Kong standards and the bathroom was fantastic! The flat screen TV in the bathroom and the rainshower were fabulous. The hotel had also provided his and her bath amenities. ( However, this did not quite compare with the Banyan Tree which gave personalised bathroom kits in a fabulous bag and it would be great if the Four Seasons could follow suit.)Unlike the Landmark Hong Kong, the windows were in the bedroom and not in the bathroom - no worries with privacy there! You could also draw open the curtains to read by light of day rather than slouching around without natural light.The noise insulation in the room was good. (I could not hear any traffic or corridor noise during my stay.)One nice touch was the complimentary tea and coffee facitilies offered by the Four Seasons. This is in contrast to other Four Seasons hotels I've stayed at in other parts of the world where you have had to pay for a pot of hot coffee.I would recommend paying slightly more for a harbour view room as the peak view rooms look onto the office buildings which made for a somewhat depressing urban view.2. ServiceThe check in and check out service was impressive. However, it was disappointing that I had to call three times to ask for my morning newspapers to be delivered before dashing off to work at 8am. Room service breakfast was also average. I had better breakfast downstairs in the Blu Bar which had wonderful pastries and fruit.The shuttle bus service to Airport Express is very convenient, but it is a shame that there was only one bus which meant that a guest had to wait for the bus to make its rounds. The bus queue was also not well managed (at the hotel end) by the doorman as a couple of guests queue-barged in front of me.The gym and the pool facilities were wonderful and the staff were very helpful! The gym overlooked the harbour with a view of Kowloon.3. There will always be a brideIt seems that Four Seasons Hong Kong is the chi-chi place to see and be seen for wedding dinners and lunches. Local society congregates here for celebrations, I spotted Stanley Lai and Richard Li while I was there; who knows who you might see?

<Content>Would definitely stay here again Stayed here recently and was pleasantly surprised - good location (the train for the airport is literally a few minutes' walk away), great facilities, nice room, friendly staff, good eating options. The pool/spa is a real winner. Can't really add too much that hasn't already been posted by others, but if/when I come back to Hong Kong I would definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>Hong Kong Four Seasons I have stayed at Four Seasons Hong Kong about 3-4 times, the last being for 5 nights in January 2006. Enough has been said about the plasma TV and dvd player. For a hotel in that vicinity (near Central offices and Aiport Express Station), the room is considered large. Mostly wood and large marble slabs, there is a certain luxury feel if you are into this sort of thing. Nice L'occitane toiletries and plush white towels. Shower heads can be alternated between rain and normal. If you get a room facing harbour, you can see the harbour lights in the evening. Gym is new and well-equipped, complete with bottles of mineral water and apples - however, you need to get staff to unlock the shower one floor up in order to be able to use it. For security reasons you need key card to access the lift when going to the rooms and this can be troublesome when you are holding lots of shopping. During one time that I was there, the key card failed more than once but the receptionist was professional enough to accompany me to the room to the 3rd time round. Business centre is small and because of direct aircon air stream, cold. Also, one down side is there is no point accumulation system or affiliation to frequent flyer program in spite of the high rates.

<Content>Posh and gorgeous Staying at the Four Seasons HK was a huge luxury. The hotel's location (in the International Financial Centre) is in the middle of the bustling Central district and at the doorstep of the beloved Star Ferry to Kowloon. My room with a view was impeccable and wonderfully comfortable. Loved the L'Occitane toiletries, the flat-screen TV in the bathroom, and the rain shower.

<Content>The Four Seasons an excellent hotel! What to say about the 4Seasons Hotel?In the hotel, the only trouble was to find the room card, to insert once inside the lift, to go to the room floor.Excellent service at the reception desk and good recommendations on what to do and what to see in HK.Good size rooms, with plasma, dvd..Absolutely super bathroom.We book 2 roooms (1 with view on the port and 1 with view on city). THe room with view on the city was biiger and still offeredgreat view over HK city, and was 20% cheaper.A -must to be see- in the hotel, is the swimming pool and the spa, both located in the 6 th floor.Swimming pool is just too great !!!. Spa was very convenient as well,to have shower before leaving HK at 8pm.Hotel is very convenient. Located just next to IFC mall, and 2 minutes walk from the Airport Express connection to get you to airport (time for connection: 25 minutes and price 13$).Hotel provide very convenient and free shuttle to AirportExpress terminal, so to take the connection to the airport.What to see in HK:-Get the cable car to top of mountain and get a great view over HK city (best views at sunset)-DISNEY park (directly with subway). Disney park is 1 year oldand has all. 3-D Disney movie and LION KING show were the best.-Go to STANLEY village (directly with bus 260), Stanley is a touristic village, outside HK, but the scenery on the way to the village is just too great.. Allow 2-3 hours for excursion.Restaurants tips in HK:-Go to top floor restaurant FELIX at PENINSULA HOTEL.Restaurant is not cheap, but great service and food (fusion). Super views over HK city.Take ferry to go back to Foiur Seasons hotel.-Chinese restaurantDirectly in the IFC mall (top fllor) , 2 minutes walk from hotel,go to the excellent chinese restaurant LEI GARDEN. LEI GARDEN is not cheap but provides excellent food, and excellent service. Reservations recommended 2295 0238-Japanese restaurant:KANAZAWA restaurant, tel 2895 0818, 48 Percival st, 2nd floorSmall but elegant restaurant.Excellent food and great serviceShopping tips in HK:Too many shops to write about. Definitively go to Central,and go jewlery and watches shops.Bought a ring to my friend, which was just too great.

<Content>Faultless Having previously stayed at the Island Shangri-la, it was with some trepidation that I booked the Four Seasons as it came on a recommendation and I remained unconvinced that it could better the Shangri-la.Pleasantly surprised, the service was perfect - attentive without being intrusive. On one hot day, upon arriving back at the hotel, the bell-boy even offered to get some cool water to quench my thirst; but I opted for the blue bar instead.There was always a staff member around to help and nothing appeared to be too much trouble to them. The concierge was very well informed and exceedingly helpful.The blue bar offers a payable light lunch buffet and also offers complimentary light snacks for afternoon tea.Having been fortunate enough to be upgraded to a deluxe harbour view room, I was blown away. Super bathroom, plenty of space in the bed room, lending itself to extended stays. 42 plasma and a king-sized bed also my room had the office desk setup which was great for reading the Sunday papers looking over the harbour.I've yet to stay in a non-suite hotel room that has more storage space, drawers and cupboards than the room I received. This was great as it allowed for everything to be put away and left a neat, clear room.No in-room check-in for me unlike the Shang, but the desk check-in staff did fill in all my details for me and since I received an upgrade, no complaints here.Breakfast, whilst good was not of the quality that the Shangri-la provides and the set-menu was of a limited choice.I'd stay at the 4S if I wanted great service, great room, fantastic pool location and a good selection of bars, but the lack of dining options and a buffet breakfast makes me want to stay at the Island Shangri-la next time.Overall, 4S is a better hotel but the decor and ambience of the Island Shangri-la makes for a more impressive experience.

<Content>Hmmm,... a bit of a let down My girlfriend and I were looking forward to another trip to Hong Kong. We normally stay quite happliy on the Kowloon side at the I-C. But, I had heard from friends and read on this site about how spectacular the new 4 Seasons in HK. Normally, we stick with hotels that we have enjoyed, but on this occassion we decided to mix things up a bit and booked a One Bedroom suite with a Harbor View..We arrived on separate flights and were both amused at being met at the airport gate by a red jacketed gentleman from the hotel, who promptly took each of us through imigration control and found our luggage.. We were whisked away to the hotel in a very nice Merc limo. I thought to myself that this adventure was off to a good start despite the miserable HK weather.Upon arriving at the hotel, the driver informed me that the hotel was fully booked and we would be staying in the Residential Tower.When we checked in I asked the Receptionist what had happened and was met with polite indifference and was told that we had been upgraged to a 2 bedroom apartment at the original price. That sounded ok to me, and we were escorted to our room on the 27th floor. When we walked into the room we walked into a small living area dominated by a kitchen table..on the Island side. The rooms were divided by a central living area, a bedroom and bath on either side, one bedroom had a desk and lamp the other appointed more like an apartment bedroom. While it was nice, it really wasnt what I was looking for. I asked the receptionist if there was a 1 bedroom on the harbor, I was met with a polite smile and I think this room is very nice and better than the one bedroom suite....hmmmmm. I gave up on the idea of flipping rooms and decided to have a go at it.We tried the hotel restaurant which was nice, but with there are so many other places to eat in HK, we skipped it for the remaining portion of our trip. The Gym and Pool are on the 60th floor of the Residential builidng well equipped with a fabulous view, but I found myself looking across the harbor and seeing the I-C and wishing we were there..We explored Time Square, Wan Chai and Hollywood road which were all very accessible from the hotel The new Lane Crawford is fabulous and the mall has a movie theatre and grocery store, where we put the small kitchenette to good use.While I can't fault the hotel to much for trying to make our stay enjoyable, I ended up feeling like I was staying in a rental apartment (nice one at that) but not the 5 star luxury hotel. that I had read and heard so much about.  In fact we cut our stay a day short to head off to Tokyo.

<Content>Just about perfect!!! Just returned from four season. Booked at the hotel based on previous reviews. I went to hong kong with my 3 kids so I booked a executive suite with a interconnecting delux room-expensive, but view from the 42nd floor made up for the extra cost. I used the hotel airport transfer, this is also worth the extra cost. However, I would recommend using airport express on the return journey to the airport. The hotel arranges free transfer to airport express and it is very easy to check in your bags and to obtain your boarding pass.The executive suite has a separate lounge and 2 plasma televisions-plenty of room for my family. The spa and pool are amazing. The service was 5 star, and attention to detail was amazing. The hotel had special bath robes and slippers for my kids.Faults-minor but worth a mention: No kids club. No separate lift to spa and pool. Only one restaurant served buffet breakfast (blue bar) and seating here was not adequate for kids. No clothes line over bath tub to hang my wet swimming trunks.Ok, so its not perfect, but this hotel is as close to perfection as you going to get, anywhere in the world!!!

<Content>Simply perfect I have stayed here 3 times in the last 6 months - and on each occasion it has been perfection. Airport pick up - perfect; Check in - warm and efficient; Rooms stunning (being upgraded to a suite on the last 2 occasions helped); Beds incredibly comfortable; the pool and spa areas (and related services) incredibly relaxing; The Executive Lounge great - when stopping over on the way to/from Europe, the snacks are enough for dinner.I guess the thing which really sets this apart from other hotel experiences is the focus every staff member places on you as a guest; your name is remembered by everyone, your are acknowledged and greeted in a warm an meaningful way by all staff and most importantly staff explain what they are doing, why they are doing it and how long it will take. They set your expectations and don't treat you like mushrooms (keep you in the dark and feed you rubbish).A really consistently fabulous experience and strongly recommended.

<Content>Simply the finest city hotel in Asia From start to finish a slick spectacular stay with a fine staff and stunning architectural design. I have had the pleasure of staying at many FS properties and at least 6 top hotels in HKG. This is incomparable.Only glitch was the dirty window and the rain outside. Don't miss it if you like the HK side.

<Content>The New Quality Standard in Hong Kong Hotels My wife and I recently stayed at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong. What quality! As always at any Four Seasons, service is fantastic. I have stayed in most of the other quality hotels in Hong Kong -- The Manderin, Conrad, Penisula --- and find the Four Seasons to be the best of a great lot. The view from the Infinity Pool alone is worth a stay.

<Content>Blows every hotel experience out of the water I spent 4 nights there only a month ago and I still like to pull up the photos that I took there just to remind me what high living was like. I can't even begin to tell you what the spa (massive) and outdoor pool are like. The pool is relatively quiet and not at all crowded throughout the day. Also, the best time to spend some pool time is at night when all the bright lights of the city are towering up above you. Everyone there is extremely polite and very accomodating. My boyfriend even made some very late night/early morning requests and they were very quick to respond. Amazing!The bathrooms are very luxurious that for someone like me who only spends 10 min max to get ready, I was caught several times for spending nearly an hour there.The location is great and close to major shopping areas.

<Content>First Impression only OK Read the rest of the reviews and they say the same Four Seasons in a teriffic hotel. I normally stay at The Mandarin Oriental (currently being refurbished) so booked a harbour room. First impression was a big dissapointment. Reception is not special - If I am paying 拢300+ a night in HK I expect an escort to the room, not to just get a key card and pointer towards the lifts.It makes a very good hotel a bit ordinary. Still if you're not that fussy the 41st floor view was stunning and the room OK - comfortable but a bit small - with a superb bathroom.Staff otherwise exceptional and the pool overlooking the harbour is probably reason to stay there on it's own. Everything is as expensive as you might expect from a new and popular 5 star hotel. Stayed for 5 nights then travelled for 2 nights now back at the hotel for 3 more nights, though this time in a 2 bed suite. This is magnificent so if you book try haggling for an upgrade, it's worth it.

<Content>One of the best city hotels We took the airport express to the Central station and as we werewondering how to get to the hotel (it was way to close to get a taxi as the hotel was literally right next to the station but it was not easy to get up there with suitcases and bags), we saw a 4seasons staff standing there waiting for us. He took us to the hotel in their shuttle bus. Check in was easy and all the staffs were incredibly friendly. I love the small touches in 4seasons. Flat screen tv were everywhere,even in the bathroom , with all the channels known to mankind. Bedlinens were good quality and the room was very decent size for a cityhotel. We stayed in the peak view room, hence not the best view in the hotel but since there were no tall buildings right in front, you wouldn't feel being spied on like some of the other hotels in Central.Shopping is also very convenient. The IFC mall is just downstairs and it is much less crowded than many other shopping malls in the area. There are also many new restaurants in the IFC.

<Content>FS: The New It HK Hotel I stayed at the new Four Seasons in Hong Kong from 17 to 20 February 2006. It is, without a doubt, the It hotel in the SAR; I found that, in overall appeal and service, it just edges out my two other HK favorites, the Peninsula and Ritz-Carlton. The FS really does have it all: (1) Location - perfect, attached to the IFC Mall and adjacent to the HK Airport Express Station. It's a short walk or taxi ride to anywhere, including the Star Ferry, in Central. Yet it's also somehow set apart. The property comprises two towers: the hotel proper and residences. (2) Rooms: I stayed in a Harbour Deluxe room, at a promotional rate that included HK$500 toward in-room or hotel-restaurant dining. While it was mostly foggy or rainy during my 3-day stay, the view of the busy harbour and Kowloon was inspiring. The decor is smart, sleek, and new-millenium luxurious: lots of dark woods, marble, and glass. The main TV is a huge plasma unit, with a smaller LCD screen over the bathtub. The bathroom is very luxurious, with a large soaking tub and walk-in rain shower. (3) Spa: the best I've seen to date in a hotel. (4) Pool: ditto, with two outdoor infinity pools and jacuzzis overlooking the harbour. (5) Food: room service is the usual FS excellent, and Caprice Restaurant has to be one of the best French restaurants in Asia. The staff -- particularly the maitre d' and his assistant -- pampered me, discreetly yet thoroughly introducing each of the eight mini-dishes comprising the degustation menu, which was out of this world. They advised me that they'd come from the FS George V Hotel in Paris with the goal of establishing the best French restaurant in Asia. Mission accomplished, I'd say. While the meal, with champagne and wine, cost almost half of the nightly room rate, it was more than worth it. (6) Staff/service: impeccable -- not only do the mostly young staff do everything right and go out of their way to help and advise, they are beautiful, as if they'd just come from HK fashion runways. I've really nothing bad to say about the FS HK. It's a new standard in the SAR, and I can only hope they'll run promotions similar to the one I enjoyed again in the near future. Even at regular rates, the rooms are a decent value. Well done, FS.

<Content>Fabulous! My first time in Hong Kong was made all the better by staying in the Four Seasons. If you can, organise for the hotel pick up from HK airport (KHD 800 each way). We were met at the plane, whisked on a buggy to customs, then straight down to luggage and into air-conditioned limo. On arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by name at our car and taken directly to our room where we were checked in in comfort - and this was all within 1 hour of landing!My boyfriend loved the 42 plasma screen opposite the bed and it came in use when the jet-lag kicked in! The bed itself was also huge and incredibly comfortable.We had a city view which, at night, was fabulous with all the lights and we didn't feel cheated by not having a harbour view.The Spa/Pool was amazing. There is an outdoor infinity pool which overlooks the harbour and the hot tub (on what was a really chilly morning) was most welcome.I have stayed in many Four Seasons hotels and this is definitely one of the best. Overall the service was excellent and unobtrusive. Definitely a great city hotel which I would thoroughly recommend to tourists/business travellers.

<Content>Loved brand new hotels! Spent two wonderful nights (09-11 Feb) at the new Four Seasons Hotel. Booked it since we loved staying at brand new hotels and it was having a promotion with free HK$500 dinning vouchers at its restaurants. Having stayed at various hotels in Kowloon side - The Peninsula, Intercontinental (both with superb views of the Victoria Harbour), Marco Polo, and Hong Kong Island side - Harbour View Renaissance, I would vote this new Hotel to be among the very best in Hong Kong at this present moment (early 2006). This was our first stay at a Four Seasons Hotel. We had found its huge lobby somewhat under-furnished, as some 4 or 5 stars hotels we had been to had nicer looking lobby than theirs. We found lobbies to be very important to a hotel's reputation as well as status as they always say, 'First impresssion counts'! The other minor fault is the mini TV above the bath, the height of the TV somewhat makes lying down in the tub difficult to watch .......they should have adjusted the TV lower. Another not mentioned point about the location of this hotel is - the MTR (subway) of this hotel (the Hong Kong station) actually DOES NOT connect with the rest of the MTR lines/stations of Hong Kong! Although this is of no fault of the Hotel, you would have to walk a good 10-15 minutes from the Central Station (where the train last stops) to the Hotel. Though the long walk was in air-conditioned comfort and sometimes even with the ease of travellators, I had to say that it is rather tiring especially after a whole day of shopping and walking. Room wise, we had a Deluxe Harbour View room which had the MOST COMFORTABLE hotel bed we ever slept on! The 42 inch Plasma TV, nice harbour views of Kowloon side (although a far cry compared to views from the Peninsula or the Intercontinental) , floor to wall yellow marbled bathroom, huge bathroom etc, were all very nice indeed. But it somewhat reminded us of the Grand Hyatt....Even the location, within the massive IFC Mall, is similar to the Grand Hyatt in Beijing, China, which was connected to the Far East Shopping Plaza. Great for shopping, I would say, moreover, with a good supermarket called the 'City Super' in the IFC Mall.The Hotel's service staff, like the posters here had said, are all very very well trained. They are courteous, obliging, and not at all snotty (with the exception of 1 or 2 snotty ones at the expensive and classy Lung Keng Heen Chinese restaurant on level 4). On checkout, they made a mistake of charging us one minibar item which we swear did not consume, and the reception lady graciously cancelled it - no questions asked! They even went the extra mile for their guests, by providing turn down service, free large-sized Perssimons (a very nice fruit) and free shuttle to and fro the Airport Express train service at the IFC Mall. Though the distance covered is short, you might find lugging all your luggages up and down escalators within the massive IFC Mall, both trying and tiring! Simply ask and they would provide this wonderful service. All in all, stay here if you do not mind splurging or see if they have a promotion going on. Without promotion, our room would have cost us a whopping HK$4,100 plus tax plus service (about US$600 a night). Or else, stay here if you have business to do in the Central District of the Hong Kong Island, or are travelling to and fro to Macau, the outlying islands, Disneyland (direct MTR train service), great shopping at the IFC Mall, convenience to and fro the Hong Kong Airport. Although a great stay with many nice conveniences, we would only rate this new Four Seasons as a top end of a good 5 stars Hotel, certainly not a 6 stars.

<Content>Quite simply the best! I try and stay in Four Seasons all over the world where ever I can. This new addition to the group does them proud, a truely stunning contemperary design coupled with traditional Four Seasons unobtrusive service.From the moment we were met on the airbridge at the plane to the moment we left, the whole experience was first class.Yes the Peninsulsa offers more of what Hong Kong used to be, but I believe the Four Seasons represents Hong Kong now and the future.A great location on central, with easy walking to shops, Soho, Mid Levels etc.Should be number one in ranking.

<Content>Excellent Service and Great Location This was an excellent hotel with tip top service. Tons of staff to cater to your every need. Anyone who tells you to stay outside of Central, either has budget limitations, or isn't sane. Staying in Central is convienent and feels alot safer. Great stay and I highly reccomend the Four Seasons Hong Kong. It was a great place to bring in the new year.

<Content>You have to stay there! I went to HK on business and stayed at Four Seasons. I have stayed at several in the chain and find each and everyone of them to be guaranteed luxury and service.The staff upon arrival are friendly, but not annoying or in your face. The check-in agent showed me to my room, hit the key points and left without being intrusive.The room was large with amazing features. The doors were solid, cupboards and wardrobes everywhere and 42 plasma screen! The bathroom was amzing, large and TV screen above the bath.Location is in the IFC mall, which was handy as my office is in IFC 2 and all the shops you could possibly want were there. Nearby was the rain to the airport. It also wasn't a long walk on the walkways into the cityI visited the pool and spa before getting my midnight flight. The pool was amazing, infinity edge and overlooking the city lights, particularly at Christmas time was wonderful. Inside the hot tub was brilliant and the attendant was very attentive.I had room service a couple of nights and the food was above average.Overall, fantastic hotel, especially for business.
