<Content>Perfect Weekend Getaway We live North of Boston and decided to book a 2 night stay at Jury's to enjoy the city and nightlife. The hotel is in a perfect location and within walking distance to tons of shopping and great restaurants. Our Deluxe King was a beautiful corner room with a huge bathroom and tons of natural light. Valet parking, reception and housekeeping were all top notch. The bar in the hotel is a lively spot for both hotel guests and outside customers (!). I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Boston. The only small complaint is that the workout facility is very small and does not meet the standards of other hotel properties in this category.

<Content>Lovely Hotel We have just returned from a four night stay at Jurys Hotel.Very little to complain about most of the Staff were very friendly and helpful and went out of thier way to accomodate all guests.The concierage was excellent the door men everybody we encountered except the receptionist on check in we had two rooms booked as we were travelling with our elderly mother i had emailed the hotel and requested that the two rooms be allocated on the same floor.However she informed me this was only a request and we could not be accomated on any floor in the hotel for which i find hard to believe no two rooms on any floor at 15.30pm in the afternoon. Anyway after this inital hicough we enjoyed our stay at Jurys.Location was good close to all shops and Prudential centre a walk from Fauneil Hall but it is an enjoyable walk.The doorman arragnged a Taxi back to the airport for us which cost us $50 which was good value for five people and all our luggage.On our last night we asked for a nice restaurant to be recomended and they recomended Grill 23 across from the Hotel while our meal was nice this food was overpriced for a party of four with one glass of wine no dessert tea/coffee we paid $275 other just as nice restaurants even the hotel was nicer than this.The rooms were good and spacious we booked two rooms for 5 people so three shared one which was still ok.The beds were very comfortable, room service was good and efficent we ate in the restaurant on our first night just when we arrived this was a lovely meal and reasonably priced service excellent

<Content>Great Hotel... Loved it!!! Myself and my mom stayed at Jurys in Boston for 5 nights. It is worth spending a bit more as the rooms are lovely and the staff are very helpful. The concierge was extremely helpful with organising trips and booking restaurants. I will definitely go back to Boston, as its a fab city and Jurys will always be my first choice for accommodation.

<Content>Simply the Best Recently spend a week at Jury's when we belatedly celebrated by husband's 60th with a trip to Boston to see Tina Turner in concert at TD Banknorth Stadium.As other reviewers have said, the hotel is first rate. All the staff are very friendly. We were upgraded on arrival to a superior room. The room itself was large, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was great with a huge walk in shower. We had asked for a quiet room and we were given one at the end of a corridor.We ate at Cuffs bar one evening - where we found the food was reasonably priced. That bar can get very noisy on some evenings but there is another quieter bar on the floor above which is open some evenings. We ate breakfast in the restaurant most mornings. The service was good but the buffet did not have as good a choice as other hotels I've stayed in. There is a business centre where guests can access emails etc.You are conveniently placed for both the shopping (Prudential Center and Newbury Street within easy walking distance) and the T, with Arlington station close by. There are many restaurants nearby. I'd particularly recommend Grill 23 opposite for a great evening meal.

<Content>Boston Shopping We have just come back from a 5 day trip in Boston.The hotel was recommended and highly rated by the Agent and first opinion and impression was very good-the staff meet and greet was superb.However it must have been the Nosiest and busiest Bar in Boston and you would have no chance getting a seat in the evenings plus the fact the noise was a Joke--never heard so many people chatting and shouting in one place.We did get a drink up stairs and there lies another problem-the Price 4 drinks=28 Dollars about 拢20 for 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine..and then there was a coffee and chocolate $9 in hotel in paper cups and up the road same order $3.50.We ate once in the bar but we sent it back the Burgers and toasted sandwiches they served were soggy and the side salad was soaked-the evening manager did not charge us for it--big deal....a free drink would have been a good will gesture.Also do not hire a car for a day through the Hotel--we hired one thru a agent they recommended cost $196 for a day.......rip offThe rooms were big--but could do with coffee facilities in them.The staff were very Helpful.Finally the trip ended with a power failure which the team handled well.Overall the trip was OK but could have done it all in 3 days.As for the Hotel it was ok but can not understand all the rave reviews.

<Content>Beautiful hotel but ... This is a beautiful hotel but when something goes wrong I would question the ability of management to deal with problems dispite the absolute courtesy displayed. We recently stayed for 5 nights having booked directly with the hotel as we were asured they could provide the connecting rooms desired as we were travelling as a family. On arrival we could not be given the connecting rooms as they had been 'given away the previous night as the hotel was fully booked'. We agreed to the offer of upgraded non-connecting rooms, with the option of moving to the connecting rooms the next day, but on checking the rooms only one was an upgrade and the other reeked of smoke. Moving to another two rooms caused a delay of another half hour (having already spent a considerable lenght of time at the reception desk) as one had to be cleaned in a hurry. How well this was cleaned became evident the next morning. When using the shower a previously used bar of soap with hair embedded was found! Requesting the rooms to be throughly cleaned we opted to stay put as it was just too inconvenient to move - enough time on the first evening of our holiday had been wasted. All our complaints were dealt with in the most courteous manner but we were still left with a bad taste in the mouth. It is a beautiful hotel but ....

<Content>excellent we stayed in 2 rooms on the 8th floor in jurys. excellent service throughout. staff very friednly and very helpful. Rooms were spacious and beds were comfortable. The hotel location is excellent, within 10-15 minutes walking distance from downtown crossing for shopping, short walk to newbury street and prudential centre. All major attractions are close.Would definitely recommend this hotel, free use of gym and internet. We didnt have breakfast included and ate in the hotel once which we thought was overpriced for what it was but that is the only negative that i could find

<Content>Fabulous!!!! We have just returned from a fabulous 4 nights at the Jurys. It is ideally placed for visiting all of the sites. The staff were brilliant, the rooms were so clean and the bed was so comfy. No complaints whatsoever. We would definitely stay here again. The first morning we had the American  Irish breakfast in the Stanhope Grill and it was lovely. We also ate in the Cuffs Bar, we recommend the Angus Blackened Beefburger and the Fish  Chips. The cocktails were very good. The bar can get very busy and has a great atmsophere.It''s not the cheapest or the dearest place but you just have to shop around.We also recommend Legal Seafoods, Joe's American Diner and for a less expensive breakfast try the food court in the Prudential Centre.

<Content>Loved this hotel We stayed at the Jury's Boston in October this year. We were a party of 4 adults and all absolutely loved this hotel. From the minute we arrived the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We checked in around 6pm evening time and there was a great feel to the hotel. We went to our room to change and found the room to be beautifully decorated and very clean.Firstly we went down to the hotel bar which is called Cuffs. There was a mix of hotel guests and city workers enjoying a drink after work. There was a warm and friendly atmosphere which instantly made you feel comfortable and relaxed. There was also a patio area leading from the bar which was lovely.We ate in the restaurant for breakfast each morning and although this was not included in the room rate found it to be excellent value for money. There was a choice of buffet breakfast which included eggs, hash brown, bacon, sausage, cereals, danish and fruit juice or you could eat A la Carte breakfast which also looked lovely.We also ate in Cuffs bar during our stay and again the food was excellent.I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who was looking for a hotel in Boston. We all hope to visit beautiful Boston again one day and would definately stay in this hotel again.

<Content>nice hotel but don't eat there! I agree with another review that the hotel is noisy from the locals in the bar. We never got a seat in the bar as it was full of locals. The room on the internet says it caters for four. There were four of us and the room was quite comfortable but was only ever catered for two, with towels for two, choc for two etc. On the first night we ate in the restaurant. There was 8 of us together and they didn't seem to be able to cope with the group. We waited over an hour for our food. Some asked for well done steaks, which came out medium. When we spoke to the manager Nuala she said what did we expect as the steaks were thick. What kind of a way to deal with people complaining. On the next night after a hard days shopping we decided to try the bar and to go in in two groups to try and speed things up. The food was the worst food I'd ever come acroos. the chips were more than burnt. All 8 of us sent our food back. I asked for mayo and got a little jar that was already used. In fairness to the hotel we spoke with the food manager Shane, who was embarrassed when he seen the food. He offered us drinks and more food to make up. We wouldn't accept so he gave all 8 of us free breakfast the next morning to prove that the hotel could serve good food.Next morning the breakfast was good, with a good variety of foods. Its a nice hotel and the staff at the front deck and porters are very helpful with bags and where to go. They were very imformative.

<Content>Jurys is a credit to the brand My mum and I stayed in Jurys the 1st week of september, and the next time we go to Boston we will stay there again. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are superb and the staff couldnt be nicer. I really wouldnt take any notice of the reviewer from philly because it soulnd like sour grapes. Everything was rated below average, because of an incident which they admitted happened!!!Anyways moving on, we fould the staff exceptional. Do order room service, we were hit by hte rains of the hurricane on the sat and ordered the steak and the pizza. In the room in 30mins and so beautifully presented. $40 total incl room service charge, tax etc.Do go to the oulet centre. This can be booked with boston common coaches, or through the concierge. $35, you are collected and dropped off at your hotel. My advice is to walk to the very top and work your way back, make sure and check out Ruby tuesdays for lunch there, The salad bar is amazing.Try legal seafoods if you like fish!I compliment the jurys brand and remeber sour grapes taste bitter, so if you travelling from Ireland, look up prices on Expedia.ie We got a weeks stay in a deluxe room for 1000 eur.Stay there, you will not be disappointed.SlanNiamh O'Brien

<Content>BRILLIANT!!!! We spent 4 nights here and had a brilliant experience- we being myself,husband and 17 year old son. From the moment we entered we felt we were important. The staff were very friendly and had time to chat when we asked anything. The room was welcoming and we all loved the huge walk in shower. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows big and fluffy. The whole hotel was very clean. It is in a perfect position for exploring the city-which we all really enjoyed. We would recommend this hotel and hopefully will be coming back in the future.

<Content>Worst Hotel Stay Ever I stayed at Jurys Boston Hotel in September. While Boston was lovely, Jurys was terrible at best, especially considering the room rate. The last straw was that I was charged $500 three days after I checked out for room damage. While I acknowledge that the carpet may have sustained some minor stains, $500 is ridiculous. And there was no notice or anything. On top of that the assistant front office manager was so smug when confronted. I will never stay there (or any Jurys) again and I鈥檓 advising everyone I know to avoid Jurys as well. Boston is so lovely, especially in the Fall, don鈥檛 ruin it, stay somewhere (anywhere) else.

<Content>Will go again!! My partner and I stayed at Jury's for 3 nights and would definately recommend it to others. It was in a good location, really easy to walk everywhere, 2 minutes to Newbury street (nice shopping and restaurants. Also Grill 23 is opposite the hotel (not cheap in dollars but compared to home not bad for such good food and service) definately worth a visit if your having a romantic evening and want to stay close to the hotel. Overall i would say believe the pictures on the website. We had a standard king size bed and it was lovely. Nice size room with a super comfy bed, really nice quality pillows and linens. Bathroom was big, as was the shower stall so we did not miss having a bath. Also powerful hairdryer provided so won't bother packing one. This hotel isn't cheap but i felt it was worth the money. I watched this hotel for a while on Hotels.com before i booked and got emails when deals came up. In the end we saved about 15% by doing this. I think this hotel is perfect for young couples who will enjoy the novelty of sparkly lifts and a staircase that changes colour. We also arrived at the hotel 3 hours before check in and were taken straight to our rooms. Next time i go to Boston i'll go back to Jury's.

<Content>Average hotel, at best. We arrived Thursday evening for a three night stay after a trip to Las Vegas and were greeted by more noise in the lobby than anything Las Vegas had to offer ! The bar on the ground floor resembles an after match booze up and appeared to be patronised solely by non-resident young Bostonians. Friday and Saturday evenings were exactly the same and therefore there is nowhere in the hotel for residents to sit and have a quiet relaxing drink.We had an executive corner best view room on floor eight which was tiny even by US standards. The view on all sides was straight into occupied office buildings and the bathroom ( shower room ! ) had a clear view window which meant the blind had to be down whilst the bathroom was in use. The bathroom was large but poorly designed without a bath although more than adequate space existed.We breakfasted once at the hotel and the food and service was adequate but nothing special. Although the printed bill for breakfast said service was not included an additional rubber stamp in red highlighting this fact was stamped on top of the bill - how thoroughly naff !We paid $565 per night to stay here which seems absolute top dollar and the booking was made on the hotel's website.Whilst the location is good for walking around the shopping district, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the bed and bedding were extremely comfortable, my wife and I find very little else to recommend the hotel and quite a few things as highlighted above to put you off, and especially the bar noise which was quite absurd !The real mystery to me, having used Trip Advisor extensively in the past, is how this hotel can possibly be the current number one recommended hotel in Boston on Trip Advisor.....Philip Hills

<Content>Lovely hotel We had a lovely holiday at Jurys. We stayed for 3 nights in a lovely double room. We ate in the hotel dining room twice. We had 2 lovely steaks - highly recommended. We also had breakfast on our last morning - again also very nice. The staff are really attentive and can't do enough for you. The rooms are lovely, big comfy beds, and lovely bathrooms. Our room was at the back of the hotel and was nice and quiet.

<Content>Nice stay though a bit pricey After reading the Tripadvisor reviews we decided to spluge and stay at the Jury's during a recent trip to Boston. The hotel is lovely, with nice amenities and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and/or friendly. For us the hotel was perfectly located and it was easy for us to navigate to/from. Our package included breakfast which was delicious and generous. The room was small and did not have a nice view but was well appointed and clean. Try the Jury's for a splurge or a special event... but prepare yourself for a pricey stay.

<Content>Good Hotel Spent 8 night's in Boston with my 19 year old daughter. I selected Jury's on the basis of other trip adviser reports and the fact that I got a good rate of 拢840 from Opodo back in January for 8 nights.The hotel was perfectly adequate but lacked the special something that other guests seemed to find. The restaurant was pricey, the bar (Cuff's) noisy. I missed the fact that there were no coffee making facilities in the room although I accept that American hotels just don't seem to do this. We made use of the fridge and hotel safe but toiletries were not replenished each day which was annoying. The free bottles of water and chocolates on our pillow were a nice touch but my quilt had a cigarette burn hole which should have been noticed when room was prepared and the bathroom light only worked when the main room light was on which made life difficult during the night.Concierge was helpful when approached and willing to keep our bags on the last day as our flight home was in the evening.

<Content>Loved the place! Jurys Hotel - Boston After a long and tiring journey to Boston we arrived at Jurys to be told that due to the weather they had to relocate us at another hotel. At the time we were disappointed however the hotel were helpful organising and paying the taxis to and from the Colonade hotel. The Colonade was a lovely hotel and when we went back to the Jurys the following night they had upgraded us and provided us with fruit and chocolates and a letter from the manager to offer their apologies and to offer us an upgrade if we stayed at Jurys again. Jurys is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The bar has a fantastic outdoor area which would be great place to spend time in the summer. One point i would flag up is the hotel room telephone. I rang family in England and a 15 min conversation cost me $60 so beware!! Would highly recommend Jurys - and the Colonade if you have the money!

<Content>Would definitely recommend The staff were incredibly helpful and we found our overall experience at Jurys better than expected. The hotel bar, Cuffs, was buzzing - I've never seen a hotel bar so popular! Great cocktails and the food in the restaurant next door was great too. We had a corner bedroom and it was well equiped if a bit on the small side. The hotel was in a great location for seeing the sights of Boston and we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel in a great location! We stayed at Jurys for a week in early September, and loved it. The location was fantastic, just a few minutes walk to lovely Newbury street, Copley Mall and Boston Commons.The hotel itself was very beautiful. We checked in late, but the staff at Cuffs bar downstairs were fantastic and ensured we got a good meal even though it was their kitchen closing time.Beds were very comfortable, and the room was very spacious. Great shower in the bathroom with plenty of hot water at good pressure. Only thing we found odd was that the room by default didn't have a kettle to make hot water for tea/coffee - nevertheless, the hotel said they would have lent us one but they had none to spare at the time we were there.I would definitely pick this hotel again if I ever went back to Boston.

<Content>Not as good as expected My husband and I recently spent three nights at Jury's. The hotel was nice enough but nowhere near the standard we were expecting after reading all the reviews on Trip Advisor.Our room (on the third floor) was very cramped, with dated furniture and the carpet had obviously not been cleaned properly for a very long time as it was covered in stains. The most surprising thing was that there was no coffee maker provided in the room. It was possible to get coffee downstairs but only at very odd times and certainly not during the main part of the day. The bathroom was a reasonable size with lovely thick towels and robes but we only had a walk-in shower and no bath. It would have been lovely to have been able to soak our aching feet at the end of each day!!!The bar in the lobby was really noisy and always so full that even if we had wanted to get a drink or a snack, it would have been impossible. Jury's was definately not our idea of a boutique Hotel.

<Content>top hotel We stayed in Jurys for a week- 3rd floor corner room- alot of room, great spacious bathroom- desk but no sofa, just 2 chairs, one recliningWasnt really noisy at night- the bar is buzzing at the weekend.Helpful pleasent staff, valet guys chatty. Easy in room check out, turndown service, complimentary water and coffee machine in your room. Wi Fi sometimes struggles to cope with the numbers logged on but its freeI would only point out that it sometimes takes 15 - 20 mins for the guys to get your car- ring down from your room in advance and they will get the car ready for you. And it costs $39 per night to park- plus you feel obliged to tip. THere is a public garage down the roadBut it was top rated on Trip adviser- certainly seemed deserved to me

<Content>Met expectations After selecting this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews, I researched best available rates online. I then called the hotel directly and they quoted a much higher rate, which I questioned based on my research. After I provided the specific websites and rates I was referencing, the hotel graciously honored the lower rate. We arrived on Friday and checked out Sunday. The property is a typical boutique hotel in the business district and is in an excellent location for visitors to Boston. The entrance is a bit awkward. There is a small foyer at the street with a flight of stairs up to the lobby, reception desk and elevators. A flight of stairs down from the same entrance foyer, there is an impressively active, quite noisy bar open to both the entrance and the lobby. Due to this, I requested a quiet location. We were given a corner king-bedded room on the third floor with a back street view. We did not hear any noise from the hotel's bar and it was otherwise quiet except for some late night noise from the street below us (a crowd of men yelling and cheering -maybe a bar on the back street?) and early morning noise from garbage and delivery trucks). I would recommend a higher floor. Our room was attractive, clean and welcoming. It was not overwhelmingly spacious, but did allow for a desk on one side of the room, an armchair and lamp table on the other, and a wall unit with a television compartment, shelving and drawers opposite the foot of the bed. An in-room safe, ironing board/iron and umbrellas were provided. The bed was very comfortable and made up with high quality pressed linens. The bathroom was clean and modern with a walk-in shower (no tub, but this may vary room to room), L'Occitane toiletries, fluffy towels and bathrobes, and a full-sized hairdryer (rather than the travel size usually encountered in hotels). The housekeeping was very good and provided nightly turndown service. There was one odd thing about the hotel d茅cor, which was otherwise attractive and tasteful - the lining on the back wall of the elevators is a gaudy, iridescent material that looks more in keeping with a cheap nightclub.

<Content>Love Jurys Hotel! #1 in Boston! I can't say enough about how great this hotel is! We have stayed here twice when we have visited Boston and I wish I could afford to stay here every time! Gorgeous rooms, elegant hotel and gracious staff! I was very impressed with their crib bedding for my infant....nice and cozy with bumper included! They provided a teddy bear, blanket and bath set! If you stay in Boston, this is a wonderful place! Walking distance to Boston Common and Newbury Street, short T ride to Fenway! Will definitely return!

<Content>Great Hotel, great staff. What can I add to the other reviews ?Great hotel, great service, brilliant staff, excellent rooms, great bar, great food.............does it all.Other hotel owners should go and have a look at Jury's because they have got it just right. From your first moment in the hotel until the moment you check out the staff make you feel special. Great introduction to Boston. If I had to put my finger on one aspect that was better than all the rest then I would have to nominate the Stanhope. Great food, fantastic service, best waiter (Greg I think!). If there was one little downer that would be the parking fees .but then again this is the middle of a big city and parking costs......Would go again and stay at Jury's anyday.

<Content>Noisy at Night My husband and I had a 2 nigh stay at Jurys which is a high standard hotel. However, the basement bar seems to be a meeting place for young locals. We had an aperatiffe there before going out for dinner and we were amazed that groups of young people were drinking from bottles and stubbing out their cigarettes on the beautiful stone floor. When we returned later for a nightcap in the lounge, we could'nt hear our ears with the rock music from the night club downstairs. Youngsters were streaming in showing their age confirmation passes. I expressed our dissatisfaction to the receptionists, who promptly replied ' its been voted the Best Bar in Boston'. Because of this, I personally would not recommend this hotel to friends over 35 years.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, fantastic staff I recently stayed at the hotel and found it to be a wonderful experience. It is obvious that a lot of care and attention was given to all details. The decor is modern and sophisticated. The staff is friendly, congenial and attentive. The rooms are elegant with an excellent bathroom. Glass shower separate from the tub. The room was immaculate. Two anecdotes that help describe the type of service the hotel offers:When I went to check out the Manager noticed that the front desk was busy. He asked me if I was being helped and then proceed to complete the transaction. After I left the hotel I noticed I had misplaced my Iphone's charger. I called the front desk to explain what happened. They told me they would check to see if they could find it and call me back . After an hour had passed they called to let me know they had found it and that they would keep it in a safe for me. That is service.This is very well run hotel.

<Content>GREAT STAY!! WOW! My husband and I came here about 5 months after our honeymoon. You couldn't really call us newlyweds but not really old dear couple either. We called this our first real trip together. We didn't really consider our honeymoon one because we only flew in hour. Anyways, we booked this hotel 2 days before we left. Money was not an option so we looked for the best. And we found it! I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was but it definetely surprised me. I have done a lot of traveling before I was married but I had never stumbled upon a hotel like this one. The service was great. Everyone was friendly and kind. Anything we needed was brought fast. The cleanliness factor was top of the notch. Everything was clean and orderly but very well decorated. Our room was beautiful and the view was magnificent. I want to come back here one day on our 5th anniversary so this will definetely be the hotel I book.

<Content>Absolutely Superb I visited Boston with my cousin and stayed at the Jurys Hotel from the 29th August 2008 through to the 3rd September 2008.We were celebrating my cousin's 50th birthday and everybody there made it very special for her.The service at the hotel was excellent and the staff were really helpful and friendly. One example being the concierge researching how we could get to Martha's Vineyard, providing us with bus timetables and Ferry schedules, including prices. This was not one of the normal 'over the counter' excursions but still they did everything they could to help (and we had a great day on the Vineyard as a result).The bar at the hotel - Cuffs - was fabulous. The prices were good and the measures even better!! We didn't try the food in the restaurant, but the bar food was delicious. It is obviously a popular place as there were locals in the bar every night, although it was never too crowded. We were made to feel welcome by the locals too, which was an added extra.The rooms were large and clean. Having stayed in a number of 5 star hotels - I can say the bathroom is the largest one I have seen - and the towels were changed twice daily!The location of the hotel in Boston is excellent, with everything being in walking distance if you are fairly mobile. We had considered going to the Liberty Hotel, but having seen both, we definitely chose the right one.Special thanks to Chris in the bar and to the lady outside the restaurant. We never actually got her name, but her and Chris made us feel more like friends than guests.

<Content>Book it Dano! just returned from Boston, Stayed at Jurys and the Langham, and would recommend Jury's every time. No gripes about anything at Jurys, the room was good, Excellent breakfasts with very attentive staff. Free internet access, (Langham charged $10). Jurys give you a couple of bottles of water in the mini bar everyday free!! (Langham charged $8 for a bottle of water from the mini bar) also like the more relaxed feel about Jury's,

<Content>Loved Jurys Boston This a lovely, elegant boutique hotel with impeccable service. We were treated like royalty by the excellent staff. For example, 4 staffers recognized us by name and followed up the next day after we made an inquiry at the Conceriege. Wonderfully appointed rooms in this historic building that recently has been completely renovated.

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and myself stayed 3 nights at Jurys at the end of July. The stay was a memorable experience. From the moment when we checked in after a very long flight, we were met a a smiling face who gave us hot face cloths to freshen up. The room was great, good decor, not clinical, and the best bed we have ever slept in. The staff throughout the hotel were friendly and very helpful (special note of thanks to the doormen who were a mine of information). The location was within easy walking distance for everywhere you would want to go. Boston as a city supprised us, and we still talk about how friendly, clean and safe it felt. We highly recommend Boston and Jurys to stay in while you are there.

<Content>Welcome to the Airshaft Got a great rate by booking through one of the onlines. After arrival it didnt seem like such a great deal. The room had NO light. I'm not THAT picky about views but the airshaft-facing window made the room dim at noon on a bright August day. Even with lights on it was tough reading a magazine. There was no tub, something we hadn't been made aware of... just a standup shower. Hallways were often full of cleaning supplies just lying around. At one point a cot had been abandoned, wedged in the corridor. This entailed pretty much crawling over it to get to the elevator.Staff was pleasant but didn't seem particularly connected. On arrival the doorman just stared at us until I said hi and asked what the process for valet parking was... no hello, nothing. In our days there with a lot of entries and exits, 3 or 4 doorguys were always hanging around... not a single hello or acknowledgment from any of them. The concierge gave us vague directions to a major museum wrapping with the helpful advice to just ask someone where it was when we got off the train. Room service was crazy expensive (and I'm used to NYC boutique hotel prices) and REALLY bad.Public spaces were nicely designed and pretty on the good side. The building is an old police department building. Again pretty but not pretty enough to justify the price and lackadaisical service

The staff were lovely, the ambience in the hotel was relaxed and friendly, and there was a lovely bar downstairs that had great food. I cannot fault this hotel and it would be the top of my list for future stays in Boston.

<Content>Great Hotel Spent a week staying at this hotel with husband and 2 teenagers, 19  17, had a great stay. The rooms we had were a good size,beds were very comfortable and the showers great, also had the best hairdryer I have ever had in a hotel. Found all the staff friendly, polite and helpful, the door staff were helpful in recommending places to eat. Hotel was in a good area, not to far from shopping malls, Newbury street and Boston Common. Food was good had dinner there on first night and breakfast each day, my sons could not believe the size and amount of pancakes served for breakfast, I enjoyed the fruit available and the unusual juice combinations that were sometimes served. We all enjoyed staying here and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A Quality Hotel Jury's provides a very comfortable stay with everything you need to make you feel at home.  I generally like to stay in boutique hotels so I straight away noticed that there was nothing distinctive about the hotel's design or furnishings. However, the bed is comfortable, the TV is large and the shower was great.  In fact, this hotel had a very nice, and large, bathroom for the price. The room itself was a little small.  We ordered room service once and it was a very tasty angus burger delivered after midnight and in generous portions. Bonuses: Free internet and printer. 2 terminals downstairs that you can use at your leisure. Free water bottles, 2 per day. The mini-bar fridge is empty. What a fantastic innovation! We loved this and could fill it with our own soft drinks and extra water and even put some snacks in there the night of our departure to eat the next day. Very convenient! The only complaint I can make is that the room is a little drab in terms of decorating and the TV didn't have much of a selection of channels. The only cable channels were sports  news, no entertainment channels. Also from what I read I expected the neighborhood to be more energetic. It was really a business district and completely died after dark. All in all I would definitely recommend the Jurys Boston and also recommend the tiny Italian takeaway place on the corner down the road called Viga (304 Stuart St). Yum! It's only open 11-3 on weekdays for lunch - lines out the door!

<Content>Excellenty located high end hotel Spent 3 nights here in a king room. Very tastefully designed and furnished hotel throughout with some beautiful sculptures in the public areas and nice design touches, thus avoiding a bland corporate look. Much higher quality hotel than the Jury's brand manages to achieve in Great Britain.Noticeable change in guests between weekday and weekend as the business areas kicked into life on Monday with all of the meeting rooms being in use and the bar later being taken over for a private evening reception. Not a problem in space terms as there is a large lounge next to reception but just made it difficult to get a post dinner drink on our last night.Very professional and attentive staff across all levels. We only visited the basement restaurant twice for breakfast as this had an unnecessarily elaborate menu and was expensive. The hotel is in an excellent location for the Back Bay area of Boston with Newbury Street and Boston Common plus plenty of restaurants all within easy walking distance. Once you have your bearings Boston is an easy city to walk around.We would recommend Legal Seafoods on Park Plaza for lobster / seafood, Smith  Wollensky on Columbus Avenue for steak and Stix on Stanhope Street just for interesting food!We thought driving in Boston was fine, although the signage can be very last minute for turns into the recently built Interstate highway tunnels so you need to be alert.

The best thing is the location, near the shops and Boston Common. Concierge slightly pushy, but always helpful - parking though is expensive, in my view at $39 per night. Generally though a good stay and happy with the place

<Content>a hotel in the heart of it all The Jury's Hotel was exactly as advertised. Great location, beautifully appointed rooms...l'Occitane products were a nice touch...fluffy robes and turndown service. We didn't have a view, just a brick office building, but that would be my only beef. The bar was hopping downstairs...and there was a good vibe in the lobby. Walking distance to Boylston and Newbury. It was a nice place to come back to after a long day of touring around.

<Content>good hotel The best thing about Jury's was it's location. It is near to 2 different T stations, near to Newbury street with all it's restaurants and walking distance to the Public Gardens and the start of the Freedom Trail. Staff were all friendly and did what they should. We had a street view which was nice.  I found the bed uncomfortable which was disappointing. Biggestgripe was that one lift was broken for 4 of the 6 days we were there - so the delays in the morning were really unacceptable. I agree with a previous reviewer, I am not sure why it is top in popularity , but it is a good hotel. We could have done with a pool.

<Content>Our favorite Hotel in Boston Jurys is our favorite hotel in Boston. We stay their at least once a year. We are always amazed that one or more of the hotel's staff remembers our name. They may be a 3 star property, but their service is easily 4 star as are their wonderful accommodations. We love the Stanhope Grille (also 4 star) and Cuffs an Irish Bar is the most happening place in Boston's young executive level after hours.

<Content>Lived up to reviews Jurys location is fabulous. You can walk almost everywhere and easily hop the T or a bus. The room was average and when we arrived we found a pair of sun glasses left under the desk and a dirty washcloth under the drapes. It did make us wonder how well the room was cleaned but everyday the room was made up very well. Neat to have an empty refridg and the bottle of water.No good places for breakfast nearby. The hotel restaurant is expensive but good. Try Smith and Wolensky just around the corner in an old castle with great steaks, etc.The desk people were efficient but cool however any call made was quickly responded to and every effort seemed to made by the staff to respond to requests. We had a broken desk chair that was exchanged within 15 minutes after a call.Overall a good experience in Boston.

<Content>Unpretentious comfort and luxury Chosen for a night stay in Boston, I was impressed with the service, the style of the hotel and the comfort of the rooms. The little touches such as complimentary water, decent sized towels and quality toiletries make it a great place to stay. The quirky history and stunning renovation make it a unique place to stay. The location was good, a 5 minute walk from Newbury and Boylston St attractions. I have high expectations for hotels- as a former flight attendant I have stayed in so many I lost count but this was a great choice for a Boston.

<Content>Jury's is Great This is our family's first trip to Boston and first time staying at a Jury's and it's a fabulous hotel. The employees are all friendly and helpful, the rooms are relatively small but luxurious and the hotel offers lots of nice amenties, like free wireless internet, fitness center, bath robes, towel warmer, complimentary water, etc. Jury's is located within two blocks of the Arlington T station which makes it easy to get around town without a car. It's 3 blocks from Newbury Street, which has an abundance of great restaurants and shops. It's also easy to get to Fenway Park on the T if you're going to a Red Sox game or to walk to Boston Common and the Freedom Trail if you're interested. Our family really enjoyed staying here and would definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone visiting Boston.

<Content>Good location but lacking charm The hotel is a convenient distance from the rail station and not far from the centre of town - so a good location for business travellers who don't want to deal with car hire but need access to the areas around Boston. It was a good stay. Quite expensive but that may have been because I booked last minute. One reservation I had was with the charm of the hotel. The hotel bar is used mostly by those not staying at the hotel - which is not too surprising because the hotel did not seem to be very accommodating for its guests to eat and drink, except in their own hotel room. I would consider staying here again but more as a bed for the night than as a place to enjoy Boston in the evening.

<Content>Great Stay With Pilgrimage to Fenway Park At the end of a baseball trip up the East Coast, this was my final hotel in my final city. This place was spectacular! The only -- ONLY -- significant drawback for a single person traveling with friends is that there is no traditional entrance. Normally those things are tacky, but when catching a cab, they're quite benficial. Otherwise, for a 2 twin-bed room (bed sizes were btwn twins and fulls), layout was great, location great, comfort superb. I would easily stay here again!

<Content>Fabulous Experience! We tried Jury's from recommendations here on Trip Advisor and once again we weren't disappointed by everyone's suggestions! We fell in love with this hotel, the service was beyond what we've experienced with other stays (even 5 star). Everyone on staff, front desk, bell hops, valet drivers and general manager were extremely welcoming. They even helped us dismantle our travel box from the top of our vehicle in traffic (and then kept the box for us in storage in the hotel) --was really a special sight my husband doesn't want to re-live! Note to other box top travelers---travel boxes on top of SUV's or Mini-vans don't clear parking garages in Boston, none of them, notta.....Hotel was clean and inviting, fabulous eclectic style. Awesome location, no vehicle needed. Close to freedom trail and lots of restaurants within easy walking distance. Bathroom, very nice, heated towel warmers, robe, etc... Toiletries lovely! The bars in the hotel were packed. The hotel is in what seems to be the financial district We were there on a Fri. and Sat. night---professional crowd.Highly recommend! I searched out the best deal on Travelocity and then called the hotel directly, they honored the same rate. Hope you enjoy Jury's and Boston as much as we did!

<Content>This hotel is fab I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this website, and it did not disappoint. The location, rooms and staff were fantastic. The rooms were clean and spacious. The hotel restaurant served excellent food, we ate there twice. I have recommended this hotel to 2 people after staying there and they have now booked to stay there also. I can鈥檛 wait to return. I also recommend seeing The Blue Man group whilst you are in Boston. Watch the videos on You Tube. The theatre is only a 10 minute walk away.

<Content>Disappointing We visit Boston every summer and stay at a different hotel each time in order to sample as many as possible and to find a favorite. Based on countless positive reviews we selected Jurys this visit. Although the location was very good and the room satisfactory I was quite disappointed with the stark and generic ambiance. The lobby is cramped, unimpressive and awkwardly located a flight up from the street. This made a poor first impression of which we were reminded each time we arrived at or departed from the hotel. Although my husband waited at the curb for me to check in, no doorman or valet greeted him to ask if he could be of service. The front desk staff was cordial but distant. Nothing about the check-in experience, or the hotel for that matter, felt welcoming. With all the hotel choices available to Boston visitors I'd think twice before selecting Jurys.

<Content>Judge and Jury's no longer out!!! Stayed in this hotel in early June but have been a bit negligent in writing a review. I, as always, paid close attention to Tripadvisor reviews. Not let down in any way- a great hotel. Very modern, clean, well kitted out rooms - which I feel were spacious. The hotel is located well and only a couple of blocks from the Common and Newberry Street.What really made the hotel (as with all hotels) is the staff. They were helpful, professional and treated you as a friend - particular praise to Joanne in reception and Emily in the bar! The bar is a really jumping place which may be the only negative in the eyes of some travellers looking for a quiet place to relax in the evening. Suited me just fine - going back next week.

<Content>Staff make this an excellent hotel We found the staff to be great. We arrived by car in a frazzle due to Boston traffic and street patterns, We were greeted calmly by staff who immediately learned our names and were very helpful. This process carried on through our stay. We would highly recommend the hotel.

<Content>Great business hotel Stayed with my wife for 5 nights during a business trip to Boston. The hotel location is great, close to the T and at the heart of Back Bay.The hotel atmosphere is great and the stuff makes you feel that you return home after a long day. You come to the room and the bed is ready for you, there are 2 bottles of water (free) and a small chocolate.If you need to work you can do it easily from the hotel, free internet access (wireless at the lobby and wired at room), business center with printer, copying machine and facsimile - all free.Two things I didn't like:1) The hotel room is quite small with small desk and 1 sofa.2) Ordered Pizza from room service and was shocked to see it was tiny (it is our usual dish for late night room dining and in every hotel we were it was quite big pizza, here it was very small.Bottom line: great hotel to stay with special atmosphere.

<Content>Jury's Everything We Wanted and More My husband, 19 yr. old son and I just returned from a five night stay at Jury's. We ended up on the 2nd floor, facing Berkeley. First, very roomy, especially the bathroom. The beds were very comfortable, amenities, towel warmer rack, toiletries, large umbrella, turn down service, call within minutes to check to see if everything was fine with the room, etc. made this stay perfect. The bar (just below our room) is very active every evening and there is the sound of people having one great time usually until around midnight, but it really wasn't a bother. Perfectly located. We ate breakfast one morning in the restaurant and it was very good. Highly recommend this property.

<Content>Jury's is all about the service! We were able to check in early afternoon and were given a room on the side of the Pub courtyard. Check in was managed thoroughly and quickly. Upon arrival to the room, the front desk called up to make sure all was OK. The room was nicely decorated, with 2 bathrobes, l'occitane bath products, 2 complimentary chilled water bottles, Conde Nast travel mag, free wireless as well as free use of the business centre and printer (handy for on-line check-in). Heated towel rack was a nice touch although not needed in the summer. Blow dryer was located in the closet (outside the bathroom). Beds were very comfortable. Turndown service included 2 chocolates left as a treat. Only downside: carpet in our room was a little 'worse for wear' with some noticeable stains and the pub is popular so we could hear them into the early morning. Staff were very accommodating in allowing us a late check out (mid afternoon) as our departing flight left late. Hotel is in great location, within walking distance to shopping, public transportation etc. We even walked home after the RedSox game! Hotel itself is nicely decorated although small lobby - understandable given that it is a converted former police station. The staff at Jury's were very friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming. Would definitely stay again, mainly for the service!

<Content>exactly what we were looking for Arriving in Boston around 11PM after a 28 hour flight from Australia, my partner and I were looking for somewhere quiet and comfortable to recover from our journey. Jury's was perfect. Check-in was blindingly fast (and they even gave us refreshing hot towels at reception). The room was just large enough, and really comfortable. A perfectly acceptable room service meal was delivered to our room within minutes of ordering and we had a great night's sleep. And walking distance to the Public Garden next morning - couldn't have asked for more.

<Content>Great City Hotel - Location, Energy, Extra Touches I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel over the weekend. This is one of the few times when I had nothing to do with the selection of the hotel (my boyfriend did the leg work) and I was pleased with nearly everything! The hotel room was in impeccable shape and we loved the free bottles of Poland Spring we received each time the room was cleaned, the chocolates at night, and the dual headed shower. The towels were bath-sized and fluffy, the bed was super comfortable and filled with soft pillows and blankets, and the hairdryer came with extra attachments (not necessary, just a nice touch). My only complaint was that the bathroom had a frosted door, which isn't wonderful for privacy. There is a very active bar downstairs (locals love it for happy hour) but you wouldn't know it upstairs. The location puts you in walking distance to Back Bay (where hotel is located), Newbury, the parks, etc. Highly recommend for a fun city stay!

<Content>Best hotel ever!!! Just back from a fantastic 7 night stay at Jurys Boston.One of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in where we were treated like royalty from the moment of arrival Got a fantasic deal with Expedia as we got 30% off because we stayed more than 5 nights.Our room was a double superior on the 6th floor.Gorgeous bathrobes,L'Occitane products and turndown service each night.We had breakfast in their restaurant each morning where a buffet was available for $18.I had an omelette each morning as well as fresh fruit and cereal which could be ordered from the server.Delicious!!I was really impressed with the complimentary use of the internet in their business centre,We stayed for 3 nights in a Hotel in Cambridge before checking into Jurys where it cost $5 for each 15 minutes use.The staff at the front desk were always so friendly and helpful especially Joanne who was so kind to our little boy.She sent him up milk and treats one evening.Such a lovely gesture.I can highly recommend Jurys for a fantastic stay.Enjoy the pampering!!We'll be back!

<Content>Like this hotel but. We first stayed at this hotel two years ago, when we have a very comfortable room with a large bathroom, so we were really looking forward to our return visit. However, the first room we were given was tiny with an overpowering smell of mould, so we asked for another room. This didn't smell but was even smaller than the first room with a tiny bathroom, which should have been checked before being allocated to us because the bed hadn't finished being made up and there was only one bathrobe in the bathroom. These things were rectified after we mentioned it but as we had paid 拢135. a night we felt let down and disappointed especially as it was such a small room. Also it would be nice to have some way of making a hot drink in the room Even so we would return to this hotel again because of the friendly and helpful staff, the central position in Boston and the relaxed atmosphere there. We especially liked the Il Barrista coffee shop which was excellent value.

<Content>Great Place to Stay From checking in to checking out I cannot fault Jury's Boston. All of the staff were professional, very friendly and basically couldn't do enough to help. Our room on the 8th floor, was clean, quiet and very comfortable. We were never without clean fresh towels and the toiletries provided were absolutley gorgeous. At turndown more fresh towels and a chocolate for each guest. The hotel is only a short walk from Boston Common, Theatreland and from an indoor shopping mall and out door shops. If you like a great steak I would recommend going to Grill 23 just across the road from Jurys where I had the best steak ever.

<Content>Not Quite There Yet (5 Star) We had a corner premier room (320) for a three night weekend stay in Boston. Got a substantial discount from Orbitz, at least over what was posted on the hotel website. Jury's was a good value for the discounted rate, but I would have expected better for the rack rate. The corner room was nice, but did not have a flat screen TV or ergonomic chair as advertised on Orbitz. Service was always provided with a friendly smile, but there were some kinks here and there. Follow through by the staff was not always there for requests. Despite the reservation having been made for two, the room didn't seem fully prepared for two...for example, there was only one bathrobe, one bar of soap, and insufficient towels (at least for us). Turn down service in the evening provided fresh ice and chocolates. My partner didn't care for the frosted glass on the bathroom door, as light from my late night forays kept her awake. We liked the barista in the lobby for morning coffee and muffins... very good. Unfortunately, they were closed Monday morning, so I had to deal with Dunkin' Donuts' lines. Free local (Boston Globe) and NY papers were available each morning in the lobby...a nice touch.As with most fancy hotels, there was no coffee maker in the room, and no vending machines in the halls. This hotel is in a great location...just blocks from the Arlington and Back Bay T stations, as well as the Theatre District and the Public Gardens.Jury's is trying hard to be a five star hotel, but isn't there yet.P.S. Don't miss a delicious dinner at Giacomo's on Columbus Ave. This site (unlike the one in the North End) does take reservations, but both are cash only. Best halibut I've ever had.

<Content>Lovely well located Hotel We stayed at the Jury's for just one night at the end of a two week fly drive around New England, but we are so glad we did, this is a brilliant hotel, with the perfect blend of modern decor and old fashioned hospitality. From the moment we checked in we were impressed with the clean, modern look of the hotel and the friendiness of the staff. The room was also great, quite large with two queen size beds and a fab bathroom with almost a wet room for a shower. Having spent three nights at the Omni Parker at the start of our stay, there is no comparison Jury's wins hands down(Omni was fine, just a bit weary and dated with very small rooms)We were also impressed that food/drinks in any of the hotel's bars/restaurants were not of the extortionate price you expect of hotels generally, rather they were on par with any of the bars we visited during our stay. This is also a great hotel location wise, with many bars/restaurants being located only a few minutes walk away and about a 25 minute walk from Faneuil Hall and the more historic part of the city.All in all a great base from which to explore a lovely city.

<Content>Not good for 3 ina room The hotel itself was very clean and friendly staff helped to make our stay enjoyable. I had booked a room for 3 people not near the evlevator; we arrived to find our room next to the elevator and only 2 beds. This was rectified by allocating another room for us but it was not big enough to have the cot bed out until the other 2 people had finished in the bathroom each night. This was very inconvenient. The restaurant did not cater for vegetarians during our stay there either.

<Content>Deserves the #1 spot Stayed here for two nights through a last minute change of plans and we got a great rate with hotwire.The check-in staff were very professional and friendly and we got a great (even if a little small) room which was nicely furnished and with a very comfy bed.The hotel gym was well equipped and bar downstairs has a good scene without disturbing the hotel too which is a bonus. We only ate breakfast in the restaurant which was also good but they stop the buffet service too early for people who are on a relaxing holiday which gives the impression they are gearing more to guests on business.Furthermore the location is great which meant that we could walk everywhere and in the evening it is just a short cab ride to some fantastic restaurants.The only warning is the complete rip off that valet parking is. For circa $40 a day they will park your car or for $10 a day you can park it yourself in the public and safe car park located right in front of the hotel!All in all we would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.

<Content>truly a winner i stayed here for 3 nights from april 10th to 13th 2008. i had initially booked a twin room for 2 adults on hotelsclick,com and the rate was 513euro for the three nights. a week before we were due to arrive, a friend decided to travel with us. i contacted the hotel directly to enquire about the possibility of a rollaway bed for the 3rd person. i was told that i had received a complimentary upgrade and that the room could accomodate 4 adults. when we arived, after a swift check in, we were shown to our beautiful room 922. beautifully decorated, spacious with lovely l'occitane products in the bathroom. in the resturant at dinner that night, we received complimentary appetisers from the chef. my cola was refilled free of charge. breakfast was a treat each morning. the staff service was impeccable and was more 5star standard than the hotels 4 star rating. i can not say enough nice things about this hotel

<Content>Right up there with the Best of 'em! I have stayed at the Jury's before, and have loved it every time. I had recently stayed in a four star hotel that was so severely lacking, I could not help but compare the Jury's! Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The rooms are lovely, the beds comfortable. For a 3-star hotel (I believe) this hotel has thought of everything and outshines many 4-star hotels. Instead of having to purchase bottles of water for $4, they put complimentary bottles in your fridge, which they restock! There are full-sized ionic tourmaline hair dryers with narrow attachments AND diffusers! They carry L'Occitane, which is always lovely, in the bath. Returning from a long day to Irish music playing and chocolates on my bed makes turndown so wonderful. The Cuffs bar is so lively, the restaurant delicious. Late checkout goes until 2pm!!! The hotel is also in a fabulous location close to all that Back Bay and the South End have to offer. All for a reasonable price. I promise, you will NOT be disappointed!!

<Content>Wonderful service We have just returned from a 2 centre stay W New York then Jurys Boston. Jurys Boston is by far the best hotel for service and value for money I have ever stayed in. ( I do at least 2 hotel hols a year for the last 5 years) The attention to detail is excellen.The staff are friendly and exremely helpful. The room service was out of this world on value for money speed of service and variety. I have never written a hotel review before , but I am so impressed with Jurys and I did not know they have other hotels in the UK so i am now off to check them out. Happy Holidays.

<Content>Big Mistake I booked this hotel because of all the great reviews on this site. BAD IDEA. We checked in in the late afternoon and learned they gave our confirmed room with two double beds away (with confirmed guarantee for late arrival which we weren't late for at all) and offered us what they said was an upgrade...a corner room with one king size bed for two adults and two children. After waiting for over one hour for their engineer to figure out how they will fit in two roll-aways (which was against the fire code) they decided to move out the desk, chairs etc to fit the beds in. The roll aways were just threads away from the springs popping out, needless to say the kids were up all night and so then were my husband and I.The manager on duty offered half off for the night, after I said we weren't paying for the night. Not exactly the gold standard in customer service...the room should have been offered at no charge right off the bat since they broke their confirmation with us, had us wait for over an hour to try and resolve and then delivered two horrific roll-aways. We checked out in the morning and moved to another hotel. When they learned we were checking out two nights early they offered us the junior suite. By that time we were so aggravated and had made other arrangements and were ready to go. We moved over to the Hyatt Regency...professional staff and very clean hotel.

<Content>Pricey but nearly flawless Pluses: good location, professional and friendly staff, well-appointed and well-sized rooms (why do people think they're small?), tasty food from room service, free water bottles in the minibar and no tempting junk food (unless you request it to be stocked).Minuses: overpriced valet parking (use a garage instead), overpriced a la carte menu (order the pre-set breakfasts via the door tag instead), not all rooms have bathtubs (but the shower was nice), crowded bar downstairs (no problems with noise, and the bar may be your scene, but it wasn't for me).I didn't have as good a view of the city at Jury's, but I thought our room was great and convenient. The room was smaller than the other Boston hotel I stayed at, but it was very comfortable and the corridors were nicer. Lots of staff at the desk and doors, though checking in or out can get congested at times. The elevators had this awful shiny wallpaper in them, but the stairs by the bar had a nice waterfall... I will be booking Jury's again for my next trip to Boston.

<Content>Great Hotel This is a really great Hotel. It is very centrally located.( No need for a car). The Staff are really great, very helpful and Friendly. The Hotel itself it Beautiful, clean and tastefully decorated. The bedroom we stayed in was very spacious with a great shower. The bar was really busy with a great atmosphere. We had the Bar food which was great quality, great value and huge portions. We ate in the Restaurant last year and that was also very good. I would highly recommend this Hotel and will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Comfortable bed The hotel is luxurious and very comfortable - the most comfortable hotel bed we have slept in for ages! The bar is lively and staff attentive. Don't fall for the valet parking though. We did ($39) and its over twice the price of the car park next door and we could have parked on the street overnight for free. The reception did refund the overcharge compared to the car park when we complained in fairness to them.

<Content>Perfect! Could not fault the Jurys though didn't utilise all its features. The double bedroom was small but perfectly formed. There was also a mini fridge in the room which was replenished daily with two bottles of still water yet enough room to house own refreshments. The bathroom only has a shower, not an issue for me, but I appreciate the need for some travellers to have a bath. Luxury toiletries (including ear buds and cotton wool) which were, again, replaced after use.I used the fitness room at 6am, 7am, 8am and 6pm and, although small (6 cardio machines, rack of free weights and modular weights) I didn't have a problem with having to Q for equipment. It also has three tv screens, magazines, a water machine and towels. As other reviews have mentioned; location's ideal, staff are pleasant and helpfull and internet access was a bonus. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would gladly stay here again if I ever return to Boston.

<Content>Great time at the Jurys Just got back from a 6 night stay in Boston at Jurys hotel in early April, staying in a deluxe double room with my husband and 9 year old daughter.The hotel is very good. Room was plenty big enough with free internet access which we found extremely useful - for booking restaurant tables, checking opening times for attractions and checking in to our return flight online. We had a laptop but there are computers available downstairs if needed.Location is very good. We walked to the waterfront (Aquarium  Childrens Museum) on the first day which is just a little bit too far, especially with a child, but we quickly found the T very easy to use and only just around the corner from the hotel. It also meant we explored Newbury Street  Trinity Church which we may not have done if further away from Back Bay.We had breakfast in the hotel on 3 mornings but other days just went to Au Bon Pain next door to Arlington T Station which was fine when we didn't need a big meal. If having breakfast in house, the buffet is best value - you can order waffles with the buffet  they were great!Staff at the hotel were all very friendly and there are various dining options all very close by as well as the bar or restaurant at the hotel itself.Heartily recommended!

<Content>No Coffeemaker While the location was very convenient, there was no coffeemaker in the room. We asked for one, and initially were told one would be brought up, but half an hour later, the story changed. They had all been taken out of the rooms and none was available. This turned out to be quite inconvenient for me, an early riser. My husband and I also enjoy a cup of tea in the afternoon, but that was not available either. We had to walk 4-5 city blocks on a blustery spring day to find a cup of tea at an Au BonPain. This is a standard amenity in other hotels. We won't stay there again because this simple convenince is not available.There was also a lot of thumping bass noise from the basement bar until quite late at night.

<Content>Amazing time at the Jurys Boston Hotel I stayed at the Jurys Boston Hotel for a week at the end of March with my boyfriend and had an absolutely incredible time. It was my boyfriends first time in Boston whereas I was returning after 11 years from having lived their previously. We had an incredible week and were very sad to leave. The Jurys Hotel was by far one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at, and I've stayed at a fair few. The hotel staff were very friendly and very accommodating through-out the whole trip. The room was lovely, some have said the rooms were quite small but I thought it was a great size. Everything about it was wonderful. We had breakfast in the hotel a couple of times, we didnt have the buffet as we didnt think we could possibly eat enough food to justify spending $18. But what we did have was great. It's in an absolute perfect location for everything, a two minute walk from the 'T' station, some great restaurants in the area, one especially great meal was at the Bonfire Steakhouse, a bit on the pricey side but so so worth it. We had a great night there. The complimentary internet in the Jurys business centre was very useful as it was the only means of communication with some friends I had in the area. We had drinks in the bar Cuffs a couple of times too, it had a great atmosphere and we weren't disturbed by it at night at all. I don't have a negative thing to say about our stay at the Jurys, and when we go back to Boston we will definately be staying with them again.

<Content>Comfy room; great service; reasonable price I stayed at Jury's Boston on a biz trip for a conference - three nights. Booked through Orbitz at average cost of $267 per night.Check-in was smooth and very pleasant, with hot towel at the reception desk. Lobby isn't incredibly fancy, but decent. Halls on room floors are very nice, brightly lit, etc. Room was spacious, with very comfortable bed and complimentary mineral waters (2 per day). Complimentary internet was both wired and wireless in the room (I prefer wired).Service was very pleasant on occasions when I sought help.I had breakfast via room service - nothing special, and I can't judge the restaurant based on it.I plan to go back for a pleasure stay some time.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Great Location I stayed at the Jurys with my 17 yo daughter for 4 nights in Feb/08 and loved the hotel. The room was extremely comfortable, if a little small, but the bathroom quite spacious. The beds, luxurious sheets and towels, heated towel rack, and L'Occitane toiletries made us feel pampered. The best thing about the Jurys for us was the location! Three blocks from Newbury Street, within easy walking distance to Copley Place, Back Bay, the Public Garden, and Downtown Crossing made the Jurys the ideal hotel for us. Public transportation could not have been easier: less than 2 blocks from Arlington Station on the Green Line, within 4 blocks of South Station on the Orange Line which is also the Back Bay stop for Amtrack. A Hertz rental car facility was only a couple blocks away near the Park Plaza Hotel. In short, a wonderful base from which to explore the Boston area. While the location is fairly quiet in the evening, the Jurys' hotel bar is quite popular and filled with revelry every night. We asked for a quiet room and never heard a peep from the crowds in the bar. It wasn't until our last day that I discovered the spacious and comfortable sitting area in the hotel lobby. It's separate from, and off to the left of, the check-in area.

<Content>Jury's Boston Hotel Stayed this week-end at Jury's and had a lovely time. They're very welcoming from the time we pulled up in our car to the time we left. While there really aren't many restaurants immediately around Jury's, there are a bunch of great looking restaurants within a 10-15 minute walk (especially on Tremont Street). The hotel rooms are small, but pretty, and well-designed. In the interest of being green the thermostat is kept at 69 degrees, which is fine, but that temperature is cold when you're getting out of the shower (no baths). They should have a heat lamp in that bathroom so you don't freeze! Other than that, the only negative I have is the $39 plus taxes charge for parking your car. Worked out to almost 25% of the room cost. However, we would recommend Jury's for a nice Boston hotel.

<Content>Jury's - Trip Advisors Were Spot On We stayed in Jury's for five nights recently and it was excellent. All the staff we met were very helpful and polite. The room was beautiful, very clean and the free bottles of water were a lovely touch. There is free Internet access in the business centre which was handy. The location is very central - there are plenty of good restaurants with in easy walking distance and the shops on Newbury and Boylston are close by. We caught the T at Airlington Station just two blocks away. I knew that Jury's was No. 1 for hotels in Boston on Trip Advisor but it was even better than I expected.

<Content>Jurys Boston is Fab Just stayed at Jurys Boston for five days over Paddys weekend. I work in the hotel business and can be very critical of other hotels but I must say I could not find fault with Jurys. The rooms were spotless, the staff were really friendly and helpful and the food...well not gourmet but american! I think I overloaded on fries. Just watch if you are having breakfast and do not want to eat much order off the a la carte menu as the buffet menu is great but costs $18.00 per person.

<Content>Best Hotel we have stayed in!!! Jury鈥檚 is an amazing hotel, Building is stunning, and D茅cor is very tasteful and well done. (My husband is in the building trade and was impressed with the high standard of finish and detail.), Great locationRoom was lovely, king bed was huge and lay out was great, plenty of hanging space in wardrobe. Room had a fridge with bottled water which was replaced every day, but you had the option of putting your own drinks in.Bathroom again was spacious, with walk in shower, bath sheet towels and great toiletries you really only need to take toothbrush and paste.Rooms were cleaned very day to a high standard and turn down service every evening.We only had breakfast at the hotel which was fantastic; we had the buffet which was great value for money.Cuff bar was excellent, staff very friendly as in the rest of the hotel, bar was great for lunch and evening drink, it seems to be popular with the locals as well as the guests.Would highly recommend this hotel.Boston it self was great, a lot calmer than New York City, which is where we normally go this time of year, be sure to pack warm cloths in March it was very cold but bright blue skies, rain one day in the 6 we were there.Nothing seems to open until 10am, so no need to rush around, Freedom trail was good, long walk if your not used to it, so wear comfterbale shoes.Quincy market is great, Cheers bar good for an afternoon beer and snack, the Aquarium is worth a visit, Shopping on Newbury Street were good and only a few mins from Hotel, as is the Copley and prudential centres. Found 2 good restaurants with in walking distance from hotel, Cotton Wood (Tex mex) and Legal (Sea food) very reasonable, starters/main plus beers and wine for two was less than $100 with tip.Recommend Boston, but 6 nights was more the enough to see what is to be seen.

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel This is an excellent hotel, well located in a fantastic city. On arrival, the staff are friendly and courteous. The room was reasonably sized and clean. The bed was very comfortable and there was a 32 inch TV. One nice touch was that 2 complimentary bottles of water were in the fridge and replaced every day.The maid service was excellent and the room was thoroughly cleaned each day with a turn down service each evening. as mentioned previously, Cuffs bar is nice and very popular locally. The hotel organise a bus to the outlet shops in Wrentham every day for $38 per person and it takes about an hour to get there. On the bus you will get a coupon book and if the aim of your visit is shopping this is very useful.The hotel is well located in Boston and Boston Common is within 5 minutes walk of the hotel. For shopping Newbury street is 10 minutes away. The closest T station is arlington and even more shopping can be found in Quincy Market (3 stops on the green line to Government Buildings)One restaurant worth mentioning is Stephanies on Newbury St. Really good fine dining and when we went on a Monday night it was full but luckily had made a reservation through the hotel.Overall, a great city was made better by a lovely central hotel with staff whoi were very pleasant and genuine

<Content>Best bar in town This hotel is very central for shopping, sightseeing etc and from the moment we arrived, we were very well looked after by staff.Cuff's bar has a great atmosphere, and seems to be the place to be after a hard day's work at the office!! I would say though that the food in the bar was disappointing.A great place to have breakfast is the YWCA just round the corner from the hotel - don't be put off by the paper plates and plastic cutlery. The food was excellent and the place was spotless. Breakfasts were superb!!!!

<Content>Excellent choice in Boston I did a tremendous amount of research before our 3 night trip to Boston to find just the right hotel: not too expensive (under $200/night), but nice enough to feel like we were in a special place. Jurys did noit dissappoint. The staff is friendly and attentive, the decor is upscale and modern in the lobby and the rooms, and the room was quiet and very well appointed (gorgeous bathroom with all stone tile/counter tops and nice robes, nice linens, furniture, etc). They give 2 bottles of water free everyday, wired AND wireless internet is free, and room service was good and extremely prompt (10 mins on average for breakfast to arrive everyday). The location is also ideal. I highly recommend this place! TIP: the room has a stereo with a CD player. The have a limited selection of CDs to lend at the front desk, so bring your own.

<Content>A different kind of hotel I stayed at the Jurys Hotel in Boston based on the reviews I saw on TripAdvisor. The staff was very attentive. The room was on the small side but nice. There was no bath but a decent sized shower stall with two shower heads. There was a safe in the room. The door automatically deadbolts. I had a little problem getting the card key to work. The turn down service came with two drinks. The temperature in the room was 72 degrees when I arrived and I had to switch the thermostat to a/c which meant I woke up cold. The Stuart street entrance was one level down from the lobby and I would not say that the hotel is very handicap accessible. There is a glass staircase with a waterfall up to the lobby. The exercise room was small and people could look in the windows at you. You have to walk passed the bar on the ground floor to get to the exercise room which is either a plus or a minus depending on your point of view. The back wall of the elevator has a psychedelic mirror.

<Content>Great Sevice and Location We stayed at the Jurys from Saturday-Wednesday. The service was excellent. The location is ideal for getting anywhere in Boston. It is a $24 (including tip) cab ride from the airport. I was traveling with my daughter and the first night they gave us a King size bed rather than two queens. There was not another room available until Sunday but they moved us as soon as a room became available. No inconvenience to us at all. The rooms are spacious and the beds are extremely comfortable. The housekeeping staff did a great job daily and turned down the beds at night. The blankets are wrapped between two sheets for those who enjoy this. Personally, I can't stand it if the hotels do not do this so notice it right away. The rooms have empty refrigerators which was great too. We were on the 4th and 9th floors during out stay. The pub in the hotel, Cuffs, was very busy on Saturday night but we did not hear any noise in our rooms as mentioned in other reviews. Our departing flight was not until 7:00 pm so the hotel held our luggage so we could get in another day of sightseeing. We had dinner at Cuffs one night which was very good and relaxing with the fireplace. We had breakfast one morning in the restaurant in the hotel too. Just a light breakfast which was ideal. Full breakfasts were available. Starbucks is two blocks away for those who need that kick. About a 5 minute walk. The subway stop is right beside Starbucks.The Consierge service was great. Take advantage of this service as they were all very helpful.The doormen were very friendly. (other than the one who couldn't pull himself away from playing solitaire on the computer) I would highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Wonderful hotel My Husband and I stayed here for 4 nights over Valentines day, our room was on the third floor, didn't have a fantastic view but wasn't awful. The room itself was lovely, spacious and clean. The bathroom was also a fair size and spotless. We did hear some construction noise from the left of the hotel in the mornings and also deliveries to the hotel as we were above the loading bay. The staff we encountered were friendly and happy to help. We ate in the Stanhope Grille for breakfast and for valentines day, the food was very nice, and the price was very reasonable for what you got. Cuff's seems to be the place to be, the bar was always packed and sometimes a little to noisy we went and sat upstairs in the hotel bar. The location of this hotel is excellant, everything is within walking distance. On the whole we had a fantastic time in Boston and we certainly come back here again.

<Content>How a hotel should be We decided to book our President's Day weekend getaway at Jurys after seeing the reviews on Tripadvisor. It is a terrific place to stay-warm, friendly, and good value, given that it's a centrally located hotel (near Newbury street) in downtown Boston. The hotel is tastefully decorated-the lobby is warm and inviting and there are ample public spaces in which to read and work. The rooms are smallish-we booked a larger room, which still measured only about 300 square feet but are very nice. What I like in particular is that Jurys does not bill you for little extras, that I think should be included as part of a hotel stay. For instance, in the room, there is free wired and wireless internet (as well as in the common areas, there are public computers and wireless access available). There were two waters in the fridge for free as well as two free milk-based drinks to help you sleep at night. There was a nice complimentary gym and friendly service from the front desk and concierge. For singles, there is a swinging bar on the ground floor which was packed on the weekend evenings. The food in the hotel is solid-the breakfast buffet is expensive at $18/person but that's fairly standard for most hotels of this quality. When I come back to Boston again, there's no doubt that I'll stay here again.

<Content>Great one night stay at jurys Excellent hotel. We stayed one night -- Sat. night -- on holiday weekend. We got a decent price -- im sure there were better out there but the hotel is very nice. Great front desk service, etc. The room we had was very small -- but nicely decorated and not a problem. The location was great. Ten minute walk to theatre. Lots of very popular clubs/bars close buy -- for the under 30 crowd it looked like. Jurys itself had a very crowded bar and restaurant but also a quieter lounge upstairs.Nothing negative to say at all.This will be my hotel in boston.

<Content>Great Stay at the Jurys Based on the reviews, the Jurys seemed like a reliable bet for great stay in Boston. While our stay was similarly satisfying like other reviewers experiences, I felt that it was a little overpriced for what you got - although it IS downtown Boston. The room was clean, very nicely appointed and had an extremely large bathroom with heated towel racks - a nice touch if you ask me. The bedroom area of our Deluxe King room was pretty small, however, but adequate. One disappointing feature of the hotel is the exorbitantly priced Valet. $40 per day, and all they do is drive it to the nearest private parking garage with whom they have a deal with. You would do yourself a favor by utilizing one of the THREE parking garages within a block of the hotel: (http://maps.google.com/maps?near=350+Stuart+St,+Boston,+MA+02116geocode=q=parkingf=lhl=ensll=42.350052,-71.071318sspn=0.001947,0.005021layer=cie=UTF8ll=42.35171,-71.071308spn=0.007786,0.020084z=16om=0cbll=42.350935,-71.070727)The hotel has an Irish Bar - Cuffs - and they serve up an amazing lobster bisque! The bartender even served up my Guinness properly - with a shamrock design in the frothy head. We had a mind to skip our dinner reservations at Grill 23 across the street and just stay here! Of course, we're glad we didn't, as the meal was tremendous at Grill 23 as well!

<Content>Great Stay This was my second time staying at the Jury's Hotel. The Hotel is in a great location and walking distance to wonderful shopping. T stops are also very close to Hotel which makes it easy to get over to the North End, or Cambridge. I was a little disappointed in my stay this time as the first time the service was fantastik, and this time the staff was not as eager to please. I had a few issues with housekeeping, but in the end they were resolved. The bar in the hotel, Cuff's is a terrific place to hang out. It is very busy with hotel guests and people who work in the area. Being a single person this is a great place to meet people and make new friends. The bar staff are very friendly and fun. Looking forward to staying again at the Jury's Boston Hotel.

<Content>Lovely hotel My husband and I stayed in Jury's Boston in December 2007 after reading the excellent reviews on the TripAdvisor web site. We were not disappointed. The location of the hotel is great. Copley/Back Bay is a great area with loads of shops, restaurants and very easy access to the T (one block away!). The service in the hotel was very good and the rooms were lovely. We ate breakfast in the Stanhope Grill and even though it was a little pricey, the food was good and the service excellent. One added bonus is the Cuff's bar in the hotel which is a very popular after work drinking spot so if you don't feel like going out in the cold you need look no further!Grill 23 across the road is a great steakhouse. We ate there the first night we arrived and although there were no tables available downstairs we got 2 seats at the bar and got an even more personal service. A great one to try. I would thoroughly recommend Jury's Boston for a lovely place to stay either for business purposes or with a family.

<Content>Perfectly Placed in Boston My husband and I spent our first 5 nights at Jurys as part of our 2.5 week Honeymoon in the US. I had made the booking having read previous reviews on this site, and I wasn't disappointed. The hotel was perfectly placed for getting around town, public transport is only steps away, but in general we walked to most of the places we wanted to go. We had a lovely room - clean and comfortable - with a good sized bathroom. The hotel itself is also well presented, clean and nicely decorated. The staff were friendly and helpful.There are loads of nice restaurents within walking distance, as well as the Stanhope Grille in the hotel (it was a little pricey but we got what we paid for - the food was fab). I would definitely recommend this hotel to fellow travellers and wouldn't hesitate to stay again myself if I were to return to Boston.

<Content>great stay at Jurys in Boston! We stayed for one night for a little weekend getaway in Boston. We chose Jurys based on the TripAdvisor reviews and weren't disappointed! What a lovely hotel, and the people who worked there were super nice and accomodating. We got a fantastic deal through one of the discount hotel websites, and when we called to ask if we could check in an hour early or so, they upgraded our room to a deluxe. The room was very nice, spotlessly clean and attractive, the bathroom was good-sized with very nice amenities, there was free internet access and a flat-screen T.V. The beds were super comfortable. There was a fair amount of traffic noise from outside our window (we had a room facing Berkeley Street) but I consider this just part of staying at a hotel in a city. The public areas are very attractive and kind of quirky, with lighting overhead, on the stairs, and on a waterfall wall next to the stairs that change colors from green to blue to purple to red, etc.There are very unusual gas fireplaces covered with sparkly stones (I know it sounds odd, but it looks great!) The trash containers near the elevators had a bowl of potpourri on one side ! We ate dinner at Cuffs, the bar on the lower level, and had a great meal of sandwiches and fries, with two awesome desserts which I would highly recommend (a trio of ice creams in cups made of thin cookies and a blackberry creme brulee). Prices were very reasonable.We had breakfast in the Stanhope restaurant, and it was very good, too (pricey, though-- if you don't order either the full or the continental buffet, where the beverages are included, watch out for the prices on the juices and coffee!).All in all, it was a great stay and I'd love to stay there again!

<Content>Great location and great hotel We only had one night in Boston after finishing a cruise and before we headed to the Florida sun. We chose this hotel for its location and the good reviews it had received. We were not disappointed. The hotel looked beautiful with all its Christmas decorations. The bedroom was very comfortable with fantastic beds and good bathroom. And even better high speed internet access was free. Staff throughout were extremely, especially in the business centre when we wanted to print documents out and scan other documents in 鈥?which was all done at no charge. (Watch out for the telephone charges though! )We ate at an excellent nearby fish restaurant called Skipjacks (Clarendon Street) just a few minutes walk from the hotel and had a memorable meal. There were plenty of other restaurants nearby if you want to venture out of the hotel.Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in the city and this hotel in particular. Certainly if we were back in Boston again would want to stay at Jury鈥檚.

<Content>Favorite Boston Hotel If I could stay anywhere in Boston, it would be at Jury's. Our first experience staying there was about 2 1/2 years ago, for just one night. Ever since then, whenever we have an occassion to stay in downtown Boston, we stay at Jury's. Immaculately clean, spacious marble bathrooms, and excellent location. Just across the street from Grill 23 if you are looking for a good meal too!

<Content>New Year In Boston Just returned from the Jurys Boston Hotel where we stayed for 4 nights over the New Year. Excellent location in the Back Bay area with a 5 minute walk to the Prudential Centre shopping mall and access to the ' T ' only 1 block away. The hotel is within easy reach of all the shops,cafes and restaurants on Newbury Street as well as the delightful Boston Common. The hotel is very welcoming and the bedroom was nice, large and clean. The furnishing's were nice and new and the bathroom was a good size with L'occatiane products and an impressive shower. The hotel bar, 'Cuffs', is handy for a drink after you've hit the shops and the food served there is very nice. We also ate in the hotels Stanhope Grill Restaurant on News Year Eve which was superb. We had breakfast there every morning and you could either order off the menu or have the full buffet breakfast that included bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs or the continental breakfast which included fresh fruit, yoghurt, pastries.We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel and time in Boston and will definitely return to both.

<Content>Character and location galore We had a wonderful stay. The hotel is lovely and has many details that I apprectiate. Interesting appointments and attention to small luxurious decorative details. It is small, but it is a city hotel with an old world feel. The bed was sumptuously comfortable. There are also small stylish details, such as note paper with quotes in the room, great bar and restaurant options onsite. Check in was seamless and all the staff including doormen were very helpful and pleasant.I was however diappointed that upon leaving I left behind an expensive and unique jacket that was unable to be found within hours of my departure. As we were leaving the room, the chambermaid asked us if we were checking out...unfortunate.

<Content>Close to Perfect We'd heard so many good things about this hotel but it still exceeded our expectations. I got a great deal through Hotwire, but would definitely pay full price to stay again. The service was perfect, the room was super clean, the bed was comfortable and the shower was great.

<Content>Excellent stay @ Jury'sin Back Bay Choose Jury's Boston primarily because of it's reviews here on Tripadvisor and have to give a big thumbs up up to all the previous reviewers. Couldn't fault the place on any front at all.This is one of Jurys's hotels as opposed to a Jurys Inn and the differece in class is immediately obvious. Rooms were large and well decorated and the bathroom and shower were especially well appointed. Staff extremely pleasant and helpful particularly the concierge and the front door guy. Food was top class as was Cuff's bar which was extremely lively every single evening we were there. Top class athmosphere and refreshments on offer into the wee small hours. The hotel is well located in the Back Bay area and within strolling distance of downtown and some of the city centre malls. Plenty of well recommended restuarants on the doorstep so you certainly won't go hungry.Free wi-fi all over the hotel if you have your own laptop and free regular internet connection on two Pc's adjacent to reception which was most heplful on our 6 day stay for making various bookings.Best thing I could say about Jury's Boston is that if I ever make it back to Boston I won't be wasting even a single minute looking at another hotel, I'll just be searching for the best possible rate for Jurys and booking it.

<Content>Good choice My daughter and I stayed at this hotel mid October and it was a really good choice. It is in a good location, just 3 - 5 minutes to the main shopping street. The hotel is very good, with lovely bedrooms and friendly service from front-desk to the dining room which is run by two women chefs. We will stay at this hotel again.On the surface, it appeared to be a really quiet area and hotel, but from approx. 4.30 p.m. the hotel bar just came alive with people meeting after work and others starting their evening. The surrounding restaurants were also very busy with lots of atmosphere.We only stayed two nights in Boston before going to New York which we had visited before. Two nights in Boston is not enough, it is a great city with lots of everything, but so much more refined than NY. We will good back to Boston again without a doubt.

From the cleaners to the concierge, from the minute you arrive they cant do enough for you.If you are looking for a hotel in Boston look no further.I am a Travel Agent and very rarely can find no fault with a hotel, but this one has made it through with no faults.

Special mention has to be given to the Concierge, a lovely lady who couldn't do enough to help. And Cuffs, the downstairs bar had a great atmosphere and lovely hot chocolate!

<Content>Mainly Excellent Stayed at this Hotel from 12th to 20th November inclusive. From arrival to departure all the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful, always willing to go the extra mile to make sure everything was OK. Special mention must be made of the concierge(s) to whom nothing was too much trouble. Whilst we had one of the smaller rooms this was comfortable and clean. Given that we were only using it for sleeping, it was entirely adequate for our purposes. The Hotel is modern, the decor is excellent and the public rooms good. It is ideally situated, close to Newbury Street and the Prudential Centre and Copley Place Even Downtown Crossing, Fanueil and Quincey market are all within a 15 - 20 minute walk. Given that we were there a week the charge of $27 for a Coffee Maker was reasonable.OK - what about the negatives. Our room was at the rear of the Hotel and was quite noisy, we were awakened every morning between 0530 and 0600 by garbage collection and deliveries. The much vaunted Cuffs Bar is OK if you beloing to the younger set and can tolerate 100+ Decibels, given the layout this noise also percolates into Il Barista upstairs. It also 'drove us' to eat out of the Hotel every night.Whilst we were there the staff in Il Barista stopped serving at 2200 hrs (no way did we want to venture into Cuffs) which in a Hotel of this quality is deplorable.The Reading Room is very under utilised - an oasis of calm which could be better used - tip - buy your drinks and take them there!For a Hotel of this quality to run out of supplies for the Coffee Maker, Corn Flakes and Bran Flakes is really not on.However all the negatives above should be taken in the context of - yes we would definitely return - a little more attention to the 'extra' bits would make this a really excellent hotel - Recommended.

<Content>Value Lacking The Jurys Hotel in Boston is a nice facility but the value received for the room rate is questionable. When you pay a top rate, you expect a top end experience all the way around and I didn't experience that at Jurys. It's what is missing that makes Jurys fall short.The good things:1) The rooms are very nice and well appointed. The tiled bathrooms are large and feature a tub plus a stand up shower with multi nossle sprays. I had no problems with water pressure. The radio system was turned on when I first arrived in the room which gave me the impression that this place is special. Nice touch.2) The main lobby has a lot of places to sit and gather with friends or business clients or just for a peaceful read of the morning paper.3) The staff was very eager to please and make the stay more enjoyable. I know a night manager came to a buddy's room at 1 am to make up a fold away couch.4) The bar and restaurant were nice and again everyone was eager to please.The missing:1) The main lobby coffee bar was not open and not operating in the am (or at all as far as I could tell) and the hotel was booked for the evening.2) There were no vending machines anywhere to get a soda.3) The workout room is a joke for this class a hotel. A few machines but no steam, sauna, or nothing.You get what you pay for and in this case, I felt like I was staying in a super elegant Comfort Inn and I didn't even get a free breakfast.

<Content>Not Nice Enough For the money Jury's was in a great location. Room service was good and the staff was nice. I only had a couple of problems. The water pressure was terrible in the shower and I didn't feel like I even had enough water to say I had showered. Second the temperature in the rooms is controlled by the hotel so no matter how I dialed the thermostat it was always at a set temperature the one they set! The coffee absoulutely sucked and they charged me five bucks for it. The rooms are small but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean.

<Content>good place but expensive for what it is I have stayed at the hotel four or five time since 2005 and actually quite like it. Especially the bar inside the hotel is a happening place and great for pre-dinner drinks. During the recent stay I found the hotel staff as friendly as usual but for some reason I felt it was time to try something else next time when I am in Boston. Reflecting on this I think that the Jurys simply isn鈥檛 anything special and I guess I liked it more a couple of years ago when I stayed there first. Now it feels just like any other big hotel with relatively small rooms and high prices. It鈥檚 a shame since nothing is really wrong with the place but on the other hand I don鈥檛 feel compelled to stay there anymore.

<Content>Beginning to fray This hotel is beginning to show signs of needing an overhaul in terms of its room quality. We stayed just one night there, wanting to be in a good location in central Boston. Couldn't fault location, but the room was small, the bathroom large, but the shower was barely more than a trickle. The hotel needs to upgrade its televisions, ours was not flat screen and the front flap was falling off. One of the bedside lampshades was stained and in general the upholstery in the room looked tired. I'd say this hotel needs to look lively if it is to retain its position as a ranking hotel.We moved to Jury's from the Westin Waterfront--on all counts apart from location Jurys fell short of the Westin. Overpriced and resting on its laurels--which very much need to be refreshed...

<Content>Jury's was good Stayed here with my teenage son from 20th October for 5 days during some unexpectedly warm weather. Really enjoyed our stay. Comfortable rooms, friendly staff, good location. Had 3 breakfasts which added to our costs but very enjoyable. Good restaurant called Laurel just next door in Berkley St. Would stay again.

<Content>Quality and Service at Jurys Stayed in a 5th floor corner room strretside. Was surprised to have minimal noise despite rabid BoSox fans enjoying the World Series. The staff- from front door to check-in and especialy concierge- were GREAT. Even the maid staff seemed happy! Couldn't recommend this hotel more.

<Content>Friendly and well run hotel We stayed for 4 nights towards the end of October 07 and enjoyed our stay at Jury's.We found the staff very attentive - they recommended good places forbreakfast and were generally very helpful throughout our stay.The room we had on the 9th floor was larger than usual and well decorated. The facilities were of much higher standard that we have experienced at other hotels.The location was good for us although it might not suit everyone. It was conveniently located near the Back Bay railway station so we could easily get the train to New York. It did not appear too difficult to get to the hotel from the airport using the metro although we were so tired after the flight we opted for a taxi in theend. It is a little way from the central area of Boston but it is an easy and pleasant walk through the common and there is the metro nearby orbus if necessary.Our only slight problem was the noise from the building work behind the hotel which started at 8am. We were usually on our way out at this time so not a problem to us. I didn't notice any internal noise as a previous reviewer reported.All in all a good place to stay and we would definitely return again.

<Content>Unbelievably loud I recently spent a weekend at this hotel and it was so poorly sound proofed that lying in bed you could hear every word uttered in the hallway, and in the bathroom you could follow the conversation of the people in the room next door. It was as if they made no effort to insulate the rooms from noise. For what they charge for a small room in this new hotel it is ridiculous they haven't done better.

<Content>Not much more to add Stayed here in september and really have little to add to the reviews already posted. Everything really good. Professional reception staff, excellent and friendly door men, very helpful barman who kept me right on American bar ettiquette when asked. No complaints about the room - spacious, clean and comfortable. For a modern non boutique hotel you could not really ask for much more.Well done Jurys.

<Content>Jury's is simply fantastic My husband and I actually got married at Jury's Boston Hotel, and it couldn't have been a more perfect experience! I found this hotel during Boston's restaurant week, and enjoyed dining at the Stanhope Grill (which is incredibly good.) After seeing how kind and accomplished the staff was, and how consistent they were at being so great, we booked the restaurant and 10 rooms for our big day. It couldn't have been a better experience, both the wedding and the hotel stay. All of our parents and family who stayed in the hotel had a fantastic time with great service and comfortable rooms. The larger two-double-bed rooms had a gorgeous bathroom, and our single-king was nice too. The room was spotless, and all the staff was super kind. If you want easy, friendly, elegant service that is better than the supposed-best hotels, than Jury's is the place. There's no finer property in town when you consider the whole package, and the location is superb. Considering I paid way over $10K for my wedding to be held here, I think every cent was well worth it!

<Content>A superb hotel We have just spent 3 wonderful nights in this excellent hotel. Its location is very convenient for most of the city's attractions. The reception staff/porters were extremely welcoming, and our room was delightful, very quiet, and had an excellent large shower. Although we did not sample the breakfasts, we did enjoy an excellent meal in their restaurant. Faultless!

<Content>Love Jurys Jury's was a great surprise. I accompanied my husband while in Boston on a business trip and I was extremely surprised at the level of service Jurys exhibited. Working for a 5 star property myself, I am usually disappointed in this department when traveling, but the staff at Jurys proved most helpful and always went out of their way. They allowed us to order from the restaurant menu instead of the room service menu from our room, they delivered my husband's lost luggage directly to us without us having to remind or call repeatedly to advise. The Irish theme and in room book detailing Irish-American histroy was interesting. Loved the restaurant, loved the decor, loved our room, loved Jurys.

<Content>Nearly perfect hotel! We took an east coast vacation for the first time, and were a little nervous about where to stay. We looked at trip advisor to give some recommendations. Jury's Boston Hotel was rated #1 on the list, so I thought we would give it a try. It definitely deserves the rating. It is a small, intimate hotel, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was really nice, but the bed was amazing! It was the most comfortable bed we have had in a hotel (I actually liked it better than my own!) The hotel is very conveniently located for people without a car. We were able to walk one block and get on the trolley for a great tour of the city. Lots of great restaurants nearby, great shopping. We had a great time, and would recommend anyone stay there that wants to be around friendly, helpful people!

<Content>Great hotel My wife and I stayed 4 nights at the Jury's, everything was great. The service was exceptional (especially Heather the concierge, who advised us on the best places to go to). We had room 738 a corner room over looking the street, the room was very large for a city centre hotel. The room was very clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable that we have ever slept in.I would recommend this hotel to everyone wanting to visit Boston.If you get a chance go to Grill 23 across the road from the hotel, best steaks you will ever have.

<Content>One of the Best At the price I was expecting someting well above average and was not dissappointed. The only possible let down was the restaurant on the Sunday evening, which was very poor. However, that was well made up by the genuinely friendly staff (yes there are a lot of very pleasent people in Boston - but some seems to be playing the part).We had seven nights. The room was made up almost as soon as we left it, so when we came back for an afternoon rest it was perfect. The bar Cuffs is excellent.recemmended

<Content>Geat Location / Good Atmosphere/ Friendly Staff The location of this hotel is just about right being halfway between Back Bay and the North End. The hotel room was large and comfortable , although our shower didn't work efficiently and I was unable to get it repaired in the 3 nights we stayed there. Having said that I would stay there again. The bar down stairs can get very noisey but there is an outside area to enjoy a drink should the weather permit. Breakfast although not include in our deal was o.k. and I would opt to use that rather than search for some where cheaper.

<Content>Good Cop Shop Nicely converted police HQ. Room not huge but Ok, would have preffered king size bed. Room very clean, good toiletries and huge bath towels. Slightly spooky TV that tuned onto the hotel entertainment menu when somebody in another room was trying to purchase adult entertainment! However, the front desk dealt with this very efficiently when contacted. Indeed all the staff we encountered were excellent. Good lively bar in the basement, really good atmosphere for a hotel bar and not expensive. If arriving by air use the subway, $2, and get off at Arlington and use the Berkeley Street exit which is just two blocks away. If arriving from the south by train get off at Back Bay station and turn right outside then first right onto Stuart Street. The hotel is on the right just five minutes walk. Enjoyed the stay, nicely located five minutes from the Common in a good area, slightly expensive but would consider staying again.

<Content>Good but surely not the best in Boston! This is a very good hotel without being brilliant. The rooms were nice but small. It is conveniantly located within walking distance of lots of great sites. it is astonishingly busy at night with an irish theme pub attached to the hotel. We were high up and it didnt disturb although floors below may have problems.Price wise it was expensive although no real complaints. A comfortable hotel although surely not the best in the city.

<Content>Excellent but Pricey I spent 3 nights with my family from Aug 13th. on a stopover en route back to London. I have a 9yo and a 15yo. The only gripe was that, while excellent, it was very pricey. The service was superb, although the room was not huge, (it is the converted Police HQ).If you can get it for a good price then I strongly recommend it, but at $275 a night it was not good value for money.Patrick

<Content>Can't Beat Jurys Stayed at the Jury's hotel from the 6th to the 11th with my wife and 2 sons one is 17 and one 20. We had a quad room which I must say was perfect, the sheets were turned down every night with a chocolate left on the pillow the ice bucket filled and complimentry water in the fridge. The staff were excellent being polite and very helpful. The hotel location is perfect for shops and eating from fast food to expensive. If I had to find fault it would be the price of the breakfast in the hotel but this is the same in every hotel I've stayed in so when we go back to Boston its the Jurys for us.

<Content>Loved Jury's Boston! We've just returned from a 6 night stay in Boston. We booked this hotel on Expedia based on the reviews from Tripadvisor, and they did not disappoint. Thanks to the reviews we were prepared for no coffee maker in the room (fine, we don't drink coffee anyway), and no tub in the bathroom (I asked, they have tubs in the higher category rooms and suites, it wasn't a big deal, the shower was fabulous, with 2 shower heads!). The turn down service at night was a nice touch and after the 2nd night we were getting 2 chocolates, not just one (there were 2 of us in the room). We found the check in staff a delight, very helpful with directions, storing bags etc. The concierge was great as well. The bonus of this hotel is location. Very close to shopping and sights. The restaurant is beyond good. We had a pizza that made me think I'd died and gone to heaven! Service was attentive but not hovering. Excellent. Yes, there was some construction, but we had an inside courtyard room, so it didn't bother us. The front desk told us if you find an Internet rate, they will honour it. Good to know for next time. And if we return to Boston, which we certainly hope to do, it will be Jury's all the way!

<Content>Very nice, friendly hotel. My daughter and I stayed here in August 2007.We arrived from CA at 7:30 am and by the time we reached the hotel it was still several hours to check-in. We did the paperwork and left our bags with the concierge and asked for an early check-in if possible. My daughter and I went to kill time having breakfast and shopping, but the concierge called and we were in our room getting ready to get a nap by 10:45am!!! The room was a king and on the small side but the bathroom was very spacious and nice. The carpet in the room could use cleaning. We stayed 6 nights and enjoyed the cool well decorated hotel. They turned down the bed every night and the bed was comfortable with crisp linens. Location was wonderful and very close to the T (metro)Newberry Street, lots of shopping, historical sites and restaurants.Daniel, our conciegre was awesome and helped us get situated and ordered tickets etc. VERY friendly and helpful staff.On check out our flight was scheduled to depart at 7:45 pm so the hotel gave us a late check out.

<Content>Another excellent visit This was our second time in Boston and second time at Jurys. Check-in staff and porters were as friendly, polite and helpful as we'd remembered them and the room (deluxe doubles, 9th floor) was spot on. I like this hotel because there is very little (if any) noise from adjoining rooms. However, here was a fair amount of noise from the street on this visit (commencing around 8am and continuing until tea time) because of a big building project going on just along Stuart St. If you are staying in the next few weeks I'd advise that you ask for a room that does not face onto Stuart Street.Some free tourist stuff for you: Fort Independance (South Boston),open at weekends only and easy to reach by T and bus #9. Historic fort with great tours, pleasant beach and views of harbour.USS Constitution is also free to visit and easy to get to. If you have a week saver T ticket it is also valid for the boat trip from Long Wharf to Charlestown Navy Yard at no cost. A great way to arrive. This is easily combined with a climb up the Bunker Hill Monument.My husband highly recommends the Samuel Adams Brewery Tour (few dollars donation requested). Trip round the brewery and a generous sampling session with souvenir glass (word of warning - children are admitted on the tour but not allowed in the bar where the sampling goes on). T to Stony Brook and a couple of minutes walk at most.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic Place.....book this now! This is one great hotel! It's located in an historic building which used to be the Police Headquarters for Boston, yet the rooms are ultra hip, modern, and very spacious. We booked this as the last night of a seven day trip to New England and wished we would have stayed here instead of the Fairmont Copley Plaza, where we had spent three days at the start of our vacation.The bathroom was the biggest one I've seen in years, marble, glass, and even a heated towel rack. It had a separate, glass doored shower with two shower heads, a separate tub and a gorgeous vanity. The bed was comfy and the place was quiet.We did have a drink in the bar (there are two) - one is crazy noisy - it's called Cuffs and filled with twenty and thirty-somethings. The other is a lobby bar, nice and quiet and sedate - more our style. In the morning they'll make you a latte or espresso too.Book this place...it's worth it. It was hundreds of dollars less PER night than what we spent at the Fairmont.

<Content>Great City Hotel We spent 5 nights in August in Boston, staying at the Jurys. We had booked the hotel through a travel agent. Upon arrival we were notified that we had been upgraded into a larger room. The room was very comfy and big enough to be in with three as we were travelling with our teen daughter. Overall we enjoyed staying at the Jurys, however, it was not flawless. The lobby area was less than inviting, the bar was nothing you would go to a second time. Housekeeping was not as we had expected. What makes it a great experience though is the location in Back Bay. We would certainly consider coming back.

<Content>Good hotel I would have given five points to this hotel hadn't been for its staff.It is a good hotel indeed. Rooms are giant and clean, beds are confortable, bathrooms are big and they provide wonderful bathrobes. The only but is the staff at the reception desk. Rude and unhelpful. Sorry to say so, they can't care less about their hosts.It's a pity that in a hotel with this level and price, employees don't make an effort. After all, it should be part of their job too.

<Content>Excellent hotel Can only reinforce what others have said. We arrived late after 3 flights from the UK, and were met at the taxi, bags taken, check in very quick, and upstairs in no time. Staff were helpful at all times-we asked the doorman where we could find a diner type place for breakfast-he directed us to Billys, 2 blocks past the Subway Station, which was simple but cheap and effective.I'd also recommend the Cottonwood Cafe one block along Berkley Street for good atmosphere and excellent reasonably priced food.

<Content>Nice hotel My husband and I just got back from a weekend trip to Boston, and we stayed at the Jury's hotel. It was a very nice hotel, and we didn't have any problems, but I must say that I am surprised that it is ranked the #1 hotel in Boston. that is not a complaint about the hotel, rather I would think that surely there are nicer hotels out there.The hotel is very nicely decorated, very contemporary and centrally located. It was clean and the service was very good. The concierge, Heather, was particularly helpful in recommending and booking dinner reservations. We ate breakfast in the dining room each morning and the food was very good. They have a nice breakfast buffet that I think was around $18 per person, comparable to any large hotel. The bar attracts a lively crowd, especially after work, and there is a nice outdoor terrace for when the weather is nice. Be sure to visit the bar area to see the police memorabilia (the hotel is a renovated police HQ); very interesting!Where the hotel lacks is in basic amenities...there is no coffee maker, no complimentary newspaper, no pool, no gift shop. It wasn't a huge deal to us, but one of the reasons I was surprised the hotel is in the #1 spot. The rooms are on the small side, and though we received turndown service each night, we found it amusing that they left a single chocolate each night, despite the fact that there were clearly 2 people staying in the room.We also thought that the bed was uncomfortable. When we first arrived, we loved it...you sink right in. Same with the pillows. However, sleeping on it is a different story...our backs were killing us because the mattresses are so soft. So, if you prefer a firmer mattress, this is NOT the hotel for you! Just a matter of preference.Here is another tip...the hotel charges $39 a day for parking, which I think is pretty standard among Boston Hotels. However, we did notice towards the end of our stay that there is a parking garage approximately a block past the hotel on Stuart Street that charges $12 for all day parking. It might be something worth looking into!Having said all that, we would consider staying at the Jury's on future visits. I think it would come down to price...if we could stay at the Marriott or Lenox at a better price, we'd probably try one of them.

<Content>great place to stay in boston we just got back form two weeks in the US, and stayed at the Jurys at the start and end of the vacation. It is not the cheapest hotel but everything about the place was excellent.The location was great, with walking distance to the shopping at Newbury, the Common, and the Theatre district.The service was excellent with lots of staff on hand to take care of everything from luggage to check in to room service. The rooms are luxurious, with all needed facilities , and there is a great bar downstairs with a cool atmosphere. So, overall it was an excellenet base for our days in Boston.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! We booked this hotel simply based on the reviews we read here and I have to tell you they are right on all counts!!! This is a GREAT hotel... My family of four stayed here Aug12th thru the 15th and had a wonderful time. The staff is great and the hotel is just gorgeous...centrally located and very near a subway stop(arlington off the green line...three stops from Fenway) The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept on at any hotel chain and the pillows...well there seemed to be a never ending supply of them laying around! The hotel is a decent walk (15 minutes or so) from the freedom trail and what I would call central Boston but for the price we paid(199.00 per night) it was a steal!

<Content>wonderful Great hotel for a boston getaway. Stylish, serene, impeccable details. My only complaint was having to leave in the morning. Be careful if you would like a tub and shower. Our corner king had only a shower, which was no problem for the night but for longer stays I would have liked a tub in the bathroom. Given the excellent attention to detail, I have no doubt that if I mentioned this to the front desk, we would have been moved without a hesitation to a room with a tub.

The lounge on the ground floor is Cuffs, with pictures of old Boston policemen. Very friendly and accommodating staff. The room was relaxing and peaceful.

<Content>Extremely good We spent five nights at the Jury's Boston. Arriving straight from the airport on a Saturday evening I was a little alarmed by the noise coming from the ground floor bar. However, once we had checked in and arrived in our room there was no noise at all despite being only three floors above the bar. The room was generous and very well appointed and beds were comfortable. Complimentary water was provided and replenished daily - and despite the summer humidity outside we were able to turn the AC off and enjoy a comfortable night's sleep. The only problem we experienced was a smell of cigarette smoke for the first three nights of our stay despite being on a non smoking floor. This was presumably coming from a neighbouring room but when I asked reception about this they sent someone up to spray the corridor with ioniser within ten minutes. Location is great, a short work from Copley Square and Prudential centre shops (all the NYC stores!) and Filene's Basement. Also recommend Smith  Wollensky steak house a short walk in the opposite direction (another NYC import!!).In summary, great hotel, excellent location and superb service. (Only criticism is no tea and coffee making in room!)

<Content>Solid 4-star experience The Jurys was a solid 4-star hotel experience. The service was unfailingly professional and friendly, from the bell staff to the concierge to the front desk. Our room, a deluxe with two double beds, was standard-size and was decorated nicely in a contemporary, neutral palette. The extra touches in the room that we appreciated were: free bottled water in the mini-fridge, a full-sized hairdryer that wasn't attached to the wall, Aveda toiletries, comfy double-sheeted beds with good-quality linens, a CD player, a fairly large television, a cool retro bedside clock, turndown service with chocolates, and 24 hour room service (with decent food, no less!) The only negative I can think of about the room is that there were no cotton balls or q-tips provided in the bathroom. It wouldn't have been a big deal had I not forgotten mine. I'm sure I could have called housekeeping and they would have brought some.Finally, the decor of the lobby was a little bit off. The hotel has a mostly traditional-to-contemporary feel, so I am not sure why the designer thought it would be a good idea to throw in some neon lights under the stairs and weird disco panels on the walls of the wood-paneled elevators. Dunno, maybe they were trying to make it look more trendy. I thought it looked out of place.Overall, though, a good place to stay and a good location for shopping in Copley and along Newbury Street.

<Content>Friendly Hotel We stayed at the Jurys Boston for four nights and chose it after reading the Trip Advisor reviews. We were not disappointed, the hotel has atmosphere, the staff are friendly, the bar and restaurant are well used and popular. The location was ideal for us, not too close to the centre but within easy walking distance of shops, bars, restaurants. Definitely a great base from which to explore Boston.

<Content>Style, Luxury and Amazing restaurant Stayed there 2 days while there for work and booked based on TripAdvisor Reviews. They were right! Beautiful, comfortable rooms, elegant lobby. Free internet off to the left of the lobby, in their business center (they have the computers, you don't have to have your own) and a large, very nice sitting room. Concierge and front desk were great. Restaurant on the high priced side (what hotel isn't) but exceptional and memorable. Crab Flatbread, strawberry rhubarb shortcake, gnocchi, salads, steak, all magnificent and original. Would absolutely be my first choice if I ever go to Boston again.

<Content>One of the Best Hotels we've stayed We travel enough to know a great hotel and this is it! The staff was A+. The atmosphere was A+. The rooms had such charm. This hotel was a former police headquarters and when they did renovations, they did so properly. The rooms were a bit small though. However, they take care of every detail in making you feel that you are their number one priority. We'll be back for sure!

<Content>Loved it ! One of the nicest hotels we've stayed at. It was a bit expensive, but very nice for a one night weekend stay. Great location, near restaurants, theaters, and subway stops. Super comfortable beds and pillows. Extremely quiet - often a pet peeve of ours at other hotels. A very nice restaurant for breakfast - I recommend the scrambled eggs. The only complaint I have, and I must dig deep, is the cost to park. After paying premium rates for the room, $39 / day seemed tough. With that said, surrounding public garages are $30-35 / day, so maybe it's not a big deal.

<Content>Loved this hotel! This was my first trip to the US and Jurys was a great introduction! The staff were all so nice and helpful, we got a phone call five minutes after checking in to make sure everything was ok. They really couldnt do enough for us. When I got blisters on my feet from too much walking and the concierge immediately arranged plasters for me. The room was perfect, the bed was really comfy and the robes were such a nice touch! The TV had loads of channels and it was great to have the stereo. Our stay didnt include breakfast, but we got it one morning and I would say it was great value, lots of selection and you wouldnt be hungry for the day after it!!Cuffs bar downstairs is nice and has a good cocktail list! I will definitely stay here again, no question and I will not hesitate to advise friends and family to do the same. It may be a little bit expensive but it is definitely worth spending the little bit extra.

<Content>Great hotel - modern, but large classical rooms Stayed here for 6 nights - a couple of days sight-seeing and 4 days on a business trip.Great hotel. In the converted police headquarters - so old building but very comfortable and modern inside. The staff were really helpful - had advice and help from the main desk and the concierge. Only 1 concierge on duty, so might have to wait to see him/her, that said spends a lot of time helping with queries and you really feel looked after. Lots of sofas and chairs off reception to wait in.Bedroom was very comfortable. Excellent bed and pillows, spacious desk (with free internet and plug-in cable(!) and free wi-fi). Bathroom had separate shower cubicle (although talking to colleagues at my business meeting, this was not true in all rooms, so might want to ask for room with separate shower, if that is important to you).Public areas very good - relaxed bar with outdoor seating area and breakfast (both restaurant and room service) were good.Liked it a lot!

<Content>Solid hotel with awesome showers Fun tacky lobby, pretty good staff, excellent room, particularly the walk-in tile showers. I'm so tired of $200+ a night hotels with standard 32 shower tubs and those silly curved curtain rods. Nasty Days Inn in rural PA use them - can't the better hotels find a classier solution? Jury's by far had the nicest (but not the biggest) bathrooms I've seen in Boston. Excellent fixtures, but best of all, the only walk-in tile shower in town so far. Otherwise, renovations, details, surfaces, everything was in excellent shape. Mattresses were very good, pillows excellent, clock radio was actually high quality. Room was very clean. Worth the stay.

<Content>Horrible Service While the room was very nice and very clean, the lack of service ruined the stay. The doorman was busy chatting with a valet and never acknowledged us. We carried in our own luggage. Later that night he actually stood in our way when we returned from dinner. Most hotel provide coffee makers in your room. Not Jury's. You can have one sent up for $27.00, or pay $5.00 in the lobby. This is insane. Where's the hospitality. The service here is sub standard. I would not stay here again

<Content>GREAT SPOT! I have stayed at Jury's Boston 3 times now as part of a semi-annual girls night. The hotel is in a perfect location for such an evening! It is right in the heart of the back bay and within walking distance to several fun spots although the downstairs bar is always lively and alot of fun! The staff is very helpful and the beds are very comfortable! You can certainly get better deals on rooms in Boston but Jury's is definitely worth spending a little more!!

<Content>Romantic, wonderful hotel The room was luxurious and romantic - double sheeted blankets, ample pillows, turn-down service with chocolates, ice container filled with ice in the evening. Loved the service. The folks behind the desk as well as the concierge were very helpful - where to catch the T, where to have dinner that night (happy to call for reservations), breakfast places other than their own wonderful restaurant, etc. Perfect location. Local restaurants that were a find for us included: Giacomo's (Italian - reasonably priced and rated well by Rachel Ray in a recent visit), and Charlie's sandwich shoppe for Blueberry pancakes (yum).

<Content>Where did the irish go? Beautiful property in a very good neighborhood. Decor, ambiance, it'sall there and my wife and I would probably be back - but first we're going to check out another hotel on our next trip to Boston. This wasour first with an overnight stay, and I was looking forward to the Irish hospitality and the attentive staff that other reviewers were raving about. I know Irish hotels from the New York City, and they have (mostly) irish staff. However, if I were irish myself, I would probably opt to spend the summer in Ireland too, which is where we both thought the Jurys hotel staff had ventured off for. We met literally just 3 irish during our short stay, and the attention otherreviewers got during breakfast, dinner and the rest, well, it just wasn't quite there.The room was very nice and clean but needed some maintenance (tear inthe bed linens, scratches on furniture, not entirely scrubbed down shower stall).Jean, the valet, was the one and only bright spot during our stay. Hewas upbeat and really enjoying his work: welcoming guests. All in all, we left with mixed feelings, so next time we'll check out some other hotel unless the Jurys has a good deal going because otherwise this is a good place to spend the night and have few drinks at the bar.

<Content>Wedding night stay My husband and I stayed at Jury's on our wedding night, before we took off for our honeymoon the next afternoon. We weren't there long enough to visit the bar or restaurant, but the hotel was wonderful. When I made the reservation, I explained that it was for our wedding night, and when we checked into the room (late at night), we found a bottle of champagne and some chocolate truffles in the room waiting for us. We had a very nicely appointed room, and we were glad to be able to sleep on a VERY comfy king bed! The bathroom was big and really nice, as was the shower. Also, thought that the heated towel racks were great. The only bad part of our stay was that they were doing some construction on the street right below our room which woke us up and it was way too loud for us to fall back to sleep. Nothing to do with the hotel though. It's in a great location in Boston and we were within walking distance of many stores which allowed us to get a few more quick things for our honeymoon before heading to the airport. I'd definitely stay there again based on our short stay there!

<Content>Saturday night stay We went to Jurys for a bachelorette party. The hotel was beautiful. The staff very nice. The room service food was gross. We had chicken tenders and french fries at 2 in the morning and they were totally disgusting. The location is great though, walking distance to everything. Very nice time.The rooms were smaller than average, the bathrooms were beautiful but only a shower no bath.

<Content>Will stay here again I was very impressed with the Jurys, especially considering the price. It was less expensive than the Boston Marriott Copley Place, where I stayed when I visited Boston last year, and I preferred both the large room and the general location just a few blocks from Newbury Street. As a frequent visitor to Boston, I think this will be the hotel I stay at from now on!

<Content>Jurys Boston - First Class Stay for mid range price We had to stay one night in Boston to conduct some personal business, but wanted to make the trip somewhat social and fun. The Jurys Boston Hotel certainly made the accomodation part of our stay hassle free. The hotel is the former Boston Police Headquarters, and has been tastefully remodeled (except for the funky mirrors in the elevators!). Our room with two double beds was first class, not too small as some reviews have said. Three adults stayed comforably, though we admittedly packed light. Free internet service was both wired and wireless, and easy to connect to. The beds were comfortable, and the bedding was changed as requested prior to our arrival (due to a down feather allergy). The hotel allowed us to check in early (which they do not guarantee but will try to accomodate). The bathroom was large, with nice modern decor. It featured a large, walk-in shower with dual shower heads. One of my few minor nit-picks was that water leaked out at the base of the door and soaked the bath mat (not a deal breaker). The room included a lockable safe, mini-bar, iron, hair dryer, robe and umbrella for your use. The hotel has a nice restaurant (The Stanhope) and bar (Cuffs). We had a drink at the bar and watched sports on the big screen TVs. We had breakfast at the Stanhope the next morning. It was of the usual big hotel price ($7-18), but I have to say I did not regret the price-convenience trade off because it was EXCELLENT.The location was VERY easy to find by car, right off the Mass. Pike Prudential Center exit. It is close to Copley Square, Newberry Street and Boston Common.My wife recently stayed at the Four Seasons in Boston, and although she liked it, said it had nothing over the Jurys (which was ~$200 less per night). We love going to Boston, and do not get there enough. Next time we DO go, it is almost certain we will stay at the Jurys Boston hotel.

<Content>Pleasant stay at central location This hotel with a busy Irish bar is centrally located in the Back Bay area, just minutes away by foot to Copley Square, where you鈥檒l find lots of sights (Prudential Center = tallest building in Boston), shopping opportunities and restaurants. Even the bus stop for the city bus tour (Hop on, hop off) is within 5 minutes walk reachable, adjacent to the Hard Rock Caf茅.Our spacious room used for 2 nights on the 2nd floor had twin bed, due to fire regulations the hotel doesn鈥檛 allow an additional rollaway bed for the 3rd adult, just used extra-sheets/linen. Room had inroom safe, free WIFI, Iron board, and a spacious bathroom. Service was good and helpful, easy-going atmosphere in the hotel. The breakfast buffet with sightkitchen costs $16.-p.p. and was just ok, nothing fancy or spectacular. The fitness room had a running band, crosstrainer, weight machines and dumbbells. We absolutely enjoyed our stay at this hotel in this beautiful city.

<Content>Average Size Room, Above Average Service I stayed at Jury's for business on May 1, 2007. While traffic getting there was badly snarled by the Red Sox game, the hotel was more than worth the trouble. As we checked in, the staff was very accomodating and went the extra mile to make sure all of our needs would be met. My room was smaller than a lot of hotels I have stayed at before, but very well appointed. The bed was very comfortable, and all the pillows one could ever need were provided. The stereo was playing some soft music when I came in, which at first spooked me (did I just walk in on someone?!), but once I realized I was alone in my room I appreciated the comforting touch. The bathroom was very decadent, with a separate tub from shower, marble flooring, and more shampoos and soaps than one could possibly use in a night! The heated towel rack was a wonderful touch that I'm going to think about adding to my home. The full body shower head was great after a long car ride. The room would have been cramped for more than 2 people, but alone it was perfection. I would love to go back again. Every member of the staff said, Hello and anytime we needed help, any staff member we spoke with was eager to help in any way they could. They were all friendly, and not the average snooty types that you often run into in finer hotels. Thanks to all at Jury's for a relaxing stay.

<Content>The Jury has Reached a Verdict!!! I was in town for a conference and the convention hotels were booked. I made a reservation at Jurys on Travelocity; the price was steep: it averaged $340 per night before taxes. For that price I expect something special....Location: Excellent; within an easy walk of the Charles River, Back Bay, Copley Square, Newbury Street, and Hynes Convention Centre.Check-in: Fast, friendly, and accurate. Top notch in fact.Room: Small but nicely appointed. No view. Large modern bathroom with heated towel racks (nice touch) and high quality soaps and shampoo (but nothing exceptional). Beds were very comfortable. TV and stereo were excellent. FREE INTERNET SERVICE IN THE ROOM: YAHOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Only downside with the room: slightly stained carpeting.Concierge: knowledgeable and friendly.Business Centre: Excellent and responsive.Hotel Bar: hopping and busy.Check-out: Efficient, friendly and accurate.Overall impression: an excellent business hotel, well run, and friendly, but not a five star experience.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! We stayed at the Jurys in Boston for 4 nights in April 2007 and found everything about the hotel to be fantastic. The location is really good - close by a T station, near to loads of bars and restaurants and within a 15 min walk of Quincy Market and the central Boston area. The rooms are well laid out and the service was excellent. I would recommend the hotel and are already looking forward to returning. The people of Boston were so friendly and it is one of the nicest cities we have visited and excellent for shopping and eating out. One slight disappointment was when we were leaving the hotel the door man recommended we take the hotel transfer service to the Airport for $25 which we took for convenience. When we arrived at the Airport the driver charged us $35 ($40 including tip) which was a bit pricey for a 10 min drive and not what we had been quoted prior to setting off. This did not spoil our stay though - we just know to take the taxi next time.

<Content>Great Hotel for your stay in Boston Just returned home after a 10 day trip to the USA and to say this was the best of the 3 hotels we stayed in would be an understatement. Rooms were very clean and well furnished, beds and pillows were brilliant, felt like you were lying on clouds!Bathroom was very spacious and it had a good shower. Bar down on basement level was very busy and lively but once you went into your room you never heard a thing. Would recommend this hotel to anyone going to visit Boston.

<Content>Boutique Hotel near to everything! Booked the Jurys Boston Hotel online for three nights and got a last minute 15% off - so that was a good start. When I arrived, the room was not available. The staff was MOST apologetic and had another room arranged for me at a hotel a couple blocks away. Of course, the paid for the first night - and gave me an upgrade on my next stay.The service at the Jurys Boston is excellent - the staff know what they are suppose to do and do it in a friendly, professional manner. The hotel was, I believe, a former police station and has a very solid feel to it and is tastefully - and not overly - decorated. The rooms are generously spacious with all amenities in working order, including the complimentary Internet service. The lack of an in-room coffee maker with a selection of teas, coffee and other hot drinks, however, was bit of a disappointment as this was expected in a hotel of this caliber. The location is excellent - near to Newbury Street, walking distance to the Commons and Downtown and stone's throw away from the Prudential Centre. Overall, a very good experience and definitely recommended for those who prefer the smaller hotels

<Content>Excellent service at Jurys, Boston We stayed at Jury's Boston at the beginning of this month for 3 nights. Everything about our stay was excellent - especially the room and the attention given to us by the staff - all of whom were very friendly and helpful. When my husband and I were checking in, other members of staff were showing my teenagers the map of the area etc. We booked Jury's because it came up as the No1 choice on tripadvisor. It absolutely deserves this ranking.The room was large, beautifully decorated with a superb bathroom. We ate in the bar downstairs which was very good. The hotel staff were extremely helpful in organising a trip to the outlet shopping mall (highly recommended - the coach driver provides extra discount vouchers which make up for some of the cost of the trip itself - really good value).If you're planning a trip to Boston, you can't go wrong with Jury's..

<Content>Fantastic Hotel and staff We arrived in Boston after 5 nights in a crap hotel in NYC and a 4 hour journey on the Greyhound, to a foot of snow on a bitterly cold day, To be welcomed at the Door by warm friendly welcome , a tosty warm fire and friendly staff the hotle was perfect and we wished we had bough along our swim wear and took advantage of the faciliites. The room was tasteful, clean and fresh , lovely shower room with Aveda products, lovely fluffy dressing gown. Perfect, the room was so nice one afternoon we booked a film out and watched it in the room!Good location central, friendly staff , a definate must if you are staying in Boston. Price was excellent too! Will look to stay in Jury - Doyles chain again.

<Content>Eloquent Once the top cop shop (HQ) and recently converted to a very eloquent hotel with very very friendly staff. Has a charm which most of the big chain establishments lack. Good location on the edge of Charming Back Bay just a 3 minute walk to Newbury Street, Copley Square and Arlington T stop and 10 minutes to Downtown. Hotel restaurants and bar in the basement are excellent and worth a visit even for non residents although there are dozens of great places to eat within a few minutes walk. Not for the budget traveller.

<Content>Very nice Jury's is a nice hotel. The lobby is beautiful. It's in a fantastic location too. The bed was ok, a little firm for my liking but the comforter and pillows were nice. The room was actually very small and there wasn't a lot of room on the sides of the bed. I liked how the room had a CD player. Bathroom was nice. Good, but not great, water pressure in the shower. I didn't have to pay for the stay, but it seems like the prices are good compared to other hotels in the area so I'd probably stay again. However if I could I would opt for the Marriott or Westin because I know Marriott beds are more comfy, and I've heard the Westin beds are comfy too.

<Content>Fantastic stay!! I have just returned from an 8 day stay with my mum. We booked the hotel purely on the strength of reviews read on here and weren't disappointed.The rooms are very well appointed, we had a large two double bedded room with shower. As stated by many previously, the beds are to die for!!Its the little touches that make this hotel stand out. The complimentary bottles of water each day and newspaper. The ice and turn down service and the exceptionally friendly staff.The Stanhope Grill food is worth the higher than norm prices as it is was one of the best meals we had during our stay. Equally the bar food is reasonably priced and very tasty.There is nothing we could fault about the hotel and highly recommend it.

<Content>St. Patricks Day magic We were unable to travel to Ireland for St Patricks Day week, and decided that 5 days in Boston would be the next best thing. And where else to stay but in an Irish owned hotel ! The Jurys Hotel was splendid in design, trendy yet warm and cozy. The staff was polished and personable. The rooms decor was stunning, the feather bedding and crisp linens devine! We also must mention that we had the BEST full Irish breakfast ever, and this is no casual comment since my husband is a Dubliner. Thank you so very much for the grand time. We have resolved to spend next St. Patricks Day with you , along with some friends and family to share in your wonderful hospitality. Your delighted guests, Michael and Carolyn Foley. P.S. Thanks for the magical snow storm on 3/16.

<Content>Fabulous hotel with great service On our way back from skiing in Maine, checked in on a FREEZING cold night with plans to walk to a restaurant in Copley Square. Instead we checked out the bar area of the Jurys, which seemed to be the place to hang out. Nicely dressed crowd of interesting people. Ended up ordering dinner off of the bar menu. The lobster bisque was some of the best I've ever had. Reasonably priced menu and great atmosphere. The decor at the hotel is very modern, nicely appointed and boutique-like and the rooms, although not oversized, are comfortable. Great mattress and the shower was heavenly. Wish we could have stayed longer.

<Content>Great Hotel After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, we booked our reservation with this hotel. The staff could not have been any more helpful and friendly. The room was wonderful. It had a comfy bed, tons of great pillows,blackout curtains, stereo, two complimentary waters and big bathroom. The room was very clean. We loved our stay at this hotel.The only negative was our room was close to the elevator so it was not very quiet and the doors slam shut so loudly that it woke me up several times. I would advise getting a room at the end of the hallway on the side away from the street if a quiet room is important. Other than that, it was a wonderful stay.

<Content>Average Having read many of the good reviews for this hotel - I felt compelled to write about my experience. I left the hotel disappointed. The positves were - nice comfotable bed, tastefully decorated and well designed rooms and the location is fairly good.The disappointments - poorly sound proofed rooms, doors with 1 inch gaps at the bottom and top of the room doors, at times you feel like you are in the corridor with the passing guests and room doors that shut with such force that they would wake the dead. Never really understood why hotels insist in placing stereos in guest rooms when their rooms are poorly sound insulated. Only two lifts and the queues can get rather long. The bar though popular is under staffed and the resturant is over priced and the food lacklustre.I appreciate that many people have had a good experience at this hotel, however my experience was not that great. I travel extensively with my job and expect better from a hotel that has set high standards in many of its other hotels.I am back in Boston in two weeks time and I will be trying another hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel I am from Boston and now live in CA where my wife is from. We visit Boston a lot and try to stay in different places. We've stayed in just about every area of the city at least once by now. I ranked this hotel excellent in the context of the price. The location is great. It is very clean, modern looking and had a bunch of nice touches thrown in that other hotels either don't have or want to charge you for (free internet, large-screen tv, dvd. etc.). The bar in the lobby is a lot of fun and all of the stafff was great.You shouldn't expect a four seasons experience, but you won't pay that either. I read someone complained about the room being small. Ours was not. Sometimes I find if you book through expedia or hotels.com you do end up with smaller rooms. I booked with the hotel's website and found a good deal. While Ill keep trying hotels for the experience, once I start to repeat, this will be the first on my list.

<Content>Wonderful!!! My husband and I just got back from a one night stay at the Jurys Boston Hotel. I've been a Trip Advisor member for years now and have never felt compelled to write a review until now. This hotel was the best in Boston that we've ever stayed at. The staff was great and the rooms were nicely appointed and very clean. We loved the heated towel rack!! I could go on about all the amenities and the little things that made the hotel so great, but you just have to believe all the rave reviews because they're true. Kudos Jurys and keep doing what you're doing!! We'll definitely be back.

<Content>Perfect in every way... We made reservations at Jurys solely based on trip advisor's reviews, and it did not dissapoint. Why would anyone stay anywhere else in Boston? We are used to staying at the usual 4 or 5 star, especially Four Seasons, and I would put Jurys right up there. Frankly, I don't see the point of why you would pay an additional $200+ per night to stay at the Four Seasons, because all the amenities are the same as well as the service is above and beyond excellent. A couple of weeks before we arrived I spoke to Richard, the guest services manager about some restaurants and other things we wanted to do, and I guess I had mentioned that it was my wedding anniversary. To our surprise, upon our arrival, we had a beautiful display of champagne, chocolates and fruit awaiting us in our room. I don't even remember that I told him that, but he remembered! So, yes - we would definitely stay there again if ever in Boston, and you should too!!

<Content>Great location for a wonderful visit We stayed at Jurys in late September and really enjoyed the hotel! Our room was nicely furnished and very clean -- and the bed was super-comfy. The bar downstairs was a great place to hang out early in the evening, but was crowded later on by the young hipsters. Great location puts you a short walk to Newbury St. and other great sights. Highly recommend.

<Content>Great Hotel This is a great Hotel in Boston, the rooms are large and comfortable (the bed especially) and are well soundproofed.Cuffs bar which is downstairs is a lively, atmospheric place to enjoy an evening and is obviously popular with locals.What also impressed me was the quality of the staff at Jurys, who were all extremely friendly and helpful, (especially Jean or John the doorman) at big hotels this is not always the case, but here, the staff seem to be well trained and happy to be at work.We found the location of the hotel to be ideal for our needs because it was near to bars, restaurants etc and also very handy for the T if you wanted to venture further afield.We love Boston as a city, and when we return we would not stay anywhere else than Jurys.

<Content>We loved it! We booked the Jury鈥檚 Hotel for our first trip to Boston on the recommendations of other Trip Advisor travelers  we were not disappointed. Hotel was lovely. Very clean  smart (as you'd expect with a new hotel I guess). All the staff were very helpful  friendly (especially the concierge at finding a pub that was showing the premiership games over the new year period!) Our room was spacious and well decorated with enough storage space for clothes, cases etc. The only negative we found was the lack of lights. There were several lamps and up-lighters, but in the main bedroom area, no ceiling light, great for effect, but a little impractical at times.The onsite bar, Cuffs, was a great place to unwind. It serves good food and gets quite lively near and on the weekend Location wise we found we could walk everywhere. Minutes to Copely Sq  Prudential Centre and only around 15 -20 min walk to Quincey Market.We will definitely be going back!

<Content>Great Location, Good Service My husband and I stayed in at the Jurys Boston Hotel over a weekend in mid-December. Overall, the hotel was nice. We enjoyed the plush furnishings and nice attitude of the staff. The location was great for site-seeing, shopping and was near a lot of wonderful restaurants. However there were a few caveats which keep this hotel from remaining a 5 star.~ We had to choose between a bathtube and a shower, we could not have both. ~The restaurant was expensive (30$ for breakfast) and the bar was so packed everynight we didn't have the opportunity to try it out.~The doormen were always talking and never opened the door for us, and we had half our luggage unloaded from the taxi before they stepped up to help us. This isn't a big deal, but it is their job.Overall, the hotel was nice and I would definitely go there again when we return to Boston in April.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Just back from a week long stay at Jurys Boston Hotel. Hotel was in a wonderful location, within walking distance of major sites, and for those further afield ,taxis were cheap and underground even cheaper!The rooms were comfortable with 2 queen size beds...not ideal for sharing tho! CD player and TV were a bonus as everything was closed on Xmas eve and Xmas Day. Hotel Bar was open tho which helped. My only negative about the hotel was the over priced luke warm food served at the bar!! The morning buffet breakfast was 16 dollars p.p. (but well worth the extra money.) There was also a great diner around the corner from the hotel where breakfast was a more reasonable 6 dollars p.p.The hotel staff were extremely helpful and obliging (one waitress was very unfriendly, but she was only there on Xmas eve so didn't upset me too much). Nuala was a wonderful wealth of information..thank you!I would definately stay here again. Loved being close to Hard Rock Cafe and great shops on Boylston Street

<Content>Enjoyed Jurys! I really enjoyed my stay at the Jurys hotel. The location is good, it's not too close to any one thing, but keep in mind that Boston is really quite spread out. It was easy to walk to the malls, restaurants, etc. I was very happy with the cleanliness of the room. Staff members were not overly nice when entering the hotel, but I think that's because there is a bar on the first floor which gets many non-hotel guests. Once the doormen recognized us, they were friendly. The hotel is decorated modern and pretty. There were guests of all ages staying there. We ordered desert from room service one night; i got a Blue Cheesecake (which to me was blueberries). Once I took a bite I realized it was actually blue cheese cake. Big difference! The staff removed the cake from the bill.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great staff, All round Big Hitter Stayed at Jury鈥檚 Boston from 25th December to 1st January 2007. After arriving at 8.00pm we were met by the staff in a very friendly manner 鈥?they couldn鈥檛 do too much to help. Room was on the 9th floor and very comfortable. Both room and bathroom were of a good size and equipped with all required amenities other than tea/coffee making facilities which we did really miss, especially with jet-lag on the first few days. The location of the hotel is very good as it is two blocks from Copley Square, and a few more blocks to the Prudential Centre. Newbury Street is also 3 blocks away where the designer boutiques such as Cartier, Valentino and Jimmy Choo located. We used the nearby T station to get around, but when we returned to the airport, we simply asked the concierge to organize a taxi for us. Cuffs Irish bar on the ground floor was very reasonably priced 鈥?similar prices to outside of the hotel and comparable to UK prices. The staff again were very friendly and helpful. Food was served very quickly and was standard pub fayre 鈥?if you are looking for anything other than traditional American fries etc then this is probably not the best place to eat, although they do recommend some really good restaurants close by 鈥?the concierge can make reservations for you. One in particular was Davio鈥檚 Italian restaurant 鈥?just one block away and a really good break from fries and burgers 鈥?we can highly recommend the tagliatelle Bolognese. We can also recommend the hotel for morning coffee in Il Barista on the first floor 鈥?much better than Starbucks (two blocks away). Other good restaurants in the area are 鈥楶appa-Razzi鈥?鈥?again an Italian restaurant with very good Bruschetta as an appetizer 鈥?one is enough for two people 鈥?don鈥檛 try the calzone though unless you have a poor sense of smell. Kashmir Indian restaurant on Newbury Street was also really good although service could be better. They tried to take away our starter plates before we had even finished 鈥?this was different from the usual standard in America were we usually end up with our main courses before we have even finished the starters.Hired a car for a few days 鈥?car rental itself is reasonably priced but beware of Valet parking charges as it cost $40 each night and there was no option of self parking 鈥?other car parks around were similarly priced.

<Content>Nice Hotel in Good Location We stayed here for 5 nights in October as part of our honeymoon from Ireland. We really liked this hotel. The only issue we had was that they never even mentioned that we were on honeymoon. We did not get upgraded our receive anything which from other friends who have been on honeymoon we were kind of epecting as the norm! But it was a lovely hotel. Great bar food, breakfast, concierge, room, shower. No complaints. Its in a great location. My husband and I had a fantastic week exploring our old haunts from our student days in Boston (even if a lot of them had gone!). Great hotel in a great spot! Enjoy!

<Content>loved it I stayed in jurys from the 1st of November until the 5th 2006 I thought the hotel was excellent. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was quiet big and very clean. The beds very comfortable always got a good nights sleep in them. The hotel was very close to all the shopping areas and restaurants and the staff were very helpful and guiding you to all shopping areas. It was excellent that the hotel organised a bus to bring us to and from the shopping outlet in Wrentham.Staying in jurys Boston made my trip to Boston very enjoyable

<Content>Back to Back Stays I stayed in this hotel for two nights commencing December 26, 2006. I checked out on the 28th, but business required that I stay another night - so I checked in for a second stay on December 28.I found the hotel generally lovely. The room, while small, was very pleasant, with top shelf finishes - elegant window treatment, interesting lamps, very nice bathroom (large walk-in shower only) with two nice bathrobes and a very good hair blower. I found the bed comfortable. I was not told that there were complimentary waters in the refrigerator - would have been nice to know. I thought the Irish bar did not feel very Irish, but other than that, it was a nice stay and when I checked out I remarked to the front desk staff that I was looking forward to another stay. Little did I know that I would be there back that night. Here's where the review gets mixed. The room was actually dirty - a bottle of hand creme overlooked on the floor under the sink, papers overlooked on the floor under the desk. There was only one robe, a this robe can be bought notice hung from an empty hook. The bed linen had a hole in it (see review below) and there were hairs in the bathroom. The walls are thin and I heard a child crying nearby. On the positive side I ordered room service at 10pm, asked if I could get breakfast, and was sent the most perfect light dinner of two eggs and french fries (with two sodas - $30). Breakfast the next morning in the restaurant was very good - although in an otherwise totally empty restaurant we were initially given a tiny table for two. I have stayed in many Boston hotels and I can see why this is well-regarded. It looks new but I understand it is a couple of years old.

<Content>Excellent hotel We stayed at the Jurys hotel for 3 nights in December and thoroughly enjoyed the break. The hotel was clean and well maintained and all staff were courteous and friendly. A call to our room by the front-desk staff 5 minutes after our arrival to check everything was ok was a nice thought. The location is excellent - close to shops, restaurants and tourist attractions.The room was well laid out and a reasonable size. We didn't experience any noise-related problems. Complimentary water was provided in the fridge, and mini-bar snacks could be requested - in fact you can pre-arrange for your favourites to be present in your room upon arrival.Cuffs is a pleasant, typical hotel bar with decent service and surroundings. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant is worth the extra money and offers a good selection.Wireless internet access is available throughout the hotel for free, and the business facilities including printing are also free (handy for printing out airline boarding passes!)Whilst the front-desk staff could not accommodate our request for late check-out, they efficiently organised the storage of our luggage allowing us to make the most of our last day.It should be noted that using the T subway from the airport is pretty easy - especially as the Arlington station exit has been moved from Boylston/Arlington to Boylston/Berkeley during renovations - a stones throw from the Jurys.

<Content>Disappointing After reading the many good reviews here, I was disappointed in my stay at this new hotel. Location is convenient for walking to restaurants and shops.The staff seemed to be running to a script, with little real warmth; barely a hint of a smile. The first impression, when I entered the place, was the smell of chlorine. There is a waterfall underneath a stairway, which for some reason, smelled like a swimming pool. I heard others remarking too.The room was an OK size but was crammed with furniture, so you had to creep around avoiding hitting doors or chairs. I'd have taken a smaller bed for more space; and I am not a large person! CD player was a nice touch; giant tv not needed. Air was very, very dry and we both had sore throats by the morning. Bed sheets had holes. There was a fridge, empty but for 2 bottles of water, but no tea/coffee-making machine. These are mostly small gripes but for a fairly new hotel...

<Content>Lovely hotel We booked this hotel based on the excellent reviews it received on Trip Adviser and we were not disappointed. We found the rooms to be comfortable and very clean. The staff were always very helpful. The only negative thing we would say with regard to the room was that we found that it was nosiy - we seemt to be able to hear the traffic quite abit and you certainly would not be able to sleep with your window open, but this would not stop us from staying there again. This is certainly a beautiful city and one that we were comfortable walking around at anytime night or day. We would now like to return in the fall to see the beauty of it then and to go whale watching. If you decide to visit don't forget your walking shoes because that it is certainly the best way to enjoy the city.

<Content>NO IRISH HOSPITALITY AT JURYS! this hotel is very stylish beautifully refurbished and well located. unfortunately management is pompous and arrogant and did not address the needs of a disabled guest or freezing room and non working thermostat as well as maid disturbing room at undesirably early hour the morning of departure when we clearly had not vacated. did receive half-hearted apology via email although management alleged neither of two guests reported problems to reception although acknowledged reception gave contact details for management. no further follow up. nothing! credit card company had to deal with matter and after 2 months' investigations in which management sent letter to credit card provider requesting guest contact hotel directly to resolve management response was that it was too late to do anything - already paid. sorry. bad public relations disabled or not! very disappointed considering pristine reputation of jurys' in ireland and uk. no 'irish' hospitality at this hotel!

<Content>Jurys' a jewel in Boston's crown I selected Jury's in Boston due to the reviews it had received on Trip Advisor  we were not disappointed. I went for a shopping weekend with my 2 elder kids. We shared a room with 2 double beds  there was ample room. the rooms are delightful the beds just what you need after a day's shopping! The Aveda products in the bathroom are a real luxury.We ate a few times in the Cuffs bar - the food is delicious  the atmosphere great. The only problem is that it is very popular  on Fri  Sat evenings it is heaving. The location of this hotel is excellent. 5 mins walk to Boston Common, 10 mins to Downtown Crossing (Macy's)  about 10 mins to the Prudential Centre. Nearest tube is about 2 mins away. If you are looking for a great quality hotel in a brilliant location you really won't go wrong with Jury's in Boston. A delightful hotel in the wonderful city of Boston.

<Content>Great Hotel This is really a great hotel. I was here for several nights and was thoroughly pleased with everything. The hotel staff was accommodating, friendly and efficient - from the front desk, to housekeeping, room service, to the bellman. The rooms and bathrooms are clean and comfortable and even with a family staying in the room next to mine - with two small children - I did not hear a thing! The only minor complaint is that the room doors slam shut if you're not careful - however, this has more to do with the other guests being conscientious. I would highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Great Getaway Weekend My husband and I stayed at Jury's from 11/18 to 11/20 to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. We only live about fifteen miles away from the hotel but wanted a getaway experience. I booked the hotel based on these reviews and I was not disappointed. We traveled by the T (public transportation) and only had to walk one block from the Back Bay station. Upon check-in, we found the front desk staff to be very friendly, Actually, everyone who works at this hotel is very friendly. When we got to our room we were pleasantly suprised by chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne. Soon after, the front desk called us to make sure we were happy with our room, and we were!!! The room was an adequate size with a big, comfortable king sized bed! We loved the bed and the large bathroom with Aveda products, very impressed! The shower had great water pressure and we liked the added heated towel rack. We went to the bar area for a late lunch/snack and were very happy with the ambience and service, We both ordered delicous mushroom soup and split an order of lightly fried calamari while watching college football on their two flat screen televisions. After going out for dinner, we returned to a very crowded bar scene but we lucked out and were able to get two seats at the bar. Some people have criticized the crowd but we found it to be very electic. The next day we wanted to stay in bed and enjoy the Patriots so we ordered room service which was very good (same food as bar and same price) The room had a good sized flat screen tv and a mini cd stereo system. We also liked the mini-fridge b/c we could put some of our leftovers in it! That night we were meeting friends to go see a show at the Coloniel Theatre and we could easily walk there. Actually, you could easily walk to a lot of places from the hotel. We were both very happy with our choice to stay at Jury's. The next time we want to play tourist in our own city, we would not hesitate to return to Jury's and we would make sure we eat at their restaurant (we will actually be back next time we are in that area) If you are a tourist, not only is the hotel beautiful and clean, AND the staff very friendly, it has a GREAT location. Highly recommended!!!!!

<Content>it deserves its great reputation My wife, her sister, husband and I stayed at Jurys for four nights from 15th November 2006We booked the hotel solely because it was the top rated hotel in Boston on this site. We booked using a website called travelax which compares the prices on lots of different sites. It saved us 拢140 over Jurys own site which promises its prices cannot be bettered.I have stayed in hotels all over the world and can honestly say that this was as good as any I have stayed in. The hotel has all the amenities you could want (except maybe a pool). The rooms maybe not the biggest but you would have to be very fussy to complain about the size. The beds were extremely comfortable and all rooms had a good hairdryer and an iron and ironing board. They also had a free safety deposit box. But what set this hotel apart from the others I have stayed at was the staff, we checked in with Kimberley she was polite and certainly made no difference because of the way I had booked my room. She was genuinely friendly and made a point of saying hello when ever she met my wife or me. But the person who really made our stay was Richard the Concierge he was knowledgeable, friendly and patient. He made all of our restaurant reservations and even phoned around various shoe shops to try and find the Heelys for my daughters. We went to the Cheers Bar and they DIDN鈥橳 know my name but when we got back to Jurys the waitress in the bar said how was your day Mr Green that said it all to me. . To sum up this is a great hotel made even better by the staff.

<Content>Perfect in every way We chose this hotel on the strength of reviews in Trip Advisor and can only add to those by saying that it lived up to its reputation. It is perfectly located, beautifully maintained and delivers excellent service with an unerring pleasantness and warmth. We have been recommending it unreservedly to anyone I know who is considering visitig Boston.

<Content>Ideal location We chose the Jury's Boston because of the reviews on Tripadvisor and were delighted they were right! There were several comments on Tripadvisor about the bed, well we certainly agree. The bed and pillows were so very comfortable that since I have been home I am dissatisfied with my own bed. The room was not huge but it had loads of closet space and the shower room was a good size. The tiled floor of the bathroom was very slippy if you were not careful, but the large fluffy towels and bathrobe made it feel very opulant. I would advise any traveler who likes a morning cuppa to take a travel kettle with them as I had to ask for one as they do not included a kettle or coffee maker as standard in the rooms. However they did find me a coffee maker for our stay, but that doesn't make the best hot water for tea (I know I am a typical Brit). The staff were very helpful and we enjoyed watching the locals in Cuffs bar downstairs. We were able to get to everywhere we needed within Boston from there. We had been to the Streisand concert at the TD Bankworth stadium and felt very safe returning to the hotel late.

<Content>Lovely hotel in great location My Mum and I stayed at Jury鈥檚 Boston from 14 鈥?18 October to celebrate her 60th birthday. Overall the hotel was lovely, the staff were polite and friendly and the food was excellent.The room was kept to a very high standard and had all the extra touches eg Aveda toiletries, iron, powerful hairdryer, safe, complimentary water and turn down service (with chocolates!). The only disappointment with the room was that it did not have tea/coffee facilities although we understand this is often the case in America.Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was excellent although we would suggest that you go for either the Continental or Buffet breakfast as this includes both tea/coffee and juice. It can work out quite pricy if you order individual items. Cuffs Bar downstairs was always very popular and lively and the service was always good even though it was often very busy.Location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing, shopping and all amenities. Very close to Boston Common, Theatre District, Duck Tours, Newbury Street (for shopping) and Prudential Centre.Would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Just loved it ! We stayed October 12- 17 and had a king corner room no. 338 and it was wonderful and worth the $$$. Great sized room, great shower with all the attachments and Aveda products. Heated towel rail great especially for drying smalls ! Lovely robes and big towels too. Bath very shallow though. Great location can walk everywhere ! Boston has more sirens than NYC though ! Great big comfortable bed and a huge bonus is free access to the internet in the business centre ! Lovely big lounge to sit in, great breakfast in restaurant and Au bon pain my favourite too ! Will be coming back ! Spacey, friendly and fun ! A classy place to stay.

<Content>Nice hotel....very good stay My husband and I were first time Boston travelers. Read reviews on this site and decided to stay at Jury's for three nights. Glad we did. Hotel is in a nice location....close to shopping on Newbury (2 blocks) and 3 blocks away from subway T stops. Easy walk to Prudential tower area. Hotel was very clean and very well maintained. Rooms a bit small however this was expected. Bathroom was updated and spectacular with Kohler fixtures, huge shower and Aveda products. Turn down service each evening. Nightcapped each night at the Irish pub located downstairs....very nice crowd. Only thing I would have additionally enjoyed in room would be complimentary coffee service.....even though both Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks were a block away! Would recommend hotel and would definately stay again.

<Content>Good Hotel I found this hotel here on TA and booked it based on it's reviews.It's a very pleasant hotel in a very good location for seeing Boston.I wasn't sure what to expect as far as room size. Many reviews here mentioned the rooms being small. I thought the room was a fairly good size. It was nicely decorated and the bathroom was very nice.I'm not sure how this hotel got to be number 1 here on TA though. While it was nice enough I can't imagine that it is the nicest in the city. It wasn't inexpensive so I don't think of it as being a great bargain. It was a fine hotel that delivered. I would stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel We were doing a 5 city holiday in the USA and Canada, Boston and Jurys was the first chose. I booked this hotel through expedia, which was excellent, it gave me all the infomation I required to made a good decision to book this hotel. This room was with 2 queen beds and of very good standard, although the view was not good (this did not bother either of us as the exploration of Boston was the proirity) the room was very clean and tidy and housekeeping was excellent. The beds were very confortable and the bathroom was of good standard. The staff were kind and friendly and the Cuffs bar downstairs at the hotel was good. The hotel was in an excellent location to explore Boston (which to me is a good walking city) and if I did return back to Boston I would stay at this hotel again. very good keep up the good work.

<Content>Small rooms I stayed here for a long weekend, just as the city had a snow blizzard. The room was one of the smallest rooms I'd ever stayed in and the view from the room was over the offices of the building it backed onto, for the price I was charged I felt cheated. The cleaning was to a high standard and towels changed daily. The reception and other staff were polite and the room service was good.The food in the restaurant was first class and the waitresses equally so, but too expensive for anything other than breakfast which isn't even included in the room price.I'd stay in boston again but not here, this hotel is set up mainly for business travellers and the prices reflect that.

<Content>Superb Hotel in a Superb Location We stayed at this hotel for four nights and could not have been happier. The lobby is tastefully appointed and fun with a waterfall that begins on a wall and flows under the main stairs.Our room was clean and well appointed. It could be described as small, but with the very high ceilings and clever use of space, we never felt cramped. It is obvious that a lot of money was spent in renovating this building and the room was very comfortable.The location of the hotel can't be beat, we walked everywhere, including Faneuil Hall with no sore feet. Public transportation also is close by. I recommend you stay at a hotel in town and walk or use public transportation as much as possible, parking is quite expensive.We will definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>A Great Boston Hotel! My friend and I stayed three nights in July. We booked through the hotel's website. It was not cheap, but it was FANTASTIC! Check-in was extremely efficient and friendly. Our room had 2 queen beds, a seperate shower and bathtub......beautiful and clean. The restaurant's breakfast was above-standard buffet fare. The basement lounge was hot and happening. The gym was small, but adequate. The concierge desk was helpful. The location is extremey convenient. The $289.00 rate was comparable during the busy summer season. Skip the mega brands and check into Jury's!

<Content>Count me as a regular! From the moment we pulled up in a cab our experience was top notch. Even though thier computers went down our check in was a breeze. At check in they said they were out of non smoking rooms but were able to find one for me.The room was sparkling clean. Beds turned down with music playing on the cd player and ice in the bucket. The Aveda bath products were a nice touch. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable.The room was very quiet. I was sure we were the only ones checked in except for an occasional Red Sox fan in the elevator.The bar Cuff's is quite a happening place with lines forming outside at night. This is my only negative. The night we checked in we went for a cold one and a late snack. The service was very good. The next night we met friends there and our waitress was non existent, at least at our table. She spent her whole time catering to a table full of young guys. I had to ask another waitress to order some appetizers, and I also went to the bar to get our beers. It was crowded but she serviced the guys table which was right next to ours three times.The next night we went to the lounge on the second floor. It's very comfortable with sofas and tables and quiet enough to catch up with old friends. The woman working the bar was outstanding. She appeared at our table every time a friend joined our group. Each had a cocktail within minutes of entering. She should give a customer service lesson to the waitress downstairs.Everyone of the staff (except as noted) was exceptional. Don't hesitate to book here.

<Content>Wonderful The reviews on this website led us to choose this hotel. From the glassy entrance with wall waterfall to the comfortable beds we didnt want to leave. The staff were most friendly, the hotel is really stylish and it centrally located for everything. The breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of items. It was spotlessly clean. CDs players are in the rooms and free bottles of water are provided every night. We didnt have a bath but the shower room is something I plan on modelling my own shower on. Fabulous!! If visiting Boston I will definately go here again.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I have stayed in a Jury鈥檚 hotel in the UK and it was basic and functional so I wasn鈥檛 expecting to much when I turned up at Jury鈥檚 Boston Hotel. Checking in was a breeze, the check in staff were friendly and very helpful. The room was immaculate and very well appointed. A huge bed, big TV and even a mini music centre with a CD player and radio. The maid would come round in the evening and offer a turndown service, fill your ice bucket and leave you chocolate! When you leave your room in the morning a copy of the Boston Globe is waiting outside your door. The room had a fridge which had two complementary bottles of water left in it each day.There was a concierge desk in the hotel which was very helpful and had plenty of information on things to do in Boston although the Grayline office is only a 5 minute walk away. Copley Square is only a block away and Boston common is just over 5 minutes walking away.The hotel is located in the old police headquarters and the bar that is attached to it is an Irish / police themed bar called Cuffs. We drank in there most nights before going out into Boston. It鈥檚 a little expensive (about $11 for two beers) but it has a great atmosphere.This hotel was excellent value for money; I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Great hotel! Just returned from a five night stay at Jury's and we have to agree with the rave reviews. Hotel is in a great location, about three blocks from the T and four blocks from the Public Garden/Boston Common. The staff is very nice and accomodating. We had a few problems with our room, noisy A/C unit and door that wouldn't lock (!), but both were fixed promptly. Two waters were put into our empty (which was very nice) fridge every day, a GREAT amenity. Cuffs, the downstairs bar was very fun. We had a drink outside on the patio one night and upstairs on the other nights when Cuffs was full. They warned us at check in that there could be lines to get into the bar and there was! Although it was not a problem to get into the hotel at all. The only reason we didn't give the hotel five stars was the size of the room. I believe we had a standard room and the bed area was cramped. The desk and chair were right next to the bed and there was almost no room between the two. On the other hand, the bathroom was huge. Also, if you stay on a weekend, you need to tell them that you want a paper or they won't deliver it. We were not told this and did not get a paper on Saturday and we almost missed the Red Sox game. The time was changed from 7:05 to 1:05 the night before and if we had the paper we would have known.All in all, this was a great hotel and we will stay here again and would suggest Jurys to other travelers.

<Content>Jurys Boston Hotel - A Delight We just returned from a two-night stay at Jurys Boston. We booked a standard room, which was cute and cosy. The location was great, enabling us to walk to the Museum of Fine Arts and a Red Sox game (the purpose of our visit), as well as many other interesting sites. The entire staff was welcoming and friendly. We plan to return in the winter for more museums and good food. We will certainly stay at Jurys again.

<Content>Great hotel with history Stayed on 8/31 for one night in a corner king room. Great location, great room, great bathroom, unbelieveable bed. Loved the Aveda products. The hotel is the old Boston Police Headquarters building. They did a beautiful job with this property! Definitely my new hotel in Boston.

<Content>Maybe we can stay longer next time? On vacation for 3 weeks I tried to spend 200.00 a night on lodging, Because of a Microsoft conference in Boston when we were visiting, hotel room rates were higher than nornal. We booked Jurys for 2 nights at 350.00 a night. Luckily we were then able to get a room at the Hyatt in the Financial District for under 200.00 (another trip advisor review).I booked a non smoking room but because our flight from California arrived late and we checked in after midnight, all non-smoking rooms were taken and we were given a smoking room. You could smell the smoke in the hallway the minute the elevator doors opened. We were moved first thing in the morning to a non smoking room which then made our stay at Jurys more pleasurable.This hotel is first class all the way--from location, courteous staff, and luxurious rooms. Even though our first night was not ideal, I still rated Jurys excellent. If we return to Boston, we hope to stay at Jurys longer, especially if we can get a more reasonable rate!

<Content>Comfortably Modern in a Great Location We stayed here over a weekend for 3 nights from Aug 4th to 7th in a Superior King room booked through an online site about a month in advance. Before tax, each night averaged Cdn $200, a great price given what the hotel has to offer.The location is fantastic. Situated in the Back Bay, it's about a 5min walk to several subway stations (Back Bay, Copley, Arlington) on both the Green and Yellow lines -- giving you a choice of starting points depending on where your destination is. The hotel is about 3 short blocks to Copley Square where the beautiful Trinity Church and Public Library are found. It's also just a 5-10min walk to a number of other destinations -- including the Prudential Centre, Newbury St. (great for shopping and late night dining), and the Public Garden. Anywhere you can't walk is an easy 10-15min subway ride away.The room was very clean, relatively spacious, and warmly modern. It featured a wide entry area, with a large double-door closet and oversized full-length mirror. The comfortable king bed was flanked on one side by a bedstand, and on the other by a large desk. This work area would be great for business travellers (with a rolling office chair, and free high speed access). One corner of the room had a side table and chair for reading. The TV was housed in a large wooden wall unit with lots of drawer space, a CD stereo (CDs can be loaned from the concierge), and a small fridge, great for storing drinks and snacks -- and which they stock with 2 complimentary bottles of water each day.The large marble-tiled bathroom featured a granite-topped wood vanity with lots of counter space, plus an additional glass shelf under the mirror for overflow. The tub was fairly small, but clean. Toiletries were Aveda, the towel-rack held oversized bath towels and was heated (didn't seem to do much for the towels, but a nice touch!).Other amenities included: Large in-room safe, ironing board and steam iron, bathrobes, umbrella for rainy days, two clock radios on either side of the bed, and a full-sized hair dryer. For turndown service, staff fill your ice bucket, leave chocolate on the pillow, and turn the stereo on to classical music.The room was very quiet, never once did I hear any hallway noise. The downstairs sitting areas were very comfortable and in the mornings you can grab breakfast treats and coffee at the Barista Cafe. As others have noted, the lobby bar is very busy, but wasn't a problem where we were staying (9th floor).We easily checked our bags for a few hours on the last day, before setting out for Back Bay station to take the subway to the airport (40 mins door to door -- at $1.25 an economical option if you're looking to save on cabs!).Overall, this was a great hotel in a convenient location. I would not hesitate to stay here again if looking for lodging in the price range that I paid.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel We stayed at Jurys from Aug 1-4 and would highly recommend it. The hotel was very clean while the rooms were modern and quiet. The staff was helpful and the kids loved the chocolate every night when they came to turn the beds down. The location is about a 10 minute walk to Boston Common/Public Garden and it is also close to two T stops. The hotel bar can get quite busy as many locals come there in the evening but it was never a problem as it is located downstairs so you can easily avoid it if you choose.

<Content>Fabulous Experience Boston Jury's takes you back to service that's not often seen these days. From the welcome of the doorman, the quick luggage service from my cab to my room and the wonderful air of personal attention, you can't go wrong with this hotel. Had a superior king, never wanted to get out of bed and the shower with additional jets is to die for.Wish I had more time to stay, but plan on returning as soon as possible.

<Content>Great hotel, highly recommended Stayed at Jury's Boston for a few nights in July. Really loved it.. staff are extremely friendly and location is perfect for shopping  exploring Boston. Had a Superior King Room and it was so comfortable and lovely decor. The lobby  bar are also impressive, I was expecting more old-fashioned Irish style but it is really modern and great atmosphere too. Would highly recommend for visit to Boston!

<Content>Great Hotel, But Hotel Bar ain't quiet ! We recently visited the Jury's Boston Hotel on Honeymoon and here are my thoughts on the service and experience that I received.In terms of being a honeymoon couple, I did not feel that Jury's went out of their way to make the trip more special. A Congratulations would have been nice ! However, that may have been down to the person on the desk that particular day.The hotel itself is very nice and clean, very modern and the rooms were also very nice as well.In terms of the location of the hotel- very good.The only downside that I can think of is with regards the bar in the hotel. Cuffs Bar is a nightspot for young revellers in Boston. Not a problem if you are young and up for a good time. But if you are wanting personal service from the hotel bar whilst in Jury's, this is not the place for you. There are queues at the weekend to get in the place and the service for getting drinks and food was very poor one night we were in. young couple out for a good time and doesn't mind noise then Jury's is for you - maybe i am just getting old !In weighing everything up, 4 out of 5 would be a fair rating.

<Content>Amazing Experience My boyfriend and I stayed at Jury's for a long weekend and we were absolutely amazed when we walked in to the hotel. Everyone was so nice and accomodating. Concierge, the bellyboy and valet were all equally pleasant. The rooms are gorgeous. We stayed in a standard queen size room, which included turn down service, heated towel rack and complimentary water every day. Room service was impeccable. Everything was clean. The location is perfect. We walked through all of boston. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to boston, families, singles. Its a beautiful hotel with very luxury accomodations. You wont be dissapointed.

<Content>Great rooms and service I was a bit hesitant about Jury's as it used to be an old police station or something, but I really was pleasantly surprised. From first entry, service and friendliness was notable. The rooms were wonderful, really comfortable - luxurious - the bathrooms were particularly impressive with their double nozzled shower heads. The extras like body lotion and shampoo was of a great brand and nearly 8 months later I am still using the same bottle very sparingly. Excellent location to shopping malls and fantastic restaurants. Also really appreciated the Irish employees (i think?) which gave the hotel a special touch. Highly recommended!

<Content>Fantastic! There is nothing negative to say about this hotel! Great staff, fab location (in the nicer back bay area of the city with boston common, prudential centre and Newbry street shops all close by as well as easy transport links to the rest of the city via the T from Back Bay station), big rooms with a handy fridge and comfy dressing gowns! The daily complimentary bottles of water were a great touch...especially in the 90 degree heat of the summer!!Quite simply one of the best hotels I麓ve ever stayed in and I would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to Boston!

<Content>Couldn't fault it. Never been to Boston before so selection of Jury's was a bit of a gamble. Needn't have worried - staff super, food great, room excellent. The best hotel on our 4 week trip across the US. Also very convenient for Amtrak's Back Bay Station - couple of minute's walk away.

<Content>Really good location We visited Boston on a busy week and found this hotel on the TripAdvisor site - the hotel was really good - rooms good, clean and bathrooms fairly spacious - my only reservation was that there was no bath to relax in after we came in from our long walks. The downstairs bar was busy and there was a good atmosphere in the hotel in general. I would certainly recommend it to my friends.

<Content>Jury's is a sure thing I recently stayed at the Jury's Inn in Boston and enjoyed every minute of it. Friends had raved about it as the 'latest thing' and while I wouldn't go that far, it was certainly a solid choice. The rooms are nicely appointed with comfy beds, spacious bathrooms (sep. shower and bath) and a practical work desk. Highspeed internet is free and Cuff's Bar downstairs is cozy. What really makes the hotel is the people. The staff are very pleasant and go out of their way to help you (I was unsure of the disabled room I was given when I checked in and within minutes was moved to an adjacent room) but the other guests are also interesting. Jury's is a UK chain so there are a lot of British and Irish guests staying here. All very entertaining.So while this isn't exactly cutting edge in terms of concept or execution, it really delivers a very warm and friendly Boston experience.

<Content>Superior Value For a Major City This is a new hotel, which is something I tend to look for because of the furnishings. It truly is a fine place. Big marble bathroom and a nice interior decorations. The toilet area was a little cramped but the place is on a quiet street and it was about $190 per night. Hard to get much better for this type of Hotel on the east coast. Nice staff overall. The breakfast buffet was good but a bit pricey. It is about three blocks from the T. Not bad but that part of the city is like a wind tunnel and COLD in the winter. If they can keep it in good shape I would return in the future.

<Content>A wonderful place I stayed at Jury's in December of 2005. I had not been to Boston for many years and did a lot research before choosing this spot. It was easy to get to (off the Mass Pike) and I happily let them valet park my car, I did not want to worry about it while in Boston.The room was lovely, very comfortable bed, nice linens and a beautiful bathroom with all the trimmings. I ate dinner in the restaurant that night, fantastic! Later on when my friend arrived from CO via Logan, we got him something to eat at the bar, also great. The bar was quite full for a weeknight, nice scene (a little yuppie but friendly).Breakfast there was fantastic, our waitress was super friendly. We checked out but left our bags behind while we wandered the city for hours. The staff was excellent, the room beautiful -- the whole experience was outstanding.

<Content>Very pleasant stay Arrived at Jury's to find that our reservation had not been received from Virgin Holidays even though we had an accommodation voucher to present to them with all the details. Manager came out to deal with it and advised that they sometimes go astray if they are received by fax. Not really a good excuse!! Were then given a smoking room (having requested non-smoking), as it was the only one available. After changing to a non-smoking room for the following night the stay improved. The hotel is very well presented and service was generally good. Rooms were a little on the small side and decor in browns and greens did not help. However, room quality was high, bed was very comfortable and shower was good. Location was good for all main attractions. Very close to Newbury Street Shops, the parks and Back Bay Station. Would stay there again but would confirm booking in person in future.

<Content>Good Hotel, but.... My husband and our 2 teenagers had booked to stay for 5 nights in Jurys, due to a change in our travel arrangements we arrived 1 day early and asked that if there was a room available, could we extend our stay. The receptionist was extremely nice and said she would have to speak to her manager who stayed behing closed doors, on her return we were told there was 1 room in the hotel available that we could have at a charge of $350. Double what we were paying for the following 5 nights!Room was quite small but comfortable, and we did get a telephone call to ask if everything was to our expectations - coffee machine would have been nice for $350 - so one promptly arrived.Excellent location, staff very friendly and helpfull, and very popular bar.On the down side, my daughter had a nose bleed during our penultimate nights stay and got some blood on the sheets and pillows. These sheets were not changed for our last nights stay, the room was quite dusty and not all the toiletries were replenished on a daily basis.

<Content>Going above and beyond is customary here! The insanity surrounding the Boston Marathon could put even the best hotel through it's paces. However the staff at Jury's did not even flinch, coming through in spectacular fashion on our second stay here in as many years. We inadvertantly left the Do Not Disturb sign on our door the day of the race. At 6PM we sheepishly asked if we could have our room made up at this late hour. They never hesitated to satisfy our request. After returning from dinner the room was perfect. The beds are as comfortable as you will find anywhere and the oversized bathrooms are a welcome sight. The bell staff, concierge, and front desk are all very attentive. Only negative was a waitress in the lounge who was more interested in watching Extreme Home Makeover than serving us our dessert, which took 30 minutes and the lounge was virtually empty.

<Content>Excellent Experience At Jurys! My wife and I are back from a wonderful weekend at Jurys. I can happily confirm the positive commentary previously posted and add some of our own.Location is ideal. The hotel is in Boston鈥檚 Back Bay area, one block from the John Hancock building, a couple of blocks from Newbury  Boylston, a short walk (20 mins approx) to Faneuil Hall. Getting to the hotel is easy by car. It has about the easiest access to/from I-90 that you could ask, and they have valet parking (about $36 with unlimited in/out).Service is excellent and friendly. Jean at the front door was helpful and very enthusiastic about the city. The same goes for Keith at the concierge desk, who pointed us to several excellent restaurants in the North End  Cambridge. Turn-down and room service were prompt, professional and friendly.The room was most notable for its bathroom. We had a 鈥淒eluxe King鈥?room. The room itself wasn鈥檛 particularly large, but the bathroom was quite big (nice separate shower  bath tub). The bed was too comfortable, causing us to sleep through our morning agendas. We did not have much of a view at all (some rooms likely have beautiful views given the location).The bar/restaurant were hopping while we were there; great if you want to join but the noise was somehow contained so that we were only as aware of it as we wanted to be. We saw several couples with young children and thought the hotel was just fine for families. We had breakfast in the room one morning; it was as good as any other room service breakfast we鈥檝e had. The gym was a small room with limited equipment. The wireless signal was strong and worked perfectly all weekend. The hotel gets the intangibles right (complementary bottles of water, surprise Easter eggs on Easter Sunday, a call to the room to be sure everything was ok, etc). Overall, we felt the hotel stood between a Fairmont and a Four Seasons in terms of overall service, features and attention to detail.

<Content>Far better than New York My wife and I stayed in Boston for two nights after a week in New York. The Jurys Copley Square was far superior to New York's Waldorff Astoria for 30% less! The conveniene was critical to enjoying all Boston had to offer. What's more, the rooms were new, clean and full of amenities. Parking was pricy at $36/night but the staff's eagerness to assist us offset any concerns. Highly recommended.

<Content>Very nice hotel My girlfriends and I stayed at Jurys for 3 nights and we were not disappointed. The service was friendly, efficient and respectful at all times. Our room was spacious, the washroom was large (we enjoyed the heated towel rack and Aveda products)and the beds were very comfortable although we would have been happier with two queens rather than two doubles. As first time visitors to Boston we found the location excellent - we were able to walk almost everywhere and felt very safe going to and from the hotel after dark. I would definitely return to Jurys!

<Content>Great place Was there for a conference April 2-6th and was very impressed with this place. Had a king. Nice sized room, LOTS of pillows. Wonderful turn down service, with music on the in-room CD/radio player set to classical station and chocolates on your pillow; fantastically large towels on heated towel holders; wonderful robes; complimentary umbrella in the closet (which sure came in handy, unfortunately); comfortably appointed modern lobby and two free internet stations (though the rooms are equipped for internet access I didn't have a laptop). In-room refrigerator. Within easy walking distance of BackBay station, Boston Common, 20 minute walk to Quincy Market.A nice location, nice staff, I highly recommend Jury's!

<Content>Friendly Staff A group of us stayed at Jury's this past weekend. Excellent location. Staff was very friendly and service was far above expectations. We had two rooms which were across from each other but we could close a private door to close them off to the rest of the hall. Bar very busy, a huge line outside waiting to get in, we're not sure why? Only complaint is that we got spoken to when we first arrived as we were all in one room talking at 730pm??? Will definately stay again.

<Content>Class I stayed here for 3 nights with my wife. I would rate it as one of the best Hotels I have ever stayed in. The Bar Cuffs served the best Pint of Guinness I have ever tried in North America. Breakfast was tremendous. What made our stay so memorable was the staff, courteous and efficient especially the Manager who was around the bar entrance at the Lobby each night (think he is from Donegal). Tip: Bar gets quite busy - it is definately one of Boston's IN places.

<Content>Loved Jurys  We went for St. Patrick's Day and loved it - great hotel, great food, Irish Heritage is wonderful and the bar is wonderful! The rooms are nice and modern and elegant. All of the employees were overly helpful and the service was great! Will definitely go again.

<Content>St. Patty's Day This was by far one of the best hotels. Close walking distance to all major sites- Boston Common, Freedom Trail, Legal Seafood.The rooms are a bit small, but well appointed. Rooms were very clean with tasteful decor. Staff is fantastic. The Stanhope Grill restaurant downstairs was great. Breakfast was delicious. Eggs Benedict with Irish Bacon! The Cuffs bar was great and serves food until 2am. Must try the Buffalo Shrimp!This was our first trip to Boston and we will definitely be back- and we will stay at The Jury's.Our stay was so impressive, I am also writing a letter to Jury's Corporate; Dan, the Hotel Manager, is a keeper!

<Content>Warm Repception Absent I booked my stay in Jury's Boston based on the excellent review posted on trip advisor. It was clean, modern and in great location for shopping and sightseeing, however the staff were extremely rude at times. As the weather was extremely cold and my companion and I were out and about all day on foot we dressed for comfort rather than style. We soon discovered that level of service from staff was dictated by what we were wearing, as we were often ignored and disrepected by some of the staff. It seems we did not fit the image the hotel was hoping to project. On one occassion while I was wating in the lobby for my friend I was rudely questioned by female staff member as to why I was sitting in lobby. These experiences made it an uncomfortable stay at times and we got the distinct feeling that we were not wanted in the hotel. We will not be making a return visit to Jury's as we were made to feel like uninvited party guests.

<Content>Lovely hotel in great location I had booked Jury's as it was the best rated hotel out of a list given to me from Airmiles (needed to use a few miles up). In between booking and travelling Jury's went to number 1 on Tripadvisor...so I was looking forward(even more)to my first trip to Boston. I was not disappointed.The rooms are well furnished, (mine was not large but perfectly adequate for our 3 day stay. I worked out if you turn left from the lift (elevator) then chances are you will have one of the larger rooms, I did see one when the maid was cleaning, if you want one try asking for a twin, instead of a double), and are decorated in relaxing colours. The bathroom had a shower and bath and was well stocked with Aveda products. The staff are extremley polite, friendly and helpful, a warm welcome awaits all guests. As for the facilities, there is a small gym, 2 lounges next to the lobby, a basement bar and restaurant. the bar can be noisy, but that is just because the sound echo's a little, you don't hear it when you are away from the entrance stairs nor does it seem that noisy when you are in it. It is well worth having a beer or two after a long days shopping or pre dinner. Dinner, the one downfall is the restuarant, don't use it even for breakfast. My wife and I did have one meal, we were too tired to start looking for somewhare else, so decided to give it a try. My food was tasteless (monk fish was watery and had no flavour at all, my vegetable starter I knew it was based on tomatoes and mushrooms because that as the shape and colour of the food, but where was the taste? nowhere, probably left in the kitchen.) Breakfast even though we were down early (around 7:30) the buffet breakfast was stale and overcooked. There are many many places to eat go somewhere else. We did not stay at Jury's because of the restaurant so it did not detract from our overall experience. I would highly recommend Jury's, the location is perfect for Boston Common, Beacon Hill, Copley Square and Downtown, all are no more than a 10 min walk. When I go back to Boston, my first choice will be Jury's there is a lovely warm relaxed feel to the place.

<Content>Top notch and classy Stay at the Jurys Boston. It's great.My girlfriend and I stayed there this past weekend when visiting Boston for a romantic getaway of shopping, sightseeing, etc. We were thrilled. She stays at some of the best of the best hotels, the Ritz e.g., all over the country with her big shot job and she thought that the Jurys Boston was the nicest hotel she's stayed at so far.While planning the getaway, I got to know Jurys Boston's friendly and courteous staff while I made arrangements for our big weekend. They were always the most helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. We stayed in an Executive Corner King on the 6th Floor--Room 638 to be exact. We were met at the door by the valet who promptly help us unload and took care of the car. The Valet and garage fee was an extra $36, which is competitive for Boston parking. We went through the impressive lobby and had our room keys in less than five minutes. We entered our room and I immediately noticed that it was filled with welcoming light from three large windows. Also, I noticed that the vase of long stem roses I had arranged with the concierge the night before was waiting on the table and filling the room with fragrance. The stereo tape/CD player was also set to softly playing classical music.The bathroom was finished completely in natural stone and marble with a walk-in shower and a large spacious bath. There were fluffy white towels and pristine white robes waiting for us. There is also a large closet off the bath with a safe. There was a king size bed that was absolutely clean and perfect, and the room just set the perfect mood for the trip. The true test of a hotel is the bed. So many top hotels have terrible beds that are old and moldy. Not Jurys. I was so impressed with this bed that I wrote down the name of the mattress manufacturer, size and style and I plan to order one of my own. My girlfriend, the world traveller, was equally impressed. She says she usually wakes up from a hotel stay with a backache. The bed was so nice that, unfortunately, we missed a few hours of sightseeing because we just stayed in the bed wrapped up in the hotel bathrobes (I also wrote down the manufacturer's name of the robes). Fortunately, we didn't miss much sightseeing in the end because outside it was freezing outside anyway. You wouldn't know it because this is no drafty old money hotel like others I've been in Boston. It was so warm and cozy in the room that I just assumed that the blue sky meant a gorgeous warm day outside. The insulated windows weren't cold, so how would I have known? Well, at other hotels, I would have known because of cold windowsills, drafts and condensation on the windows. The concierge was also helpful in getting us around. We got breakfast at a place the concierge recommended and it was excellent as well. I've been to many hotels where the concierge really didn't know much about the area at all. A good concierge can make a huge difference in the success of your trip and Jurys's concierge was certainly friendly and reliable.I only wish we'd had time to stay for two or more nights. We didn't even get to eat at the restaurant on the premises or spend much time at Cuff's Irish Pub downstairs. On Saturday night, it was packed! It's clearly a popular place, and well decorated. The waterfall staircase and open fireplaces are elegant. In contrast, the hotel lobby was cozy and inviting. If you need to do work, this is a good lobby. It's not one of those giant echo-filled lobbies where one can get easily distracted. The lobby at the Jurys Boston is again well-lighted, and well furnished with sound-absorbant materials. There were many people this Sunday just sitting on the big comfy sofas reading the complementary Boston Globes. Had I had the time, I certainly would have joined them.In short, we loved the Jurys Boston. Even though I'm curious about staying at other hotels when we come back to Boston, I'll be hard pressed to risk a stay somewhere else that might not measure up.Jurys was the cleanest, friendliest, classiest and highest quality hotel experience I've ever had and I couldn't recommend it more. Lastly, I only picked it because it was rated #1 on this site. I don't know anyone who's stayed there so I went completely based on what people on this site had to say. Nice going TripAdvisor!

<Content>Nice, but could be better... I recently stayed here on business and while the stay was pleasant enough, if I were returning to Boston for pleasure (and on my own dime), I would shop around before returning here. The good: location, appearance, bathroom amenities, comfortable bed.The bad: Housekeeping. Upon first entering the room, the pillows were in a stack in the middle of the bed without cases, as if the housekeeper had simply left in the middle of setting up the room. When I informed the front desk, they promised to send someone up promptly, which they did not. It was only when a woman came for turndown service and noticed the pillows that anything was done. Also, some of the towels had black smudge marks on them.In summary, although the hotel has several nice features, there is no excuse for poor housekeeping especially when hotels that charge half the price manage it just fine.

<Content>Great Hotel! Could not pick a better Hotel!It has character, rooms are beautiful, ask for a high floor. They have one floor for smokers I think it was the 2nd and when the elevator opened it reeked of smoke! Even if you are a smoker the rooms on this floor are not as nice. My husband is a smoker and I made him go outside everytime he wanted to smoke. He didn't mind he got to know the doorman real well. The hotel was in the middle of everything.Do the trolley tour and buy it on-line it was cheaper and you learn alot about the city.A must is the Aquarium. It was GREAT!

<Content>Second stay, just as good Stayed at Jurys for the second time on the weekend follwing Thanksgiving. Upon arrival we were welcomed back (acknowledged for having stayed there once before) and given the same room we had during our last stay.The room is of decent size, was perfectly clean and the bed is very comfortable.Given the consistancy I've experienced and the relatively good value, considering the amenities and location, Jurys is my first choice when staying in Boston.

<Content>Great, Try it ! not pompous ! We stayed in Le Meridien before and it was pompous, not doubt about it . but Jury's is a great location managed by real people. The location, two blocks from the Copley Place Mall is great for shopping, same distance to Boston Common and 10 mins walk to Faneuil Hall and Quincy's Marketplace.Rooms are USA large, as expected. Showers not baths - no problem for us at less than $100 per night. Breakfast at $15.00 for the buffet is a little overpriced, but hey , who eats Hotel breakfasts in Boston when there is Paramount on Charles Street !! which is famous for breakfast.The Concierge had a rental car delivered to the foyer for us with less than 24 hours notice, the cleaner loves cleaning the lounge of this hotel as it is her pride and joy  How often do you hear this. the Bar has a line up on weekends because the atmosphere is so good. Yet, it is one of the quietest hotels in a city we have ever stayed in. One comment, the minibar is not stocked, but they have 24/7 Room Service - so no need I agree. The beds are amazing, the toiletries are Aveda. So ignore the last UK rating. Dont be ripped off by the more expensive options, stay at Jury's . They do what they say on the label, and don't make a big issue or try to be what they ain't !

<Content>Third stay - losing some ground Third stay here, and hotel is beginning to show some wear. The first room we were taken to, the carpet was quite stained, and the room was very small for a Delux rate. The second room had some housekeeping problems (soil under the bathroom sink).Forget about using the bar on the weekend unless you are 25-35 years old and don't mind standing, shouting and not getting anywhere near the bar. Suggestion - they should open the coffee bar at night for drinks, or use the large living room as a relaxing cocktail lounge. The service in the restaurant at night is wonderful, and the breakfast service is still very slow and sometimes breakfast never comes.I believe that next family visit, I amy try another hotel.

<Content>The Jury's In and the Verdict Is Great! After a recent stay at Jurys Boston, I can safely say that it was excellent! The only two drawbacks I found were 1. No hooks in the bathroom near to the shower (the shower was huge with ample hot water and good water pressure); 2. The afforementioned glitter panels in the elevators (a bit rough to deal with after a few pints in the pub).Parking was a bit of a shock - It really was $36.00 per day - we spent nearly as much for dinner!But, by and large the room was very comfortable and nicely decorated with soothing taupes and greens, and humongous bed pillows.The full Irish Breakfast was (according to my spouse) as good as one had in Ireland!

<Content>Great hotel Great hotel in many ways. The staff are all terrific. Room service is excellent. Rooms are beautiful and clean. But please ask for a quiet room if possible-mine was on the second floor (212) just above a loading dock that got noisy at 4 am. An inner room would be much better.

The hotel rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff all very friendly and helpful. The lounge areas and Cuffs bar are very welcoming with a relaxed atmosphere and the whole hotel is immaculatelypresented. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again when we return to Boston.

<Content>Great place to stay in Boston Stayed here with friends for 3 nights and had a blast. The rate was a little steep, but if you book early enough you can get good deals. The location is excellent, and the bar and club in the restaurant are nice perks. We couldn't have asked for a nicer or cleaner room, including the bathroom. The service was always helpful. If you're in Boston for the first time, I'd highly recommend this hotel as it provides the full tourist experience. I'd also recommend it for couples or those of us under 40 years of age. Don't pay too much, but don't hesitate to book if the price is competitive with everything else in the area.

<Content>Worst Hotel Experience ever This hotel is the most poorly run business I have ever encountered. I booked the trip online - prepaid. A week after leaving they charged my checking acount $653.45 for the cost of the room. Not only did they make this ridiculous mistake but they were completely incompetent at correcting it. Thanks to this establishment I could not pay my bills and was bouncing checks. I have contacted them 6 times and even though they admit it is thier mistake, I have yet to see a penny. I would rather stay in a motel 6 than go through this experience.

<Content>dirty bathroom The Jurys of Boston has a great location and the beds are very comfortable. The bathroom is very pretty with a nice big shower; however, our bathroom was not clean. The floor had not been mopped and I don't think the shower had been cleaned. When I called about the dirty bathroom they did send someone immediately to clean it and were apologetic. The breakfast downstairs in their restaurant is very good. Overall we had a nice stay.

<Content>Does everything well Having just spent five nights at Jurys it's difficult to find fault.The hotel's position is great and it's an easy stroll to many of Boston's attractions. If you need to go a bit further afield, two T stations are on your doorstep.My room was a standard twin but was a good size with all the amenities you'd need, including a big walk-in shower. Bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet. There were no problems with cleanliness, as other reviewers have mentioned.At first sight I wasn't that impressed with the bar, bearing in mind it's one of Boston's 'in' places right now. But once it starts filling up it's a lively place to mix with the locals and enjoy good drinks, service and food. The hotel's restaurant is decent enough but trying to be a bit more upscale than it is. Better to spend that kind of money in the many other really good restaurants on your doorstep.My final word's reserved for the staff, who were great throughout. Really friendly and Keith the concierge is particularly helpful.

<Content>Comfortable, Cozy, Lovely Service Just returned from a two night- mid week get away to Boston. First time staying at Jury's and I chose it based on Trip Advisor reviews. Although a bit pricey - Service was wonderful, they couldn't have done more! We are newspaper addicts and they not only leave the Boston Globe at your door but were happy to send along the New York Times as well. Room was small but quite cozy, bed was heavenly, bathroom lovely. Appreciated the windows that opened and the towel warmers and bathrobes. Although the bar is amazingly loud when you come through the front doors the rooms were quiet as could be! Didn't eat at the restaurant, but then there are so many wonderful restaurants in the area.I would go again, great location!

<Content>pleasant weekend at Jurys We enjoyed our stay at the Jurys last weekend. The rooms are small, but very nice. The bed is super-comfy. We were traveling with our one year old daughter, something I would not really recommend since the rooms are so small and the common areas less than kid-friendly. While the decor of the hotel is very nice, in my opinion the random details that I assume are meant to be hip look out of place and just weird. For example, the glittery stuff on the back wall of the elevator -- what's up with that? Also, the stairs from the bar to the front desk area that change color every few minutes are just ugly. I guess these are a continuation of the happening bar downstairs that adjoin them. We very much enjoyed the food we had from the hotel -- a delicious room service breakfast and a lunch in the bar was tasty, too. I did find it odd that the bar was the only place for lunch, though. Being the trendy place that it is, it wasn't really a cozy place for lunch on a wet Saturday, particularly with a kid in tow. Also, I searched high and low for a cup of tea on Sat. afternoon (it is an Irish hotel after all!) and was told the bar, again, was the only option. The staff was very friendly. We received a great breakfast recommendation -- Charlie's, a Mom and Pop greasy spoon diner with very good food in the South End, about a 10 minute walk away. Highly recommended!

<Content>Irish hospitality ! Great location, wonderful service, comfortable rooms, large bathrooms ... I could go on. Irish hospitality in a trendsetting hotel with a happening scene at the bar (Cuffs). If you appreciate good design and friendly service(not always found together in hip hotels) Jurys is for you. My only criticism - the gym could be larger, although it was functional. We'll be back.

<Content>Just okay Very nice hotel, but a little stuffy. We stayed at Jury's the second weekend that we were in Boston at the end of September. We were expecting a nice Irish hotel and it was nice, but probably not worth the money. The first weekend we stayed at the Millennium Hotel near Faneuil Hall and we ended up moving from Jury's to the Millennium our last night in Boston.

<Content>100% Terrific My wife and I stayed here Oct 1,2,  3 and were very pleased. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready so we went downstairs to the pub, Cuff's, and had lunch while watching the Sox game on the 2 plasma screens behind the bar. After lunch our room was ready and the staff put our bags in the room while we went barhopping and sight-seeing. The room was great and very quiet. Nice linens and tasteful furniture. Not a great view, but I wasn't expecting one. Well done bathroom with Kohler fixtures and a Toto commode. Good showerhead with good pressure. The maid service was impeccable. Free newspaper at your door every morning.The concierge set us up with a great Sunday brunch at Abe  Louie's near Copley Plaza. We ordered room service on Monday night at around midnight and the service and food were both just fine. Location-wise, this place is great. It's less than a five minute walk to either the Orange or Green Line. Five minutes walking to the Public Garden or Copley Square. I walked the whole Freedom Trail from the hotel. There's no need for a cab virtually anywhere in Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Financial District, or Chinatown (unless you're just pressed for time, lazy, or the weather's bad). Inside the decor is fairly modern with a luminescent staircase in the lobby that changes colors. I have a friend who has a bunch of Fairmont points who I met up with over at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. My wife stays there for work on occasion as well as Jury's is not on her corporate list. The Fairmont is like the place your rich parents or grandparents would stay. It's really probably on average about $50 a night more, I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything except for a very nice building architecturally. I'd love to go back to Jury's again soon.

<Content>Close the Bar! Just stayed for the second time. The Jury is in a great location, close to Back Bay, Commonwealth Ave and shopping. The standard room is very nice, but small. Would feel very cramped with two people if staying more than a couple of days. There isn't room for a good reading chair. Bathrooms are nice with a walk-in shower - a real plus. Hotel restaurant was very good with excellent service. Main lobby bar is very comfortable and elegant. Concierge and desk people were excellent.The big problem with Jury is that the downstairs bar is clearly a favorite of the 25-35 year old investment banker/hedge fund crowd out to flash money, sip martinis and impress their followers. Very, very loud and the sound extends into the restaurant and upstairs main lobby bar. Late on a Friday night there was a line to get in out on the sidewalk. Not what you want at your hotel. Hopefully they'll move on when something hotter opens!

<Content>Disappointed! I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights based purely on reviews on this website. Whilst the location was excelellent and the staff were very friendly I found the standard of cleanliness in the rooms below par. For a hotel which has only been open little over a year I was disapointed to note the carpet and bedcover were badly stained amd the armoir extremely dusty. It was so bad in fact we requested a room change. The staff at the front desk could not have been more apologetic and did move us to another room with a better view however although this was an improvement it still fell way below the standards I would expect from a 4 star hotel. The rooms are extremely attractive as are the public areas however stained carpets etc. are exremely offputting and I don't know if I would consider Jurys again if I was to return to Boston.I noted another guest wrote a review on this website in a similar vein so obviously we weren't just unlucky!!

<Content>Just so, so My husband and I stayed at the Jurys Boston for 3 nights in Sept 05. The hotel is in an incredible location. It is very close to all attractions. However, the customer service was not up to par for what I think is a 4 or 5 star hotel. The room was very small, and over decorated which made it seem even smaller. The bed took up most of the room and every other piece of furniture seemed to be cramped in. The room did have some good aspects. Free bottled water was a first in any hotel I have stayed in. The oversized towels, bath robes and Aveda products were very comforting. Would I stay at this hotel again? Maybe if it was less than $200 a night, but at the rate we stayed, we would find somewhere a little cheaper, with larger rooms.

<Content>Treated Like Royalty We were treated like royalty! This is quite possibly the finest hotel I鈥檝e ever experienced. Our 鈥渞oyal treatment鈥?started before we even arrived. The day before our visit, I realized I had forgotten exactly where we had made our reservations, and called Jury鈥檚 as I remembered that they were one of the hotels that came most highly recommended by trip advisor reviews. Our recollection was that they had been booked for the dates we needed and had recommended another boutique hotel in the area. I spoke with a gentleman named Dan, who I later learned was the Deputy General Manager. To my great surprise, he offered to call around to other hotels on my behalf to find out where we had our reservation. Clearly, there was no benefit to him to provide this service, as he believed we were not staying at his hotel. After spending an hour calling around to other hotels, he called to inform me that we were actually booked at Jury鈥檚. We both had a well-deserved laugh.Once we arrived, the royal treatment continued. The hotel is absolutely lovely and extremely hip. Carefully selected paintings and sculptures abound. There is a fashionable lobby with a bar on the lobby level, and a 鈥榟appening鈥?bar and restaurant downstairs. The rooms are wonderful with great attention to detail, including warming racks for the towels鈥nd the beds are oh so comfortable. Most impressive was the extraordinary level of customer service they provided. Everyone, including the doormen, the reception staff, the concierge and waiters were fabulous. We got the feeling that they really couldn鈥檛 do enough for us. Of special note were Keith, the concierge, Kevin, our charming Irish waiter and of course Dan the Deputy General Manager (who also had a gift tray sent to our room when we arrived). We enjoyed our stay so much that, even though we were supposed to transfer to the Four Seasons for the last two nights of our stay, we cancelled that reservation in order to stay at Jury鈥檚. Obviously we can鈥檛 recommend this hotel enough and it will certainly be our choice when we visit again. Thanks to all of the staff for making our visit to Boston so perfect.

<Content>Jury's - Great Place Our family and another family vacationed in Boston in August. Main reason for the trip was to visit the Hallowed Grounds of Fenway. First tirp to Boston for either family so we weren't exactly sure where to stay (wanted to be close to fenway), we were debating between Jury's and Buckminster (which is 1 bolock from Fenway). Decided to go to Jury's and we decided it was one of the best choices we have ever made. Comparing the two is like comparing a weekend at Club Med vs. an emergency stay in the hospital for a couple of days. Jury's is an easy walk to Fenway (we walked it twice) as well as Boston Commons  historical sites on the freedom trail and others. Jury's staff was very helpful and friendly, hotel very clean. Yea Cuff's is very busy and noisy at night but we enjoyed the a drink up in the lobby bar. Loved the city and will definately stay here again.

<Author>mommy2boys
<Content>Maybe we were just unlucky??!! Ok, so maybe we were just unlucky when we stayed here for 2 nights over labor day weekend?? My husband and I were staying without the kiddies for the weekend, because we were heading up to Lahey Clinic on Tuesday and decided to have a couple nights to ourselves. So, after reading the reviews for Jurys and Nine Zero we picked Jurys. I guess I wish that we had tried the Nine Zero.Our first room was on the 10th floor, one of only 3 rooms, so it would be quiet, which was great. However, the bedspread and pillows had numerous stains on them, the toilet in the bathroom had the seat unattached, and the TV did not work right. The volume on the TV is capped, which is not a problem, but it is when one speaker out of two total speakers is not working. No problem, we called down to see if we could move, as we were planning on catching up on our movies via PayPerView while we were away.We were relocated to a room on the 5th floor. It was not noisy and was a pretty good size. The pros and cons of the hotel are as follows:PROS:1) Good location.2) Nice Aveda Products in the bathroom3) Fabulous dual head shower and towel warmer!!4) Nice and accomodating staff, really superb.5) GREAT breakfast room service, try the blueberry pancakes.6) Refridgerator in room that is empty so you can stock it.CONS:1) Very expensive room service, as expected, but atrocious dinner food.2) No stores to buy snacks or sodas within close walking distance.3) Room not the cleanest...dust on furniture, stains on carpets.All in all, not bad, but for $250+ a night, I would expect the hotel to be in a little better condition. Little things that were annoying were we only had one bathrobe, the warm cookies from room service were good, but not warm, parking was $36 a DAY, not easy in/out either - a good 15 to 20 minute wait each time. All the other reviews were very positive so maybe it was just us. However, this is what happened during our stay. I probably would not stay here again, would opt for the other hotels in the area.

<Content>Great value and service Just returned from visit number 3 at Jurys, and already planning return. What clinched it for me since I go to Boston often on business, is the free broadband and the quality of the bedrooms. Beds are almost Westin-like for comfort, bathrooms with Aveda toiletries, which as a woman, I really like and actually do take home. My employers are cheap skates, but I have demonstrated to them that the nearby Park Plaza and other dives are a false economy compared to the goodies on offer at Jurys that happily have me working longer hours. Room service pleasant and prompt, but food fairly indifferent.

<Content>Loved Jurys! One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. My husband  I stayed there Aug 27 - Sept 1 for our anniversary. Everything is top-notch. The doormen, front desk staff  concierge were all so friendly and helpful. Our room was kept perfectly and stocked with Aveda products and had towel warming bars. The restaurant/bar downstairs is a popular spot. It's in a central location (near Boston Commons), walking distance to many sights  close to the T. Highly recommend this hotel, we will definitely be back on our next trip to Boston.

The beds were phenomenal. Be careful of parking on the street boston police like to fill their quotas....maybe a new york license plate?? Gym was tiny but clean and new. Nobody else seemed to use it. Would stay here again.

<Content>Great value!! Stayed at the Jurys Boston for one night after a long flight from Seattle. Had a really good rate and was very pleased with the whole hotel. I am used to staying in luxury hotels and my experience here was great. Great bathroom with beautiful walk in shower and aveda bath products - plus a mirror that doesn't fog up!The room was small but that wasn't a problem. Free internet, nice flat screen tv, radio, and complimentary water - all in all very good ammenities.The bar Cuffs is very popular and loud at night - there is a line to get in but if you are staying at the hotel, you do not have to wait - worth checking out.I have stayed at other hotels in Boston and this is by far my favorite!

<Content>A Great Hotel I spent three nights at the hotel during my first trip to Boston.The location is wonderful - near the Back Bay subway station. Walking distance to Newbury Street, Prudential Centre, Copley Mall....I stayed in a Superior room. Kingsize bed, large bathroom with a fullsize tub. Nicely decorated. I wasn't facing the street, so it was very quiet.The room had a mini-fridge, so on my first night I took a walk down to Shaw's supermarket and bought some juice, fruits and veggies to keep in it. It's a nice little touch. There is Dasani water stocked in the fridge as well, at no charge.The bed was quite possibly the most comfortable one I have ever slept in...the pillows are phenomenal.The hotel has a turn down service and each evening, I came home to some chocolates, an inspirational card, and soft music playing on the mini-cd/radio.The staff was friendly and check in/out was quick and painless. There was no problem leaving bags in storage until I needed to leave for the airport in the evening.There are two computers with internet access in the business area, but there is no time limit on use, so a few times I got stuck waiting a long time to check my e-mail. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Attention to detail and oustanding service This hotel is a visual treat. Rich colours, sophisticated artwork in the common areas, a charming room...it all adds up to a great environment. And then there's the service. The doorman on duty when we arrived (Michael) was so pleasant and terrific; Ireland's beautiful Martina on the desk, who called me on my cell phone to let us know when our room was ready (we arrived at 7:00 am, and were in our room at 10:30); our waiter in Cuffs (Joey from Dublin) who was so engaging and pleasant; and our countryman Jean from Montreal who treated us like we were family (thanks for the Sam Adams, Jean!) all contributed to a very personal and special vacation.I've stayed in some fine hotels in North America and abroad. Jurys is my new number one.

<Content>Very pleasant stay We booked a double room for four nights in mid-August based on the recommendations of this site - and are very pleased that we did!The lobby area and adjacent bar were very welcoming and the staff were courteous and efficient. The room was impeccably decorated / furnished, well provisioned and very clean with a large comfortable bed. Room service was very good with a reasonable choice of food and beverages at acceptable prices. We did not use the hotel restaurant or bar during our stay and, therefore, unable to offer comment. However, there are several good eating establishments close to the hotel including the Hard Rock cafe, plus there are two Starbucks close by.The concierge was extremely helpful in securing a hire car for two days at very favourable rates, although parking in Boston is difficult to find and very expensive. Be advised, if you intend to drive in Boston plan your route in advance, if you do not know this city reasonably well you can go horribly wrong in the one way system and constant roadworks.The hotel is centrally located and adjacent to local transportation services, although a number of attractions are within walking distance.Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and would endorse the recommendations of this site.

<Content>Friendly faces guaranteed! We had never been to Boston before our trip from Aug 25 to Aug 30. So glad we picked the Jury's for our stay - it gave us reassurance as soon as we stepped through the door that this was going to be a fantastic stay.The beds are.... words cannot describe the opulence and comfort. The staff are just wonderful, they would break their backs for you and the location is top, you are just a few minutes walk from Newbury street (I recommend The Closet...Jimmy Choos for $110!) and about a 30-minute stroll to Downtown crossing.I just cannot find fault with this place and I would challenge anyone to pick holes in the fine location, services and staff relations. This is by far THE best hotel I have ever stayed in, in the US. So people, book up and enjoy. What's to lose?

<Content>Welcome Home Ladies!! From the moment we pulled up to the door we were greeted by the doorman stating Welcome Home, Ladies. What a wonderful place to stay. A great location, extremely nice and pleasant people to deal with. We did have some issues such as cigarette smoke smell in our non-smoking room on the 3rd floor which is directly above the 2nd floor smoking floor. Our TV only went up to a volume of 12 and was difficult to hear. We notified the desk and were promptly moved to the 7th floor and enjoyed our stay with no other glitches. We had ordered cookies one night and had some of the best, freshest and warmest chocolate chip cookies. Because we had to wait a little long for the cookies we even got glasses of milk to enjoy with our cookies free of charge! It always made us smile and feel very welcome every time the doorman opened our car door and greeted us with Welcome Home, Ladies.

<Content>Great Hotel, Small Beds My family and I stayed at the Jurys August 3 through 10 and had a lovely experience. Every staff member we encountered was helpful and professional. I only had two complaints about our stay. One is the beds. While they are extremely comfortable, they are also very small. We had two doubles since we had our two kids with us. I'm sure the king beds are a dream! Also there was construction going on across the street into the wee hours. This of course had nothing to do with the Jurys, and we tried to ignore it. Overall a pleasant stay.

<Content>issues resolved at Jurys We had an issue during our stay at this great hotel which was not of their making. we were woken at 2am by a construction team apparently repairing undergound pipework in the street opposite, the crew consisted of about 10 with a mechanical digger and heavy drill equipemt. In the early hours it sounded like down town baghdad and it is amazing that Bostonians are prepared to put up with this sort of thing, in the UK we have laws against noise pollution after 11pm. We called reception and asked to be moved but they were full that evening ( v popular hotel) but promised a change of room the for the following night. they were polite, even apologetic, even though the issue was not their fault. they moved us to a bigger room facing the back of the hotel the following evening and charged us the same price as a standard, which imo is great customer service. All the reviews on here are correct, it is a pristine hotel with wonderful staff in a brilliant location. the bar is also worth a visit although there are so many great bars and restaurants in walking distance do take the time to explore. In particular a restaurant just a couple of blocks away called the Mistral has fantastic food and service, highly recommended.

<Content>The Jury's not out! We stayed at Jury's for four nights at the beginning of our New England trip and can only say that we were very much looking forward to the day we returned before departing to the airport. Lovely rooms with huge beds, fluffy white robes, Aveda toiletries...heaven! Although a small hotel in comparison with some in Boston, Jury's was friendly with good food in the restaurants and very well placed for a walk anywhere - just two blocks from the Boyston Street shops and the parks and two blocks in the opposite direction to the Copley and Prudential Malls the Prudential Tower and many good restaurants. The concierge was extremely helpful, booking tickets for us whenever needed and giving helpful advice on restaurants.We will definitely be going back here on a return visit to Boston.

Jurys Boston was a wonderful place to stay. The service was outstanding. The food at the restaurant was sensational. The conciergewas extremely helpful. Cannot wait to go back and stay at Jurys Boston.

<Content>Great Hotel I can't imagine staying at a better hotel in Boston. The service was impeccable. The rooms were uniquely and elegantly designed. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. My fiance' refused to get out of it on the last day. The location is perfect (right near the Hancock Bldg.). True that the bar gets very crowded and loud at night, but the minute you step into the elevator the noise is gone. The only negative is that parking is $36 / night. However, in the heart of Beantown that is not surprising.

<Content>Nicest Hotel we have ever stayed in! All I can say is Wow, what a nice Hotel. Everything from the room, the staff, etc. was impeccable. The shower was the greatest! (The water actually stayed in the shower, unlike most hotels!) Even though we were right downtown the room was quiet. My wife said the bed was the most comfortable she has ever slept on. When can we stay here again? I can't wait!

<Content>What a great pleasure! Stayed at the Jurys Boston this past weekend 8/28 to 8/31. Found this hotel on this website - what a pleasant surprise this jewel is. Probably the best service and the most professional staff I have encountered in a long time. Surprised to find the bar currently the hot spot of the Back Bay,even the staff has no explaination for it! Room was very comfortable, loved the large bathroom with tiled walk in shower. Location was convient and quiet during the evening hours, felt very safe walking around. Richard at the concierge desk has a great sense of humor and gives 110% to his job.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location This is an excellent hotel located beside John Hancock Tower. This former Boston Police Headquarters was opened in June '04 and the staff are amongst the most pleasant you will find in any American property. Rooms are an adequate size and very well designed with in room safe and ironing facilities. Bathrooms are modern and of a great standard. All rooms offer free WiFi facilities.The bar on the ground floor is excellent, altho can be quite crowded at night as it has an outside patio area for the smokers!!!.Overall, one of the nicest, happiest hotels you're likely to experience in North America with staff that really make you feel at home.

<Content>Great Hotel, great value! We were very pleasantly surprised by our stay at Jurys - the staff was wonderful (thanks, Richard!), and the rooms, although a little small, were quite elegant. We thought the location was top notch.It does get a little noisy at night with the downstairs bar/restaurant, but if you are looking for a lively place for a drink before settling in, it's great.Would definitely recommend and would stay here again!

<Content>First visit to USA will definitely be back Visited Boston on 5th June and this was our first trip to the States. Encouraged by the reviews of Jurys on your website I booked our eight night stay there. We had an excellent time in Boston and managed to see all the main sights either on foot or by using the excellent public transport system. Jurys was well placed for the station around the corner at Back Bay and we managed visits to Rockport and Salem on the commuter trains.The hotel staff were all very friendly and the room quiet and comfortable. The people of Boston were very helpful - whenever we stopped to consult our town map someone would usually come up to us and ask if we needed any guidance. We have travelled extensively in Europe over the years but we will definitely be back to Boston next year and look forward to staying at Jurys again.

<Content>Love the Irish Accents! Everyone was so friendly at this hotel, even though it was July 4th weekend in Boston and hectic. Our room was the standard room, a bit small, so next time I will reserve a larger one, but the amenities were bountiful..Aveda products, heated towel racks, comfortable bed, and a great bar. The only thing I would recommend would be a coffee maker in the room. I had a hard time wanting to leave my room in search of coffee after a night out in the town.

<Content>Exceeds Expectations The Jury's in Boston is a great hotel. The rooms are clean and modern, yet manage to keep a historical presence in the old Police building in which they are located. The staff is exemplary and the concierge Richard Owen was a great host to the hotel as well as the city of Boston, giving directions and suggestions, which proved very helpful. The restaurants and bars in house a great, but the Jury's is also within walking distance to most of the city. It was the perfect place to stay in Boston and will definitely be staying there again!

<Content>Great Hotel  Really first-class Hotel with pleasant, polite and helpful staff. Very well maintained and immaculate rooms with great beds and very good bathrooms. We had a 'superior room' which was exactly that - first-class in every respect. Has its own bar, cocktail lounge and restaurant. Would definitely reccomend it  will stay here again next time in Boston.

<Content>Fantastic hotel - highly recommend My partner and I stayed at the jurys hotel Boston In may this year - we got a good deal by taking them up on their 'beat any proce deal' as Orbitz were offering a room cheaper than the main Jurys site and so they kindly matchedthe price!The room was huge - by british standards! the beds and pillows were unbelivevably comfy and the bathroom was nice clean and large. the restraunt was quite upmarket and a bit beyond our budget but they also serve food at their irish bar which is well worth the value for money. but be warned taht the irish bar is a hot spot for tourists and local on weekends so Friday and saturday nightas it is rammed! The staff are very kind, attentve and make you feel very welcome.I would definately stay here again- The only fault I could find was that tea and coffee facilities didn't come with the room and thats a standard thing for most british hotels and was shocked to see that if you wanted any tea making facilities they charged you- but that really wasthe only fault!

<Content>Great Hotel We have just come back from a weekend stay in Jurys and we were not disappointed.We arrived early and our room was not ready, so rather that leaving us waiting the receptionist gave us an upgrade. Lovely touch. The room was lovely, decor modern and unfussy , bed was huge and very very comfortable. I know it is a cliche but I loved the turn down service.The staff were very very friendly. From the concierge to the bell boy, they could not have been more helpful answering all our questions and providing us with loads of suggestions of how to spend the weekend.Free internet acess in the business center was an additional bonus.

<Content>Incredible... My wife and I went to Boston for our 1st wedding anniversary and the Jury's hotel was one of the many highlights of our trip. The employees were very attentive, after our room service the front desk called to make sure it was alright. Walking distance to many shops, parks, and other bars if Cuffs gets to crowded. We are going to stay here again when we return to Boston.

<Content>Jurys a good choice I thought this was a great hotel! Our room was very spacious, comfortable and attractive. The bathroom is huge and the Aveda products a nice touch. We stayed in the deluxe double room, so maybe the standard doubles are a bit smaller. I was worried about noise because we were located right next to the elevator, but it was not noisy at all. The staff was helpful and the location was good for walking around the city. The downstairs bar was crowded, but it looked like everyone was having a great time, and if you wanted a quieter space, you could sit in the lobby bar. I was very happy with this hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Loved the Jury's Thanks Tripadvisor, the Jury's has another satisfied customer due to the postings here. We were not disatisfied with our choice.........  this from former Boston residents. The hotel is centrally located (halfway between the Copley  Arlington T stops, walking distance to Copley, Pru Center, Boston Commons, Newberry Street Shops, Boylston Theater district  the Starbucks or Au Bon Pain that we frequented when we did not want the delicious but pricey hotel restaurant for breakfast).The rooms and all appointments are new and the whole hotel is tastefully decorated. Staff was helpful and courteous.We went for 2 rooms for our family with 3 kids and we had 2 rooms at the end of a hall across from each other. The plus for us ( I'm sure our neighbors) was that there was an additional door that cordoned off our end of the hallway which made our space more like a suite. I noticed that each floor had 2 sets of these so it's worth requesting for a family. It was sure a plus!Our rates were quite reasonable for a downtown city hotel too.I'm sold on this chain of boutique hotels. I hope they'll bring more to the States from Ireland.

<Content>Superb We travelled to Boston to see U2 in concert in May 2005, and we decided to stay at Jury's to fit with our Irish theme. We got an excellent rate ($139/night) on the hotel's website which we felt was outstanding for a hotel of this superior quality in this location (Back Bay). Speaking of location, the hotel is within a few minutes walking distance to the shopping districts of Boylston St. and Newbury St, and about a 15-20 minute brisk walk to Boston Common, Quincy Market, and the downtown area.The room was quite nice with fabulous amenities, including fine bed linens and Aveda bath products. This is definately a 4+ star hotel, and it certainly deserves all of the great reviews on tripadvisor.comI would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Jurys was excellent After looking at the reviews of Jurys on this site I decided to book here, and was not disappointed. I was in a party of six and we all loved the hotel. Its in an excellent location and is a lovely hotel. From the minute we arrived 'till the end of our stay every single member of staff went out of their way to look after us. The hotel was immaculate, the bedrooms were lovely and the actual beds were out of this world! The restaurant (the Stanhope Grill) was nice and did a lovely breakfast. The bar downstairs Cuffs was great, a nice place to sit and have a well earned drink after a day of sight-seeing. It got pretty busy in the evening with the locals so it was also a great place to just sit and people-watch. We all loved eveything about Jurys and none of us can find one single fault with anything. i highly, highly recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Perfect for our wedding night... After researching Boston hotels on Trip Advisor, we decided to stay here on our wedding night on Memorial Day weekend. It was fantastic! They had upgraded us to a corner room. When we walked in, there was a plate of chocolate-covered strawberries and gourmet chocolates laid out for us, along with a bottle of champagne. The decor is modern, tasteful and warm. No tacky prints on the walls-- interesting artwork. The bathroom was great and stocked with Aveda products. Very nice touch! Beds are very comfortable.We ordered room service in the morning and the people were unbelievably friendly and prompt. The service here was great all around. I'll only mention a couple of things-- first, the bar that greets you when entering the hotel does detract from a relaxed atmosphere (although you leave it all behind when up in your room) and the valet parking is expensive, although not unusual for Boston-- just something to keep in mind when budgeting for your stay. I think it was $36 for one night. All in all, if we didn't live five miles away, we would definitely stay here again. The special feeling of our wedding day was enhanced by our night at Jurys. I highly recommend it!!!

<Content>Jurys- The jury is in- it is a winner with a couple of dissenting votes! We loved the location, the rooms were very comfortable and well appointed. The coffee bar in the morning and as wine bar at night were real plusses. The concierge staff and front desk staff were very helpful. On a dissenting note - took 3 days to get extra hangers from housekeeping. The lobby entrance, glass staircase etc are not welcoming as you arrive to a huge din of people in a very crowded bar- some nights they were lined up on the street to get in. The restaurant is pleasant, serves good food but suffers from almost being unable to get to given the crush of people at the bar.

<Content>Great Hotel, good location Jury's exceeded our expectations from the time of our arrival to our final farewells. We arrived in Boston at 9:00 am and fully expected to check into the hotel but have to wait until noon or later to actually get into our room. Not so at Jury's! The receptionist had a room ready for occupancy and called for the bellhop. Within a matter of minutes, we were handed our door cards and led to the elevator for the beginning of our weekend. Once we entered our room, we were once again pleasantly surprised by the relaxing contemporary decor, absurdly plush bed (which I will get to in a moment), and huge bathroom with a full size walk-in shower! The shower has double shower heads for those hard to reach places. Shortly after, the bellhop delivered our luggage, gave us a tour of the room and all of the amenities in it. Explained the layout of the hotel and suggested that if we needed any further service to call the front desk and ask for Keith. I know that this is probably more of the routine learned at the initial training but his demeanor and pleasant smile made me feel like this was going to be a wonderful weekend.Once we were situated in the room, I took a minute to relax and test out the 'absurdly plush bed' I spoke of earlier. Let me give you a brief description of what that means. The bed was a standard king, long in width and short in length. The bed was covered with 2 decorative pillows, 4 rather large feather down pillows, an overstuffed comforter and underneath that was a feather down blanket. The mattress was pillow top and very, very thick. All in all, the assembled bed reminded me more of a colorful cloud than an actual bed. Needless to say, I had the best rest in a very long time in that bed.The only drawback is that the room was a little small. But you should expect that if you are going to stay in a hotel that was renovated from a very old police station. In the end, it really doesn't matter that much. Who goes on a trip to relax in a room?Lastly, after exiting the hotel, we come to location. With all of the outstanding things listed above about Jury's, there is the issue of location that keeps me from rating it a 5. The location isn't bad at all, in fact it is in the charming South End. You are only minutes from Copley Square and Newbury Street (SHOPPING!) or Boston Common for a relaxing day in the park. Unfortunately, it is located a good 20 minute or more walk from the famed Faneuil Hall and Hanover Street in the North End. You will probably use some type of vehicular transportation for the more famous sites like Fenway Park, Harvard, and Boston Harbor. Although that could be said for about any hotel in the central area. Depending on where you stay determines where you can walk to and where you will have to ride to.One last note more for Jury's than anything. You should change the 3-D holographic design in your elevators. It's so big and so out of place with the rest of the European design.

<Content>The Jury is in Loved this hotel. I brought a group here and we could not have been treated better. From Colin in reservations to the entire front desk staff we were treated wonderfully. Great room with lots of the little amenities that most hotels overlook. The bar was first rate again with great service. Let me emphasize SERVICE, they do it right. I could go on and on but let me just say, do not overlook this gem in the Back Bay.

<Content>Absolutely loved this hotel! We recently stayed at Jurys on a trip to Boston and I was absolutely blown away by the experience. The hotel is perfectly located, close to both Copley Square/Prudential as well as the Boston Common area. The hotel rooms are luxurious, from the beds to the televisions, and of course the amazing bathrooms. There are plenty of places nearby if you feel like going out, but if you feel like staying in, the in-house bar is a really fun place to just hang out. The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful, we got excellent advice on public transportation, places to eat, and sights to see.Overall I would say this is one of the absolute best hotels I have ever stayed in. We are definitely sold and are Jurys customers for life!

<Content>Not a real 4-star hotel (yet) At first, the hotel seems to be a one of high standards and quality. However, staying there brought to light some matters and lack of finesse that you would not expect to find in a hotel that charges as much as it does.鈥?A faulty water feature that made the main fancy staircase tricky to walk on 鈥?Room doors that cannot be closed without being noisy and most people seemed to end up slamming theirs, at all hours 鈥?Hair left in shower from previous occupant (and which was not cleaned after being reported and after the housekeeper had completed her round) 鈥?No soap 鈥?Beds are overly sumptuous, too soft and too high 鈥?The bedding and unnecessary accoutrements are too fussy and the pillows too soft (no choice is offered) 鈥?Rooms are quite warm if the window is closed and a/c not used (a/c is noisy to sleep with) 鈥?Toilet pans give splashback to men and plastic seats move around 鈥?Toilet paper is fragile/flaky and breaks up in your hand 鈥?No towel hooks where they are needed, near the shower 鈥?No trouser press even though there is plenty of room for one 鈥?No clothes caddy 鈥?Missing hair dryer 鈥?Few power sockets, some not where needed 鈥?No backup umbrellas 鈥?Expensive movies 鈥?Most annoying is the function room in the lower ground area which is not sectioned off from the Entry and Reception area (nor has any doors to it). The result of this incomprehensible design decision is that guests are greeted by a phenomenally loud wave of general cacophony from the 75+ people gathered there each time you leave/enter the hotel from early evening onwards. It was not clear if this room is for guests only or if the hotel hires the room out for private use.Perhaps the above would not become issues in a $40 a-night hotel, but somewhere that charges upwards of $185 per night should not be having any of these problems. Better attention should have been paid to the details that affect guests (such as the ones listed above) and not on niceties such as the entrance statue, mesmerising lift walls, a sand-blasted staircase or a cascading water feature, nice as they all are but add nothing to a guest鈥檚 comfort or benefit. In my view, the hotel should not charge more than $80 a night until the above are all resolved.The hotel can be commended for the following;Good overall design, style and d茅cor 鈥?Room furniture 鈥?Bathroom quality and design 鈥?Knowledgeable and helpful staff (except grumpy concierge) 鈥?Handy location 鈥?Turn down service.

<Content>What a Hotel! In a word - Amazing! A beautifully designed hotel which combines traditional with contemporary. We were greeted by the pleasant Irish staff and escorted to our impressive bedroom. It was like sleeping on a cloud!!!!Bathrooms and accessories are first class with a guest business centre boasting free internet access. Having had a problem with luggage we needed some additional toiletries and housekeeping promptly provided these free of charge.The location is superb and we hope to go back and stay here again within the next year.

<Content>Great place to stay Spent a weekend at the Jury's and found it to be a fabulous hotel especially for the price. The rooms were nice and comfortable, service was also very good, and it is in a convenient location. There weren't any mini bars in the rooms but there was free bottled water. Also no coffee makers however the coffee bar in the lobby was fine for me. The only thing that might bother some people is that the hotel bar is very popular, to the point where we waited three deep at the bar for at least 10 minutes for a drink. So if you don't mind a scene then you should be more than heppy.

<Content>"Welcome Home" After checking reviews of Jurys on this site we decided to book the hotel for our recent trip to Boston (April 1st to 5th).Needless to say we weren't disappointed, Jurys was an absolute delight from start to finish. After the warm Welcome home greeting from Jean at the front door things continued to get better with a free upgrade at check in, there was no waiting in line and within minutes of getting out of the taxi we were settling in our room. The room itself was very well furnished, nice big bed with the most comfortable pillows I've ever had in a hotel. Nice touch to find a couple of bottles of free mineral water in the fridge, no coffee or tea making facilities in the room may annoy some people but we never use them anyway. Bathroom was superb, all marble finish, spotlessly clean with lots of towels and comfy robes, also the Aveda toiletries were a definite touch above the usual standard of hotel freebies.Housekeeping was very efficient and the turn down service was a nice touch too.We used the Cuffs bar on several occasions and found it very friendly and quite lively with a good atmosphere, staff were great and made sure we never went thirsty!We very rarely use hotel restaurants as we prefer to eat out and sample the local culinary scene, but one particular night we were taking a pre-dinner drink in Cuffs and decided due to the weather to stay on and eat in at the Stanhope Grill. The food was superb and well priced too but it was the standard of service that made the evening - never imposing or over the top but you always felt that nothing was too much trouble, once again the staff were top notch. The buffet breakfast too was excellent and at $15 was reasonable, please don't be put off by the mental image of a typical buffet as this was well above the usual standard with fresh cakes and nice pastries to finish off.Another big plus was the location of Jurys with a good spot in Back Bay, the refined shopping and cafes of Newbury Street are about a 5 minute stroll away, turn left out of the door and you have good shopping at Croxley Plaza also just minutes away. To Downtown Crossing and the more mainstream venues of Macys, Fileunes etc it would take approx 20 minutes - in fact there aren't many places that you can't walk to in reasonable time. I would recommend a trip to North End (little Italy) to sample the atmosphere, if you can you must have cappucino with chocolate biscotti at Mikes Pastries on Hanover Street and I defy anybody to leave without buying a box full of goodies!Also the usual draws of the Freedom Trail, Boston Common, Theatre District, Faneuils, Quincys Market etc are well within reach of anybody with reasonable mobility - we never had to use a taxi the whole trip.I think an earlier reviewer made an excellent point about Jurys, something like it being a smaller scale Ritz? Well this just about sums up Jurys, a nice size hotel in an architecturally novel building (the former Boston police headquarters) which avoids the impersonality and anonymity of it's larger contemporaries whilst giving a much warmer, friendly feel that pervades through the whole establishment.All in all Jurys was definitely a Welcome Home from home to us in Boston and will certainly be again for future trips.

<Content>Terrific Staff  Jurys more than lived up to my expectations on my recent weekend trip to Boston! The staff was amazing ALL weekend long and to an individual they were extremely personable and professional. The most difficult part of our weekend was trying to choose where to go for dinner each night, as there are countless places withing short walking or cab-ride distance. Being several block away from the Copley/Pru Malls was also appreciated by some in the party. We will stay here again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great service at Jurys Boston We recently returned from a very enjoyable 5 night stay at Jury's Hotel in Boston. The service was very good, and all staff that we encountered were, without exception superb. The rooms, whilst not that large, were well equipped, very comfortable and quiet. As the hotel opened under a year ago, everything feels clean and new.We ate in both Cuffs Bar (nice atmosphere, but gets very busy on Saturday evening) and The Stanhope Grille (more expensive, but worth it), and would recommend both. If we had to make any criticism, albeit it a small gripe, it would be that the bar in the lounge area was only ocassionally staffed. It was extremely cold during our stay, and it was very welcoming to sit in the lounge, by the fire, on our return from site seeing. It would have been even better if we could have got a coffee, without having to venture into the bar.The hotel is very centrally situated in the Back Bay area which is just minutes walk from Boston Common and the City Centre.

<Content>Jury's relaxed, friendly and fun Just returned from a 5 night stay at Jury's and it more than lived up to the reviews we'd read on Tripadvisor before booking. The location is great for theatres, downtown and nearby shopping on Newbury and Boylston. Even with temperatures at -10degrees we walked everywhere! Concierge, and indeed all of the staff, was very friendly and helpful recommending restaurants and booking tickets. A choice of excellent dining options literally on the doorstep and the hotel's own bar is a lively and popular spot with residents and locals. Room was great, with the most comfortable beds, fluffy robes, CD player and Aveda toiletries giving a luxurious touch - really felt pampered after a hard day shopping! Would definitely return to Jury's on any future visit to Boston.

<Content>Trendy but well-run hotel We stayed at the Jurys over the Presidents Day weekend and had a lovely time. The hotel is well-located in the Back Bay area but within walking distance of the South End and even Beacon Hill. All staff were helpful and friendly, the breakfasts were filling and good value, and the Irish bar was a pleasant place to enjoy a pint. The hotel is modern and feels 'trendy' but without the obnoxious service that often accompanies trendiness. Rooms were average size but nicely laid out and on higher floors have reasonable views of the city. All in all good value and a definite place to return to.

<Content>Loved this hotel! I spent 3 nights at the Jurys over the New Year and I can't wait to go back and stay again! The staff was extremely helpful with tips on what to see and where to eat. The hotel itself was very cool (we all loved the lighted staircase and the beautiful fireplace in the bar) and the room was fantastic. The beds were very comfortable, the stereo came in very handy and the bathroom was fantastic with a heated towel rack and Aveda bath products (we went through a lot of Rosemary Mint shampoo and conditioner). There's also built in shelves for toiletries and what not. Then there's the location... the hotel is only a few blocks from the great shopping on Newbury St. and Back Bay is a great neighborhood. If you're going to Boston, you've got to check out this hotel!

<Content>Very Nice and I like it too!!! I read all the reviews of Jury's and decided that it was a little pricey for a single Mom staying over a night to return her daughter to college however us girls have to have fun! We were lucky it was snowing and the city's parking rules were suspended for the MLKwkend so we parked for free across the street!! Better than 34.00 for parking. The doorman was so nice and sweet helping us in from the blazing snow and hailing us a cab a little later. Check in was quick. The room was very nice and the college student loved the wireless internet. I loved the hot shower and the robe!!! We went to the bar after returning from dinner and the fireplace and the fun crowd were great on a snowy Sunday night. A nice big glass of wine was 6.50 !!! The down bed and linens were divine!!! No street noise and in fact the curtians pulled tight gave off no light or noise, we slept until 10 am. Althought the prior comments about the slamming doors was true, I only noticed at night. The breakfast buffet was fine but a bit pricey @ 15.00 each... we just couldn't eat that much cheaper breakfast can be found. Check out was a breeze!!! Very nice staff and decor. Glad I paid 185.00 over 200.00 I would not be as happy!!! It's the luck o' the Irish!!!!

<Content>Perfect! My boyfriend and I recently went on our first trip to Boston and choose Jury's because we knew of their excellent reputation in Ireland. We couldn't have been happier with our choice. Our room was beautiful, and very tastfully decorated. The bed was so cozy . . . everything down. The bathroom was huge and felt spa-like. Overall, it was homey and didn't make you feel like you were in some boring chain hotel. Also the bar downstairs was great!

<Content>Great rooms, great location We stayed in the hotel for the first time in late December 2004. It is centrally located, the rooms are spotless, and the beds are particularly cozy. The hotel design is fun and modern. The bar also has a great buzz about it.My only criticism is that the valet parking is painfully slow and very expensive. It took about 20 minutes to get our car, and this was at 2 PM without a major event at the hotel. All in all, an excellent stay, and this will be our hotel of choice in Boston from now on.

<Content>Excellent Boston Hotel Jury's recently opened hotel in Boston, a superb renovation of the old Boston police headquarters, is a great addition to this premier Irish group. Nice location in Back Bay. Well done, very comfortable rooms. Mostly Irish staff. Pub and restaurant are top notch and quite popular locally. Altogether, a wonderful base in the city.

<Content>Wow!!!! My family and I stayed at this brand new hotel for 4 nights (12/7 to 12/11/2004) and it was wonderful. A small and cozy hotel with professional staffs that are eager to help you with any problem or issue you may have during your stay. The decor is very modern and innovative as well. Especially the fireplaces they have in the lobby is quite interesting. The free internet access inside the room and at the business center was a welcome sight to make nightly checks on my emails and conduct research online.Great job!!!

<Content>All trace of the cops is gone This may have the old police headquarters in Boston, but not a trace of its forensic past remains. The gorgeous building has been transformed into a stylish, comfortable, friendly, home from home in Boston. Located in the Back Bay area, just behind the John Hancock Tower, it is steps from everywhere.The bedrooms are well fitted out with very comfortable, feather-topped mattresses. if you can't sleep here, you can't sleep anywhere. Staff are very friendly and everyone seems to do everything. Dinner at the Stanhope Grill is a must, or even breakfast. Bostonians seem to have discovered Cuffs Bar and it is lively, even at the weekends.

<Content>Jurys Is A Hit Stayed for 2 nights, one for business the other for vacation. I can't wait to go back.I was very impressed with the ammenities, huge plush cotton towels, Aveda toiletries, down comforter and pillows, very comfy bed, nice robes, even an umbrella in the closet. Gorgeous fabrics  furnishings. My room was on the small side, but the luxurious appointments more than made up for it. I also highly recommend the waffles for breakfast, I think they were the best I've ever had!I would recommend trying this hotel.

<Content>A beautiful and unique hotel We stayed at Jury's for a weekend in Boston, and Wow - it is exquisite. The decor and amenities are first rate in every respect. The hotel restaurant looked terrific, too, but we ate somewhere else. Next time we'll just go downstairs. Jury's is not cheap, we paid about 240$ before taxes, but compared to other similarly priced hotels in Boston, I'd say it was the best that I know.

<Content>Jury's is a superb hotel We have just returned from touring New England, our trip included a three night stay in Boston at The Jury's Inn. The Hotel is superb, the quality of the furnishings and decor is excellent as is the cleanliness. The towels were changed twice a day and when we came back to the room in the evening it had been tidied , the bed turned down and soft music was playing. The reception staff were friendly and extremely efficient as were all the staff. the hotel must rank as one of the best in Boston, I would not hesitate to recommend this Hotel to anyone, enjoy the luxury!

<Content>Excellent Hotel, but.. watch out for valet parking!! We just had gotten back from PR, and YES.. Storm/Hurraciane Jeanne spoiled most of our vacation. So, we still had a few days off and booked 3 more nights at Jurys. New property in the neighborhood.. And something about staying at a former Police station was, well.. U know.... The hotel is absolutely beautiful.. The room was magnificent. The bathroom... wow. Shower glass stall, separate tub, bathrobes, and the shower has a little surprise..... The beds, you get lost in them. The food, outstanding. The French Onion Soup,, ooollalla... Room service outstanding. The burgers downstairs, fat and juicey. We had a car for two nights only. I even informed the doorman and valet guy that the car was no longer in the premises. At check-Out time, there was an extra $34.00 added to my bill.. Well, I said that was incorrect. And the attitude was like I was lying. I live down the street!!! The valet company is not owned by the hotel... blah, blah, blah... I got the account straighten out, but I almost paid the $34.00 just to get it over with. When I got home, 5 minutes later, I did call and spoke to a manager.... She offer free dinner, free drinks.. I said. NO thanks... I will be back, but I will be walking like I should have done right from the start...

<Content>Great time at Jurys Boston Hotel October 11,2004My husband and I just returned from a weekend in Boston and stayed at the Jurys Boston Hotel. After reading the the good reviews on tripadvisor I booked the reservation and was not disappointed. The location was ideal close to the T and shopping at Copley and Newberry st. The rooms were adequete in size and one should be out and about in a town like Boston and not holed up in your room! The check in was friendly with Claire and the bellman told us about the restaurant Skipjack just a few blocks away that was fabulous. And after walking all day to come back to your room with a wonderful bed to snuggle in was lovely. Both the room and bathroom are nicely appointed in soothing colors and the heated towel rack was a plus. We had room service both mornings and though the menu is not extensive it did take only 10 minutes to get to us. We will definitely be back.

<Content>The 'Jury' is still out! Disappointing say. The hotel is very new and is in places not yet finished ( walls not painted, missing panels etc.) The fixtures in our room were showing signs of coming apart (Draps hanging of the rail which was losse to the wall)The bar is very popular with the locals, especially at the end of the office day. Consequently when you descend as a hotel guest, you will be lucky to find somewhere to sit, and even more lucky to get decent service.Got a wake up call at 7:00am which we did not request, and when explaining our concerns to the front desk, they were totally not interested, they did not even respond to our comments!!We valet parked our car, and whilst waiting at the door for our car to be returned, the young man waiting to escort us to the car, began explaining how he was tempted to take some of the better cars for a spin around the block, infact I may just do that one day he continued...not with my car, we will not be back!Punjabi
