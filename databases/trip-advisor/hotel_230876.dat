<Content>Great Location This hotel is fine for travellers who wish to explore the city, not hang out at the hotel. It is located a 10 minute walk from the centre of town and is a short walk to the Dam and Anne Frank's. The rooms are sufficient but small. They room was clean enough as was the washroom. They serve a basic breakfast of toast, tea and cereal. For those with mobility concerns this is not the hotel for you as there are about 50 steep stairs to climb just to get to the reception area. It is inconvenient but typical of the buildings in Amsterdam. The staff can be helpful and the restaurant just outside has great food. Definitely 'no frills' accomodation but will do for those that aren't too picky.

<Content>Hotel Di-Ann - bit of a disappointment Hotel website was no good for booking the hotel, it does not take your payment, you have to pay in person at the hotel when you leave. But it is there to reserve a room. Remember that.The hotel had pubic hairs on the toilet seat and fridge door! Not pleasant. The stairs are very steep and illegal in size and they last forever and there is no lift so take a small case. The bed sheets were clean as was most of the room besides stray hairs from a previous visitor. The rooms are very boring and small and have not been decorated for decades.The breakfast is just basic toast, coffee, tea, cereal, yogurts, fresh juice. There is a computer in this room for internet access which was good.The hotel is right near Dam Square so location could not be better. The staff were not very helpful or friendly.You can smoke in non smoking rooms.Overall I thought it would be a nightmare when I arrived, but I got used to the place, although I would not choosed to stay there again, I would look for an alternative. I guess thats what you expect from a 2 star.

<Content>One to avoid - the Di-Ann in Amsterdam We booked this hotel online through 'easytobook' as it is centrally located. We went for a deluxe double room at 鈧?50 a night initially and 鈧?10 thereafter; we only stayed one night of three booked and wouldn't have done that if we'd been able to find alternative accommodation sooner. A very steep flight of about 70 stairs leads to a pokey reception area. The room had a balcony and (just) a canal view but it was about 8 feet square and there was barely room to move. The wardrobe had two hangers, one broken with nails sticking out; the loo didn't flush properly and the tv remote was broken. We made comparisons with other hotels for prices and the Di-Ann is a major rip-off. I was happy to pay for the second night (unused) just to get out of there. Sheets and towels were at least clean, but prices were higher than nearby 3-star hotels and only very close behind the 4-star American Hotel. Raadhuisstraat is a miserable street and contains many similar hotels, so avoid them!

<Content>Good value central hotel We did a long week-end in Amsterdam and thought this hotel was great. Yes the rooms are small but what do you expect in a typical Amsterdam building, which all tend to be tall and narrow? The beds were comfortable and clean, as was the rest of the room.We had a problem with the key card but the staff came up straight away to help us out. We found the staff in general very polite and helpful and they let us leave our luggage there on the last day.Breakfast was more than adequate.We really enjoyed our stay here and would be more than happy to stay again. It's also in a great location, really close to Dam Square and a lot of the main sights.

<Content>Worst of the worst We stayed at the Hotel Di-Ann for three nights in September. It's too bad that places like this can remain in business and ruin the reputation of a wonderful city like Amsterdam. The room was extremely small, the safe didn't work, the breakfast was unfit for human consumption...we both became ill... and the staff was rude and dishonest. To make things worse, they pretended their credit card maching was not working and demanded cash at checkout. Don't fall for this scam. This dive is the worst place in Amsterdam and probably all of Europe.

<Content>You get what you pay for My husband and I were looking for an inexpensive room that was centrally located. We got it. The hotel has a fantastic location. Sure, the stairs are steep, but that's common. What was worse was the staff and our room. The staff wasn't helpful and could hardly understand English. Our room was small, which was fine, but it wasn't very clean or well maintained. The room was on the street, which was very noisy. The weather was quite warm when we were there, but we had to close the window at night because of the noise. Also, the refrigerator didn't work. The breakfast was ok, nothing special. For the money you could probably find something better, but the location is tough to beat.

<Content>Quick visit Friendly and helpful staff. Had a small problem with the safe in the room and they sent someone immediately to look after it. Small room and long, narrow stair-case, winding at the top. We had the second floor so we did it twice. TOn our canal cruise, they explained why most of the buildings have staircases like this. It is because of land space and population density. So it appears that you will encounter this in most buildings/hotels. Blankets were a bit old and had a couple small holes in them. Breakfast was great. Lots to choose from to eat and drink. We were able to leave our luggage at the front desk after we checked out in order to walk around for a few hours. Directions to hotel from Amsterdam Centraal Stn:Walk out of station, keep right, cross the canal and continue walking straight. until you get to Raadhuisstraat. You will recognize this street by the long phalic-like symbol on the left side of the street, there are steps on the bottom where people sit and relax...also lots of pigeons. Mak a right on Raadhuisstraat toward the Magna Plaza, then make a quick left and a quick right, cross the canal and the hotel is on the left.

<Content>Overpriced but decent hotel, great location. We arrived in Amsterdam on a Saturday without a hotel reservation. One of the few affordable hotels we were able to get was the Di Ann. We needed a room for five people. Di Ann had a quad room available but they could fit a matress on the floor. The matress didn麓t really fit but it worked. There was a smell of weed in some of the hallways, but then it is Amsterdam after all.. We paid 220 Euro麓s for our room. The only justification for that price could be the central location. Bathroom was tiny. I am 1.90 m and I could not sit straight on the toilet, but it was clean. Breakfast was included in the price.If you are disabled or have difficulty walking you need to know that this hotel has no elevator and very steep stairs. I would stay here again, but only because of its location.

<Content>Love love LOVE the Di Ann I stayed at this hotel 7th-10th March with my boyfriend and it was fantastic. Its not 5 star luxury but it did exactly what it said on the tin. Linen and towels were changed everyday, the reception staff were lovely and sooo helpful (especially with directing us to the late night convenience store one night!). They even looked fter luggage while we killed time before going to the airport. The cat was cute but didnt really see much of it! Ok, breakfast is the same every day but WHO CARES! I love toast and cereal so was good enough for me! one thing i will say was they need another toaster! But if you get to breakfast early enough...... it so happened our room was right next door so we were always there quite promptly.The location of the hotel is perfect and for the money we paid we couldnt have asked for more. Its in the middle of everywhere and boy did we walk everywhere!! The stairs would not be suitable for those of limited mobility (although there were quite a few older ladies staying there at the same time and they seemed to manage ok) if anything though it keeps you fit. there is a delightful pancake cafe downstairs and to the immediate right and also to the right after walking for 10-15 mins there is a late night convenience store (as beforementioned this was told to us by the night reception guy) handy for one more bottle of wine!We did sooo much but there was still sooo much more we didnt have time for so are definitely going back later this year. And yes we will definitely be staying at the Di Ann.

<Content>Hotel Di Ann is awful From the picture it looked perfect. The location is brilliant some of the staff were very friendly and the cat is lovely. We were so looking forward to seeing Amsterdam but the minute we walked into our room our hearts sank. It was tired, dark, dingy and dirty. If I had not seen a sign saying no guests I would have said it was a very low class knocking shop. We slept in our clothes ontop of the bed as the sheets were marked and showered in our socks so as not to come into contact with the floor. We stayed out as late as we could to spend as little time in the room as possible. Breakfast was as tired as the room but we had to eat it to give us the energy to stay out!! In some respects it did spoil our trip as it was the first time we had been away for 4 years but Amsterdam is lovely I would deffinately go again but never to that hotel.

<Content>Cheap room in a central location The best feature of the Di-Ann has to be its central location. We thought it might be noisy but we didn't have any problems at all. I wonder whether rooms at the front would hear the passing traffic but most of the accommodation is well above street level. There is a huge steep staircase from the street to reception and at least one further staircase to get to the rooms. They are small and a little tired but ours was very clean. We choose the hotel as we were travelling with a single person and the single room supplements were very reasonable. Breakfast is self service. There's not much of a selection but we weren't paying big bucks so we didn't mind. The hotel is a stone's throw from Dam Square and at the end of an evening it was nice to know that our room was only a few steps away. A centrally located hotel that's ok for a stay of 2 or 3 nights but I wouldn't want any longer there. For a first trip to Amsterdam I would suggest paying just a little more and getting a room in one of the town house hotels that line the canals.

<Content>Hotel Di-Ann was not to bad. We stayed at the Hotel Di-Ann for 2 nights in September 07 the hotel was not to bad for a 2 star, yes the staircase was terrible best to take a backpack if you are going there. The room was very small however not having the table and chairs from the room might make it a bit easier to move around and have more space to put your things. It was great having the small fridge allowed you to have drinks ect. We didnt eat the breakfast it didn't really appeal to us but there are quite a few places in the area to get a good breakfast at a reasonable price. The location of the hotel was great close to everything. If I went back to Amsterdam I would probably stay elsewhere unfortunatly this time there was not alot available.

<Content>Loved Amsterdam, Hotel not great Booked flights to Amsterdam for New year 2006-2007 and we were struggling to find budget accomodation for our dates since going over new year, so a friend recommended this hotel and warned us that it wasnt the best!When we arrived I was very disappointed with the rooms. Very shabby and small and one of the plug points was hanging off the wall!The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from Dam Sq and a few mins walk from the Anne-Frank Museum. We didnt see that many other people staying in the hotel. Although the location was good, I wouldnt recommend this hotel and would advise to look elsewhere, maybe last minute.com or expedia. Breakfast was not good at all and we didnt bother to go after the first night! beware - very steep stairs!

<Content>scruffy and cramped the room in this hotel was scruffy and cramped. it is claimed that the hotel was upgraded in about 1999 so i hate to think what the rooms were like then! we had a double room overlooking the gardens (nice view) but there was hardly room to swing a cat (or should that be kitten?). we had a small en-suite, a fridge but no drink making facilities. staff were very friendly and the buffet breakfast adequate. the only saving grace for this hotel is its location directly behind the palace in dam square, only two minutes walk.i would not have minded so much but the room was not that cheap.

<Content>Authentic Amsterdam stay We stayed at the hotel Di Ann for one night on our frist stop of a 2 week trip through Europe. I picked the hotel because I wanted something more authentic, rather than staying in a typical hotle chain. I was not dissapointed! We arrived at about 6:30 am and they had our room ready. It was on the 4th floor so needless to say, there were a whole lot of steep steps to get there. The room was itty bitty and the bathroom was tiny but it served it's purpose well for one night. We also had a room with a little balcony, which helped make it feel less clausterphobic. Since we were only in the city for 2 days, we spent nearly no time in the room, so it really was needed just to sleep and shower in. The hotel was in an okay location but after walking around the city, we saw hotels we liked the locations of much better. Overall, this hotel is worth staying at if you can get a cheap rate and don't mind stairs.

<Content>Hotel Di Ann~Perfect Location~Cute Cat~Tidy Room My friend and I were at the Hotel Di Ann this weekend and had a very pleasant stay. The infamous stairs were there and are very steep, not wheel chair or stroller friendly as there is no elevator. But we had no problems and the staff offer all the help you need. The hotel staff was very friendly and the cat is just too cute  very friendly! We had a room with a balcony (awesome views). The batthroom and room itself was satisfactory, both were clean and cozy. The room is a little small but has enough room....we didnt go to Amsterdam to hang out in our room the whole time. We needed a safe, clean  comfortable place to sleep and shower. The hotel is super close to resturants, shopping, coffee shops, places of interest and bars...Ann Frank House right around the corner. All in All, I WOULD DEFINATELY STAY AGAIN...THANKS TO THE HOTEL AND STAFF FOR A PLEASANT STAY!Lena~ United States

<Content>More a hostel than a hotel This hotel is only suitable for the non fussy traveller looking for a bed for a couple of nights. It's location is ideal but the block is shabby. On arrival we were given the key to a room that was already occupied, the staff barely spoke to us while they sorted out the problem. The bathroom in our room was large and clean, but the room was tiny and very very basic, the curtains were covered in hairs! The breakfast was yuck. Stale cornflakes, warm milk, slices of processed cheese and very hard boiled eggs. There was a toaster to toast the cheappo sliced bread but it only toasted one side. I am not at all fussy but wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. More like a hostel than a hotel which would be fine if it was hostel priced.

<Content>Basic but Fine The hotel is basic and the rooms are small ( well it is a town house). We were lucky, we had a balcony which made the stay ok. The breakfast could do with a choice of cereal, cornflakes are a bit boring after a few days. Tea/coffee tray was free but you had to ask for it. If you just want somewhere for B  B to explore the city it's a good place to stay. within easy reach of all the attractions but far anough away from the tourist centre to get a good sleep.

<Content>Hotel DiAnn was only ok Fourth floor room was cramped and worn, old and dinghy carpets.The four flights of stairs were not fun but great exercise. Location was excellent although that particular block is a bit run down. Cat was great. Breakfast was very basic - wish they had real cheese and colder milk but hey, we ate for fuel. Reception will book shuttle to airport for you. We were fully aware this was a 2-star hotel so it was pretty much what we expected.

<Content>Please stay away, onless you are a 20something! Do not believe the photos, there really isn't much beyond the outer architectural details of the building and the cute calico cat that offer any charm at the Hotel Di-Ann. In Holland, one of the lands of great cheeses, a processed cheese food is served at breakfast! The bathroom has such a slow shower drain that the entire room floods even for the swiftest of bathers. Any request is met with a smile and a shake of the head, but don't hold your breath, and don't thnk you won't be repeating that same request. They could do a few, easy things, and have a cleaner, more pleasant establishment. They have a good central location--the rest can and should be fixed!

<Content>No thanks Don't like this hotel. Unfriendly staff, really messy room and halls. We had to ask for a rag to clean the room, because the staff didn't wipe it. They hadn't cleaned it for our arrival either. I wanted to ask for a vacuum cleaner aswell. We asked for the towels ourselves. Full of dust - the bedspread had old stains on it for example. The breakfast wasn't tasty - low budget food.Hard to sleep because of the refrigerator in the room- really noisy.One of the staff was friendly. He came with coffee facilities. The cat was cute also. And the location is good. There's so many other hotels in amsterdam, so next time we will book in another place.

<Content>the place to stay in Torteguero What can i say? this hotel is the best place to stay in the whole of Amsterdam, the location was first class couldn't do better the people in the hotel were lovely, rooms were fine clean and tidy the main thing i look for. breakfast was nice too. We got a room with a balcony which overlooked the canal it was stunning - very romantic only had to look down the road and you could see the royal palace.Overall i found Amsterdam fantastic everything is go all the time and the amount of bicycles in Amsterdam- well it must put bejing to shame! they are everywhere they even got parking tickets for their bikes when they parked them up against lamp posts! it's a different way of life and very enjoyable place to visit any time of the year we went in november and i was very surprised at how warm it was. if you go you should definitely stay at the di ann highly reccomend it!!

<Content>fantastic!!!! we (two girls) stayed for two nights at the hotel di-ann, first impressions were the stairs!!! we needed help to get the cases up them!!! they are very steep and wind at the top! Second impression was the size of the room - you couldnt of had a guest to stay with you as there wouldnt be enough air to go round! no cat swinging here! We booked the hotel for its location - which is excellent, you can walk everywhere as you are not far from Dam Square. Breakfast was dissapointing - toast or cornflakes. But an excellent and hot shower made up for this! Staff are friendly and helpful.All in all we felt this was a good choice of hotel for value and its location.

<Content>fantastic the di ann is only about a 10 min walk from the train station, but there are many trams that go right past the station and will drop right outside, when we arrived nothing will pre-pare you for the stairs but this is traditional in these old buildings! when we reached the reception the staff where very happy and inviting, we checked in, (note: 20 euro is to be paid on arrival which is given back to you at the end of your stay, this is a deposit for your room key and remote control for you tv in room) the lady at reception gave us some guides to amsterdam and also a map which came in really handy!! :) the staff there also offered to carry our bags to our room for us. When we arrived in our room, we where pleasently surprised by how clean and bright it was, we had a lovely balcony which over looked the canal and the streets outside with french doors opening in wards, although the room was a little small it had everything we needed and the bath room was very clean with fresh towels and soap everyday!! we really enjoyed our stay at the Di Ann hotel, and the cleaning staff where exceptional with the room sparkling clean every evening when we returned, with fresh bed linen. We have never stayed in a 2 star hotel before, always choosing to stay in at least a 4 star, but i would definatly recomend this hotel to anyone and we will definatly be going back again :) the location was fantastic the people where so friendly and we really had a fantastic time. tips: if your looking for local places to eat and little shops to buy provisions i would recomend the italian on the corner, which makes fantastic pizzas, also the little shop next door which has really frienly staff and about anything you want! these are all to the right of the Di Ann when come out the door.

<Content>Don't do it - Extremely tiny rooms, dirty and expensive Dirty toilet, the blanket sheet was used (!!) and full with unknown stains. We asked to change it with a clean one and we got an answer that they will change it only during the morning. The guy at the reception desk was smoking all night long and the smoke got straight to our room. The room was more liks a solitary confinement. We paid 140 euro per night. We left after one night and stayd for one night at the NH Doelen (4 stars hotel!) for 94 euro per night and two nights at the NH Tropen (3 stars hotel) for 56 euro per night - two excellent hotles.

<Content>Adequate 2 star - nothing more! This is a decent 2 star hotel but nothing more. I have never seen a room this small before - about the width of a double bed, NO LIE, and a bathroom definitely meant for one. Intimate doesn't quite cover it! On the upside, it is very clean (except for the knickers I found on the stairs on day 2) and there are extremely friendly staff. The downside is there are far better locations such as on the peaceful canals (this, while central, over looks a busy road, you can only really see the canals if you can see around corners, or have one of the rooms right by Herengracht). Also when we stayed there were rowdy groups of stoners staying who stank out the hotel with fag/hash smoke, and i was woken up 2 out of 3 nights by the people in the room next door. they were not particularly loud, but the walls are SO ineffective, it only takes a conversation to bellow through and wake you.Also, watch out for the $20 deposit they take from you for the remote control and key. Why, goodness knows, although they do return it...The cat is a BIG plus, but if you are at all allergic to cats, give it a miss - as she goes into the rooms and roams the corridors looking for friends. She even got into our bed at one point.If money is a problem or you will be out on the slash, Di Ann will do the job. If you are in a couple or have a few euros to spare, i'd look somewhere else as you will probably be disappointed. While not horrendous, it was definitely the low point of what was a wonderful trip to this amazing city. Sorry!

<Content>good value, great location We booked a deluxe room with a balcony and you still could not swing a cat it was so small, however it was still a great value, clean and comfortable budget BB. On the positive side the beds were very comfortable, the view of the canal was nice. Breakfast, although very basic was a great start to the day. The staff and the cat were very friendly. The location was great, we did not have to catch transport anywhere.On the down side, nothing on this earth will prepare you for the stairs!!! I had read many reviews all noting the steep stairs, but when you arrive and see them your mouth will drop in shock. it is obviously a trademark of many BBs in Amsterdam and not exclusive to this hotel. our deluxe room was on the 1st floor so we were lucky to only have to climb the first set. if you are fit and healthy, it only presents a problem when transporting your suitcases. be careful if you book a smoking room like we did as when we entered our room till we left 2 days after, the room and our clothes stank of cannabis from the previous occupants. This may or may not bother you (depending on your purpose of visiting), but it is worth knowing.Overall. a great spot to stay with a friend for a couple of days. I would definitely stay again although if i was traveling for romance purposes i would probably spend a bit more and go for something more up market.

<Content>Tiny room, good location, ok breakfast, overpriced I read all the reviews on all the sites but was still surprised (and dissapointed) on the size of the room, it is obviously a normal sized room split into two. However, it is quite clean with a change of towels each day and the location is very good. Breakfast is toast, hard boiled eggs, coffee and orange juice and as much of it as you want. The stairs weren't as steep as I thought they would be. I thought that for 270Euros for three days I might have got a bit better for my money???

<Content>Great location, friendly staff After reading some positive reviews on here about the Di-ann hotel i decided to go ahead and book it for my fellas 30th. It was exactly what i expected. Our room was however a little bit too small but it was one of the smallest as it was right at the top with two tiny windows but i think this is managable, especially for a weekend break. The bed was not the most comfy bed i had slept in but again it did the job. It was actually two single beds pushed together and it was rather small but i was happy with it and i think most peple would be the same.The bathroom was spot on. The shower was so powerful and we were offered clean towels, toilet roll and soap every morning.Their were no drinks facilities in the rooms but somewhere it stated that these were avalible upon request which is fair enougth really!Breakfast was fine, toast, cheese, cereal and boiled eggs and always enougth to go around the breakfast time wasnt to bad either 7 till half 10.....so still time for a sleep in heh!The housekeeping guys were always hard at work and the rooms were cleaned everymorning. Ours wasnt as we were always in it (late nights!!)The locatation is the best thing about this hotel, and Amsterdam is the most beautiful city. The staff are really helpful. I did pay a little to much for this hotel....i think i prolly should have had a deluxe room instead of the smallest of the small but i still had an awesome time!P.S The stairs really are that bad!!!

<Content>Good hotel, great location 3 of us stayed in a triple room this october. The room was quite small but cosy, we had a great view and a brilliant balcony. The hotel breakfast is quite good, but only basic with toast, cereal and cheese. The hotel staff are lovely and really helpful. They will lend you a travel adapter and kettle. They are happy to let you in at 3 in the morning, and will help you find your way. It is definitely worth getting a deluxe room and a balcony. The hotel will let you leave you baggage with them before you can book in and on your day of departure. The location is great, 2 minute walk to Dam square, 10 minute walk to the leidsplein and there are trams just down the road. There is a restaurant just underneath the hotel and a supermarket round the corner which are both good prices. The stairs are incredibly steep to the recpetion but its not a problem, we just laughed about them. The hotel did help us get our baggage down them. The hotel cat was very friendly, and can be found in your suitcase keeping warm if your not careful. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Good location 3 adults stayed 2 nights in a triple room in late September 2006. The location is great for people who wish to walk because everything is within walking distance. We went to the Heineken Experience, the Anne Frank House, the Pancake Bakery, The Hard Rock Cafe, and all over the central city and enjoyed walking. There are trams all over to use if you need to but we liked walking. We stayed out of the bike lanes and we were fine. The hotel is above other stores so there is a narrow stairway to the hotel lobby which was not easy with our luggage. The room was very very tiny with 3 twin beds, but we had a little fridge and tv and a balcony which was so nice and the view was wonderful! Also in their breakfast area they offer free internet access - we had our own laptop and it was free. They also have 2 computers there, I'm not sure if those would have been free or not. The breakfast was very good. They have a cat there who is very sweet and friendly! A calico named Kiko. i enjoyed the cat since I missed my pets at home. The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly too.

<Content>great value for money stayed here for 2 nights,very good location and payed 60euros with breakfast. Hotel is basic but clean and very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are small,old but comfortable. Would recommend this hotel. Only one thing as in a lot of hotels in Amsterdam to enter you must walk up a very very steep set of stairs. Could be a problem if your an elderly traveller especially with a suitcase.

<Content>Great hotel, great location Great hotel with an excellent location on the corner of Herrengracht. Dam Square is only a five minute walk away, (if you manage to avoid getting killed by a tram or a cyclist!), and we managed to walk to all the major attractions (e.g. Rijks Museum) in under half an hour. That is a pleasant stroll along the canals. The Red Light district with its many bars and clubs is within a 15 minute walk, though the hotel is in a pleasant and safe part of town. The room was a bit basic but no real complaints, and the stairs up to the hotel from the street were a bit steep, but there again that's quite common in Amsterdam. Breakfast was self service - bread, toast, cheese, eggs, coffee, tea, juice etc. and plenty of it! The best bit? Kiku the friendly hotel cat. Bet she's forgotten us already!!

<Content>Good location We just got back from staying 2 nights at the Di-Ann hotel.We thought the location was great. It was really close to the Anne Frank house, the Homomonument and the Dam Center which is central to the trams. You could use the internet for 3 Euro an hour which was cheap.The breakfast was toast, eggs, juice, coffee and cereal. Nothing too big, but enough to get you started. They need another toaster as that was the biggest wait for breakfast. The area is clean but can be really crowded depending on when you eat.The room was for 2 adults and 2 children. It was 4 twin beds with a TV and mini frig on the 4th floor. It was quiet at night which was good. The beds were comfortable and clean. The TV has a lot of English stations. The price for us was 160 Euro. A good price when I was comparing hotels. It definitely wasn't anythng fancy but it was good for our trip. We asked for a fan and they let us use a small one for the room. We wanted this mostly for background noise, not because it was hot.The people were helpful and would answer any questions.The stairs are VERY Steep like everyone said but easy if you don't have any problems walking. The kids thought they were fun.I felt safe at the hotel. They had a buzzer with someone there 24 hours to let you in so I thought that was good.I would stay there again if we went back!

<Content>loved it! we couldnt wait to see the stairs...and they were everything we thought they'd be and more!! we giggled all the way to reception and then all the way up two more flights of stairs! our room was the furthest room of the hotel but our view was brilliant. It was cosy and clean, with a slanting roof giving it character! Every morning we were greeted with a smile, and the people in reception were always willing to help us. the fecking cat followed us all the way up to a room and ran in, but just show it whos boss and it gets the message! all in all, we had a brilliant stay. we never had breakfast in, so cant comment, we always went out, trying different cafes etc. I suggest doing that, its far more fun. Don't expect five star stuff here, but if you treat them nicely, they'll do the same in return!! we had a wonderfully romantic stay with memories to last a lifetime.

<Content>Great Location We booked a triple room for myself, a friend, and my 6 yr old son, upstairs on the fourth floor, for 3 nights, from May 22 to 25.I had previously read all the moaning comments about the steep stairs, but we made a joke of them...it was like climbing Mt Everest every day, after a full day of sight-seeing. All we could do was laugh about them, and being very fit, found them no problem, even carrying our luggage up and down them.We enjoyed our stay at the hotel and found it very central to Amsterdam, for sight-seeing. The Bike shop was close by, to hire bikes, and the central train station was only a short walk as well.We found the staff very friendly; the room was clean; the cat was friendly; and the breakfast basic.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great location, shame about the stairs! We stayed in the Di-ann for 2 nights from 3-5 June 06, and could not have asked for a better base for exploring Amsterdam.The hotel is bang in the centre of town, a short walk from the museums, red light district, dam square and central station, but tucked out of the way of the 'fruitier' side of the city.The staff were incredibly friendly, they speak very good English, and are always willing to help with directions- they were even friendly when we locked our key in the room.The rooms are basic and quite small, but are clean, have a free fridge and safe, and offer great views, we could see the palace, magna plaza, canal, and Westerkerk from our room!We were at the front of the hotel, and there was some road noise, but i'm a light sleeper and had no probs with the noise. The complimentary breakfast is basic but fits the bill, and there is a supermarket next to the hotel that sells plenty of beer, wine and food.The only down side is definately the stairs, we had read other reviews saying how steep they were but the warnings didnt prepare us for the near vertical staircase we found!Theres no denying these are steep stairs, there is no lift and our room was on the 4th floor. If you have mobility problems you really should give this hotel a miss, but everyone else should not let a few stairs put them off what is otherwise a great hotel!

<Content>Good location This hotel is in a good location. It was easy to get to all the attractions on foot. We enjoyed the balcony to watch the city while slowing down a little. You can hear the church bells ring well from here also.The stairs are steep and the room we had was VERY SMALL, but the price was good. My complaint is that we were charged 25 euro as a deposit on the room key, which is highly unusual. We were told we would get this back when we checked out, however, we forgot and the staff neglected to bring up the issue, so we paid an extra 25 euro. It seemed like a cheap trick in a city where many tourist might be distracted by the time they check out..

<Content>Excellent Budget Hotel The last time we were in Amsterdam in January 2005 we stayed at The Nadia, but as that was slightly out of our price range this time round now that it is mid-season, we stayed at The Hotel Di-Ann a few doors down. We paid about 拢100 each for 4 nighs bed and breakfast. The 2 hotels are extremely alike in every way. Rooms are mostly tiny but cosy, the stairs are many and steep and the staff are helpful and friendly. You get a bigger choice at breakfast at the Nadia, but on the other hand, the Di-Ann is cheaper, has nicer bathrooms and has the most gorgeous friendly little cat ever!The location is excellent (5 minutes from Dam Square, 2 minutes from Westerkerk  Anne Frank's House) and there are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby. The rooms all have fridges so you can stock up on cold drinks and snacks from the supermarket down the road (turn left on leaving the hotel and it's on your left just after the 1st road you cross. There is also a bigger one on the way to Dam Square) While we were there we borrowed a travel adaptor plug and a kettle for the whole of our stay without charge. The rooms all have safes (again no charge) and we were lucky enough to get a room on the 4th floor with a huge balcony so our views were great. You do have to pay a 20 Euro deposit for your tv remote control but you get this back when you check out.Breakfast is OK, but quite basic. Lovely fresh coffee which you help yourself to, cornflakes and white or brown bread with a rather slow toaster provided. There are lots of different teas, jams and spreads, plus cheese.The only downside was that the trams can be pretty noisy if your room is at the front of the hotel as ours was. They run from about 6am to about midnight. This was OK in the winter as we kept the windows closed but if I was going back in the summer I would ask for a back room.All in all an excellent budget hotel and great value for the price if you don't mind a few stairs! We would definitely go back.

<Content>Great budget hotel!!!! Hi, i visited the hotel Di anne for two nights, with some of the lads, it has a very central location for the popular attractions such as the Dam square, Red light and in the other direction some fun bars and great clubs! I found the staff very helpful  spoke english well. The rooms are small and the en-suite very tight but if your worried about that sort of thing you should expect like anywhere to pay more. (and plus on holiday why would you wonna stay in your hotel for to long! lol) the hotel in general in clean and does what it said on the tin. a great budget2 star hotel!

<Content>Excellent budget hotel 2-star hotel with the steepest staircase imaginable. However, the location was fantastic, only minutes away from Anne Frank house and Dam Square. Nice pubs and restaurants in the vicinity too, if you don't want to walk. Room was very small but adequate for two people. Shower/toilet en-suite and small balcony too. Breakfast typical of European budget hotels - coffee, orange juice, toast, eggs, cheese, jam. Enough to set you up for a day's sightseeing. Staff very helpful and friendly. If you're looking for 5-star luxury don't stay here, but as a budget hotel in a great location, it's absolutely ideal. We would return and recommend it to our friends (the ones who don't always stay at the Sheraton!)

<Content>Great hotel for the price Ok, yes the stairs are steep but if you know the history of Amsterdam, you know why they are steep. (Taxes were based on width of home so most older buildings are very tall and not very wide, thus creating stairs that don't take a lot of space). I thought the people were extremely friendly and they carried my luggage up the steep steps. We even managed a visit from the hotel cat, who is quite sweet and loving. I stayed for 5 nights and was quite happy. Incredible location...close to everything. It is extremely noisy facing the street so ask for a rear room, if available. Otherwise, make sure you buy ear plugs. Breakfast was more than adequate but beware of the toasters. Clean and tidy but again, you get what you pay for. If you want 3 or 4 star style for the price you pay here, you will surely be disappointed. I would stay again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Absolutely Fine at the Di - Ann After reading the reviews of lots of Hotels in Amsterdam I settled on the Di- Ann as I was going to Amsterdam to run in the Half Marathon and wanted a safe and secure and reasonably priced base. The staff were very friendly and welcoming giving me a map on arrival and the hotel clean. When I needed advice about directions they were pleased to help.Yes the stairs are steep but so what - free exercise thrown in and not untypical for the city. My room a superior single was small but had a balcony and ensuite. TV included French  German stations as well as BBC1  BBC2 (you have to give a 20EUR deposit for the remote).Breakfast is as described - cereal, coffee, tea and toast with a variety of jams, cheese or egg). It was fine. I paid 143EUR for 2 nights on apopular weekend - I thought it was reasonable value for this city and a central location.

<Content>never again!! what a dump!! stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, the stairs were steep as people have been saying, the staff were unfriendly at reception. breakfast very basic(boiled egg, cereal,tea,coffee,juice,bread,cheese,jam. help your self job and not much of it put out!)the room was small as reviews, bathroom was small and looked dirty. was promised hairdryer in room and tea/coffee making facilities but zilch. we arranged an early breakfast for the day we left but got up to breakfast room and was served nothing(no staff was awake, the receptionist didnt speak english). on arrival we had to give 20 euros for tv control which we got back)..we got covered in either mossie bites or flea bites too. this is the worst hotel i've ever stayed in. the only good side of things was the complimentary sweets at reception!!!!....the room cost 拢80 a night and was the pits!!!!...think twice before you book here!!

<Content>Good value Just returned from 2 nights at the Di-Ann and i have to say that i was impressed by the place. It doesnt look much from the outside, and the stairs really are as severe as other people have said, but for the money you pay i dont think this hotel can be faulted. Received a very warm welcome when we arrived. When we left for dinner on our first evening we informed the reception clerk that our shower wasnt working properly, when we returned a few hours later the problem had been fixed. The room was small, but this was my 4th trip to Amsterdam and i am yet to stay in a massive room and some other places charge lots more than the Di-Ann. The location is ideal, far enough away from the more colourful side of the city but within 15 minutes walk if you do want to indulge!! Everything else is either within walking distance, or you can use the many trams that pass by outside. We managed to get a room at the back of the hotel so it was very quiet, but we did have to sacrifice a nice view for that pleasure but it meant we had 2 good nights sleep. The breakfast was good with all the usual food on offer, toast, boiled eggs, cereals, tea and coffee etc etc. All in all this is excellent value for money in an ideal location from which to explore the city. If you want a massive suite with an a la carte restaurant dont stay here, but if you want a good value for money, clean and friendly place to use as a base then this is the place to stay. I certainly wouldnt hesitate to reserve another room.

<Content>Small but perfectly formed This hotel is very similar to Hotel Nadia and only a few doors down. The rooms are small, but this is to be expected in Amsterdam, but they are cleaned daily and are comfortable. The staff are also polite. I got my single room for about 60 euro's a night, which given the location is pretty good, it's right behing Dam square. I would definately stop again.

<Content>Great Value Spent three nights there. Small room but just big enough. Decent breakfast but not great. Great location. Quiet street. It met my criteria exactly. Helpful staff. Enjoyed my stay. I was appreciate that the staff offered and helped with luggage up the steep steps up to my fourth floor room. For me it was the best balance of cost, value, and location. I will stay there again when I return to Amsterdam.

<Content>THE DI ANN We have just been to this hotel for 2 nights, and didnt expect much. The hotel is small and the stairs are very steep but, the staff are very friendly and helpfull (especially with the bags). Breakfast was very basic ie bread,eggs,cheese and jams etc. There is even a toaster and endless amounts of coffee or tea. For a 2 star it felt like a 3 the way we were treated. If you want a grander hotel with a lift, then go to a more modern one with a price to match, but this one is fine by me.

<Content>Fantastic stairs Just come back from staying ai the Di Ann, fantastic hotel room was great had a view of the Herengracht canal all the way up to the Magna Plaza. Staff were all very friendly and helpful even offered to carry our case up the stairs. Had heard about the staircase in hotel but wasn't till we got there did I believe how steep it really was, Not suitable for anyone with bad knees or vertigo thats for sure. Very enjoyable stay and will definitely be back again.

<Content>Location Location Location..... Excellent 2 star hotel. Very clean, maid service daily with fresh towels and made beds. Friendly staff, very helpful. Small 3 bedded room, lovely shower! Balcony and views of canal. Not much can be said about breakfast, just toast.Good location, 5 mins from Dam Sq. 15 minds from Red Light District, 15 mins from Leidspein. Would definately recommend if your looking for basic central accomodation.

The hotel was very clean and warm and the rooms were lovely! room 310 very big and we had no problems with 4 in the room clean towels every day and they also made the beds! i would definately reccommend this hotel and i would consider visiting again! 5 minute walk to Dam Square and plenty of restaurants and pubs around.

<Content>Small  having stayed at the Di-Ann and managed to get up the extremely narrow  steep staircase, I can safely say our stay was very pleasent. The staff on reception we're very helpful giving us information on places to see, ideally situated for Ann Frank House ( go first thing on a Sunday morning if your hangover will allow). The room was very clean however cramped, but I look upon it that you only need it to sleep in while in Amsterdam your not going to be spending much time in it.If you want a clean and cheap room stay here.

<Content>Perfect for the short stay After spending days searching for a hotel my girlfriend and I finally decided to go for Di - Ann Hotel. The hotel was good value for money, offering a clean room and large en-suite bathroom. We ordered a standard double room but to our surprise managed to land a free upgrade to a balcony room! A basic self service breakfast was served in a nice little dining room offering cereal, toast, muffins, boiled eggs, fruit, juice, tea and coffee, enough to set us up till lunch. The down sides were that the room was on the small side, just enough room for the large double bed in fact! The noise of the trams on the street below could also cause problems if you are a light sleeper. A deposit for the TV remote is required. Be prepared for the large red steep stair case, especially if you have had a few drinks!! These factors did not really affect our stay at all as we did get very good value. No complaints.Di-ann hotel is perfect for the short stay (my girlfirend and I stayed 3 nights in February 2004) and if you looking for somewhere cheap/good value for money. The building is rather attractive with some rooms looking out onto the canals and palace. It is in a fantastic location only 5 minutes minutes walk from the heart of the city, Joordan area, and the redlight. A good location if you want to avoid the immediate busy of the centre or the redlight district.

<Content>Probably the worst hotel in the world The term 'hotel' is misleading - this is no more than a backpacker's hostel, but calls itself a hotel and charges accordingly. Rooms the size of a shoebox, showers that don't drain properly, dodgy electrics, no fire safety notices, frayed towels with bleach stains and holes, 20 euro deposit for TV remote control (which didn't even work), do it yourself breakfast (if you can find any bread to put in the toaster). Need I say more.We checked out after one night and were successful in gaining full refund for unused nights from our travel agent - says it all really, I guess.

<Content>Fabulous Experience!! I've just returned from a trip to Amsterdam and stayed at Di Ann - it was wonderful! The steep, narrow staircase is very charming! Of course the room was small - this is Amsterdam, what do you expect? It was totally clean and comfortable and I highly recommend reserving one with a balcony - we stayed up late many nights to gaze out over Raadhuistraat to watch the trams (which are not loud but do clang as trolleys tend to do), the Royal Palace, Westerkerk and Magna Plaza - a most spectacular view. And Keko the cat is great!! If you stay here, please give her some Nutroma (you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there) for me.

<Content>Mostly good but...... Like other reviews I can confirm that there are some problems associated with staying here. Firstly the hotel. Having read the reviews i expected those stairs but these are typical of Amsterdam. Yes the rooms were small but we found the room adequate and clean. The staff were friendly and we had no problems. The hotel is in a great location near to Dam square and we liked this side of Amsterdam.But ... and a big but, the noise was a problem and sleeping was difficult. Double glazed windows would help. Trams run until around midnight and then start again around 6am. For this reason and this reason only we would not stay here again.

<Content>Very comfortable and reasonable I just returned from a wonderful stay in Amsterdam. As the trip was business on a grant, I really needed to keep costs down, and Di-Ann was very reasonable. The hotel is close to the Dam Square, the Anne Frank House-- and the conference I attended at the Rode Hoed. Di-Ann was an easy walk to anything I wanted to see -- from the train station to the Van Gogh museum. The staff was friendly and helpful, the room was quite small but comfortable and clean-- with shower, balcony, canal view, TV, small refrigerator, and the daily included breakfast included Eggs, bread, cheese, and juice-- much nicer than many of my conference-mates at more expensive places (no eggs!) If you want a convenient, clean, and lower-cost place , Di-Ann is a good choice.

<Content>NEVER EVER EVER STAY HERE!!! Don't ever, ever, ever saty here. Everything is false. The rooms aren't big at ll, their the size of someones kitchen. The most important issues I must share is that THEY ARE THEIVES. My money was kept in the hotel safe which was in my room. Well I thought that it would be safe, but it wasen't. $300.00 dollars was missing out of my wallent on the day that I was leaving. After I had left Amsterdam my credit card was charged 3 times in 3 diffrent months. All adding up to $437.98. Please people for the sake of your money. Don't ever utilize this unprofessional place.
