<Content>Not great I definitely would not recommend this hotel for the following reasonsa) Upon arrival at the hotel we were ignored by the receptionist who was taking a personal phone call, he checked us in whilst all the time chatting away on his mobile. He did not greet us, tell us what room we were in or how to find it. Thankfully, we never encountered him again and the other receptionists were much more helpfulb) Although the room was a good size, clean yet basic it was a connecting room. The rooms had wooden floor boards so we could hear people in the next room walking around and talking...every word! We hardly slept our entire stay because of the noisy couple next door. Need I say more! c) The location of the hotel, although obviously close to the Sagrada Familia, is quite far from the main hub of the city. Apart from the hotel and the lack of sleep, the holiday was fantastic and Barcelona is a wonderful city...I would recommend a visit.

<Content>A few rooms stiflingly hot when they shut down the aircon in the rooms Staff seemed quite friendly and maintained their cool even after midnight when we complained that we couldn't keep ours. There is air conditioning in the rooms,It was explained that by November it is switched off. The hotel website does not mention this. Our room faced ino the building and was stiflingly hot even with the window wide open and the curtains back, yet the daytime temperature had been only 18 Celsius. We got very little sleep. We got a free breakfast and were moved to a much more pleasant room for the remaining three nights where aircon was not needed at all because the windows opened to outside. The hotel was found to be clean and well maintained. We had booked a double room on Lastminute.com Apparently there is only one double on each floor, making only about six out of 84 rooms a double. Our first night was in a twin room, then we got a double. There is no way I could get my standard size laptop into the safe (as stated on the hotel's website), apart from the screen it does not fold up any more! The breakfast, at 11 Euros seems expensive, but is good value if you are hungry because you can eat as much as you want. There are no tea and coffee making facilities available apart from in the air-conditioned dining room at breakfast time, so pack a travel kettle. The minibar has some space for cooling your own food and drink. There is quite a good 'library' with information and two PCs. The neutral rating takes into account our problems on the first night.

<Content>Great hotel - great location We were finding accommodation in Barcelona quite expensive then came across this hotel after almost giving up - not cheap but affordable. The reception was clean and modern and check in was quick and easy. The room, although clean, was a little neglected as there were scuff marks all around the walls but other than that the room was great. There is a lovely rooftop terrace from where you can see the spires of the cathedral - unfortunately we didn't find this until our last night so didn't actually get to use it! Although the hotel has no bar or restaurant facility other than offering a buffet breakfast, the hotel is surrounded by lovely little food outlets and bars. We didn't go for the breakfast at 11 euros as it was much cheaper to eat better outside of the hotel. The nearest metro station is only a 5-10 minute walk away as is the Sagrada Familia cathedral. The staff seemed efficient and knowledgeable (not overly friendly but that's seems usual for Spanish hotels). If I had to think of anything negative it would be that there was no information about the hotel or the area in the room (maybe we would have found the rooftop terrace if there had been) and the lifts were incredibly slow. Overall though a great hotel and great location and we really enjoyed our stay here.

<Content>very nice hotel We stayed at this hotel during our honeymoon and we loved it. It is modern, clean and nicely designed. Rooms are small, but have everything you need. Location is also very good - close to subway and SF cathedral. I would definately recommend the hotel.

<Content>Not again. There is only one reason to stay to this hotel: proximity to the subway. If I knew more about this hotel beforehand, I wouldn't come here.First day : I give the voucher asking for a room with a view in front. She says ok. Going up to see that the room sees to all the inside stairs of the hotel. Also, it was twin and not double (as our agency assured us). I went downstairs to change the room and they gave me a room half the size of the previous. We couldn't turn!!The other days we realized that the staff of the front desk is not very clever. The information about the city etc. we asked for, were not right. She gave to us wrong information about car parking. The highlight was when we wanted to go to Teatre Museum Dali at Figueres (about 150 km away from Barcelona) and we asked the same lady as before, if it was open. After checking to the internet (!!!!!) she says it was open. Thank god we called directly to the museum to realise that it is closed on Mondays. The hotel itself didn't give to us the sense of clean.

<Content>Clean and modern I stayed at this hotel in May 2008 on business. The hotel itself is clean and modern and the check in area is very smart. I started off in room 504 but when I went in, only 1 light actually had a bulb in and the room door wouldn't lock. I went straight back down to the reception and a very helpful man grabbed some light bulbs and a wrench and followed me up to see what we could do. After fixing the lights, he realised that he wasn't going to be able to fix the lock but did point out that no-one could really enter without a keycard. However, I did want a room that locked from the inside so he helped me move my cases up to room 708. I did have to take my towels and pillows from the previous room which did look a bit odd, but we laughed about it in the elevator. He was very apologetic.Both rooms were clean and modern and had air-con. The street is very safe, about a 5 minute walk from the metro. I had a twin room with both beds pushed together. The bathroom had a lovely walk in shower which was bliss. The floors however are wooden, so you can hear people moving about in other rooms. The staff were very nice to me, and booked me taxis for my meetings and were generally nice.

<Content>Decent 3 star hotel My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Sagrada Familia hotel. Our room was clean, staff were friendly, good shower, no problems. We did not try the breakfast buffet feeling it was too expensive at 鈧?1 per person. Safe, residential neighborhood, 5 min from Sagrada Familia church and metro stop. Many small grocery stores around and a good nonsmoking bakery/cafe 2 doors down. If you feel like Chinese food, try Casa Fong on Carrer de Sardenya walking towards the metro station. Short walk from hotel for great food, service and value.

<Content>Unfriendly and unwelcoming Chose this hotel as part of a package offer on easyjet. the hotel is easy to find as it's only about 10 mins walk fr the Metro.When we got to the hotel, the front desk people were not busy at all but it took about 3 minutes for them to finish shuffling papers and looking at which of them two would attend to us. The lady finally gave it and asked me (in spanish) some question to which I replied (in english) that I didn't speak spanish. I gave her the hotel voucher and she asked for my passport as well.She did things very roughly, banging the photocopier cover, shoving her chair aside to make room for her to move about and then dropping her pen and saying something (in spanish) under her breath which thank God I didn;t understand. She shoved me the hotel key and said thats your card. and then she sat down. Im like? errrr- do we have a double bed as requested via booking three weeks ago? she said NO. I said any chance? she said NO. err how about the breakfast we paid for? where is the breakfast room and what time? she said you come down here, 8am. Im like okaay..she must have a bad hair day.when we got up the lift which btw gives you a little jump when it stops, we got to our room which was terribly warm. the website says all rooms are air conditioned but it isn't. i rang reception and the guy said, Madam, in winter what we have is a heater and in the summer if you feel hot, open the window. Okaaay...Thanks a lot.the bathroom had a little dead cockroach, the bedroom flooring was missing two tiles so you can see the foam underneath the flooring and the towels are dirty.Too bad for this place which has as one of its great points, location proximity to Sagrada. I wouldn't stay here again unless all you wanted to see was the Sagrada.

<Content>the location is amazing! We stayed at the Hotel Sagrada Familia in february, it was ok, the location was fantastic right at the heart of Barcelona, reception staff not very friendly, it seemed like a problem that i wanted to pay for the room on arrival instead of departure, I am a manager in a hotel i didnt think it was very good service, i asked for a taxi on departure and the receptionist on desk tutted at me!The room was very modern and clean.although when you took a shower the water came through the floor in the bedroom! there was no greeting when you walked past reception just a stare.Think staff need customer care training. Nice city and good location but i will not be staying there again.

<Content>Good price hotel I suggested this hotel to my parents who were here to visit me for the second time, so they had lived the overcrowded streets and hotels scenario and didn't want to repeat it, and its the least to say that they were very happy with the location, since its in the heart of Barcelona, but still calm and safe enough to live the real Barcelona and mingle with the locals. Very close is the Sagrada Familia and its Avenida Gaudi, which is a lovely street that starts with terraces with a impressive view of the Sagrada Familia and ends with a equally impressive view of The Hospital Sant Pau, a hidden spot of Barcelona which is worth while walking the avenida gaudi just to discover it. For lunch or dinner (since they light up the church at night) its just great to seat at one of the tables of the avenida gaudi restaurant terraces, and then after a couple of glasses of wine, head towards el Barrio de Gracia to find the nontouristy bars or just go back to your room, because it is all walking distance and if going far, the metro is right there as well. I've been in Barcelona for a year now and I personally love the area, but there aren't a lot of hotels in this neighborhood to choose from. My parents were satisfied with my choice and we marked this hotel as a favorite and they would definitely repeat.

<Content>Great hotel at reasonable price We spent 4 nights at the Sagrada Familia at the end of November. The hotel was very clean and our room on floor 5 was a reasonable size with a huge walk in shower. The room had the benefit of a large balcony from which we could see the spires of Sagrada Familia. The buffet breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice of cheeses, meats, pastries, bread and fruit and a selection of teas, coffee, juices and water. The staff were very helpful and provided a map of Barcelona. The instructions to find the hotel on their website is informative and accurate and we had no trouble finding it from the Metro station in the dark. We used the Metro extensively buying a 10 ticket pack. An excellent hotel to which I'd be glad to return and I'd recommend it to anyone. I booked it on Yeego and paid 75 Euros per night for both of us including buffet breakfast.

<Content>Absolutely fine Finding the hotel on exiting Sagrada Familia metro was a bit of a challenge using the hotels directions. Once located, check-in was pleasant and efficient. Hotel is 3 mins from Sagrada Familia. I has faxed the hotel a couple of days ahead of time asking for a quiet room well away from the lifts. They had received my request and allocated me a room accordingly. My rear facing room on floor 4 was modern, very clean and wholly functional. A double bed would have been more comfortable than the two small singles pushed together but hey! Bathroom was roomy with a nice big walk-in shower. Mini-bar was reasonably priced. Only down side was finding a pair of (clean, I think) womens panties and a bandana on top of the spare pillow in the closet - some might find this an added extra but I didn't!!! I didn't bother with the buffet breakfast but instead took breakfast at the very pleasant cafe two door away. Great coffee, pastries and sandwiches with cheery service all for 鈧?. For the 鈧?0 I paid for 1 night, this place was just fine. Would be happy to return and recommend.

<Content>Good location shame about the standard of accomodation While the room was adequate it was badly in need of re-decoration as is the whole hotel. The window would not close due to a broken catch. Poor soundproofing and breakfast, while buffet advertised, no toaster available. Staff were pleasant but building needs attention.

<Content>Great location, nice place to stay My husband and I booked this hotel over the internet. It was a nice place to stay, the room is quite small and the a/c did not work (it was march so it didnt matter) but it was an overall good experience. The hotel restaurant was not working while we stayed there (it was under renovation) so I can't say if it was good or bad. That wasn't really a problem since there are cafeterias everywhere. The location is GREAT especially since it's close to everything but not close enough to be bothered by noise from the streets. The staff was ok, I harldy interacted with them. I would recomend it and stay there again.

<Content>Good value for money The Sagrada Familia has a good location near to the popular church and the Metro. The staff are friendly and helpfull and rooms are clean and wellequipped. But please make sure you dont get a room next to the elevators, as they are very noisy. Breakfast is also good and is served until 10.30 on weekdays and until 11.00 on weekends, which is perfect. All in all a good middleclass hotel just outside the citycentre, which you can reach via Metro in 15 minutes or by taxi at around 7-10 Euro.

<Content>Just O.K. First the positives: The location was good, being literally a couple of blocks from la Sagrada Familia as well as a metro station. Nice to have that stunning work of architecture as the first thing you see each morning as you begin your travels. It was also nice having a small internet business center across the street. The hotel does have a computer in the lobby, but it was always occupied. Security safe in the room was convenient, but I was very surprised that they charged extra for using it.The room was not exactly spotless. Walls were dirty and the blanket was stained. The half-door on the bathtub meant it was impossible to take a shower without soaking the whole room.The gentlemen at the front desk in the evenings were helpful and friendly, but some of the women in the mornings were not so nice. The power went out early one morning so we couldn't see to use the bathroom (it was still dark). When my wife went downstairs for the third time to check on the status of the problem, the front desk attendant snapped at her, saying that she was busy too! Fortunately, the repairman showed up just in time for us to get ready and (barely) make our bus reservations.The hotel was certainly adequate, but I would have expected a bit more for the price.

<Content>Would definitely recommend!! I booked this holiday as a celebration of my mum's 60th and my 30th birthdays. I read loads of reviews on here as I wanted to make sure this holiday was a pleasant experience. We had a little difficulty finding the hotel as we decided to venture onto the metro, and it was dark at the time - we found a very helpful Information point where the staff drew us directions and we found it in no time. The next day, finding our way around in the light was absolutely fine! The hotel was all we could have hoped for, the buffet breakfast was delicious with a wide variery to choose from. The staff were all friendly, especially at the check in desk, and our towels were changed every day even if we didn't request it! Overall the hotel was an excellent base to explore the city from. We didn't spend much time in the room so it didn't really matter what it was like, but it added to the experience. Would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Fine for a weekend break We stayed here for two nights in January and found this modern and clean hotel to be adequate for a city break. The staff were helpful and we were pleasantly surprised that the hotel was one of the few in Barcelona we have stayed at to actually meet our request for a double bed (rather than twin). Our room on the seventh floor was fairly small, but clean, modern and very quiet with a great comfy bed, and equipped with TV (though no sign of the advertised mini-bar). Unfortunately it reeked of (long-term) smoke, despite the no-smoking sign in the room. Like a previous reviewer found, air flow was a problem, the room was hot (even in January) and we kept the windows open 24/7 since our air-con only pumped out hot air. The shower room was large and equipped with basic toiletries, but there were some really unpleasant smells coming from the drains. Breakfast buffet in the morning was fine and included fruit, cereal, cheese, ham, cakes. Location wise, the hotel is only two blocks from the Sagrada Familia metro, to take you into the city centre. Its quite a trek into the city centre on foot, though we enjoyed walking across to Passeig de Gracia and down that way both days. Beware if booking via Hotelopia as, at time of writing, their map puts the hotel 8 blocks closer to the city centre which is very misleading - but obviously this is no reflection on the hotel. Overall, we had some niggles with the hotel (mainly the smells in our bedroom and bathroom!), but for the time spent in our room and the price we paid we could certainly have done worse. I would stay here again, but only if, as on this occasion, they were offering a better deal than some of the great 4-star hotels in the Sarria district.

<Content>Very nice hotel! A very nice hotel and a great location. Easy to get around and walking distance to the Sagrada Familia and easy access to the subway. The room was nice and comfortable but my only complaint was air flow was not very good so it would get a little warm even on cool days. The staff was friendly and helpful. A computer is available in the lobby for checking email. We did not have breakfast at the hotel but there are many places around and including many little shops. I would stay again!

<Content>Sagrada Familia Hotel perfect for pre-cruise We booked the Hotel Sagrada Familia for 1 night pre-cruise and absolutely loved it. Yes, it's a little removed from Placa Catalunya but with the metro, getting around was a breeze. There are good restaurants on Avenue Gaudi and we wish we had booked it for our 3 nights post-cruise instead of small apartment in Barri Gotic. Anyone staying here will not be sorry. The only downside was us wanting to check in early and we had to wait until almost 3 p.m. after a long overnight flight from U.S.

<Content>A great find This little hotel was an absolute find. It was built in 2004 and the rooms are fresh, clean, quiet and totally adequate for a city break. The bathrooms are well equipped with shower, bath, toilet and basin along with basic toiletries and a hairdryer. TV and air conditioning too. Breakfast is buffet style but with plenty of choice. Location wise the hotel is around 2 mins walk from the Gaudi's Sagrada Familia which has a metro right next door. I would thoroughly recommend getting a 2 day tourist bus pass that takes you to all the tourist attractions within and slightly outside the main city area. If you are staying in the city for the day after checking out of the hotel, just ask the reception staff to hold your bags and they will lock them away in a cupboard for you to collect later.All in all I would thoroughly recommend and definitely go back when I next visit the city. A definite thumbs up!

<Content>Nice Hotel My gf and i stayed at this hotel for 5nights, i didnt expect much from it at all but it was a very nice hotel, very very clean and modern hotel, the rooms were quite small with no balcony so dont expect a large room. The reception staff spoke little english however they were very friendly and tried to help the best they could. It was quite a way out of the main city centre but about a 2min walk from the famous gaudi cathedral. There is a metro station next to the cathedral where you can get anywhere in the city from and i recomment getting a pass, i got a 5day pass which was 20euros and we used to get to the cental areas, the zoo the neu camp, olymipic village, airport etc. There were a couple of bars and places to eat around the hotel tho very limited there were a few fast food places and a supermarket. I would recomend this to any budget traveller and anyone wanting a short break in the city and great holiday very recomended.Feel free to email me if you need to know anything else.
