<Content>I Would Stay in Alam Shanti Anytime!.. Love it My friend and I stayed there for 2 nights because the 3rd night was full 31st Dec 07 to 02nd Jan 08. I love Alam Shanti. The location is great, one can walk about 10mins north of the village, pass some rice fields, pass the Monkey Forest (the fringe of it) and arrive at the southern end of Ubud. For me Ubud holiday stay, I must stay in Alam Shanti. The sister hotel Alam Indah is also nice--my cup of tea--if one is into villa type of stay, minus the typical Marriott / Shangri-la type of frills. Just sharing my thoughts.

<Content>Can not say enough good things about Alam Shanti Having just returned from our weekend at Alam Shanti I can not say enough good things about staying here. We arrived late in the evening and had arranged for them to meet us at the airport. When we arrived the office had closed and we were shown straight to our room. We sorted out registratiion the next morning.We had Yamuna and WOW. It was so nice and homey and we loved our HUGE balcony with 2 day beds. The perfect place to lounge with a book and watch the rice grow in the rice paddy. The gardens were beautiful and the pool stunning. Breakfast was delivered to our balcony each morning with a smile. Tthe staff were lovely and nothing was too much trouble. Two day we walked into Ubud and when we were tired we had the cafe call and got them to come collect us. They would drop us off and pick us up from dinner with just a call.The perfect place for a peaceful getaway with a friend which is what we wanted. Will definitely go back again.Our only complaint was all the rooms were full as we would have loved to have looked at them all. I'd say I'd love to book another room next time but I suspect I will take Yamuna again since I loved it so much.

<Content>Go there if you can! You will not regret it! Alam Shanti is a unique jewel at the edge of Ubud, in the middle of nature, calm and peaceful. It's a resort of about 10 villas, in the middle of a gorgeous tropical garden, including a nice, pittoresque and absolutely clean swimming pool.Please do neither expect animation, 24/7 entertainment, American style all-inclusive buffet, passing out people etc. - for this, go to Kuta or Sanur, or better stay out of Bali. Alam Shanti is for people who seek peace, beauty, gorgeous nature, amazing smells and just a perfect relaxation. Check Alam Shantis homepage (alamindahbali dot com) - it gives you a first impression.My wife and I went there on our honeymoon in May, 2008 - and it was JUST PERFECT!Reservation is done directly by phone or email: Alam Shanti (and its sister resorts) is family-run and - for Gods sake - cannot be booked with big travel agencies. Many guests come again and again, so booking in advance is adviseable.ACCOMODATIONYou will usually get a sort of villa for your own: my wife and I stayed in the Yamuna villa whose veranda alone is bigger than a standard hotel room. As soon as you get there, you are captured by the charme of the place: relax in the daybed on the veranda while hearing the warm morning rain (no worries: lasts about 30 Minutes only) dripping onto your thick banana leaf roof and the jungle next-door, and you will feel a peace you haven't felt in your life. Listen to the animals in the near jungle, or take a bath in the huge bathtub in the open-space bathroom - the shower is a man-high stone statue.FOOD:Each morning, after your request (call whenever you wake up), a staff member will bring you your breakfast to the veranda: fresh fruit, eggs, toast, coffee, tee - it is really great.For dinner you just have to walk outside the resort: just before the entrance of Alam Shanti and Alam Wangi, there is a delicious Balinese restaurant just waiting for guests to come in. You might be the only guests, you might taste the most yummy dishes you can imagine, and at the end of the meal you will pay, including drinks and dessert, maybe 5 to 7 US$.SERVICE:Excellent!!! You're treated like a king. Call, and they will take you to town. Take a card of the resort and give it to a waiter in case you have dinner in town, and someone's gonna pick you up and drive you home. Believe me: it's great!MASSAGES:Next to Alam Shanti is Alam Wangi - if you don't use it you're stupid: they offer great massages, full-body massages, Ayuverda massages, oil massages, etc etc for ridiculous prices. One hour costs around 15 US$ - take advantage as much as you can!!!TRIPS:You can have trips organized by the staff, or you can rent a scooter or hire a driver, or you can just walk 5 minutes to the monkey forest. The good thing is: you are in the middle of gorgeous nature, but Ubud is just a 5-minute drive away.RESUMEE:Guys, believe me. I searched for weeks in Internet to find a suitable place for our honeymoon, and I must say choosing Alam Shanti was the BEST choice! After having been there, i can guarantee you that you might not find anything better, and even more for this price! Of course, there are lots of beautiful places, hotels, resorts on Bali. Maybe another resort has a bigger pool. Maybe another hotel is 300 Meters closer to town. Maybe another hotel is at the sea with a nice beach - ANYWAYS: the Alam Shanti is THE BEST i could imagine, and honestly I would not change it for any 6-star-resort. The peace, the charme, the originality you find there is just unique.FINAL TIP:Take one of the big villas (we took Yamuna). I just saw that Alam Shanti is going to raise their prices, so that the two big villas will cost 150 US$ per night from 01/2009 on. Still, only four words: IT IS WORTH IT !!!

<Content>beautiful beautiful alam shanti! My husband and I stayed at the Alam Shanti for six nights last week.This Hotel was everything I had hoped for and more.The grounds were beautiful with lily ponds and small water fountains dotted throughout. It was so private, and we hardly noticed anyone else there. We had the lovely pool to ourselves most of the time. Breakfast was good and every afternoon between 3.00p.m. and 6.00p.m. you could call for your afternoon tea and it would be delivered to wherever in the grounds you wanted it. We looked forward to seeing what yummy treat we would get as each day it was something different, and very yummy it was. The rest of the day tea and coffee was available on request as the rooms have no tea/coffee making facilities.Our room was the Indus. I could not believe how large it was! Just beautiful. We had a large balcony and every evening we sat outside listening to the myriad of the calls of the night. The shuttle was available anytime to take us to Ubud which is only a 10 minute walk through the monkey forest but longer by road.The staff deserve special mention. They were unfailingly friendly attentive and just genuinely lovely. Nothing was too much trouble and we had a late check out pre-arranged with no extra cost.We felt as though we were in paradise.This Hotel is perfect for those wishing to spend a few nights of serenity and would be wonderful for a honeymoon!!

<Content>Peaceful stay My wife  I stayed at the Alam Shanti in August 2008 as part of a 3 place holiday stay in Bali.After making our decision through Tripadvisor review information we realised we had hit the jackpot with this choice.I was a little worried though because I am the type that gets itchy feet and wants to go off exploring, too much time relaxing bores me but my wife likes peace and serenity and can spend most of her time relaxing, reading doing puzzle books etc.We stayed in the Shindu room and it surpassed our expectations. This room is huge, ( no T.V. ) the bathroom is very good and the bed is massive and comfortable. The hotel staff keep everything very clean.The gardens, pool ( very cold Brrrrr! ) are magnificent.The staff are friendly and helpful.The Spa too is very good and reasonably priced.If there could be any fault I found the breakfast not to be substantial enough but my wife disagrees.There is a free shuttle bus to take you into central Ubud just ask at reception and they will organise it straight away and if you go to the Cafe Wayan they will organise a lift back.We enjoyed our stay here and can understand why it has such good reviews.

<Content>never again When we first looked at the Alam Shanti on the internet, it looked great, and a real chance to experience Balinese cultures first hand. In fact I loved it when we were first shown our room.We stayed in the Gangaa room, the largest suite, and at first the intricate Balinese beds and beautiful views off the balcony looked impressive. But on further examination of one of the beds, there was a stain on one of the mosquito nets that looked very much like blood, and the day beds were dirty.Going into the open air bathroom, and what at first looked like two fun looking outdoor showers later turned out to be a hosepipe through a stone statue, and there was a cigarette butt on the ledge next to the other one. Also the sanitary bin had not been emptied for two days.The infinity pool overlooked gorgeous wildlife and rice terraces, but the basin at the side of the pool, to collect the overflowing water, was filthy and probably had never been cleaned out. I was also not the only living creature in the pool at many occasions; looking around I saw many alive bugs and insects in the pool; something which a simple cleaning once or twice a day would have looked after.The staff were very friendly, although what i feel let the place down most was the fact that there was no on site restaurant. Consequently I did not enjoy my limited choice of breakfast foods. However, on a good note, i would like to reccomend a small restaurant just down the road from the Alam Shanti called Laka Leke; here we ate every night and even took a Balinese cooking class. Laka Leke was a nice escape from the Alam Shanti, but it still retained it's Balinese features, in a cleaner fashion.

<Content>Peaceful paradise We have just returned from a 2 night break at Alam Shanti as part of a 3 stay holiday (staying at The Shangri La, Bangkok and The Jimbaran Bali Villas, Jimbaran Bay, Bali).Alam Shanti is an absolutely amazing place. We stayed in Indus room which was huge with lovely views. There is a lovely pool with infinity edge and breakfast can be served on your private terrace which was an absolute bonus.Ubud is a lovely place and is a refuge away from Kuta (which although great can get quite busy!). We definately recommend these restaurants in Ubud: Lamak, Three Monkeys and Lotus Cafe (on Monkey Forest Road).Alam Shanti is also very close to the Sacred Monkey Forest which is lovely (there is a motorbike path which you can walk along to get into Ubud which means you dont have to pay entry into the forest). The walk into Ubud is very quick and there is also a free shuttle service from Alam Shanti to and from Ubud (until 10pm). A few of the bars have jazz or bands on in the eveningThe staff were very friendly and would help you with anything you needed and we would definately recommend Alam Shanti

<Content>Bargain Price It is hard to write a bad word about Alam Shanti. Firstly, just read the reviews to see their loyal following. Secondly, the staff are so so lovely. Lastly, they are cheap and you really do get your money's worth.The reception is very peaceful, with great chairs to lounge in. The gardens are well maintained and very pretty. The pool is a bit of a stunner for the price you are paying. The rooms are big, the bathrooms gorgeous.So, what could be wrong. Well, nothing at this price but there are a few points worth noting.Firstly, although the rooms where overall very clean there were a lot of stains on the daybed throws and pillows. I would have loved to have spent hours lounging with a book and drink but hesitated. The bathroom towels were clean but blackened from the water they are washed in. I know this is just a result of local conditions, so why not buy black towels and forget the problem!Secondly, the food. Breakfast was perfectly Balinese and the Black Rice Pudding worth it everytime. I am pretty sure the staff play a big role in the breakfast prep but every other meal is brought from a nearby restaurant (same owners). I am not fussy and would definately try to stick to Balinese food whilst in Bali but have to say the meals where very average. Solution, eat out, but with a baby we were stuck a few time not being able to do this.The staff are fantastic and after 20 or more years of visiting Bali I am relieved that there is still some authentic accomodation available. For this price, I would suggest a stay at Alam Shanti. It won't cost you much, luxury is available on a small scale, the day spa is dirt cheap but still as good as the bigger resorts (if not better) and you really will be able to feel like you have been to Bali.

<Content>|Little paradise For me staying in this little palace was the highlight of my stay in Bali. It was marvellous, the surrounding was awesome. I took my mum with me and she loved it. I stayed in Dewi, Shindu and Ganga, just to experience what each room is like and I wasn鈥檛 disappointed. The view from the rooms looking over the gorgeous garden and the rice field was beyond anything words could describe. Though I have to say the best room for me was Dewi room. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. I loved the breakfast, it was fit for a king. When I visit Bali again, I will definitely stay there again and it鈥檚 definitely good value for money.

<Content>Too Beautiful For Words! We just returned from our vacation in Bali and part of our trip was spent at the Alam Shanti in Ubud. If you would like to experience a little bit of Heaven on Earth, then my advice is to book a room at this hotel. Actually, the rooms are more like little bungalows set amidst the exquisite landscape of Ubud. You are literally swept away in a nature wonderland of sorts where the sounds of birds, frogs, gecko's, chickens, and all types of insects will lull you to sleep and literally be nature's alarm clock for you in the morning when it's time to wake up.Due to availability, we had the chance to stay in three different bungalows during our stay at Alam Shanti (Saraswati, Dewi, and Laksmi rooms). All I can say is, WOW! the rooms are all gorgeous with marble bathrooms, beautiful and comfortable beds, and views that are simply amazing. I'd recommend getting a 2nd floor room if possible because like I said, the views are amazing. The 2nd floors all have a terrace or balcony of some sort, usually with a nice big daybed and table and chairs where you can enjoy your morning breakfast which is served in your room. Of the 3 rooms we stayed in, Laksmi was the only one on the first floor but it too was pretty gorgeous (the first floors have a very huge porch area--also quite lovely). Not only were the rooms quite impressive, but I have to say that the staff at Alam Shanti were quite exceptional. Saying that they were friendly is only half of it. The staff, from reception to housekeeping, to the drivers, went above and beyond their call of duty, in my opinion. They were always ready and eager to assist with anything we needed, from helping with transportation, to ordering room service from the local restaurant, to just being so warm and wonderful to all their customers.We LOVED this place and hope to return in the future.Thank-you Alam Shanti for helping to make our vacation so fantastic!

<Content>Paradise!!!! I went to Ubud solo for my 40th birthday. I booked 4 nights at Alam Shanti and 2 nights at Komaneka Tanggayuda. I booked my stay at Alam Shanti based off the plethora of positive reviews on Trip Advisor and it totally exceeded my expectations. Even though the reviews were so positive I guess I could not believe it would be so amazing for the price. That is why I also booked 2 nights at Komaneka for $250 per night. When I arrived at Alam Shanti and spent sometime there I was beginning to wonder how anythign could be more beautiful. I was serioulsy wondering why I booked at such a higher rate. Well they are two different vibes and both places are totally worth it. but if you are on more of a budget then you will do just fine to be at Alam Shanti. But if you want to splurge a bit, Komaneka Tanggayuda is amazing and also a bargain at $250.Alam Shanti truely is the most beautiful place. My objective on this vacation was to do absolutley nothing. I usually travel to the middle east, so lets just say my vacations are usually jam packed and very eventful. I thought I would take a real vacation and Ubud is definately the place to do it. The great thing about Ubud is there are so many activities to partake in if you choose and if u just want to relax it is perfect for that as well.I have stayed at several four seasons resorts and many other high end boutique hotels and I was beyond satisified with Alam Shanti, espeically for the price. My room was upstairs (dewi) and was HUGE! Huge gorgeous bathroom and huge terrace with table and chairs and wonderful day bed. Seriously, i would just lay on my daybed for hours and stair at the rice fields or watch birds and butterflies and listen to the birds and insects and read. it was divine! Usually around 11 or so i would head to the pool. During my whole stay I never saw another person at the pool. I had a gorgeous infinity pool all to myself. at the end of the infinity pool is gorgeous jungle with some landscaping with lotus ponds, a stream and just tons of trees, flowers and butterflies. I would just rest at the end of the pool and watch the butterflies, birds and squirrels. so relaxing. Every minute I would think I was seeing the most beautiful sight and then 5 minutes later i woudl see something even more stunning.All the grounds are beautiflly landscaped with shrines, lotus ponds etc. It is so peaceful and serene. The staff is very nice and accomodating. The Spa treatements and massage were great and so inexpensive. I mean, its not at the level of the four seasons, but for the price it is superb. The massage itself was amazing. loved the technique, but u dont have the level of sophistication of a four seasons if that is what you are looking for. oh only bad thing about spa is that it is located on the drive that takes u into the hotel compound. Meaning, u hear a lot of noisy cars/mopeds while u r getting massage.Personally for Ubud this was exactly what I was looking for more so than a high end chain hotel. This was cozy, quaint, quiet, peaceful gorgeous with huge room. I also like the fact that it is owned by Balinese rather than foreign chain.They are also really great abotu taking you into town and the surrounding areas and picking you up for no extra charge.I highly recommend this hotel and will definatley go back!

<Content>beautiful place, serene we loved this place. We stayed in Ubud, Sembarentang, and in Jimbaran Bay. I would skip Jimbaran and stay in Ubud. There are great cultural experiences to be had. The hotel will book them for you. The food was good, the rooms were great. Had a great rice patty tour, and it rained cats and dogs the entire time! Still, it was fantastic.

<Content>A magical place!! Just returned from Alam Shanti and Alam Giwa their sister property next door. Both were magical places which embodied my vision of Bali. Stayed on the rice paddie replete with Oxen, ducks, monitor lizards, gekos and a myriqad of sights and smells. the hotel had a centries old feel and design yet is 3! New spa was great with daily $20 1.5 hour massages from qualified technicians. Breakfast crepes were killer and the staff arranged all tours, transpo and my picky needs with ease..... Go stay there ASAP!!!!

<Content>Wow!! This place was just amazing. Alam Shanti has 8 rooms (ranging in price) so I'd recommend to book early. I stayed for three nights. One night in the Narmada room, and the following two nights upstairs in Indus. Both rooms were lovely, with four poster bed and marble (huge!) bathrooms. The upstairs room has a balcony with daybed, and the downstairs room a huge verhandah. The pool area was nice, clean, quiet and overlooked a nearby creek and rice field. I can also recommend the spa at the property, they did nice massage, facial, pedicure and manicure. As a couple of reviews mention you are living close with nature. That means the occasional bug or cicak (house gecko) coming inside to pay a visit - they do no harm and add to the ambience of the place. My room did occasionaly get a bit smokey courtesy of the neighbouring farmers maintaining their rice paddly fields and burning off. A simple fix for this is just to close the windows when they light up.It is a nice walk into Ubud via the sacred Monkey Forest, the hotel also has a free shuttle service if you're feeling too lazy (or hot) to walk.

<Content>Wonderful! I booked Alam Shanti on the basis of Tripadvisor reviews, and it certainly lived up to expectations! It's simply gorgeous - spacious most beautiful gardens and a most wonderful pool area. I was traveling solo, so I had one of the cheaper rooms (one of only 8) which was excellent value - huge with spacious outdoor areas but a little noisy as it's closest to the little laneway and entrance. When I return (which I definitely will!) I would book one of the more expensive rooms which I still think would be excellent value. The staff are lovely and the breakfasts were fantastic. It's a little out of the way but an easy walk to into Ubud during the day and very willing transport provided as well.

<Content>What a find! We just returned from a week's stay in Alam Shanti. The review title is a bit misleading because we didn't really find it - we booked based largely on the reviews here on Trip Advisor, and we weren't disappointed.We opted to pay a little more and stayed in Yamuna which is the middle level of the villa overlooking the rice fields and within easy reach of the pool. I didn't look at the other rooms, but I have to say I was very impressed with the size, decor and level of comfort provided at Alam Shanti. I can honestly say I don't think I have slept as well as I did for a very long time.Staying at Alam Shanti feels very close to nature, and my only piece of advice to would-be visitors would be to be prepared for insect life and geckos to come very close. I was woken one night by a gecko that sounded like it was next to me in bed! If you can handle ants, mosquitoes, and geckos you will find this place fantastic.When we first arrived at Alam Shanti, because of the route taken from the airport, it felt as though the hotel was quite a long way from the main centre of activity in Ubud. In actual fact, we discovered that it's just a short walk through Monkey Forest to the main strip. Even so, if you're feeling a bit lazy, they lay on a shuttle service to pretty much anywhere in Ubud. If you're feeling lazy after doing a spot of shopping, you can call to be picked up wherever you are - or you can wander to Cafe Wayan (amazing spaghetti carbonara by the way) for a lift home. I think these touches make all the difference - there seems a genuine desire to give guests a truly relaxing experience.Breakfast was delivered to our room each day and really the only complaint was that the toast was too hard. Everything else was great, including the coffee which has a real kick to it as you might expect being in Bali.For the price, I really don't think you can go wrong with Alam Shanti. I only hope the success doesn't lead to complacency and the standards dropping. We really felt lucky to have found Alam Shanti and I would definitely recommend it for anyone needing a lazy few days in Ubud and a good night's sleep!

<Content>A great, if not one of the best hotels ever Not entirely sure what sets this hotel apart from the others.There is an indescribable vibe about Alam Shanti, that is hard to encapsulate in mere words. Needless to say it is very popular,so book well ahead.Loved this place so much we have already booked for next year; I must say that after many trips to Bali spanning 25 years, Alam Shanti has rekindled my love affair with this magical island.

<Content>A lovely place to stay My husband and I stayed at the Alam Shanthi for about 5 days in July 2007. We went there for our honeymoon. To summarize very briefly, we had a lovely experience from start to finish. The hotel is beautiful, clean, peaceful and romantic.The Basics:The hotel arranged for a pick-up from the airport, the service was timely and courteous, and it cost us $20 one-way. The drive to the hotel from the airport is about 1 hour. The hotel itself is ensconced at the end of a small lane surrounded by beautiful, lush greenery, 10 minutes walk to the rear entrance of the Monkey Forest. We were received with a refreshing welcome fruit drink and cheerful smiles. The hotel lobby is actually an outdoor patio with a room for an office. There are a few bookshelves with nice books to read and umbrellas to borrow when you go out. The hotel has a free shuttle service to central Ubud 鈥?a reliable, free and friendly service. It takes 15 minutes to go to Ubud 鈥?lots of restaurants to eat there. You won鈥檛 go hungry, ever.The Rooms:We split our stay there into a 3 day stint followed by a break to another Bali city and back for a 2 day stint. The first time we stayed at Dewi and the second time at Sindhu. One upstairs and one downstairs. The only difference between the two rooms is that the downstairs unit (Sindhu) has an open bathroom. Not to worry, there is a closed bath-tub too. Both units have a huge balcony/verandah and look out to a lush green garden, a small paddy field and a small lotus pond. The Sindhu has a small outdoor area in the rear, enclosing the open bathroom, covered by high walls that offer privacy. Both rooms were big, furnished with a four poster king bed. There is a day bed in the balcony to enjoy the fresh crisp air. The d茅cor of the rooms was simple and elegant, with Balinese touches, amply showcasing the local's love of art in every possible way. For instance, stonework on the doorway arches, beautiful woodwork on the clothes-drying-stand and even on a door knob. The rooms had huge windows everywhere giving the space a wide, open feel. The bathroom comes with a huge closet and vanity area to put all your stuff away from plain sight. The bathrooms are clean and the room boasts of overall good hygiene.The Breakfast:Breakfast is free. They have a simple but good selection of items 鈥?bread, omelets, thin pancakes; Fresh fruit and fresh fruit juice; coffee/tea. There is enough to give the discerning vegetarian a hearty meal. Oh, breakfast is served in your room or your balcony. We preferred enjoying it on the balcony, savoring the morning rays and distant chirping of birds. A pity we had to go out sightseeing! The hotel does arrange for lunch and dinner service from a nearby restaurant 鈥?though expensive, you do have something to fall back on, if your dinner plans fail.The pool:The pool is clean and good to look at. We didn鈥檛 use it as we didn鈥檛 have the time and it also rained a bit.The Mosquitoes and the Geckos:Living so close to nature also means that there will be Mosquitoes in your room and the faint sounds of the Gecko鈥檚 adorning the darkness of the nights. The hotel provides a mosquito coil and a net over the bed to keep you safe. Feel free to bring your own insect repellant and ear-buds if you are not ok with these. Please do not let such trifling issues come in the way of lovely Bali.The Service:The service was very good. We were always greeted cheerfully and our requests were taken care of in a timely manner. We had some hot water issues, but it was attended to.Conclusion:My husband and I loved it! We have never had such a relaxing time before. We wanted Alam Shanthi to wash away all the stress and din that comes with planning and executing a wedding. And boy! It did so in style.

<Content>we loved Alam Shanti I wasn't going to write a review, as all the wonderful reviews on here told our story, and shared our thoughts, but when I read a previous negative review I felt the need to tell our experience. We stayed here with our two young children and we all loved it, the walk into Ubud through the monkey forest was a highlight of our trip and our 9 year old daughter wanted to do it over and over again. Our room was spotless, the bathroom was so clean that I actually let the kids have a bath, something I would never normally let them do when travelling. The sheets were clean and the towels were thick and fluffy, the pool was crystal clear, breakfast was lush, and as others have said , room, what room ?, it was more like a peace of heaven!

<Content>A delightful and serene hotel My husband and I spent four nights in the Gangga room at Alam Shanti in late September. We were absolutely delighted with the room, the hotel鈥檚 peaceful location, the lovely gardens and the friendly and gracious staff. The Gangga room was gorgeous and the spacious and beautifully furnished verandah with its view of coconut palms and rice fields was amazing. We did not encounter any of the service problems noted by a recent poster who stayed in the same room. All of our breakfasts were delicious. I was particularly fond of the banana pancake which was actually a crepe with thinly sliced bananas and freshly grated coconut. We also enjoyed complementary afternoon tea and cake on our verandah each afternoon and used Alam Shanti's complementary transportation back to our hotel every evening after walking through the Monkey Forest to dinner in Ubud.Given its many assets and its modest room rates we think Alam Shanti is a world class bargain and recommend it without hesitation to anyone looking for a unique hotel with a true Balinese flavor.

<Content>No! No! No! I thought I would just have to write a review of this hotel to offer an 'alternative' view so as to hopefully prevent others from making the same mistake we did in booking a room here.I booked a rice paddy view room (Gangga) for a short stay in Ubud after reading all the fabulous reviews on this website. I realised that it was 'ultra cheap' but thought that this was simply due to the fact that it was a small, privately owned place - and their website looked beautiful. We love Bali  were looking forward to another great holiday.After a nice relaxing stay on the coast we transfered to Ubud and got our first sighting of the Alam Shanti. Yes the grounds are lovely and well tended and the 'villas' look delightful but thats where the 'georgeousness' stops! The bedding was tired and grey and so were the towels (which incidently are extremely small and thin). The mosquito nets around the beds were far from clean (one had what looked remarkably like a blood stain on it) and the bathroom curtains had black mould growing on them. There was an old cigarette butt in the outside shower area which remained for the 3 days that we were there and the 'sanitary' bin in the bathroom wasn't emptied until I deliberately left it open! Yes, there were lots of flowers placed around around the bedroom and bathroom but what is the point of spending time doing that if basic cleaning is neglected?? As for breakfast, I'm sorry but I just don't understand how people can rave about this - mostly inedible - meal. On our first morning we ordered just about everything between us but by our third  last morning we were down to one or two items ( we even left that). My daughter ordered fresh orange juice one morning only to receive very bright orange squash! The event that put the icing on the cake happened on our last morning when our breakfast was delivered and the young girl dropped the chilli sauce bottle on the mat on the floor of the balcony - it sprayed sauce everywhere but she just picked it up, put it on our table, smiled and left us to it!!! Really sorry folks but this is NOT paradise - we have stayed all over the world in small, medium  large properties  believe me, on the whole, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR  this is a classic example. Remember, it is very cheap so if you want a 'rustic' balinese homestead experience with lovely gardens and don't mind dirty bathrooms, mould, grubby bedrooms, aweful breakfasts etc then this will be for you. (By the way - we did like the restaurant close by - also owned by members of the family - seemed to be on a different wavelength in terms of cleanliness, service and quality of food. Can also recommend their cooking class - really good.)

<Content>Peace , charm and comfort ... bliss !!! We have just returned from our trip to Bali ... our 12th visit over a twenty year period and were charmed by Alam Shanti.We had four nights in the ' Shindu ' Room which is on the ground floor with a beautiful expansive verrandah complete with marble top dining table and relaxing day bed.Many travellers have paid tribute to Alam Shanti and we would like to add to that praise.A wonderful location, stunning gardens and just far enough out of Ubud to give you a sense of peace and seclusion.I think what completed the holiday for us was that the hotel were so good at taking us into Ubud to eat or shop and bring us back when we rang them up to 10.30pm at night with no hestitation at all... this was for no charge at all.Added to this the breakfast served on our verandah was fresh and plenty of it !!!The owners of Alam Shanti also have a lovely restaurant which is not part of the hotel about a five min walk away ... dont miss it... we discoverd it on the last night and wish we had found it earlier as the setting is beautiful and the food very reasonably priced.Dont miss this special gem ... you wont regret it !!!

<Content>Like a palace This is really a gem, very quiet and hidden away in the rice fields.The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms are located in separate houses, with plenty of privacy. They are extremely spacious and well furnished. The bathroom accommodation is luxurious. We stayed three nights in a superiour and one night in a deluxe room, and both were excellent, with a very spacious and secluded terrace.Breakfast was delicious, with a wide choice.The hotel offers free transport to the village of Ubud. Nice swimming pool. The hotel has no restaurant, but you order from a menu from a nearby restaurant and they bring it to your room/terrace.We had an excellent stay in Ubud, also thanks to our friendly guide and driver Putu Nastra. He used to be an official tour guide and knows all the interesting places and history and if you need something specifically, he makes sure you get it, at a good price. Putu speaks English, Spanish and Japanese and he can also arrange rafting excursions etc..., a nice person you can trust. Our 7-year old son got along very well with him. He drives safely and has a comfortable van.His contact details: [--], mob no: [--].

<Content>Felt like the real deal My husband and i stayed at the Alam Shanti for 2 nights. Due to theirpopularity, we had to stay in 2 different rooms. On our first night we stayed in the Laksmi Room ($50) and on our second night we stayed in the Gangga Room ($125). And yes, there is a huge difference between the two rooms insofar as space, views and furnishings. The Laksmi is one of the downstairs rooms. It is definately good value. It is modest, but very clean and comfortable. A good size too:with a double bed and large single bed and great size bathroom. The only minor things would be a lick of paint to freshen it up, and a proper shower, rather than the hand held nozzel. On the plus side, they have a multi-country adaptor, which was very useful for recharging phones and cameras, and using my own hairdryer. You also get quite a bit of noise in this room from the wildlife outside (Cicada's and frogs at night, and roosters in the early hours of the morning). The Gangga room is one of the upstairs rooms. It's nothing short of gorgeous. Its huge, at least double the size of the Laksmi and superbly decorated in authentic Balinese furnishings. There is one queen size bed and a double bed inside, as well as a lovely day bed on the huge balcony. The carving detail in the wood inside and the stone outside is tremendous and the view over the rice paddy fields is just stunning. The bathroom is also wonderful and open air too. There are two (normal) showers, one at each end, as well as a lovely bathtub. The way it has been done, you can have a shower overlooking the rice paddy fields as the wall comes up to your chest. The tiles and natural stone are lovely and far outshine the more boring and worn tiles of the Laksmi bathroom. Unlike the Laksmi, there is also a fridge and full tea and coffee making facilities. The Gangga is also right next to the lovely swimming pool. There is very little noise from this room. We heard no roosters and the frogs/cicadas seemed in the distance.The location of the Alam Shanti is good, depending on what you're looking for. Its quite rural and secluded. During the daytime its a really lovely walk through the monkey forest to the vibrant Monkey Forest Road, and from there quite a long uphill walk of about 20 minutes to the town centre. However, as others have said, they do provide a free shuttle to and from the town centre of Ubud. That service finishes at 10.30pm. At night it's almost impossible to walk to the hotel from town, although cheap transport is readily available.The beakfasts were nice and had quite healthy options too. Although we did get off milk one morning which was pretty disgusting. The service was pretty good. The male staff certainly seemed alot more friendly than the female staff. There was a slight air of ego and preteniousness given off by a couple of the women who sat behind the front desk and their ever polished tripadvisor.com 2006 award. But all in all they were fine.Would certainly consider staying again.

<Content>Enchanting Alam Shanti Fabulous stay at Alam Shanti--our room Nermada had a large, beautiful walled in garden, its own small temple with offerings and incense puja placed by the staff twice a day, a huge roofed veranda with sofa and artwork, large bedroom, dressing room, bathroom and walled shower with 12-15 foot ceilings and gurgling statues in the wall behind, a pleasant staff, a refreshing infinity pool looking into jungle and distance rice fields. The walk into town through the monkey forest was a fun plus. The staff provided car drop-off and pickups whenever called, which is very helpful in the sprawled out village of Ubud. They have a fairly new spa my wife enjoyed. The breakfasts were great with banana pancakes and fresh juices. I would say all this for $95 a night is one of the hotel bargains of the world, particularly since the whole atmosphere is graceful, aesthetic, peaceful Bali at its best.

<Content>A delightful hotel I spent 2 weeks at the Alam Shanti in June/July on my 6th trip to Bali. Although I stayed in one of the standard rooms, Saraswati, it was clean, comfortable, spacious, and had everything I needed. Water pressure was dodgy in the shower, but this is fairly common, and probably worse in upstairs rooms. The gardens are beautiful, and it's worth booking an upstairs room so you can lie on the day bed and look over the trees and flowers to Mt Agung. The staff are caring and considerate and do everything they can to make your stay a pleasant one. The real bonus is to have a car 'on call' for whenever you want to go in to Ubud, or be picked up after shopping or eating in town. It's an easy walk to Ubud beside the Monkey Forest, but when you reach Monkey Forest Road it's a bit of a slog and I'd recommend going via Jalan Hanoman. There's no restaurant at Alam Shanti but you can order food to be delivered from restaurants, and there is always the car to drop you and pick you up from any restaurant in Ubud. After six trips to Bali, and staying in a wide range of accommodation, I feel that Alam Shanti combines the best elements of a Bali experience - natural beauty, gentle people and a serene atmosphere. And there's the lovely pool to enjoy if the tropical heat is too much!

<Content>Alam Shanti- Tiny Paradise in Ubud alam shanti in ubud: a little slice of paradise as everyone says. the atmosphereis serene, staff is gracious and attentive, the grounds are lovingly kept. awonderful attraction is the small pool, with infinity edge into terraced lilyponds and a little gorge. very beautiful and sublime -- you practically have itto yourself as alam shanti only has 6 or 8 rooms. our room was saraswati, $50plus tax, breakfast incl., booked directly through the hotel. it's the lowestpriced room, but quite large, with a very very spacious veranda (which we didn'thave much time to hang out in but appreciated for our breakfasts there; we alsoate once by the pool). whatever grade of room you choose, opt for the upperfloor, more privacy, and usually a larger balcony. the bathroom is also verylarge, with huge sunken marble bath with handheld shower. i can see why theyhave such a loyal clientele, the place has a wonderful vibe to it. a fewcaveats: we had a blackout for a couple minutes the night we checked in(flashlight and candles supplied), no hot water when the gas ran out (replacedimmediately when we informed staff). as mentioned in other posts, the waterpressure is quite low and you'll never get a full-on shower there. a couplecaveats: the roosters crow at 4-5am so that'll be your wake-up call, and forthat reason my husband will never stay there again, he vows (we'll see aboutthat :) and for me the bed was large but too soft as it was made of foam.breakfasts are ordered night before, nicely made with freshly-baked bread andexcellent yogurt, etc. and delivered to your room veranda or pool or whereveryou'd like. the overall value is excellent, the alam shanti a safe and lovelybase for you to explore ubud and north or east bali.

<Content>Absolutely Relaxing I had a wonderful time at Alam Shanti In Bali. The room was large enough with Balinese style furniture, the view was excellent and also we could order a meal from near restaurant for such a low price!Also breakfast choice was great and good one. Afternoon tea with home made cake was good. Not far from monkey forest and there was complimentary car to the town. The staff are very helpful and we are happy to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Our stay at the Alam Shanti We stayed here in May 2007 in the Shindu Room. Everything that has been written is true. It has beautfiul gardens, gorgeous bathroom, wow what a bath. Nice Staff. Free shuttle. We chose this hotel because of the reviews on this website. But..........there are a few things that you must be aware of before you stay here. Ubud is lush gorgeous and green but its an hour away from the beach. It rains alot because of the location. When you stay at Alam Shanti you only have a room, no room service, no entertainment area in hotel, no bar, no t.v.. Its very quiet and the perfect place to read a book. There are loads of mosquitoes but they do provide coils. The bed is huge but if you have back problems beware, it is a sponge matress. The bed bugs are relentless. But some bug cream sorts that out. The bedding is grey along with the towels, which are hand towels. But if this doesn't bother you then great. The pool is wonderful and the famous tea you get every afternoon is a great touch but you not getting high tea here, its black tea with a piece of sponge cake, or carrot cake, just average but nice and enjoyable. Laka Leke is average and convenient. Rather go into Ubud with the free shuttle and read up on the good restaurant in the village. Now Alam Shanti/Alam Indah do offer tours. The gentleman that took us Ketut picked us up from the airport and spoke so much to us, he sounded great. We requested him at reception and off we went on our tour the next day. It was just terrible. Very expensive, he didn't offer any information, we were physically pulled and grabbed on tour by people selling sarongs at the temples. We were taken to see batiks and told that we had to buy one to enter the temples, but you can just get them outside the temple for a donation. Ketut only wanted us to go to places where he could earn his commision. He refused to take us to the places we were keen to see. When you book a tour make sure your guide comes with you, make sure you are having lunch at a respectable place. Make sure you know exactly where you want to go. Hang onto your watches, money and cameras at any touristy place. Otherwise, Alam Shanti was nice and if you like rustic accommodation and affordable accommodation i would stay here.

<Content>Perfect Stay My wife and I just came back from our almost perfect vacation in Bali. Of course, our stays in Alam Shanti are definitely the highlights -- 5-star hotel service and villa-like personal pampering at the price less than $90 per night. We stayed in Dewi room which is on the second floor, overlooking the garden and rice field. Worth mentioning the complimentary shuttle service to downtown Ubud, it is almost like a private service and makes our get-around in Ubud very easily.

<Content>Perfect Honeymoon! Alam Shanti was the highlight of our honeymoon! We stayed in the Yamuna room and felt like royalty. The room was really more of a suite and the attention to detail was first class. We enjoyed the huge king bed, the partial open-air bathroom, and huge outdoor terrace with two day beds and a dining table where our breakfast was served. We had fantastic views of the rice paddies, which we found very relaxing and soothing. Everything, including the bathroom, was just beautiful - with lots of ethnic stonework, paitnings, and woodwork. With all there is to see and do in Ubud, we would have been content just enjoying the hospitality and environment at Alam Shanti!The infinity pool seemed to disappear into the rice fields. It was beautiful, well maintained, and a delightful treat at the end of a long, hot day!The hotel's location was also very nice - we walked to the monkey forest (about 10 minutes away) and also into town to do some shopping. We also used the hotel's free shuttle service several times a day. They were very efficient and we never had to wait long. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. This was our last stop on our honeymoon and we didn't want to leave. Alam Shanti really made a difference and if/when we are in Bali again, this will be our first stop! Alam Shanti has a total of 8 rooms spread out over their well manicured grounds. There are 4 houses each with an upstairs and downstairs accommodation. If you are looking for a quiet retreat, as opposed to a large hotel, this is the best!

<Content>Paradise on earth! We just returned to Athens, Greece from a 7 day holidays spent with close friends to Alam Shanti, Ubud. We are all eco oriented travellers and we booked Alam Shanti based on Tripadvisor's reviews. We did not regret at all! It was like a piece of paradise!We experienced an excellent combination of high quality service, lovely people, magnificent premises, safety, ... tastefull breakfast and trully picturesque surroundings. Down there we felt the absolute relax and the happiness being so close to Bali nature. Needless to say that all above in a very attractive relation between money finally spent and quality. We are all looking forward to coming back soon. Do not miss Alam Shanti!!! P.S. 1. We had a very nice dinner to Laka Leke restaurant very close to Alam Shanti 2. We had an excellent driver - guide named Wayan Merta (and his collegue. If u are interested try to find him on the web.

<Content>Out of the world!! Absolutey out of the world experience!! We lived in Alam Shanti for 6 nights. The room we stayed in was Narmada. It was a huge room came with king size bed and a huge bathroom ( shower/tub etc). There was no problem with water temperature or pressure in this room. There was a kitchen right next to our room it was huge and came with cooking range ( though I did not use it), fridge, teapot etc! The best part about our room was it had a *huge* Veranda! My memories of Bali and Ubud are going to linger on my mind for a very very long time! The morning started with a cup of bali tea ( which I brewed in the kitchen) sat in the huge veranda with my favourite book sipping in the tea as well as absorbing the beautiful view of garden/pond that was part of our bunglow.We had booked another room for my parents - for 3 days they stayed in Shindu - it was next to Narmada. It did not have its own compound but neverthless was wonderful. It had a good sized Veranda. The bathroom was huge as well. For remaining nights they shifted in Indus- which was above Narmada - Indus was good too but the AC in that room was not sufficient for the size of the room and so if you have a choice, I recommend picking Narmada. The breakfast that they provide at Alam Shanti is also more than sufficient and the pancakes/Jaffel ( not to be confused with Waffels) are wonderful. Please note that they don't have anything to mix with milk (Ovaltine, hot choclate or bournvita etc) so if you are travelling with kids you might want to carry this.The afternoon tea was something we all looked forward to as it came with tea cakes from Cafe Wayen. They also provide free shuttle to Ubud although we rarely used it as we had hired a driver - his name is Sila. He came from high recommendation from Dean who has been rated best driver in Ubud. I have high recommendation for Sila as well!! he is very gentle, good driver, laid back and best of all did not rush us anywhere. He worked around our schedule and did not have any specefic timings. Driver detailsEmail: yomansila@dps.centrin.net.idPhone: 08123 916 102I highly recommend Sila !!! All in all wonderful place ( not at all touristy - not near the beach) and most important the staff is absolutely wonderful. This probably was one of the best vacation I have had in years!

<Content>The Perfect Getaway The Alam Shanti was such a wonderful experience for our first visit to Ubud. The people were very friendly and accommodating. The accommodations were excellent--the views were stunning and the breakfasts were delicious. We were very comfortable in our surroundings, and the staff made sure of it! Having a full-time (gratis) driver was priceless. All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend the Alam Shanti for service, quality and value.

<Content>Alam Shanti-Unfortunate Experience I thought long and hard before writing this review but I do believe that my experience should be noted when deciding whether to stay at Alam Shanti. We spent four nights in the Saraswati room and up until the last day, our experience was wonderful and mirrored the previous reviews. However, on our last day while at the pool, our (locked) bedroom door lock was broken and our purses and camera stolen. When we discovered the theft on our return, we immediately went to the management and they all appeared shocked at this break-in. While I cannot fault them for their response (traveling to the poice station with us, providing us dinner and a taxi to the airport, and compensating us for our room charge), it did leave a bad taste in my mouth. Ultimately, I think this is a lovely hotel and hopefully, our experience will not be repeated. Just make sure to use the safe deposit box at the front desk for your valuables and take any additional valuables with you when spending any amount of time outside your room.

<Content>Alam Shanti - Twice in one visit! We began our 3-week honeymoon at the Alam Shanti on the advice of this website. It was beautiful and amazing. We had the Saraswati Room at $50 USD per night. The staff was gracious and kind, the pool was awesome, the grounds are beautiful and peaceful. It was as if we were the only ones there. We liked the Alam Shanti so much we booked our last three nights here as well. The hotel is outside the monkey forest, far from ubud by car, but you can walk there in 10 minutes. The staff will take you anywhere you want to go by car, just ask. We liked that it was peaceful and outside the city centre. This is a wonderful place to come and chill out after the mayhem of Kuta and Seminyak. There is only one downside, and it didn't really bother me, but it is worth mentioning. The water pressure in our Saraswati room is non-existent. It takes 30 minutes to fill a bath, and a shower is impossible. I was bathing alot outside at Nur Salon after my massages, so it didn't really matter, but if you are a bathroom nut, consider this.Two thumbs up for Alam Shanti!
