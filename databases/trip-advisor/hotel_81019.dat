<Content>Loved the Handlery! I surprised my girlfriend on Christmas with a trip to San Francisco for New Year's Eve. Once I booked my flight, I found a great deal online to stay at the Handlery.Before I arrived to San Francisco, I emailed the hotel's manager, Jon Handlery, and told him this was a surprise for my girlfriend and I really wanted her to enjoy her stay there. Not only did he upgrade us to a deluxe King room, but he provided us with snacks and a bottle of wine too. Not only was Jon a great guy, but his staff was great too, especially Hermie. He was so helpful and polite.The location is the best part of the hotel. Union Square is right around the corner, as are all the major department stores. The MUNI, Cable Car and BART stops are all within walking distance. Nothing beats being in the heart of the city, and this location is it!The room itself was very spacious. The beds were comfortable and the cleaning staff were courteous and prompt in cleaning rooms. I wish the washroom was a little bigger, but it wasn't a huge problem at all.I would definitely stay here again. For the price, you won't find a better hotel at this location. For sheer value, it's tough to find a better deal than the Handlery.

<Content>Great location, OK room Just to reiterate what others have said: this hotel is made up of two buildings. The older (historic) building, where the petite rooms are, is definitely an older style -- smaller, darker, a little musty. I didn't stay in the newer, poolside building, but it looked much larger and more modern. Make sure you know which part of the hotel you're booked into.That said, my petite room was clean and the staff was pleasant. The bed was a little small and the pillows were way too thick, but some hotels just seem to think that's a good idea. The mini-fridge was a bonus. And the location is hard to beat for tourism -- smack dab in the center of the city, just two blocks from the Powell St. BART and MUNI station. I'd stay here again if I got a good deal. San Francisco has a lot of fleabag hotels (especially further west on Geary), but this isn't one of them.

<Content>Just what we needed We stayed for three nights en-route to see family and friends in Sunnyvale for Christmas.We needed somewhere central where we could get over jet-lag, do some last minute Christmas shopping and be near places to eat and drink without having to venture far.The hotel was very clean and the staff friendly. The maid came round at around 3pm each day (we were at the end of the corridor and presumably the end of her rounds). The room had two double beds and faced a wall, but was away from traffic noise. We got a good internet rate direct with the hotel.Location was perfect - a hundred yards from Union Square and all the shops (Macy's, Saks 5th Avenue, Williams Sonoma, Tiffany's etc). There was a great diner (Max's) across the street, Lori's diner round the corner, the Daily Grill next door, a nearby pub, a sushi bar (excellent), etc etc. Next time we're in San Francisco we'll definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Location , Stylish Hotel We loved the history of the Handlery and its right smack bang in the best place in San Francisco Union Square . The room we had 361 overlooked a large open area ovelooking the pool . We felt we were a million miles away from the noise and people in Union Sq and it reminded us of Hotels in Spain that have similar areas .Room 361 was large with a outside balcony , the King sized bed was VERY comfortable and was one of the many highlights of our stay at the Handlery . To get to our room was a bit of a mission but well worth the walk .The check in staff and Bell Boys were very helpful particulary as we tried to get a cab at 5.30pm on Sat the 13th of December and it was freezing cold and beldam outside with everone trying to do there Xmas shopping .We paid $300 for 2 nights including taxes and we felt we got a bargain compared to staying at the bigger name hotels . The Handlery doesnt have all the frills of the St Regis or the Drake but the rooms were superb and met our needs to a tee.Its only a short 5 minute walk to the Bart station at Powell St ($5.35 to SFO Intl Airport) and 20 seconds to Union Sq . Lots of bars in Geary St and Farrell St to go to along with shoppping in Union Sq and the Cable Car .Highly recommend the Handlery for a reasonably priced hotel in the heart of Union Sq and located close to all the amenities San Fran has to offer .

<Content>Hurray for the Handlery and Hermie We would never consider anywhere else after staying at the Handlery - great location and a nice friendly place to be. Breakfast and dinner at the Daily Grill were really good too.On top of that Hermie, the doorman, is a star - he not only gets taxis but makes sure it is a set rate to the airport. He organises the luggage and is always smiling and welcoming.We are looking forward to our next trip to San Francisco and have already recommended the Handlery to family and friends.

<Content>Great Location Family of four including two older teens. Great location basically at Union Square; great shopping in every direction you walk. Check-in was prompt and front desk was helpful with restaurant recommendation and hailing a cab for us. Room was clean and updated - just a bit noisy from street traffic, but no big deal. Starbucks directly across the street. Based on other hotels that I checked out, The Handlery is a bargain.

<Content>Okay, but not as advertised, and don't rely on the internet The hotel is in a great location and our room was clean. However, we booked online and got a great rate, but it turned out that for this rate we were put in a small room with views of the previously mentioned brick wall with no breakfast.Also, the advertised wifi is totally unreliable. We stayed the night before an important meeting and so internet access was a priority. Wifi access costs $10 per computer per day and is provided by a company globalsuitewireless that the hotel claim to have nothing to do with. We were only able to connect to the wifi from one corner of our room (at the head of our bed, not from the desk) and even when connected the connection was painfully slow. When we mentioned this at reception they said we had to phone the globalsuitewireless customer service centre and sort it out ourselves. We mentioned it again in the morning and the manager was slightly more understanding, however we were glad that we were only staying for one night.

<Content>Great value and location Did not have high expectations after booking based on price on Expedia, but I was thoroughly pleased with The Handlery. Located around the corner from everything in Union Square. The rooms were clean, the beds were very comfortable, and the staff was friendly and attentive. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Lovely 3 Star Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Handlery with our 4 year old son for 7 nights during November 08. I booked via Expedia because of a fantastic rate offered at the time.The room I selected was the Club double queen room which are supposedly bigger and newer than the traditional rooms. Check-in was smooth and professional, and given we arrived a couple of hours early, they offered us a room immediately however it would be facing the city. We also had the option of waiting a few hours for the quieter rooms facing the pool.Since we were so tired after our flight from Sydney, we took the city facing room however upon entering the room, realised it would be way too noisy and the room seemed dark, musty and uninviting, although I must point out that it was a very cloudy and rainy day.We called reception to arrange to have our room changed to the quieter ones, which was arranged without any fuss. We just had to wait a few hours so we popped out to grab some lunch.The rooms facing the pools seemed nicer and a little larger than the room we saw first. Both were Club rooms. In the second room we were given, there is an extra vanity area between the bathroom and wardrobe that makes a good dressing area. Although the room was still a bit dark due to the gloomy day, and not quite as new as they seem on the website photos, the room was definitely to our satisfaction. Our room was facing the pool area however we were on the 6th floor so you could only see the pool if you stepped out onto the balcony. It was considerably quieter.Beds were very comfy and sheets and linen were clean, crisp and sparkling white. Rooms were a reasonable size, clean and well maintained. Staff were all friendly and the restaurant next door (Daily Grill) was fantastic - the steaks were succulent and the crab cakes were delicious!The best point of the hotel is the location...you are right on Union Square and next to everything. If you're looking for a lovely charming 3 star hotel, you can't go wrong with the Handlery. I would definitely stay there again when visiting San Fran.

<Content>Great Location, Very Good Hotel We chose this hotel because of its location, the price and the good reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed.We used the BART to and from the airport - a couple blocks walk from the Powell station to the hotel. Lots of great restaurants, theatre (live), and MUNI stations very close. The location is great.The price was very reasonable. We were given a room on the historic side of the hotel - the older side. Our room had one double bed and it almost filled the room - that was fine with us as we don't need a lot of space. We actually don't spend much time in the room anyway - other than sleeping. The room was very clean, the bathroom was very clean and it had a good shower, good lighting, hot water and lots of water pressure. The bed was comfortable. Our window looked out to an inner courtyard, but mostly we could just see hotel walls and windows around the courtyard - not a good view, but that is not what we were after. The staff were all very helpful and courteous. We used the adjacent Daily Grill for our breakfasts and it was very good - food and service. We would definitely book here again and would readily recommend the hotel to others.

<Content>Great surprise! It is always a problem booking a hotel when you have no idea what they will really turn out to be like. Pot luck! I had read some reviews on this hotel, and on a few others in the area. We were looking for somewhere quite central, rather than Fishermans Wharf area. Well this turned out to be very central and close to the 'end of line' cable car stop, which is also situated next to the BART station, on Powell St.We did have a pleasant surprise when we arrived at the hotel, as we had not thought it was going to be so big, and we had not realised that there was also a pool sitated in the centre of it!We had booked a standard double room, as most reviews which we had read, stated that the rooms were quite small. Our room was spacious, very comfortable and clean. It was very nicely decorated and well presented. The only prblem I had with the room, was that I could not open the window. It did get quite stuffy, as there was a heatwave whilst we were staying there, and the A/C was not the most powerful!The staff were pleasant enough. We stayed 7 nights at this hotel, and we have to say, that it was a pleasure. I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone. Great value for money!

<Content>Great Location!!! We just got back from our trip! This was a great location! Right in Union Square, this was our first time to San Fran and we were quite impressed with the closeness to all amenities. The room had a kind of a stuffy smell but we opened the windows and it was fine. We had two queens and the room had a wall that kinda blocked the second bed so that was good when one of us wanted to read and the other wanted to go to bed, you didn't get too bothered. The beds were supercomfy! The staff were great. Lefty O Douls next door was yummy, we had supper and breakfast there a couple times-they serve starbucks coffee....not quite as good as Tim Hortons but it'll due :) jj This was a great location and hotel for the value.

<Content>Good location, average room A well-located hotel with a great bar / breakfast room. The rooms available via Expedia are good value but worse than what you'd get by booking directly. (Our view looked straight onto a brick wall.) The overall quality of the hotel is sound, with a nice lobby, and I guess you'd get a nice room by paying more. Don't expect wonders. The best bit is the Daily Grill with excellent breakfasts and a nice place for drinks in the evening.

<Content>Great Family Hotel Our family of 5 really loved this hotel.We booked a family room that turned out to be very spacious and had 2 single beds,a double bed and a Queen sofa in 2 separate rooms.The location itself cannot be beat,close to Union Square,with great shopping and restaurants and the Cable Car basically at your door.John the Concierge is very helpful with directions and tips and although parking is a bit pricey,although typical for San Francisco,it is very convenient.We loved our stay in San Francisco made better by choosing to stay at The Handlery Union Square.

<Content>The best value for the location A great ten day stay. Super location for shopping, sightseeing, and dining. Very impressed with the staff who addressed us by name from the first day. Our room was spacious and had a balcony facing toward Market Street. The rates were extremely reasonable. I would recommend this hotel to friends (couples) and we will stay here again on our next trip to San Francisco.

<Content>Loved the location The location of The Handlery is perfect for seeing San Francisco. Friends we were travelling with stayed at The Omni and The Mark Hopkins which were beautiful hotels and much more expensive, but we always ended up meeting at The Handlery as it was so central. It was my first visit to the States and wasn鈥檛 sure what to expect, but the staff especially the Concierge were very friendly and helpful. The room was excellent we stayed in the historic section which from other reviews I was expecting to be very small, however this was not the case, it was large and very comfortable even having two TV's not that we needed them as San Francisco is amazing. The only problem was the very strange musty smell that hit you immediately on leaving the lift and also in the room. The weirdest thing was that after five minutes you didn't notice it anymore! I did mention it at reception but was not given an answer as to where it came from, although the corridor windows were always open after that. Apart from that I had a fantastic time and would definitely return.

<Content>A good base, right on Union Square Check in was quick and efficient after dropping off the car at the valet parking 鈥?we had no problem walking through the parts that were being renovated or with the lifts. The room, at the time of check in was adequate and spacious for what we needed, and looked out on to Union Square. This changed at night as it was far too noisy with general street noise, music from the band on the street, etc and we could not sleep at all 鈥?I called down to reception at 2am to ask for a room change and was told this could be done first thing the next morning. We were promptly moved to another room on the other side of the hotel (no view, but who cares 鈥?at least we could sleep!) with no problems/questions so cannot fault the efficiency of the staff 鈥?we noted that there were three other complaints about street noise from that side of the hotel, so I would take this in to consideration.Location wise, the hotel is great for access to Union Square and Market Street, etc and we even walked it to Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf (approx. 30 mins) and to ATT Park (approx. 20 mins) which we found manageable.Hotel restaurant was great 鈥?we had great food and drink here and seemed reasonably priced.Great little bar around the corner called the Gold Dust Lounge.Parking was the most expensive of our trip, but cannot be helped as there, as we could see, was no alternative. In conclusion, good location for Union Square and other places are a good walk without using transport.

<Content>Loved This Place Me and my Girlfriend stayed here for 5 nights at the end of Sept 08. Upon arriving (which was very late, we didn't get there till about 12midnight) the reception staff were very nice, and very helpful. We asked for an upgrade to a big room (we had just come from a huge suite in Vegas, and though we'd treat ourselves here!). The guy was more than helpful and arranged everything within minutes.We got a huge room with what was essentially a separate sitting room. It was an executive suite of some sort, but well worth the extra 30dollars a night on top of what we had already paid.The bed in the room was big and comfortable, the room and bathroom were both clean and the hotel staff kept them tidy.The best part about the hotel was the location. It was just perfect. within minutes of all the shops you could want. One of the main Cable Cars stops is just around the corner and brings you right over to Fishermans Warf, and Chinatown is only a 5 min walk away. The concierge was very helpful in recommending various places to eat.If going to San Fran, you would be mad not to consider this hotel!

<Content>San Francisco Holiday We stayed at the Handlery Hotel near Union Square. We had stayed there before and been extremely happy with the service we received. However on this occasion it was not quite the same. We asked for a room overlooking the front of the hotel, 'fine' said the front desk, and put us in room 505 which is overlooking an internal courtyard. Admitedly we could have complained, but after a 10 hour flight and a queue at immigration and another at the baggage carousel - it just didn't seem worth the effort. So come on Handlery your standards are slipping, other problems with the hotel were one of the lifts not working, so for a very busy big..ish hotel, one very tiny small lift was definitely not adequate when the service staff obviously didn't like us using their lift.The rest of the stay was fine, plenty of attractions, although don't go in the buffet pizza place at pier 39, it was dirty and the food was not nice.Don't think we will stay at the Handlery again. I know we could have upgraded to a club room, but at $30 per person per night, we felt this was a bit steep - I'm sure it wasn't that much in the holiday brochure.

<Content>Perfect location for exploring the city We stayed the last three nights of our three-week west coast voyage this autumn at the Hanlery Union Square. It really is almost on the square, where there was always something going on - concerts and street performances for example. All kinds of shops and restaurants are close by, and the cable car, metro, BART and bus stations in all directions are only a few paces away.The hotel itself has friendly service, a newly renovated lobby, and is genrally very orderly. The restaurant next door (daily grill) has a great breakfast (not included in price, will come to 10-25$ per person), which we enjoyed. Our room was a bit small (it was one with a single queen bed) and had a window to an inner court, but that didn't really matter. It was sufficiently clean and had the amenities we needed. For the location, it was surprisingly quiet. All in all, I would say the hotel offered great value (we paid about 85 EUR/night) for the location.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! We stayed at the Handlery Union Square Hotel for 5 nights in September/October. We had a nice room with 2 small double beds. The room was clean and in very good condition. There was a small fridge and a coffee maker. The hotel is in a great location, close to cable car and there are lots of great places to eat nearby. We went to Lori's more than once for breakfast. Didn't try the Daily Grill which is next door but it was always busy. The staff were all super friendly and very helpful with directions and suggestions. If you are driving in and returning your car, Hertz rental car has an office just around the corner. There is a coin operated laundrymat about a 5 minute walk away. We would definately recommend this hotel, we had a great time there.

<Content>The best trip. Stayed there for one week, club room was very large overlooking the swimming pool. Hotel is very comfortable and very well located. The contained Daily Grill restaurant is very good, but the hotel is very close to many other restautants. The main shopping district is right next door to the hotel. We walked to most of the attactions, but the cable car and plenty of easy to use busses are right outside. For the days when we could not manage a whole breakfast or lunch, there are several starbucks right outside.We took the Super Shuttle to and from the airport, as convienent as a taxi, but not as costly.

<Content>Fabulous We stayed at the Handlery for three nights and could not have been happier. We arrived in the afternoon only to find that our travel agent had booked us at the Handlery San Diego. The clerk called and canceled the room there and got us a room here. It could not have be handled more professionally. The room was fine, a/c, tv and a very comfortable bed. The location is very very good. We walked most places. The Daily Grill is very good, service excellent, portions huge. We ate breakfast there everyday. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks to all the staff for making a great weekend for us.

<Content>Excellent service/hotel The hotel, location and customer service were excellent. If you are planning a trip to San Francisco my husband an would highly recommend you stay at the Handlery. We planned a trip from England to see San Francisco and after lots of research thought that the Handlery seemed to be in a good location and we were not disapointed..perfect for all transportation, trolley cars round the corner and tour buses.I was unsure as we were travelling a long way about 'which' hotel to pick so I decided to e.mail Jon Handlery, I had a reply within 24hrs that was personal, and answered my questions, We booked and we were so glad we choose the Handlery.From the minute we arrived the staff were welcoming, friendly and informative. After the long flights, I expected to feel overwhelmed, however the staff and effeciency of the hotel made us feel at home almost straight away.The room we were allocated was fantastic, quiet, beautiful decor, very comfortable bed, plenty of space and we were thrilled that we had a complimentary bottle of champagne and goodies...I had mentioned beforehand that it was our 25th wedding anniversary!!! hahaMake sure that you dine and have evening drinks in hotel 'eatery/bar'. We had breakfast and evening meals and what great service, food and drink. We wandered round San Francisco in the evening, trying many bars and visiting other hotels but I can honestly say that the Handerly was in our opinion the best, with a great atmosphere and we will definately recommend it to family and friends and hopefully return soon!!!Thanyou Jon Handlery and all staff for making our trip so memorable. Sue and Ray Gardner. Blackpool England

<Content>Loved the Handlery We booked through Expedia. This was a great location, near all transportation lines (bart, cable car, etc). All the shopping you could ask for within walking distance. The hotel staff was very helpful, informative and pleasant at all times. Rooms were a nice size and clean. We would definitely book this hotel again, without a doubt.

<Content>Excellent Hotel!! This hotel has a fantastic location. It is located within steps of Union Square where there are shops (Macys,Saks etc) aswell as restaurants. There are fast food places nearby aswell as the famous Cheescake Factory (located at the top of Macys).We opted for a petite room, which was just that.... small. However it was all that we needed... a bathroom and a bed. There so much to do there that doubt much time will be spent in the room!The hotel has a bar and a restaurant, although we didnt eat there, its proces are reasonable.There is a pool which is free and has sunbeds around it.At the rear of the hotel, there is an Irish pub... annot recall the name, however their foor is excellent.The cable car line stops by union suqare on Powell Street, 2 minute walk, which takes you to the Marina.We paid 拢340 on Expedia for 5 nights at the end of August and the location of this hotel was spot on.

<Content>Great Location Got a Taxi from SFO ($30) as after a 10 hour flight could not face the Bart but it is only five mins walk away. Great location and nice Hotel. Room a little dim as facing the back of another building but clean comfortable and we were upgraded to a family suite ... the kids got thier own room ( joining ours) with a big TV and Nintendo!! Ask for a pool view room when booking as they all had little balconies and looked over the pool we just did not have time to use!.Take a left out of the Hotel and a left at the next block to Lori's Diner for a the best breakfast and Strawberry milkshake ever!! Only two mins walk from the powel and hyde cable and a shoppers dream location.

<Content>Great hotel, perfect location We stayed at the Handlery Union Square for 3 nights at the end of our trip to California. We had booked two adjoining rooms but were given inter-connecting rooms 400 and 401 which were perfect for us and our 2 children. We had loads of room. The staff were all extremely helpful, especially the conciege who recommend two lovely restaurants. We didn't have time to use the pool which was one of the reasons we booked the hotel but it looked lovely.The Handlery is in a perfect location, ideal for exploring San Francisco. The only downside was that the rooms we had were overlooking the main road and a little noisy but what can you expect with such a central location.Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Love the Location This was our third stay at this Excellent family owned Hotel, in the fantastic city of San Francisco.All the staff are polite, friendly and helpful. Rooms are well furnished and serviced daily to a very high standard. We have never used the restaurant, but only because we love the local diners.The Hotel is in the middle of all the action being well situated on Union Square. Access to buses, cable cars, china town and Macy`s store is on the doorstep.Our second visit to this hotel was to celebrate our ruby wedding anniversary and we were treated like royalty with a wonderful room, champagne and freash fruit, and an apology from John Handlery because he could not greet us personally, we did however receive a phone call from him later.This is a hotel we are very pleased to recommend.

<Content>Central location My wife and I stayed at The Handlery for two nights on route to Hawaii. The hotel's location was very convenient for sight seeing around San Francisco, close to numerous places to eat and drink, a cable car ride and many major department stores were all within walking distance. The purpose of our holiday was to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and on arrival we were greeted by John Handlery (Vice Pres) and a bottle of champagne and a basket of friut etc, were bought to our room. We found the overall experience very enjoyable and would recommend this hotel to others.One small complaint. Our room had no wardrobe space, although this may had been different had we been staying longer.

<Content>Excellent service when hotel was overbooked The hotel clerk knew our room wasn't available and immediately called Ms. Handlery, one of the managers to assist us. She graciously offered a most generous compensation for our trouble and a delightful room at a neighboring hotel for one night. When we returned to the Handlery for the balance of our stay, we found the service continued to be excellent and both of our rooms very clean  comfortable. The manager's wine and snack basket in our room was another welcome gift for the very minimal trouble. There really is a family named Handlery behind this hotel and they truly care about customer service.

<Content>Well placed and improving We liked the Handley even though it was under going refurb. Most of the staff were good and once we had worked our way through the chaos of being given the wrong rooms, more of a surprise for the current occupants, we had a very pleasent stay. The thing that really sells the Handley is its position, just off Union Sqare, yes its noisy, but hey its a city break.

<Content>Great Location, Don't Expect Luxury My family had a small reunion at the Handlery Hotel for three days in late July. I had been staying at another hotel for a conference and switched over to the Handlery because the first hotel did not have rooms available for the three nights we needed. I had done research on Tripadvisor and decided that the Handlery sounded like a good choice. I was not disappointed. As stated in previous reviews, the furnishings and decorations in the rooms were pretty old --very 70's. However, the rooms and the hallways were clean and there was upgrading in progress during our stay. We did not get to use the pool although it looked lovely. A young girl was swimming and the temperature of the water seemed warm enough. Our room faced the street, and it was not at all noisy. The best asset of this hotel is its great proximity to everything. There are wonderful restaurants within walking distance and the muni line is just a couple of blocks away. The rooms were affordable, the staff polite, and the location was excellent. It may not be the place to go if you are loking for luxury, but if you are prepared to have a pleasant, bare-bones experience, this hotel is the answer.

<Content>Absolutely fabulous I can't fault this hotel at all. It's extremely clean and comfortable. The staff are very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The concierge has a great knowledge of the city and is only too willing to help you in any way.This hotel even has it's own pool, which is something of a bonus in the centre of the city. I doubt if you could get a better location, being in the heart of Union Square you've got everything you need on the doorstep and very easy access to Fishermans Wharf. All in all we had a fantastic stay at the Handlery, and San Francisco is a beautiful city. I would not hesitate to use this hotel again and again.

<Content>Good central choice My family and I started our californian holiday in San Francisco at this hotel and we weren't disappointed. Our room was spacious, and easily accomodated us (2 Adults and an 11 and 14 year old). It was clean and close to the pool in what was referred to as a club room. The hotel is very well placed to discover San Francisco. No more than a blocks walk to trams, trolley buses and all the big name shops. Breafast at Lefty's 2 doors down was excellent and open by 7am which is an advantage when you are trying to adjust from uk time! We were lucky and had 3 days of clear weather, with temperatures in the 70's - the pool therefore was a welcome relaxation at the end of a days sightseeing although I'm not sure we would have used it for longer than an hour or so as it is in a fully enclosed courtyard. The concierge was really helpful and provided maps etc. We picked up our hire car from Alamo 2 blocks away as we left San Francisco as a car is definately not needed in the ctiy and why pay for parking etc.? But a word of warning - even at 8am on a Sunday we waited an hour and a half in line to collect our car - we heard that this normal and that we should normally expect to wait at least 2 hours!

<Content>Handlery has the best staff as well as location. This was our second trip to San Francisco and our second stay at the Handlery. The location cannot be beat! Right in the middle of Union Square and walking distance to cable car stop. Also you are very close, (within a block) of a Starbucks, Lefty O'Douls, and the Curran Theatre. The adjoining Daily Grill has a great 1/2 price happy hour and some of the best food ever!But what really makes this place special for us is the care of the staff. From the time we checked in, everyone was friendly and helpful. Many international travelers stay there and seem to be quite happy. Hermie the bellman went beyond the call of duty to make sure all our needs were met. The housekeeping staff were friendly and always said, hello, is there anything we can get you? That doesn't happen much these days at other hotels. The rooms are very clean, but a little tiny. The front desk lady did some checking to get us a room earlier than check-in time, so we could get situated.For the price, location and friendliness, this hotel cannot be beat. We will return next year during the summer, when it is 65 degrees in San Francisco and 110 degrees in Dallas(our home town).One other note: They are upgrading and there is construction going on in the corridor that connects the building, but we never heard and noise from it.

<Content>beautiful but had a small problem This was booked for our 25th wedding aniversary on july 27th unfortunately we did not know what size of room we were going to get and just like the previous comment we too ended up with a petite double... beautiful but small enough for one person only. I havn't slept in a bed that small in a long time and my husband ended up on the floor a few times . It was for one night so we put up with it.We were however next to the elevators which went up and down all night and we did not get much sleep as it seemed like there was always some one at our room door.when we were ready to check out I asked to see the manager who was apologetic and offered us a free night stay , which we coul not take him up on as we were touring california, so instead her offered us a breakfast on the house,which was lovely. Would not have been cheap if we had to pay.would recommend this hotel but if booking through hotwire be sure you get the type of room and bed size you reuire, otherwise you can be in for n uncomfortable night. location of room is also important.

<Content>Mixed bag at the Handlery We (middle-aged couple!) booked for 8 nights.Summary of stay goes as follows:Fabulous location.Hotel very clean.Staff very helpful.BUTWe were booked into Room 610. It was tiny / miniscule. There are several similarly sized rooms on each floor, according to the fire drill plan. Beware!Ice-making machine and drinks vending machine were located directly outside the door of the room. They sounded like a plane on constant take-off mode. We asked for a change of room and the staff were very understanding. We were given one immediately. It was reasonably sized but was away from the dreaded drinks and ice machines. However, it had a faulty air conditioning unit that constantly hummed even when turned off. We asked that their electrician have a look at it. He did - but nothing changed! We just got used to it.This report sounds very negative. We had our issues but the staff and location more than made up for the small room, the noise and the faulty air conditioning.Oh, I forgot! When we arrived, one lift was out of action while the second had intermittent faults. However, this only happened on the first day.

Fortunately, the hotel was in Geary Street, so close to Union Square, so we didn't have any difficulties to find it.A very nice hotel, staff and reception desk very nice, perfect positioning.The room was clean, big, very comfortable, and due to the fact we were in honeymoon, we found some amenities as welcome!

<Content>Old and sparse but great location This review is for the historic (older) section of the property. We had reserved a king bed, but were given two queens. When we asked to switch, the only room available was handicapped accessible, which I would not recommend for anyone with or without a disability. The room was small, so to accommodate a wheelchair, the TV was mounted near the ceiling (so the wheelchair could pass under the TV), and was impossible to watch for very long from anywhere in the room without getting a crick in the neck.The bathroom was large but instead of a regular door had a slider which took considerable effort to open and close, even for someone without a disability. The room and especially bathroom temperature could not be regulated, and it was uncomfortably cold to take a shower or bath, or even briefly use the facilities. The carpet was worn and the window looked onto the wall of another building, and overall the room seemed old and sad.We found out during our stay that the sauna is not available to guests staying in the historic section. The club section has sauna privileges, and may be better in other ways too.The location adjacent to Union Square was great and the restaurant/bar on the ground floor are good, but we wished we had split an entree because the food was very rich and the quantity excessive.

<Content>Nothing great... Went up to San Francisco recently for a business trip. Our travel coordinator booked me at the Handlery. When I walked into my room I noted how small my room was, then I saw my co-workers room which was about half the size of mine. The room was clean, so no problems there. Bed was ok, but not too comfortable. The tv was very small and you got a limited number handful of channels. For internet you had to pay 9.95 a day. The staff was friendly enough but not very helpful. Location was great since it was in Union Square but that was about it.

<Content>A Preview of Alcatraz! Well, upon arrival you are told you'll be paying $38/day for car parking, and when you check out an additional $10 tax is added. $86 bucks for less than 48hrs of car parking on top of being a GUEST.Ok, so now you've parked your car, English as Second Language guy tells you to go through there and so you sorta fumble your way along, ( porter did ask if he could help, but after $86 parking you're in fear what a porter will expect as a tip) So you bang your suitcase along until you reach a wooden temporary staircase wide enough for one at a time. You now have to carry your bags down a flight of stairs. Then take an elevator back up to street level. Now I wouldn't have known this except for another guest seeing my troubles and escorting us to the lobby. So we shuffle our way down the hall, and hang out for the front desk, all is well here. I give them a pass at first for the decor and construction, I say to myself, self, well at least they are showing a good faith effort at improvements The elevators are vintage but never got stuck, I however am not one for riding in vintage elevators. So we go to our room. Next door to a service elevator, and the window looks out to other guest rooms and walls about 10 feet away. So much for a view, I bite my tongue and check out the rest. The doors and fixtures are about 30 years old, and the interior decorator obviously wasn't a S.F. Local, as I thought the locals are known for interior design and decorations....Looked like I was staying in my Auntie Ann's spare room. Pink and Frilly--- Muy no es Bueno for this gringo. So again, figure I'm tired and no bother.... Get my tour book out and sit down at the desk, notice these burn marks on the desk, and a sign above that says no smoking so I figure, well looks like someone left thier crack pipe on High and charred the desk.... So now out in the halls I notice all the exposed plumbing and pipes, and electrical conduit. THis is not due to construction but normal decor for the Handlery. Next day I'm over at Alcatraz and notice that THEY TOO have the same decorations! Pretty much the room furniture looks like it was bought at a hotel surplus auction, and mish mashed together. So if your crackpipe is glowing, and your ho's don't mind a small bed well worn in, this is the place for you!

<Content>Disappointed in the Handlery Union Square Stayed there end June 2008.This hotel did not live up to my expectations based on all the positive reviews I read on the internet. We chose an older hotel for the historic value and ambiance knowing it would probably not have up to date technology or ammenities but this was really disappointing. The 6th floor room (hotel has 7 floors) was incredibly hot and stuffy for 3 of the 4 days we were there. As luck would have it San Fran was in the middle of a heat wave and the sorry excuse for an air conditioner was inadequate. Fortunately we could open the windows for air - but the view was a lovely blank wall of the building next door that I could probably touch if I could overcome my fear of heights and lean out the window - which I did not. Do NOT attempt to use the TV/Internet. Go to the 2nd floor business office and use the computers there. The room was tiny for 4 adult sized people and 2 double beds. The furnishings were pitiful - not enough storage space or chairs. The closet was equally tiny. The bathroom had only a shower stall that spit water at you, only one shelf for personal items. One of the two bed lamps was not functional. Housekeeping kept leaving glasses, mugs and coffee for 2 despite the fact that there were 4 of us staying there. Room was dingy and uninviting.On the bright side, we LOVED the staff...especially the concierge's Dale and John. They were awesome! Good location if you want to be in the heart of the city, close to mass transit and shopping. The rooms in the newer club section near the pool seem to be a better deal for the extra money. Overall I hated the room but loved the staff and location. If you go here, make sure you spend the extra bucks for a room in the newer club section.

<Content>Great position especially if you like noise! We had 4 nights at the Handlery Union Square towards the end of May. The hotel was recommended by our travle agent as being a family hotel. I had wanted to book one street back from Union Square but she talked me into this one. The hotel itself was clean enough but very cramped from the reception area to the rooms. The very worst part was that each night at around 9pm just as I was trying to settle my 10  7 yr olds off to sleep a band started playing on the street not 100 metres away. The band varied from just drums to a full rock band  played amplified music for at least 2 hours every night! It was torture! The position of the hotel is great but the downside was the street noise and my retrospectoscope tells me that I wouldn't stay there again nor recommend it to families who want their children asleep before midnight!

<Content>Great Location We (my husband and I and our 5 year old and 1 year old) stayed at the Handlery for 7 nights at the end of April. It was my second visit to SFO but the first for everyone else. With 2 small children we wanted to stay somewhere central with easy access to transport. We were not disappointed from that respect with the Handlery. Shops galore and the cable car practically at the door step.We were in a club room so after checking in, the easiest access from and to our room was from the O'Farrell St entrance. There were renovations being undertaken at the time we stayed but we were unaffected aside from the fact we had to walk through the basement to get from the lobby to our room on the other side of the hotel.Check in was easy and staff very friendly. Our room was comfortable. Even though there were 4 of us and we had a lot of luggage given we were travelling with 2 small children, we did not feel too cramped and it was useful having a small dressing table just outside the bathroom. Our room looked over O'Farrell St and we did get a bit of street noise, including music and singing from the buskers until about 11pm to 12am but it did not really bother us and our children were able to sleep through it. Our room was just outside the lift though and they were noisy. But again we were not too bothered by it but be aware of it if you a light sleeper and noise sensitive. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom small but adequate.Our coffee maker was not working but was replaced very promptly with a new one. Our room missed being serviced on one day we stayed but clean towels were delivered to us quickly once we called for them. We also got a letter of apology from John Handlery regarding this in response to a feedback form we completed. With our 1 year old we needed to get boiled water and to be able to heat up food from time to time and the staff were very accommodating about that. We were able to access the staffroom to use the microwave.We did not find the concierge very friendly or approachable but the bell hops were very helpful and accommodating.We intended to, but did not get around to trying out the Daily Grill but there are lots of cafes and restaurants close by to try and many at reasonable prices. For breakfast Loris Diner is a good choice (we went back a few times) as is Cafe Mason. Both are just around the corner from the hotel. We had breakfast at Lefty O'Doulls one day but would not back. Food was below average compared to what else was nearby and service was not great. We tried to get into Dotties True Blue Cafe on Jones St given great reviews it got on TripAdvisor but there was a long line outside so we did not wait as we had to 2 children who were very hungry at that stage.We did a lot of walking and our 5 year old managed to keep up pretty well. If you are travelling with kids, Zeum and the Exploratorium are a must. Zeum is in walking distance (about 15 mins) and the Exploratorium accessible by bus. We went to the Aquarium which was good but not really that big and to be honest, if you have been to Kelly Tarlton's in Auckland, the Sydney Aquarium or the Aquarium in Vancouver, you won't really miss anything by giving the Pier 39 Aquarium a miss. You may want to go in any event though if you have kids as they do have some touching pools where you can touch starfish and some fish.We bought the 7 day City Pass which was very handy, and definitely worthwhile if you intend to hop on and off the cable car as otherwise the one ride or daily passes are relatively expensive.The cable car turning area at Powell and Market Streets always seemed to be busy with long lines. It seemed less of a wait at the cable car turning area at the end of the Powell Hyde line.Catch the cable car to the top of Lombard St - it stops literally right at the top where pretty gardens are - rather than approach from the bottom as walking down is definitely easier than walking up! It's easy to catch the cable car back to the city from the bottom of the street.Book your Alcatraz tickets at least a couple of days in advance even in the low season. It was not peak season when we went but we still had to wait for a couple of days before there were available spaces.We did a Wok Wizz walking tour of Chinatown - our guide was very informative and gave us lots of good tips of places to go for people wanting to purchase or see particular things. The tour included a stop at the fortune cookie factory on Ross Street (I think) where we could see how the cookies were made, sample them and of course buy. It was USD5 for a big bag. Very yummy. If you are heading to Chinatown and looking for the more authentic stores, ie the ones where the locals buy their fresh fruit and vegetables and groceries etc, head to Stockton St and Jackson St. Grant St, the street with the Chinatown gate is more for tourists. Cheap T-shirts galore - about USD2 or 3 each. Ghiradelli Square and Hyde St Pier is a good place to spend a relaxing morning or afternoon, especially if you are interested in historic ships and maritime matters. It is also where the Ghiradelli chocolate factory and shops are. Although we had 7 days in SFO, we took things reasonably slowly since we were travelling with kids, but we could probably have easily spent another few days, or even a week, to see some of the other things we didn't get to!One other thing to be aware of is that it is pretty cool in SFO, apparently at any time of the year. Even though it was mid Spring when we went, we found it at times cooler than it was back in Auckland (where it was mid Autumn). Layers are definitely recommended and I would make sure you have a fleece or similar, especially for the kids if you are going to be down near hthe pier/wharf areas. Having said that, if you forget to pack them, there are plenty of places to buy them at relatively cheap prices.For non-Americans and people who have not been to the States before, it might be useful to know that pharmacies like Walgreens, which can be found all over central city, sell almost anything that you would want from a supermarket at reasonable prices so a good place to go to stock up on bottled water, snacks and the like.

<Content>Great overall hotel This hotel is a classy older property taken very good care of and very clean. I stayed one night and didn't use all the amenities but was very pleased with the room and the service. I left my watch in the room and called the next day after I got home. They had found my watch, marked and stored it and are sending it to me in the mail! I think that is great service.The parking is secure and convienient but expensive. The location is just a few doors down from the cool union square seemed to be very busy and safe and an easy walk to lots of great sites.Don't hesitate to stay here, it's a great value.

<Content>Met all our expectiations The lobby was a little shabby - worn carpet and furniture but our room was obviously recently renovated with modern bathroom (no mouldy tiling), comfortable bed, clean carpet and reasonably spacious accommodation. I think they are gradually updating the hotel.I had read in some of the reviews that the rooms could be very noisy, but without any request on our part we were relieved to discover that our room was very quiet, apart from a bit of noise from early risers in the room next door - not a problem really. Our window looked out on a stone wall but we werent concerned about the lack of view - rather have the peace and quiet. The location is great, virtually on Union Square and a short walk to the Powell Street Cable Car turnaround. If you are staying 3 days, buy the 3 day pass which is valid for cable car and bus and underground. We used it for 2 days only and found it very convenient and also avoided the nuisance of having to find the right cash for the fares.My opinion of the stafff is neutral - checkin staff very pleasant, concierge could have been a bit more informative with his answer to my questions - on the whole they were unobtrusive.Overall we werent expecting too much so were pleasantly surprised.

<Content>Great value and location I needed a centrally located hotel to stay over for one night in San Francisco. My usual was booked so I decided to try the Handlery. Some of the reviewers on the site were mixed about it but I decided to try it given it was a good price for such a great location. I was very happy. Friendly, helpful staff. Room size was good (and they had an iron and ironing board). Huge walk in wardrobe too. Yes they are renovating so there is some noise but I was only there for one night and could live with it given I was a minute from Union Square. They also have secure parking. I would go back.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel We stayed at The Handlery for 6nights for our Honeymoon. The staff were great and so accommodating. We weren't happy with our first room but within 5 minutes they had moved us to a lovely room and had all our luggage moved. The concierge was so helpful and approachable. Although the hotel was under going some construction, there was absolutely no impact on us as guests at all...We would recommend this hotel to anyone planning on going to San Francisco

<Content>what a nightmare After having a fab week in Hawaii and 3 nights in las vegas, i could not wait to see what san francisco had to offer.Arrived at the Handley at around 10.30 in the evening, and the first thing that hit us was the smell of the drainage in the hotel, had our key for the room could not believe the room it didnt look anything like in the book. The window was cracked from top to bottom and they had put tape over it , none of the windows locked properley and ontop of all that it looked like something out of the film Walking with zombies, as the only people who was walking the street was the homeless.M y husband and myself were followed and pesterd by them when we tried to go for something to eat but failed as we didnt feel safe.When going back to our room we got into bed, could not sleep from the smell of urine in the bed, up wegot and complained we were then moved to a room at the back of the hotel,not much better, but we survived the night. Had a meeting next morning with our Virgin holiday rep and she was marvelous arranged for us to be moved down to the fishermans warf in the holiday inn. Cant fault this hotel clean, loveley beds , nice area to go out in the evening.I advice anyone going to sanfrancisco dont go anywhere near the H andley as it just might spoil your hols.

<Content>Good hotel in great location I stayed at the Handlery Hotel with my husband at the end of April of this year. It's in a great location - right next to Union Square enabling us enjoy all the great shopping in the locality and take in some of the sites.Located just round the corner is the pick up station for the local Tram service too adding to attraction of this great little hotel.The rooms are clean and tidy and offer an en suite bathroom that is better than most. Don't expect a great view from some of the windows - but you're not there for the view from the room! The staff are friendly and helpful too.Tagged onto the hotel is a nice restaurant where you can pick up a great breakfast, although beware - it is not included as part of your hotel fee and it can be quite expensive. But the food is good though.I woud definately recommend this hotel for short stays that require central locations!

<Content>Ticked all the boxes Couldn't find any faults with the Handlery.Great location, 2 seconds walk from Union Square, 5 minutes from where you pick up the tram line and with very easy access to all other parts of the city.The hotel itself is very nice, our room was large and clean although it overlooked the air conditioning units, but this didn't bother us. The hotel also has a restaurant attached to it for breakfast/lunch/dinner but this is separately owned and quite expensive. For breakfast you'd be better off coming out of the hotel turning left and walking for 30 seconds to a cafe on the corner.Other than that, I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Really loved it here, perfect location I stayed here for a week at the end of april '08 with my boyfriend. We had booked a petite double room, and when we arrived we had been upgraded as it was my birthday! We were delighted. The room was a great size, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, it was so big and comfy I had to climb up on to it! There was a separate sitting room area, and the room had 2 TVs which was more than enough. We used the pool twice out of the whole week, it was lovely and heated. I think we were the only people that used it while we were there. The staff are ALL very friendly, polite and helpful. Information on restaurants, tours, directions, even flagging down cabs for us. We didn't hear any street noise apart from maybe one or two sirens which we would hear at home anyway. Also the renovations at the moment caused absolutely no problem to our stay whatsoever, there was no noise, dust, etc...The only thing was a short detour to the pool, which probably only took an extra 2 minutes! The location was brilliant, it is an absolute haven for any shopoholic. Although neither myself or my boyfriend are big shoppers, we found the location perfect. It was so close to transport and in walking distance to most attractions.Overall a great stay in San Francisco!

<Content>A huge disappointment We had read some reviews about the hotel and thought we had made a good choice. From the moment we checked in it was a huge disappointment. Our hotel room was so loud that we had a hard time sleeping. First our room was directly next to the elevator, elevator shaft and everytime the elevator moved it shook our room. Secondly, our room was on the 4th floor on the street side and the windows were so thin you could hear everything from the street below. Unfortunately, we didn't realize the extent of the noise until midway through the night or we would have been asked to move (although I can't imagine any other room much better) We also ordered room service the first night after exploring the city and the food was terrible. Even my 12 year old son who will eat anything could not finish his chicken nuggets and fries they were so bad.We could have forgiven and forgotten if we had gotten any sort of apology from management when reported our issues but they were totally unconcerned.I have never written a review before but didn't want anyone to have the same negative experience we did.

<Content>Did they tell you about ongoing Construction? hotel is ok - great location for a trip. However there is ongoing construction in the hotel. Its very noisy during the daytime until 5 or 6pm - i can hear the drilling (very loud - can't be drowned out by loud TV) as I sit in my room. My stay (and erhm...my honeymoon) ends tomorrow - suffice to say the room was not exactly useful. Manager was less then helpful although he did offer another room....which was not much point really because you can hear the construction from anywhere in the hotel. i would avoid this hotel for the rest of 2008, or until the elevator is installed......not kidding thats the reason - so it aint going to be solved quick....

We stayed 3 nights and didn't want to leave. Next time we shall try the swimming pool in the central courtyard. Great location for returning in between shopping trips to deposit our goodies. Definitely left my heart there.

<Content>A very good option in San Fran We were very happy with the location of this hotel especially considering the price ($189/nt.). It is less than a block from Powell St. and convenient for catching a cable car to get around town. Our Club room overlooked the city on the sixth floor where we did hear traffic and sirens at night.The hotel is undergoing some renovation that made for a short walk thru the parking garage from the hotel lobby, but this was not a problem.We had two adults and three teens in a room with two queens and a rollaway. There was plenty of space for all of us. It was clean and tastefully decorated.Overall, the hotel itself was nothing extraordinary. The reason why I gave it an above average mark is for the excellent location and reasonable value. I would definitely consider staying at the Handlery again.

<Content>NIce Hotel but Construction Issues right now Just came back from a four day business trip and stayed at the Handlery. Based on other folk's comments, I booked a room on the club floor through Orbitz at $200 a night. Upon arrival I needed to be escorted through the basement work area to get to the other side of the hotel because of construction that is ongoing. There are elevators on either side of the building and my room required that I enter on the O'farrell street side of the building. I heard no construction noise at all during my stay but it was a real hassle if I needed to get to the lobby. You need to take an elevator to the basment and walk through the kitchen area and then take another elevator back up to the lobby. Only one of the two elevators was working. The location is great, right near Union Squire but it is an older hotel with a very small lobby with really no place to sit to wait for someone who might be meeting you. When I arrived during the middle of the day there were plenty of bell people who wanted to wheel my luggage a few feet for me but when I made my way to the lobby on Friday night to ask a question about an airport shuttle, there were only the two ladies at the desk and I needed to wait about 20 minutes to ask my question, I guess everyone else was escorting guests to the other side of the hotel.The club room was nicely furnished and comfortable but with a very old 14 inch TV but the terry robes and bathroom magnifying mirrors were a nice touch as were the above average soaps and shampoo.I had dinner one night at the Daily Grill restaurant that is attached to the hotel. The food was fantastic and the wine list was superb, plus it has a very nice atmosphere. I would recommend the restaurant even if you are staying at another hotel. Prix fix dinner of soup, main fish course and desert at $24.95 was a great deal for this part of town. I had breakfast one morning at a little cafe just a few doors away on O'farrell street, I believe it was called Sunshine cafe. The dry eggs on an English muffin and a cup of coffee for $11.00 were a rip off.Overall, there are much nicer hotels in the area but if the price is right, this is a nice enough once the construction is complete.

<Content>Best Location in San Francisco LOCATION!!! Great location - on Union Square, walking distance to everything... It is located in the heart of San Francisco's Union Square  I mean it!World Class Shops: Nieman Marcus, Saks, Macy's, Gucci, Hermes, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chanel, YSL, OK... so enough, you know what I mean... Have $ to burn, here is your chance ;-)4 blocks to the Moscone Center, and 2 blocks to the Powell Street cable car line.Clubs  Bars: Vessel is a block  half away; Slide  Ruby Skye is 1 block away, Redwood Room @ the Cliff is 1 block away;  tons of bars down the street.Restaurants: Micheal Mina is cross the street  countless of restaurants casual restaurants around the area.All rooms feature wireless Internet access, mini refrigerators, and in-room safes. The hotel features on site valet parking ($44/night) , an outdoor heated pool, sauna, and room service.This is such a great place to stay in City when you party ;-) So girls night out, I got a suite for really good deal.... Comes with 2 conjoint rooms, 1 with a queen bed, TV, closet; the other room comes with 2 twin beds, a sofa bed, TV, chairs, table, walk in closet, a refridgerator,  coffee maker.It's a bit older hotel but very well-kept  clean. The bed is quite comfortable  the water in the shower has great pressure! There's 2 doors from both room to the bathroom.... There's 2 doors to the suite, so it's really convenient...With this room, we were able to sleep of 4 girls  1 lucky guy... LOL... It's such a great place to crash when you party!  get up the next day for shopping with your girls! A great place for tourists,  for those who love to shop, this is a place to stay if you travels with a group. NOTE: Since it's right where all the action. Don't choose room with street views because you will not be able to sleep, unless you are a New Yorker :-)PROS: Location, service,  the rate.CONS: the valet/garage is on the other building, so a long walk for you.The hotel is 3 STARS itself, so why 4 STARS for me = VALUE of the $ I paid!!! Definitely I got more compare to other hotels around the area.

<Content>Average hotel We just stayed at the Handlery a few days ago for 3 nights and were a bit disappointed. There were two families of four each and when we arrived to check in at 1:30 the told us to come back at 3:30 and our rooms would be ready. When we arrived back at 3:30, they told us the people before had a late check out and our rooms would not be ready for several hours. They then tried to locate 2 other rooms near each other but we still had to wait until 6:00 p.m. to get into our rooms. Each of our families had 2 children and waiting around was not easy. We had a club room right next to the pool and heard constant people traffic at all hours of the night. Our friends across from us got a view of a residential center with human fecies on the ground outside their window. We paid more for the Club rooms and were very disappointed. The Club rooms were big, but just average. On the flip side, the staff was very friendly and the concierge helped us frequently. We expected more and were a bit disappointed. We'll definitely stay at another hotel next time.

<Content>Awesome! Excellent Location! Look no further! Me and my boyfriend stayed at The Handlery in Feb 2008 for 4 nights. We had an absolutely fantastic time. This hotel is in the best location for shopping, eating and public transport to Fishermans Wharf etc. We would highly recommend staying at this hotel and when we return to San Francisco we will. We stayed in a club room which were spacious and very clean and comfortable. Lori's Diner is a must for breakfast located just around the corner. If staying in San Fran for 3 or more days get a Muni pass which enables you to get unlimited transportation on cable cars, buses and trams for $18 (one way journey is $5) so pass is definitely worth the money. Pick up city guides in hotel for discounts on attractions, dining and purchases.

<Content>Nice view - Helpful staff Me and some friends stayed a week here in February, we were a little upset when we arrived to find out check in wasn't until 3pm, but the room and the rest of the week definately made up for it. We had a room with a city view, which was very nice! The only con about having a city view was the noise of the downstairs traffic and the ocassional homeless person singing or just yelling... I'm a sound sleeper so I had no problems, and my friend bought some ear plugs and those seemed to help a lot. We didn't order room service, because the prices were really high.. But there were TONS of nice places to eat right around the hotel, so food was definately not a problem!

<Content>Good Enough This hotel was very pleasant. The building is rather old, but the location is really great. It's about half a block from Union Square and a lot of excellent shopping. The rooms are clean but there are a few cons: the room service isn't cheap at all and our room had a nice view of the wall nextdoor....we didn't spend much time in the room anyways.The staff was really good, the concierge really knew his stuff, recommended some nice restaurants and things to see. Gave us a good bus route out to the Cliff House. We found that cabs are a little difficult to come by at times (especially away from downtown), so if possible have the doorman hail one for you, it'll save you time. I would possibly stay here again, but I'm leaning towards checking out some other hotels in the area. For the price, this hotel was fine and I dont have any complaints.

<Content>Nice place, great location As said in other reviews, this place is in a great location. Just one block off Union Square. I was there with a conference but used to live in San Francisco, so I had mixed feelings. The other meeting participants LOVED the location and enjoyed the shoping and all the rest there is to do there. However, in a few blocks, you are really in the heart of the tenderloin, so it's necessary to be a little cautious and be aware of your surroundings. The hotel itself was nice. I stayed in the club rooms. A bit priceier but much bigger than the other rooms. A few other people in the group did not stay in this suite of rooms and complained about the small rooms. I haven't stayed in Union Square before, so I thought this was a nice place with a good meeting room.

<Content>Good location, solid hotel I've stayed at this hotel a few times when I was in San Francisco on business. The first time I stayed, I was on a lower floor, the room was very small, and my window opened in to a brick wall. The next time, I had a high floor, with a full wall of bay windows, and the room was much larger. There was actually a great little seating area that extended out over the street, and I had great views of Union Square. I'm not sure how you know which kind of room you're getting but I would have given the first one 3 stars, and the second one 5 stars.The hotel's location is great. Its right near Union Square, close to the subway, and a direct train ride to the airport. I ate at the attached restaurant (the Daily Grill) for dinner, and it was quite good. My only complaint is that I had to get up early for work, so I ordered the room service breakfast. I waited around, but 20 minutes after it was scheduled to arrive, it had still never been delivered. I tried again on my next trip, and they never even picked up my request form off the door. I'm not sure who runs the breakfast service, but it needs to be improved.Other than that, though, its a very nice hotel.

<Content>Never again The room was an adequate size, but we told it had been refurbished, not sure which century! Actually believe they had not got the the sixth floor yet.the windows had all paint falling off and would not shut and wooden blinds, do not really block out the light, curtains would have been nice, due to no double glazing and over looking the roof of another business and being so centrally located, you can start the imagine the noise levels, with the rubbish being collected during the night. if you wanted an early start, say 0600am you would have been ok, because by 0800am there was no hot water, three days on the trot!so if you want sleepness nights and a cold shower, this is the place to go.if you are on your hols stay down at pier 39 area, you are only a tram ride away from the city, where you are constantly pestered by the homeless

<Content>Awesom Handlery This Hotel is just great. We stayed at the Handlery in Dec 2007 for 3Days which was not long enough. This hotel has everything at it's front door. Great shopping,trams and buses to take you everywhere.Knowlegeable staff to tell you everything which you need if you have not been to this city before. The room was great we had a family room,it was clean and comfortable. This is a wonderful city and if you can you should go and see it. I would stay at the Handlery again if I get the chance to go again. It is nice to stay somewhere when the staff and people around you are friendly.Thank you Handlery for making our trip a great one.From the Carter Family (Lower Hutt New Zealand)

<Content>Blessed by The Handlery The American Cancer Society booked our room for us. We were visiting San Francisco to seek a second opinion of my husband's cancer diagnosis. During a time of fear and uncertainty, The Handlery was a home away from home that offered peace and tranquility. It was a mile from UCSF and we were able to walk to the medical visits (the bus line goes right down Geary to UCSF also). Not only was it convenient, but it was a great location to take-in the city; 2-3 doors off of Union Square, close to shopping and the cable cars. We took in a play a block down. We found a great neighborhood restaurant next door with great food and prices. Our suite was beautiful, clean, and spacious. The staff was professional, welcoming and helpful. Thanks to Jon Handlery for his standard of excellence and compassionate heart!

<Content>Shocked by parking fee We only stayed at the Handlery one night, and we weren't actually in the hotel much. Our room was small, but it was adequate for our needs. We didn't have a view, but the hotel had character and a certain charm. We had problems finding the hotel parking garage, and were rushed out of our car so the valet could park it. We were shocked the next morning when we discovered that our parking fee (with taxes) was $43. We had only been parked there for about 16 hours. While we were waiting for our car to be brought down, we saw the sign we had missed the day before that listed the parking charge. What we thought was a good value on a room suddenly didn't seem so good.

<Content>Needs a little TLC Check in took a while as it seemed as though there was a language barrier between all the english speakers but was happy to get room and retire to double/double room with view of brick walls however I was not worred about this. We found someone elses body hairs in the bathroom so the room was not cleaned properlyDuring the night, it rained and the noise was terrible. My family and I could not sleep at all so I approached the manager stating the issue and after hearing some feable comments where he contracticted himself a few times and I noted the classic phrase from him when I stated I choose a hotel on being able to get a good nights sleep to which he replied, not everyone chooses a hotel to sleep in???? So if you want a nigth listening to rain, this is your hotel.We were moved to another room which did not have the problem but still was not cleaned properly. I will make arrangements to stay elsewhere in future but maybe I was a one off judging by other opinions.

<Content>The Handlery and Herme were great My mom, sister, sister-in-law and I stayed at the Handlery for our yearly Xmas shopping trip. We've stayed at the Handlery now about 10 years. It has always been a great stay, but this year it was exceptional. When we went to check in, the room we usually stay in was being rennovated. Matthew (I think) at the front desk gave another room at a discount that was out of this world. We plan on staying in this one from now on. Also, Herme who works there is totally exceptional - he always brings our luggage to our room and give us all sorts of tips, shopping, restaurants, etc. Wouldn't stay anywhere else but here!!

<Content>Nice Hotel and Great Restaurant We stayed with a tour bus group of about 60 people this past weekend at the Handlery Hotel. The location was great, about a half block from Union Square. The price was quite reasonable, since we were on a tour. We had a nice room in the historic section, with 2 queen beds and it was decorated nicely and spacious. The other two couples in our group were also quite pleased. We arrived about 11:30am, and two out of three of our rooms were ready, which was a nice surprise. It was a busy weekend in San Francisco, but the staff were all very courteous. The third room was ready at 3pm. We ate at their restaurant, The Daily Grill, and it is highly recommended. The prices were reasonable and the food delicious. It is really a typical old San Francisco restaurant and Bar and the atmosphere was great. We usually stay at the St. Francis, but as this was a group tour, we tried out the Handlery. We would go back in a minute and were quite pleased with it.  We did walk through the St. Francis as it is Christmas time and they usually outdo themselves. Unfortunately, we were very, very disappointed. Their lobby was dark and shabby looking, including the worn and stained chairs in the lobby. It has recently been sold by the Westin Corportation, so maybe that's why it was so disappointing.

<Content>Phenomenal The word phenomenal is not always a good thing and in this case it is absolutely true. This place should win numerous awards for the worst possible views in the rooms. When you request a quiet room you get a room with a window that overlooks a side of a building or maybe some roofing or even piping. If you ask for a view room, you end up getting a room that is just noisy and overlooks a beautifully crowded street. I had a Executive King room, which was spacious however had the decor you might find on the Titanic, well it seems that was the last time it was renovated, and I was moved to a Club room which overlooked their pool. And a wonderful sight it was. Especially standing out on the front balcony and smelling the cigarette smell come up my way. I can tell everyone now after one night and three room moves I left and went across the street to the Westing St. Francis and for an extra 50 bucks or so I HIGHLY recommend anyone who is reading this to do the same. It is just as close to Union Square and worth the price, sorry to say Handlery is not worth 50 bucks a night. A Motel 6 is in much better condition

<Content>Clean and Cozy Great Union Square location. Had a smaller historic section room -- quite clean, cozy beds but with 2 younger children, the room was a tight squeeze. We had a great view at the front of Handlery but we also had the noise. Should've requested a quieter room. Staff were all helpful. We did arrive early and our luggage and vehicle were stored until 3:00 check-in time and that was a plus. Overall, a pleasant stay.

<Content>Hated it Yes, the location is great, but the service is sub-par. The hotel doesn't have it's own gym, they make you go to some gym a block away and pay 10 Dollars for a day-pass. For a hotel that has rather upscale ambitions that's completely unacceptable. Valet is overpriced. When I arrived there in my car, nobody from the hotel would be outside to tell people how you can get to the parking garage. Generally a very tired place. Will absolutely never go back.

<Content>Great Stay at the Handlery My wife and I just returned from a terrific 4 night stay at the Handlery to celebrate her 50th birthday. I had notified the hotel of this special occasion and, upon arrival, we were delighted to find a bottle of wine and basket of snacks. Great touch!! We loved the Handlery. We stayed in a lCub Room and it was large, comfortable and well appointed. Great bathroom and bath products; coffee maker in room; plush bathrobes,; great showers, bed; etc etc. I have seen complaints here about street noise, but I can honestly state that we did not hear a peep!! I particularly wouold like to commend the Concierge staff. THey are extremely knowledgeable and couteous---recommended a good and reasonably priced Chinese restaurant; arranged for a wine country tour and airport transport all without a hitch. This hotel is run in the tradition of a family run operation, not an impersonal chain. And above all, the Union Square location is unbeatable. You are steps from Macys and a ton of other stores.We purchased 1/2 price theatre tickets at a booth down the block. We chose not to rent a car and didn't need one. We took BART from the airport, and used the cable cars and MUNI busses to get around just fine. WE also had an excellent dinner at the Daily Grill Restaurant which is adjacentto/built into the Handlery. Good food, large portions suitable for sharing and fair prices. I commend General Manager Jon Handlery and his staff for their professionalism and hospitality and give the Handlery Union Square my highest recommendation.

<Content>Great Location, Above Average Hotel! You really can't beat the location, right in the heart of union square with tons of shops and restaurants to explore. For being an old hotel, I was impressed with the room size and amenities. The only odd thing was how to get to the room--down the hall, through the doors, upstairs, down another hall, to the elevator, to the room...it was kinda confusing! The best thing was the large bathroom vanity area with nice large vanity miorrs, great bath products (the soap is WONDERFUL!), a coffee maker, and 2 robes hanging in the closet. The bed was very large and comfy with lots of pillows. My room also came with a couch and seating area which was very nice. I didn't interact much with the staff, but they all seemed to be nice. You get the San Fran paper delivered to your room in the morning. Also, if you are going to shop at the next door Macy's, they have a coupon at the front desk for 11% off (I used it!!).

<Content>friendly and cosy hotel We stayed at the Handlery in early march 2007 having just spent a week in Las Vegas at the Luxor. both hotels we enjoyed in different ways. what i like about the Handlery was the friendly atmosphire. the staff we friendly and efficient. The room was very comfortable with all ememities. Our travel agent had obviously informed the hotel that we were on out honeymoon as when we arrived we were greated to a hamper and bottle of Champagne. I prefer smaller hotels so this was absolutely ideal for me and central . Yes, there was a some road noise, but what do you expect in the middle of a large city. it cerainly did not interrupt my sleeping. the restuarant /bar was very good, as were the local Irish vars nearby. i would certainly stay at the hotel again and have receommended it to friends. all staff were great in particular the doorman, (his name escapes me i'm sorry) but he's been there for decades). This review should have been wriiten months ago but finally got round to doing it. Liz and Mike from Wales

<Content>nice hotel This was our first trip to San Francisco. We stayed at the Handlery for 4 nights in the Club section. The room was very clean and spacious. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the pool which we were told was a lot more quiet than the ones facing the street. The only downside of the hotel to us is that it's not close to the tourist attractions. We didn't go to SF to do any shopping so we were always taking the cable cars down to the wharf. Next time we'd stay down by the wharf. The cable car turnaround was only a few blocks from the hotel and it came in handy buying the 3 day pass ($16 for unlimited rides) because if not, it's $5 a ride one way! We ate at Lefty's several times and it was excellent. Overall we had a great trip and the only reason I wouldn't stay at the Handlery again is because of the location.

<Content>Good, but noisey location. If you鈥檙e looking for somewhere to rest your head after a long day of sight seeing this hotel was and is fine. If you are so tired you'd sleep through a tornado then its ok.Jeffery on check in was great and we could not ask for more.Rooms are small, but ok. Hotel staff are good. The outdoor heated pool is a bonus. The food was ok as well. And there is loads of good food within moments walking distance from the hotel as well.The only things I can moan about are the noise from local nightclubs and street bands jamming out side the hotel.

<Content>Great Spot! A few friends and I stayed at the Handlery Hotel to shop and site see. Talk about location! I was amazed how close it was to the big Macy's and the square area, and there is a large shopping mall with a Nordstrom and Bloomingdales nearby also. We also took the trolley around the area, which was close too.The staff was very friendly, the rooms were very clean and comfortable, and even had a small fridge which was a nice touch. One tip. I stayed in a standard room and my friends stayed in a club room--BIG difference. My friends' room was MUCH bigger and even had a balcony. My room was a bit on the small side, but at least it was really quiet since it didn't face the street, but it did face another part of the building.We got a great rate online--we'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Disappointed We came from las vegas to san francisco and stayed in the handlery for 4 nights.Upon checking in the receptionist offered us a room upgrade for $60 a night.This i was unwilling to pay.When we got to our room i could not beleve the size of it ?!?! it was tiny and old with a close up veiw of a wall outside.I am not a moaner as you can see from my other reveiws but the room in need of a make-over it looked like something from 'the waltons' the room came with a fridge which did not work, i rang in a wake up call for 9am which never happened {this call could easily have been to catch a flight }.I was waiting for the lift one day and noticed the fire escape floorplan/map on the wall you could see the size of all the rooms on this ,their was our room 419 the smallest on the floor.Not a great hotel at all.

<Content>Great hotel, great location My son and I have just returned from a week at the Handlery Hotel in San Francisco. Booked through a travel agent at my request after I had done lots of reading on Trip Advisor. We stayed in one of the club rooms which was a great size - two queen beds, fridge, coffee and tea making facilities, efficient elevators, great pool etc. The location is excellent - just a few minutes from Union Square and public transport. We caught the trolley/tram to Fisherman's Wharf one day which was great and another day we got a taxi down and back which was under $10 each way - cheaper than public transport. The staff at the Handlery were obliging and friendly - we had breakfast there on two occasions which was very nice but other days we went out and about in the neighbourhood. Just a few minutes walk to Chinatown and the other great shopping areas. The club rooms seem to be the best so remember to book one of those which are the newer part of the hotel. There is an entry door from O'Farrell Street which provides access to the club rooms as well which was useful.

<Content>Great Location, Iffy service For my first trip to San Francisco, my boyfriend and I booked the Handlery in Union Square. The location really could not have been better. We were located on somewhat of a sidestreet so it wasn't too noisy, but we were near a ton of restaurants (some good/some bad) and a LOT of shopping. Our room was on the 7th floor and our view faced onto another part of the building. We had NO view of beautiful San Fran. The carpet and couch in the room were completely stained, which was a real problem for me. The TV got about 20 channels and the bathroom was alright. The bed was very comfortable, we were offered toiletries and were also able to pay for wireless internet. The location and mediocre room ended up being fine, but the cleanliness of the room irked me. I would recommend this hotel for location and overall characteristics, but it was not really luxurious.

<Content>Not bad.... Not a bad place to stay for the price and in a great location. Staff were more then friendly and accomodating. Rooms are reasonably small and bathroom is tiny. Only problem was the double charge per room per night used as a bond....which I found strange. Then it took 7 days for the money to be refunded onto our credit card, so for future travellers, make yourself aware of this if you're not a regular.

<Content>Didn't like this hotel We stayed in this hotel over the Labour Day weekend. It's in a great location right beside Union Square and very handy for the trams and public transport.Our room was in the old part of the building, the room was about the size you would expect in such a location. The rooms' furniture had loads of stains on it, the carpet had stains where someone had spilled coffee or something like this and it was never cleaned up. The bed was the most uncomfortable i've ever slept in. Generally speaking I found the room to be in need of some attention and some steam cleaning. The windows were drafty and thus there was loads of outside noise. I'm not expecting the Ritz when I stay and 3 star hotels but I do expect some degree of cleanliness. Great location but that's about - i wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Great Stay Stayed six days at the Handlery. It was comfortable, clean and in a great area. The employees were very helpful and friendly. The pool was delightful after a full days touring around. We enjoyed the amenities in the room, fridge, coffee or tea. This hotel offered more than any other hotel for the value. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Nice touch! My husband,myself and our two (adult) daughters stayed in the Handlery Union Square for four days 8th-12th Aug 2007 on our first leg of our trip which was also incorporating Las Vegas and Los Angeles. The hotel is in a very central position and good for travel to most areas of interest.The staff were very helpful and polite, the room was very much the norm for the US, twin queen beds very nice room.clean and spacious. A lovely personal gesture was the management send my husband and me a bottle of champagne and a gift basket for our 25th wedding anniversary (how did they know!)The Daily Grill restaurant within the hotel was great food reasonably priced, Lefty O' Douell's was good for breakfast as was a place on Washinton Square (through Chinatown) called Mama's is THE place for breakfast, be prepared to queue outside for a seat! Dont go to Max's Diner opposite the Handlery, up the block a bit, expensive and horrible! Also if you read this review before you visit San Fransisco and you want to go to Alcatraz book before you go, we couldnt get tickets! Go to Coit tower, Lombard Street, Fishermans Wharf and ride the Cable Car, enjoy yourselves ,. We did!

<Content>Run like hell!!!!!! Was visiting friends for 4 days and as they only have a 1 Bedroom Apartment i decided to book a hotel and settled on the Handlery after a travel agent recommended it having stayed there herself. When i got there Supershuttle dropped me at the back of the hotel so i had to walk through the parking garage and next thing i know i'm walking through a hotel corridor with rooms, Strange i think but continue on to pool area. Once at pool area i see a bellhop who tells me to leave Suitcase by stairs as they have no lift from there to Lobby. I go to lobby and check in, She tells me i have a Club room and as i'd booked a Historic Section room i think Great i've been upgraded! So i go to find room, 10 minutes of wandering corridors i still can't find room and housekeeping is giving me funny looks, So i go back to reception and they and bellman tell me room is around there, Long story short and another 20 mins later they finally tell me Oh you should be going up elevator next to lobby! Which by the way they had previously told me not to do!Get to Room 358 and it is filthy!!!!! Even the cupboards look dirty and there is no bathroom door!!!!! It looks like they've pulled it out! I go to close blinds and blinds rip and fall into my hands!!!!! As i'm jetlagged and considering how incompetant they took to issue my first room i figure whats the point asking for room change and settle in. besides the bed looks cleanI go down to see Concierge and he lazily hands me phone for Alcatraz tour i want to book and acts like my asking him to do some work is a huge imposition! Next few days consist of this;- I find Pin on floor in my room, Notify housekeeping and get no apology and they seem very nonchalant about the whole thing despite the fact it could be a legal liability!- Everytime i see Concierge he's rude and abrupt despite my acting friendly towards him- Pool area is clean but has a cheap motel look to it (Super 8 perhaps?)- As i checkout i'm issued with statement of another gentleman from the UK! As i'm in hurry running late for my flight to hawaii i don't discover this until i'm halfway across the pacific. When i ring hotel from hawaii to let them know this i speak to Front Desk manager and he starts yelling at me (Even though i was calm and friendly to him) telling me to destroy the statement, Interestingly enough he never did ask whose statement it was and when i tell him i only used internet he says something about a movie charge! i was in shock at how rude he was! Still waiting on my visa bill to make sure they haven't incorrectly billed me and a little bit concerned on how secure guests personal details are with them.The Handlery's claim to Treat Guests like family well i'd sure hate to be an enemy if this is how they treat family! This is a shoddy establishment and made Hotel Britton look like the Four Seasons (See previous review)

<Content>midget-beds! The main reason to stay in the Handlery is, of course, the location. Couldn't be more perfect. But there are a lot of other hotels on the same block, so...The rooms (we had three) were the smallest we 've had during our whole trip, but that's not that bad. Much worse were the beds.Frankly, I'm at loss for words to describe these tiny little beds in these tiny little rooms. It is impssible for two adults to sleep in it. Don't even try, I did, it does not work. Service of the staff was ok, but nothing special. Have had cleaner rooms too. (hairs in the bathroom).I was invited, so I don't know the price, but I suspect that it's barely worth the money, if at all....Next time in San Fransisco, I'm certainly going to try to find another hotel.

<Content>Good hotel on Union Square We stayed for 4 nights in May as part of a business/vacation trip. The location is hard to beat since it is within a few blocks of most everything in central SF. For the location the price really hard to beat. We have stayed several times in SF and this hotel is not bad at all when looking at the overall price, quality and location factors. One of the problems in SF is they know the rooms will be booked so unless you want to jump a up a level or two in price class, most hotel rooms look somewhat outdated. The room was clean but since a remodel is due there was a slight shabbiness to certain aspects such the rug. The stafff was helpful yet watch out the night staff who really do not want to be there.... The concierges were great at all times and really worth talking to if you are looking for a tip for the evening. The pool was clean and neat. We did not use the pool but we would have had jumping in for dip after a long day of shopping. It is outdoors (unusual) and protected from the wind and street noise. Quite well done in our opinion. We would stay here again as when we are in SF we are generally looking for a great location and clean rooms which the Handlery had.

<Content>Not as advertised The Handerly is old. It can be smelly. The rooftop suite is isolationist and has no view. When they say rooftop suite it's because you will be looking at the rooftop only.The location is very convenient, but I would look around at other hotels in the area before booking here. In hindsight, I would haev possibly chosen a more modern hotel.The lobby was small. One of the concierges was a bit of a brat to us. We did book the rooftop suite over the hotel's internet site. It was not anything like what we had expected. We asked for a different room, and they tried to pass off a queen-sized bed for a king-sized bed. You can obviously tell the difference. I just felt like they were trying to pull the wool over our eyes.The new room had two tvs. One in the sitting area, one in the bedroom area. If you used the tv remote on one tv, it would also control the other tv. So at some point, we had two tvs on, when we only wanted one. Very weird.

<Content>Great Hotel  Great location for shops  bars. We stayed 3 nights on our honeymoon and it was perfect. The hotel is lovely  clean, no issues at all with noise, we were at the back but I believe the front rooms can be quite noisy. The hotel is attached to the restraunt Daily Grill, great bar  food. If you want somthing really central and good value for money this is a great choice.

<Content>Great Location, Decent Hotel The Handlery is located in Union Square which is a great location to be in. We were able to walk to many interesting places or hop on a bus within a few blocks of the hotel.We were in SF for a convention. We stayed in a standard room. The rooms are very small. However, we weren't in the room that much, so it wasn't a big deal. The furnishings are old. They definitely could be replaced. We were very happy that the room included a fridge. We used it for bottled water and soda. We wished the Handlery had free Wi-Fi. It only has the pay Wi-Fi access. There are many hotels around the area that offer free Wi-Fi, so we will probably stay in one of them the next time if the Handlery hasn't changed.The concierge was very helpful and the whole staff was very friendly. In summary, a decent place in a great location, but needs new furnishings and a few more amenities for our taste.

<Content>Great Hotel in a great location! We stayed at the hotel while seeing the sights of San Francisco this summer and the location is perfect as sightseeing base.It is a 2 minutes walk from the shops of Union Square and about 5 minutes from the Tram stop which takes you to Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf.The hotel was clean and room was a good size.Only downside was poor quality information from the concierge on two occasions. Information related to baseball tickets and the location of outlet malls turned out to be incorrect which meant we missed a couple of opportunities to see / do.

Staff was friendly and the location is convenient to shopping and restaurants. Exterior of building looks shabby and spalling is evident. The hotel is not being maintained.

<Content>Would Never Visit Again! Where to start?? There were so many things that we weren't happy with. San Fran was our last stop after going to Bangkok, Sydney and New Zealand and we were really looking forward to it.........what a disappointment.The room was so tiny, we couldn't walk around it without bumping into each other or a piece of furniture. It looked shabby, dated and dirty with stains all over the carpet. Also, a very odd smell, sort of musty.There was no view at all - we looked out onto a brick wall so it was also very dark.The bathroom was even smaller and the shower was just an insipid dribble (we had use of more powerful showers at the camper-van sites all around NZ).The cleaning staff weren't that good - thick dust on top of door frames, on top of mirror, hairs in shower cubicle in bathroom etc.All other hotels we went to had a mini bar - this one was completely empty. The coffee provided tasted so awful I couldn't drink it.I know we only had one of the standard rooms, but it really wasn't up to a good standard at all. The whole place needs a complete face-lift.On a positive note, the pool area looked quite nice but we never had time to use it.Would defintely not visit this hotel again.

<Content>A great reasonable choice. When my husband said that I wouldn't be able to find a reasonable hotel in San Francisco, I said, Watch me! The Handlery proved to be a delightful hotel in the center of town. The room's decoration was really lovely with updated furniture, a large closet, and a comfortable couch. My son and I had twin beds and the only negative was that they were quite boingy and a little on the small side. However, they were comfortable and the air-conditioning was good. The only negative about the room was that all the windows faced a wall with other windows, so we just kept the blinds closed and it was fine. The bathroom only had a shower, which was fine for us, but might be a problem for families with small children. The hotel has a restaurant in the lobby called, The Daily Grill, that serves breakfast, but we found the prices quite high unless you order judiciously. The other places in the area also had ridiculously expensive breakfasts. There is a Starbucks nearby, which is always a safe choice. We ate dinner at The Daily Grill our first night, and for the price, I found it a little below average. There are many better choices in the neighborhood, but if you're as tired as we were, it's just fine.

<Content>good location this hotel has a good location virtually on union sq although in the taxi from the airport we passed some not very nice areas. The hotel was as you would expect from a city centre hotel very busy the foyer always seemed to be packed our check in was quick and easy we were offered a room at the front or the back we took the back because the receptionist said the front could be very noisy .The room was a triple as we had our 16 year old daughter with us we had 2 double beds and a very small bathroom you wont be swinging any cats in there. We also had a good view of the brick wall. We noticed that there were rooms with balconys overlooking the swimming pool.The hotel has a bar and restaurant attached also open to the public which got busy in the evenings but it had a good atmosphere and nice food.All in all the hotel was clean and efficient a good base for the few days at the start of our holiday.

<Content>Location, location,location Location is key. This is near or accessible to everything. My husband and I enjoyed this hotel. Our queen room was on the small side but clean  quaint. The staff was friendly. The attached Grill restaurant was a little pricey but delicious. There was no view from our room but that was okay. We could walk to so many shops  restaurants. The hotel pool is small but nice. It has an international clientele and the lobby is always crowded. Trolleys, cabs, the square, entertainment are at your front door. I would stay here again.

<Content>Handlery in San Francisco; great service, price and location My friend and I chose this hotel after many hours on the internet and reading the various reviews from other travelers...many of the reviews we read indicated that the staff was friendly and helpful; this was an understatement! Everyone was extremely friendly and did whatever they could to help us enjoy our stay to the fullest. Most especially, the doorman, Hermie and the Conceirge Dale went above and beyond the call of duty; they were fabulous!!!!!!The hotel was centrally located, it was clean, the room size was adequate (2 adults fit in the room comfortably with 2 double beds), and the price was great! We really enjoyed our stay in San Francisco and believe that the staff at the Handlery helped ensure we made the most of our stay.Be sure to eat at their restaurant; the Daily Grill (right next door) the food is out of this world and the portions are huge. In fact, if you decide to split a meal, tell the waitstaff and they will do it for you at no extra charge! Each of you will receive your ow plate complete with presentation....also, don't forget to save room for the homemade sourdough bread that is served shortly after you are seated.......I recommend this hotel/restaurant to anyone and plan to revisit them again!

<Content>Central Hotel but a bit tired... It's a very central Hotel being just off Union Sq. We had 2 rooms during our California trip in this hotel. Both were a bit tired looking but clean. Both rooms had terrible views out the window as they were at the back but at least they were quite. The beds were comfortable. Room safe and TV were ok and functional.Staff were all very friendly and helpful but there was no hotel bar other than the next door resturant! Very easy to get a Taxi as there was 2 stands very near by.Would I stay there again? As a tourist, probably not as I might want to be nearer Fisherman's Wharf.

<Content>not the best good location, but that's about all that can be said in it's favour. We booked 2 rooms, both on first floor, one at front of hotel and VERY noisy from street and traffic, with only single glazing not keeping out much noise, other room above function/dining room, noisy until 1am then more noise when staff started work at 6am, got one moved to 7th floor but rooms were drab and bathrooms very small.Won't be back, ever.

<Content>Nice Hotel, fair price The hotel is located right next to union square, so very central for the downtown area. The room was average, had a TV, hairdryer, toiletries, coffee making facilities, a safe, access to the internet via the TV, fridge.The hotel has its own bar/restaurant next door but didnt use it, but looked pleasant, there is also another bar next door where you can get drinks and food. At the back of the hotel is an Irish bar. There are a few restaurants around this area, but it is mainly shopping.The powell-mason street cable car stop is just round the corner, this takes you all the way to Pier 39. You can walk it in about 30 minutes (be prepared for a couple of steep streets!).At pier 39 there are much more restaurants and a some bars/pubs etc, so if you are looking for evening entertainment you may be better staying in this area. However we did go to Pier 39 on a couple of evenings and it is easy to get the cable car back or there is a direct bus (route 31).Hotel pool small but very quiet and nice. Staff average.We paid $987 for seven nights (not a club room and no balcony), but apparently an upgrade from a basic room. booked direct with the hotel.

<Content>Sktechy Experience at the Handlery This may be a fluke, but I had a very strange stay at the Handlery in July of 2007. When I arrived in my room, it wasn't clean, and the door was actually propped open. There were used towels and washcloths on the floor and it didn't look completely cleaned.After informing the front desk I took a walk, and returned to find my door propped open (now with my luggage in the room) and the towels picked up, but trash on the nightstand, the previous occupant's VISA bill.The phone didn't work, and neither did the wireless network.Normally hotels in SF or NYC often have quirks like this and you're lucky not to take a second mortgage to pay for it, but I still didn't have a great room experience.The staff is incredibly friendly and professional and so the room experience may just be an abberation.

<Content>The Handlery Union Square club room was s-o-o comfortable We stayed at the Handlery Union Square Hotel club room 6 nights. It was the most restful stay that I have ever had in a hotel room. It was pricey but well worth the money.It is within walking distance to transportation and close to the Powell Mason cable car line. We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the room, the amenities and the friendliness of the staff.

<Content>Delightful We returned last night from a 4 night stay and were delighted with the hotel, its location and staff. We had a club room with balcony, overlooking the courtyard. The room was large, well furnished and quiet. The cleaning staff had our room made up whilst we had breakfast, did a good job and were very polite and pleasant. Same for the front desk, concierge and doormen. It is a way to the club rooms, no big deal, one can take the elevator to L level, and be right on O'Farrell street, without having to go through the hall and lobby. We were amazed at the price and value for a quality hotel on Geary St, we have payed more than double for a smaller room, in a less desirable location. Will absolutely return to this superb establishment.

<Content>Ideally located hotel We, a family of three, stayed at the Handlery for six nights at the end of June. The hotel is ideally situated half a block from Union Square, near the main shops and transport areas. As per the previous review, many people stay near Fishermans Wharf, and that's where we were orginally going to stay but the Union Square area is definitely a better option.The room was very generously sized, clean and there was a fridge, which was a bonus. We were in the older part of the hotel but that was fine as it was quite quiet.The staff were friendly and helpful - we requested a bathroom with a bathtub, which we got; the concierge helped me book a wine (and champagne) tasting tour - definitely worth doing; and gave us information about transport back to the airport.

<Author>Something-Different!
<Content>Loved the Handlery, but would stay in Fishermans Wharf next time We stayed at the Handlery as part of a Californian round trip. The hotel is situated right off Union Square which is boarded by loads of shops of the chain store variiety. The hotel itself, from the outside, is nothing to look at. However, inside, the check-in staff and the concierge are very helpful and efficent. The hotel is built in a square with only 3 floors and the pool is in the centre of the hotel. The rooms are large and very well appointed, with balconies overlooking the pool. Large super kingsize beds, tv, minibar etc - fairly standard American rooms but very well appointed and very clean. Its only a short walk to Chinatown but a good walk from Fishermans Wharf. As a hotel I would recommend but some distance from the touristy bit of San Francisco.

<Content>Great Value for Money I stayed at the Handlery for 3 nights at the end of April. It was our first tim to San Francisco. The location was perfect, many people tend to stay in Fisherman's Wharf rather than the Union Sq area, but I can honestly say, the you are better off staying in Union Sq. This is where all the bars, restaurant  theatres are located. Perfect for spending the day around Fisherman's Wharf before it closes. I had a very large Club room over looking the pub opposite on a main road. It was a bit noisy at night, but we are in the middle of a city, so what do you expect? The room very very clean  the bed extrealy comfortable. The service from the staff also very good. I would deffintly stay here again.Oh,  be sure to visit Leftie O'Dools pub/restuarant next door. Very good value for money  excellent free entertainment.

<Content>Good Hotel, Great Location As everyone has already said, the location is top notch for this hotel. It is right on Union Square, great for bars, restaurants and particularly shopping. The hotel itself is really good. We paid extra for the club room and it is well worth it. A really good sized room right next to the pool. The pool is worth staying here alone - an absolute oasis after a hard days shopping. On the downside, the reception staff were inefficient and normally failed with whatever task you gave them and there is no hotel bar ( but the irish bar two doors down is ok) but if you're up late you'll probably be in one of the livelier areas such as north beach or castro, so it isn;t a great problem.Overall a hearty recommendation

<Content>Loved the Handlery We have just spent 4 nights at the Handlery hotel in the Club section overlooking the pool. The king room was a good size for the two of us and the bed was comfortable and pillows soft. The bathroom was clean I always like to see really clean towels which they were. A small downside was that our room (316) was a little too near the elevator and although there was no noise from the elevator itself there was from guests coming and going at early/late hours. Staff made us feel at ease and answered all our enquiries and requests quickly and were very helpful. We ate both breakfast and dinner in the attached Daily Grill and were not disappointed by either the prices or the quality of food served. The pool area is a lovely sun spot and the pool was warm to swim in. Altogether a very nice hotel (Club Section) with helpful and willing staff. Would stay again if visiting the Union Square area again.

<Content>Not worth the price! The location of this hotel is excellent but the rooms were rather dated and smelt musty (as did the corridors). We were initially given an inner room on the second floor which overlooked a bunch of pipes and the airconditioning unit was incredibly noisy. I complained and they agreed to move us to a room with a view on the third floor. We were then given a room overlooking the street (not a great choice as the noise at night was incredible). After 2 nights I complained again and was told that the hotel was full due to a medical conference. However we returned later and were moved to the fifth floor. We managed to get some sleep on this level but for the price we had pre-paid I was incredibly disappointed .

<Content>Wouldn't choose again We found our room to be way too small. Our window faced another part of the building so we had no view. The room/hallways, etc were very clean and I thought the staff was nice/helpful. It was convenient to the convention center, Chinatown, shopping but I would choose something else next time.

<Content>KUDOS!!! I really enjoyed staying at the Handlery. I got an excellent price compared to other hotel rates in the union square area. The rooms were modern and average size. I found the beds to be very comfortable. Nice and cushy. Those who prefer hard beds may not like them, but I was in heaven. Staff was very accomodating and helpful. I was greeted every morning along with a smile. They also had a pool which was a pretty decent size. The pool is a great ammenity since not too many hotels in the area offer one.I would highly reccomend the handlery!

<Content>Wonderful hotel;wonderful people! We have just returned from a five day stay at The Handlery, and we could not have asked for a better experience! We were treated like special guests the entire time we were there ( we had never stayed there before). Our entire family was in San Francisco for a wedding, and we all stayed at The Handlery. When our son and daughter-in-law checked in with our little granddaughter, they made very special accomodations so that they would feel as comfortable as possible. We all hated to leave!We would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to San Francisco, and we will definitely make it our hotel of choice!

<Content>Lovely hotel, accomodating staff. I LOVED this hotel. The Room was really comfortable and we were up high so we had a great view. The guy at the check-in desk was so accomodating too. When we got to our room I realised it wasn't a smoking room, which I think was my own fault, I think I forgot to specify when I booked. I called the front desk and although the hotel was very busy, the guy managed to sort something out and got us a smoking room. Considering we were paying the absolute cheapest flat rate, I thought that was very obliging.The Hotel is lovely. It has an outdoor pool on a veranda - courtyard type thing in the middle - looks really cool, but we were there in October so didn't use it!! Apparently is is heated all year round though!The only negative I would have is just my own personal preference. I'm not a big fan of the Union square area. It's just not as nice as other parts of the city. I much prefer Chinatown/North Beach and the Wharf (although the Wharf is sooooooooo touristy, so probably not the best place to stay unless you're into that sort of thing). Also, you have to be careful around the Union Square area. Where this hotel is is perfectly safe, but once you go a few blocks from union sq you're into dodgey areas. There are alot of homeless in this area too - which is not a major problem and I hate to be uncompassionate, but when you're in a bar in the area and EVERY time you go out for a cigarette you get approached by pan handlers, it does get a bit tiresome! (again, I hate to be uncompassionate, but I'm just being honest)

<Content>Fantastic hotel! We just returned from the Handlery spending Mother's Day's weekend in this wonderful hotel. The staff went out of their way to be friendly, accommodating and efficient. We got the Romance Package and it was GREAT. Includes breakfast, champange  chocolates and valet parking. Get the % off your bill for the # of years you've been married. What a fabulous deal we got! Check it out...We have stayed at many hotels in S.F. and found this hotel to be head and shoulders above the mid  high end hotels. We will return to the Handlery again based on the quality of the room (king club size), cleanliness, friendly staff, and excellent service. We also took the Cable Car from Fisherman's Wharf  Pier 39 to within 1/2 block of the Handlery. How convenient! We recommend this hotel with 5+ stars!

<Content>hotel set in the 60's Just returned form our five day stay at this hotel; First of all the location, right in the middle of union square, was perfect.. San Francisco was lovely and the people everywhere were very friendly, possibly a little too much!! However, the hotel is in desperate need of a make over and looks absolutly awful from the outside. Our room was street facing which subsequently meant that we got absolutly no sleep for the week that we were there. Unless you enjoy the constant horn pressing, the bizarre bin emptying at 3am and the odd screaming match between taxi drivers, who have cut each other up. You, too will end up sleep deprived. Each room appears to be different however and other rooms in our party appeared to be quite sweet. Despite this please be very careful with the electrics...Blue sparks were quite common. For the ( uk) women don't even bother taking your hair dryer, cos it won't work, the voltage difference is extremely noticable. Use the one in the bathroom, which despite looking 100 years old, does actually work. Hair straighteners do work...Eventually but you do have to be patient ie plug them in 20mins before you intend to use them and it will take a lot longer. The staff appeared to be very pleasant with us, however if you are a day under 40, take your passport with you everywhere, cos they won't believe that you are old enough to drink! Quite flattering at first but then gets annoying! I would certainly recommend the location of the hotel to everyone, as we had a fantastic time in San Francisco but I'm sure that you could get a nicer hotel for the same price. It really is in desperate need of modernising and double glazing wouldn't go a miss!!!

<Content>Great Hotel ... wonderful staff ... perfect location in a brilliant city! Fabulous, quaint hotel with lots of charm. The staff were great, friendly and most accommodating. Hermie (Bellman) was fun and helpful. The Lady Concierge (there are several different ones that work there I know) but the lady who helped us many times (sorry I didn't get her name) was most obliging, a wealth of information and just a gem! Loved San Francisco ... the best overseas city I've been to in a while and would definitely go back there ... and would definitely stay at the Handlery again! Best part of our 3 week trip to the States!

<Content>Cute, quant hotel in a great location After reading some of earlier reviews of this hotel, I steeled myself for the worst and was pleasantly surprised. It was charming and old-fashioned with lots of atmosphere. The price was fantastic for the location. Handlery is located 1/2 a block from Union Square in a touristy but charming neighborhood. Walking into the bustling lobby was like hopping into a time machine. Check in was easy, I have no complaints about the service. I ended up extending my stay and my key card was accidentally turned off but the front desk fixed the problem promptly. I did notice that sometimes there would only be 1 or 2 harried staff at the front desk during off-peak hours which meant waiting for a couple minutes while they juggled phone calls. My one complaint was that although they offer room service for breakfast, the menu wasn't easy to find and the housekeeper kept forgetting to leave it in my room. As for my room, it was smaller than a typical chain, but larger than most similarly priced European hotels (that Handlery claims to emulate). Unlike many large chains where two queen sized beds are the norm, it seemed like at Handlery you get what you pay for. I asked for a room for one person, and it was plenty roomy for me but I wouldn't have wanted to fit more than two people in there. The bed was a smallish double with very nice linens. The closet strangely, was enormous-larger than the bathroom (which was comfy for one but on the small side for two). There was a small desk and chair in the corner but I just worked on the bed. I can understand the complaints from couples and families. If extra space is important you might want to check when you make a reservations and see if there are larger rooms. Ditto for business traveler who really need a full sized desk. For one person it was fantastic-the privacy of a big hotel with the character of a historical inn.

<Content>Absolutley Loved It San Francisco is, next to sydney, my favourite city in the whole entire world. Bursting with life and character, one of the most beautiful, fun and intriguing places i have ever been. Seriously there is absolutley nothing better. I just feel so at home there and the Handlery is NO exception. This hotel has everything. It's not five star and ive stayed at my fair share of five star but its definitley my favourite hotel ive ever stayed at. This is because of the homely feel it gives off. It's just so nice to come back to something so comfortable. The rooms are beautiful and have good views of just the life of San Francisco. The service is good and on time and they are very grateful when complimented. The in room dining is very good (room service) and i just cannot stress how homely the whole hotel is. The beds are plump and comfortable beyond belief. So relaxing after such a bussling day. The hotel has a very old school appeal, no flashy hallways but just nicely carpeted hall ways with nice wooden doors. The rooms are that way aswell. The staff are nice beyond belief and the whole hotel is very classic. The food is nothing to get extremley excited over but it is definitley nice and completley relevant. This hotel has not one flaw and is hugely recommended. Family orientated and perfect for the joy that is San Francisco.

<Content>Wish we could have stayed longer We just spent 4 nights at the Handlery while we were visiting SF to participate in a friend's wedding. From the moment we walked into the lobby the staff was pleasant and helpful. We paid a little more per night to stay on the Club level and we thought it was a great investment. Large room, great balcony, quiet and clean. We had drinkswith friends in the Grill Restaurant located just off the lobby and had a great time.Several other members of the wedding party stayed 2 blocks away at the swanky Clift Hotel and we couldn't have been happier that we weren't staying there. The Handlery was not luxurious, but provided a clean, pleasant atmosphere in the heart of Union Square. I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Happy until we were charged twice months later Staying here for a few days was good enough except for the overly-soft bed that killed my back which I felt when I returned home later.The worst thing of all was that 2 months later, the hotel charged us again from our credit card. We telephoned  was told there was no record of payment  they thought we left without paying. How is it even possible to believe that when we handed back the keys, received our receipt, etc? Eventually, our original payment was located  we received a refund  whilst we weren't upset about the error happening, the fact they didn't bother to contact us BEFORE deducting our credit card willy-nilly did. They could have telephoned or emailed (they had been emailing advertising with no problems) to enquire but didn't bother so we had to call them at our expense (international). The lady who sorted out the problem was apologetic  handled it all quickly  efficiently  offered to refund any difference with the exchange if it went against us. We did lose out with the exchange rate plus the telephone calls but we couldn't be bothered pursuing this further  just wanted it ended.

<Content>Handlery Hotel Valet parking scracthed my car!!! The Handlery Hotel's valet-only cement garage parking scratched my car door, they requested me to fill out a claim form, then request re-fax because they said they could not read it. Now I received a letter saying I didn't report the damage before I left their garage so they are denying the claim. So why didn't they say this upfront instead of requesting claim form, re-send, etc.? Handlery Management did not even have the courtesy to call me and talk to me about it. Not an acceptable reply from the Handlery Hotel operation. Also the 1st room they gave us was next to a noisy Ice Machine, got them to move us to another room but the Ceiling Duct Ventilation Air Fan ran all night keeping me awake, they fixed the next night after I complained but gave no credit for the miserable night in their malfunctioning room AND damaged my car! I was happy to leave and arrive at my own quiet home to finally get a good nights sleep. I noticed the damage when I got out in my own driveway and promptly called them, approximately an hour and half after departing theri gloomy cement garage. Shame on them for neglect and damage to my car that I trusted to their possession. More to come.

<Content>Terrible staff but club room is great Our family stayed in a club room for 2 nights in February. We didn't see ANY employees smile during the three days except the waiters in the hotel restaurant. We felt that they didn't care if we stay or not. Their location is great and the rate is reasonable, so they are not worried about losing unhappy customers.It is not easy to go to the club rooms from the lobby. You need to go out of the building and enter another one in the back, not to mention there are twentyish stairs you need to take. It would be difficult for the guests who have lots of luggages. We didn't see any signs directing us to the club rooms. The direction was only provided verbally by the front desk staff and it was not clear enough to the first time visitors. I think a hotel map should be showed to club room guests when the direction is given. One of the front desk employees was very inexperienced of dealing with complains and was rude. The room itself is great except the noise at night from the street. I was waken by the siren both nights. Our room was facing O'Farrell street and the view was good. That was why we didn't request room change. The other option is to have a room facing courtyard/pool. We just didn't like it.I don't want to stay in this hotel ever again.

<Content>Good location, but dissapointing hotel My wife and I booked the Handlery on a recommendation made by a friend for the San Francisco part of our California roadtrip down route 1. As other reviews say, the location is good for the downtown shopping, getting to galleries and other spots (some may find the location too 'urban', with lots of homeless milling around, but we're from London so we're used to it!). However, we found the hotel to be only dissapointment amongst anumber of good hotels (at varying price levels) that we stayed in on our trip. Really it comes down to variable service and the hotel being in need of modernisation face lift.When we first checked in, we had polite but hardly friendly service. The initial room they showed us was dark (with only small window onto a dark courtyard) and next to the escalators so we asked to have another room. The next room, which we ended up taking, was small, with not much space beyond the bed, had a low ceiling and faced out onto the street. But it was clean so we took it. However, when we went down later to get the door key changed to the new room we found the man on the front desk very rude and treated us very suspiciously before changing things over.Checking out was hardly better. We decided to leave a night early (despite having paid in advanced for all nights of our stay via expedia) and to head up to Marin County to stay a night with friends up there (which seemed a much better proposition). Again cool service on the front desk and they tried to charge us an extra day for the extortionate $42 for parking. Finally they then lost our bags for 20 minutes when got to the garage to pick up the car.Anyway, as other reviews alude, the Handlery has some period character, and that may be true, but its desperately in need of modernising inside the rooms and in the public areas. We also found the corridors on our floor to be very dark and dare I say a bit smelly. However, on the upside, the price was good, hence why the rating isn't the pits.Ultimately we won't be going back.

<Content>Average Handlery, very average! Stayed 5-12th February. Had stayed some 15 years ago at the hotel (not that I remember much about it then!)Arrived early after a very long flight hoping to get into room early, wasnt available but promised it by 3 which was ok.Conceige awful, unfriendly and no help at all. No bellhop available to take care of bags at checkin, and as room wasnt ready wanted to leave bags at hotel! Conceige rather unhappily agreed to help.Room was in moderate condition, quite dark during the day but fittings fine as well as decor.No real issues with the place, it served it's purpose - but staff were overly rude or even worse, simply uninterested!Probably a good hotel for families or those on a short stay, we stayed for a full week and the long distance between the club wing and the main hotel got to be a bit of pain after a while, especially when carrying huge amounts of shopping (our own fault I suppose!).Quite old-fashioned in a way - particularly the hair salon which seemed like it had been transplanted from another century! Still amusing to walk past every day.Wouldnt stay here again

<Content>Great Little Hotel For our first trip to SF we picked the Handlery out of the list provided by Orbitz. We weren't disappointed. Although we don't use many hotel services, those we did require were excellent. All staff we had contact with were very friendly and anxious to be of service. The room was quite nice and certainly worth the price. The only negative was the fact that we found the restaurant pricey, but there were many other choices with in two blocks. All is all, we highly recommend this little jewel.

<Content>Older-Style Union Square Hotel With Charm Nice hotel older-style San Francisco hotel in great location just steps from the tourist shopping mecca of Union Square. Smaller rooms typical to older SF hotels, the Handlery is clean and well appointed. Rooms are small, but again, typical to the hotels of this area and era. If you like character, a location is a must, but can hamdle a smaller your the Handlery willbe great. If you need ammenities, space, a 4-star plus try some of the higher priced options. If not, enjoy...

<Content>Great Introduction to San Francisco My husband and I stayed at the Handlery March 2-3-4. We loved it ! The price was competitive, our room was small but very clean and the staff couldn't have been nicer!From the minute we walked in we were greeted with big smiles and friendliness and when we left we were encouraged to come back soon. Desk staff Erica and Manny were great and John, the concierge was wonderful. he gave us good tips and directions that were flawless.Saturday night we asked if we could change rooms because we had the neighbors from Hell and the change was made quickly and kindly. No questions asked.We ate our meals at The Daily Grill and found the menu to be varied and everything we had was delicious. Again, everyone was very friendly and helpful.We would go back again in a minute.

<Content>Fanstatic location, loved the hotel, brilliant concierge. Stayed at this Hotel 15, 16th of Feb. What a fantastic location. The trams run within 30 yards of the door, Union square and Macy's are the same distance away. The rooms are very clean and comfortable there is more than enough space for a family of 4 as we are.I have to compliment the concierge, in particular a guy called Hermy, he could not do enough to make our stay a good one.He arranged everthing we needed to get back to the airport, all we needed to do was turn up on time. Fantatsic guy, give him a good tip !!

<Content>Great Location - slightly dated Great Location. Having stayed in San Francisco a few years back we chose this hotel due to its location and the reviews posted here. Upon arrival we were told that there was no double-rooms left and they would upgrade us to a suite by the pool. That sounded nice, however beware - some of the suite rooms are directly off the pool area which might be noisy in peak times, also this was an adjoining room and in previous hotels we've had issues with noise from the adjoining doors. The rooms were ok, if a little dated. We were ok for noise though as the pool was closed for renovation and our view was simply some orange plastic tape (ok for two nights, but might have complained if we were there for longer!). Staff pleasant. The attached restaurant and bar are good locations to chill out.

<Content>Gave me faith in America I spent a month in America and Canada over new years and into january with my fiance. Our last stop was the Handlery and boy what a relief! I really enjoyed this hotel. Had an terrible time in most of the U.S, and before i stayed there i had given up. But was very pleasently surprised. Our room was more comfortable than the Banff springs hotel in Canada. Even though i much prefer Canada to the U.S i did enjoy sanfrancisco, and this hotel had a lot to do with it. The bell boys were fantastic, special mention to Hermie who went out of his way to make our stay as good as possible. We had a great view over the city streets , my only slight grievence was the noise, but hay , this is Sanfrancisco.Congratulations Handlery, if i ever return to the U.S this little aussie will be visiting you again. I intend to explore your San Diego resort also thanks to what Hermie told us about it.

<Content>Good location but old and smelly Stayed here for 2 nights between Christmas and New Year. The hotel is in a great location ,but we had requested non-smoking and were given a smoking room. Had to be moved. No view and dark room (stained carpet) with an odd smell about the entire hotel, I guess this is because it is old. Room size okay but bathroom small. Staff not overly helpful. Uncomfortable pillows but quite clean. The hotel Grill and bar was quite good. Would look for somewhere else next time.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location. My new hubby and I stayed her in August 2006 at the end of our honeymoon. This is a nice hotel - its not cheap, but you pay for the location really. Its just off Union Square and the tram stops at the corner. The restaurant in the hotel is a little pricey and so I'd suggest going out for food. There is a nice little cafe on the square with tables outside so you can people watch - and enjoy the atmosphere.The rooms are clean, the staff are very good and the concierge's were excellent.Top tips: There is an Irish Bar (O'Riely's) on the street behind, which has live music and does good food - definitely go there.Go on a trip called Shopping and Sipping - run by a nice guy and you get to do a Winery as well as a outlet mall - brilliant!

<Content>Fantastic Location We stayed here for two nights as part of a work holiday. The location is fantastic, within a 1 minute walk you are in the heart of Union Square with numerous shops and restaurants to choose from. We chose not to eat from the hotel's restaurant and instead walked around the corner to an Irish Pub which served cheap breakfasts, lunches and dinners.Rooms were of a good size with 2x Queen Size beds, large TV enclosure and reasonable size bathroom. Rooms looked out across to their other accommodation block, but the amount of time we spent in the room it honestly didnt matter. Everything was clean and tidy. Rooms were serviced daily with clean towels :-)

<Content>Great place and location Excellent stay for 5 nights. Have stayed in the sister hotel in San Diego and this is the same high standard. brilliant location right on union square. A large room with all of the usual stuff you expect in the USA. Great standard of hotel for a great price . The only warning is if you want a quiet night the rooms at the front are a little noisy from the traffic on the street, but hey get out and enjoy it and you will be too tierd to care. ! Check out the Gold Rush bar around the corner , a fab little place. Its all in the location baby !

<Content>Helpful staff, good location We stayed three nights at the Handlery and all contact with staff showed them to be very pleasant and helpful. We stayed in a club room which was larger than the standard - a real bonus when travelling with a number of suitcases. The location is good being adjacant to Union Square and close to shopping, restaurants and the cable car.

<Content>Lovely hotel Got their late at night after an exhausting delayed flight, Dont travel TED (UA). Hotel quickly booked us in and brought up our bags, there was a botel of bubbly waiting in ice which had melted, due to us being late. Staff and housekeeping where polite and friendly, room service was great.What did it for me about this hotel was the location, a stones throw from union square, around the corner from china town. Loads of designer stores and shopping malls. A 5min taxi ride to the piers. I would reccommend taking a helicopter ride of the city.

<Content>poor front of house staff we just completed a 2 week holiday to LA and San Francisco staying in 4 hotels. The Handlery was the only one we werent happy with because they didn't seem to care whether we were there or not , much less if we were enjoying our 4 day stay. The worst offender was probably the concierge who seemed to think we were honoured to have him sell us our MUNI passes. The bellboys were friendly and efficient. Shame about the rest though, cos with good front of house staff it could have been much nicer. The location was great, the beggars intimidating for the elderly member of our party and unpleasant for the rest of us.

<Content>Can't beat the location Location, location, location - need I say more. This hotel is in the centre of the CBD, close to the trolley cars, buses and BART station. As a family of five travelling from Australia, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Handlery. We had a corner 'family suite' in the front older part of the hotel which had plenty of room for us and all of our luggage. The smaller room held a double (or queen?) bed while the adjoining room for the kids was huge with two twin beds and a fold out double sofa bed. With the sofa away, we had a large lounge area with coffee table - perfect for lolling around in after a day on the streets of San Franciso.This kids also enjoyed the pool - which was outdoors but heated. Nearby there are plenty of family friendly options for food, including a Walgreens around the corner where we were able to buy breakfast supplies (there was a fridge in the kids room). The Irish pub next door has a fantastic dinner buffet, and the bar around the corner has a champagne happy hour and live music (for Mum  Dad's time out).My tip for family's is to use the BART to travel back to the airport. We easily wheeled 7 suitcases between us (yes 7) to the station as it is all downhill and caught a fast and clean BART train to the airport terminal for a fraction of the cost of an airport bus. More money to spend in the wonderful shops in Chinatown!

<Content>Terrific hotel in a great location We travelled with another couple for our anniversary celebration and San Francisco was our last stop in California. We had booked 2 nights at the Handlery and wish we could have stayed a few days longer. The hotel was attractive  clean, the staff professional and because it had been noted that it was our anniversary, Mr. Handlery came out to welcome us and our club rooms had a beautiful basket of fruit  champagne when we arrived. This was all a very thoughtful  nice touch. The rooms were clean and had comfortable king sized beds and very nice bathrooms with plush bath towels  bathrobes and a nice little balcony overlooking the courtyard w/pool and all the amenities you would expect. We were in the newer section and everything was just fine and we would stay at this hotel again in the future.The location is central to all  San Francisco is a great city. We're from NYC  this city reminded us somewhat of a smaller NY  it's neighborhoods of some of the boros. We walked all over (be sure to bring sneakers or good walking shoes cause some of the streets are unbelievably hilly)  when we weren't walking we took the cable cars (get the day passes, much less expensive).

<Content>Brilliant location! This is a great base for exploring San Fran - right in the heart of Union Square next to Macy's, good restuarants, Chinatown and the Tram! It was the end of our holiday and we spent 3 nights here after staying in 4/5* hotels. At first i was a little disappointed with the room. A little small, no view and a little noisy but the bed was comfortable, hotel very clean, staff lovely and we used the hotel as a base for our tours and to shop! I used to book this all the time when i was a travel agent so glad i got to stay here. Friends who stayed in Westin St Francis opposite preferred our hotel - definite recommondation from me if you want a clean comfortable base!

<Content>Overpriced. Although eventually we were happy with our room, we did have to ask to be moved from the original one allocated. We had booked a king size room also requesting a quiet location (after reading reviews on Trip Advisor). We got a good sized room, but everything seemed a little tired.Pleased with the front desk for not hesitating to change our room. Well located hotel and helpful conciege recommended a good Thai restuarant for us to try. We ended up eating there twice.

<Content>Where to start? Just really really disappointing As I said, where to start? My husband and I spent a month travelling around California in September and early October. San Francisco was one of our early stops. Supposedly it was to be the highlight at the end of a relaxing 10 day trip up the PCH before we headed off to Lake Tahoe and then Yosemite and Death Valley. Figuring we'd be exhausted after moving on every 2 days we booked the Handlery for 4 days. I've visited San Francisco twice before - but the most recent time was 7 yrs ago. And BOY has the city changed! When booking a hotel I avoided Fishermans Wharf area because it was a real dive the last time I was in the city. Instead, I remembered how central and relatively nice Union Sq was. I read trip advisor reviews and the Handlery seemed to be a good option at the time - plus I managed to get a park and pay deal, which when parking is around $40 a day is a big saving across 4 days.Clearly 7 years is a very very long time. I found the city reversed! Sure Fishermans Wharf is now a not very authentic tourist area but compared to Unions Sq it seemed slightly more pleasant - and generally the hotels were a good deal cheaper. Unions Sq was wall to wall beggars - literally one every 10 feet on the sidewalks and had an overriding stench of urine. I work in London, UK so I'm not exactly immune to city life but this has to be the worst case of vagrancy in any city I have ever visited - and the San Francisco I knew 7-10 yrs ago was nothing like this. Now, I have no idea if this is a real problem, although some guide books advised that the beggars ship themselves in from the suburbs and this is their job. I have no idea but the city needs to do something - both to clear up the city and to help those in need.Anyway, as for the Handlery. Well, the staff were mostly nice although not very helpful - except the guy who worked on the front door, i think he was called a loss prevention officer! He was really great - the only employee in the hotel with an ounce of initiative. He seemed to continually keep an eye out for people who were needing attention and then just help them even though it was clearly not his job. For example, one day the bellhops desk was completely unattended yet he came over, asked us the problem - which was just that we wanted to drop off some laundry (another rant by the way - $4.50 for a pair of underwear? I don't think so!) and off he went with our laundry and came back a minute later with the receipt. I really wish I remembered his name because somebody should give the guy a raise. The concierge on the other hand should be given a talking to - useless and rude.The first room we were given on the 7th floor was tiny, dark and right by the lift shaft - a bit like a cell. I immediately went to the front desk and to their credit they did find us another room on the 10th floor which was nicer - although still a disappointment. I don't know why but the rooms just don't live up to their pictures. It's really weird - we just got our photos back and my husband and I have been showing them to people and they're like what's wrong with it - it looks nice. I agree, it does in the pictures but in the flesh - No. The inch of dust on the skirting board didn't help. The bath towels are the size of what in the UK we call hand towels! Also, I'm sorry but someone needs to tell the hotel that they are based in a city - not having drapes or blackout blinds is insane. The only window covering was a wood slat venetian blind which hung away from the window so people across the way - or indeed the workmen working on the exterior of the building could see inside - not great when you want to get dressed. Plus at night the light streaming in is quite disturbing. Oddly, the noise other people have complained about didn't bother me at all - probably because on the 10th floor we were far removed from it.I definitely won't be going back to this hotel and I would actively recommend against it. Frankly, I'm not sure I'll be heading back to San Francisco any time soon either. Who knows, maybe in 7 yrs it'll be back to the charming city I got to know before.

<Content>excellent location. It was our 2nd stay at this hotel, again we were happy with our stay. When we checked in we requested a quite room, we were allocated over- looking the pool, it was very quite. (our previous trip we were on the front of the hotel and it was very noisy)Nice clean room and i would grade it at a 3*.The hotel has an excellent location just off Union square.

<Content>CITY CENTRE WITH KIDS We stayed at the Handlery for 4 days whilst touring in California with Friends - we had 4 children of ages 17;16;12;12 between us. For a City Centre hotel it was very spacious - we booked the Club rooms which obverlooked the pool and were pleasantly surprised. The hotel was friendly with all staff very helpful. The pool was an added extra which very few City Centre hotels had - the younger kids loved it albeit it wasn't heated and despite really nice, and warm weather it was freezing. The location is very central and easy to get around the whole city - which is very compact - buses, trams, taxis are all very handy. We went on a guided tour of the city shortly after we arrived and it really gave us our bearings and let us know where to head off to explore further. We were very surprised to note that despite us having to cancel the first night of our booked stay at virtually no notice being given to the hotel, due to being delayed overnight in Chicago Airport, we were not charged for the rooms - we fully expected that we would have been. We were advised in advance not to hire a car in SF and this was good advise with car parking being in the region of $30 per day.

<Content>Not Bad, But There Are Better Options About me: 24 years old. Female. American. Traveling with fiance to a convention. From Connecticut, USA.The good stuff:What a great location; right in the center of the city and super close to fabulous shopping.Really comfortable pillows! Oh my gosh! I forgot to look to see what they are, but they were fantastic.NO BAD ARTWORK on the walls! (This is probably a bigger deal to me than most people...) The room decor was really great.Heated outdoor pool! The bad stuff:I noticed that several of our friends, staying within a few blocks of us, had similar hotel rooms for a lot less money and got a lot of nice little service perks with their stay; free breakfast, a complimentary wine reception.Long, dark hallways (which could be bad or a whatever).Room service didn't make our bed all the way one day. The pillows were left on the floor.Kind of noisy where we were on the third floor facing Geary Street.4:30 am on our last day, someone pulled the fire alarm (false alarm)r. We rushed to the lobby thinking it was a fire, and left our room key. After getting clearance to return to our rooms, we asked for another copy by saying Room # and were given one without anyone checking to see if we really belonged to that room. What a great way to scam your way into someone's hotel room!Two traveling business men told us to lock up our valuables because they were robbed.Summary:Not terrible, but there are better places to stay, and we won't be here again.

<Content>Not Great and very noisy Stayed 23 to 25 Sept inclusive.Arrived 10am - Check in fairly quick. Bags stored until room ready after 3.30pm.Room on 7th Floor - Very noisy due to street noise (OK it is in a busy shopping district) A/C was noisier than street noise and essential if you were to breath as bedroom window was sealed and temps were in the 70's. A/c was too noisy!.Hotel is central so good for shopping and close to the Powell/Mason Cable car. Tip go the stand at Powell at busy times for a reasonable chance to get on. Breakfast at Lefty O'Douls four doors down from hotel is better value than Daily Grille.Go to Powell and take the F street car to Fishermans Wharf, very scenic and a lot less crowded than Cable Cars. Lots of panhandlers on the streets.Choose another hotel if you can this one is not great value.

<Content>A Must Stay My boyfriend and I stayed one night at The Handlery Union Square and my only complaint is it was for just the one night. The hotel facade is reminiscent of Manhattan hotels, the staff is very warm and personable, and the rooms are very well appointed. The bed was so comfortable we didn't want to leave it. Another nice feature was the heated pool (pools are hard to come by in S.F.). We had a club room on the 8th floor with a balcony. The view of the Square was to die for! I am a hotel booking agent in San Diego and I will highly recommend The Handlery Union Square to anyone heading for Frisco.

<Content>Return guests We stayed here during the last week of Sept , at the tail end of our trip to the US. We had stayed before but having read some more recent reviews of the property (particularly that of other NZ travellers) we were a little apprehensive. Our apprehension was short lived. We arrived early evening and our room was ready and bed turned down. Check in was a little slow as only one person was on the desk - but as more travellers arrived another person came to assist. We stayed in the club room overlooking the pool as having stayed before we knew our room would be nice and quiet and a little more spacious. The room was very clean throughout our stay. Coffee/tea were replenished daily. We had an ample supply of towels and liked the soft robes. We had a lovely meal in the daily grill one evening and were able to make a reservation for this - having learned from the previous night when there was a very long wait.Whilst the male conceirge was rather aloof - he did make dinner reservations at a restaurant for us, advised us on which half day trip to take and also organised the airport shuttle. A word of warning allow yourself adequate time for uplift of bags if they have been stored for the day as the bell is often away on errands. Same advise regarding the conceirge - we needed to wait almost half an hour for him to return from his break as no one at the front desk was able to help - despite the sign suggesting ask at the desk if the conceirge was not available.Definitely a good location and value for money - we make this comparison based on the accomodation and facilities we had in San Diego on the first part of our trip. The Handlery is in our mind worth a stay if you are prepared to deal with the slightly tempramental elevators - but then again you can always take the stairs.

<Content>Great stay at the Union Sq. Handlery Hotel My husband, myself, my sister in law and her 2 grown daughters all stayed 3 nights here September 27-30, 2006.We were in club room #763 and the 3 girls were in #445. We were checked in right away, the bell person was VERY professional  prompt and their whole check in process was just fine  quick.Our room was just exactly as the web site pictures depict. Bed was VERY comfortable, maid service very good, plenty of towels, supplies, etc. We had a balcony room overlooking the pool which was nice.The concierge seemd to be quite busy every time we went into the lobby, we did not have occasion to use them, but they definitely were being used by other patrons. The bell people were quick to help with anything, really tried hard to get a cab for you, give directions, etc----always with a smile!The restaurant seemed nice, we only had 1 breakfast there  one time we had cocktails  an appetizer--all were good and the service very nice  friendly.This is a fabulous location for shopping, sight seeing, theaters, Chinatown, restaurants and really centrally located for almost everything in San Francisco.We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel in a great location My family of 4 (2 Adults and 13  9 sons)stayed at the Handlery SFO in September 2006 for 4 nights and we all loved it. The hotel is very well set up for children, we had one of the family rooms in the older part of the hotel and it was excellent with the kids having a seperate bedroom without the expense of a seperate room, the lounge area was another bonus. It was my second stay at the Handlery and I have enjoyed it each time.

<Content>We loved the Handlery - Staffordshire, England We stayed at the Handlery August 14th to 19th and thought it was great. We had booked a club room and asked for a high floor if we faced the street (to keep the noise down). We arrived at 12.30am and the receptionist was very helpful and had our bags sent up to our room. The room was large, clean quiet and on the 6th floor. All of the staff were very pleasant and always said hi when they met you. The female concierge was very helpful and gave some great restaurant recommendations - particularly the Mexican across the road. I cannot praise the hotel enough. I thought it was great value and the location is ideal. The negative reviews on this site do not reflect the hotel that we stayed in and should we travel to San Francisco again I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel. The bar next door in the Grill Room was good (the best Cosmopolitan in San Francisco!)

<Content>Excellent Stay at the Handleray We spent 2 nights at the Handleray en route to Hawaii - the first stop on our honeymoon.When we arrived, our room was instantly upgraded, and complimentary Champagne and a welcome basket was waiting for us in our room.We were told that the Hotel Owner wanted to greet us personally, but unfortunately, he wasn't available!The room was first class - spacious, comfortable and very clean.Just minutes away from Union Square, restaurants, theatres trolley buses and cable cars.The staff were friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Would certainly recommend.

<Content>An absolute gem Knowing that the hotel was rated highly in advance we were not disappointed. Efficient staff and fantastic location are key reasons to it's success.Excellent size room and very quiet after dark. We bought breakfast in advance and ate at the connected restaurant in the Hotel which was very good although not that cheap.For 2 days however we went to Lefty O'Driscoll's 3 doors down the road and had a fantastic breakfast much cheaper and with more atmosphere. (If the local cops go there it must be good !)Glad we didn't stay in Fisherman's Wharf which was great fun during the day but not so sure about the evening.Location in Union Square is perfect for the shops and with the bus outside you can get to all the major sites very easily.No doubt we will be back in the next 12 months

<Content>Very disappointed This was the worst hotel we stayed in, in the States - and the most expensive. Our room and bathroom were tiny, the window looked at a concrete wall with rubbish and cigarette butts everywhere. we ended up closing the blind so as not to see it. The fridge was most awkward to get at, with a broken door in front of it. The decor was fine, but it was a most uncomfortable room to stay in. After 2 days we decided to complain, (first time ever) and were finally given a room for the disabled, that was very nice, lots of sun and a big bathroom. Reading the reviews, it appears that there are lots of larger rooms in this hotel, and seeing we had booked several months in advance, I would have thought we may have been given a better room. The staff had trouble understanding us, even though we are New Zealanders and the concierge staff were the worst we have met. They had no pamphlets on display, and had to go to a filing cabinet if you requested tours etc. When asked what there was to do, the answer was, well it all depends what you want to do. Most unhelpful. I said that we had been on a City Tour and the woman replied well you've seen everything. We ended up going to the hotel over the road to get their pamphlets to see what else to do. We spoke to other guests and found that they had also requested another room. We would NEVER advise people to stay at this hotel, and there appeared to be a lot of other hotels in the vicinity that would be well worth considering. So, even though we had a lovely trip to the States, we would have been better to go to San Francisco first, leaving the best till last!

<Content>Location is the only thing going for this hotel. I recently spent one night at this hotel. I travel a lot and usually get what I expect from a hotel due to my extensive research. I was very disappointed with my stay here. A previous poster stated the slow inattentive staff. I had the same experience. I showed up at 3:30. Check in is at 3:00. There were 3 staff members at the desk attending to things on the desk, not attending to guests. I stood there for minutes with a line forming behind me. No one at the desk looked up and even acknowledged us. I finally said hello? and the man in front of me looked up then and asked if I needed something. Unbelievable. It took more time to find out if my room was ready...it was after their posted check in time. I booked a club level room with the expectation of receiving a nicer than standard room accommodation. The room was horrible. The carpeting was covered with dirty stains throughout, windows were dirty, filthy marks on the leather covered chest of drawers. A floor lamp tilting like it was about to fall over at any moment, glaring bare bulbs over the bed with little shades above them that did nothing to cover the bulb. I had to laugh at the makeup lighted mirror on the vanity. They must have found it at some flea market 30 years prior. The room was so noisy from the bar across the street that we couldn't get to sleep until 2:30 am...after the bar closed! The windows on this side of the hotel should definately be double paned. I rarely write uncomplimentary comments on hotel comment cards but this time I let them know about all of this rooms problems. I am pretty tolerant of wear and tear etc. but this was a club level room and I expected it to at least be clean. There are many many hotels in this location so even though this hotel is in a great spot there are too many other nice hotels to choose from to ever make me book here again. I give this hotel 1-2 stars.

<Content>The location makes this hotel. The location of this property is second to none. The rooms were spacious and clean but to us the hotel did not have the WOW! factor as so many other people report. The front desk staff were not at all friendly, not a smile in sight and they were very slow. Most of the time there was only one person on the desk although there were other front desk staff hanging around the back of desk but not dealing with guests. Rather than just explain they were dealing with admin and we wouldn't be kept waiting for long they totally ignored us and this I thought came across as very rude. The pool was OK - not that warm and there were dirty ashtrays and empty drink bottles left on tables. If I was staying in San Fran again I would probably be able to ignore the fact that they have unattentive staff along with the pool issues purely because of the fact that the location is excellent and the rooms are clean and spacious.

<Content>The Handlery Hotel, full of great people We just returned from a week in San Francisco. On the recommendation of a friend we stayed at the Handlery Hotel. It is very convienently located just off Union Square. Could not have been handier to the cable cars, shops, restaurants, and (my husband's favourite) a liquor store. A huge thank you to Rhonda in the gift shop. With the concierge so busy and the line long I went the Rhonda for suggestions on what to see and do. Because she was born and raised in San Fran and obviously has a love of the city, she was a wealth of information. Thanks, Rhonda!!! The rooms are well appointed and huge. The cleaning staff was very efficient and the rooms were made up promptly every day. The only complaint I have is the late check-in. We arrived from out of town at ~1100 and could not get into our room until 1500. They did store our luggage for us, but it would have been nice to freshen up before hitting the streets.I also loved Dale at the concierge desk. He was delightful and very helpful when we had a question.

<Content>Great location We were upgraded to Mini Suite in the Club Rooms - Newer part of the hotel. Room was great. We also asked for a quiet room to avoid Union Sq noise.Hotel is an ideal base for Union Square  access to the local transport systems including the Cable Cars.We have 2, 12 year olds so the fact the hotel had a pool was ideal when returning to the hotel from a day seeing the sights.I also arranged various activities with the hotel concierge prior to  during our visit - great service  offered great advice.Breakfast is served at the Daily Grill next door (access from the hotel lobby). Food is great at Breakfast  Dinner.If we return to SF would certainly book the Handlery again.

<Content>Location, Location, Location The Handlery was an exceptional Hotel. Right on the edge of Union Square in the middle of Downtown. Couldn't ask for a better location. the Hotel staff was friendly and always helpful. Our room was always keep clean and neat. We stayed in the older section of the Hotel in a small but comfortable room. It has been well maintained for its age. Your within walking distance to many attractions including Chinatown, the cable cars and Union Square itself. Dozens of restaurants are also within walking distance. Yes, there were plenty of panhandlers around. But that is true for the entire City. None of them bothered us. If your used to the City this hotel would suit you just fine.

<Content>The best! Surprising! I've never been to San Francisco, and I was hoping to be in a tourist-y spot in the middle of the hustle and bustle- and that's what I got! I didn't need to rent a car at all - and if I wanted to, the rent-a-car places were half a block away. The big stores were right in front of the hotel, and if something wasn't within walking distance, I took the bus or cable car everywhere else.Very helpful concierge and staff and the room we got was small but very, very comfy .. especially the bed! Outside noise did not bother me at all.If you're looking to be in the middle of everything, this is the best location!!

<Content>Very good hotel, excellent location Within 100 yards of Union Sqare, the hotel is right in the middle of it. Cable Car, Chinatown - it is all there. Drawback is that you might feel a bit uncomfortable on the street in the evening (there is a lot of homeless folks around) and parking. To leave you car in the underground garage costs you 40$ per night. They must be very proud of their parking garage. We actually returned the rental car earlier and explored S.F. without it. There were no problems with the hotel whatsoever. The rooms are small, but there is all you need and everything is clean and tidy and the staff was very friendly. There was no breakfast included in the room rate, but around Union Square are plenty of places to get a morning coffee.Though it is not a 5-star place, you get the impression to be in a proper hotel with concierge and so on, and this for ~150 bugs a night in the holiday season. Pretty good, eh?

<Content>Nice hotel Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. Very friendly and helpful staff, had bubbly and mini hamper sent to our room as we were honeymooners and a personal greeting from the owner. Room was comfortable and the hotel was well located. Only down side was the amount of homeless/beggars around the area. a bit daunting at first but learnt to ignore their presence.

<Content>Very nice hotel We stayed at this hotel from 21 July 2006 for 4 nights. We had booked two twin beds in a non-smoking room 7 months prior, however on arrival from London UK, we were told the hotel was way overbooked and they put us on the 8th floor which is a smoking floor/rooms in to the tiniest room you have ever seen. We could hardly move. My son has asthma and was very wheezy all night and we could not stand the smell. The next morning they moved us to the 2nd floor, what an improvement - a huge room atleast double the size. It overlooked a brick wall so that wasnt so good, but was very roomy. Hotel staff were very helpful. Hotel Pool was nice but a bit small and having to use your room towels and then phone housekeeping for more was a bit of a pain. We were surprised at how many homeless people there were in San Fran, and people begging for money. We were even approached for money while sitting at a street cafe having a coffee and felt most uncomfortable. We loved San Fran inspite of this. Hiring bikes and cycling over Golden Gate Bridge was our highlight. The weather was great too - 97f!

<Content>Super location Spent two nights in the Handlery. This is an older hotel but you wouldn't know it from the interior. Very nicely remodeled. The hotel was excellent---great service, very clean and quiet, and right in the middle of all the shops in San Francisco. Plenty of great places to eat nearby. The trolley to Fisherman's Wharf and other locations was a few steps away. I got the Internet package that included parking. Parking is at a premium in SF and is very expensive. Driving around SF is not a pleasant experience so park the car and leave it. Also, be prepared to tip. The hotel has a bellman, valet parking, a concierge, etc. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel and Location - Good Value Stayed at the Handlery following reviews on Tripadvisor. Great location in Union Square, and recommend stayimg in the Club rooms, as had a room on the 8th floor with a balcony overlooking the pool, and views of the city skyline. Room was large, well appointed and clean. The hotel has an excellent restaurant/diner attached 'The Daily Grill', which has a good menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Really friendly, efficient service and steaks! Overall a great place to stay in Union Square in the centre of SF.

<Content>Excellent hotel Stayed here for 5 nights for our 25th wedding anniversary. Ron at reception greeted us very well and offered his congratulations. Gave us a lovely room with balcony overlooking the city. Nice big room with fridge. Weather was lovely and warm when we were there so the pool was great to come back to. We have stayed here before in the standard rooms but the club rooms were well worth upgrading to. Hotel is also in an excellent location. Would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to San Francisco.

<Content>Great value, great deal My wife and I recently stayed in this hotel for one night following a trip to the Wine country. I did a lot of research on hotels in San Fran because the budget and tourist venues can be very uneven and we have been disappointed. I read thru all of these reviews and can recommend the following; Stay in the Club tower of this hotel. We paid 135 a nght (plus tax) and parked down the street in the public Union Square parking lot. (31 a night verses the hotel's 43) The club room was as good as any room I have stayed in including the Grand Hyatt, Pan Pacific, Francis Drake and much better than your typical boutique tourist hotels which have tiny rooms and a cramped feeling. I asked for a balcony room overloking the pool and got a high up seventh floor room with a view of the courtyard. I don't know if an outer room has any better view, but we wanted quiet and were pleased with this option. You won't see much other than the rooftops of other hotels and will get some noise if you are out on the balcony bur inside it is peaceful. I was handled by Shirley, who was totally professional, cheerful and supplied everything I asked for. When there was a delay with our luggage that we had to bring in, an assistant GM actualy hauled our stuff inside and got us in the room in less than five minutes. If you have a lot of luggage just let the bell staff handle it and tip them a few bucks. No worries. I would rate this hotel five stars but that is for a Ritz-Carlton or Bel-Air Hotel type of experience and this is not the same experience (or cost) However the club rooms are quite excellent, a cut above anything I've experienced in the same price range, a dynamite location and well worth the twenty or so more dollars than the older rooms which sound typical. Spend a few dollars more and relax, it's a great place. Did get the daily paper and robes in the new bathroom. Frankly, don't know how anyone could complain about the Club rooms, I would dismiss those comments as curmudgeonly

<Content>Great Value Great Hotel First off I must say the hotel staff are very helpful and assist very often without the need to be asked. The room was very clean and well layed out making best use of the space. The real plus being that this is one of the few hotels I stayed at in the USA that had a fridge that was usable so you could go to the local store and buy water and milk and anythnig else you wanted. All in All this was a great hotel.

<Content>Will definitely stay at the Handlery again. My daughter and I stayed at the Handlery Union Square on a week-end in May. Our room was giant! Two beds, a desk and chair, a large sofa with a table and a cushioned bench with shelf space underneath were all in our room. We also had a walk-in closet big enough to change in as well as a large bathroom. The location was excellent, close to the cable car stop, art galleries, shops and Union Square. The staff was friendly and courteous and even let us check in two hours early. The hotel itself was charming and clean. All this for only $99 on a special rate from TravelZoo.

<Content>It's not the Ritz... But....... If you are looking for accomodations like the Ritz, forget it. However, you cannot beat the Handlery for location and value. I stayed six nights and found it very clean and comfortable, along with an excellent staff. Arrived early and was given an early check-in with no hassle. The person at the front desk was very friendly and accomodating. Room was small but more than adequate for this single traveler. Bed very comfortable! The room could not have been cleaner, and it was serviced right on time every day with plenty of fresh towels and toiletries. The concierge was extremely helpful. Most of all I found the Handlery affordable and the location is superb, close to everything, and the cable car is right around the corner. Try the wonderful restaurant attached to the hotel (Daily Grill). You won't be disappointed!I would definitely stay at the Handlery again.

<Content>Good Location, average hotel, expensive parking We stayed 3 nites in the Historic rooms at the back of the hotel. The rooms were average and clean. We had a rental car as we were going to explore Muir woods etc, however we found the parking at the hotel was over $35per nite which was more then the rental car !. The great thing about the hotel was the location. Right on Union Sq with all the shops and eating places. Great Breakfast just 2 doors from the hotel at a reasonable price.

<Content>We've had better We recently booked two weekend nights at the Handlery Union Square through another site. While the rate was fair enough for a weekend, we have stayed at other comparably priced hotels in the city with much better rooms, cheaper parking, and no issues. It cost us over $70 to park for two nights, while a (quite charming) hotel we had stayed at before about a block away overlooking Union Square had only charged $25 per night. (The only reason we did not go back to the other one is because it had no availability.)The room was fairly small, which is average for San Francisco. The pillows were reminiscent of bubble pack mailers covered with a pillow case -- rather thin. But the thing that annoyed me the most is that the designer comforter had a stain on the underneath when we pulled it back to go to sleep. With no way of knowing whether it had been laundered, and being late at night, we just removed the comforter altogether.The next day I specifically left a note on top of the stain asking housekeeping to take care of it. Yet, when we went to bed that night, there it was. They had ignored the request! Again, it was late in the evening, so we just tossed it aside. Sorry, but we don't want to sleep with somebody else's DNA if we can help it, but we're not so cranky to complain to the desk clerk at midnight!When I checked out I notified the front desk and got a rather weak sorry about that; they shouldn't have done that with no explanation or offer of any consideration. I think that they could have offered to credit us with a portion of our parking or even a minor (10%?) discount on the room. At the very least, they should have notified the general manager and asked him/her to extend an apology.I don't think we would go there again based on that lack of customer service. Maybe if we had arrived in a Jaguar we might have been treated differently.

<Content>Great location, otherwise just OK No argument - the Handlery's got a prime location literally steps from the corner of Powell and Geary, just opposite Union Square. And the hotel is, overall, a very nice, clean, well-maintained, modern place. I'd return (mostly for the prime location), but I'd skip the extra $ for a Club room; ours was average size and its window was directly opposite the window in a building about six feet across an alley, which appeared to be a waiting room or something, so we hardly ever opened the drapes. We didn't get the promised daily newspaper - one of the two enhanced amenities I was most interested in receiving. And on the first day of our stay, our room had still not been cleaned by 3:00 p.m. Also, it's important to know that the Club-level rooms are actually in a separate building that faces O'Farrell, linked to the main hotel by a stairway and the pool deck. If you have heavy luggage, as I did, you're either at the mercy of the very, very, very persistent bellhops (I despise bellhops) OR you have to carry your suitcase up three short flights of stairs. (I have no idea how they accommodate somebody in a wheelchair who wants a Club room, although since the bellhops are probably not carrying all that luggage up the steps, there must be a SECRET elevator somewhere that only the staff is permitted to use.) This is SO bogus! SO, yes, stay at the Handlery, but don't go for the Club room upgrade. It is simply more trouble than it's worth. (PS the plaza at Union Square is a free wireless hotspot - skip the Handlery's $10/day in-room wireless charge and enjoy the California sunshine for free!)

<Content>Great place to stay In the last week of August I took my two teenage sons on a week-long trip to San Francisco. As always, I did a lot of research about the city, the attractions, places to eat and stay. I decided on Handlery primary because it fit my budget, the location seemed great, and photos on the website were pretty nice. We were not disappointed at all. Our room, the Club style, was large, clean and very comfortable. It was on the 7th floor in the newer building, facing towards Market Street and the bottom of Powell Cable Car Station (in a distance). It was a little noisy by early morning, but we really did not care about it, as beds were oh, so comfy. The room was always cleaned-up by the time we were back, the bathroom was also re-filled with soaps, shampoos, etc. For breakfast we would go to Lefty's (next door), and the wait time never exceeded 5 minutes, even though the place was always busy, even at 08:00 am. Service was also pretty good. One of the days we went for breakfast to Dotty's Blue Cafe (recommended in few books and on few websites), about 20 min walk. The wait was about 35 min, but sure it was worth every second. Also close to the hotel, and another great place to eat (dinner this time) was Sears restaurant, located just up the Powell St. Overall Handlery with its location was an excellent choice, and I would definatly recommend it.

<Content>quirky yet great Initially thrown off by our small room, with mis-matched 1970's furniture/decor, and a view of a vent. Remembered we鈥檇 only paid $109 per night and realized the room was big enough (had a king bed, chair, ottomon, table, closet, good-sized bathroom and still some space). Was very clean and all decor/furniture was in excellent condition. Bathroom was very nice, bed comfortable, location excellent, facilities (business center/concierge) excellent, outdoor pool area lovely (if cold). Can pay $40 more to get a 鈥渃lub room鈥?(little larger and more modern), but we loved our quirky room. Didn鈥檛 dine there, went to Chinatown/Russian Hill鈥?br/>

<Content>Clean, Clean, Clean After much research and reviews on TripAdvisor, myself and 2 friends decided to stay here. We were not disappointed. We stayed in Room # 769, which is at the end of the hall. The room had 2 queen-size beds and overlooked the pool. It was very clean -- and that says alot coming from the hotel snob as my family and friends so sweetly refer to me. The beds were very comfortable, the room was quiet, and the refrigerator came in handy for sodas and water. We had no complaints whatsoever. Besides the room being so clean, what we appreciated was the massive vanity that is outside the bathroom area. For 3 women sharing a room and trying to get ready for the day at the same time, this was a wonderful surprise! There was a bench to set on and a makeup mirror on the vanity along with the wall mirror that was the length of the vanity. Towels were clean and the soaps/shampoos were nice too. Although the weather was too cool to use the pool, it certainly looked inviting. As was suggested on previous reviews, we chose to eat breakfast next door at Lefty's. The food was good and service was fast. We caught a cable car on Powell Street, which is less than 1 block away. And it was only a short walk to where we could purchase the cable car tickets. If you don't have much luggage, I would suggest taking the BART from the airport to Powell Street (cost for 1 way to Powell Street is $5.15) instead of a taxi ride which is $40 one way! You can get off the BART (about a 25 minute ride from the airport) at the Powell Street exit which is inside the mall. Walk out the front door of the mall and you are on Powell Street facing the site where you purchase tickets for the cable cars. From there it is only a few blocks walk to the hotel. Would probably be inconvenient to take the BART from the airport if you had more than one piece of luggage to pull, but certainly beats the price of a cab. Overall the hotel was exactly what we needed and most importantly to us it was clean and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again (and will ask for this room if it is available) during my next trip to San Francisco.

<Content>Great location, average hotel We stayed at the Handlery for three nights as the first stop on an extended vacation late last year. It was booked by our travel agent in New Zealand as he recommended it as the hotel he always used on visits to San Francisco.The location on this hotel cannot be bettered, right om Union Square. The hotel is old but seemed to be well maintained. We had a regular room which was adequate, if we stay there again we would upgrade to a Club room. The staff were courteous rather than friendly. We did not eat there so cannot comment about the bar or restaurant.ON our final night the fire alarm went off at 3.00am, it was no false alarm as we could smell the smoke as we trooped down the stairs. The evacuation proceeded smoothly although no staff were in evidence. After some milling about in the street next do we were allowed to move into the function room fo the Four seasons opposite. As it happened the fire was in the hotel next door but it was two hours before we were let back into our rooms. The hotel did put on free beakfast for every one which was a nice thought. Moral of the story MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHERE THE FIRE EXITS AREOverall I would say that this hotel has a great location, average facilities and is value for money

<Content>Great romantic stay My husband and I stayed a night at this hotel Saturday, Feb 18th. We purchased their romance package which included Champagne and chocolates at check-in, breakfast in bed and a late checkout. We could have checked out as late as 2pm. The front desk was great for check-in, quickly answering all questions and the valet service was very quick upon entering and exiting. The room was clean and roomy, king size bed with sofa, chair and coffee table. We enjoyed the little extras in the club room: robes, lighted vanity mirror, in room tea and coffee, and shoe buffer (even a scale in the bathroom, but I avoided it). Our only complaint about the room was the lumpy pillows. The loud bachelorette party coming through the hall at 2:30 didn't even bother me because a year and a half ago I was the bride at one of those loud bachelorette parties staying in a suite at the Handlery.The location of this hotel is great. Very close to shopping, one block from Union Square. We walked most places or caught a cab right out front. Enjoy your stay.

<Content>Best Spot and deal on Union Square I spent my birthday night at this hotel and was amazed at the room size and value here. We had 5 rooms total in the historical building only one of those rooms were average in size! All the rest were quite large with excellent amenities. I was totally surprised by the silence in the hallways. Usually older hotels are noiser than more modern cement hotels. But you truly did not hear a sound coming from other rooms. Room service was quick and efficient! The place even has an outdoor pool. There is also a New tower for those of you that want the more modern Chain hotel feeling! I highly recommend it!!

<Content>Great hotel - why are people complaining??!! We have just returned form an 8 night stay at the Handlery - and cant believe people are moaning about this hotel! We did stay in a club room - and they are of a very good size and i think the regualr rooms are quite a bit smaller - but this is the norm for San Francisco!!! Plus in the Club you get bath robes, extra bathroom amenities, fridge - prob not very important things but it adds to the stay. The rooms are nicely decorated too, and clean! Cant really rememeber any staff been rude (apart from one of the Valet guys so all we did was give a tip to the nice polite valet instead!)- but in all honesty its not something i really take into consideration when booking a hotel - I think far more important is location and considering this hotel is a stones throw from Union Square, is it really that important that the staff arent kissing your preverbial??!!!  Next time I visit I know exactly where I will be staying!!

<Content>Great Location - Nice Boutique Hotel My family - 2 adults and 3 kids (aged 11, 8 and 7) just spent 4 nights at the Handlery Hotel - we had a family suite which consisted of 2 rooms (1 double and 1 queen sofa and 2 single beds connected by a bathroom). Plenty of room and great central location. San Francisco is a very busy city and we visited during the thanksgiving long weekend - right during the start of the pre christmas sales so the city was very busy.We found the hotel to be very well located and so long as you tipped the staff (front office, bellman and concierge you rec'd good service). But that is the case in all the hotels we stayed in during our 24 night trip to the California/Hawaii).This hotel is very handy to shops, like Macy's etc and transportation (many options).Don't eat at Lefty O'Douls next door - the wait staff are really rude!!

<Content>Take the Good with the Bad...... My husband and I just got back yesterday from spending 4 nights at the Handlery Hotel. I had read the TripAdvisor reviews before booking through my travel agent, and we hummed and hawed about staying at one of the pricier hotels, (since my husband is all about the 5 stars), but I finally convinced him to try this one since I knew we knew we wouldn't be spending much time in the room, and the extra $$ would be better spent on nice dinner's and shopping. First of all, if you are going to stay there, pay the extra (which isn't that much) and stay in a Club Section Room. Ask for the quiet section overlooking the pool. Our room was 767, and quite frankly we were very comfortable in it. Don't book a room at the Handlery if you want a Luxury Hotel. It is not like that, so if you're going with comfort and functionality in mind, you will not be disappointed. The bed was comfortable and the in-room amenities were useful (bathrobes, fridge, and vanity area). Overall the staff were helpful, although one person in particular, Shirley, went above and beyond to provide great service to us. The location is amazing, and you are a stone's throw from the cable cars, restaurants, and amazing shopping. The Daily Grill has a great lunch menu and Lefty's was our favourite for breakfast, and if your nice to any one of the Handlery staff they will give you tickets for juice with breakfast. The dinner possibiliites are endless around that area, but try to make reservations earlier in the day, or the day before you want to go.If we were to visit San Francisco again, we would probably stay somewhere else, but only because we like to try different things, not because the Handlery wasn't a good hotel.P.S. If you are going to visit Alcatraz, book your tickets online, ahead of time. You may not get on if you wait until the day of. (Here is the site we found extremely helpful when planning our trip)[--]

<Content>Very average hotel in superb location Stayed 4 nights at the beginning of November after 3 nights in Las Vegas. Arrived at hotel and requested non smoking quiet room, we were given a tiny double room at top of building which stunk of smoke, went back to reception and he then moved us to another double room on 3rd floor which was slightly larger, smoke free but not enough room to turn in the bathroom and really dark and old fashioned. Again we went back to reception and asked about Club Rooms which I had read about on web site, he let us have a look at one and we took it. It was a lot better than the others, the room itself was big with a very comfortable bed and overlooked the swimming pool. The bathroom again left a lot to be desired and was very small but we had a small dressing area outside it so overcame that problem.The common areas of the hotel away from reception look pretty worn and tatty. The concierge was the most unhelpful person I know he did not seem to know what was going on anywhere or be able to advise on anything we wanted to know.  The restaurant next door called Daily Grill serves some good food and not too pricey and always busy with good atmosphere. If you want a real American blow out breakfast suggest you go to Mama's by Washington Square. Overall the location is excellent you are right by all the transport and shops but the hotel is very average and not what we expected from an American hotel.

I should state that at checkout I met a front desk staff member named Shirley who was so lovely... she deserves a promotion.. ALL other staff were unfriendly, rude and unhelpful... Housekeeping was quite poor, the same piece of cardboard remained on my sink for entire stay....

<Content>Fantastic Location Just returned from a week in San Francisco, staying at the Handlery Hotel.Fantastic location, being very close to Union Square, China Town, all of the major shops, the Underground (BART) and the cable car to Fishermans Wharf. You can take a train from the airport, to Powell Street station for $4.95 (then walk up 2 blocks to the hotel), saving a huge amount on cab fares! As the weather was so pleasant, we frequently walked all the way back to the hotel from Fishermans Wharf, taking in all of the sights along the way.When we first arrived, we were given a small room overlooking Geary Street, which proved to be extremely noisy (street performers, dust carts, sirens etc. etc.) So after a sleepless night we asked if we could move, which was no problem at all. The very helpfull staff at reception moved us to a much larger room overlooking the pool area, which we found to be excellent (considering what we paid and the fact that the hotel is only a 3*).In terms of eating, there are some fantastic 'diner' type places all within 5mins walk of the hotel or you can wander into China Town or even through to Little Italy where you will find some excellent restaurants.Overall, we loved San Francisco and thought that the hotel was very good, considering the price and location. We would stay at the Handlery again.

<Content>Old  We have just returned from a 2 week trip to USA - very disappointed in Handlery Hotel in San Francisco. It was most expensive hotel we stayed in in USA  the worst.The room was nothing like we had been quoted when booked online then they upgraded us to a Deluxe room which consisted of 2 x QS beds, very tired furniture, very noisy old air conditioner, very small bathroom  1 window which looked at a brick wall !! The staff were all foreigners  we had great difficulty understanding each other. Only good point is the close proximity to Union Square

<Content>Club Room a Must! Our group had 3 rooms at this hotel - one standard room and 2 club rooms. We got a great deal at Travelzoo for the rooms which was why we decided to stay here. The club room was large and clean and had a balcony with chairs and a table overlooking the street. Street noise was not a problem when the balcony doors were closed. However, maintenance seemed to be a problem - the shoe polishing machine in our room did not work and the coffee machine took 45 minutes to brew. In my friend's club room, she stepped on a carpet nail that was poking up and hurt her foot. Our friend in the standard room hated it - her room was cramped and dark.To get to reception from the valet parking was a journey involving an elevator and multiple stairs. Be prepared for that if you've got luggage or mobility issues. And watch out for the hotel parking charges - $35 a night!!The service at the front desk was indifferent, but not rude. The location is great to access the theater district, the aquarium, union square shopping and China Town. Basically, it was an ok hotel for the price I paid (about $120/night). If I had paid more for it I would have been quite disappointed.

<Content>Hot and cold! We were on a five night stay at the Handlery whilst attending a conference. The location was nice and central which was great for my husband as he was left to his own devices for a few days, and he loved roaming the city on foot, and also took in a couple of tours.Check-in was efficent and we were given a nice sized clean room, however, we were right on Geary Street and couldn't sleep the first two nights because of the noise. They were unable to move us until the third day because they were full, but as soon as a room became available, we checked into another room which was slightly bigger and alot quieter. (I was also with a colleague who complained his room was unbelievably small!).Housekeeping was friendly, the lady that ran the gift shop was rude and uninterested, and for the main part this was also true for most of the staff at reception. Upon checkout I waited 10 minutes whilst two ladies were dealing with two people in front of me, and then they both totally ignored me and meandered on through the door behind reception - I was just left standing there! My husband said I had my invisible cloak on! Waited another couple of minutes and just walked out. I think enough said about the service of this hotel! Consider yourself warned if service is important to you - the attitude of the staff sucks!

<Content>Family owned with bad employee attitudes...so bad! The rooms are okay. For the amount of money asked, the rooms are not up to par with other hotels around. The front desk employees attitudes are very unprofessional and downright rude. We are talking 3 different employees. When talking to GM Jon Handlery about the problem. He passed it off to lesser manager. The next day same bad attitude. Not what you should deal with from a small family run hotel. Find another hotel. I did after checking out early.

<Content>Over rated!! My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights with our 2 year old son, having seen a review of it on the Holiday Programme (BBC TV) and can only say what a complete disappointment it was. The rooms were extremely small, dark and not at all sound proofed - again street entertainers kept us awake. Really not worth the rates and would not recommend it to anyone. The staff were quite unhelpful and although we changed rooms immediately after squeezing into the first room the second one we were given was really no better!The only positive to this experience was the excellent restaurant downstairs.

<Content>Everything wonderful -- except the ability to sleep! Everything about this property is wonderful. It's a location close to a lot, the room as updated and well appointed, the beds are very comforable....Well, everything expect the ability to sleep. At 5:00 am construction began on the street below the hotel. It was so LOUD it made sleeping impossible. Now I know there's nothing the hotel can do about construction equiptment and a jack hammer outside the building....but please, an actual jackhammer right outside makes sleeping impossible.

<Content>Great location, Great Service, Great Stay We had an excellent 2 night stay at the Handlery last week. We found the staff to be polite and efficient. We stayed in the club section (room 462 right by the elevator). The room was clean and large. We had the parking package and found that this was quite convenient. We would definately stay there again!

<Content>Bit disappointed First of all, the staff at this hotel were excellent and helpful/friendly, and could not be faulted- bell boys can offer vouchers for Leftys and Macys. We were on honeymoon and the hotel left us some nice wine and munchies on our arrival, which was nice after a long haul flight. Hotel is excellent location if you like the hustle/bustle and shops.What let it down was the room- although it had all the facilities, we were in the historic bit facing Geary St and we found the decor a bit dreary and the noise annoying- expecially from street performers at night - it didn't really feel special given we were on honeymoon. Apparently the club rooms are better, so if you can afford this it may be a lot better/quieter.San Francisco is beautiful- especially by Fisherman's Wharf- if we went again we would stay in this area as it has a much more relaxed/holiday feel to it. We went on the Gray line trolley bus tour of the city for 28 dollars, and this was excellent- Presidio and Fort Point are lovely with good views of the Golden Gate bridge. Also had a tour of Muir woods and Sausalito, which was brilliant. Buy a 3 day trolley pass from the concierge.Foodwise- the Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macys is a must- it is always busy but they have a pager system meaning you only have to wait 10/15 mins for a table. Also had an excellent Chinese banquet for 12 dollars at Chef Hung's in Chinatown- go through the gate and it's about 1/2 mile in on a road to the left. The Rainforest cafe at Fisherman's Wharf was good fun for the experience and had huge portions- as does everywhere in the US.Shopping wise we found Chinatown and the Wharf to be cheapest- shops around Union Sq are quite expensive, although we loved Macys- especially the Xmas shop- wow. Overall we had a great time and would definitely visit San Francisco again.

<Content>Great Price, Great Location, A Little Musty! I searched high and low for a budget-friendly hotel in Union Square and ultimately decided on the Handlery based on the TripAdvisor reviews. For $139, the location can't be beat! It is less than a block from Union Square and surrounded by restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. There is a booth in Union Square where you can buy discounted theatre tickets and multi-day passes for the public transit. We bought a 3-day pass and it was well worth it. We were just a few blocks away from hopping on a cable car or bus when we didn't feel like walking the hills. For being such a large city, this area was incredibly clean and everyone we came in contact wth was friendly and helpful. There are street performers and homeless people everywhere, but they aren't agressive. If you want to be in the heart of the city, but don't want to blow your entire travel budget on a hotel, the Handlery is a great choice. Our biggest complaint was an old, musty smell in the hallways and in our room when we first arrived. We picked up some Febreze and a 99 cent candle at the Walgreen's up the street and it didn't bother us again. There's nothing special about this hotel, but I rated it a 4 because of the great location and the great price.

<Content>Beware of mascurading hotels! We were booked into this hotel in October, it appears not to be the same hotel in the other reviews. The staff of the hotel that we stayed in were surly and unhelpful The non smoking room of the hotel that we stayed in was in fact a smoking room (hiding the ashtray in a drawer does not make a smoking room non) The clean room of the hotel that we stayed in was dirty, contained suspicious stains and was very smelly. We lasted half an hour before we checked out. Do yourself a favour - spend an extra $20.00 and stay in the Sir Francis Drake, which is just around the corner and has an excellent restaurant. Better still give San Francisco a miss -very overrated- and stay in Boston instead!

<Content>First but hopefully not the last Stayed here for four nights as part of a 25th wedding anniversary tour of the west coast of USA, the location is perfect for shopping and is on the main cable car route down to the pier areas,we purchased a multi pass for the cars and could have spent all four days riding them,the entertainment value of the drivers and brakemen was worth the price alone, we ate breakfast in Lefty's which is two doors down, see one of the bellmen for free juice tickets (his wife works there)great entertainment in Lefty's every evening also, if you like beer, it works out a lot cheaper if you buy a pitcher rather than a pint,we had a walk around every evening and found the surrounding area safe, we got the occasional homeless person approach us but they never caused us any concern, on the Saturday night we were there almost all the street corners had musicians playing all sorts of music, all in all a fabulous four days and if we are lucky enough to return we will be staying at the Handlery for sure

<Content>Great location and would recommend it Stayed at the Handlery in Sept 05 and couldn't fault it.The room was clean and a fair size.The hotel desk staff were obliging and polite and the porter provided helpful hints and advice as we were walking out for the day.The Hotel is located just meters from Union square and the cable car.Breakfast at Lefty o'Doulls is a must.....even the hotel porter recommended it ahead of the hotel's dining room!It is located next to the hotel and has the best valued breafast around.My kids ate all and that's saying something.For example a stack of 3 large pancakes for $4.00.We ate breakfast there every morning.We would definitley stay at the Handlery again.

<Content>A great find! We stayed at this hotel during Fleet Week Oct 8th. 2005 and it was a last minute booking via an online website. The rate was excellent considering it was 3 days before our arrival. I loved the location steps from Union Square, the quality of the furnishings, the helpful staff. Our room was on the 2nd. floor facing the hotel's air conditioning vents which meant we had to close the blinds all the time. No matter, the room itself was tastefully furnished, clean and the in-room fridge, iron  coffee-maker very convenient. Ate breakfast at Lefty O'Douls twice. Also ate their great hand-carved roast beef sandwiches for lunch. Would not hesistate to stay there again.

<Content>Good hotel in a good location This hotel is located just off Union Square and is a perfect base to discover San Francisco. Our room was on the 6th floor and it was absolutely fine. Two double beds, plenty of space, a safe, proper closet, tv, etc, etc. The room was clean and we had no problems whatsoever on that front. The staff were all very friendly.There is a restaurant joined to the hotel, which we didn't eat at so I can't tell you about that. We had breakfast at an Irish pub called Lefty O'Doul's just two doors down from the hotel which was convenient. You can also have evening meals and drinks there. We had a couple of drinks at the bar round the corner, where there is live music every evening.I would definitely recommend this to people looking for a good, clean and budget-friendly place to stay in the heart of San Francisco.

<Content>Great Comfort in heart of the city This is the second time I have stayed at the Handlery and it never fails to delight. Rooms are on the small side but beautifully decorated, furnished, comfortable and very clean. The staff are friendly and helpful, and you are just a few steps away from Union Square and some great shopping. Bearing in mind all of this, prices are excellent value. So many hotels in San Francisco are disappointing, noisy and smelly (in my experience) this is great, wouldnt hesitate to recommend it!

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at the Handlery Just returned from a 5 day stay. The rooms were spacious, hot water was plentiful, the beds were comfortable, sheets were changed daily (without our asking), all in all a very enjoyable stay. The reason I don't give them an Excellent is due to items mentioned in previous reviews, namely the noise. We were in Club rooms on the 2nd floor, and while the street noise was present it wasn't horrible to the point wear we needed to change rooms. Although my wife tells me that somewhere nearby they were collecting garbage at 5:30am. If you are looking for a quiet stay request a view of the pool. As others have mentioned, we ate at Lefty O'Douls and we were not disappointed. Cheap and delicious breakfast, and we received free juice coupons from a member of the bellstaff. The inroom fridge came in handy for storing drinks purchased from the nearby grocery store and Walgreen's.If you are looking to tour the city I would highly recommend Great Pacific Tour Company. www.greatpacifictour.com Our tour guide Doug was so knowledgeable of the city that I was shocked when he said he had only lived their for only 14 years.

<Content>Great location and value Just spent one night at the Handlery near Union Square. We were in the old part of the hotel but it was fine and a good value. In-room coffee and frig is a plus for us. Room was super clean and not too noisy. I think any older hotel in this location will have some noise as it's right near a very busy area. The proximity to Union Square is great. We ate at Lefty's for both breakfast and dinner are were very happy. Nothing fancy but great food. Parking is available at the rear of the hotel and they allow in-and-out for no charge for hotel guests and their rate was one of the lowest in the area. My only complaint would be that sometimes there is a bit of a wait at the bell desk to check or collect your bags. Once someone shows up they are usually quick to their task.

<Content>Great family package with free parking This hotel was recommended for family travel and there were lots of families with young kids. We were one of them. I'm not saying that this wouldn't be an ideal location for a honeymoon or romantic weekend, but there is a lot that this hotel offers to families and I was thrilled to have read this on a website. It's a great hotel for everyone. We requested the family package on the club floor. Our room was huge!!! Quite a surprise from all the other hotels that I've stayed in in S.F. We drove from Colorado to S.F., and the package included FREE valet parking with in and out service. Quite a deal! Have you seen the cost of parking in S.F.?Our mission was to Shop and sightsee. My husband had a seminar at the Mark Hopkins and the Union Square location was perfect for all of us. We had a great time going to ALL the retail stores and had an easy time walking to China Town and heading down to the wharf on the Cable car. We chose not to go with the breakfast package with all the reviews about the restaurant and instead went to Lefty's. The concierge even gave us some coupons for Free orange juice. Everyone at the hotel was pleasant and professional. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. We had a room that faced the pool (we requested one before our arrival after all the noise complaints we read...and even confirmed our request) and NEVER heard any street noise or pool action. We did have to walk quite far to get to the room...but we just considered it part of the journey. We took taxis a couple of times and it was never a huge expense to get to parts of town that we didn't want to walk to. We always felt safe and never had a problem with any of the locals. It was an amazing experience and the Handlery Union Square made it very easy for us!

<Content>Lovely hotel, great location Stayed here for 3 nights in August.Great hotel in a good location. Had Club rooms which were worth the extra. Very large. clean with good bathrooms. Did get noise from the street but it is hard to believe that you wouldn't get noise where ever you stay in the city centre.Great eating places close as everybody says Leftys is the best value for breakfast.Very handy for the shops and getting round the city.Loved SF can't wait to come back, hopefully without the fog and will stay at the Handlery

<Content>Excellent hotel and location Stayed here with my wife for 5 nights in early August. Had stayed here last year and was very happy with it. Got a complimentary upgrade this year to one of the lounge section rooms. Huge room overlooking O'Farrell Street. Not much noise from street. Breakfasts next door at Daily Grill were great. Hotel is in a fantastic location next to Union Square. Overall, we loved the Handlery.

<Content>Good but, This hotel is good but, is really just a place to rest your weary siteseeing head! Essential you ask for a Club Room. the pool is nice but the weather doesn't really make you want to dive in for a swim. Breakfast a bit of a nightmare unless you have it in your room because the wait is so long. Suggest you go two doors down to Lefty O'Doulls. Reception a bit brusque but OK.

<Content>Nice Place Right what can i say this hotel is right near union square. We stopped in the club section which was good the noise did not bother us and we stayed on the 8th floor with balcony view. The staff were good and very helpful and did not mind us bringing food back to our room. The room itself was a good size with 2 queen beds which were very comfy and the bathroom was not a bad size either and very clean. The 1st night we got there the TV remote did not work 2 mins latter someone was at our door and change the handset no problems.The places i went for breakfast were Lefties which is next door to the daily grill only 2 doors down from hotel and 2 blocks back up Geary St a cafe called the Olympic Cafe which has big portions and is very cheap. There is a grocery store up from the hotel on the corner which is run by some guys who are italian and love to talk about about Football in the UK and dont mind you watching live matches (which they have on Sky TV) in the store and for places to eat in the evening just go to Jack In The Box up from the hotel which is cheap and 2 or 3 doors up from that there is a Pizza place where they do 16 inch Pizza's which was well worth the money. See Ya James

<Content>If you love being there If you love being there, right in the middle of it, and still feel that you have a retreat and you want all of this at reasonable rates, then this is the SF hotel for you. We - 2 adults, one kid - stayed for four nights in a room on fourth floor not facing the street. The room was not very large but very comfortable, clean and in good taste. I loved the style of the hotel - it harks back to the 1930s maybe and is cozy with thick carpets. All of it is very clean and looks new.And when you step out of the hotel you're really in the middle of it, just off Union Square, with everything within walking distance or easy reach using public transport. Cafes, Restaurants and Bars abound, and even Chinatown is just a few blocks away.Being in the middle of it of course means that you do hear the occasional police car wailing by at night, but that never really bothered us. We felt safe an comfortable there, cared for by helpful staff. We really loved the style!

<Content>Disappointed Booked this hotel for 5 nights following reviews on Trip Advisor. My wife and I arrived late evening and was greeted by a non too pleasant gentleman on reception. Said very little with no real welcome given. Allocated room No. 262 in the Club section. Bit of a walk to get to room but it was nice and spacious, clean and tidy. However, we got very little sleep as room directly on O'Farrell Street at rear of hotel. Busy throughout night and refuse collected, noisily, during the night.In the morning we requested a room change and aided by a helpful receptionist we were reallocated to a room overlooking the pool - noise level greatly reduced.We would recommend that you avoid rooms overlooking O'Farrell Street i.e. rooms ending 60, 62, 64, 66 and 68 on each floor. The quiet rooms overlook the Pool.Incidentally we were not the only people to request a room change - we heard of a few requests during our stay.We arranged a room with breakfast package but found on arrival that it was restricted in value - this was not pointed out on our confirmation. We found the Daily Grill very inconsistant on quality and service and after 3 days gave up and looked elsewhere. Didn't have far to look - found an excellent diner round the corner on Mason Street called Cafe Mason - food excellent and staff friendly and helpful. Max's across Geary Street also good.Location of hotel is ideal if you want to concentrate on shopping, but if its sightseeing you want, suggest you locate nearer Fishermans Wharf where all the tourist action is. Hotel close to cable car line and turnaround but large lines waiting to get on throughout the day.If you want to do Alcatraz, suggest you prebook on the internet as this trip is very popular and books up very quickly. We had to line up for tickets at 7.30am for any cancellations as next available tour was a week in advance. Fortunately we were successful and the trip was great. The city tour by sightseeing tours (gray line) was excellent.Lots of beggars around the Union Square area. Concierge and bell staff helpful.Overall we were disappointed with the quality and felt it necessary to submit this review which hopefully will assist any future travellers to San Francisco.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Service at any price To make a long story short, I have always stayed at four and five star hotels. Recently I had a terrible experience at a major upscale hotel paying $500/night. I decided to stay here based on the reviews/price and was not disappointed.There was a mix up with my room type when I arrived. They handled it ASAP and made me feel as if they really cared. None of that indifferent snobby stuff. They were very professional and responsive. I checked out but couldn't get a flight out; called Handlery to extend my stay. They were booked solid but somehow accommodated me.. I requested some personal items because my bags were on the plane home. The items were in my room before I got there. Again great service. Manny at the front desk was AWESOME! Everything I read that was positive was true. I stayed in the Club area. The room facing the street was perfect for me. The view was great. But yes it is noisy so if you are a light sleeper, choose the pool view instead. I had a choice of getting a room with a balcony, but choose to stay in the room with the sliding glass doors that brought the outside directly into the sitting room area. The decor in the club area was better than the candid photos shown. It had gold/tan tones and much bigger. The bathroom had neutral marble tile and could compete with hotels with higher ratings.Lefty's is the best place to get breakfast in the area. Better food and atmosphere for half the price, don't make the mistake I did. Try Lefty's first. Daily Grill has great steaks.Stay here you will not be disappointed.

<Content>First Class Hotel Stayed at The Handlery with my wife and two teenage kids for 5 nights. We asked for and got interconnecting rooms, one with a double bed the other twin beds. Both rooms were large and well equipped. The bathrooms were of a reasonable size.The hotel was very clean and well decorated throughout. We made good use of the swimming pool and sauna during our visit.The hotel Grill Bar was great for a well earned drink after a long days sightseeing and the restuarant provided an excellent evening meal.The staff were always helpful and the conceirge provided excellent advice as to other good places to eat and visit. We had breakfast in 'Lefties' right next door, excellent food at a good price.The Handlery is very well situated in the Theatre District just yards from Union Square, giving good access to shops and the Cable Cars.Only negative was the price of parking - $36 overnight - but I learnt there were other much cheaper alternatives very close by.During our vacation we stayed at 5 different hotels on the West and East Coast and this was the best all round Hotel. An excellent Hotel which I would not hestitate to visit again or recommend to others.

<Content>Fine location- alright for the money This hotel is in a great location, perfect for the cable car and shopping in Union Square. The hotel front desk has had a big queue each time I have been in reception so check in took a bit of time, then we were told there were no king rooms but after waiting patiently that was dealt with and a room was found.We had a standard room, clean, fairly small but comfortable. Rooms have clearly been renovated, I felt the decor was a bit mismatched but I think that may just be my taste. Swimming pool is a nice addition. Housekeeping do a good job of making the extremely comfortable bed up. However the remote control went missing inexplicably after the bed has been made and it took an hour for someone to replace it which I think is bad service.We opted for the wireless internet service for our stay... connection is terrible, I wouldn't recommend it. Hotel parking is 36 dollars a day.In terms of location though, its very good and not too expensive we paid 139 dollars a night with Hotels.com.

<Content>great hotel - go there stayed for 4 nights in july 2005 with family (912 yrs old) at handlery hotel.rate was 189 USD a night including parking.this hotel is just perfect.we had a nice room (club section) on upper floor with a view on the outdoor pool.the room is in perfect shape. decent size. very comfortable beds and pillows. no problem with the noise we all slept like babies.the outdoor heated pool is a great plus for san francisco. the pool is quite large and we all enjoyed it a lot.the hotel is very nicely located, one block away from the cable car terminal and any other public transportation.i would not hesitate a minute to come back.for breakfast, i would recommend that you go to lefty o`douls restaurant located two houses next to the hotel. the breakfast there is just great at a very decent price.Montrealer2

<Content>Great Location Stayed at the Handlery Union 29th June 2005 because of the reviews on this website and it was exactly as the reviews had suggested. It was in a great location. Handy for the shops, cable car, restaurants and theatres. Staff at reception were great and the conciege were very helpful giving us tips on where to eat, info on the cable cars and giving us maps to get to places and back to the hotel by car. Didn't use the hotel parking as we found the public car parks in O'farrell Street were cheaper and very close.Had breakfast at Lefty's every morning which was great with a good atmosphere.My sons 18 and 20 used the hotel pool at the end of the day which was great after a busy day sightseeing. We were given a quiet room as requested at the back of the hotel which was a club room and had plenty of room for 4 adults staying. The bathroom was very small, that was my only complaint but the room was very well decorated and the beds were very comfortable. All in all it lived up to its reputation as a small family run hotel in the heart of downtown San Francisco.

<Content>Great Location in Union Square I have no complaints about this hotel!! First and foremost, it's in a GREAT location in Union Square. It's close to everything. Shopping, restaurants, bus stops, cable car stops. This is great for those of you who don't have a car! The price is right too! I highly recommond getting a CLUB room, especially if you have more than 2 in your party. The regular rooms are really small and older. Club rooms are much bigger and have new amenities. Both rooms have mini-refrigerators, TV's, blow-dryers, and coffee makers. Overall, this was a great, clean, place to stay, in a great location and moderatly priced. Beware wherever you go of the homeless. They are on practically every corner in Union Square begging for change!

<Content>Excellent place to stay My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights. The room, almost a suite, was excellent value considering the very central location of this hotel. The attached restaurant served a good choice of meals at affordable prices. The sevice was first class. Very useful info provided by John Wood, the concierge. Will certainly stay here again when if SF.

<Content>Can't get better Can't get better for location, hotel and cost. Very clean rooms, stayed in a club room overlooking the pool area, very quiet and comfortable. The pool is excellent and is a sun trap, about 10 degrees warmer than outside the hotel and the heated pool is great. Daily Grill accessible through the hotel is a very good place to eat and drink.

<Content>Wonderful Stay I have been reading the hotel reviews for about 6 months now and felt that I needed to contribute my experiences as it may help others as it has helped me.We stayed at the Handlery June 8-June 14. Trying to get to know San Francisco as my daughter will be going to college there. We live in Massachusetts so I can't tell you how much research I did before we got there and as you can imagine, very nervous as this is the place my daughter will live for the next 4 years  3000 miles away! My goal was to find a small hotel with excellent service where I can come when I visit her for the next four years! I had 3 other hotels on my list and after speaking to Christine, the general manager on the phone before I made my reservation, I knew this was the place for us. As we did not spend much time in our room getting to know the city, EVERYONE there made us feel right at home. I even got to meet Mr. Handlery himself and he made us feel very welcome. Dale at the conceirge desk was so gracious to us and answered every question I had no matter how stupid it may have been. Our room was very clean and was very quiet. We faced the pool area. I think there was some kind of convention in town and on one night, there was some loudness by the pool at 11 pm. But it only went on for a few minutes before someone from the hotel put a stop to it. We were impressed. We will be returning in August for the emotional dorm move-in with my daughter and The Handlery is were we will be returning and returning again.

<Content>Excellent Deal We stayed there for our Honeymoon in the Club Area - Got a package deal (on their website) which included free parking. In my opinion this was the best way to go because parking is not cheap in San Fran! We loved our room. Comfortable big bed, clean, lovely decor! This was a four star hotel for the price of a two star! I think a gem. The social butterfly conceirege was very friendly. This hotel is very central and makes it easy to get to many neat places by foot. Our room was facing the pool courtyard and was very quiet. The only thing they forgot was to give us our honeymoon package (wine, chocolate, etc...) but was rectified by the professional desk staff.

<Content>Our fabourite city hotel on our honeymoon Having spent the honeymoon in several 5 star hotels, we personally preferred this one out of all of them, even though it was only mentioned as a 3 star plus.The room was the biggest we had been given. (In the 5 stars we had the executive suites). There were 2 large closets for clothes and a respectable bathroom. Because it was an old building it had real character with sash windows and white fire escapes running down the building exterior.The bed was firm yet soft and comfortable. There was a lot of noise from the street not helped by the single-glazed sash windows, but I only ever woke once briefly to the sound of a fire engine.The staff were helpful and genuine. In the Daily Grill the meals were big enough for 2 people.We only stayed 2 nights here but it wasn't enough to see San Fransisco so we will have to return and the Handlery will be where we will stay.

<Content>Hits all the right buttons Arrived to find we had been upgraded to the Club section, a very pleasent surprise. The room was large and airy, with a very good bathroom/dressing section, extremely comfortable king bed, and comprehensively appointed. There was a small sitting area with sofa and chairs next to a balcony - and this was the only downside. Other reviews of the Handlery have mentioned street noise - and our room overlooked O'Farrell Street. Take heed - it is noisy, but sleep is easy with earplugs, and this small problem should not put anyone off this excellent hotel. You can bet all the other hotels which are as convenient as this suffer the same problem! We were only there for three days, but found the Daily Grill filled all our needs, and those of a lot of locals, always a good sign. Friendly and courteous staff made for a great break - would return here any time.

<Content>Excellent service We stayed here for 4 nights in March 2005 and knew absolutely nothing about the hotel,having booked it through an agent. We did ask in advance for a quiet room as we had heard that Union Square could be noisy. On booking in we were told that the Chairman of the hotel wished to meet us who had been informed it was my husband's birthday trip and had even arranged for a bottle of champagne for our room. The staff were wonderful and while we did eat in Lefty's one morning, the service and atmosphere was so good in the Daily Grill, we stuck with it. The food was very good both for breakfast and dinner but for us Brits,one meal shared was sufficient. The Concierge helped us in any way she could and gave us some good tips on where to go.Altogether an excellent hotel we would recommend to anyone and would certainly stay in again (preferably when it stops raining and we can use the pool!!)

<Content>Great except the noise Just stayed here for 4 nights for a convention. Stayed in the newer club rooms, which were very nice. Had plenty of room, good beds, etc. Only problem was very loud street noise, it was the loudest hotel I have ever stayed in! I had not known to ask for a room facing the pool. We asked housekeeping about a fan or something to drown out the noise, but they had nothing. Other than that, staff was friendly and helpful, especially about public transportation. It is a short easy walk from the BART station, as well as cable car and bus stops, the convention center. The restaurant they recommended in Chinatown, Great Eastern, was below average though. After the first night, we bought earplugs, which helped alot, though you could still hear some street noise. If you ask for a quiet room, this hotel should be great.

<Content>Fun, Quick, Trip My husband and I along with another couple friend of ours made a one night quick get away to San Francisco and chose The Handlery for the price and location. I had stayed here before and once again, they met my expectations. The staff here is really nice and helpful, it's in an excellent area and the rooms are nice and cozy. After a long night of partying, we slept wonderfully in our very comfortable beds! Can't wait to go back!

<Content>Great Family Stay Last week we stayed with my family of 4 in one of the rooms in the new section of the hotel. We'd done enough research and had stayed once before that we knew we wanted an inside room so we didn't have to deal with street traffic. We got a good rate online and were even able to book a room just one day in advance via the internet that the hotel staff when we called them directly weren't able to book. Odd but...we were very happy. We had a room with two queen beds and LOTS of space in the bathroom area. This was a CLUB QUEEN QUEEN room. Their regular room that we had last year with just two full sized beds was nicely furnished but much smaller.This isn't the nicest hotel in town but it was perfect for us with our two kids -- 7  9 -- to walk VERY easily to Union Square and take the cable car across town. It's such a central location we'll definitely keep staying here. It's one of the only hotels in the area with a pool in this price range which is also a big plus for us with kids who love to swim.

<Content>Loved this hotel We stayed here for 2 nights. I would definitely recommend the Club Rooms. I didn't find it noisy, but then we were facing the pool. Actually the people in the pool were really noisy, but then we were in bed by 8pm with jetlag! But other than that, the noise levels were fine. Friendly, helpful staff. I'd recommend Lefty's (just turn right out of the hotel, and it's next door) for breakfast - half the price of the Daily Grill - although the Daily Grill was rather good. Excellent spot for shopping and the cable cars. Definitely recommend this place.

<Content>hidden gem Right off the bat, I'd like to say that I am a very fussy traveller. After numerous diappointing trips in travel agent recommended hotels, I booked the Handlery on the basis of the majority of comments posted by other travellers to your site. The reviews were bang on. The location of the hotel is second to none, directly at Union Square, in the midst of some fabulous shopping. The staff was very nice and accomdating, the concierge even going so far to purchase a little easter bunny for my 7 year old daughter, who accompanied us. The pool area was a welcome relaxtion point after a long day of touring. We purchased the bed and Breakfast plan directly off the Hanlery's site, and were treated to a gargantuan breakfast daily. Our room was large, and very well appointed, having nice fluffy robes. The ONLY downside to the hotel was the noise levele from OUTSIDE the property. After a restless first night, my husband and I wore ear plaugs, and were treated to successive peaceful nights sleep. Take it from this fusspot, this is a good hotel at a remarkable price.

<Content>Noise control needed The Handlery is a good hotel as long as you wear earplugs! It is in desparate need of double gazing especially if you have a lower room facing Greary Street.The rooms are nicely fitted out, the staff good and the location the best but far too noisy.

<Content>Very central to all you need The handlery offered us a great rate for our stay of 4 nights - it was a clean - basic well serviced hotel - reception/valet staff could probably do with a little customer service training!! but at the deals they offer you cant complain. Very centrally located beside most main shopping areas and a taxi ride from the pier 39

<Content>Honeymoon bliss I chose this hotel based on information I found on this site, so I thought I would return the favor by positively reviewing the establishment.  Once we chose San Fran as our destination, planning the honeymoon was easy. But the hotel part was a bit of a challenge. I finally chose the Handlery based on: price, reviews from this site, and the cordial phone exchange I had when I called inquiring about rates. The other hotels (no names mentioned, but they were all in Union Square and were considerably more expensive) were curt and not particularly accommodating on the phone. But the woman I spoke with at the Handlery was straight-shooting, gave me her direct line if I had any questions, and offered a remarkable rate + a room upgrade since were honeymooners.  For first-time visitors like my wife and I, the ride from the airport to the hotel was a bit of an eye opener. You go through some rather decrepit areas. But the block where the hotel is (on Geary) is beautiful. Once we found our room (complete with champagne--compliments of the hotel), we were delighted. It wasn't huge, but it was more than enough, plus it had a little balcony and a small changing room adjacent to the bathroom. The bed was large and comfy and the place was SPOTLESS. I was quite relieved, having only seen a handful of lo-res pictures on some website.   The concierge was superb, and advised us (after seeing us hailing cabs the first few days) to use San Fran's excellent public transportation. Coming from Philadelphia, we were skeptical (SEPTA, for those who live in or near Philadelphia, is the most expensive public transport in the country). We found the San Fran system to be excellent and very cheap. The concierge also recommended some great (and affordable) restaurants in the area. Lefty O'Doul's was fun, cafeteria-style dining and it's literally right nextdoor to the hotel. We were able to see many sites (Golden Gate bridge, SBC Park, Chinatown, Haight-Ashbury) via a short bus ride from the hotel. The location was very convenient.   Room service was prompt and the food was always delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful. By and large, our stay was near perfect.   I have to mention the two things, just to be fair, that kept me from giving it the full five stars:  1. There was what I like to call the kiddie factor. I don't like screaming kids, sorry. In fact, I'm lukewarm on kids period. But this place, being a reasonably priced hotel in a neighborhood pretty much devoid of reasonably priced hotels, caters (from what I could see) to families. Literally every night (and early in the morning when these dreadful small creatures arise), we had some kids screaming or stomping in the hallway. This is not really the hotel's fault, but it bears mentioning for those who want a truly quiet getaway.  2. Don't let San Fran natives soft-sell you on the homeless person factor. MANY San Francisco residents scolded me for even being concerned. Well, let me tell you, these people hound you constantly and you can't walk 1/2 block without being asked for change. And some of them get downright belligerent. I realize this is a terribly insensitive thing to say, but it wasn't something we wanted to see on our honeymoon. If we wanted to see (and be able to help) homeless people, we would have gone on some kind of Christian retreat. It really put a damper on what was otherwise a stellar visit.  As long as you realize going in that it is URBAN, it is the city, you'll be okay. I think the shock of it made it hard for my wife and I. This is not a criticism of the hotel, just a warning to those unfamiliar with the area. Otherwise, this was a great visit and I would definitely recommend the Handlery--especially to honeymooners.

<Content>Great getaway for an overnight My wife and I just BARTed in from the East Bay for a night away from the kids. This hotel was very close to the Powell St. station, just a couple of block towards Union Sq. We found the location to be excellent, the service (although not used much) was very nice and welcoming.We opted for the Bed and Breakfast package, which included a full breakfast at the Daily Grill located in the hotel. This sounds like sort of a diner type restaurant, but actually it was very nice. We chose to even come back there for dinner and weren't disappointed. We stayed in the clubs section in a king room with balcony. The view was of the city, and from tripadvisor we knew there would be some street noise, but only that of any big american city.The bathrooms are nicely appointed, the linens and decor are top notch.We loved it, and plan on going back for more shopping and fun in the near future.

<Content>Fantastic location, great rooms We stayed at the Handlery Union Square for 3 nights in early January 2005. Thanks to previous Trip Advisor reviews we knew exactly where to have breakfast - at Lefty O'Doul's which is 2 doors away (on your right as you walk out). Huge serving of delicious pancakes for around $4. They also do take out which we took back to our room for our kids who wouldn't get out of bed. We stayed in a family suite which comprised a large room with two double beds and a fold out sofa bed, one bathroom  another small room with a double bed. Fortunately there were 2 TVs, a must when you have 3 children. The room was in the old section, but was beautifully refurbished  rather quaint. We had a high floor, so noise from the street wasn't a problem. There was absolutely NO view, just overlooking other old buildings, so we kept the venetian blinds shut. The room has tea/coffee making facilities and a fridge. Location was fantastic, cable cars around the corner which take you all the way to Fisherman's Wharf. Shopping at Union Square is also great. We were right in the heart of one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Highly recommended.

<Content>A1 Handlery - top location My Wife and I stayed here 17th to 22nd Nov 2004 during a 3 centre break down the west coast and had no problems at all. The only reason I've given the hotel 4 stars is because the wife says the view was not good enough. (Don't no what she expects from a San Franscisco hotel window?). Anyway the hotel reception is stylish the rooms spotless with nice decor. Would recommend the steak and eggs for breakfast at the grill that is joined on to the hotel. A tip would be to get a MUNI pass on your first day there, we paid $20 each for a 7 day one and it paid for itself a few times over the amount of times we used public transport - especially the cable cars. The Handlery is also very central - 50yds to union square and the shopping is A1. After a hard days sight seeing or shopping ' The Irish Bar ' at the back entrance to the hotel and the Boddingtons it served proved a perfect nightcap.

<Content>Great Place! Excellent Location!! Amazing!! My wife and I honeymooned there in July 2004. The place was awesome. First of all, they upgraded us to a complimentary suite. They also sent champaign and chocolates to our room, twice!! It is also located in a prime spot. This was our first time to San Francisco, and it was very easy to get around from the hotel. The famous cable cars are very, very close. Chinatown is also nearby (about a ten minute walk). It is a fun place with great (and cheap) food. There are also other forms of public transportation that are located nearby (five minutes walking). The concierge desk is a tremendous help. We were clueless to many things, but they were able to get us through everything. One day, we decided to rent a car. So, we called the concierge and they arranged everything for us. We just walked around the block and picked up the car. The stay was great, and I would go back in a heartbeat.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!!

<Content>Wonderful family owned property Just spent a weekend at the Handlery and was very pleased, once again.Our room was nicely decorated in shades of sage green. We had 2 full size beds, an armoire (with a tv, a small fridge and a coffee maker ), a low dresser that doubled as a bench to sit upon or place bags upon, two chairs and a couple night tables. There was a large walk-in closet (plenty of room to hang clothes and store luggage), and a bathroom with a tub/shower, sink and toilet. Wasn't a big bathroom, but it was big enough, and very, very clean. The room is on the smallish side, but it was fine for the 3 of us for a couple nights. A king room would be just fine for 2 for an extended trip.Keep in mind it is not a high end hotel (like the Ritz or the St Francis), but it is a good solid value with clean, comfortable rooms, a perfect location. It has more personality than a Holiday Inn or Ramada. The staff is wonderful and knowledgable about the city, and the location is PERFECT.

<Content>Great location Stayed here 29-30 September.Loved it. It was nice to stay in something a bit quirky and different.Asked for a quiet room (mindful of other complaints about street noise) and was given one which looked into a window shaft between buildings - and that was fine and it was quiet which was really important because lots of hotel workers were striking while we were in SF- chanting outside hotels from early till late. Handlerys staff were not stiking but staff across the road at another hotel were. So we smugly enjoyed our lack of view and the silence.Room not overly large, but well appointed.Location was great. We caught the BART in from the airport and were easily able to manage our bags up to the hotel. We also easily managed our bags to the big rental car gararge along the next street. Perfect spot.

<Content>Great hotel, good size room . Good hotel close to excellent shops and restuarants in Union Square. Large double room with good bathroom fascilities. Very clean. Easy walking distance to cable cars and trolleys stops. Staff were friendly and helpful. Apparently good resturant in hotel but did not have time to sample. Looked inviting though. Wolud certainly choose again as San Francisco great fun and Pier 39 and 41 fantastic fun and wodeful seafood.

<Content>Good time in San Fran My wife and I stayed here for four nights in September and found it to be well located. Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful although a couple of the staff at the check in desk came over as a little arrogant, standing at the desk and being ignored is not nice. The room as with the hotel was clean and comfortable. San Francisco is a great city and would visit again. Over all I would recommend the Handlery

<Content>Fantastic location! The Handlery is in the most perfect position to explore Union Square and beyond. It's right near the cable cars to take you to Fisherman's Wharf, we didn't need our car at all. $29 per night for parking is a bit steep though!!Also a perfect place to visit the many shops and restaurants around the city. The Concierge was very helpful giving us some great places to eat...Yum!! Lefty O'Douls (2 doors down) was a great spot for a cheap and fast breakfast.The Handlery was clean and spacious and our room was very quiet. Pool was heated and great for a relax after a day to Alcatraz!

<Content>Great location We stayed here in August for 1 night for the last leg of our honeymoon. We were upgraded on arrival to a club room by the pool, and received a bottle of champers and a basket of fruit, nibbles etc. The room was clean, airy, quite spacious, and being at the inner part of the hotel, we didn't hear traffic noise. We were recommended to go a door down to Lefty O'Douls for breakfast and so glad we did. They do fantastic omelettes and pancakes and it has a real feel about the place. We also went to a groovy little diner just off Union Square which was done out similar to a Greece set!! Very quirky!!The pool seemed a bit in need of work, but apart form that everything else was fine. A fabulous base to see San Francisco, right smack bang on the doorstep of Union Square, and a tram stop within footsteps.

<Content>Fabulous!! We stayed at The Handlery for 2 nights in August. The entire city had no hotel rooms - we were lucky to get a suite of any kind 3 days prior to arrival. Even so, we booked the Jr. Executive Suite for a special rate of $170/night. We expected an ok hotel, particularly because it was family run, but never did we expect it to be FABULOUS! The room was gorgeous - one of the best we've ever stayed in - the staff so much more than courteous (including the valets who helped us unload 2 weeks worth of baggage with our 2 kids!), and the location was perfect as it overlooks Union Sq. The only drawbacks are that it's a bit loud (the windows are original and you hear most of what's going on outside - not an issue if you're a city dweller) and the building layout is a bit confusing as it's in 2 buildings. The concierge booked us at a perfect French restaurant - exactly what we asked for - and the comments I left on their card solicited a personal reply from the owner. Is this customer service or what??!?Stay with no qualms! And ask about some of their special rooms - we were shocked at how inexpensive their suite was. Same room at our local Cincinnatian (a comparable great hotel) would have been $450. Can't say enough good about it!

<Content>Great hotel - shame about the noise! Visited here in August as part of our honeymoon package. The location of this hotel is perfect, right in the heart of union square, a shoppers paradise!We were unfortunately allocated a 2 single bed room on our first night (and there were no other rooms available), the hotel rectified this the following day, with a fantastic room overlooking Union square. The one problem we found with rooms at the front is the noise. Trust me, the dustcarts at 4/5 am are the noisiest dustcarts I have ever heard in my entire life - take earplugs!I believe the rooms in the club section overlooking the pool are the best rooms to stop in.Great city though, loads of character and some wonderful skyscraper views in the Carnelian Restaurant - go at sunset - it is just beautiful as the sun sets over the Golden Gate Bridge.Do a city tour and book Alcatraz in advance (otherwise you will be disappointed). We also ventured to Muir Woods and Sausalito, both beautiful places.One final piece of advice - take a jumper or light coat for the evening, it does get chilly.

<Content>Good bargain/Get Club Room Hey, I'm that friend from across the hall (see other review) and I really liked the Bill Murray guy in the Lefty O'Doul piano bar. Club rooms are a must if you have a family. We had 3 small kids and could fit a nice roll-a-way in the room. Definitely a good bargain... THe pool isn't big but not bad for San Fran, where it is hard to find pools, particulary in Union Square. Two Starbucks within walking distance. It was hard to get the room made up at a decent hour. Staff was great: in particular. Herme and Kevin rock!

<Content>Good Location We stayed 4 nights at this hotel and found it excellent - lovely and clean, comfortable beds. The location was fantastic for us - just off Union Square and handy for shopping, the cable car etc.. The only downside was the room was cramped for the 4 or us (2 adults and 2 teenagers), but we did have one of the cheaper rooms - so not complaining.I had wondered whether to stay near Fishermans Wharf but glad we didn't as we found it a bit tacky.We didn't eat in the attached restaurant - but found some excellent diners just around the corner - good for breakfast. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Content>HONEYMOONERS BEWARE! We chose this hotel out of many others because the brochure said they offered a good honeymoon package and we'd read before on this site that people had been upgraded. Unfortunately, the room we got was terrible. It over looked a brick wall and the hotels main air ventilation pipe which hummed all day and night non stop.The honeymoon package consisted of a cheap bottle of wine, 2 apples, 2 oranges and a bag of pretzels.We didn't feel special one bit in this place. The staff were unattentive. Anyone can easily walk in off the street and take themselves around the hotel and non of the staff would realise, as we proved when we met up with friends and took them up to our room unchallenged.And one last thing, whatever you do, don't use the phone in your room. 20 minutes to the UK cost $170 (拢95). Shame on you Handerlery.

<Content>Choose wisely! What a find!! Spend a few dollars extra for the club room and ask for a pool view to insure relative quiet. Friends across the hall had a better city view but more noise. Our family of four (2+2) had plenty of room, the pool was well heated, and Lefty O'Douls Pub next door has a hilarious piano bar singer (think Bill Murray on SNL) and the best breakfast deal outside of Jack in the Box. The refrigerator worked great, the $10 parking special was a steal (with helpful attendants), the air conditioning seemed adequate, and the location was incredible. We will surely return on our next SF visit. The only problem was getting the room made up before 5:00.

<Content>Good Location, but spartan accomodations My two brothers and I were in town to see the Cubs. We got the $249 3 bed suite, which consisted of two small rooms with an adjoining bathroom (also small). The hallways were musty, the beds were short and narrow, and one of the TVs (the one facing the 2 beds and couch) was busted. The two window views were of perching and defecating pigeons, and the other to an alley.The bar next door had harmelssly smartalecky bartenders, which was fun. Limited interaction with front desk, but no problems either at checkin or checkout.It is a healthy walk to SBC Park, but right near Union Square.

<Content>Very impressed w/location, employees,  Just returned from 5-night stay. Huge King Club room overlooked noisy O'Farrell St., but earlier reviews prompted us to bring ear plugs - after 1st night, didn't notice the noise. GREAT location  helpful, accomodating employees. Nicely updated room had scales (ugh!), robes, regular fridge  makeup mirror, too. 23 steps to main building. Liked the fact that we could take elevator to garage  go straight out to O'Farrell. Breakfast package for Daily Grill was a good deal. Lots of shops  eateries all around. Would stay there again (maybe even try pool side next time).

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in mid June 2004. Friends were also staying at the hotel, so we got to see 4 different rooms. All of which were fantastic. We were in a quad share room which had a lot of space. Nice clean bathrooms and hotel. Pool was nice to swim in after a hard day of sight seeing. Would stay here again.

<Content>Good Location, Nice Room BUT We stayed here New Year's Eve. We requested a room with a view of Union Square which we were told we'd have yet we did not get when we checked in. The rooms were nice and we did get a nice view of the other side. The staff however did not make a good impression, almost semmed as if they did not want to be there.

<Content>Great hotel. I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in May after reading good reports about it on this web site ,this hotel is great value with a great location the hotel is very clean with friendly helpful staff .The location is great with shops galore and the tram stop almost outside the hotel entrance .Only one bad point was the amount of beggars outside in the street asking for money but they were friendly enough, and did not stop us having a marvelous holiday in this great USA city.

<Content>great location but be aware of room sizes We stayed 2 nights in april 2004. In the historic wing. The place was nice and clean, staff was friendly.Location was great...close to all the huge department stores all within walking distance. But remember not to stay in the rooms by the street as they are small in size and noisy...you can hear all the traffic and talking/screams at night by passer byes..it makes it difficult to sleep...the rooms further in are more spacious..we experienced both rooms as the toilet plumbing went bung!..and we were moved to the inner rooms away from the street noise...I can say that i would stay there again but room size and positioning are important..but location was fantastic.

<Content>Quaint and Enjoyable, but.... The Handlery Union Square, San Francisco, CA is a quaint hotel in the heart of Union Square. The location is ideal seeing the sights of San Francisco via walking, public transportation, and personal auto. The hotel staff is quite helpful (e.g., the concierge service was very knowledgeable and friendly) with the only exception being one member of the front desk staff who seemed to being having a perpetual bad day each time I or a member of my family interacted with her. Not-a-problem, however, we simply infuriated her with kindness and sought out the concierge representatives.The room was nicely appointed with comfortable beds. The only complaint offered would be the miserable view of a back alley and roof top air-conditioning units. Speaking of air-conditioning, it is my assumption that the roof-top air-conditioning units were only for show as the temperature in the room seemed to never drop below 75 degrees and was not remedied even after contacting maintenance. This, however, was resolved by opening the windows at night with surprisingly little noise creeping in from the outside.While all rooms in San Francisco come at a rather hefty price, overall the Handlery offers nice mid-week packages for the holiday family traveler. Bring a fan and enjoy the accommodations of the Handlery. It's always more enjoyable to suffer a bit of heat in a quaint luxury hotel as compared to the factory hotel boxes occupying most cities.

<Content>Good.....but We booked the Handlery Union Square for our first 3 nights (19-21 April 2004) of our honeymoon which began in San Francisco. We booked a room in the Club Section and the room was gorgeous. The hotel is in a fab location right round the corner from Union Square and all the great stores/restaurants etc. Fab location!Heres the but.......the room overlooked an Irish Pub....and at 2am every morning we were woken by the pub emptying. The first morning I couldn't even figure out where I was or what all the noise was about because it sounded like it was right outside our door. By the 2nd morning we were not impressed. We only had one more night and the hotel was fully booked so we lasted the full 3 nights. This hotel has a great location with lovely rooms but it seriously needs to invest in double-glazing!!!!!The check-in staff wore scowls constantly and when my husband rang down to ask a question was given 'No' as the reply and the phone went dead. The concierge was the most unhelpful man I've ever met and the restaurant staff were so slow and unfriendly I felt I should have been paid to eat there.We met a couple who stayed at the Westin St Francis and couldn't praise it enough so I think we'll be going there next time. It was in our short-list initially but a friend recommended the Handlery and we said we'd give it a try. Not the most restful 3 nights I've ever had though!

<Content>Handlery great but!!! Myself and 4 Girlfriends stayed in The Handlery Hotel for 4 nights, we had booked a twin and triple room on arrival we were upgraded to the club section with interconnecting doors Fantastic location a lovely hotel, I would recommend to anyone except for one thing the staff are not very friendly in particular the bar staff. We found them very rude no way helpful and if they could avoid serving us they would. I would still stay there again as the location and hotel were first class. Probably avoid having a drink!!!

<Content>Location, location, location This hotel has an excellent location, tucked between many of the finest hotels of the city, and is close to Union Square. Many of the hotels we tried to book were full, but we were able to get a good rate here, which included breakfast. Were I to stay there again, I would go for the rate which includes parking ($27 a day, going rate in the city). The decor is very handsome and the bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, period. The pool is not of resort caliber, but it is well tended, heated and my two boys were happy to splash about after a day in the city. HOWEVER, there is a huge difference in the rooms overlooking the alley as opposed to those by the pool. The noise from the alley kept me awake all night. They were able to offer me a different room for the second night of our stay and it made all the difference in the world. The rooms on the pool side are larger and very quiet at night.

<Content>Wonderful honeymoon! We stayed for 7 nights at the Handlery and were upgraded to a huge suite which was a wonderful surprise. We received a hamper of fruit and sparkling wine as it was our honeymoon. Service was excellent - whenever we had a query it was answered immediately. The pool was an asset as not many hotels in the city have one. The restaurant adjoining was excellent too. Would definitely go back!

<Content>A family run hotel and it shows. My wife and I stayed five nights at the Handlery. Reception was friendly and efficient and despite having a junior suite, my wife was unhappy with the view. No problem, they changed our room and we stayed in the club section. All the staff were very helpful especially the concierge service and we would reccomend this family owned and run hotel over the inpersonable chains.

<Content>Fantastic position - fabulous stay My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights after I had stayed briefly on business several years ago. The room was out of this world - a one-bedroomed suite even though we had paid the basic rate. the position is unrivalled, as most guided tours depart from Union Square, just one block away. Also just one block away is the cablecar terminus and Macy's department store. Staff were very friendly and helpful. I left my jacket in the taxi from the airport and the concierge told me not to worry, he would make sure I got it back. He did too! Great to have a swimming pool in a city-centre hotel, and a brilliant restaurant serving breakfast and dinner. I would never stay anywhere else in San Francisco!!

<Content>Rooftop seclusion. The late Grandma Handlery's rooftop apartment is a great escape from the city and includes a private patio. No view, but definitely Handlery's best-kept secret. A great old-San Francisco hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful, including those in the adjoining restaurant, The Daily Grill (which has great food). I've stayed here three times, and each time has been special thanks to the Handlery staff! The updated lobby decor adds to the metropolitan feel without distracting from the Old San Francisco feel.

<Content>Not bad... Good points: MASSIVE room, truly was huuuuuge, but I think it was a corner room, so it was larger than normal, but we didn't pay any extra for it. Good location for the shops. The staff were friendly, especially Dale (don't know if he's still working there.)Bad points: The tramps outside dampened the atmosphere, and we felt we couldn't go out at night. Insultingly small swimming pool. The restaurant was shut when we were there (was in 2001, sure it's all renovated now!) so had to eat at Lefty O'Tooles (like a canteen) and a HIDEOUS diner, was like the diner on 'No Batteries Included'. Is also quite a way from the Wharf and Alcatraz, especially with all them hills.Would not go back to San Fran, not many things to do there!

<Content>good location We stayed at the Handlery in August 2003, on our honeymoon. When we arrived, our room had been upgraded and we got champagne and fruit. The room was very clean and comfortable. The location is excellent for Union Sqaure and shopping. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We would definitly stay there again if ever in San Francisco.

<Content>Best bed on our trip We stayed in the Club Section with a view of the pool.This was one of the best rooms we stayed in our our trip to America. The room was very nice, recently redone. The bed was the best part of it. It was soooo comfortable my husband and I did not want to get out of it.We found the staff at the reception desk very friendly and helpful. We were even upgraded to the Club Section.This place is close to everything, especially the shops. There is a great restuarant across the road. I can not remember the name of it but if you walk out the front of the hotel and look to the across the road to the left it is on the corner.Only con was the homeless people on the street, they scared me a few times but most of the time my husband was with me. I don't think it would matter where you stay in SF, you would still encounter this.We had a great time but remember to bring your winter cloths. We were there mid July and it was COLD.

<Content>Won't be going back.. Not one of my favourite US hotels. On the plus side the location couldn't be more ideal for the shopping, chinatown and public transport; the furnishings are great and it is one of the few hotels in SF that has a heated (small) pool - although the pool area doesn't get much in the way of sunshine because of the surrounding buildings. And the staff were very polite and helpful - aside from one lady on reception who thought it hilarious that our room key cards had been cancelled at 0200 one morning.The negatives predominated however - starting with my online reservation of a king balcony room - I didn't get a king bed and I didn't get a balcony room either.Their own website states each room equipped with wireless internet access - they aren't, so lugging a laptop six thousand miles did annoy me slightly as it was one of the deciding factors of my choice, almost as much as the next to useless webTV that is there. If this was a UK hotel I would be reporting them for fraud.As has been stated in other reviews, if you're not in the club section the rooms are tiny even by SF standards (my party had rooms in both sections). The twin non-club rooms we saw were too small to even store two people's luggage - bear that in mind if your planning a stay of any length.rThe air con in the club room was woefully inadequate - nothing but low speed - and what really irked me was that California was in the grip of a heatwave for the first few days of the visit and the hotel dealt with it by 'rationing' everyone's air conditioning by setting the minimum available temperature to 68 degrees from a central control - absolutely unbelievable!!Housekeeping in the club room was sporadic with beds and coffee forgotten on some days, but fine in the other room - aside from a few years worth of grime on the windows that somewhat clouds the view!All in all it was a place to sleep for a couple of weeks, but not one I will be returning to..

<Content>Not A Good End To A USA Trip! I realise that hotel rooms are generally quite small in San Francisco but this was ridiculous! The room was small, dirty, and from the window all we could see was the building next door. There was some strange smell coming from the air conditioning vent, and the staff were EXTREMELY rude and impolite. After staying at various hotels throughout the US this was definately the worst! We will never ever stay here again! You would at least think the staff would be courteous... if you want nice people- go somewhere else!
