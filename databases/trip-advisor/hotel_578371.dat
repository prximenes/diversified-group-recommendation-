<Content>Edwin was great! We love him Edwin DeJesus Lopez made our trip. He was so much fun to hang out with and made sure that our entire family had an amazing stay at the hotel. This man deserves only the best and we are sincerely going to miss him. Best employee in the hotel by far!

<Content>Punta Canwe have service? To start off, our family of 6 took this vacation as a business benefit which we receive, once a year, a five star resort vacation. This one, by far, has been the biggest letdown. When we arrived we were excited but once we walked into our rooms we were a little bit unsure of the quality of the hotel. Despite that the hotel is only 3 years old it appears to be more like 30 (no exaggeration). Of the three rooms that we each had two had problems. The first room did not have the bathrobes or slippers which were promised, and the toilet seat would not stay up (very difficult for the men). The plugs were barely functional in the sinks and bathtubs, there were stains, the ceiling and tiles were cracked and covered in grit. The second room needed improvement. For starters, having a working light in the shower, a working telephone, and not to mention the missing alarm clock (not that the ones in the other rooms worked), would have been nice. Moving on to the service. The tidiness of the room seemed to dwindle after the first day. First everything was done excellent. But then they stopped bringing clean towels and restocking the minifridge. Then it was the cans and garbage being left behind. Finally the bed was skipped over completely. Fortunently we had one towel for the two of us to dry off with.The food quality was good, but not five star quality. Ordering a drink could sometimes be a task and even when you placed your order you weren't really sure what you were getting. We had several great waiters that we tried to find every night, but the remainder left us unsatisfied and disappointed. We were excited about in room internet (even though we had to pay) but after waiting for two hours after paying for it and no one showed up to fix the problems that we called about several times we gave up. From our experience figure out a way around problems, don't bother asking for help (they don't seem interested in your needs).The Casino was fun, and of course we had two guests who love to gamble, but I am not sure if 25 slots and 4 tables is a casino (especially when the change the table rules to even more favor the house). All in all, we absolutely loved the pool (one of the best) and the ocean. You can't beat the beautiful white sand, and warm expansive beach line. Our only suggestion is if you're looking for a five star service and quality get that at different resort; Majestic Colonial is more like 4 star quality with 3 star service.

<Content>Majestic Colonial My wife and I enjoyed our honeymoon at the majestic this past summer (7/8/08 - 7/15/08). We were treated like royalty and the staff did an amazing job at making everyday special. When our room was close to the construction they upgraded us to one of the nicest suites at the resort. We loved the private jacuzzi on our outdoor balcony. We enjoyed all the shows and had a great time. The food was awesome and we took a picture of every meal we ate to show our family and friends. We can wait to go back.

<Content>Fabulous!! My family has been to the DR several times and we have stayed on Bavaro beach which is spectacular! We have stayed at the Iberostar and Principe resorts, but this time, decided to try the Majestic for two weeks over Xmas. What a great hotel! Attentive staff right from the general manager, Carlos Fresca (who was everywhere making sure things were perfect) to the dining room (thanks to Marisol Bulin, Yandra, Christian and Roberto) to the beach concierge, Denny. Waiters and bartenders were polite and always had a smile; dining areas were clean with lots and lots of varieties of food.Loved the rooms (with large shower and inroom jacuzzi), the pool was beautiful and well maintained - the gardens amazing - the comfy chairs in the auditorium were great and what I loved the most is that there were more than enough comfortable beach loungers and pool chaises, no matter what time of the day you wanted to lounge.Food variety and prep was excellent - Xmas eve feast of seafood, imported cheeses and fruits and too many goodies to name! Santa was on site as well - kids loved that!Would definitely recommend as a superior hotel, where we will without doubt vacation again!

<Content>Great Hotel with Great Service We visited there from Dec 19, 2008 to Dec 26, 2008.It was a great experience. We were part of the Gold Club Cameleon.Checkin:When we got there we had a separate checkin, we were a family of 5, including 3 kids. As soon as we got to the checkin, they realized they had given us 2 separate rooms. They immediately changed that to 2 adjoining rooms. With a King/2 doubles. Worked out great. Rooms:Rooms were fairly clean, all supplies were there and abundant so nothing to complain about.Facilities:Great facilities, no problem with lounge chairs at the pool or at the beach. The beach was fantastic, and the pool was great, a meandering pool where you can be by the action or be by yourself in some quiet corner.Bars:There was never any line up at the bar, and the staff were all very friendly and courteous.Food:Food was great, we tried the local dominican, it was greate we all had fun. The buffet was great with the amount of variety there you really do not need ala cartes. They had a different theme every night. We also ate at the beach club since it was easy to get to during lunch. They also had a couple of outdoor snack/buffet style lunches at the beach.The Christmas eve/day buffet setup was wonderful we really enjoyed that.Service:Service was great all around, from Checkin/Checkout, room cleaning, food service/servers absolutely wonderful.Special mention for the crew in the buffet service: Marisal Larenzo, Lenny Guzman, Yandra and Sucre they were really wonderful all the way. They made sure we had everything we wanted during breakfast/dinner. Thank you.I must say this was one of the best vacations we have had for an all inclusive and we have been to many of them.

<Content>Almost great My husband and I visited Majestic Colonial in August '08 for our Honeymoon. Upon arrival we realized we were supposed to have vouchers to get our taxi and to check in. My travel agent forgot to give us these, but Carlos at the front desk quickly helped us check in.We received the room we requested. GORGEOUS view!! We stayed in the Colonial Jr. Suite Ocean front room complete with outdoor Jacuzzi. The room was large, the view AMAZING, but the lack of bathroom door is a bit awkward. After reading the reviews I decided to go on this trip with a very open mind about the food. The first night we went to the steakhouse...it was good. After that, I didn鈥檛 eat much. Lunch was the worst. I lost weight going to an all inclusive resort!! The grounds are truly amazing. The island and water are gorgeous. The service was also very good. However, I will not go back because of the food and that is a shame!

<Content>Very disappointed with the standard of cleanliness in room and housekeeping in g Spent one week at this Hotel and would not go back. It was a long way to travel, especially for one week. I took my daughter and two grandchildren and having checked reviews etc plumped for this hotel. On a positive note I have to say that the staff were very pleasant and the childrens club when it was eventually finished midway through the holiday provided a worthwhile experience for the grandchildren. The staff at the childrens club were exceptional considering the conditions that they were having to work in - building work being completed, painting of the outer building etc.The bedroom smelt of mould and a mustiness that was disgusting. It was possible that this was as a result of the jacussi/bath being placed openly within the bedroom and not as a separate attached room....who knows? The bedding was of a poor standard and I am quite certain that the bedroom floor was not washed during the whole of our stay - the childrens feet were black and that was after they had just showered. The towels were of a poor quality - when we actually were given them and despite reporting the lack of towels to guest relations we are still waiting for the housekeeping supervisor to bring them.Housekeeping may seem a trivial point of discussion but in actual fact a number of assumptions are made based on your immediate opinion of the room that has been allocated to you - if it's not what you expect , and of a poor standard then you begin to wonder what you have actally paid for. I certainly did not anticipate it being so poor especially as the hotel boasts a five star rating. I note that most of the rave reviews are from visitors from Canada and the USA and I found that extremely surprising knowing the high standards that they offer in their own country.Although I've had the opportunity to voice my opinion of the room we were allocated and the general poor standard of the Housekeeping - sack the supervisor I say! I must say that the food was plentiful and of a good standard. The choice of cuisine was varied and the weather - even though it rained everyday, was superb. Staff at the bars , restaurants and kiddies club exceptional.

<Content>Overall okay. Overall a nice place, very clean, staff friendlyTHe biggest disappointment was they didnt give us rooms near each other.We had three rooms, and our teens room was in a different building and not close by. Was an inconvenience.We booked this trip last march or april and I think our rooms should have been together. Can't understand why this cant be done if requested.Would probably go to a different resort next time.Karen C.Pennsylvania

<Content>Second Time - Great Place This was our second visit this year and were not disappointed!!!The reason for going again to this hotel was the size - not too large, great staff and wonderful beach. The rooms are large and spacious and the grounds are beautiful with the lush tropical vegetation. The food was above average to excellent, with a good variety especially the beef and the sea bass at the Gourmet Restaurant. Daniel in the lobby bar was extremely friendly - always remembered your favourite drink and mixed a mean drink. His English is extremely good as well. Also Jenny, who greeted us most mornings for breakfast remembered us from our previous visit, was always smiling and very friendly. In fact everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. We also had a chance to go to the Majestic Elegance (next door and sister hotel). It is not quite finished but is truly magnificant. It will be run to the highest standards under the management of Mr Jose-Maria (previously at Majestic Colonial). We will look forward to a visit to this hotel in the near future. tThis was our 8th trip to Punta Cana at various resorts and this truly is one of our very favourites. For fun in the sun and bang for your buck this is the place to be!!!!!!

<Content>Third time at the Majestic Colonial---Always a fantastic time! I have previously posted a review back in January of 2008 as that was the last time we were at the Majestic. We are a family of five, 2 adults and three teenage sons...I read all the reviews and can not believe some of the experiences. We have been to the Majestic Colonial three times in a year and a half and have not encountered one bad thing...any little bump along our stay was addressed and taken care of right away. Before you make any assumptions we are accustomed to travelling and staying in the likes of a Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton type of property. The Majestic Colonial is right up there for what they offer in service. Please remember we are visitors in their country. The Dominican people are hard working, always trying to please and make your vacation one to remember.I will just say we were not disappointed in the least with this last stay. I just want to give Kudos to all the staff at the resort but in particular:Denny - Beach Concierge...he is at your disposal for any thing you may need and truly cares about your stay, not just bringing you drinks on the beach!Nubella and Alicia - Housekeeping - from the moment we arrived she made sure that we had what we needed in both rooms.Anne Marie - Concierge - she made sure we had everything we needed and even arranged a tour of the Majestic Elegance....I will comment on that later.Murphy - Bartender in the main lobby bar - always smiling and making us smile every evening!Victor Pollantis, who was the GM of the Colonial which is now the GM of the Elegance knew we were returning to the Colonial and had offered to take a tour of the new property along with trying one of the restaurants...Victor has truly been professional and really went out of his way all three of our visits to ensure our business was appreciated. The Elegance is absolutely gorgeous in and out...yes the gardens need to grow in a bit but I am sure by the summer as we are planning to return to stay at the Elegance they will be fuller. Any new hotel has growing pains and I am sure that with each passing day the hotel will absolutely achieve its name ELEGANCE! Bottom line, the Majestic has gone over and beyond all three times we have been guests there....Please don't pay attention to the negative comments....you will not be disappointed should you decide to stay at the Colonial!

<Content>beautiful!! The Majestic was absolutely beautiful. The people working there were so nice, always smiling and friendly. Especially Jimmy from the mainbuffet restaurant (lunch  supper). He and his staff were awsome!! Very good with chilldren, we (6 of us) with my 1 year old grandchild, they were so good to him! The anamation crew were also great, by the pool bar, always some kind of excitement and entertainment going on. We went to my nephews wedding on the beach there, absolutely beautiful, the best ever!!Lou, Bobcaygeon, Ont.

<Content>"Fantastic Time at the Majestic" My family and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial from December 20-December 27, 2008. What an absolute experience! This resort is rated to be a 5 star hotel, well let me tell you, this resort should be rated more like a 7 star resort. The day we checked in, our rooms were ready and what an amazing view that we had. The rooms were very large, very clean and always stocked with anything that you needed. The main buffet restaurant was amazing especially how they went all out at Christmas. There are all sorts of food for everyone to try at any given time during the day and night. You will never go hungry. We did try the Steak House which I would highly recommend. The Gourmet Restaurant was just ok, but I would not recommend it. We did try the Seafood Restaurant which was also good. The only one that we did not have the opportunity in trying was the Japanese Restaurant because they were always booked. But from what I heard from other tourists, this is the place to try during your stay.The grounds are absolutely amazing. They are always well maintained and the scenery all around just keeps you amazed. The pool was fantastic and the beach...what is there to say except for what a view. The animation team really puts their hearts and soul into everything they do. The Michael Jackson show was amazing and so was the Magic Show they had the night before we left.I would totally recommend this hotel. I am already planning my trip for next year with family. If you have any questions regarding this resort, please feel free to contact me. I would be pleased to answer any of your questions.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We have just returned from a week at the Majestic Colonial. Our stay was amazing, the staff was amazing, the beach was perfect, the grounds-very clean. No complaints at all. Very fast check-in. The food at the buffet was good, especially the cheese station and the spanish white wine Castillo. Try the cocktails - Majestic and Bahama mama! The pool is 400 meters and very clean. The Entertainment- excellent, especially Tropical Nights.We had only one rainy day.Excursions- Saona Island is a must!!! For only 99$ you are in true paradise- white sands, calm and clear sea, palm trees...My only little complaint is that the staff barely speak English and the communication is sometimes difficult. Overall- great place and I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in. I can't wait to come back!

<Content>Worst Vacation Ever I just returned from spending a week at the Majestic Colonial, and it was, hands-down, the worst hotel/resort I have ever stayed in. The food was worse than any cafeteria I have ever been to, the drinks were watered down and in tiny cups, and they were blasting CC Music Factory starting at about 8AM until around 11PM. Of the 7 nights that I stayed there, they only made up my room 4 times, and when I got there on the first day, my room was filthy. The noise was the worst part. If nothing else this could have been a relaxing trip, but they were blasting music the entire time. One of the reasons that my room was never cleaned was because they start the cleaning service at 7:30AM, and even if you have the Do Not Disturb sign on the door they still knock. The acoustics were such that you could hear someone walking on the ground floor when you were on floor 4. I was unable to get a single night of full sleep. I don't think that I could, in any way, recommend staying at the Majestic Colonial to anyone. Furthermore, I can't believe that this place has the high rankings that it does. It was awful.

<Content>majestic hotel - a breif visit and review I was a member of a group of 19 attending a wedding. Overall the week was OK. Rooms were well kept. The food was often cold. The staff generally were terrific and responsive, The evening entertainment usually was good and diosplayed many local talented people. The Hotel was too isolated. I am not a beach and bake person. The diversity of people we met was terrific.We found that going to the same eating place usually resulted in being served by the same people. In our case, Maurinto, Sucre, Salavdor, Clara, and Felix. They did quickly come to know us, learned our preferences regaredless of which meal (not all were at their buffet place) usually breakfast and several lunches and dinners.Since I had to do some work, I found the reception staff very helpful and cooperative, such as Janet Vega. I mention the staff and the people who looked after us primarily because they worked so hard to help out and within their domain helped for a pleasant stay.

<Content>The best I have ever experienced I and my wife just arrived from majestic colonial Punta Cana and even though I was too tired to do this but I felt that they absolutely deserve a complement and didn鈥檛 want to leave it until tomorrow. We were there for one week and no complain. The rooms were clean, food was excellent, entertainment was great and I would say one of the best destinations I have ever been. If you are looking for great time to worth your money and maybe more, don鈥檛 think of anywhere else but Majestic colonial.

<Content>Great holidays! My husband booked the hotel for my birthday and we stayed in the colonial suit, with a great terasse and jacuzzi. It was just fantastic! The resort is quite big, but we never felt that is was crowded. The pool was just amazing (normally we are not big fans of pools, but this one was really special). The beach was fantastic with lots of free chairs to lie down and the water - well you can never be disappointed in Dominican republic. The room itself was really great and very romantic.(be ready to have a bathroom with a different design :) it is quite open, but all was fabulous. The resort has 7 restaurants and lots of bars around, so you won't get bored. If you are looking for a romantic and luxourious holidays - colonial majestic is your choice.

<Content>Good and Bad This is a very long review. I have included the good and bad, but what was bad for us others may not mind. I have included some tips of the things you can do to enjoy your stay more, and avoid the problems we encountered. We stayed at this resort for only a week in December, and originally I was sad to be only going away for one week. However by the end of the week we were glad to be going home. It is a beautiful hotel with a lot of amazing staff! Some staff such as housekeeping as has been said in other reviews iffy. We tipped $5 a day, I don't know if this is reasonable or not, but sometimes as in other reviews they would not show up, not that we cared it made no difference to us. We read in the booklet from our room as well as on trip advisor to tip right away and this will ensure good service. We learnt quickly this is not acurate, at least not for us. After having to get Denny on the beach's attention for drinks we tipped him (around $4 or $5 for 2 drinks) thinking we wouldn't have to find him and he would come to us in the same spot right in the area he was working, however he never bothered to check with us again. So we learned the obvious, tip after good service not to get it! But as I mentioned before perhaps we don't tip enough? Which is sort of weird because apparently tips are included in the all inclusive price? We booked an Ocean front Colonial juinor suite (with the jaccuzzi both in the room and on the deck, more about the jaccuzzi's later) The deck and view were spectacular and we requested the most private balcony when we booked through West Jet not really expecting to get it, but we did and loved it. RM 1348. There was supposed to be a bottle of both rum and whiskey upon arrival in the room also with a fruit basket. The fruit basket was there and so were the glasses but the bottles of rum and whiskey were never seen. For us this wasn't a huge deal as it is all inclusive and you couldn't go more then 300 feet without finding a bar, but it is nice to get what you are supposed to without having to fight for it or consently remind and ask for things. We mentioned this to our Hola trip representative and she said she would mention it to the hotel, weither she did or not either way we never heard about it again. We also noticed and mentioned to her that our room service privacy door lock was broken, basically meaning anyone could get into our room threw it from the outside, this also was never addressed/fixed. My husband ended up jamming it from the inside with a spoon. However much that really would have stopped someone I don't really know. Again possibly not the hotels fault if the rep never did mention it to them we didn't feel like fighting with people our whole week there, and I think we are fairly easy going, so just let everything slide. As for the privacy room service door, I am not sure why they have it as the one day that we got room service for breakfast (which also comes with the room category and which we did not have to remind them) they never used it anyways they woke us up and came into the room. Again not a big deal unless you are expecting them to use the privacy door and you aren't ready for someone to come into the room, which we would have been if not for the door anyways, so well just don't expect it maybe, and take PJ's. Apparently there is also a sensor in the room that tells staff when you are in the room automatically and they will never disturb you, this did not work for us. They constantly knocked when we were in our room and we did not have the old fashioned yet highly effective DO NOT DISTURB sign. However we did see these signs elsewhere through out the hotel so if this is something important to you, you may want to ask for one on checkin. You are also supposed to get slippers and house coats for use during your stay. The house coats were there however they were very small, and there weren't slippers. So if these things are important to you and you aren't a size 0-4 you may want to bring your own. This wouldn't have mattered to us other then the staff knocking and we were scrambling for clothes, oh yes and they only knock twice and come in so don't just grab a robe and head for the door, yell 'just a minute' or something like that. As for the jaccuzzi's we never used the one on the deck as it took to long to fill and the smaller one in the room took a long time as well and the water dissappeared quickly once it was full, so we only used it once. In this category of room there is supposed to be beach towels in the room, ours also were missing, no big deal we walked down to the towel hut and tried to get towels and they wouldn't give them to us without a card. Not a problem and understandable, we went to the front desk and after explaining that the towels were never in our room did manage to get the cards and then return to the towel hut and trade the card for towels, so if you are in this category of room might be useful to make sure either the yellow beach towels (room towels are white) are in your room before the bellman leaves or that you have towel cards. Not sure if we just have bad luck or what? The food, well my husband was sick from the day after we arrived until days after arriving home and I was lucky enough to not get sick until about our third day but was also still sick for sometime after returning home. We did not drink any of the water as reccommended and we used bottled water for brushing our teeth, so not sure what that was about. The food isn't horrible but it isn't great either. Definetly take some Immodium if you don't need it great, but if you do at least you have it. We were glad we did! We also were pretty glad we took a roll of toilet paper from home to. The paper there isn't bad or anything but it is nice to have some really good stuff if you end up having to frequent the bathroom. At least we didn't gain weight this year, unlike previous trips elsewhere, which is good.The Beach was outstanding, the water is rough but it was windy the whole time we were there but we didn't mind we kind of enjoyed the waves and spent pretty much all day every day on the beach. And the water wasn't so rough, that the childern playing in it had any problems. There is fish you can feed right off the beach in not more then thigh high deep water. And we never wore shoes in the water, there are some rocks to look out for but we didn't have a problem. The sand was amazing and we walked for miles barefoot. Another great point about the beach you could walk and walk along the ocean. There are a lot of photographers along the beach that will take pictures for you and they do an absoultely amazing job! Take advantage of it, the prices aren't horrible, and you don't have to buy if you don't want to or end up not liking them. I would recommend taking some kind of inflatable lounger if you like to float in the pool and the beach chairs aren't super comfortable. I did get maybe six mosquito bites but my husband didn't even get one and we did not use any repalinat, so I don't think they are that bad. Of course we are from saskatchewan.As for the children, we were aware that this is a family resort when we went, and we don't particularly like kids, at all. However I thought the resort was large enough we would easily be able to avoid them. Especailly since there are childern areas. Not so, if you really are looking to get away from kids, or are like us and just aren't really kid people, I would highly recommend thinking about adults only resorts, and not this resort. There were crying screaming kids everywhere or we have some really bad luck, and apparently the parents are oblivious to this screaming and acting out I don't know. We went during the school season so this made no difference either. Like I said it is a family resort and we were aware of this so....our bad, but important lesson learned.Spa ~ we each had half hour massages on the beach and really enjoyed them, so next day we went to book hour long massages at the spa. My husband was in a lot of pain from the beds or pillows so he wanted to try the deep tissue massage I not being that brave and just wanting an enjoyable experience wanted the relaxation massage. They seemed to understand when we booked, but well somehow we both ended up getting the deep tissue and I was left bruised and in pain. However I should have probably attempted to stop her and sort out the problem right away rather then suffer the hour long torture. But wasn't sure with the language barrier if it would work anyway so just endured. Nothing against the spa as far as the bruises and pain go as I am told this is typical with a deep tissue, and I take medication to thin my blood so am more prone to bruising. So you may just want to confirm with your therapist that you are getting what you really want before they begin, to avoid the same mistake I made, and obviously I don't recommend the deep tissue to anyone on anticoagulation therapy!We really liked the waiters and waitresses at all of the resturants and most of the bartenders they were friendly and always happy. If you know spanish you will have an easier time at this resort, however it isn't a big deal if you don't, they are pretty good with english. Some good drinks to try are the Miami Vice and of course the Majestic. You have to ask to have alcohol in your drink which I thought was a good thing, since it is a family resort with all the kids and preggo's. The resort is about 1/4 mile long so there is a lot of walking but we enjoy this. We noted a few people in medichairs so it is a very accessible resort if you have a disability. There are elevators at the stairways everywhere we noticed and there were ramps into the lobby to the resturants and on the beach bar area. The trip all in all wasn't our best, and I am not really sure we would return to this hotel, mostly for the fact of the kids. It was clean and friendly with a beautiful pool and beach and nice rooms. There is tones of huts and chairs both on the beach and pool side. We like to sleep in and go for a late breakfast so we were never on the beach before 11 AM and never had a problem. We also never had to wait for a spot at any of the resturants either.The one major problem I was really not happy about was that we charged all of our massages to our room. The day we went to check out and pay they said the visa machine was not connecting and we would have to take money out of the ATM in the lobby. While I didn't really like this idea, what are you going to do. The machine in the lobby ended up riping us off 1,000 peso's, and the hotel did nothing about it. We were told to contact our bank when we got home. I thought ya right get out of the country and then try and fix it, yah right! This was the most upsetting part of the trip and I was very very glad we only lost 1,000 peso's and that this was only about 30 some canadian dollars. So in the future we will make sure to go down a day before we check out of resorts and pay our tab and if the machine isn't working they have at least a day to have it fixed before check out or we will try and pay in cash, which is probably the safest thing to do anyways.All in all wasn't the best trip but could have been worse.

<Content>Great room, OK stay The hotel accommodations are fabulous: we stayed in a colonial suite, it's expensive, but worth it.The pool is simply super.The beach is OK: great water, but lots of cigarette butts in the sand and sharp stones hidden in the sand under water. On the first day on the beach I punched my foot.The food is decent in the main restaurant; so-so in the restaurant on the beach.All attractions start at 10pm, sucks if you have small kids (6 y. o) -- she missed the circus and illusions (and everything else that she cared a lot less about).Kids club is a joke.Kids mini-disco is a joke as well (as bad)Basically, I have enjoyed my 2 weeks stay there, but I doubt I'll go there again.Hope this helps.

<Content>Another great trip! This was my second trip to the resort this year. The first was for a wedding and this time was just my wife and I. We both loved the resort and would certianly go again. We had a small problem with our room that we mentioned, just to make them aware and they upgraded us to a better room instantly! Let me list a few positives and negitives for everyone to see. Keep in mind, my complaints are slightly critical but how else would they make any changes?Personally, Id rate it a 4.5 out of 5 and overall We were both very pleased.Postives:VERY few people.Lots of seats, anytime at pool and beachDinners were A+ Staff seem generally happy and glad to assistRooms are huge and tastefully decoratedMy wife was thrilled with her massageNegitives:The new disco, honestly why open when its not close to being finished? Add to that the music was the loudest I have ever heard.......The breakfast and lunch food was ok at best.The new $5 for 30 mins of internet access is a total joke. It should still be free but if not, at least have some options.The beds are really hard and the pillows also.The cleaning staff is great, IF they show up.

<Content>Bar at the beach My friends and I just arrived back from vacation last week, and we had a BLAST!!!!!! The bar tenders on the beach, Ronny, Murphi  MIke were excellent!!! Not only did they make our time while we were out enjoyable, they also explained to us about life in the Dominican Republic, school, life styles, work. They brought many laughs as well as a good time to everyone!! Keep up the good work. We are looking forward to returning soon!!! Thank You again for a wonderful, safe vacation.Also to note, Hanison Sanchez at La Bodeguita was also wonderful, making sure everyone was taken care of late at night with our snacks..

<Content>Just what we needed! My Boyfriend and I stayed at the Majestic for 8 days, the week of Dec 7-15. All in all I would say for what we wanted it was just perfect! We went into it thinking that the food wouldnt be superb, so we werent really disappointed and were always able to find something we could eat! We liked the French and the Japanese restaurants the best, yumm! And the drinks were always flowing! We definitely had the best bartender, Carlos! Who we visited every night before and after dinner in the downstairs bar by the main lobby. Everyone was very friendly and tried very hard to understand English when possible! The beach was BEAUTIFUL! The waves were crazy and so much fun to play in! The resort was gorgeous in general and all we had wanted was the perfect RR vacation which is what we got! We had a jacuzzi bathtub and on our terrace outside which was awesome just not deep enough! The room was very open, but I guess you deal with it or you dont! I think if anything it helped my boyfriend and I just become even more comfortable with each other then we were before. We came out with lots of pictures and great tans :) We also loved the photo staff, they do a GREAT job at taking pictures and are very nice! Thanks to Lupe for our Sunset Pictures :) I will post pictures when I eventually load them! But overall we liked it here alot, may choose a different resort next time to try out, but wouldnt say no to coming back!!

<Content>just ok my fiance and i stayed the week of dec 8th at majestic colonial,the water and beach were tremendous, the pool was clean and clear, the rooms were cleaned at 5pm which was upsetting,but the room was just fine.the absolute and premium liquers were controlled and readily available.the problem was the food, which just doesnt cut it. breakfast was the best but alot of things were cold. ie. french toast and pancakes.the mexican was awful,the buffet just about average, the steak house and seafood was ok and the french was pretty good, just the dominican food in general was not good as all, we didnt get sick but were bloated all the time andnot from eating too much.it wasour third trip to punta cana and third hotel, it was supposed to be rated number 1 in jpunta cana but far from that maybe number 5.we will stick to jamaica and couples swept away which is a bit more but 5 star.

<Content>Couldn't get enough of it ... Went to attend a family wedding and spend most of the other times hanging around with friends and family, and getting to know the other side of the wedding party. Everything from start to finish was amazing. Booked through Nolitours in Toronto, the one price for all concept was worth it. Transport (air, transfers), hotel, meals, snacks, drinks, entertainment -- you name it ... it was covered! I brought down lots of $1US bills for tips and still came home with lots of cash.The hotel has something for you to do pretty much all the time. But what really impressed me the most was the staff. The hotel obviously conducts quality-service checks often because their staff was phenomenal!From room service, to bartenders, to wait staff, to towel clerks, to front desk to every corner of the resort. There's always someone there to help you and fulfill your needs. There's a daily workout on the beach with the Animation Team that never seems to sleep. If you like to dance, you will LOVE this place! Dancing and music is a common as your own heartbeat. Nothing happens with out dance, music and a smile. Every day there are games and contests where you can win things such as bottles of rum! In case you don't have enough of it on a daily basis, you have the opportunity to bring some home with you.Normally, hotels and resorts have average gyms because they rely on the beach and entertainment to keep people busy and occupied. But this gym was great. A full-time personal trainer, Martires (who's also quite the good looking guy) and his counter-part Walter who is out on the tennis courts are ready to help you 12 hours a day ... every single day.And what's better than starting each day with a huge, massive buffet breakfast? The staff makes it easy for you to wake up to their strong coffee, delicious menu that exceeds anything known to human kind, and the servers are conscientious, polite and always smiling.For the adventurous types there are oodles of places to go and things to do.For the really quiet ones who read on the beach or just enjoy worshipping the sun - there's lots of that too!A place I will definitely be rerturning to ...A.J.

<Content>Loved The People! The resort was excellent, ate a bit 2 much buffet style food and almost got sick of it but the steak house was excellent. I have attached a photo of one of our favorite waiters, he didn't have great english but still found a way to make us laugh constantly. Only complaint really, would be the towel service was too slow. I think they had to take it off site to wash it then bring it back so they were a touch behind on delivery but that is nothing major. They keep the resort in tiptop shape, constantly painting because of the humidity and the service is unreal.

<Content>Great "All-Inclusive"!!! Beautiful weather! Soft white-sand beach! Clean rooms! Very good food! Nice employees!Over the last 15 years I've visited many all-inclusives, including Club Med's, and I have to say this is one of the best. ROOMS: Very clean. No bugs. Bed's not comfy. Bathroom set-up a major negative due to the open floor-plan that leaves nowhere to change. Also the toilet has only a glass door, so there's no privacy. Shower and bathtub/jacuzzi were very big(!). Every day the fridge was stocked with water, beer and soda.BEACH: Awesome white sand and azure water. Plenty of grass huts for guests. A bit of topless bathing that might not be appropriate for families, but they tended to be relatively discreet.POOL: The pool was amazing. It started at one end of the resort and snaked all the way down to the beach. The temperature was crisp and cool, and the depth was about 4-5 ft..Quite frankly, who needs more than that if you're not diving. Towels were plentiful and there were always open huts and chairs.EMPLOYEES: Very friendly. They genuinely seemed to enjoy their jobs. You never felt like you owed anyone a tip, but a dollar here and there was always appreciated.GYM: As someone who frequents a gym daily I found the equipment lacking. There were 3-4 treadmills , a couple weight machines, a universal and some dumb bells. The LCD tv's were a nice touch. Outside the gym was a life-size chess board and a pool table.CASINO: Small, but probably worth visiting if the weather's not cooperating.SHOPS: Typical over-priced stuff---$10 beach balls etc...FOOD: The food was very good. Anyone who has visited all-inclusives understands that something has to be sacrificed-not here, it was quite good. Mexican-Fair to mediocreChinese-Fair to mediocreJapanese-ExcellentSteak House-Very goodSeafood-Try the lobster!Main Buffet-very good, especially the omelet stations in the a.m. and the carving stations in the p.m.! Also plenty of fruit and desserts!!!ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Some good, some bad, Mostly good! We were at the Majestic Colonial for a week, in early December 2008. We were blown away by the sheer beauty of the resort, the rooms, the beach, the pool and the delicious food. The pictures honestly do the place no justice, its just gorgeous. All of the servers, bell boys, maids, etc. were totally wonderful to us during our trip. We took our toddler along with us, and everyone was so welcoming to him, bringing us high chairs, blowing him kisses, giving him high fives, and we always heard Hola Baby everywhere we went. We, as parents, were thrilled to see the staff interact with our child. We spent a lot of time on the beach, during which we met Denny, the Beach Consierge, who was very helpful, friendly and wonderful. Our party was constantly sending him back to the bar with more orders for more drinks. Each time, he was more than willing to get what we needed and wanted, and we always saw him smiling. In the buffet, we all enjoyed everyone. We had the nicest bus boys, whos name I wish I could remember. He told us about how he had a son close to our son's age, and was so helpful and polite. The maids barely knew English, but always smiled at us and said Hola as we'd walk by, especially to the baby. In every single restuarant, my son made friends who were so wonderful. Even willing to take photos with him, I was so impressed with how kind they were to him, and that they treated him like their own son. The only name I remember is Jinny because he spent a lot of time helping us. I wish I remembered more names becuase all of the staff was so wonderful, and I'd love to thank them all personally. The staff in the mornings at the Buffet were just speldid. Im so greatful to have met such wonderful people.I had a few things that really frustrated me during our stay - some days we had the coffee refilled in our room, other days we didnt. We were there Sunday-Sunday and didn't get a facecloth until Thursday. We had several power outages, and one even made the AC not work for about 36 hours. Also, one day we couldn't shower because the shower was not working at all. We had no hot, or cold water. When I dialed down to ask about it, the front desk staff were not very helpful and basically hung up on. The lights and ac are all hardwired so that they shut off when you leave the room, which was fine - but the alarm clock constantly would reset itself, which was a pain to us. Perhaps that could be on a different line. During our stay, we were there for a wedding. The wedding was beautiful, and gorgeous, and the staff did a lot to make sure it was that way. However, due to a power outage, the reception started almost an hour and a half later than it was supposed to. When 11 pm came around, the night was over, even though the bridge and groom had paid for so many hours, and lost out. I did not think that was fair at all, especially since we were in a private area, and not causing anyone inconvience. The next day, there was a wedding right next to the pool, and they were still partying after midnight, and someone was singing into the microphone, so it was really loud and echoed through the entire resort. I phoned to ask when it would be stopped, and the front desk hung up on me. I continously called back as I had needed a wake up call for the next day, and never did get through. I thought that was horrible of them, and I was very angry about the wedding being so loud and allowed to go so late in a public area, and being hung up on. I was not pleased with the front area staff during the entire trip. The one time we did have a wake up call to get up to leave for an excursion, it was 15 minutes late. The entertainment was great, I loved the shows I did get to see, the bars were amazing, the music was wonderful, the vendors market was a good safe way to shop, the pool was clean, the free programs were amazing. I did the aqua fitness class with a young man, I beleived named Romeo. He was originally from Haiti, thats all I knew about him. He was very involved with the group, had a great sense of humour and was excellent with the participants. I enjoyed everything about the entertainment and things that were offered to the guests.I went off the resort for the Safari tour, and I'd highly recomend that to anyone. It was worth it to see how Dominican life is. Im so thankful that I was at the Majestic Colonial, despite the few problems that we had, we had a great trip, we met a lot of wonderful people, and we as a couple had a great time, as well as our son. We were so happy and comfortable all week, we loved the food, the drinks, the whole atmosphere. I would recomend this resort (and have already) to anyone interested in Punta Cana. My only wish is that the week went on, and on, and on.. and wasnt over already!

<Content>Great holiday but hotel needs to sort its food out! Arrived at the hotel on Monday 24th Decemeber Aprox 4.30pmThe reception area looks nothing like the photo in the brochure or website but it was ok. When we checked in the staff new nothing about our booking being linked with our friends and the receptionist told us nothing about the hotel like the other receptionist were telling other guests. Bell boy took our bags to the bedroom and we followed behind. Got stuck in the lift next our bedroom and then when we walked into the bedroom the maid was still cleaning the room! and the maintance man was in there fixing a light!Bedrooms: Are nice and big, Aircon wasn't always working, Toilet was blocked and took 3days for them to finally fix, had to wait 2 days for extra pillows. Room wasn't cleaned until 4pm everyday which I think is very late.Food: Not good at all breakfast was ok but there were only 2 toasters for the whole hotel which is a complete joke! Lunch and dinner was always cold! nice selection but always cold!!!!A la carte restaurants were interesting! The steak house shouldn't even bother to serve food because it's awful cold, staff ignored you. The Chinese and French were very good!Swimming pools: Brilliant!!!!!Entertainment Team: Worked there socks off!!! fantasticTrips: Tropical Storm is brilliant!!! day out on a boat! and saonau island is beautiful. Both worth every penny!After going to Mexico last year the standard is just not the same! beautiful weather though! Very poor country and the airport is something else! your no what i mean when you see it!!!Wouldn't go back but only because there are too many places in the world to go back to the same place.

<Content>A Great Trip We attended our newphew's wedding the first week of December. Our accomadations were excellent. We especially enjoyed the beautiful beach and the pool. A particular bartender by the name of Victor was excellent, pleasant, efficient and provided service over and above his duties. We also enjoyed the dance lessons. The entertainment could have been elevated a level or two. We have recommended the resort to some of our friends who are planning a trip to Punta Cana. a Couple from Point Edward

<Content>A detailed review of the Hotel and our Wedding Hello everyone,This is a LONG and detailed review. My husband and I (along with 27of our friends and family) stayed at the Majestic Colonial from about November 27th to December 6th. (Our arrival and departure dates varied by two days) We planned this group vacation because we were having a wedding. I will write this review in two parts, the first focusing on the vacation and the second focusing on the wedding.THE VACATION:Overview: The hotel is beautiful. It is very well maintained. The property is clean and well groomed. It is located on a beautiful section of beach. The staff are very friendly and helpful. If you have any questions or issues, they are definitely happy to assist.Food: There is a wide variety of food. It's true, after a week the food can seem a little boring. But, they do a good job on trying to ensure there is some variety. There are a number of restaurants. I did not get a chance to try all of them. However, I did try the grill, the buffets (the main buffet and the beach buffet), the 'French' restaurant and the Taino restaurant. All of them had a fairly good selection of food. But, the food itself can be hit or miss. Some foods are great and others - not so much. My best advice, try a little of everything. (I am not particularly picky, I'm willing to try most foods at least once. If you have a strong stomach and a willingness to try foods, this is a good approach) Since the food can be repetitive throughout the week within a day or two, you'll know what's good and not so good. I really enjoyed the burgers at the beach side restaurant, but I didn't enjoy the hot dogs or french fries there.... You really just have to try it out. My husband had a really difficult time with the food. He is generally a really finicky eater. If you know that you are picky, take a few things with you that you know you like and that are easy to transport, ie. granola bars, chocolate.I do have to tell you, a number of us did suffer with the runs. I would say about half of us were dependent on Immodium and Pepto Bismol for at least one day. In my case - three days (that's what I get for trying everything).The Rooms: We stayed in the room 2253 - it's an Oceanview room that's a little larger than the standard rooms. It is located on the 2nd floor. The view is beautiful. We encountered a few issues with bugs - but it is to be expected, it is the Caribbean after all. There were lots of little ants and there were definitely some mosquitoes. My advice for the rooms - make sure that you have insect repellent! You will need it. Some of the people who were staying with us on the ground floor had many mosquitoes in their rooms and suffered with many bites. I'm not sure if it was because of the time of year - just coming out of the rainy/hurricane season. Or, if they hadn't sprayed for mosquitoes yet. But, please be careful, and make sure you have a good bug spray, especially if you're traveling with kids/babies. And, one of our friends made friends with a cockroach that was staying with the during their stay. They couldn't bring themselves to kill it, for whatever reason.Aside from that, our room was clean and in good condition. From what I saw of the other rooms, a few were starting to look a little tired. Some had a few cracks in the walls, and the seals on the doors to the toilets/showers were starting to come off. I can't say that it bothered me. But, if you are really finicky and have a very specific idea of what a 5 star should be like, this may not be what you're thinking about.Staff: The cleaning staff were amazing! They did a fabulous job cleaning our room. We left a tip everyday for her. She made all kinds of towel creations for us. We always had clean towels and a full bar. The front desk were incredibly helpful and the maintenance staff were very friendly. An A1 team of hardworking people!Beach: Absolutely beautiful! I loved the beach. The sand was white and soft. The water was turquoise and beautiful. I just loved it. You can go for long walks. The week that we were there, it was quite busy. But there were lots of seats and palapas. You shouldn't have any problems finding a spot to relax.The pool: I have to tell you, I'm not a huge fan of pools on vacation. But, I will say that it was a massive pool. There were tonnes of places to sit and hang out. And, our friends who hung out at the pool really enjoyed it.THE WEDDING:We went to the M.C. for our wedding. We started planning our wedding there over a year ago. During that time we were in communication with Larissa. She had been the wedding planner there for a number of years. Unfortunately, she had left just before we got there. I believe that the transition wasn't as smooth as it could be, so we encountered a number of issues.I will say this to the brides who are thinking of having a wedding there. Despite the issues that you may have communicating, you will have a great wedding. But, it may not be quite what you expected. If I had to do it all over, I may have considered going somewhere else. I had spent a LOT of time planning and thinking about the details of the wedding. I had sent everything to Larissa over the course of a year, and she had promptly responded to every email that I had. However, about two or three months before the wedding, my wedding planners here in Toronto from LUXE sent me an email informing me that Larissa was no longer the wedding coordinator at the resort. Unfortunately, the resort did not send me any further information.Over the year, I had sent all of the details to Larissa, including information about bouquets, centerpieces, food/menus, cake flavour and style, chair covers, table cloths... you name it I sent pictures and information of what I wanted. When I arrived, I found that they didn't have ANY of the information that I had spent hours putting together. In fact, they only had the information from the very first email that I sent over a year ago. I was really surprised and because I had sent everything to them so long in advance I didn't think I needed to bring everything with me. I was really disappointed and frustrated. I know now that I should have brought everything with me despite feeling like I was so organized.***Anything that you want PLEASE make sure you send them the details and keep copies of everything that you sent.I even sent an email a week before I arrived, but no one responded to me. I figured that I would deal with everything once I arrived. I tried not to stress out too much about it.The day of my wedding I had no clue what was going on. No one bothered to fill me in on the itinerary for the day, or what was going to happen. I had no menus as to what was being served, or what the bar was going to look like. I had to call them a number of times to ask for details. And I had to call FOUR times to get a pair of scissors to finish wrapping gifts for my guests. These gifts became the centerpieces since the wedding planners forgot about ordering centerpieces for the wedding reception.Flowers: They were beautiful. However, as I mentioned they forgot to order centerpieces. They didn't have any pictures of the kinds of flowers that could be ordered. And the pictures that I had sent previously were no where to be found. I just ended up picking a tropical bouquet.Ceremony: We had the ceremony on the beach. It was beautiful. I couldn鈥檛 have asked for a more perfect location.Photographer: We used the resort photographer. He was okay. That鈥檚 the best that I can give the photographer and the photographs. We chose the 鈥淏ronze Package鈥?since our friend, Shaun, who was in our wedding party is an actual professional photographer and was going to do the rest of the photos for the reception. The photos that the photographer took were okay, at best. Some of the 鈥淧hotoshopped鈥?ones were really cheesy. There were a few that they had put writing on, that had spelling errors. We all thought it was entertaining. But, if these are the photos that you are relying on, they my not be what you had hoped for, especially if you want to send them to for friends and family. They also did a hard sell of additional photos. We saw the digital images on computer first. The images on the computer were bright and beautiful. The prints were very disappointing. And, the CD images were very small files that would be very difficult to blow- up to anything larger than a 5x7 photo. Our photographer friend (Shaun) had to go and speak with the photographers at the resort and asked for the large files of the images so that he could work on them at home. If you want to keep your photos bring a flash drive, with at least 2GB on it. If you need to have some work done of them or, want to have them enlarged at least you have the entire file image.Videographer: He was really nice. The end product was a tad cheesy, but it was fine. I am actually quite amused by the video and know that whoever sees it will likely get a few laughs from it. Bartenders: Our bartenders for the evening were AMAZING! They were so fun. They really made the people at our wedding smile and kept things lively. Servers: Awesome! They were great. They made sure that the food looked amazing. They made sure there was an endless supply of food. DJ: I do recommend bringing your own IPod. We did. We also got a DJ to take care of the music for when people arrived at the reception and so that we wouldn鈥檛 have to continuously be poking our IPod, instead of just having fun. 20 minutes into the reception he went MIA. I had to go to reception and get them to 鈥渇ind鈥?him. They made a few calls, and eventually he showed up again. Janet at reception was awesome at locating him and sent him back to do his job. Thank you again.Food: The food was amazing. It is way better than what they serve at the buffet. There was beef, fish, lobster, chicken and all kinds of salads and desserts. The food was DELICIOUS!I wish that the wedding coordinator was better at managing client expectations. If they provided detailed information about the elements of the wedding ie. food, decorations and an itinerary for the day, it would have made me much less worried and it would have made the whole experience much more pleasant. Hopefully they will read this and future brides will benefit! All the best in selecting your hotel and/or wedding destination.

<Content>Great Resort for true beach lovers Although this is my second review on TA,I have traveled to the carribean many many times. This is my first All Inclusive stay at a resort. I am used to a 5 Star resort, this was not that......However the effort the workers bring on an every day basis does make up for the short comings of the resort on a whole.............Because of all the great advise i read on this site i will give a detailed HONEST review and try to help others in making a decision on there vacation.Airport: Arrival was fine, after walking off plane you head to an open aired building to pay your visitor fee { american money ). Then ther are many workers trying to grab your luggage, you find your tour bus desk and recieve your return voucher, ( You validate this at hotel) and your on the bus (air conditioned) and at the hotel in 40 min.Check-in: No prob here, asked for a room in the 200 bld pool view, ( Thanks AnnMarie ) recieved my Majestic drink, bell hop grabbed bags, and we were off to the room, The first impression of the resort is WOW!!!! WOW!!!!! I can't belive im here... the grounds are beautiful.....music playing...people coming and going....you cant wait to get into the flow....Room: (2326) pool view about half way between main lobby and beach, good location and easy access to pool, main buffet and the fantastic beach...the room is as advertised, very large. Bath room is open to the rest of the room with a frosted pane of glass seperating the shower area as well as the toilet area, ( I traveled with my wife and 16 yr old daughter, we had no privacy issues) The room has wear and tear, and the two twin beds were not to comfy, The AC with the ceiling fan cooled the room just fine. The maid service was fin, they cleaned the room daily, at different times (prob because we left the room at different times each morning) we had some towel animals made for us (cruise like) and the mini bar was restocked every day but one. (not sure why).The view from the terrace was great i was able to see the ocean (while leaning over my balcony and looking really hard) and the full pool (about 3 football fields long) Just Amazing.......Food: The steak house was our first stop, we all had the steak and it was great, side sauces amazing, , great service,no prob at all. didnt try the seafood place. (but while sitting and drinking by the bar i saw a couple enjoy both , one after another, bet they liked the all inclusive lmao) We at all our breakfasts at the main buffet, the food vaired, they had all the usual, bacon ,sasuage, ham potatoes...so on so on....The food is held by overhead lights no a steam table so it is warm at best..you can get fresh eggs anyway you want cooked to order...as well as a crepe station...(fastest crepe maker in the world). Coffee is dark (ask for a half and half, 1/2 milk 1/2 coffee) I really cant say anything bad about the buffett The service was great and the food tasted fine...They served breakfest at the beach place alsoo each day...... I didn't like the jap place, maybe i expected too much (after reading reviews here) The Le Gourmet..........Was not Gourmet........service was fine......We ate lunch each day at the beach place, and they cooked 2 times on the sand....paella, and tacos........both were Excellent.....The food in the beach resturant... was very good Hamburgers, dogs, pasta station...made to order.....grilled meats and fish.....a salad bar and a desert bar, and a Panani sandwich maker....Service was great everyday and the food was very tasty...The funny thing is that i didn't wan't too try Tainio there mex/dr resturant (after reading reviews on here) the last night i did and WOW food was Great.....go figure............They had snacks set up each night at the entrance to the main lobby and a daily drink....I did however frequent the after hour snack place ....food was good late night (drank all day) munch food....lol...........Beach: AMAZING.........plenty of palapas all day (and night) water is a little rough (must watch the kids) The views are great and it was nice to take long walks during the day....or just lay around...There was service on the sand for drinks..after a couple they new what to bring ya...( i drank the beer mostly on the beach) and loved it....they have nonmoterized sports (no charge) and little speed boats (to rent), massage,hair braiding,and painted tatoos are available..( again for a fee). There is a constant breeze with makes it not too hot to hang all day......Pool: Tried too lay one day but without the breeze it was too hot to get the sun...I did go to the pool bar which was nice to get a drink and mingle......( BIG SHOUT OUT to my new friends from the Mid West.......Congrats on your up coming wedding). The area next to the pool bar is where you can find the most going on until 6pm, Thats where the Anamation team sets up, mostly a younger group...There are different spots in the pool with whirlpools ( they are attached to pool , there not hot) its fun to swim the entire legnth (or walk) .......pool was closed a 6pm each day , which i thought was strange, was still light at 6pm.....but maybe because there is no life guard , and all the Booze going around somebody thought this to be a good idea....I did tooo....Bars: There are 9, though out the resort from the beach to the main lobby........MY FAV WAS THE BEACH bar....( SHOUT OUT to Carlos,Wandy and Jose.............me hombres forever).

<Content>"Interesting" My wife and I have traveled for many years and this hotel had its ups and downs but certain qualities bugged us the most.First the ups... The hotel staff could not have been nicer. From the bar folks to the waiters to the front desk. we were very pleased with the attitude and service all around.we mainly ate at the buffets even though I really don't like eating that way because cold food is real cold and hot food is very cold. The selection of foods at the beach buffet was very limited. The other buffet near the front lobby was larger and better selections by far.The service at the buffets were amazing. The drinks kept coming until you told them to stop and the minute you were done with your plate, they came to remove it. Very fast service. By the third or fourth day the drink waiters knew what you were drinking at each meal.Our room was fine. It was clean and everyday the minibar was stocked with soda and water. Now the down part -- When you check in they give you two towel cards and that is all you are allowed to get. TWO towels? ONE towel per person. This is insane. we ended up taking our towels from our room and using them and asking for more from our room attendant. The food at the buffet was cold for the most part no matter where you went. The fries were soggy most of the time. Nobody really understands much English so dont try to ask for any food done differently,,, they won;t understand.ICE... They turn off ALL the ice machines around 10:30 at night. Let me repeat that... They turn off ALL the ice machines around 10:30 at night. That is also nuts especially in weather like this. If you want ice then you must walk to the main bars and fill your ice bucket that way. Room service also stops at around 11:00pm.I recommend you bring a large cup for your drinks and keep it for the duration of your trip. Although you can get as many drinks as you like, you will be served in small plastic cups and you will be glad you brought your big mug from home. They gladly fill them up no matter what size they are so bring the big insulated one!and finally let me say that the staff here are happy and pleasant and never say no. except for the casino workers ,everyone here is great. The casino people speak no English and are rude and not nice at all. It also smells for some reason. we will come back here and recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to eat and drink,. The food quality isn't first class but by no means is it bad. If you can deal with buffets then you will be fine and happy with the selections.Hope this helps.. Happy and safe travels

<Content>Wouldn't recomended it to Anyone There were a lot of mix ups from the beginning. Rooms were mixed up and people weren't in the system. The majority of our good had to change rooms or make up grades. Some of us didn't bother or want the hassle. My room - walls were dirty, faucets falling apart, tub plug didn't work, shower door wouldn't close. Beds were hard and I could change the tempurature of the air conditioning.I found that for your rooms to be cleaned it didn't matter the amount of tip you left the service was all the same. I think they might have mopped our floors twice. Also some of our groups rooms weren't cleaned by 5:00pm.The food was average but be choosy on where you go. We went to the Japanese with reservations and I found it very salty which was odd because everyother place we ate lacked.The French restaurant was good was well as the carribian/domincan which is located right beside the french.My favourite part was the pool and the beach.This was my first all inclusive so I should have ahd lower expectation but with reading all the reviews that claimed this place was so fantastic I was really dissapointed.I wish that I had taken pictures of the rooms to give and idea.

<Content>Found the Majestic Colonial below average My husband and I just returned from a week stay at the Majestic Colonial. The staff were great. Maria, Fransisco and Wander were on top of things. The resort is a bit tired and in need of some up grades. We immediately asked for a room change as we were right by the theatre and disco...Very noisy! The room we were given was very quiet but again in need of paint and new bedding, The beds are very hard and old. The food was very, very average. Got pretty boring after day 3. Same spread every day. The grounds, however, are beautiful and well groomed.We have been to many all-inclusives so have a good idea of what 5 star would be and this a 3.5. Hope this helps ;T and J

<Content>Good Week, Just Know What To Expect If you are like me and read a lot of reviews prior to booking, hopefully this will help.I booked a week at the Majestic Colonial based on the overall ratings and a general feeling from all the reviews. Having travelled pretty extensively to a lot of locations, I have a pretty realistic view when it comes to a vacation. The reviews that you read that are either AWFUL or ABSOLUTELY PERFECT..well, they either have never travelled before, or are drinking the punch - so to speak.Rooms - I had a Junior Suite - Ocean View. Best part of the trip, in my opinion. Yes the mattress is a bit tired, but it's a beautiful room with a great, stylish bathroom and a view of the ocean. The Bathroom is less than private - and if that's not your style, then go to the HOliday Inn. Mine was #3150. I could walk right out my patio door on to the beach. Yes - the room has a slight musty smell IT'S THE ISLANDS - IT'S 85% humidity! What do you expect? Also, this resort is on the planet earth, and unless you've been living in a bubble for your life, there are bugs on earth. So if you see a bug, do not assume the place is infested... just flatten the thing, toss it, and go back to relaxing.Food - Again - Know what to expect. Most of the food you eat will be from a buffet. The hardest part of a buffet is to keep food hot, all the time....and it's not. Most meals were luke-warm. If you're smart and avoid risky foods (lettuce, chicken, etc) you will be fine. But if you choose to eat anything, then don't complain about sitting on the can for the duration of your trip. OUt of the 3 of us that traveled, not one of us had a single problem, because we were smart. Skip the Taino restaurant, and book the Le Gourmet for as many times as possible. Terrific food, terrific menu, best meals by far... The Japanese steakhouse is very good, but remember - he's Dominican, not Japanese... if you order Chinese food in Alberta, don't expect it to be purely authentic.. 10-4?Pools - They're cool, refreshing, and well... a pool. Nice shape, swim up bar is handy. lots of room to cool down out of the sun.Staff - Friendly, most speak English just fine. Maintenance guys do a bang-up job of keeping the place tidy and attractive. Any encounters I had with the front desk were terrific. One young lady was extremely helpful when I checked out.General Comments; Remember it's an all-inclusive. They're going to serve you cheap booze, and lots of it. Don't go down expecting to have the best drinks...just expect free drinks. Ask for the Smirnoff if you're a vodka drinker. And if you're not a big drinker, don't be shocked to find out that some people there are. You'll be sure to have some dude in a straw hat completely blasted by 2 pm, yelling like a fool by the swim-up bar. That's the benefit to the size of the place - go somewhere else. And if you are that guy in the hat... cheers, enjoy yourself. (I wasn't the guy in the hat, by the way).Don't go expecting a Vegas Casino either - a few one-armed bandits, 2 roulette tables, 2 blackjack tables, 2 Carribean Poker tables... and that's it. All in all we had a good time. Everything was fine. out of 10 we'd give it 8 - 8.5. No real complaints. It is a bit down the beach in terms of location. It's about a 2 and a half hour walk round trip to the straw market (to the right, by the way). The beach is supreme, lots of spots to sit and cook. If you are Canadian through Signature Vacations, and are north of about 5'11, pay the extra and go in the StarClass seats. Didn't on the way down, HAD TO on the way home because I simply DID NOT fit in the standard seat....plus the drinks are free, so it lessens the blow.If Punta Cana is your choice of destination, you won't regret the choice, just don't expect to be blown away by a 5 star location...it's a quality 4+.. and dependable at that.Oh, and to the extremely RUDE wedding group down there from the 20th-27th of Nov.. may we never cross paths again. Learn some manners and decency...

<Content>Great hotel with some bumps This is going to lengthy. On the whole this is a great resort, but they do have some things to work on to be a 5 star. Some of the reviews below are off the wall. We spent 7 days at this resort and the animation team is out of this world. Whoever said all they do is play drinking games and have bikini contests is exaggerating hugely. In the week we were there I saw 1 drinking game and 1 bikini contest. I should also mention we were there with our 10yr old daughter and my 16yr old daughter and her friend. OUr kids had a fantastic time. They had funny games twice a day, dancing lessons, aerobics, ping pong challanges and scrabble. These activities occured on a daily basis. The animation crew came around and spent time with any guests who were interested in this. My kids loved them. These staff members work from 10am to 1am every day and they never run out of energy. In my opinion they are by far the best part of this resort. Please remember to tip if you feel they have worked for it. It is one area that people forget about. This whole team is wonderful.We arrived 3 hours late due to a flight delay. We travelled with Nolitours. Don't make the mistake in thinking that you are getting anything extra with this tour company. It is false advertising. You can get a cheaper golf rate from the hotel...there rooms are in the 3rd building which in my opion is the worst of all of them and you do not get 1 st choice of dinner reservations. It's all bull. We requested 2 rooms next to each other in the 2 building. I requested this with Nolitours and with AnneMarie from the hotel directly. When we arrived at midnight and went to our room we were at opposite ends of the building 3. We were told to speak to a manager the next morning. We spoke to Hilario and he arranged for us to be in building 2 close to the beach overlooking the pool. We were very happy with the new location. The rooms are gorgeous. Yes you have to be careful on the floors when wet, but thats the case anywhere in the carribean, not isolated to this hotel only.The service at this hotel on the whole is great. The management team, animation team, pool bartenders (especially Rosa), the lower level lobby bartenders, waiters in Japanese, Chinese, DOminican,Breakfast buffet and Gourmet are great. We had superb service at these places.Now for the bad service. The Seafood restaurant is the worst. They are almost rude in here and don't like to give out extra food. It is an all inclusive and you should be able to order what you want as you can in any other restaurant. We heard complaints from others about this restaurant, but went with an open mind. Well we agreed with what everone said. We also didn't really enjoy the steakhouse service. The food was good but we were really rushed. We are on vacation and live extremely busy lives. The last thing we want to do on vacation is rush. The lunch buffet by the beach was very slow or nonexistant.The other area were the service is bad is the upstairs lobby bar. The main bartender there does ignore you when you are waiting to order a drink. I got fed up and walked away and never went back to it. Its too bad he is like that because he makes a mean Mojito. The other main complaint was they ran out of things a couple of times. For instance they ran out of fresh mint for 3 days, and ran out of bananas twice for the remaining part of that day.The appearance of this resort is beautiful. They are for ever cleaning everywhere, so much so that my husband and I would joke about it. The beach is the nicest in Punta Cana. It goes on forever and the sea is beautiful colors of blue. We unfortuanetly had some bad weather while we were there but we could get into the ocean everyday but one.No one in our party got sick, but we did hear of some people who had stomach problems. We were just careful about buffet food and didn't overinduldge in alcohol.I should mention they have photographers taking pictures all week. They do an amazing job. We ended spending alot of money on some great photos. If they take your picture make sure you stop by the photo shop to see them. We were really happy with this service. Overall we had a great vacation. Yes there were some problems but we were on vacation so we didnt let them bother us too much. If you are looking for problems you can find them anywhere. We would return to this resort again if we were guaranteed the 2nd building. If they work on the service in some areas I would definitely give it 5 stars. It was a great vacation for the price.

<Content>A Majestic Experience This was our Frist trip to the Dominican Republic and The wife and I used Trip advisor to review a list of hotels. We came across the Majestic and it was a good thing we did. From the time we checked in to our 1 week stay it was fantastic. Lets start by looking at the rooms, we were on the first floor near the entertainment centre. We stayed in the Junior sweet with a sitting area outside. The rooms were excellent and well maintained. Nothing at all to complain about, the maid service was performed daily. We did however have a slight issue with the in room safe to which hotel maint. came in and fixed it right away. We love the Ocean and rarely went pool side, from what we saw of the pool area it appeared to be be in excellent condition.The Beach area is kept extremely clean. And there was an abundance of water and non water sports. IF you have kids there are quite a few topless women on the beach so a word of warning. ** if you're an adrenaline junkie give the speed boats a try they're extremely fun.**The shows were great. As we were coming in on Sunday Night there was a Madonna impersonator, 70's and 80's night, Michael jackson, Dating game and a circus type event. If you feel like trying your luck give the Casino a try. The in hotel Casino was pretty cool.The Drinks were free flowing and it was a constant struggle not to get loaded. I recomend the Mojitos. The Food was excellent, we tried the local buffet which was nice but our fav by far was the Japaneese restaurant. The Food along with the Show was fantastic. The French Restaurant was good. Beach Grill always had great food along with a variety of foods at the buffet for lunch.The main Buffet hall had a wide range of Continental foods. Food was spiced right and for a guy who has a sensative stomach i didn't have any problems for the duration of the week.I do encourage you on your first day to book your restaurants in advance as they do tend to fill up quickly.The snack bar was decent at best. Hamburgers and Hotdogs just didn't taste the same as they do back home.The service was great all week. The staff was friendly, I had to practically beg most of the staff to take Tips. There was this one waiter who made our stay extremely comfortable for all restuarants.Along with Bicycles, Archery, Tennis, local shops and internet, This hotel has everything you could ask for. I would recomend this for anyone looking to getaway for RR. One note if you're looking for thriving late late night life look elsewhere.Hope this helps, AP

<Content>Majestic hotel, Putan Cana-awful I'm assuming all these people who rave about the Majestic are single or without young children (even then it's questionable). My husband and I have traveled extensively and have always stayed at 4 or 5 star hotels. This hotel is not anywhere close to a 4 or 5 star hotel. The first room we had was tiny with broken furniture and absolutely no privacy in the bathroom area. We have two girls 4 and 8. We were told to change in the shower! The curtains are stained and old and the mattresses were terrible. We were upgraded to a bigger room but not much better. The first bed my daughter sat on broke and fell to the floor.The food is soooooooooooooooo bad!!! There is no Italian Restaurant which the hotel advertises there is and the Mexican and Japanese Restaurants are awful. Therefore, we had to eat buffet in the same two places everyday for a week. The French restaurant doesn't permit kids under 12.The pool area has broken concrete all over the place and there is nothing at all for children. Bikini contests, drinking contests, etc. go on daily.The Kids Club which is outside has no sprinklers (it's very hot) and the swings are broken.It's difficult to find many employees who speak English and/or who give you correct information.The shows are not even mediocre.There is absolutely nothing to do and you cannot venture off the grounds. There are only 3 or 4 tiny shops which are ridiculously expensive.To top off everything, I saw a rat running freely on the grounds.From what I witnessed, the majority of guests are big time drinkers without children and Europeans who don't wear tops. Lovely atomosphere for kids. I think the Majestic needs to make a decision about who they cater to and stop advertising falsely. I wouldn't go back there if they offered me a free trip. Waste of time, waste of money...next year Aruba!!!

<Content>Best Pool in DR Stayed here in Oct 08. We have been to DR 6 times Mexico 5 times and Jamaica so will provide a review based on our overall travels.Hotel Overall: Excellent - The grounds are immaculate. Staff are fabulous, the Dominican people are so nice generally but staffing here is very very good. Rooms cannot be faulted, very good standard, large balcony, mini bar with soft drinks, water and beers (tip a few bucks each day and a note if you require extras), Ice bucket, coffee maker and coffee, herbal teas, sugar, creamer (bring some t-bags if you love your cuppa, there's never enough black/breakfast tea in rooms or buffet). Ice machines on ground floor near lifts. We had a standard room 3440 which we loved, 3rd floor no-one above us here with a great view of beach and main pool bar (which offered great amusement around 4pm lol). It was a fair walk from the lobby  main buffet but not only did it help with all those calories but we much preferred the beachfront bar on an evening with the sea breeze, also they were happy to give you full cups of liquor to take away at the end of the evening for your nightcap in room etc if you asked. The Pool FANTASTIC!!! It's such a great pool, always loads of beds available at all times, bars at each end, 2 big jacuzzi's in pool, swim from the lobby end of hotel all the way to the beach (only one little wall to either climb over or round) a great place if your a water baby like me. Beach is great, very very pretty, no rocks etc in water but the waves and current are very strong in October so be careful not to go too far out.Can't comment on shows as we didn't bother with them as they are all about the same in the DR but there is an nightly film in the sports bar which is handy.My only 2 very slight problems are regarding the food. Firstly in the buffet a lot of the food is not always very warm, unless it's from the cooking stations which are always excellent but don't get me wrong the food is very good and loads of choice and secondly the service at the steakhouse is very erratic (we were given our 2nd and main course together and another table were given 3 courses at once. Don't let this put you off though as we enjoyed the steaks very very much but if you know before you go that this can happen you wont be worried by it (we went twice and it was the same both times).We would go back to this resort again without hesitation. Hope this helps as I use TA to help me with my hotel choices loads.

<Content>Majestic 5 star nightmare J  B Thompson - Booking ref: 0312/39816Told [--] and majestic about this and heard nothing. Gave them 1 week to respond but didnt so here is the review.Other hotels PR feel free to spread the word.Flight delayed by 2 hours going over but it was ok as you expect things like this. We paid an extra 拢130 each (拢260 total) to go premium so we wouldnt have to stand in queues which we didnt going over but coming back to UK we were stood in massive queue for over 1 hour in sweltering dom rep heat. NOT WORTH THE MONEY ! Screaming baby in premium cabin before takeoff and most of the flight, same child coming back screaming again. People had paid premium to get sleep. Most people had to be up for work next day. Shouldnt allow babies in premium cabin !!!!Got to hotel and 1st day wife discovered outside loo's were covered in excrement all the way down the path and all over the toilet pretty much everywhere but in it. ok we thought...not hotels fault, this was obviously someone caught very short probably a child or something. 2nd day noticed that the meat chef was handling cooked chicken with the same tongs as he was handling raw chicken so reported salmonella risk to manager and they then fired wrong person. Spent most of 3rd day getting poor guy his job back  asking them not to fire the actual person responsible but simply retrain them in basic food hygiene or move them to a pasta bar. Met numerous people who had spent approx 1 third of their holiday on the loo with severe diarohhea or in full time in bed with suspected food poisoning. Starting to get worried now. Wife tried to book anniversary surprise through a hotel staff girl called MADELEINE who was pregnant and about to leave soon. Next day i realised why my wife was so upset... Blase Madeleine who troubled me from the moment i met her upon noticing she was the exact double for the actress from ugly betty without the braces hadnt bothered with the room decor arrangement infact we didnt even get an anniversary banner on our door until the last couple of days which we had to keep asking for. Said that they dont do that, but have read that they did. Caught out as a liar as we got a banner eventually (2 days before leaving) Rubbish Lobby bar man called MAXIMO who will completely ignore you despite waiting ages for a drink. A swim up bar where everyone appears to just pee in the water and never leave their stools (no pun intended) for fear of losing their place or the evidentally too long 1 minute walk to the loo's. Hotel needs to get urine reactor dye in pool to discourage this. 1 week into our 2 week holiday and our very 1st anniversary is RUINED !, thought it couldnt get any worse until next day the sliding balcony door fell in on us and smashed which could have killed one of us especially if a child was there. Saw manager and insisted on being treated like royalty for our last week as the hotel had ruined our 1st anniversary together. They tried to flog us off with a free dinner on the beach which we should have had anyway, insisted on a better room which was a start but then after that no more gestures to make our holiday feel remotely special. .Our final and third room was 3407 after 2 inconvenient moves.Every morning my wife and I like to have a coffee before we left the apartment but quite often if the maid had even bothered to replace the powdered milk, it was hard and didnt even melt when put into the hot coffee, so went out as usual to try and find a maid when i heard screaming and shouting on the ground floor. Approximately 5 maids and 3 other hotel staff were holding up one of the cleaners to the sky in what looked like some kind of bizarre voodoo ritual... she said that she has passed out with the heat but she was acting all weird with her eyes rolling around in her head like they do on the TV documentaries when theyre pretending to be possessed. They were then doing the heimlich manouvre on her which kind of summed up their first aid knowledge. It was making me cringe and very angry at the same time however my weird  dark sense of humour at this point could not resist shouting down for some more milk. Hotel management came about 10 minutes later and took her away. She was back to work within minutes. I kind of get the impression the hotel don't mess with the maids from superstitious fear of their ridiculous voodoo claims and haiti origins. If you read this review  still go then you deserve everything that happens to you. It really makes no odds to us. We wanted to do a good thing as we do every year and put some money into a 3rd world country but their idea of 5 star and your idea of 5 star will be greatly different i assure you.If you like waiting ages for your meal  drinks  then have the orders all messed up when they DO finally arrive, this is the hotel for you. I feel i have a civil duty to warn people about the potential death threat looming over this establishment and now thomson are aware of it so when it DOES happen, the victim/s will at least have some legal comaback. This is a shame because there were a lot of really nice staff. The animation/entertainment team were brilliant and the other (not the swim up bar) pool was lovely and warm. The seona trip was expensive but enjoyed doing it, but half of the holiday and the premium upgrade was not. We are now seeking full refund on the premium upgrade and half of the cost for the 2 weeks there. Met a couple who were accused of not paying for a bottle of wine  were embarrassed in front of an entire restaurant, fortunately they had kept the receipt. Also met a couple who had cockroaches in their room and it took the hotel 1 week to move them to a different room which was eventually an adjoining room to a screaming baby, so basically they just swapped the complaining occupants over. I spent most of my time for entertainments sake sat at the bottom of the pool with an empty plastic cup waving to the scuba divers and freaking them out. Really wish our 1st anniversary was spent elsewhere.Dead drowned body of a woman washed up on the beach in broad daylight which upset everyone on the beach including one of our friends who went down to beach to get one last look at it before leaving. I Told management that it would probably be a good idea to have someone patrolling the beach in the early hours as there would probably be more floating across from the cuban hurricane but they didnt. Overall conclusion...WONT be going back EVER and wont ever use THOMSON again either! We really regret not going back to the excellence in cancun mexico which really was a 5 star experience. It was perfect. I have never ever written a review before as have always had good holidays. The Majestic Colonial put an end to all that. Visit it at your own peril ! TOTAL waste of money !

<Content>definately 5 star We stayed at the Colonial Nov16-23, 2008. It was gorgeous. The gardens are lovely. The rooms were amazing. No bugs anywhere. The main buffet had white linen tablecloths with lovely silver and white china. The beach is beautiful and clean. The pool is not deep so you can walk around in it comfortably. The staff would bend over backward to try and get you what you need. There are 600 rooms and yet you werent fighting for beach chairs or standing in line at the buffet and no bumping elbows with any one. There were no singles really, mostly honeymoon couple and it was fairly quiet. Great place for a wedding and there were many. The food in the steakhouse and seafood restaurants were really good. It wasnt crazy with stuff to do like sports although they had a great animation team doing exercises in the morning. Waiters on the beach. All was good.I will recomend it to family and friends.

<Content>Wonderful Time at the Colonial My husband and I, along with my sister and her husband were originally booked into the Majestic Elegance from Nov. 14th to the 21st. A couple of days before hand, we were advised by the travel company that the hotel would not be open and that we had been booked into the Colonial. A bit of disappointment, but we had seen the reviews of the Colonial so we were not worried.Well, we never should have been worried - the hotel was absolutely wonderful from the minute we arrived to the end of our stay.We were taken to our rooms, which overlooked the Elegance. Not so bad if the hotel was finished, but the first morning my husband and I stepped onto the balcony and were welcomed by waves from the construction workers. Very polite, but kind of a shock. That day, my husband and brother-in-law secretively went to the front desk and arranged a room change to a pool view and it did make all the difference. It was wonderful to sit on the balcony before we headed to dinner and enjoy the view and the music from the bar area.The rooms were exceptionally clean, the staff very friendly and all attention to detail was noticed by our group.We tried all but one restaurant and were very impressed by them all. The Japanese restaurant was our last night and it was a lot of fun. The French restaurant was very good as well and the seafood and steak restaurants were enjoyed.We spent most of our days on the beach. We enjoyed the water and the sun as well as the beer and Bahama Mama's served to us by the very friendly and always there when you were even thinking about having a drink - Denny the Beach Concierge was great!We enjoyed the evening shows - especially the Circus show. It was awesome.We really enjoyed our stay at the Colonial and look forward to spending another vacation next year at the Majestic Elegance.

<Content>Not A 5 Star!! NOT A 5 STAR!!!I know the hotel is in the carribean and things are a little differant there ,but all these people that rave about how great this hotel is, have in my opinion never stayed in a 5 star hotel.GROUNDS.very pretty and plants and flowers kept watered pruned and looking great hats off to the guys in green who keep the place looking great these are the guys who deserve a tip, working all day outside in the heat.RESTAURANTS.French restaurant is the only one where the food is of decent quality and where you can almost believe you are in a 5 star resort.Make sure if you buy wine there and you pay in cash keep your reciept or you may later be accused of walking out without paying,( long story).Buffet restaurant good choice but most things are let go cold apart from things that are cooked infront of you , also some of the cooks use the same tongs for raw meat as cooked beware!!.The staff in this restaurant in my mind are the hardest working and most friendly.Steak Fish restaurants can be hit or miss steak ok but staff hurry you and all are not friendly and they are always looking for a tip.ACCOMODATION .Standard junior suite are not any way near 5 star standard while they are kept clean, bed sides are stained showers broken showing wear and tear ,ciggerette burns on bed cover also they smell very damp.Due to a problem we had which was down to the hotel, we were upgraded to a Majestic Colonial Suite with seperate sitting room double balcony and terrace with hot tub , now this was 5 star standard could not fault the room in anyway ,nothing like standard rooms .BEACH.wonderful clean white sand.SUMMERY.Hotel looks nice and is nice but if you want a 5 star resort with 5 star service you will not find it here unless you book one of its top suites then at least you will get a decent room.Devon U.k

<Content>Awesome holiday!! We went to the majestic colonial for my brother's wedding and it was gorgeous. I found the staff incredibly friendly and I would like to give a shout out to Rafael who worked in the buffet and mexican restaurant! He remembered my one and a half year olds name throughout the trip and was extremely friendly. All of the staff were for the most part friendly. The hotel was fully booked, that being said there was usually a spot at the beach to be had. We had to put towels out early to sit by the pool. The animation team by the pool were also very friendly and calling my sister and cousin by name by the end of the trip to come and do activities! The food was good with a lot of variety. I personally got a little sick of the menu and I think eating for two weeks there might have been too much! Most of us did get minor cases of diarrhea at one time or another so I would suggest some immodium. There was also misquito's, suprisingly, mostly early morning and at night! The wedding was gorgeous even though there were a few issues with the private dinner the bride and groom were supposed to get. It is actually just a dinner in one of the restaurants that they could go to anytime anyways. I was thinking it would be on the beach or more romantic. Their breakfast the morning after the wedding was extremely late 11:30am so that was also a little frustrating for them. They were happy with the photographer though! The photo hut is a little cash cow. I spent 60 US dollars myself just on pictures that the hotel photographer took of us bumming around the resort. I love that they will give you a private photo session if you want. they charge 10 dollars per picture if you want a burnt cd. not cheap, but worth it if you are on a honeymoon or want family pics done. there work was fantastic!Now for the drawbacks. The beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable! I had a room with two double beds and the rest of my party that had these rooms agreed that the beds were very hard. The rooms do not leave much to the imagination because you can literally hear everything that is going on in the toilet because it is not fully enclosed. The housekeeping was random and sometimes was not done until 5 or 6pm at night. For some reason the power kept going out so bring a watch to reset the clock in your room. some rooms didn't even have a clock. The pool was a little dirty for my liking with debris floating in it. It didn't seem like they gave it a very thorough cleaning every day. the kid's area was also lacking. Bring some toys if you have kids because the hotel provides no water toys for the kiddies. My son played mostly in the shallow pool by the pool bar. The stores in the hotel were a major rip off. It cost 12 dollars for deodorant! If you are looking for touristy stuff you can go and barter at the market that is just outside of the first set of gates (about a 10 minute walk) You will get way cheaper souvenirs. All said and done we had a fantastic trip and I would recommend this hotel. It is not quite a 5 star rating, but it could be with a little more work!

<Content>Never going back Okay, my husband and I went down there for a wedding. Just got back yesterday.Arrived at the resort only to find that half our groug (about 25 people) didn`t have rooms ready at 3:00 pm. Didn`t seem like a huge issue at first. We were told it would be about an hour and we all went to get a drink.Those included who did not have a room ready were the bride and groom, the brides parents, my husband and I and many others.Went back an hour later, luckily our room was ready however almost everyone elses was not. Found out that the resort had double booked many rooms and one couple from our group actually got moved to another resort. They did however get bands so they could come and go into Majestic Colonial.Bride and Groom didn`t get a room until around 9 and staff refused to give them towel cards so they could go swiming. Buffet was okay. Large selection, some food was cold when it should have been hot. Covers on food might have helped keep the heat in. Le Gourmet was the only meal we really enjoyed.Almost immediately half our group was sick. Violently throwing up, fevers, and chest problems. Mother of the groom was rushed to the hospital but returned next day. There is a clinic on site but its $90.00 to basically walk through the door and then if you need anything another arm and leg.Father of the Bride also became very ill staying in his room a great deal of the time.Bar was okay. Not a huge selection for liquor (premium) and if you wanted what they did have you had to pay. (bailey`s ect)When we went to Sandals Jamaica Ocho Rios all liquor was included. Even things like Covasia and Grand Marnier.If you ordered a slushy like drink, ie Pina Colada or Daquiri`s you had better as for alcohol otherwise you aren`t getting it. On the other side, my rum and coke had way more run then coke.Beach was really nice, water was worm. Clothing on the beach was optional so there were a lot of breasts and banana hammocks.Bride and Groom got sick on last day. Thankfully not the wedding and and when we got back home had to go to the doctors.Mother of the brides luggage did not make it to the airport even though the bus driver assured us it went on the bus. Dont know how they can assure us of that when it wasnt there. Had to pay themselves to have the luggage come by taxi and yes, they did get a receipt. I would be asking the hotel for the money.Overall we still had a good time as we were with our friends for a wedding but I would never go back there.

<Content>Good times at the Majestic Colonial We have just returned from a weeks stay at the Majestic Colonial. We were originally to stay at the Majestic Elegance but they were not open yet (they still were working hard when we left (Nov 21st) an I'm guessing 1-2 weeks of more work to be finished).The room was nice and clean and in good shape. We did change rooms because of the construction of the Elegance, and we thank Janet at the front desk for being so helpful and accommodating.The food was plentiful and of good quality, but be sure to book the French and Japaneses restaurants early as they book up fast. Both were very good.The beach was fantastic and we spent a lot of time there. There always seems to be a breeze coming off the ocean but this can be a welcome relief from the heat. We'd like to thank Denny the Beach Concierge for the excellent service. He made sure we were never without (water, cerveza, etc, etc) and we learned some important Spanish phrases from him as well. He made our time at the beach relaxing and fun. A nice thing we noticed is that you don't need to be up at 6am to claim your piece of the beach, there seemed to be enough chairs etc to go around (within reason).We wish we could remember all the names of the staff members that made our stay most enjoyable. They really went out of their way to make sure our holiday was memorable. Their quality of service was top notch and they always seemed to smile and have fun (something you don't see very often).The nightly entertainment was of better quality than expected and the Circus night was excellent. The dancers of the Majestic we really incredible and fun to watch.We are looking forward to returning and checking out the Majestic Elegance in the future.

<Content>Our trip in November 2008 WE stayed 10 days in this lovely hotel. I would like to give my appreciation and thanks to the following people who made our stay extra special: They are PEDRO at10BBY bar,he always wisle as a bird and my husband would wisle back to him at the bar every evening before dinner. Very special people at the buffet restorants are : Jose, Omar and Jacquilin who made effords to make our wishes true (example I like to drink cranberry juice with lunch and there I had crambbery juice with lunch)Regarding maintanance: The clock in our room needed 9 V battery which after 10 days and 10 calls was not available. This was very important as we booked San Domenico tour and needed to be in lobby at 6:10AM, I went to receptionist in person and asked to wake up call which never came!!!!! If we were not by pure chance at 6:10AM in lobby we would loose $190.00.There are 3 showers slall at the pool by the building 2 none of them working. I aked 4-5 different people to fix at least one because it would be easier for them to maintan the pool clean and not have so much sand in the pools because peple are not able to wash off before going to the pool. I bet showers are still not in operations. There are so many maintainace people which I think need closer supervision.,All people smile,not because they have to but from the heart!

<Content>Beautiful, clean and friendly resort From the moment you step into this resort the feeling is truly majestic. The two-story open air lobby is equisitely, yet comfortably furnished with a full-service bar. Perfect spot to relax while waiting for travel companions to join you.Main feature is the hotel length pool - absolutely wonderful! If you can, get a ground floor room facing the pool. You can exit your sliding glass doors and walk 20 steps to the pool and jump right in. Rooms are gorgeous but not big on privacy - modest travelers may consider putting a towel down on the floor of the shower while dressing (it's huge - it could stand 4 or 5 people).There are several restaurants which are all decent but our fav by far was the Mexican one. Japanese and French require reservations so book when you arrive.Beach is gorgeous!! Comfortable lounge chairs and plenty of palm trees and palm umbrellas if you need some shade. You can snorkel or boogie board for 1hr. per day per person per room so if you like to snorkel for extended periods, bring your own stuff. Reef is very close to shore. Windsurfing and Catamaran are also included.The staff couldn't have been friendlier!!! Everyone spoke enough english to assist your needs. We went down to breakfast buffet each morning and were always warmly welcomed by Marisal Savados Refinas. She was always so cheerful and happy to see us and exchanged light conversation. Made us feel very comfortable.Entertainment every night in their beautiful, huge, open air covered theater complete with wait staff bar service . Entertainmant not always appropriate for children or teens, however one night there was an acrobatic circus that was really great for everyone.Don't forget several cans or bottles of sunscreen because it is very expensive at the resort!!

<Content>A Paradise We were very impressed with the Majestic Colonial Resort, as the ownership appears to have spared no expense in providing a great 5 star resort. The staff are extraordinary in their genuine concern for you and your comfort. The staff, and Dominican people, are the nicest I've ever met and I'm reasonably well traveled. For example, the beach is beautiful and they could easily call the beach Denny's Beach because the beach consierge, Denny, is warm, personable, polite, and helpful in every way. The rooms are excellent, big, whirlpool, clean and comfortable. We had robes and slippers. The food was good, I think there are 8 restaurants and 9 bars. Staff appear to be happy to help and serve you and do not look for tips, although they are gladly accepted. The main restaurant has a daily breakfast which is amazing, as they have everything you can think of, omelet bars, etc. I'd go back tomorrow. tonysumigray@aol.com

<Content>Never got the chance to stay.... Just returned from our trip and had to report this.First off we had booked our trip at the new resort the Elegance with hopes that it would be opened as planned on the 14th. On Thursday we called our travel agent to see if it will be opened and we were told it won't be, however our reservation will be moved to the Colonial. We arrived at the Colonial only to be told sorry....no rooms here. We are now being moved to the Gran Bahia Pricipe, they said same 5 star category and all the same amenties. Also, for our trouble we will get a 3 nights stay at the Elegance valid for a year (subject to availablitly). Off we go in a taxi to the Principe. As I check in, we were shown to our room. There is no way this is a 5 star resort. This was in the Priemier section. It was old, dingy, the ceiling leaked in our bathroom. I will gladly will post pictures tomorrow. Just wanted to report this before anyone else falls victim to this.If I was told ahead of time, I would have been able to change my plans in coming. I work for the airlines, so that is not a problem to fly at a later date. Also, if you get stuck not being able to make reservations at the ala carte restaurants, you will be at the buffets. The food was horrible. Pizza was the only thing we liked. I will say the ala carte restaurants we were able to get into, were quite good. I know I will be bashed by some regarding my comments. My wife and I felt really bad for this young couple that arrived on Sunday. They were on their honeymoon! They were so disgusted by the room they got, they left to go back home. You make reservations, expect to get all the amenities that read about. Only you end up with quite the opposite. We were also told we could upgrade for $30/night to the Ambra, where you get 24hr room service, things that we have received at the Majestic. I should not have to pay anything more out of my pocket, the Majestic should have done that for us.I do understand that a delay can happen, I also do understand that one might need to be moved to another location. But, I do believe a resort should do everything possible to make your stay as nice as it would be if you were at your original resort where booked. Should not be way way less!Although I can't actually review the hotel, this is more of a review of the way they are treating those who were booked and moved. The Gran Bahia is rated # 34 out of 86, you would think the #1 resort Majestic would have moved us to at least first top ten.

<Content>didn't want to leave... My best friend and I were slated to stay at the new Majestic Elegance from November 8th to the 15th, but due to opening delays resided instead at the Majestic Colonial. I myself had never been to the Dominican Republic, where she had been numerous occasions to the different tourist areas throughout the country. I think we were both equally impressed with the resort and area alike. To me there could have been no better ambassador to the Dominican than the Majestic Colonial; every member of staff I met was extremely and genuinely friendly (not to mention incredibly hard working). I found this to be true elsewhere in the area as well (just in case you are thinking of excursions). Amazingly enough the great attitudes of the people working at the Majestic rubbed off on our fellows tourists; we made many new friends Dominican and American. The hotel itself is beautiful, perfectly echoing its natural surroundings. The grounds are impeccably landscaped and facilities are well-maintained. Rooms are spacious and very clean (love the big shower and Jacuzzi tub). Each room also has a balcony or sitting area which is nice for relaxing in the evening. The pool, though second to the beach in my opinion, is one of the hotels greatest assets. It is refreshing and large, spanning just about the entire length of the hotel. There is always a place to rest in the sun or under the palapas. Drinks are never far away whether walking to the bar or swimming. We tried all of the restaurants including the two a la carte, and always found something we like. Desserts were always fabulous; the local fruits were especially delicious (as is anything covered in chocolate!). The best place by far is the beach. I highly recommend snorkeling. There is a vast array of beautiful fish swimming around the coral reefs that dot the shoreline of the property. *While you are on the beach, say hello to the wonderful beach concierge Denny. He is very sweet, attentive, and will make you feel right at home. I miss him already!!!Do not hesitate to stay at this property. If you are easy going like myself, you will find nothing wrong. I think even the more discerning clientele would have to agree, the tiniest of problems are greatly overshadowed by the gracious people who are there to welcome you and assist you in your stay.

<Content>Majestic Colonial great place The only bad thing about this place was the coffee, (next time we bring our own) the food was good Majestic very clean we had a Junior Suite Standard which was to our surprise quite large. Shows were entertaining not much in shoppingThe sand on the beach very soft. This time of year you need to take care because oceans can be rough otherwise had lots of fun. Took a one day excursion to Samona Island Hoping to get back there next year

<Content>Majestic Coloniol - Fantastic! Our first stay in the Majestic was absolutaly phenomanol!It was mine and out partners first time with my parents. Well as we arrived at Punta cana, we were greeted by many happy staff at the airport. It took usa 35-40 minute drive to the Majestic.Here goes..CHECK-IN.As we arrived, we all recieved majestic cocktails, and a bell boy was happy to take our bags for us. We did request a pool view ground floor 2 rooms next too eachother , but we couldn't get it as none were avaliable, We ended up being on 3rd floor garden view over the next resort. Then a couple of days later we were given the option to pay a 30$ a night for a groundfloor swim-up. My parents took it so that wasn't a problem.ROOMSRooms are large, very clean, and very spacious with a jaccusi bath , a big shower, and a toilet, and two sinks!We had a king size poster bed! The beds weren't as comfortable as we were hoping for but thats it. There is a big tv which you can cover up and a mini-bar which is stocked daily. We also got little amneties such as shampoo,conditioner, shower gel daily.Our balcony had a table and two chairs.BARSWe were impressed with the bar serive esepcially the swim-up bar!There is a bar by the pool which there is a special mention we have to say to a member of staff ! VICTOR! thank you for the pictures, we will put them up soon. We hope you're kids enjoy the floats!YEAH BABYYY! and we will definantly be coming back next year!!RESTAURANTSThe staff were always really friendly in all restaurants, despite if u didn't give them a tip!The mexican restaurant me and my family thought were actually quite good there was a lot of menu choise compared to most restuarants but either way good food, shame about the lighting.The seafood was really good , we weren't there twice .. i asked a member of staff which maincourse i should go for .. Shrimps or Lobster.. he suggesed shrimps and they were gorgeous!The steakhouse we went to for my partners suprise birthday party, that was really good as there were petals on the table and they did a birthday cake for him, and sang aswell!Le gourment was quite bad the first time, as the service was bad and the manager kept walking around aimlesly.. When the starters came, the waitors came to top up our drinks, but we were waiting for our maincourse for so long , then no serivce , we noticed alot of other people waiting aswell. But the second time we went We had great service and the food was much better. The main buffetWe did go there for breakfast - great choice of food.. and lunch was really good aswell..the dinner when we went out on halloween night and it was really good as they did great decor and everyone was in the spirit of dressing up! Food there was pretty average but still a nice choice of food!Beach buffetI agree with most people saying that the beach buffet was pretty small but with very quick service ... a nice touch!JapaneseWe were actually quite dissapointed with this restaurant .. as on the menu they had a good selection but then didn't have some of the main courses we asked for ..They didnt bring out any noodles .. and when you were eating they ended up cleaning the surface which wasn't quite a nice sight. The chef wasn't really enthusiastic and didn't do any special tricks. We decided not to try that one again.ChineseThis was nothing special either, there wasn't alot of menu choise and the food was average.. The service was OK though.POOLThe pool was very long with a cut in the middle.There was two whirlpool spa areas .. there was never many screaming kids at all. And the chairs you would probably have to get them at the early start as if you didn't go until 11ish there wouldn't be much choice.BEACHThere was always chairs .. but at the time we were there , came about 4 wedding partys and the beach eneded up heaving so you did have to book the seats that little bit earlier. The palm tree's were a great touch aswell. The sea was magnificant, unfortunantly there was the odd occasion of hitting your feet on the rocks but for a coral reef you can hardley be suprised.The white sands were so nice and a nice walk in the morning before breakfast is well worth it.We didnt end up viewing the shows , as we were in the bars most of the time.The lobby was really good aswell as there was a small libary with computers. $5 for 30 mins on the internet wasn't bad. There was also a small cigar and jewlerry shop, but we didn't go in them as told we could get cheaper outside the resort but from good suplies.We are waiting till their sister resort which is ment to opening in a couple of weeks time!! Thank you for a wonderful stay!

<Content>Relaxing Holiday Thank you Majestic Colonial for a truly relaxing holiday, the resort was spotlessly clean, the staff were very friendly and the beach was the loveliest I have ever been to! The only downside for me were the drinks, which were all made up with syrups. Special thanks to Denny our beach concierge, Milagro the camorita and Francisco Morales at the beach restaurant. See you all again next year!

<Content>girlfriends When my girlfriend and I first arrived at this resort, it was two in the morning nov 8th, we had a long delay, but the staff was so nice when we showed up that we did not want to complain.We would both tell anyone that everything is awesome. Just remember the culture is different, and they try so hard to make you feel comfortable and welcomed. Remember that these people work from morning till night everyday. The rooms are beautiful, food great, really no complaints, go there and have a blast it is fabulous.We are Canada, and would recommend this to anyone,Thanks, Double trouble!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ontario

<Content>Second stay even better than the first..... We stayed at Majestic Colonial from November 1st until 8th, traveling with a 12 year old and another family with an 11 year old and 14 year old. We had previously stayed there last year at the end of November, and were not disappointed. This was our friends' first time traveling to a tropical resort with kids and Majestic did not disappoint!Last year we had found the staff, aside from the amination team, a little reserved. This year the staff throughout the resort were entirely friendly and went out of their way to meet our needs/requests. Special thanks to Jesus and Mosquito.Last year's stay was fantastic, this year's even more fantastic than last's, if that is at all possible. We enjoyed the food, the entertainment, the beach, the shows, the cleanliness of the resort and the staff's comedy and antics! There were a few glitch's the day we arrived with our room, but this could happen at any resort. As we have traveled many times before, and this was nothing that could not be fixed (i.e. we had requested a king sized bed and a cot in the room and ended up with a room with two double beds, our friend's had a problem with their air conditioning and this was fixed promto), it was not a big deal.As with traveling to any country, be prepared to expect stomach/bowel upset, as it is a tropical country and you are out of your element eating and drinking things that are not a normal part of your repertoire and you are in a tropical climate --- nothing that cannot be fixed with a couple of tablets of pepto and caution trying new things. All the water used throughout the resort is purified, you can check this out with your vacation representative.All in all, I would not hesitate to go back to the resort in a heartbeat, for a third time. The beach is out of this world, the resort clean beyond belief; whether it be your room, the grounds, the pool or the beach area. The restaurants provide a fantastic assortment --- just be sure if you are interested in the a la carts, to book upon arrival, so that you are not disappointed.Thanks for a fantastic vacation!

<Content>Majestically wonderful ! My husband and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial 11/8 -11/15. All we can say is that if anyone complains about anything at this resort, they are doing so just to complain! We were on the 3rd floor (pool side) and had somewhat of an oceanview. We did notice that the folks on the first floors did need to spray their rooms and put towels under the door to keep bugs out, but we had no problem whatsoever with bugs. The rooms are large, comfortable and clean. Staff are always friendly and smiling. The animation team is non stop from sun up to sun down. The food in all of the restaurants, including the buffet, was exceptionally good. Mexican restaurant, however, was mediocre. We did not have upset stomachs or diarrhea at all in the 8 days we were there. The beach was lovely. You do not have to get up in the early a.m. hours and mark a cabana with a towel as you can get a cabana and/or shade with chairs at any time during the day. There are plenty of chairs/cabanas for everyone. Same is true for the pool areas.We would go back to the Majestic again without hesitation.

<Content>Caution - When push comes to shove Although the hotel may be beautiful, my 82 year old mother in law broke her hip and thigh on the floors slippery from condensation, which also made her sheets wet constantly. We were threatened by hotel management that we had to sign a release, or the hotel would not pay for any help for us. Although Dominican surgeon said she could not fly sitting up, all the hotel did was book one seat on a commercial airliner, in which she had to fly sitting up. The doctor called from Puerto Rico to accompany her to NYC was not called for over 24 hours after promised, and the doctor was livid at what was done to her, for which he said hotel was accountable. Take plenty of extra insurance when you book, because this hotel will threaten you and leave you hanging if something should happen.

<Content>Denny: Beach concierge I just returned from my stay at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana, and I had a wonderful time! My favourite thing to do was go to the beach every morning and the beach concierge Denny was fabulous! He always greeted us with a smile, was quick with our drinks, and knew our names too. It was a pleasure to see Denny every day, and we will miss him! It's refreshing to see someone who enjoys their job and is so very good at it. Keep up the great work Denny!

<Content>Great Hotel This was our third time to Punta Cana at the Majestic Colonial. The hotel staff is excellent and the hotel is very clean. When we come back to Punta Cana we will stay here again. One addition to the services was a beach consierge. This is a wonderful feature if you like to be waited on and have someone bring you drinks. We had the pleasure of meeting Denny. He is terrific! He was very attentive to our needs, and very friendly. Denny is truly a great person and gives the guests teriffic service!

<Content>A great resort We just returned from an enjoyable stay at the Majestic Colonial which is located in the Bavaro beach/coastline area, about a 35 minute drive from the Punta Cana airport. We had flown in with our 18 month old son for our friends' wedding to be held later during the week.We arrived at the resort at approximately 8 pm and were immediately impressed with the beautiful lobby/reception area. The check-in process was straightforward and we were greeted by one of the staff handing out a tray of tropical drinks - a very nice way to start our vacation!The lobby/main reception area is enormous. On the reception area there is an internet/library room (air conditioned), a jewellery shop, a cigar shop, and a large seating area with many couches and coffee tables and a well stocked bar. Most evenings the resort has a pianist playing piano which makes for a nice relaxing environment. Adjacent to the internet room are 3 desks for concierge service where you can book golf tee times or dinner reservations/excursions outside of the resort.There are porters on hand to haul your luggage to your room - because we had our toddler with us, we had a lot of luggage and the porter still managed to cart all of it using a little dolly within the promised 15 minute time frame.Coming down the stairs from the main lobby is another bar/lounge area, surrounded by 3 restaurants (Taino - Caribbean fare, Le Gourmet - French cuisine, and Matsuri - Oriental offerings). The rooms are set up such that they buildings run perpendicular to the main building (front of the main building faces west, and the hotel room buildings run east west, with the east side closest to the beach/ocean). In between the two parallel building structures is the pool. A huge pool. More on that later.We booked a junior suite (separate master bedroom ensuite) and the living room area was separted from the master BR via wooden sliding doors. The room was huge and being on the 4th floor we had very high ceiings which added to the feeling of space. The living room area doubled as our son's bedroom at night, and because our master BR was so big and had its own TV and its own minibar (there is also one in the living room area) we never felt trapped at night. Another nice touch with the junior suite is that you get an extra large/long balcony, accessible from both the living room area and the bedroom area. Our room faced the interior of the resort so we had a good view of the pool. The rooms are air conditioned which made for a nice reprieve from being out in the sun every day.We loved the pool area. The pool basically runs the entire length of the hotel room building structures. Even being on the fourth floor we were a quick elevator ride and 60 second walk to the pool. Closer to the ocean side of the pool there is a swim-up bar. This area is usually where the games/festivities are held.This place is designed for weddings. There is a beautiful white gazebo which is used for weddings, although many others choose to get married on the beach (there is a gazebo set up on the beach as well - this is where our friends got married). The staff can quickly convert a bar/ lounge area into a nice wedding reception area complete with white/ ivory chair covers and dinner table settings.Overall we found the food to be good - the buffet is adequate and contained enough variety to satisfy our toddler. Although there was variety I wouldn't say that the food was top notch. especially compared to some all-inclusives I've been to in Cancun. The staff are very attentive and friendly, always quick to refresh your drink and take away finished plates and replace cutlery.The steakhouse in the palapa hut by the ocean is very good. You don't need reservations, unlike other a la carte restaurants at other all-inclusives, so we were able to visit some of the a la carte restaurants more than once. The chateaubriand was good - although the portions could have been larger (I'm sure I could just ordered extra). Sirloin steak was also very good and accurately cooked - portion size was spot on.We didn't visit Le Gourmet (reservations required, children are not permitted in the restaurant) but our friends indicated that they enjoyed the food.Matsuri served oriental food. Reservations are required if you want the Teppan-Yaki food demonstration experience (basically the chefs cook the food in front of you) but no reservations are required is you eat in the general restaurant area. Sushi is mediocre - we showed up just when the restaurant opened and it appeared that the sushi had been sitting there for a couple hours. The fish and shrimp used in the nigiri-sushi seemed to be dried up and shriveled. We ordered a lemon chicken dish - the lemon sauce was a bit too overpowering and a pork chow mein dish which seemed to have a whole bottle of soy sauce thrown into the dish! Overall we weren't impressed with the food at Matsuri.The beach area is fantastic. Beautiful sand, warm ocean, and there always seemed to be a nice breeze blowing through which helped to take the edge off of the humidity.Hotel staff, the bueffet staff (Yissel, and all the guys and gals at Buffet Supreme - thank you for your hospitality and for putting up with our energetic little boy!), chambermaids and pool and beach staff were all very friendly and courteous. This is one of the reasons why we enjoyed the resort so much.There is an onsite spa - we both booked massages and had different experiences even though we both used the same massage therapist (Claudia). Mine was in the morning and the massage was good. Claudia must have been tired by the time the afternoon rolled around because she actually fell ASLEEP while she was giving my wife a massage. What the???? Spa staff overall were friendly.For those with toddlers/babies - it's hit and miss as to whether or not your room will be equipped with a playpen/crib. We chose to bring one with us and it turned out to be a good decision because there wasn't one in our suite when we arrived. A small hassle to bring it with us, but proved handy in the end.The resort has babysitting service ($15 USD per hour) which is great for couples bringing their kids. Allows you to get away and have a quiet dinner or two! Thanks to Leonella for babysitting.Overall - an above average experience due to the friendliness of the staff, the resort layout, the amazing pool area and the beach area. Don't expect a lot from the food - it is average at best.

<Content>The best all inclusive I have ever been to!! The majestic is by far the best all inclusive resort that I have ever been to. The food was wonderful with a lot of options throughout the day. The staff was so pleasant. I don't think that I ever passed a member of the staff from managers to maintence workers withoug getting a huge smile and a very warm HOLA!! The grounds, pool and rooms and immaculate. Our room was right in front of an elevator which is normally a very loud place to be, but we were never disturbed by any noise. My only suggestion is that if you want to experience both the gourmet and japanese resturants, make your dinner reservations while you are checking in. We were able to get into the le gourmet, and our dinner was wonderful, but we were not able to secure a reservation at the japanese resturant.

<Content>Tom - Marlton NJ This was our first time in DR and I have to say we picked the perfic place to stay, everything about the Majestic Colonial was perfect from the wait staff in all of the restaurants to the bartenders and maids ...... I could not find a negative thing to say even if I tried. We will be booking our trip for next year to go back to the Majestic. We traveled with another family and two 13 year olds who I think had a better time than we did ....... If you would like to book a excursion while you are there go see Ronald he was the biggest help when we were deciding which trip to take....by the way we did the dune buggy trip and it was a couple hour trip but a lot of fun. Can't say enough about this place ....what more could you ask for, good freinds, good food, good drink and a perfic resort.

<Content>cannot fault in any way We were a group of 11 people with ages ranging from 52 to 4 years old who stayed at the Majestic colonial from 23 October to 03 November.We had 11 wonderful nights in what can only be described as absoloute heaven.The key to success at this hotel is the staff, I have never been anywhere in the world and felt so humble and incredibly lucky to have met so many genuine people. All the staff work incredibly hard to ensure you have a wonderful holiday.The grounds are amazing, The Restaurants excellent, The Beach and Pool totally first class. The rooms are beautiful, although as a brit we did find the bathroom situation very bizarre and a bit embarrasing (the bathrooms are of an openplan design, which does not give much privacy).We are amazed about the reports of so called food poisining, as mentioned earlier we were a party of 11 there for 11 nights and I can honestly say that no one suffered with any aspect of upset tummy. We were all sensible and ate a balanced diet includingshell fish, we limited our intake of salad and fresh fruit and were careful over the amount of fruit cocktails we drank. Many of the cocktails are made with fruit syrup and this is a natural laxative.We also ate every day at the beach front restaurant for lunch as it suited us not to dry off completley. We did not notice food being recycled, the only thing we watched here, was one of the Chef's could undercook the burgers or chicken, but a polite word and he would cook it exactly to your liking.The hotel went out of their way to celebrate Halloween, with a party which seemed to go on all day, culminating in an amazing dining experience at the main buffet restaurant, I hope to be able to post a picture of the Chef coming out of the Soup dome.We felt the animation team totally made our holiday, they were all individually talented and worked extremeley hard to cater for all ages, tastes, likes and dislikes. We enjoyed all the poolside games and evening shows and thought the visiting evening acts were very entertaining.Being Catholic, I loved the little Catholic Chapel and was delighted to discover a priest visits every week to say mass at 600pm. The service is in spanish, but is very beautiful.Our rep services were VIP and the rep Geema was excellent and gave great advice on trips, we only went on one and that was to swim with sharks and stingray - we found this to be excellent value for money.We loved our stay at the Majestic and really hope we can afford to return next year - all depends on the credit crunch.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel and Island My Fiance and I stayed at the Majestic from 29th Sept - 14th Oct. When we got to the hotel we were very impressed, the lobby is beautiful, the reception staff and porters are very good and you get a Majestic cocktail (non-alcoholic) on arrival.The hotel has a very grand staircase that leads down to the resort. The resort itself is very beautful. The gardens are extremely well kept with a huge variety of plants. The are water fountains around the lobby which look good in the sun. The pool is the most amazing pool I've ever seen. It goes all the way down from the top of the resort to the beach front and has jacuzzis at each end and a pool bar in the middle. The only thing I'd say about the pool is you can't lay in the sun quietly very easily. At around lunch time they put the speakers on at the bar in the middle and turn it up really loud so you can't really get away from it. The annoying thing about this is they only have about 3 CD's they play during the day so the songs get very old very quickly. Unfortunatelty they also do this on the beach so this was one of my bad points about the resort.The beach is very well kept. The sand is so soft and the water is clear. There is a roped off area to swim in as there are boats and it gets quite deep quite quickly. They often have a BBQ on the beach at lunch which serves burgers, ribs, salad  potatoes.The rooms are very spacious clean and well equiped. The balconies are big and the bed is huge. Remember to tip the mini bar man.We found the restaurants to be just OK. The buffet restaurant in our opinion is the best place to eat. The steak house over cooks everything and rushes you, Taino was barely open but the one time we went the fajitas were poor, Matsuri was OK but completely over the top. I thought the food was good here. Le Gourmet we didn't eat at. There are lots of bars to chose from and the best barman is Pedro (Noooo). We had a really good laugh with him and he made us some really good cocktails. We wish we could've brought him home with us.In summary we did have good holiday here and would recommend it to couples  families

<Content>Sub-4 Star We stayed at the Majestic Colonial for 3 nights/4 days with a large group. The trip was fabulous but I attribute most of the positives to the group that I was with and to the staff of the resort. Below is my attempt to write a neutral and comprehensive review of Majestic Colonial because I rely heavily on these reviews when I travel.Staff* The team in place throughout this resort is very professional* English is clearly not their first language, but each of the servers and staff was able to successfully and positively communicate despite the potential language barriers* Check out Victor by the pool bar---the other reviews are spot on when they praise him* It helps to tip (the drive from the airport to the resort shows how poor it is in the immediate area)Facilities* In general, the facilities throughout the resort are clean and nice* The beach is absolutely gorgeous and I'd return to Punta Cana anytime for the lovely beaches* We were surprised that this resort is only several years old because the building structures, outdoor furniture, and pool area seem older and dated* The large pool is great, especially if the resort is ever at full capacity* The situation with the towels annoyed me after a while (even though you had a bracelet and key, you still have to show the towel card)* The disco was entertaining, but the casino is pretty pathetic (and very smoky)* The walkways were always cleanFood* The food was horrible (there's just no other way to describe it)* Typically, the breakfast options at these all-inclusives are good and, in general, fulfill the purpose---not here! The breakfast/brunch was not very impressive and I worried about the overall cleanliness at the buffet* Still worse were the restaurant options; it didn't matter where you ate, everything had the same taste and no appeal* The only positive that I have relating to the food was our experience at the Japanese restaurant (we made reservations for the hibachi); the food was okay here but it was the chefs that made this one of our favorite dinners---thank you, Marcelino and Davio! I highly recommend you all make the reservations and eat here.Rooms* The room grew more dissatisfactory as the trip went on* Our bed wasn't made when we first arrived, which wasn't a big deal because we wanted to head to the pool right away. BUT, by nighttime, it still wasn't made and the comforter was stained (gross!)* The rooms never really felt really clean and again, you realized quickly where the resort skimped (mold near the sinks, clogged sink, broken jacuzzi, etc.)Overall Resort* While we had a nice time on this trip, I cannot honestly say that I'd return to the Majestic Colonial* When deciding to write a review, I hoped to project an accurate and thsu meaningful contribution. In that regard, I would say that my experience is relative to other true 4-5 star all-inclusives that I've visited (Riu Palace and Dreams Resorts). Compared to these other franchises, Majestic Colonial disappoints and falls in the sub-4 star category.

<Content>Great AI but advise from a very sick guest I agree with most of the reviews about the hotel but here is some advise I wish that someone had posted when I had read the reviews. HOW TO AVOID BECOMING ILL. If I can prevent you from getting ill, as we did, then at least all will not be lost. We travelled Oct. 22-30, 2008.I guess that we (4 of us) should have become worried when the bus announcer told us about 20+ times not to brush our teeth with the tap water. OK, I got that and did not. He assured us that all produce etc. was washed in purified water and water at eating areas was also purified. Take your chances on that. On our second day, despite all precations, my friends and I all became became violently ill. In fact, we all passed out either onto the hard marble floors or onto the cement around the pool hiting our heads and receiving large bumps.Major amounts of Gravol to get home and we were sick for at least 5 days after returning. So our 7 day vacation turned into at least a 2 day vacation and 5 days of sickness, plus 3 days work loss.Doing research upon returning home, we found out the following:Do not eat eat any produce or vegetables that do/did not have a peel.Do not eat anything from the sea.Do not drink any water, except bottled water, even at buffets.Only choose dishes that are bubbling hot or cooked in front of you.Majestic has a cooked vegetarian section, try it.Do not eat at the Beach Buffet where food is more often recycledThis is a 5* hotel that is only 2 years old....many people we talked to, since we looked so ill, also told us that they felt ill too. Shame on this hotel for not providing the purified water for all patrons. A purification system would be inexpensive in the long run as we won't be back to the DR despite the fact that the Majestic is otherwise a very nice place to vacation.Hope this helps. Sounds limiting but you take your chances. I took gravol, imodium etc. and nothing worked. We are all social drinkers and not heavy sunbathers, so we know it was the food/water. Be careful of young and elderly, please, because we were very, very ill.

<Content>Our first trip to DR, Punta Cana My honey and i stayed at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana during Oct 22- Oct 31st .Over All our stay was great, relaxing and wonderful, but i wouldn't call majestic the best hotel. To be fair i would say it's average, comparing hotel grounds (buildings, fountains, bathrooms) i would say it's like a 3 star. I just traveled to Playa del Carmen in May and stayed at Riu Palace, and have been to other places as well, so i have enough experiences to compare too.Food: The breakfast was ok, not much choices (bacon -yes, smoked salmon-no, bad salad dressings). Although the pastries were amazying: eggs, cereals, and juices were good, everything else was bad. My honey got sick the first day and i bet it's from the suprime food. At times it seemed like bad cafeteria food, smells, and looks of it. But Bread and Butter, wow!!! We mostly ate our lunch in the place at the beach, and dinner was great at Japanese, La Gourmet, two places on the beach(sea food and steak). It's sad but they don't really have great meat sauce nor salad dressings. And during lunch they don't really know how to cook meats...I wouldn't recommend eating at the Taino (mexican) nor Suprime, that's the place where they serve breakfast. Room: nice layout, twice a day change of towels and stock of the fridge. We got a free upgrade and stayed in the 2131 room, second building with the pool access, i would definately recommend pool vs the ocean view. The TV had enough variety, mostly watched NTV america (russian shows).Ocean and Pool: the waves are crazy big, but i still managed to go into the water since it was beautiful( not the best swimmer), also spent lots of time at the pool. If you have kids or even for adults bring floating mattress, ball and water toys, those things are very expensive once again. We bough a mattress for 12 $ and left it at the hotel for some kids. TIPS and TRICKS: take bug repelant- to prevent moscitos from bitting you, itch control cream or oitment, lots of sunblock (they sell it in the store for 36$), tylenol, any thing for stomach. Actually the prices in the hotel stores are very expensive. I had a rush i don't know why, itchy and crazy ... so be prepared. I think it's due to ocean water. Water sports, banana boats and all, be free to talk to those people and negotiate the price and time you want them to provide services for, other wise you'll get short time on anything. Go to their Photo store, make an appoitment and take lots of pictures with their professional photographers, Santi was amazying, we made an appoitment and he spent like over an hour with us, the pictures are just the BEST!!!. Please tip those people as well. Also, as i found out two days before leaving, there is room service ( towel change and that) in the evening and someone else than morning person does it, so leave a tip for that person as well. Take dollar bills with you, and even a dollar makes people happy. Stuff and service was good, have nothing to complain about.Bring comfy shoes, flip flops and anything you need, just bring, or will need to pay some high price for... cheap stuff...My honey is a coffee drinker and he didn't like their coffee, so bring your own, just in case.Before going to the airport, which wasn't as bad as people mentioned, EAT and even take some snacks with you, bring ziplock bags or wrap with you and take the food to the airport. The road to the airport wasn't bad at all, yes the country is very poor, but i guess most people don't know what bad roads are :))) come on everyone be thankful and.... enjoy.We went to use spa and had massage, that was very nice, i had aromatherapy and the woman was great.Entertainment: the hotel shows : magic show, circus, dancers performars were unprofessional. The beach party was boring, nothing special. The animation team was good, and shows with audience were great, funny, so good and i would rather watch that than have so called professionals to come over. WEATHER; was so warm, hot at times, it rained like 4 times during our 10 nights for about 10 minutes. The stay was great, but i wouldn't go to DR again, it seems that the hotels are not as good as in mexico. But no regrets, enjoyed, relaxed and had fun. Take lots of pictures, walk around to other resorts, be happy!!!

<Content>Great vacation and very nice staff My all family just returned from the Majestic and all I could tell you is that this was a terrific trip. I have been to many other hotels in the DR but I must confess that the quality of the service in this one was just perfect. Janet Vega, Dilcia, Donald, Francisco, Rosinda and Penelope were really classy. It is very rare to meet such nice people and so professional as well. Just beacuse of them I would return tomorrow. I strongly recommend this hotel--the beach is nice and the rooms truly amazing. Even after a week there it was so so diffcult to go back home to Canada especially knowing that winter was coming:-( The only thing I believe they need to improve is the quality of the evening shows. I found the quality average and there could use a bit more creativity. Beside that as I said before this hotel is close to paradise. Again big thanks to Janet, Dilcia, Donald, Francisco and Rosinda. God bless you all.

<Content>Terrific Vacation! What a wonderful, wonderful resort! My husband and I spent 7 terrific days at the Magestic. This was one of the best vacations we've ever gone on. The resort has everything you could ever wish for - a beautiful and clean beach with lots of lounge chairs, several nice clean pools, lots of entertainment options during the day and at night, good food options. Bring some cash to give out as tips and brush up on your Spanish (don't worry almost everyone speaks English, it's just not their native tongue). You will love this place! We are going back next year!

<Content>Superior facility with EXCELLENT service!!!! The Majestic Colonial is an outstanding facility. I spent an entire week within the confines of the property and I was never bored.The beach, the rooms, the restaurants, the well manicured grounds and the service providers left nothing to be desired. Although all of the service providers must be commended for being friendly, competent and attentive, if I had only one gold star to give I would have to give the star to Denny, the Beach Bar attendant. He was tireless in his efforts to keep all of the beach goes well hydrated and satisfied.If all goes well I would like to spend another week at the Majestic Colonial nest October.

<Content>great honeymoon! From the moment we arrived at the resort, to our last day, what stuck out the most was the service we received at Majestic Colonial. Upon arrival we were greeted with the famous Majestic drink and were helped to our rooms. We enjoyed interacting with the staff at Majestic, particularly the Animation Team that ran the afternoon activities. A few people I would like acknowledge was a man named Denny, who brought us drinks right on the beach and was so friendly and willing to give us whatever we needed. He was wonderful to visit with, and was very good at his job. Another person that made our honeymoon special was the hostess at the main buffet hall every morning. She was also the hostess at the Le Gourmet restaurant we frequented. She remembered us each morning, the languages we spoke, and was so warm and friendly. The beach was amazing, the food was great, the resort itself was spectacular...we never left.I would recommend this resort to anyone looking to get away to the Caribbean for a holiday.

<Content>Loved the Majestic As a travel agent myself, I won this trip to the Majestic Colonial. It was one of the best vacations I have been on. First of all the hotel itself is spotless and beautiful. As for the staff, the nicest people I have ever met that worked in a hotel - from the moment we arrived all of them couldn't be friendlier. The Animation Team was amazing. They were always on the go - playing games by the pool or the beach to putting on a nightly show (which all of the shows were fantastic) to dancing at the Disco. They always made you feel special. The two members of the team that stand out for me were John (Aerobics instructor) - very energetic and a pleasure to be around. The other is my favorite - Jesus (Supervisor of the Animation Team) - he sat and talked to you whether at the pool or the disco. He has an excellent personality and a lot of fun to be around. The entire staff was wonderful. I would recommend this hotel in a minute (as I have already done since I have returned 2 days ago). I will personally be returning to this hotel (with a bunch of my friends) to show them what a good time I had.Also, I introduced myself to Linda who works in Reservations. I had been emailing her because I had to change my original reservation to a later date. She could not have been more accommodating and a pleasure to work with. I look forward to speaking with her for my future trip.On a scale from 1-10, I would give the Majestic Colonial and Staff a 12.See you soon,Fila

<Content>Love to go back for my next vacation I like the entire resort overall. Also, the employees are excellent and make everything more fun. They encourage you/visitor to participate in games. There are specific employees called Mosquito, Jesus, Pablo, Diyer, Leo and Melvin they are a cool group. My wife and I had a great time and planning in going back next year and this time with our entire family. The wether was great and the beach water clear and warm.

The rooms were very clean and the atmosphere was wonderful. Most of all we enjoyed the animation team Jesus, Leo, Melvin Ive and Elsa. But most of all Moskito who kept us laughing all week. From the time we arrived the staff was helpful and friendly. The pool bar was great and you never had to wait to be served, Odani would have your drink ready as soon as he saw you swimming up. We had a wonderful time and look forward to returning there next year. Thank you to all of the staff for making our time memorable.

<Content>Mamma Wanna Go Back Where to start...overall, our stay at the Majestic from October 2nd - 12th was truly outstanding. Everything from the service, the amenities, the room, and the bottomless drinks were out of this world. Special mentions need to be given out to our bartender friends, Victor YEAH BABY!, Wandy (and his Especial drinks), Marcos, ODanny (Eye-yi-yi), and of course, Anjelly, and Flower. Last but not least, Janet at the front desk. Also, a special thank you to Pretty Boy, we know who you are. Mammawanna's are the real deal, not an urban legend. Give it a try!!This resort is definitely one of the most beautiful resorts my husband and I have ever been to. Considering that we were visiting a very impoverished part of the world, we were amazed by the beautiful surroundings of the resort and fantastic personalities of the Dominican people- they are very special and appreciative. Our room was always well-stocked and clean and we were never in need of anything. The staff goes above and beyond the call of duty to be sure that your stay is unique and extraordinary. There are plenty of choices for meals, better than what we expected. We highly recommend the steakhouse- excellent. Also, the experience at the Japanese steakhouse (Matsuri) was memorable and alot of fun. Give it a try!Also, a must do..get in the pool. It's absolutely gorgeous and so much fun!!!!! One warning, beware of the warm spots located near the pool bar and watch out for couples parked under the bridges...hubba hubba! Tips for those going to the Dominican...bring lots of US $1 (for tips), insect repellent (mosquitos are abundant- part of being in the tropics), bring ibuprofen (as a result of bottomless HALA HALA's), and last but not least, DON'T LEAVE YOUR BEACH TOWEL UNATTENDED- they are your responsibility. Be on the lookout for, Matahari  the Mute, Cheeseball, Joe Elliott, IT baby, Mrs. Brown the Gym Teacher, Captain Underpants, The English Whuur, The Boston Burrito, Sharpie  WhiteOut, The Odd Couple, The Diseases from NJ, The Queen of Mean  the Queen of Spades, Old Sweety Pies, Frenchy The Buffont, The Luftian  His Wife, Stray Cat Guy, May  December, Billy Rae Wanna Be Fat [--], and Sephora Woman.In all, we had the best honeymoon ever, and would definitely recommend this resort to anyone looking to create memories that will last a lifetime.

<Content>Loved the Majestic This is a great hotel. Here is a brief summary:Beach: Beautiful - There were always seats available in the shade, and we often got an outdoor bed, which was great for our young children (7 months and a year and a half). The waves and depth meant we could not go in too deep with the kids, but otherwise it was beautiful.Food: We could always find something fantastic to eat, but not everything was great. The fries, churos and donuts were delicious and fresh. The steakhouse had great steak. Make the effort to go to the tepenyaki restaurant and watch your meal being made in front of you. It was fun and tasty. Don't bother with the sit-down menu part of the Japanese restaurant. I really didn't like the food there - I ended up not touching my meal and going to the buffet instead. Otherwise, great options at the buffet - there were even healthy options.Rooms: Clean and comfortable. Mini bar was restocked daily.Pool: AMAZING! Best pool I have ever seen. Even though there were lots of people, we could always find a quiet spot in the pool where it felt like we were alone. I'd go back for the pool :)All in all, it was a fantastic family vacation. Staff was more than kind and helpful. Gave us milk for the older child readily (he drinks A LOT of milk) and were always there to get us coffee (Mmmm), water, pop - anything we needed.We will go back to the Majestic.

<Content>Honeymooned and loved it! We stayed here for our honeymoon in July/August 2007 and we had a wonderful time...We were looking for a really relaxing atmosphere where we could sit by the beach and read and swim all day... We weren't too interested in the night life... We had a fantastic time and really enjoyed all of the facilities... We spent most of our time at the beach, but also played tennis and ping pong and swam in the pools... We were surprised at the quality of the food... we were kind of expecting mediocre food but we thought everything was quite good...

<Content>Destination Wedding at Majestic Colonial was great Must husband and I just returned from having our daughter's destination wedding at Majestic Colonial Punta Cana in Dominican Republic.Our experience was wonderful, only we wished we had booked a few more days than the 5 days we did book, just to have more time to ourselves after the guests left. Besides my husband and myself and the bride and groom, there were 20 guests that attended. The hotel and grounds are very beautiful with every ammenity you could imagine. Service was wonderful and the staff was cordial, polite and helpful, and most spoke English. The few that did not speak English, such as the housekeepers, we had no trouble communicating with using sign and body language--not a big deal. Bring a Spanish-English dictionary with you if you think you could use one.The day of the wedding, 6 of us women utilized the spa for makeup, hair and nails, and all of us were very happy with how we looked when we were done. If you bring a picture of how you want your hair done, they will be happy to comply, or they have their own pictures there as well.We had the rehearsal dinner in the Taino restaurant and it was great and the food was wonderful, as was the service. This was done by reservation of course, so the staff could plan for us.The wedding itself went off without a hitch and the wedding coordinator and planner did a wonderful job taking care of things. The wedding was under the gazebo and it was romantic and beautifully decorated. Originally, the bride wanted the ceremony on the beach, but the coordinator advised us the day of, that the weather forecast was for 90% chance of rain and advised that we have it under the gazebo on the property, instead. I was impressed that they were looking out for us regarding that detail, as we were so busy with other things that we weren't watching the weather forecast. I think the gazebo was a better choice, personally, anyway. The ceremony took place at 5:00 pm, which was a cooler time of the day and very comfortable at that time of the year.The reception following the ceremony was in the Parrot Bar by the pool in the evening and the table settings and decorations and food was fantastic. We did personalize by adding some of our own touches, such as our own colored tapered candles and candlesticks and table runners that we wanted to use. We brought those over with us on the airplane, and provided them instructions on how we wanted them to place them on the tables. We had a full moon that night, and we arranged for a DJ and everything was wonderful. Again, the food was fantastic and exquisitely presented and decorated.I felt that it was less stress for all involved to do a wedding this way, with the added benefit of being able to take a vacation at the same time and actually spend some quality time with family and guests for such a special occasion.I highly recommend the Majestic Colonial for a destination wedding or for just a vacation. I would love to return again. There are 7 restaurants, 5 a la Carte, 1 buffet, and 1 fast food. Nine bars, nightime and daytime animation programs, and more. Just a fun place and they have a really neat pool. A word of advice for novice travelers. Be aware that the water is not potable on the island, but the hotel provides free bottled water and restocks the minibar in the rooms with it daily. Must use bottled water to brush teeth, so don't drink or rinse your mouth with tap water. The water and ice served in the Majestic hotel restaurants and bars is safe, however, as they use a purifed water source for food and drink preparation. In addition, contact your local health department for any needed immunizations prior to traveling, as should be the case when you travel anywhere out of the US. Only eat cooked vegetables and well cooked meat, and fruits without the peeling. If you follow these rules, you should be just fine and as always, don't overdo the alchohol. No one in our group became sick, by following these rules.Our trip was all inclusive, and although no tipping was required, we brought plenty of one dollar bills to tip anyway, as 47% of the island lives below the poverty level, and they do such a fine job,. We were more than glad to tip them a dollar or so here and there for their services. Also, we found that a tip left for housekeeping each day and a note or personal request for something, insured that we got looked after over and beyond. I also brought basic school supplies (pencils, paper, crayons, coloring books, stickers, etc.) for the staff's children as they are hard to come by there, which they were so grateful for. The Dominican people are a happy, pleasant people, and I enjoyed getting to know them.

<Content>Our Honey Moon at the Majestic Colonial Dear Fellow Travelers,Just wanted to let you know how are vacation went at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. We had noted that it was our honeymoon right on the hotel voucher but you know what, nothing special or extra was done at all for us. We had talked to 3 other honeymoon couples from Ontario and they all told us that they had swans made out of towels, rose pedals in a hot bathtub and special romantic dinners. We on the other hand got nothing, we were disappointed on that aspect of it being our special vacation/honeymoon. It was mentioned right on the voucher as well but I guess that their staff didn't notice that ahead of time! I had left tips almost every day of $5 US a day, now down here that's alot, our other honeymooner couple told us that they were leaving $1 US a day and they were the ones getting the swans and rose pedals I don't get it we were not impressed at all! The place is very nice and pretty clean it is a lot different in person than in the pictures. The room cleaning was bad they didn't really clean but picked up the room I had to ask 4 times for basic items such as a bathmat and face clothes, I shouldn't ever have to ask for these items in a so called 5 star hotel. They gave us 1 coffee for the room and when it was finished they never replaced it, again we had to chase the maid down hall and get one from her. Very unprofessional and it seemed like the maid didn't really care about her job and yet we were leaving $5 a day tips for her. After days of service like this I stopped the tips pretty fast! Mosquito's were another problem the first day or two I must have killed 60 of them in our room alone. Finally I went down to the lobby and asked if they could do something about it I was told that they could spray the room and it would help. It did help somewhat and cut down on the mosquito's considerably. To come to a conclusion the small things were just not there at all, and that's what counts for us! They really need to have their employees learn some English as well, most of the employees we spoke to, spoke nothing but Spanish and smiled. The most beautiful part of our trip was the excursion to Sanoma Island it was breathtaking and fun! So in the end we were not that impressed with their resort, and would never go back there, we had much better service and professionalism at the Riu in Playa Del Carmin, Mexico in February! Thanks, Gary and Susan

<Content>Very Nice DR Resort Okay so I will give my review with the hopes of putting people who were in my position minds鈥?at ease. The Majestic is great resort with some minor flaws.First off the really really bad that I am not holding against the Majestic. I fell into the Sept 30 no AC problem as well; this was on top of a regularly scheduled power outage at night. I don't think there is much they can do about the annual AC maintenance, which I understand, but don't schedule power maintenance for the same night. Our room got so hot; I needed to take my one year old son for a walk at 3 am. I am going to caulk this up to a once a year thing that people should avoid, and now on to my review.As I said the majestic is a great DR AI full stop, period.The rooms are out of this world (thanks AnnaM for hooking us up with a great room). We had the lowest level room and it was still great. I highly recommend room 3334, as it has a great view of the beach and pool.The grounds are beautiful.The pool is out of this world.The beach is great.The staff are fantastic, not one walked by without saying hola, and there was nothing we asked for that we didn't get. The food overall is fine. No one in my group got sick. The steakhouse is a must. I wont go into too many more details other then to say, if you are on the fence or if you have already booked, DON鈥橳 WORRY, this is a great place to spend sometime and is just as good as any other 4-5 Start in DR if not better.Cheers!CSF

<Content>Had a great time! We visited the Majestic 22/09/08 - 6/10/08 to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. We arrived in the middle of a tropical storm and were unable to land at Punta Cana Airport, we did land at Larimer to refuel and waited 90mins on the runway until we were able to take off and land at Punta Cana, meaning that our overall journey was 12 hours. That is were our problem ended!We arrived at the Majestic and were given Majestic cocktails, the bell boy took us up to our room (3338) pointing out the restaurants and bars on the way. The room was very nice, clean and spacious, overlooking the pool with a sea view also. The beach and pool were great with lots of space. The buffet had lots of choice, the staff (chefs, waiters and waitresses) were excellent we did not have to wait for anything. Steak and fish restaurants were very good, Japanese was excellent, the Mexican restaurant was very busy the night we attended and was just ok. The bars.. Pool bars was very good with singing bar man William, lobby bar fantastic, excellent bar tenders (Massimo, little Alex and the beautiful Angela) drinks were always refilled without even asking. The animation team were very entertaining, the circus show and Michael Jackson show were very good. We attended the little church on site to receive mass in Spanish, a lovely experience.Overall would say the employees of the Majestic make the hotel what it is.. fantastic!!! It was a wonderful experience to meet them all from the gardeners, pool staff, towel hut, cleaners (Lourdes - Lobby cleaner) and all who left the site spotless. Restaurant staff were so pleasant and helpful, did not have to wait for anything. Bar staff were fantastic! I can say all employees went above and beyond the call of service. Did not get to meet Anne Marie but look forward to doing so on our return visit next year.Also met lots of nice people from around the world, Americans, Canadians, Spanish, Dutch, Irish and of course English. Would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Punta Cana.Marie and Terry

<Content>Fantastic Holiday Just Returned from the Dom Rep for the first time, and have to say it was my best holiday to date.Booked the Majestic on the back of the reviews on Trip Advisor, so it only felt right to put my thoughts on the site. I agree in the main with most of the other positive posts on the site. I will breakdown my review into what I personally feel are important.Rooms - Great spacious room, clean and well looked after. Air con and fan worked well and I slept well on every night I was there, (very rare for me). The maid service was good and the room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels provided. Plenty of hot water and mini bar alway fully stocked.Food - You must go to the Matsuri Resturant, it was fantstic, the food and the show of the chef, we were in there for over 2 hours, and it absolutely flew by, it was great. When going to any of the buffets get the food freshly cooked. I had freshly cooked eggs, pasta and crepes and they were all fantastic. Breakfast was definately the best meal of the day. Some of the food that is pre cooked and left under hot plates was not as hot as I would have liked. The other a la carte restaurants were a little disappointing. The La gormet was the worst, very disapponited!! In the others whilst the food was nice, I can safely say I never said wow that was great (as I did in the Matsuri). The menu was limited, don't try to compare with restaurants at home. The food side of things is the only reason why this is not a 5 star review.Pool - The best I have ever been in. Can't say any more than that.Beach - Fantastic white sands and warm sea, never seen anything like it before. Get the snorkels from the watersport centre, there are tons of fish even in the shallows. I put my mask on and saw an angel fish immmediately!!! Also go on the tubes, only a few dollars but real fun.Staff - Really friendly and very helpful, you will never have an empty glass of water at dinner!!! Cannot fault the staff in anyway, they definately appreciate people trying to speak Spanish, and will teach you as well.Communial Areas - Absolutely beautiful, a real sense of quality. There were always staff tending to the gardens making sure the resort was looking top notch.Overall - Brilliant country, brilliant people, brilliant resort, only let down was the food.

<Content>Beautiful! This hotel was beautiful! But don't ever stay there on September 30th! Every year on that day the hotel shuts off the air conditioning and all restaurants are closed. The hotel did have a beach party with food and alcohol. We complained about this to the manager and received a gift cert for the spa which was very nice. I would definately go back to this hotel, but not on Sept 30! If you go, you must go to the pool bar(wet bar) and visit Victor. If you see Victor, you must sample the Mammawanna. It gets squirted right into your mouth! You can get it in a cup if you choose. Every day at the pool by the bar, there are activities at 4pm. Very fun! The beach was beautiful! Best I've seen, so far. Rooms were nice. Food was ok, not the greatest except for the Japanese restaurant. You must make reservations at the Japanese restaurant! Very good food. I had the salmon and shrimp and it was awesome! All the employees were sooooo nice, especially Anna and Eddie. The dico plays Dominican music but if you write down an American song the DJ will go online and pull up the song and play it.

<Content>Amazing Honeymoon I used this site to research destinations for my honeymoon. It helped us out a lot and ultimately helped us make our decision to go to the Majestic in Punta Cana.Upon arriving in Punta Cana it was dark and rainy as the hurricane was at it's tail end. We drove on a tour bus for about 40 minutes or so to the resort. The bus ride was the for me the worst part of our trip as their roads are in bad condition so the ride was pretty much like being tossed around in a boat. The bus was nice though and considering what we got when we arrived at the hotel the bus ride was worth it.The main entrance of the hotel is beautiful..the entire resort/hotel is beautiful. There were staff waiting for us upon arrival and as people on here had said they were quick to take our bags after checking in. We did let one of the workers bring our bags to our room but we stayed with him the entire time. Our room was very clean, large and one of the nicest if not the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in. We were so impressed with our terrace. We had an oceanview/beachfront room and the terrace was so nice we spent more time on it then on the beach. Although when we went to the beach it was only a few steps away. We used the wirlpool in the day to cool off..it was hot in the sun so the wirlpool was much appreciated.The hurricane had caused a lot of minor flooding but I must say you would never know it. The workers at this hotel are out cleaning 24/7. We were amazed to see so many people working and how quickly they worked. Housekeeping came everyday and tried to come at the same time about 9:30am but with being on our honeymoon we weren't getting up early. They did come back later in the afternoon to clean the room which we were happy with because most hotels they come once and if you aren't there too bad they don't come back. Our drinks were the same...always filled. The food was good..we had no problems at all. The steakhouse and the main buffet were our favorites. We always had lots to eat there. Alcohol at the main bar at least was very strong. Two drinks and I was done..this is not typical for me so I was surprised because so many people on here had said that the drinks were watered down. The coke..well it's definately NOT like our coke that's for sure. It comes from the US but it's just flat and tastes like it's missing something. But it's drinkable. The beach was gorgeous..I wish I was on it right now :( There is nothing... nothing bad we could say about this resort. I also loved that it was more of an adult resort although there were some children..it was just amazing and I would go back!!

<Content>great! Read Tripadvisor and it was all good reviews. And they were right! Great room with view of the pool and beach. It was our 25th and they had flowers, fruit and champaign in our room when we got there. Staff kept room nice. We left little gifts for them. I felt very safe there. This is coming from a country girl that had never been out of the US. Beach was so clean and beautiful. Pool bar was the best of all. The only thing I can say that I didn't like by the end of the trip was the food. I am in food service so I didn't like the temps. they kept there cold food at. I got sick the last night there. It was all tasting the same. Next time I will take more snacks from home with me. Really was great! I would like to try their new sister resort. We did one day trip. Did the four wheel ride. I was so scared when we left in a taxi.. But glad we did it, showed me how another country lives. Have to say, I was happy to get back to the resort where I felt safe...

<Content>Excellent stay at the Majestic I just returned from a stay at the Majestic Colonial from 9/27 - 10/4. This resort is truly Majestic. I've been to resorts in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, The Bahamas and Jamaica and this one stands out by far. It has matured into a 5* resort.Pros:-------* Beautiful beach - white sand, turquoise warm water* Customer Service - everyone wants to make you happy* Food - There is good selection from multiple restaurants. Surprisingly, we found the buffet to be the best. It's nice that some of the food there is cook to order* Pool - it is gorgeous and 1200ft pool with a swim up bar in the middle* Entertainment: Loved the anamacion team; Awesome beach party with professional circus; Great magic show* Drinks: Make sure you try their drink Majestic. Also..try the mamajuana.* Lobby: The lobby is stunningly beautiful. You'll sit there and not want to leave.Cons:--------* Mosquitoes: There are lots of mosquitoes at night. Even though the rooms are air conditioned, they still manage to get in and bite* Bathrooms: The bathroom configuration is awkward. There is only a frosted door that separates the toilet from the rest of the room.* Location: The beach is great, but there is not much to do in town. You'll likely never leave the resort* Sports Complex: This area is underdeveloped and not maintained. The tennis court was usable, but there was no soccer, basketball nor archery as advertised. Tips:-------* Bring mosquito repellent and even a mosquito coil* Bring US currency. We never even saw the local Dominican Currency while there. Even in Santo Domingo, everything is priced in USD.* Bring a stack of $US 1 bills for tipping * Book excursions early as they are only available on certain days* Only go on the Santo Domingo excursion if you are a history buff. It's a very long trip with little time to enjoy the sites.* Vendors have a hard time taking No as an answer. If you don't want to buy something, then just walk fast and avoid eye contact.

<Content>A Honest Review My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at the Majestic, along with 2 close friends of ours. We had requested rooms in Buildings 2 or 3 ahead of time through Ann Marie, and were happy to see that we were down the hall from eachother in Building 3, when we checked in. Our room was very spacious and comfortable. Some parts were a little beat up, but we were happy with the view of the pool and ocean. Our luck turned a little sour when we came back to our room later in the evening on our first night there. As I walked into the bathroom, the glass door fell from its hinges and shattered everywhere! We called down to the front desk, and housekeeping was in our room within 3-5 minutes to clean it up. A few managers came into the room to check it out as well- based on their reactions, I don't think it happens too often. We went back to the front desk to get a different room, and we were upgraded to a full ocean view room, still down the hall from our friends. (#3250) This room was beautiful and in much better shape than our previous room. We loved the room, with the exception of the leak in our bathroom ceiling. It was unfortunate to have Hurricane Kyle stop by on our vacation, or else the leak would probably have not been noticed at all. Other than the occasional cockroach visitor in our room, it was very comfortable.The food is plentiful and there was usually enough to choose from. We did experience some upset stomachs/not so pleasant bathroom experiences and definitely would recommend bringing an assortment of stomach medications, such as GasX, Immodium, Pepto, and Tums.The drinks were great- sometimes you will need to specify that you want rum added to the frozen drink: example- a majestic with rum or a pina colada with rum. We did an excursion to Saona Island through Hotelbeds. We were told that it was a 25 min ride to the excursion, with a speedboat and catamaran ride, snorkeling, and we'd be back by 630PM. Well- it was a good time, but it ended up being about an hour drive to another large bus of people, then another hour and a half drive to the speedboat, which then took us to the catamaran, which then took us to the island, with no snorkeling. Then the same on the way back. We got back at 800PM. All in all, we enjoyed the island, but would probably have prefered to know what was really going to happen ahead of time! We were a bit nauseous that evening upon returning to the hotel.If I were to come back to this hotel, I would come back due to the staff. They were so friendly and helpful. If they did not know the answer for you, they directed you to who would know. There was always someone around, and plenty of people serving at the bars and restaurants. A smile and a hola goes a long way here- and you will always get it returned right back at you.

<Content>First Time Traveling My boyfriend and i had never been out of the united states and we also had never traveled together. for us this trip was a lot of first of us. we loved it! when we were booking we found the magestic in a travel maginzine, everyone we asked never heard of it, so we decided to try it. we are not picky travelers and simple things make us happy. getting off the bus from the airport they greeted us with cold towels and drinks. check in was a breeze. they carried our bags and showed us to our room. the room was nice and clean. we had a veiw of the pool. food was great, the buffets had something for everyone. plus a lot of comfort food from home. the staff was great very friendly. the beach went on forever, the water was a little rough, and its windy all the time, but the wind helps with heat. the pool is large, we walked in it from one end to the other its a good way to cheak out the whole resort. we got massages at the spa witch felt so good after our long flight from maine. now with a new section of resort opening up we are thinking of going back. we have lots to comment on so feel free to ask....

<Content>Great Vacation Again! We booked another week (9/11 to 9/18) at the Majestic having stayed there last year. We were not dissapointed with the Majestic at all. We snuck in for a week between Hurricane Ike and the rains in mid September. Except for one brief shower and a few clouds, every day was sunny and hot. We had requested the room we had the year before and were given the room next door. Thank you Annemarie.Melvin and his staff kept us busy each day at the beach and at the pool in the afternoon. The bartenders were once again very attentive to our needs and the room staff kept our room very clean each day.Our only real issue was the very long wait in the bus at the airport and the time we had to leave the Majestic to return to the airport.. From picking up our luggage to arriving at the Majestic it took about 90 minutes with about an hour consumed sitting in the bus waiting for a few more passengers. We were then asked to be at the hotel lobby for the return trip to the airport 3.5 hours before our flight. I'll consider alternate transfers the next time.

<Content>Awesome Hotel We had heard many good things about this hotel but they were all understated. This was the best vacation we have ever experienced. We went there to celebrate our anniversary. Our travel agent was able to get us an upgrade to a bottom floor opposite the pool. This is building 2. When we arrived, check-in went smoothly and the door of our room had a Happy Anniversary banner on it. This suite was beautiful. The bath area had two sinks, a large walk-in shower and a jacuzzi. We also had another jacuzzi on the balcony. They had spread live flowers all over the area. To welcome us, there was a bottle of wine and an assortment of fruits and cheeses. Half the nights we were there, each night there was some wine and another treat waiting for us. The pool outside our room was the biggest one I had ever seen. It mendered over 1200 ft. through the property and had water jets every couple of hundred feet. The temperature was delightful and we spent many hours there. The beach was also great and clean and I enjoyed the topless bathing feature. One night we had a great beach party with food, drink, dancing and a limbo contest. One day for lunch they set up a 6 foot pan of paella on the beach. There were numerous restaurants and only two, Le Gourmet and Hatsuri needed reservations. They fill up quickly, so I'd recommend making reservations for your stay as soon as you check in. The best is the Hibachi cooking at Matsuri. The buffet place is great for breakfast every morning and the lunch and dinner is also good. The beach area has two places, Beef and Seafood. The Chauteaubriand is awesome. The seafood is just Ok. Stay away from the lobster. We had good fortune in the small casino. Your money will gom further if you use pesos because the minimums are less. If you get hungry late, there's a snack bar next to the casino that's open from 11pm to 4am. It seems that we had every rum drink imaginable. The best bar is the upper lobby bar staffed by Roberto, the best bartender we've ever encountered. Every drinking session was an adventure. Tipping is not required, but just a couple of dollars daily left for the maid(on the sink) and for your favorite bartender go a long way to getting great service. Finally, theren was good entertainment and dancing every night. No need to ever leave the resort. We can't wait to return to this wonderful place.

<Content>Dream Vacation We just returned from staying at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana, and it was by FAR the best resort we've ever been to. Usually we go to Mexico, and were a little weary on the Dominican experience in general because of mixed reviews we've heard from friends, but we decided to give it a try, not expecting much. But we were completely blown away by this resort!Check-in went okay. There was a bit of a mix up since we missed our flight and had to catch a later one, but it got cleared up right away. We recieved a free upgrade to a ground level room which consisted of TWO jacuzzi tubs, one indoor, one outdoor, as well as swim-up access to the gorgeous, lagoon-style pool. Needless to say, the room itself was as gorgeous and amazing as it sounds. The bed was huge and SUPER comfortable. I usually have trouble sleeping while on vacation but slept like a baby here.The lobby area was amazing as well, consisting of two huge levels and two bars. And all the drinks were perfect! The food started off kinda blah, but seemed to get better as the week progressed. The Japanese Tapanyaki experience is a must!! My husband hates japanese food but it was the most delicious meal of the week! Everything there tasted perfect and the chef and servers were really friendly. The Gourmet restaurant served really good food too. The Mexican/Dominican restaurant was a bit of a let down. Everything tasted a little off so we left right away and finished our dinner at the buffet. Buffet food was pretty standard. Had a pasta station and pizza, along with a salad bar and the other usual buffet foods. There's a snack bar that stays open from 11pm -4am if you get a late night craving, and they serve the BEST burgers and nachos. You even see the guy cutting up the tortillas to make the nachos fresh! Ketchup tasted normal as well, which is odd for Dominican or Cuba. Breakfasts were good too.This resort had the nicest beach we've ever been to, hands down. Powder white sand and you can see colourful fish swimming by your feet!Mosquitos in general were pretty bad. But I brought After Bite so I was fine with that. The staff and bartenders were generally very nice and a lot speak english. The only thing that got a bit annoying were the photographers and the night the merchants that came in to sell their jewellery. They're both pretty forceful, even when you say no. Once a photographer from the resort was wearing jeans and just jumped in to the pool to take pictures of people. I found we were hiding from them quite often!Even though it rained the majority of the days we were there, it was still easily the best vacation my husband and I have ever been on. On rainy days the Animation Crew would come around with cookies, and board games which was nice. The entertainment was alright. We only watched the Michael Jackson show, the International Show, and the Magic Show. The Magic Show was really good!I would definitely come back (maybe to try the new Majestic Elegance next door!) and I would recommend this resort to any couple. It's more suited for couples, as the rooms are very open concept...no separate bathroom area really.

<Content>Never A Dull Moment We had the time of our lives at the majestic. The service there was always friendly and treated us like royalty. There was a lot of activities held periodically throughout each day which was really nice because you were never bored. The Animation team was top notch, moskito boy ,jesus, melvin, cony, just to name a few, they gave us a real welcome feeling and they knew how to make you feel at home. The food was delicious our ocean view room was incredible. Real nice architectural layout easy to find everything.All in All I know we will be going back

<Content>best beach/superb resort/great managment I was peasantly suprised to sit and talk to Carlos ( the general manager) about my experience at the resort. Carlos seemed to take a genuine interest in all the guests he talked to making all feel extremely comfortable whether at dinner or at the beach. I would most like to mention the following people for their outstanding help and courtisy. The reception staff consists of Herlio (manager) Keylay, Yecy, Yanet, Carlos (tremendous help with my computer thanks for taking the time), Orlando and Heydi. They we're no doubt the best staff I have ever encountered at a resort. My forever new friends Juandi, Denny and Francesca provided the service and smiles which set the tone for my 9 day stay (great bar staff). All our excursions we're flawlessly handled the food perfectly prepared by chef Daniel and staff making everyday a welcome surprise. Not only would I highly recomend this resort to any first second or third time traverler to the Dominic Republic, but I'm already planning my next trip there. I've traveled to many of the islands in the Carribean and have found this to be my favorite five star pick.

<Content>Unimpressed! I just got back from my future sister in law's 4 day bachelorette party at the Majestic Colonial. While this hotel is very beautiful, we were not happy with the service. There was no waitor service around the pool nor by the beach, so if you wanted a drink you would have to get up and go to the bar each time. The male staff seemed to undress you with their eyes and really just had poor communication skills. The food was terrible, my sister in law actually got sick one of the nights we were there. Our room had tiny little ants everywhere, we all left with a million bites around our feet and ankles. They had a flea market set up on the property one of the nights and the staff that worked it were very pushy in trying to get you to buy things. I just feel like if you are staying in a 4 or 5 star resort I shouldn't have to feel like I was be harassed while trying to walk through the resort. I must say though that the beach and ocean were amazing! All in all we had a good time but only because of the company we were with. I would definitely return to Punta Cana because the beach was so beautiful but I would never stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Welcome to Heaven on Earth I just returned from the Majestic Colonial. I had a blast. Unfortunately I had some bad luck with the weather, but that is no one's fault, but my own for choosing to go there in the hurricane season. Even with all the rain we got I did go on there Saffari Tour thru the mountains and got a chance to see how the people of this country live. It should make you be thankful for what you have.  The resort was excellent. I had and awesome suite overlooking the beach with a private balcony and jacuzzi. The staff was always willing to jump through hoops to help make your stay a memorable one. I would like to put out a very special Thank You to Jenny. This girl was awesome and always there with a smile. She did everything in her power to please you. What a great girl. Also a Thank You to Janet and Carlos at the front desk. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to go to the Domican Republic. I myself am already thinking about my return to paradise.  This is definetely a must if your going to the D. R,

<Content>Homesick for the Majestic If it is possible to feel completely at home, while also having the sensation of being in paradise; that is how I felt during my week at the Majestic. If you have had a chance to look at the resort photos, you already know that the resort is gorgeous. What you will discover, if you visit this resort, is amazing hospitality. After visiting four resorts this year, with two of my best friends, the Majestic is definitely my favourite vacation destination.Following travelling ten hours, it was refreshing to meet Hilario, at the reception desk. Check-in was efficient and a breeze. The welcome cocktail, as well as the warm greeting were equally appreciated. We were also happy that Hilario assigned us a room, by the pool bar and ocean, which suited us perfectly.Dinner was always an experience. I believe the service, as well as the food, was exceptional. I must thank Rahdame, Henry, Nelson, Joe, Christian and Candida, for their attention and efficiency. I admit that I still crave the chateaubriand, from the Steakhouse. Additionally, I have to suggest that you make reservations at the Japanese Restaurant; both for the theatre of it, as well as for the mouth-watering food.No other resort can beat Majestic's exceptional pool. When not in the ocean, you would find us close to the pool bar. All of our afternoon pool parties were facilitated by our favourite bartenders Odani and Corpo. In spite of ourselves, Odani taught us to enjoy not only champagne, but also a little mammajuana.One thing we love is a resort with a dance focus. Everyday we would take the dance lessons offered by Melvin, in addition to the other members of Animation; Pablo, Jesus, Connie, Mosquito, Pamela and Nina. Then at night, Animation, as well as Martirez, gave us the opportunity to practise the merengue, bachata, and salsa at the disco. Too much fun! Also, what is a resort trip without water aerobics? Individually, Leo and Jon instructed entertaining and challenging water aerobics everyday at noon. I also must give my respect to Elsa, for kicking my bottom, in step-aerobics. I know that the individuals of the Animation team helped us to create a very entertaining and memorable vacation experience. In particular, I would like to thank Melvin. To all, I am very grateful. To sum it up, Animaci贸n excelente! One of my favourite people on the resort, and you will have many favourites, was Angela. Many days and evenings, I'd find Angela cleaning the bathroom by the pool and beach buffet. Angela always had a heart warming smile and a kind word. She was totally a breath of fresh air. Please, give her my best.While the Majestic itself is a jewel, the people of the Majestic are the real treasures. I feel very lucky to have stepped out of my life for a week, and met such wonderfully generous people. I am homesick for the Majestic. In fact, my friends and I are already planning a return trip in January. Maybe, we'll see you there too?

<Content>Don't believe the hype!!! We went for my brother in law's wedding last August. There's a big hype with this hotel....Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype! This trip was our first in the Caribbean..... It was a very disappointing experience. We had so many problems that I don't even know where to start. They gave a room with the garden view, (I forgot the room number) but it was located in the ground floor. The Backdoor latch wont close, a friend of ours told us that the lock in their backdoor is broken got curious and checked ours and alas....Our lock was broken too! Make matters worst, we had to call maintenance for our key to work 5-8 times!!!! They said it was the battery, or the way we open the door...well how many ways can you really enter the card the wrong way? On our 3rd night, I woke up to go to the bathroom, and believe it or not the bathroom door came off...it was a solid glass door! This was at 2am!!!! It took me a while to put down the door co'z it was soooooooo heavy! Called maintenance to come and fix it and of course no answer and was told it will be fix in the morning... Imagine, we didn't have a door to cover us up when we go to the washroom. They didn't come till the afternoon to fix the door. We thought that was it....the worst was yet to come...Our last night.... we found a cockroach by our closet...it was a big one!!!! And I am terrified with insects, so imagine me yelling and screaming!Other than that, the food was ok...except for the disgusting stuff they serve at the Chinese Restaurant...they need a new chef! The view was great and the pool was awesome!

<Content>married at the majestic Stayed from Sept. 9-16 at the Majestic, then travelled to Excellence Punta Cana.Beach: Soft white sand, gorgeous clear blue water, very warm with gentle waves for swimming and some okay snorkelling. No difficulty finding a beach chair. No towel games. The beach waiter came around every hour or so, and drinks took about 10-15 minutes to get from the beach waiter (in contrast, it would take you about 5 minutes to walk up to the beach bar, get a drink, and make it back to your seat, as the bar is not directly on the beach). Hint: The punta cana area sits on the eastern coast of the D.R., with the Atlantic Ocean in the northern part, and the carribean sea in the southern part. If you want a nice beach, pick a resort along Bavaro Beach, which is the Carribean Sea. Our resort further north of the airport was closer to the Atlantic Ocean, which meant the beach was way too dangerous to swim in due to big waves (I'm a strong swimmer and I wouldn't have gone in). Room: As part of the wedding package, we were upgraded to a 1-bedroom suite, which was on the 4th floor. The elevators were sometimes working, and sometimes not, but we are able-bodied and it helped us get some exercise. The room was pretty clean, except for the giant hairball left by someone else on the top ledge in the shower that stayed there for the whole week - we named it cousin it. It became a bit of a joke just to see if or when it would disappear. The bed was an average hotel bed - hard with the occasional spring sticking out a little bit. Air conditioning worked well, no musty smell. Our power didn't go off, but it did for everyone else we were travelling with. Some occasional very small ants around the bathroom sinks, but we have had the same at all of the 5-star hotels we have stayed at in Mexico - I think they just go with the humid climate. We also had a Gecko in our room, but I figured he was eating the bugs, so didn't worry about it. Food: If you've been to a 4 or 5 star resort in Mexico, then to compare the food, think similar, but down a notch. When you drive to the resort, you'll see that they are poor and have nothing, so it's amazing that they can provide what they do at these resorts. And what they can get is a little bit limited, so it makes for them putting together some interesting combinations. The food at the buffet sits under lights, but don't be fooled, they weren't exactly warming lights, because the food was usually lukewarm at best. So we stuck to salads, breads, cold foods, or the made-to-order stations, and had better luck. Everyone in our group had at least 1 day where they were a little under the weather, so bring some basic over the counter medications and you should be able to cope. Drinks: Bring insulated travel mugs. They don't have many brands of higher-end name brand liquor, but they have some, and you must ask. It's true that their frozen drinks are watery, and you have to ask to make sure they add liquor - often, they will ask you, with rum? The lobby bars and martini bars make the drinks in the traditional blender-style, and they are better, but these bars are way too far from the beach and the pool to use as your drink source throughout the day. Bugs: Our ankles were eaten by sand-fleas or no-seeums on the beach (not sure what they were). It didn't affect our days on the beach, but at night, our ankles were itchy. Bring bug spray - we had spray with 35% DEET. The mosquitos are small, fast, and do come out at dusk. Many people walking around with numerous bites. I kept After-Bite with me at all times. Climate: Thunderstorms at night, very hot and sunny in the day. The beach has a nice breeze - there was no breeze by the pool.Pool: Big, no problem finding shade or sun. No towel games. Quiet parts and noisier parts. Entertainment: Too wiped out from the sun to stay up late for the 10pm shows, but did see a little bit, and it was the traditional resort-style entertainment, with laughs produced from hotel guests doing silly things, or shows that gave you something to watch, but didn't really entertain. Service: Polite, but not always friendly. Staff didn't really try to speak English, but the front desk people were better. Overall: It was a nice vacation, but we came here for the wedding service they provide (which was perfect), and we like to try different resorts, so I know we won't stay here again.

<Content>A best buy in the Caribbean!!! My review will be rather lengthy and completely candid. I hopethat in reading it, anyone contemplating the Majestic Colonialwill feel fully informed about this wonderful resort. I will coverall bases starting with the planning of the trip to the departurefrom the airport.Planning: Check a lot of websites about any vacation destinationyou may consider. For this trip, the best deal price wise camefrom [---]. It's the first time I've usedthis source but it won't be the last.Assuming you have selected Punta Cana as your destination,include a private transfer from the airport to the resort of yourchoice. In doing so, your stay at the airport after luggageretrieval will be minutes. Those who elect to save a little moneyby not using a private livery can be at the airport up to an hourwaiting for a van to fill up. Then it is a 30-40 minute ride to theresorts area of Punta Cana.The Majestic Colonial: It is in a word SUPERB!! When enteringthe lobby you will get the feeling you made a good resort selection. The registration is quick and friendly. During thisprocess someone will give you a complimentary fruity drink called a majestic. A nice touch.Room selection: Our trip was mid-September, the low seasonin the Dominican so there should be some flexibility should aparticular room be not to your liking. All rooms have four digits.The first indicates the building. Bldgs. 2 and 3 are preferredas they face the pool. Bldg 1 faces an older and not so nicelooking resort while bldg 4 faces new construction of a resort.The second digit is the floor . There are 4 and I would avoid thefirst floor for one reason. Anyone will have access to your roomif you forget to lock the sliding door to the patio. The last 2 digits are the room # itself. Plenty of elevators to the upper levels.There are different room sizes and prices. We selected aJr. suite ( smallest and lowest price ) For 2 people a jr. isexcellent. This small room has over 500 sq. ft. of space!!Marble flooring throughout and a king size bed ( in our roomanyway ) The room has a jetted tub but it is out in an open area.It was of no concern to my wife and I. You may read in other reviews that the shower / toilet area offered no privacy. Not soin my case as both the shower and toilet areas had 6 footopaque glass doors that cannot be seen through. The shower is huge and again all marble. There is a decent amount ofstorage space for your clothes, a safe for valuables, and a mini-bar ( more on that later )The grounds: A really stunning place and one of the cleanestI have seen anywhere. The groundskeepers are working almostaround the clock to keep the Maj. Col. super tidy.The staffers: Everyone is very friendly and ready to be of assistance. Learn a few basic Spanish words and phrasesand it will make things a lot easier in communicating.You can get a paperback book from Amazon.com for $2.00that has commonly used phrases. Most of the staffers speakpassable to good English.The restaurants: This is the one area where I have somenegative issues, but to a relatively minor degree. The Maj.Col. has 7 restaurants, 2 of which require reservations fordinner ( Le Gourmet and Matsuri--Matsuri only for the teppenyakiwhich is like a Benihana ) One of the issues is that in lowseason, not all restaurants are open every day. This is notmentioned in the resort webpage ( it should be.....full disclosureMaj. Col. ) As a result we only dined at Le Gourmet once( the steaks there are very good ) and Matsuri was not openon any day we were there. On Thursday evenings the resorthas a beach party so all but one restaurant is closed for dinner.This is not a good policy for the resort to implement. There is aCaribbean food place ( Taino ) decent food, nothing memorableserved buffet style, I liked the goat meat.There is an open air restaurant near the beach serving buffetlunches and sit down dinners ( beef , chops and seafood beingthe specialties ) The chateaubriand is fine except they substitutethe mashed potatoes with french fries so it isn't really achateaubriand. There are some flies in this restaurant, but it is open air so this is not a major downer for me. In the sit downareas, the resort does not change its menus either.The biggest mistake the Maj. Col. makes in the buffets is thatthe food in trays is generally cold. The reason is their  heatlamps are the size of a night light!!! I don't know anyone wholikes cold scrambled eggs or sausage. On the plus side, the buffets have chefs who will prepare hot meals at any time of theday that are very tasty. So just be wary of the buffet trays beforeyou load up a plate. The buffet salads are good and the desserts are ok. This is not haute cuisine, which I'd neverexpect at an All inclusive. If I want the very best in dining, I wouldtravel to Paris or to Italy.Beverages: The room has a minibar stocked with soft drinks,bottled water and Presidente beer. There is a limit of 2 beersper day in the minibar but the suds drinkers can have all theywant at the resort bars. Leave a $2.00 tip for the minibarstockman and you'll get exactly what you want. Leave a note withthe tip indicating your preferences.As to mixed drinks, they are fruity and not very alcoholic. I don't have a problem with this. The resort doesn't want its guestsgetting hammered!! Jimmy at the lobby bar makes a terrificlemon frozen daquiri. For you boozers, premium stock isavailable at an extra fee.The POOL: The best I have seen anywhere in all my travels.It is 1200 feet long, in a snaky shape. There are sections wideenough for swimmers to do laps. There are areas with jacuzzijets as well. The pool is extremely clean. The water depth isa uniform 3 ft. 9 inches ( that's 1.15 meters for you metric unitfolks ) There are also a couple of kiddie pools for the toddlers.As an aside, this resort does not cater to children so unlessyour kids will be happy at the pool and the beach with nothingelse to entertain them, perhaps you should consider anothervenue. Hey!! this ain't Disney!! Mucho beach chairs and palapasto go around. The quieter part of the pool is closest to the lobbywith the fun and games closer to the beach.The beach: Again lots of chairs and palapas. A very cleanbeach with soft sand that doesn't get hot even at high noon,and no rocks or shells in the water. The beach is Atlantic Oceanwater but surprisingly not too wavy. All in all, one of the finerbeaches I have seen.WARNING: for the prudes and those bringing the kiddies.Women can go topless. Didn't bother me save for the fatbroads who should just know better about undressing inpublic.Tipping: LIke some other reviewers, I recommend bringing100 dollar bills for tips. Use them to inspire better than theexcellent service you're going to get anyway. Tip the chambermaid daily ( 2 or 3 bucks will do ) Do the same for the serversin the restaurants, including the folks who just clean your table of empty plates at the buffets. $1.00 per drink at thebars will get you better drinks in time. These guys rememberthe guests who remember them. Before you leave for home,give $5.00 to the nice kid at the beach towel hut. He speaksno English and has the most boring job at the resort, yet he hasa ready smile for everyone despite the tedium of his work.The bugs: Some reviewers have complained mightily aboutinsects. They just weren't an issue for my wife and I. Goprepared though. Bring a repellant ( 30 % DEET ). Themosquitos are tiny, the size of gnats. They can be bothersomeat dawn and at dusk but they go away during the day.There are sand fleas at the beach and their bites will itch so pack some type of itch relief. They are not a major problem though. Show me a beach without sandfleas!! Be sure tokeep the sliding door to your balcony closed to keep themosquitos out of your room.Wrapup time: It's possible that some travelers had a badexperience at the Maj. Col., hence some negative reviews.We all know some folks just like to [---] no matter what.I cannot fathom the bad reviews. The Majestic lives up to its name and it has to be among the best bargains anywhere inthe Caribbean. If you're traveling on a tight budget this resortcannot be beat. I may never go back to the Dom. Rep. as thereare too many places in the world I haven't seen. However, ifI do make a return visit it will assuredly be at the magnificentMajestic Colonial.Departure: Get to the airport at least 2 hours prior to flight time.Americans need not pay the $10.00 exit tax.One last thing, if you do have issues with this or any other resorttalk to someone in charge as I did with 2 restaurant managers. They want tourists to recommend their venues and as the oldsaying goes  the squeaky wheel gets the grease

<Content>Majestic Colonial, Punta Cana Majestic Review Sept 13th 鈥?Sept 19thJust returned and wanted to make sure I got my review posted. I apologize in advance that I am the worlds worst at remembering names of the staff 鈥?but they were all wonderful.1. Flight arrival 鈥?We had booked through Cheap Caribbean and just like last year they find you quickly and have your shuttle bus waiting for the hotel. A side note on this is that the Majestic is one of the closer hotels from the airport and that was important to us. After a long flight, we didn鈥檛 want to spend hours on a shuttle.2. Check in: Perfect. Cold cloth upon arrival and the Majestic (drink) that I had so been looking forward do. We were greeted with a 鈥渨elcome home鈥?and shown to our room.3. Room: Perfect. We had been there last year and had requested the same room area. We were in Room 2245鈥?.beautiful pool and ocean view. 4. Food: No complaints from us. Ate everywhere but the Japanese rest. We really had no interest in that this year. Did make it to the French place twice. You have every type of food you could possibly want and if anyone complains that it isn鈥檛 cooked the way they want it, that鈥檚 their fault. They are more than happy to cook items to your specific request. We ate breakfast and lunch every day at the main place by the lobby 鈥?mainly because I wanted the AC to start off the day and needed it at lunch time. LOL, I also went back there most evenings for dessert. 5. Service 鈥?as always the staff went above and beyond. We tipped often and always left money for the maid. I do find it hard to tip at some of the dinners, etc., as you have so many people waiting on you at the same meal. But we tried to get as many as we could.6. Activities 鈥?Animation staff does a wonderful job whether it be on the beach, by the swim up bar or the evenings activities. My husband made a lot of new friends while playing volleyball.I want to comment about some other things I鈥檝e seen discussed on the forums. The snorkeling off their beach is about as good as you get out on the reef trips. We had a lot of fun sprinkling bread or banana in the water and having tons of fish around. My husband did the reef trip again and except for some coral, the fish were just as good off the beach.Food 鈥?no one can truthfully complain about the food. There are 100鈥檚 of choices and if you are that particular about your food, then you should not to go an all inclusive and rent a place where you can cook your own.Bugs 鈥?they were not an issue. Did get a few mosquito bites at some point, but geez, it鈥檚 the beach, it鈥檚 the Dominican鈥f you didn鈥檛 see any flies or something I鈥檇 more concerned about what they were doing to prevent this. It wouldn鈥檛 be environmentally friendly.Bubba mugs/kegs are a great idea. We used ours most of the days. I also loved filling mine with ice to take to the beach. We took big round floats and used them in the surf and the pool (we did this last year) and we left them for others to use when we came home this time.More people dressed for dinner this year. I think that鈥檚 a note that all ladies would like to know about. And it鈥檚 fun to dress up in summer dresses. Guys have it made with a pair or 2 of long pants and a couple of shirts with collars. All in all, I would highly recommend this resort to anyone. If you have questions, please contact me.And last but certainly not least 鈥?a HUGE thank you to Annemarie for making sure that we had a wonderful anniversary. Oh and it鈥檚 cute now, they have Happy Anniversary, Honeymooners and Just Married banners for the doors.

<Content>Magic at the Majestic! I had the pleasure of staying at the Majestic Colonial for one week with two of my girlfriends. We had a fabulous time at this resort... the weather was amazing (but prepare to sweat 24/7!) and the accommodations were roomy and comfortable. Since we chose to go in the off-season, the resort seemed quite empty at times, but I personally loved this aspect because we received extra attention from the staff (many of whom knew us on a first-name basis), and it also made the ambience more relaxing. I would like to direct attention to a very special group of people who work at this resort, because they are the ones who made our trip unforgettable... The Animation Team, as they are collectively called, are a group of young men and women who run the entertainment at the resort. They direct all kinds of activities during the day, ranging from dance lessons to step aerobics to silly games you can choose to participate in, and a nightly 'show' that often involves audience participation. They are all very excitable and so much fun to be around, and they always aim to please, so lose your inhibitions and learn to dance the Taki Taki and the merengue. As some of the only single girls in a resort full of couples and families, we definitely got more attention from the guys than we otherwise would have, but this was a great way to learn the merengue and more about the Dominican culture. The more Spanish you know, the better, so make the effort to use what you know... but your English will be easily understood as well. Some people whom you should seek out during your stay include:Martirez and Elsa... If you are a gym-goer and want to stay fit during your stay, head to the small but homey gym on the premises. There you will meet Martirez and Elsa, two wonderful people who will be your personal trainers. Martirez looks like he belongs on the cover of Men's Fitness magazine. He is very patient, knowledgeable, and curious about you, and he loves to talk baseball since he used to play minor league ball and actually grew up with some of the best MLB players out there today. And, of course, he's an amazing dancer :-). Elsa is a super-fit and super-friendly aerobics instructor who will always greet you with a radiant smile... but don't be mistaken, she becomes a drill sergeant in the gym!!! Talk with her about her family, especially her daughters, and you will learn about love.Pablo, Leo, Jesus, Jan, and Melvin are some of the most visible members of the team, often found near the center of the pool or on the beach. They are FANTASTIC dancers and want to teach you all about Taki Taki and merengue. These guys are fun and want you to have fun, so make the effort to get to know them! And don't forget to greet Eddie, the sports bar DJ, who will keep the beat pumping with the hottest hits during your trip! Walter El Mosquito is in a class by himself... when you see him you will understand his nickname... he marches to the beat of his own drum, and if you are lucky enough to catch a glimpse of him, you will split your side laughing while watching him in action. Besides Elsa, we unfortunately didn't get to know the girls as well as the guys, but Lina, Coni, Pamela, and Espaghetti deserve a special shout-out. They are all beautiful and tons of fun as well, and we encourage any male travelers to seek them out and dance with them. Get to know the Dominican people during your stay. Whether it be the man cleaning the pool or handing out the towels (Francicos), or serving you at the restaurant (look for Henry at the beach palapa), they are at your service, and by making the effort to talk with them, you will discover the friendly and loving nature that embodies the Dominican culture and spirit.Many thanks to all of these people who made our week in Punta Cana truly unforgettable.... we will miss you all very much and hope to return sometime soon.

<Content>Majestic Colonial Punta Cana - A little bit of heaven We just returned from the beautiful Majestic Colonial. This was a second visit to this resort. We looked at other options but selected the MC again because of our previous experience. The resort is breathtakingly beautiful. The service was excellent and the staff was so friendly and attentive. The beach is what separates this resort from the others. The pool, restaurants, and beach is within a short walk of all the rooms. Most of the room's view either overlooks the meandering pool or the beach. This complex is not very large which makes it more appealing. We walked next door to the Grand Bahia Principe which is larger and it did not compare to the Majestic.We are planning to return next summer with the entire family. By that time the Majestic Elegance will be open which is an adult only resort. The grounds for this resort join the MC.If you are looking for paradise and want a little bit of heaven - go to the Majestic Colonial. You will not be disappointed!!!!!!

<Content>Majestic Fantastic We just returned from the Majestic at Punta Cana, we have been to the Dominican Republic three times and can say hand on heart that the Majestic is by far the best, it lives up to it鈥檚 five star rating. The place was spotless. We were greeted at reception with a cold Majestic Cocktail drink which went down well, the reception staff were excellent, we were booked in by Carlos, he was great. I would also like to mention Donald and Francisco who went out all stops to arrange an excellent room for us. Everyone could not do enough for us. The resort is a beautiful place to go to relax. All the workers from the grounds keepers, cleaners, those in the restaurants, the cooks were so kind always had a smile on their faces and would always say hello. The daily shows were excellent, the animation team were fantastic.The pool is fantastic, never crowded, we swam near the Spa section and most times had the entire section just for us, waiters come up all the time to top up your drinks.The beach is fantastic, white sands, very clean, beautiful clean warn sea, again never crowded, you could always find a nice peaceful spot.The food was very good, we are vegetarian, and there was plenty of choice. All the waiters were fantastic but I would like to mention Wilfredo, he was brilliantIt is the first time I can say we felt sad leaving. We came as customers and left as friends. We will defiantly be coming back to this place. Don鈥檛 hesitate book it!!!! You will not regret it I promise.

<Content>Wow for the Majestic We just returned from the Majestic at Punta Cana and we had such a wonderful time. We were a little worried about the weather, with it being hurricane season and with Ike in particular out in the Atlantic. But, we could not of asked for better weather. The resort is a beautiful place to go to relax. The people are very friendly and helpful. Once we arrived, my husband realized he had left his laptop case on the bus from the airport, and starting with the bellman all the way to the hotel desk people and our on-site trip rep. Mario, all got involved and had the bus located and had him return to the hotel and bring the laptop. My husband was very grateful and appreciated all the efforts they all took. Our room was beautiful and kept clean every day. You had a variety of very tasty food to choose from. We especially enjoyed the pool and bar where the animation team kept things going. They are a great group and very good at their jobs of getting people to join in and meet other people and just have a good time. We definitely will return to this wonderful, relaxing oasis.

<Content>Majestic was better than expected! This was our first trip to an all-inlcusive since our honeymoon (10 yrs ago) at the Sandels in St. Lucia. The place is very beautiful and the beach set-up with the straw-made huts was awesome. I do recommend you go out early in the morning and set your towels since they fill up quickly. The ocean , although not the best was still nice. The food was average, although the Japanese and indoor buffet were great. We had ocean-view room which was awesome, there is always a beautiful breeze in Punta Cana. The staff was very friendly even though they were not always the quickest when it came to service. Overall i would recommend this place if you want to go and relax and not do too much besides go to the beach and pool and dinner at night. Its a great place to get away!

<Content>Stay at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana My family recently stayed at the Majestic Colonial for a family vacation. We have never encountered such an accomodating, friendly wonderful staff! Everyone could not do enough for us! Unfortunately we don't remember everyones names, but Franchesco stood out as one of the animators there, He made dancing, water volleyball, and other activities a blast! From the staff at the lobby, to the bathroom attendant Lourdes, everyone was helpful, friendly and polite! The gentlemen who ran the shows daily at 10:00 PM was awesome! Daily shows and activities is something we looked forward to everyday! Drinks and food were plentiful. We especially enjoyed the Japanese restaurant. We were amazed at the cleaniness of the hotel, including the beach! Rose, our cleaning woman would thoughtfully fill our jacuzzi daily with bubble bath and lined it with flowers for an added touch! We recommend this hotel to anyone, and would definately come back for a visit!

<Content>Beautiful hotel, fantastic holiday We stayed at Majestic for our 2-week holiday, 5-19 June. It鈥檚 a beautiful hotel and we had a great time. Check-in Check in was quick and easy without any problems.Grounds 5/5Amazing! The layout of the buildings with a fantastic swimming pool that runs through the hotel grounds is beautiful. The design of the grounds is superb, everything is well kept and wherever you are at the hotel the surroundings are beautiful. We loved that there were so many palms, plants, gardens with ponds and fountains. All of this truly makes the hotel majestic both day and night. There is no surprise that with such amazing grounds the hotel is busy with weddings. And neighbouring Majestic Elegance construction didn鈥檛 bother us at all. Weather During our 2-week stay the weather was very good overall. We had one day of rain from 11am till early morning next day. Apart from that it was sunny and hot all the time.   Beach 5/5Breathtaking, amazing and so long! We were very happy that there was no towel game and we didn鈥檛 need to get up at early hours to get a palapa. The beach in front of Majestic is wide and there are lots of spots to choose from. Ocean looks beautiful from the beach. Water was warm and calm during our stay. There are some stones on the left side, but the right side is just sand. We did some snorkelling, saw some nice fish but I would recommend going for a trip to some of the great snorkelling spots in the area. We walked along the beach a few times and Majestic beach seemed much nicer and less crowded than Bahia, Riu and Iberostar鈥檚 beach. Pool 5/5We only spent a few hours of our entire stay at the pool. We preferred to stay on the beach with white sand and comfortable breeze. But still the pool at Majestic is the best pool I have ever seen. Room 5/5We stayed in room 3241 鈥?building 3, second floor, garden view and partial ocean view. The room was specious and always cleaned well. The bed was very comfortable and Jacuzzi worked well. The bathroom/toilet layout didn鈥檛 bother us at all. The balcony is huge and we enjoyed having coffee there and looking at beautiful views. If you like spending a bit of time on the balcony then I recommend asking for a room in building 2 or 3. If not, then it doesn鈥檛 matter where you are at Majestic. The fridge is stocked up daily with water, beer and soft drinks. And also we had face towels in the room- 2 changed daily. Service 5/5 All staff was very friendly, helpful and although they work hard and long hours they all keep smiling. Nothing is a problem for them and they do their best to make your holiday special. And yes, some staff do not speak English but we were in the country where Spanish is an official language so it was up to us to learn a few words and phrases. Please remember that the staff do not get the education we are used to at home, but they could teach European hotels鈥?staff a lot about service and smile! Food 3/5Unfortunately, here we had a few problems. Yes, the choice is very wide and even very picky eaters will find something they like. There is no problem with that. We both got sick. Hubby got sick on 4th day (before any trip), I got sick in the second week. We were very careful with water, using only purified water for brushing teeth, we didn鈥檛 drink any dairy cocktails, avoiding lettuce, creamy cakes etc. We do believe that we got sick at the hotel. (At our 1st trip which was only half day we didn鈥檛 eat anything and at our 2nd trip we both were already ill.)It didn鈥檛 spoil our holiday, we still were able to enjoy the hotel and relax. Entertainment 4/5The animation staff work hard to entertain everybody around the hotel. There are activities at most times. We saw a few shows 鈥搒ome very good, other so so. The Michael Jackson show was the best. We visited the casino at the hotel a few times 鈥?it鈥檚 small but pleasant. I was lucky to win on the machine all the money my husband lost on the roulette! TripsWe did Caribbean Festival that was fun and staff made sure that everyone was having good time. Bavaro Runners was very informative and included horse riding, Dominican school and home visit, cigars 鈥渇actory鈥?and Macao beach. It was very well organised. Overall we had a great time. And we will definitely be back one day!Big thank you to Richard  AnnMarie for your help and hospitality. And thank you everyone on TA Forum for your advice and helping us choosing Majestic.

<Content>Love the Animation team! Just returned from a week at the Majestic with my daughter and niece. We had a blast and really enjoyed the whole vacation. We were lucky to miss all the action of the Hurricanes, we seemed to time it just right. We want to thank the Animation Team, especially Walter the tennis pro, that I had the pleasure of hitting with several mornings. He gave me a great tennis match and one afternoon we all enjoyed a game of doubles. He was a great sport and he has worked very hard at learning the english language, it was greatly appreciated. We also enjoyed Martinez in the gym and Elsa who did a wonderful job at the aerobics classes.My daughter gave Melvin a run at the ping pong table, but we told him we would be back next year so he could practice up for a rematch! Hopefully he understands it's a craft she practices, he had no idea what he was up against.The people make this country and they've done a great job in finding some terrific employees.Like several other reviews, we noticed the flies. They were unreal. I did notice them spraying on one of the last days of our vacation, hopefully that will help.The phone system needs improvement. They charge you $2.00 just to get an outside line and they disconnect you regularly, it's somewhat of a joke, but you are forced to deal with it.

<Content>Mixed The folks who work there were awesome at every level. Keyla, Hilario, Angel, and Carlos at the front desk were so friendly and helpful. The pool is great, too.The food here was unspeakably awful. So bad that I kept eating just to see how they could one-up themselves in terms of horrible fare. Stay as far away from the seafood restaurant as humanly possible. You have been warned. The various buffets are lame; everything tastes the same, which is to say a combination of bland and gross. I don't know what they do to it, but I am certain that they either don't taste the food or could care less what it tastes like. This is very disconcerting when the main draw of all-inclusive (for me) is the food. The property itself was OK. The rooms were very nice. However, beyond a very small street of overpriced stores and the outdoor entertainment center (easily the worst Michael Jackson ever. Again, we stayed just to see how bad it could get, and it did), there really isn't much else. The tennis courts are surrounded by construction, the casino is super-tiny, and the dance club was average. If you want someplace to stay where you are close to the beach and just want to chill by the pool all day, then this place is fine. For an overall experience I would not get my hopes up.

<Content>Enjoyable family vacation (long review) After reading hundreds of reviews on TA, I chose this hotel for our summer vacation 8/22-8/28. We are a family of 4, kids 17 and 12 and this is our 7th AI hotel, having been to DR, Cancun, Jamica, and numerous cruises, so my review is based on comparisons.I booked it with Beth at vacation mart, where the price was the lowest and we used AA freq. flyer miles. We were supposed to arrive on 8/20 but due to a sick family member (not going with us) we were delayed 2 days. This was the first time I bought trip insurance (only $17 pp) and I鈥檓 glad I did as it should pay for the 2 days of the hotel not used.At PC airport, be prepared to pay $10 per person for a tourist card which you hand back 5 seconds later. I got a free luggage cart but be aware you can鈥檛 take the carts outside. I e-mailed ibkservicios to arrange for airport transfers. I find it is a comfort factor when you get off the plane and there is someone waiting for you. We were warmly greeted by Bronley, the manager, and in 30 minutes we arrived.The hotel is gorgeous, marbled two tier lobby, fountains through-out, giant 1200鈥?pool the length of one building, beautiful beach.Check-InOur first disappointment came at check-in at 3:30pm on Friday. I had requested previously thru Annemarie building # 2 and at check-in was told, 鈥測es, your request is in the system but that does not guarantee and since we are at 100% occupancy today it is unavailable.鈥?I was surprised at this, since we really should have had this room 2 days ago. (I was told occupancy was dropping to 75% on Sunday)We鈥檙e told 鈥渘ow we can put you in building #3 for 1 hour, then move you to building # 1 and tomorrow put you in building # 2. Janet at check-in was very warm, friendly, and apologetic during this ordeal. I said, we鈥檒l go get something to eat and come back in an hour. In 1 hour, room still not ready and told to wait 30 min. longer. I asked to speak to 鈥淰ictor鈥?the front desk manager who has posted on TA but was told he is busy processing a new employee. Shouldn鈥檛 guests be his first priority??? After more waiting, Janet informs us someone vacated a room in building # 2 and they are getting it ready. I attempted to introduce myself to Annemarie at this time but she was off for the next 2 days. Apparently, building and room requests are honored if it happens to be available at check-in. Room requests are honored more efficiently at other hotels.You are given, room keys, towel cards and a little booklet of hotel information. (we had to wait several days to get this booklet in English as they had run out) I proceed to make reservations at the 2 restaurants requiring this, the Japanese and LeGormet. RoomJanet escorts us to room 2214, building # 2, 2nd floor. The standard room is the largest at any AI we鈥檝e been to. It had 2 double beds, and an extended sitting area with a leather couch, table, desk, and chair and enough space to also put in an extra bed. The bathroom situation which I鈥檝e read about is a minor inconvenience. One wrote if with kids, get a bathroom with a door, however all rooms have this situation. When you enter the room, the bathroom is on the right, without a door. There is a big double sink, a toilet behind a frosted 戮 length door, a huge marble shower behind another frosted 戮 length door, and a Jacuzzi bathtub. The bathtub is not enclosed. We got changed either in the huge shower or in the entranceway. Some people wrote about lack of washcloths, to us it is no big deal. However, you can just call housekeeping and they will bring you some. You鈥檒l probably need more pillows also, as they are flat.The room has a hairdryer, iron, free safe, bathrobes (nice touch!) and tiny tubes (1-2 usages each) of shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner. In the entranceway are closets and the minibar stocked with water, soda, and 2 beers. We also got champagne and chocolate bars. There is a nice size patio with 2 chairs and a table. Building # 2 鈥?most desirable because ALL rooms face the pool and you are closest to the buffet. There are 4 floors (elevators), and on the 1st floor you reach the pool via 4 bridges. The first floor rooms all have access to the pool via the patio and they have 2 comfy lounge chairs. These rooms have king size beds and I was told 鈥渘ot for families鈥?although I did see some families with younger kids in them.Building # 1 鈥?adjacent to building # 2 and actually the beginning and ending rooms of each of these building are steps across from each other. In the middle of the buildings is a fountain. Rooms in this building face the Grand Paradise hotel next door.Building # 3 faces the spa and pool.Building # 4 faces the construction side of the new Majestic Elegance hotel.Loss of PowerThis did happen on several days, each outage only lasting 5-10 minutes.Pool1200鈥?feet long, running alongside the entire length of building # 2. Plenty of lounges available with shade. (at other hotels, you have to wake up at the crack of dawn to 鈥渞eserve鈥?chairs 鈥?not the case here) It is huge, even at full occupancy you had plenty of room in the pool to yourself. Bring floats 鈥?the water activities hut will blow them up for you. I was also there at the time of the floating feces, not the hotel fault, just a disgusting guest. Maintenance came quickly and used a net to retrieve it. When I questioned Annemarie about adding chemicals, I was told it would be done thru the filter. Maybe the guests who witnessed this would have felt more comfortable, if this section of the pool was closed off for the day, but then again, that would have brought more attention to that matter. The pool did look very clean to us, although my daughter did come home with swimmer鈥檚 ear (this happened to her at another DR hotel). CleanlinessFrom dawn to dusk, housekeeping and maintenance are cleaning non-stop. In between the buildings are fountains and one morning, maintenance staff was in the water cleaning the dirt from the bottom. BeachA nice, long beach, plenty of lounges available with shade here also.Water was warm, with waves, and no seaweed.Water activities hut offered banana boat rides ($12 pp for 10 minutes, forgot that!), mini motor boats for 2 ($39 for 1 hr, more reasonable), parasailing, free into to scuba diving in the pool, windsurfing, bogie boards. Also here you can get beach towels.Entertainment 10:00 PM (should be earlier)Thursday 鈥?magic show (we missed this)Friday 鈥?men versus woman 鈥?typical AI show where teams have to gather bras, shoes, etc from the audience.Sat 鈥?typical AI singing and dancing show with the animation team performing as Britney Spears, Madonna, Usher.Sun 鈥?Michael Jackson show 鈥?an outside company performs an excellent theatrical show with great break dancers...Mon 鈥?typical AI 鈥渋deal couple鈥?show doing wacky stunts.Tues 鈥?circus 鈥?an outside company doing a 40 min. entertaining show Wed 鈥?beach party from 7-11, cancelled due to late afternoon rain.Friendliness and Helpfulness of StaffI would say 90% of the staff would smile and greet you with an hola, upon passing. One standout is Janet at the front desk. My son and husband wanted to watch the U.S. Open Tennis matches on TV. The TV is via satellite, so she put in this request and shortly called our room to advise what channel it would be on.DrinksAs my husband noticed a bottle of Gray Goose, he attempted to order this. I forgot to tell him that brand is not for 鈥渟tandard guests.鈥?We all enjoyed the 4 frozen drinks available at most of the bars: Majestic Pina colada Bahama mama Coco locoand the dirty monkey. FoodVery typical of all other all-inclusive hotels we鈥檝e been too, actually, but here I would rate it higher overall. All four of us ate everything and none of us got sick.I find it incredulous that people would have complaints in this area. At the buffets, there was absolutely nothing lacking in variety! At all the restaurants not everything will be to your liking, so no big deal, get something else. Don鈥檛 expect American type cakes, but again, you鈥檒l find something you鈥檒l like. I found a delicious brown coconut pudding (at lunch time, find it in a glass jar).Some complaints are the sodas are warm and flat. That is true, in some restaurants.The buffet and 3 a la carte restaurants located in the lower lobby are air conditioned 鈥?a nice feature not found at other AI鈥檚 !!Breakfast 鈥?crepe station with an entertaining crepe maker, omelet station in addition to pre-made hard-boiled, Spanish omelets, sunny side up eggs, bacon, sausage, cereals, potatoes, fruits, meats, veggies, cheeses, waffles, pancakes, thick french toast (my favorite), muffins, croissants, Danish (some better than others), juices. Our only complaint here were the banana milk smoothies 鈥?they were too watered down! Lunch 鈥?at buffet (more selection) or beach restaurant (less selection and no pizza)Yes, at the buffet there is a door guard and if your bathing suit is wet, you cannot enter.Various pizza (plain, with chicken, mushrooms  artichokes, ham), grill items (burgers, chicken burgers, hot dogs, shs-k-bob), pasta station (3 types, 4 sauces, add-in veggies), finger sandwiches, 5 types of salads, wraps, carved lamb, beef, fish, lasagna, potatoes, cooked veggies, fajitas, paella, 4 ice cream flavors with toppings, various desserts. On our last day, I found delicious potato pancakes (near the burgers). Dinner 鈥?the buffet had a similar selection as lunch. Some AI鈥檚 have theme nights, but not here. We ate a different a la carte restaurant nightly. Some AI鈥檚 you can only eat in a limited number, NOT the case here. You do need reservations for the Japanese and Le Gourmet.Le Gourmet 鈥?(reservations needed, long pants and closed shoes for men, children over age 12). We did see men with sneakers and sandals. Food and service were great. We had the steak while my kids enjoyed the chicken wrapped with mashed potatoes. The 鈥渕artini鈥?appetizer of cottage cheese and avocado looked better than it tasted.Note: the beach front restaurant serves lunch, and then at dinner, the left side becomes the steak restaurant and the right side is the fish restaurant and you cannot order both surf and turf on one side.Rodeo Grill - we enjoyed the steak. My kids attempted to eat the ribs but they were too hard. Fish Restaurant 鈥?my husband was surprised to see lobster offered (additional charge at other AI鈥檚). The first night we each were served 3 grilled lobster halves, at another night, only 2, but both nights very tasty. Seafood bisque soup too salty but again, no problem, there is enough to eat, the avocado salad yummy.Mexican  Dominican Restaurant 鈥?my kids liked this the best. You order off the Mexican a la carte restaurant while enjoying the Dominican buffet selections (Dominican soup is delicious). This restaurant was just as good as any NY Mexican restaurant.Chinese 鈥?didn鈥檛 get a chance to eat here.Japanese 鈥?(reservation needed, long pants for men) you walk thru the Chinese to the Beni-hana hibachi tables which seats about 15 people. You are served a nice selection of sushi, veggie tempura, egg rolls, and the cook grills beef, chicken, and shrimp. A nice selection of deserts including friend ice cream. GUESTS 鈥?br/>This hotel seemed to have more Americans (than other AI鈥檚 we鈥檝e been to), followed by Canadians and Europeans (a handful of topless women). It also had many more young couples than families.For fellow guests - Please walk an extra step and throw out your cups 鈥?you don鈥檛 have personal maids to follow you around!Bugs, bugs, bugs:After 2 days in room 2214, we all had an abundance of bug bites. My daughter had 20 bites just on one leg. The room either had bed bugs or numerous mosquitoes and we had to change rooms. Janet at check-in changed us to room 2226, and advised a bellboy would be up to help us (no one arrived). When I did meet Annemarie and advised her of this and the check-in problems, she arranged for 2 complimentary 25 minute relaxing messages. I thought this was a nice gesture, although a bit odd I had to sign a letter from the general manager stating 鈥渂y signing this letter, the guest involved releases management from any further responsibility, liability or complaint.鈥?I asked Annemarie about the bug situation and was told the hotel will not spray occupied rooms because of the poison and because of the rain, there are more bugs. When I checked out the 2nd room, the housekeeper showed me the 鈥淩aid-like鈥?can she was going to use. At other AI鈥檚, we鈥檝e gotten notices that the rooms and grounds were fumigated routinely and here this was the worst bug encounter. Also at the theatre, there were mosquitoes everywhere. We had brought bug spray but still got more bites at the theatre.ShoppingOpposite the theatre are about 8 shops 鈥?clothing, mini-mart (why would people buy bottled water here?), pool toys, souvenirs, etc. Also if you walk out the main entrance, pass the tennis courts, and thru the guard gate, immediately on the right you will enter a shopping area of 20+ vendor shops, all selling similar merchandise. Be prepared to offer a lot less than what they ask. TennisPart of my family鈥檚 vacation is playing tennis. This is where the hotel is lacking. Although there are 3 courts, they are in sad shape. The 2 hard courts do not have smooth surfaces; they have bumps and crevices, and lacking some lines. The clay court is no better. Walter, the 鈥減ro,鈥?although nice and the price was right ($10 hr) was no match for my 17 yr old son. We took a 10 minute walk via the beach to the Grand Paradise next door. Here we found 4 hard courts in excellent shape with a more experienced pro ($20 hr). Check OutCheck out is at noon. Our flight was at 3:00pm, and pick up was sched. for 12:20. However, when I learned that lunch begins at 12:30, I changed the pick up to 12:45. Although they don鈥檛 seem to mention this, I did happen to notice in the bathrooms adjacent to the check-in desk, are showers so if you have a later flight, utilize this room to shower and change.I said good-bye to Janet and she said wait one minute I have something to give you. (a Majestic remembrance perhaps, as we flashed back to our departure from Sunscape Casa del Mar where were given t-shirts and a beach bag). Not quite as we were given a piece of paper requesting us to write our comments on Trip Advisor ! Little did they know, I am a TA junkie !Suggestions:1. Combat the bug and mosquito problems and spray the rooms and the grounds.2. For families, the availability of a moving partition which would cover the bathtub, to give the bathroom privacy.3. To honor room requests better. If I took the time to research which building I wanted, this should be 鈥渉eld鈥?in the system for me and not given away.4. Start the shows at 9:00PM or 9:30PM, 10:00 is much too late for families with kids.5. As another TA wrote, and I realized she was absolutely right, there are no activities geared towards the kids. Several games at the pool and beach should be specifically for them. 6. Service is lacking at both Rodeo Grill and Fish Restaurant. We didn鈥檛 like the fact you are served the soup and appetizer at the same time and before any dirty dishes removed, they bring over the main course, never returning to check that everything is ok. 7. Increase the size of the shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner tubes. Each tube only lasts 2 times.8. Don鈥檛 water down the breakfast smoothies, especially the banana milk.9. Re-surface the tennis courts and have a professional tennis instructor on-hand.10. Have drink menus available at the bars (although it is easier for the bartenders if guests just order usual fare).11. Have pizza available at lunch at the beach buffet (it only comes out at 3:30 and it was cold)12. Fix the problem of some of the sodas being flat and warm.13. Install ceiling fans in the theatre and main lobby 鈥?very hot in both places.14. Provide something special for Trip Advisors. At the Sunscape Casa del Mar in La Romana, DR, I truly felt I was a VIP guest from beginning to end of my vacation. There TA readers are considered a 鈥渇orum friend鈥?and given fruit platters upon arrival, a special dinner on the beach with guest relations personnel and fellow Trip Advisors, and t-shirts and beach bags. 15. Washers and dryers for guests. Some AI hotels provide this for a nominal charge and since we now have weight limits on luggage this would really be great, especially for families. Majestic does have laundry service, however each shirt or shorts costs $4.00 each, so forget that.Conclusion:When you鈥檝e been to other AI hotels, you realize there are so many positive aspects here:1. beautiful hotel, friendly staff, outstanding pool, wonderful beach, great food;2. don鈥檛 have to wake up early to make dinner reservations or reserve beach and pool loungers;3. don鈥檛 need to wait for trams, everything is a short walk;4. can eat in a la carte restaurants more than once and only reservations and 鈥渄ress code鈥?for 2 of them;5. buffet and 4 restaurants are air conditioned;6. pool is so large even at 100% occupancy never seems crowded;7. standard rooms are large with extra sitting area; 8. no annoying vendors or timeshare people at the hotel or beach;9. the hotel is only 3 yrs old so furnishings are still nice.

<Content>Majestic is the right name for this hotel! Yesterday, my family and I (including two daughters aged 14 and 6) reluctantly returned to England after two amazing weeks at the Majestic Colonial hotel (August 19th-September 2nd). I am a frequent business traveller (2-3 times per month) and therefore am more than used to travelling around the world and staying in hotels - so I have high standards, but I am also very reasonable and realistic in my expectations of hotel standards and customer service. In addition, I have regularly visited the Caribbean islands of Barbados, Jamaica, Antigua, Cuba and the Dominican Republic with my family for my annual vacation. Dominican Republic has been our island of choice for the past 3 years in a row for value for money, lovely hotels, lovely people and convenience (direct flights from UK). In 2006 we stayed at the Ocean Blue in Punta Cana (loved it), in 2007 the Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus in Bayahibe (liked it but not as much as the Ocean Blue, the pool was a big disappointment - quite shabby), and in 2008 the look of the amazing pool at the Majestic Colonial meant that rather than return to the Ocean Blue, which had been the original plan, we would try the Majestic. We were not disappointed!!Check InUpon check in, we were greeted with the Majestic Cocktails and Majestic Cookies and given our wrist bands. I noticed throughout the stay that the wristbands for adults were different colours - ours were cream, others were red and others silver. I found out later after asking a friendly waiter that this was so the staff know where we are from - Cream = British, Silver = American/Canadian, Red = Spanish. Which would explain why we were often greeted in English rather than Spanish by staff, when others were greeted in Spanish. We were immediately taken by a bell boy to our two rooms - 1403 and 1404.RoomsWe had two standard suites with two double beds in each. I was initially a little disappointed because I had hoped that my room would have a King size bed. The hotel was fully booked but offered to change the rooms in two days so that we could have a king size bed when quite a few people were scheduled to leave. In the meantime, a maid arrived immediately to push the two beds together and remake the beds so that the sheets and matresses held them together - voila - one 9ft bed!!!! We liked the 9ft bed so much we didn't bother changing after the two days!! The bedroom was very well furnished with lots of added touches to make the stay comfortable including two white towel robes and slippers, iron and ironing board, free to use electronic safe, free minibar which was stocked up daily with a bottle of house champagne (not actually champagne, but French, sparkling and quite drinkable!), two Presidente beers, Pepsi, 7UP and the local version of Orange Fanta, Red Rock Naranja, plus of course bottled water. It's not mineral water, but purified local water called Alaska - which is to be expected. There was a coffee machine, colour TV with the usual US channels - CNN, ABC, Starz (great for films), BBC America for us Brits and also German, Spanish and Italian stations. The bathroom was great - a big jacuzzi and fantastic walk in shower which could easily fit more than one person and double sink. The bathroom is part of the room with the jacuzzi bath forming the division between the bed and the bathroom and the toilet is separate but has an opaque glass door which does not meet the floor or ceiling - so if you are sharing with someone who you would really rather couldn't see or hear you on the toilet - then this might cause a challenge!! The room also offered room service, but as we were in a standard room, there was a cost to receive room service. Other higher rated rooms included free room service. PoolOh my God.... the pool at this hotel is the best ever!! I just can't find fault with it at all. It is huge - and is split into two areas - a quieter area for people who don't want to be involved in the games and activities, and then the part where the activities take place. A very small kids pool is also in the 'busy' section along with a swim up bar. The pool is not deep - only about 110cm deep, so my 6 year old daughter could stand up easily in any part of the pool without worry. The number of sun beds and shady parasols were also just right. As a result, I didn't see any of the mad scramble to put down beach towels at 6am to secure a good spot that often happens at other hotels,. Everywhere was good! The quiet pool also has a jacuzzi area which is just by the bar (not swim up). The bar by the jacuzzi closed just a few days into our holiday, I guess because the hotel got quieter as we were coming close to September and the end of the school holiday season. So as a result, we had waitress service by the pool instead, even better. By the end of my stay, the waitress didn't even need to ask what I wanted, at regular intervals, our drinks would just appear!!! She was amazing..... I just wish I could remember her name! The pool was very clean compared to other pools, I saw no debris at all - no leaves, no dead insects etc the entire time I was there. Majestic Kids ClubA big hello to Angelica, Massiel and Pablo - our friends at the Kids Club. They are a credit to this hotel - especially Angelica, if I could take her home to be my daughter's Nanny I absolutely would! My 6 year old daughter absolutely loved her! This is the first hotel I have stayed at where Georgia begged to go to kids club every day. The facilities at the Kids Club are good - a small pool with two big slides, a manmade beach with sunloungers, widescreen TVs, pushbikes etc etc. The Kids Club had some renovation going on as Majestic is building a sister hotel, the Majestic Elegance, right next door which directly impacted the Kids Club, but apart from it being not as pretty to look at as it normally would be, it was business as usual!!RestaurantsThere are 7 restaurants at this hotel - two of them require reservations, the rest are walk ins. Buffet Restaurants Portofino  SupremeThis is classed as two restaurants - but the reality is it is one huge buffet with two seating areas. We ate breakfast here every day. The buffet is indoors and airconditioned - which is a bonus as I have stayed in many Caribbean resorts where the buffets are in areas with no windows or doors. This means that you can eat in comfort without being too hot and also that there are less 'wildlife' with you - no birds flying around your head, and hardly any insects etc. The buffet had everything - omelettes, eggs and pancakes cooked fresh to order, fresh bread, ham and cheese, fresh fruit, donuts, cakes, muffins, waffles, Bacon, Sausage and other local foods. Fresh fruit smoothies were made to order and champagne was available for those wanting champagne and orange juice. The coffee was regularly kept topped up by waiting staff, with fruit and herbal teas and hot chocolate also readily available. I often read on Trip Advisor about people getting stomach upsets. I did too - but quickly realised that it wasn't down to poor food preparation but more likely my inability to process the combinations of food that I was eating - especially eggs. As soon as I stopped eating little bits of everything from the buffet, and also stopped eating the omelettes (tough as they were yummy!) my stomach settled back down. When I looked at the combinations of food others around me were eating I did wonder if other people's stomach complaints were also 'self inflicted' without realising!Restaurante Taino - Mexican.This was my least favourite restaurant. The food was OK but wasn't as good as the Mexican at the Iberostar had been the year before. But we ran into an old friend, one of our waiters remembered us from the Iberostar where he had also worked when we had been there in 2007 - very small world, and how lovely that he remembered us and went out of his way to smile and say Hello!Restaurante Matsuri - Tepinyaki/ChineseThe tepinyaki part of this restaurant requires reservations and is in demand as it can only sit 12 on each of the two tables - but the wait is worth it, the food is great and the atmosphere is so much fun! We went 3 times, each time was better than the time before. The food was great and the 'performance' from the chefs were amazing. It's also a great way to meet and chat with fellow holiday makers, as it is virtually impossible to not talk to your neighbours unless you don't speak their language! My 6 year old daughter actually wanted to eat the shrimp (prawns) and realised that she really liked them - I could never get her to eat it before! The Matsuri also has a sit down chinese section which does not require a reservation.Restautante Le Gourmet - FrenchThis restaurant does not allow children under 12 years old and also requires a reservation, so my husband and I went there for just one night. The food is very good and the wine list is wonderful with a sommelier there to help with recommending and tasting a wine if you need help. The wine here is chosen from a wine list and is not included in the All Inclusive fee. So we chose a lovely Louis Latour Chablis for USD37 which was added to our checkout bill. Restaurant Steak House 'Rodeo Grill'  Seafood Restautant 'Tres Carabelas' The Beach Buffet Restaurant changes at night into two restaurants - the steak house and the seafood restaurant. As it's also the beach restaurant, this is the only restaurant that is 'outside' and therefore not airconditioned. We didn't try the seafood as my husband and kids are not fish eaters. The steak restaurant was good - I had a lovely sirloin steak twice and the chicken once. My chicken was very overcooked, but I know that my children's chicken was very nicely cooked each time they ordered it - so I guess I was unlucky.Garden Coffee BarIf you just want a simple breakfast, rather than go to the buffet - self service coffee, orange juice and croissants are available opposite the buffet by the pool. In the evening, the garden coffee bar turns into a bar and a band plays with dancing. Onsite Doctor/PharmacyThis was the first year that we didn't need treatment for ear infections - so I can't comment on the quality of the 24 hour onsite doctor (hurrah) but there is an onsite pharmacy where my husband was able to purchase painkillers for a headache. ShoppingThere are a number of shops at the hotel. The checkin reception area held the cigar shop and the Caribbean jewellers, Harrisons. Outside there was a number of additional shops - a Mini market selling postcards, sweets and crisps (very expensive - USD13 for a packet of sweets and a big bag of crisps), plus toiletries and suncream, rum, Majestic branded tshirts etc. Other shops sold clothing including bags and tshirts branded Gucci, RalphLauren, Lacoste, Chanel etc (although they clearly were not), costume jewellery, local paintings etc. PhotographersTropical Photographers are the onsite photographers and have photographers roaming the grounds permanently offering to take pictures. Sometimes with animals from the local zoo - monkey, iguana, smake, parrots etc. They can also be booked for private photo sessions. The photographers are very good and after a little bit of negotiation over the price when you go to collect the pictures, not hugely expensive. The standard price per printed photo is USD12, USD10 or USD8 each depending on the size of picture. But if you buy a few - you can always negotiate - we did and were very happy with the final price. One word of caution - they do not accept credit cards, so be prepared to pay in USD or visit the ATM in reception to withdrawn Dominican Pesos to pay.GymI used the gym twice and felt very virtuous when I first arrived, but then the pull of the buffet and the bar became too strong!!! The gym had all the usual equipment and has someone around to help with how to use the machinery if you need assistance. SPAI didn't use the spa, but it looked beautiful and very well equipped using Mary Cohr products. When we were there the SPA was offering 15% of treatments. Animation/EntertainmentFor some reason, I always end up falling asleep at some ridiculously early hour when I go on holiday - I think I get too relaxed. As a result, I only saw one show - which was entertaining - if you are thinking 'Broadway Musical' you will be disappointed, but if you think 'local amateur dramatics - lots of enthusiasm but not always matched by talent' you will enjoy it for nothing else than laughing at them. My daughters actually saw more than we did as they were desperate to see the magic show but my husband and I were too tired - so they went without us. It was so nice to know that they could go and be fine, no worries about safety. The shows all started at 10pm which is a bit late in my opinion - 9pm would have been better as I might have gone to more and also the children wouldn't find it too late to watch too.WeddingsThere are two places where couples can get married - the 'Tronera Bodas' which is a small outside pavilion for weddings and also a small onsite chapel which also takes Catholic Mass on Saturday evenings at 1830.Well, what more can I say. This place is great - simple as that. They are building the new Elegance right next door and therefore some people will have views of the building site (luckily we didn't, we overlooked the hotel on the other side of the Colonial) - the Elegance sounds like it is going to be even better than the Colonial with extra touches of luxury being added. However, the Colonial delivered everything we needed and more. The staff do speak English, some better than others - but they do want you to speak to them in at least a little bit of Spanish - which is fair enough in my opinion! You don't need much to get by....1) Ola - Hello2) Adios - Goodbye3) Por Favor - Please4) Gracias - Thank You5) c贸mo est谩 - How are you?6) Muy Bien - Very well7) Excellente - Excellent8) Con - With9) Sin - Without10) Cerveza - BeerThat's it - ten words that pretty much got us everything we wanted, together with a big smile and a response that was usually in English from the staff but you could see they really appreciated us at least trying, and laughed when they tried to get us to say more in Spanish and our faces went blank!!Do I have any recommendations for future visitors - yes, make sure you have enough USDollars - especially if travelling from Europe. If you want to purchase anything in the shops - photos, more suncream, postcards etc, the shops will want you to pay in USD notes and will be very reluctant to take your credit card for the transaction especially if it's not for lots of $$$$. The photographers won't take credit cards at all, plus you will need USD30 cash each to enter and leave the country. On one occasion when I needed to get more money from the ATM it had run out of cash and as it was a Saturday, it would not be restocked until Monday. Reception did try to help but the best suggestion they came up with was to ring another hotel and make arrangements for us to go to the hotel and visit their onsite bank, which we decided wasn't necessary and we simply waited until the ATM was restocked - luckily our purchase wasn't urgent.Will I go back to the Majestic - absolutely!!!! The staff at this hotel work very hard and I know for a fact that management watches them closely - on a couple of occasions, I saw them being lined up and given their orders and even reprimands, the staff certainly looked like they had to work hard - everything was very efficient and quick for a Caribbean resort...... The hotel deserves it's 5 star hotel rating and it deserves a 5 star Trip Advisor rating too!!!!Enjoy!

<Content>Wonderful Time We were there from August 21-August 29.Very nice hotel for any ages, my daughter had a lot fun.Very big rooms and beach is very good. People are very friendly.Be aware to stay in the Building #4, this building is facing to new construction and a lot of noise and dust. We had this problem, but thank you to Orlando from front desk; he helped us with this issue. We all had a blast; I can highly recommend this hotel! Food was not too bad.

<Content>Still Beautiful This was my second visit to the Majestic. My first was two years ago. This resort is absolutely gorgeous and it might very well be one of the prettiest resorts on the entire island. The food is OK, but not great. Breakfast was by far my favorite meal. My husband is an extremely picky eater and he always found something to eat. As far as the food is concerned, I've always wondered why they don't have a restaurant that is dedicated to just serving Dominican food. The Taino restaurant for some odd reason had a Dominican buffet, but serves mexican food off of the menu. The Mexican food is not very good. In my opinion, they should stick to good old fashioned Dominican cooking at the Taino restaurant b/c I'm sure that many people would love to experience a typical dominican meal.There were a couple of things that I found had changed from my last visit. During my first visit, the frozen drinks were actually frozen. This time around the drinks were watery as they came out of the machines and the bartenders added crushed ice. Not a big deal for me, but if you a big fan of frozen drinks, you will be disappointed. Also, the power went out at least once every day, once again, this wasn't a big deal for me but I do remember that during my first trip the we never lost power (maybe it has something to do with the resort being at full capacity). If all you care about is relaxing and enjoying the beautiful surroundings, then this is the resort for you.

<Content>Majestic - Fantastic! I just came back from Majestic last Sat and would like to share my view. I emailed Anne Marie before departure and was very pleased with her room assignment. The rooms are big, with 3 beds and a sofa, there are still lots of room to move around; the toilet is small but the shower can fit all 4 of us, both with doors, no privacy problem. The breakfast/lunch buffet at Supreme is good, the seafood and the steak by the beach are good too, we also like the pasta lunch cook to order by the beach; the chef at the Teppanyaki table is entertaining, he invited us for food/egg tossing games; but the Chinese food is unacceptable; as of Le Gourmet, we were disappointed. The waiter mistakely served our dishes to the other table, the dishes was sent back to the kitchen then back to us, we asked if they were same dishes that been sitted in the other table, he honestly said yes, so we rejected them and asked for new dishes, 5 min later, he served us 2 dishes that had different layout, we asked if they were made fresh, he said yes, he even showed with his gestures that the other dishes went to trash, so we gladly took it, but when I cut my Chateaubriand (supposingly medium rare), I knew it was the same one, it was fully cooked, the steak was just reheated. We called the waiter back and show him, he couldn't say anything, so we just left, a lady and then a man came out and asked what happened, we told them the story, we told them we didn't trust them and would eat elsewhere. We didn't want to see the waiter in trouble but let them know way to improve. Only 2 of our group of 8 had stomach issues once or twice.There are many acitivities you can joined during the day, we joined the water aeorbics, scuba lesson, dance lesson, kids disco and watched the beer drinking contest. We also watched all the 10pm shows, all are entertaining especially the magic show, the Ideal Couple and the Men vs Ladies. The MC wasamazing and a joy to watch him dance! I also wanted to mention Angelica in the kid club, she is energetic and nice to the kids. The first time we went in to the kid club, the water running down the slides was already shut off, but Angelica was willing to turn it back on and let the kids had a few slides before closing. One nite we wanted to check out the kids disco, we met Angelica outside the shop, she told us she would be there in a few minutes, we walked to the club, a young lady and a man told us the disco was finished, but it was only 8:45pm (supposed to start at 8:30pm)! The kids were disappointed and when we walked to the gate, Angelica came back and escorted us back in and asked the young lady to turn on the music and screen and showed us the dances. Another time we went back to learn the majestic dance, Pablo was there to show us step by step patiently, so when the kids were on the stage supporting the ladies on the show, they were able to join in the dance, and that was the best part according to them!Probably because of the rain, 6 of us got lots of mosquito bites that 3 couldn't sleep without taking the benedryl for a couple of nites, we used the bug spray but didn't seem to work.We don't drink much back home, but we liked the majestic drink, the coco loco, hola hola (by Im??? at the wet bar), the blue one and the banana mama at the lobby. The bloody Mary was water down and the virgin strawberry daquiri and the pina colada for the kids were too sweet, the fresh fruit drink/milk shakes at supreme were good!The market vendors were only at the resort for one day, after the show, the kids spotted a monkey carved out of coconut @$10, because he was packing away, he sold me the remaining 3 for $25. I am glad I bought them as a similar one in the airport costs $20 each. My friend bought a silver bangle (plus a freebie) for $15 that was originally asked for $40. Bargain!Overall, the beach, the pool, the resort, the staffs are fantastic, like many others have mentioned. We all have a great times and the kids are asking to go back, and I already recommend the resort to a few friends, I think it worth the money!,

<Content>nice holiday! My daughter (7) and I just got back from the Majestic and we had a wonderful time!- I had read some reviews of the hotel that were so bad that I was a little scared to go and thought that I may have made a mistake booking there- fortunately we experienced none of the problems others had - such as food poisoning, giant cockroaches, etc.  We went mainly to swim in the beautiful ocean and pool- both were amazing! The beach was gorgeous and the surf was not too rough for my daughter to swim in and the sand is soft and perfect for building castles and digging. I also loved that the pool is 4ft deep throughout and is so long and winding -there were always areas for kids to jump and swim around without bothering anyone- there is also a section for volleyball and a swim up bar....  In my opinion the pool really was the best part of the hotel - it is warm - which I don't mind - and it was also kept so clean.  We were given rafts our first day from departing guests and I would highly recommend bringing your own rafts, sand toys - plastic pails and shovels - the gift shop is unbelievably expensive - a little set of beach toys (like the kind at a dollar store) was $25 US - there wasn't a price tag on it but that is what the woman at the counter told me .. (sunscreen was also $20 - which we did have to buy....so bring plenty of that too)  The rooms were clean and ours was always well stocked with towels and the fridge was restocked every morning. Mosquitoes there are smaller , faster , smarter - bring spray! It doesn't seem to last long - The hotel will spray your room at night - if you need fumigation call the front desk . I had our room sprayed once- It worked but smells awful afterward and you can't exactly air it out or the mossies will come back.... -We tried a few of the restaurants and had nice meals and very attentive service- The grilled snapper was delicious and so was the chattaubriand (sp?) at the steakhouse....The breakfast buffet was perfect for my daughter - pancakes, bacon , fresh fruit, - plenty of variety and they replenished the buffet frequently-We tried the teppanyaki (sp?) restaurant - we had to make a reservation for this and had one time to choose from for the entire week we were there- it was OK - we are from Toronto and so have some favourite Japanese restaurants here.... I wouldn't have bothered to make a week in advance reservation for this restaurant again- the other restaurants are better - especially the outdoor restaurants by the beach. After visiting there I would recommend:-definitely bring mosquito repellent, sunscreen, raft and beach toys if you have kids- flashlight - the beach is really dark at night - also there were power outages almost every day - at night it can be scary for kids when the lights go out as the room gets pitch dark instantly - the outages didn't last long when we were there - ***pillows- this may sound silly but - I have to say the pillows at the Majestic were the absolute worst pillows I have ever slept on- if you want to get a good night sleep bring a pillow -Have a great time!!!

<Content>Great Entertainment Me and my fiancee has taken a vacation in August every year for the past 3 years and we had a great time at the Majestic Hotel. The hotel was excellent and the entertainment was 5 star. We would like to thank Henry aka(BA-BA) and his OUTSTANDING CREW. Aris-Ive-Nina-Jesus-Melvin-Francisco. They made sure that you participated in all of the events with the main goal being you having FUN and LAUGHING. The entertainment crew made sure that you was comfortable whenever they passed you within the hotel. They made sure that you knew the time and place of all activities. So once again I would like to thank Henry and his crew for making my stay and future return well worth the money.Darryl SakaJamie Foxx

<Content>The Royalty of the Majestic Colonial We stayed at the Majestic Colonial for 7 days during the first week of August. This resort was simply AMAZING. As soon as we entered, we were greeted with friendly staff and free drinks( which was wonderful because of the heat) This 5 class hotel was the best choice we ever made. Everyone was so nice and the rooms were so beautiful!!! Marble floors, pillars, and an amazing view of the entire pool! There were different events happening every day, almost every hour! The beach was soooooo nice! The entertainment team at the Majestic were so energetic and became friends with most of the guests. We met Mosquito Man!!! He always said hi to us every time he saw us, and pulled us into all the activities and games! The grill house was right on the beach and had amazing steak and a great variety of fruit and cheese! The best part were the shows every night at 10. They would change everyday so no one would ever get bored. The shows were funny, full of action, and interactive. The main host always asked for applause and we remember this quite well,  Everybody clap your hands, PA PA PA PA PA!!!' and the music would go with his voice and it was SO COOL! Even now at home we start saying Pa pa pa. Hahaha, this experience was phenomenal and we won't forget this resort.

<Content>Very nice place, especially for the price I was more than a little leery after reading all the mixed reviews. I would have to say that some people apparently expect a luxury resort from an all inclusive in the Dominican Republic. If you are looking for perfection then pay for it in the USA. We were actually amazed at all the different nationalities that we met at the resort. Only a few Americans which was really unique.I was very impressed with the beauty of the place as soon as we pulled up. There are constantly people walking around cleaning, landscaping and making sure everything looks great. 90% of the people we dealt with spoke English very well or at least well enough to understood any of our needs. They take US dollars at all the places which made it even easier for us.The rooms were huge and very nice. The open design would be a bit odd for couples staying together or with teenagers. We were in a jr suite with a jacuzzi in the room and one on the porch. The toilet and shower are in their own little spaces. Not a lot of privacy. It was not a big issue for my wife and I. We could not have asked for cleaner rooms. The maids were just fine. We had a few bugs in our room (no cock roaches) but again it is the Dominican Republic. We have bugs in the US too. Give me a break.The pool and beach as others said are incredible. We enjoyed swimming in the ocean and the pool. The swim up bar and multiple other bars were an added bonus. The food... Again if you want perfection then stay in the USA and pay for it. This is an all inclusive that has to feed 1000 or more people. We ate at the Japanese place once. It and the Gourmet place require reservations. We were a tad disappointed that the menus did not change from day to day. The sushi was great and the other food was great as well. The Gourmet place. Ehh not that great. It was alright. The seafood place near the beach was our favorite. Great food and a lot of fun. The buffet near the beach was alright. A decent array of food to choose from. The buffet in the center of the hotel was amazing. I have not seen such an array of foods in a long time. If you could not find something to eat there you never will. The shows were ok. Entertaining for a while. We saw the Madonna show and the Michael Jackson one. We were told that the couples show was quite funny as well. They have a decent gym and casino. Again if you want a huge casino stay in the USA. It was a decent casino. The shops and such are reasonable. Except the cigar shop!!! DO NOT PAY THE RIDICULOUS PRICES IN THE CIGAR SHOP. I noted that for Cuban's or ANY other cigar the prices are literally 4-5 times retail cost. Not sure why but I was in shock. What a rip off.As I said to begin. If you want luxury and all gourmet food then you would be happier elsewhere. If you want a clean nice place to stay without braking the bank then go to the Majestic. We were very happy with the week we stayed there.

<Content>My experience at Majestic Colonial, from New Jersey We stayed at Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. When we arrived they had Majestic drinks waiting for us and it was so refreshing because it was really hot. I was a little bit disappointed because talking to other guests they got cold wet towels along with their drinks but i did not. They need to be more consistent with all their guests. The room was very elegant but i did not like the bathroom it was open and we had a child so there was no privacy so if you are travelling with children make sure you book a room that has bathroom doors if you have children. You might have to bring your own wash cloths too because none was provided in the room and it took 6 hours before i got them. They have seven restaurants, Huge pool, activities and lots more for you to do so you will never be bored. Be careful with your excursions, we went parasailing and paid $85 for two people and it lasted less than 10minutes. I was very upset because in the activity book it is listed for 1 hour. The drinks was very good and I took advantage of it to get my money's worth because I was not crazy about the food. Don't get me wrong they have seven restaurants one can choose from. The staff were very friendy but one night at the seafood restaurant one of the servers made me so mad because he would not listen to what we wanted to order for our drinks and then the other server spilled water all over the table I was very upset. I must say one employee that really stand out to me the most was Nina, she works on the animation team. She was always smiling and saying hello and adopted us as her family, she is a wonderful girl, go Nina and keep up the good work and I hope to see you sometime again in the future. Overall I had a great time and would recommend my friends and family to go there on their next vacation and of course Majestic Colonial, Punta Cana would see me again in the future.Reineen from New Jersey

<Content>Nothing To Brag About... We stayed at the Majestic from August 18th - August 26th and could not wait to return home. There is no doubt that the resort is beautiful in appearance, and after staying in Punta Cana last summer this resort had a lot to live up to in order to compete w/the Paradisus Palma Real. There is no doubt in my mind that Paradisus blows this place out of the water.I am just going to state the facts:1. There were too many uncontrollable children on the resort w/nothing to do. They were jumping from the overhead bridges into the pool, cartwheeling into the pool, and even leaping into the pool from the ledge of the whirlpool. The resort honestly needs to invest in a children's program and/or activities for children. I did notice that there is a castle being built, which looks like it is in the works for the children. Maybe that will improve this issue.2. On 2 separate dates we saw feces floating in the pool. YUCK!!! When I went to tell the staff of our discovery and suggest removal no one knew english. HHHHMMMMM...go figure?? The pool just became less  less clear day by day. I can honestly say I never saw anyone cleaning it or even skimming for debris at the bottom.3. ROACHES!!!!! Need I say more. Well, we saw a roach or 2 wiggle its' way in the room from under our doorway. We definitely killed the few we saw, but who knows what got past our eyes. Thus, it got to the point where I was stuffing a towel under the door in an attempt to keep them out. I even aired out our luggage on the balcony just to make sure we wouldn't have any company when we got home. Thank god we have no surprises at home thus far.4. Customer service was just inconsistent. You either found someone that was extremely helpful or someone who acted like you didn't exist. There were days where we weren't offered a drink at all while at the buffet. 5. LIQUOR...or lack there of??? The liquor in drinks must of been non existent and it definitely wasn't premium liquors. The only liquor that seemed to cause any buzz was Mama Juana of course  the house rum, Brugal. Other than that you were begging for a buzz. I must say the specialty drink The Majestic was quite tasty! 6. KUDOS. Please let me give credit where credit is due. Barone in the steak house is excellent!!! And Anne Marie Rauch is very helpful as well.I just feel that this resort has many quirks to work out as far as customer service, cleanliness, and general resort operations. I can honestly say we will not be back.

<Content>Loved it. Going back in 1 month Loved this hotel. Loved everything about it. I booked 2 ocean front rooms. For whatever reason 1 ocean front was not available and they upgraded us to a junior suite. Trust me no complaints here. We ordered room service everyday at no extra cost because it was included with the upgrade. The rooms were cleaned beautifully and the fridge was stocked daily. Whatever we needed was handled right away. The pool was the biggest that Ive seen in the carribean and very clean. The beach is beautiful. Had to go there everyday. What can i tell you about the people, from reception to entertainers to the cooks ,waiters and waitresses, and the cleaning team. everyone was very polite and cared about your needs. By the time I left I knew everyone by their first name. My favorites Entertainment - Martires, Jesus, Mosquito, John - Haiti, Nina, and Connie. Waiters - Elvis, Alberto, Galan. Cooks - Alexi Cleaning - Andrea and of course Reception Victor you guys are the best and thank you for making our trip unforgettable. Wait for us because we will definitely be back. Love u guys Maria Paulino, DeJanee Scott, and Maria Estevez from New York See you next year!!!!!!!

<Content>Friggin Loved This Resort!! This hotel was awesome. The rooms and activities were great and exciting. My family and I throughly enjoyed our 6 day vacation. The best part however was the Animation team they really worked hard to make our trip memorable. Specials are Walther, Conny, Jesus, Nina, Lio, and many many more!! They worked so diligently to prepare fun activities and shows for the guests enjoyment. I would definitely go back SOON!!!P.S. Diversity is great!!

<Content>Staff was EXCELLENT The staff was AMAZING!!! Maria Lorenzo in the Supreme restaurant was extremly helpful and courteous. We were a large group of 19 people and were well taken care of.Also, Walther (Moskito man) was so much fun. The stretch and aeorbics instructors are a lot of fun too. Especially Maria Teresa and Melvin. The staff go above and beyond. We have stayed in other inclusive resorts, this was the best. We would recommend this resort to other travelers.

<Content>Good Vacation I just came back from my stay at the Majestic Colonial and I am happy to say that my family and I enjoyed our vacation very much. The check in was quick and easy and the rooms are nice but are a little small. They are not made for four people even though they say they are. The pool is huge and was very nice. The beach was beautiful and was a great place to hang out all day. The buffets are above average for Punta Cana but the restaurants are really good. Our favorites were the Hibachi Restaurant and Steak House. The bars are really good but the frozen drinks are hardly ever frozen. They are only frozen at the bar behind the pool bar. The shows were ok. The best ones are the couples and circus shows. The animation staff is really good and always kept you entertained. All of them, Moskito, Henry, Melvin, Yan, Jesus, Mickey, and Nina, work extremely hard and always have you doing something. Beach volleyball is played there all day which was really cool and there are numerous games and tournaments played everyday. All in all, my family really enjoyed our vacation and reccommend it to everyone.

<Author>churrosCanada
<Content>Paradise from a realistic perspective! We just got back from the Majestic colonial after a one week stay I am writing this review because I feel that many previous posts are unrealistic and dramatic! People have booked and researched thier vacations and are departing questioning whether they have made a huge mistake and contemplating whether to cancel or switch to alternative accomodations as a result of some of the outrageous claims being posted!I am not saying that the Majestic is perfect and without room for improvement - but what resort in the caribbean (DR for that matter) is? We are very scrutinizing and picky (I am a self-proclaimed stickler) and proud of it and i am telling you that the Majestic is above average! The food selection /availability and freshness is good by caribbean standards. Breakfast in the main buffet is wonderful. The selection of freshly baked goods (where else do you have a chef baking croissants in front of you and making churros and donuts on a daily basis?) Where else will you get a chef making crepes? omelettes? eggs to your liking? champagne and orange juice? personal smoothies? and this is just breakfast! The Dominican coffee is wonderful - drink as much of it as you can because you will miss it when you're gone! Even more memorable are the cappuccinos (many people don't realize that you can order them in all the restaurants including the buffet!) Enjoy them because they are delicious! The a la carte restaurants are also decent - some better than others (but that is anywhere you go) Lets face it -there are many resorts that don't allow you unlimited a la cartes, nor do they allow you to just walk in and be seated at your convenience, like the Majestic. I have travelled all over the caribbean and despise being told I am only allowed a certain number of a la cartes and have to prereserve at times that aren't necessarily conducive to me. At the Majestic - whenever YOU are ready for dinner you show up painlessly at a restaurant and have your meal. That is what a stress free vacation should be about! The lobster at the Seafood restaurant is wonderful (which is why we enjoyed it a few times)! The Chateubriand at the Steakhouse is also quite good (we also enjoyed that a few times)! The Mexican is below average as is the Chinese! The best places for dinner are the Buffet (Large selection), the Steakhouse and the Seafood Restaurant .Another wonderful feature of the resort is that you do not have to wake up at the crack of dawn to race to claim sun loungers and palapas - there are many and you will find one if you show up at after breakfast.The service is average - you will find happy people and not so happy people doing their jobs. We didn't find that the staff worked better/worse dependant upon tipping. Tip those people who you hit it off with because they made your experience a little more special! The animation team is average - based on previous travels I really didn't feel that they made the vacation more memorable. They really need to revamp this team because a few seem to be working hard while others seem to be there for the wrong reasons (dead weight that anchor the whole group). The resort also needs to strengthen their kids club - while they have the facilities in place they do not have a strong animation team reaching out to the kids. On 3 evenings there was nobody working at the kids disco and the kids were sadly dissappointed. Upon probing we just got excuses and passing of the buck from the animation team.The general cleanliness of the resort is above average - although I will say that they need to strengthen their maintenace department - as there are many things in need of repair that seem to be let go. Sadly, if this continues this resort will look old really fast ( it is only 3 years old but looks older due to lack of upkeep).To be realistic, the Majestic is above average from DR standards - as I have stayed elsewhere twice in the DR I can confidently say that. Yet, you see that it has so much potential and caters to a clientele that does expect a lot - well travelled, educated and experienced - so one would like to see the Majestic reach its full potential. With stronger management and more attention to service this resort can/will meet its full potential. It is truly a diamond that needs to be polished so that one can truly appreciate its lustre.Do not hesitate to go to the Majestic - every person I met there had a positve, relaxing experience (many felt that it had exceeded their expectations). Go with an open mind and you will surely have a wonderful and relaxing vacation!

<Content>Beautiful Resort and Beach, Great Staff.... but.... Just returned yesterday from Punta Cana where my girlfriend and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial. The resort is Beautiful, especially at night when the pool is lit up and people are dressed up a bit. The staff is managed well, and structured well. I remembered we went to the outdoor seafood restaurant and noticed how EVERY plate was inspected before placed on a table by a manager... he would decide if it was good enough to put out. The food tasted fine. We went with AAA and VIP for the excursions and airport shuttle(premium members- I guess they can get discounts on exursions and all inclusive premium liquor). The buses were ontime to pick us up for airport and for the safari excursion that we did. no problems there. The excursion was with Bavaro Runners- a good excursion, except we felt that they rushed it a little at the sugar cane plantation. Also when we went to the school we werent allowed out of the bus and the kids tried to sell us hats and t shirts for 15 dollars that say bavaro runners on them (hmmm... seems like they tried to get more money out of us instead of letting us see how the schools really were... we were looking to interact with the kids and see the school, not get scammed or feel guilty about buying items). At the resort, one waiter remembered us throughout the whole trip, his name was Nelson. He spoke little English but always called us by name when we saw him.The Beach is beautiful, no complaints. *** The negative things, my girlfriend and I got a little sick from the food on Days 6 and 7 before we came home. Be careful of the food. We never touched the salad as recommended by the reviews, but still got sick. we spent one day in the room just sleeping, felt aches and pains, but were fine otherwise on the other days. Although, sometimes the food sickness can be confused with sun poisening... so bring lots of sunblock....Bring some food from home in case you get sick, it helps alot (saltines crackers, gold fish, gatorade, whatever). Another bad thing, if you do get sick, they dont give free imodium AD... it's 15 dollars!!! crazy!. They do have abundance of bottled water . dont drink the tap.Other things were, songs at resort were repetitive. We got sick of hearing songs being repeated. Overall, if you dont get sick, you will have a blast. I recommend no more than 5 days/nights at the resort.

<Author>MAZ-JMZ
<Content>P-E-R-F-E-C-T Vacation First of all, my Husband and I are in our early 60s and this was our first trip to Punta Cana, as well as our first time at an all-inclusive resort. We booked our trip (8/13 鈥?8/20) through Liberty Travel (Kimberly Scharf) in St. James, NY. We had direct non-stop flights on American Airlines from JFK.ARRIVAL: We arrived at the Majestic at approximately 4:00PM and were personally greeted with an icy cold Majestic and welcomed by Annemarie (who is a very sweet and lovely young lady) at the check-in counter. She made sure we made our dinner reservations at LeGourmet (French) and Matsuri (Teppanyaki) before she personally escorted us to our room (#2127) 鈥?(which was one of the four room choices we had originally requested). Upon entering our room, we found a Welcome Platter and a Bottle of Champagne on the table to welcome us. That personal touch made us feel special right from the start.ROOM: We were in a Majestic Junior Suite (which is a Ground Floor Swim-Out Suite) in Building #2 along the Swimming Pool, directly across the Pool from the Spa. Our room was in the middle of the resort (between the Lobby and the Beach) where it is quieter. This room category is Adults Only. Our room had a slightly musty odor (which is common in the Caribbean), but Lysol Spray took care of that in a very short time. The room was large and very clean. The air conditioning was very comfortable and the ceiling fan circulated the cool air throughout the room. We took the advice from prior TA Reports and brought two of our own flat rubber stoppers (for the jacuzzis) and an automatic night light (which we placed in the outlet by the sink). We also brought RAID Flying Insect Spray with us to spray our room each day for any mosquitoes that may have gotten into the room, but we never had a problem.ROOM SERVICE: They have a very limited menu, but on several occasions we found the Club Sandwiches for lunch while relaxing on our private terrace to be very good, along with a bottle of Presidente from our mini-bar, which was fully stocked daily.TAP WATER: Do NOT drink or use tap water to brush your teeth or to rinse your mouth or toothbrush. We used only Bottled Water and had NO problems. Be sure to keep your mouth closed and be careful not to swallow any water while showering.SUNSCREEN: We brought SPF-60, 45, 30 and 15 along with us. We both started with SPF-60 on the first day and got very little color. My husband (who is obviously smarter than me) continued to use SPF-60 throughout our entire stay and came home with a nice golden tan. I, on the other hand, thought I knew better, and decided to step down to SPF-45 on the second day and ended up burning rather badly on my chest and arms 鈥?sun blisters and all. Only you know how badly you will burn in a very strong sun 鈥?BE VERY CAREFUL.BEACH  OCEAN: The beach is absolutely gorgeous with soft white powdery sand. There were always plenty of palapas and lounges on the beach to relax in the shade. The ocean was always calm and crystal clear during our entire stay. The water temperature was very warm (at least 85 degrees).SWIMMING POOL: There were also plenty of palapas and lounges in the various areas around the Pool. The Pool was always very clean and warm (sometimes actually too warm and more like a bath). Be sure to bring your own Pool Float(s) with you to float around on as the resort does NOT provide them.BARSWET BAR (Swim-Up Bar): This bar is located near the Beach end of the Swimming Pool. They serve drinks on the Pool side (as a Swim-Up Bar) as well as on the Land side where they have several tables  chairs. Be sure to say 鈥淗OLA鈥?to Maximo at the Wet Bar (on the Swim-Up side). He is the one who is always smiling and saying 鈥淵EAH BABY鈥? Everyone seems to love him and when you meet him, you will definitely know why.BEACH BAR: This bar is located in the center of La Hispaniola which is located in the Palapa Hut on the Beach.LOBBY BAR: This bar is located in the lower Lobby and is a gathering place from 5:00PM 鈥?1:00AM. Whether it be a cocktail before dinner or a night cap after dinner, be sure to say 鈥淗OLA鈥?to Pedro and Alejandro, who are both a lot of fun and make great Dirty Monkeys and Mojitos.PIANO BAR: This bar is located in the upper Lobby. They have live piano music in the evening. Be sure to say 鈥淗OLA鈥?to Roberto. He is also a great guy.PLAZA BAR: This bar is located outside in front of the Buffet Supreme. They have live music in the evening with plenty of tables to sit at while relaxing with your favorite beverage.CASINO: The casino is small, but not too small to have a little fun in after dinner. There are 3 or 4 tables and about 20 鈥?25 slot machines ($.01 - $.05 - $.25). The casino also has a small bar to the left as you enter.RESTAURANTSBUFFET SUPREME: This restaurant is located adjacent to the lower Lobby. The only meal we ate at the Buffet was a huge breakfast each morning, which is my Husband鈥檚 favorite meal and which we both enjoyed very much. They had several different food stations: Omelettes 鈥?Fried Eggs 鈥?Waffles 鈥?Crepes 鈥?Pancakes 鈥?French Toast 鈥?Mimosas 鈥?Fresh Fruit  Fruit Smoothies 鈥?Mini-Pastries. They also had a buffet table with bacon (the best I ever had), ham, sausage, etc. You will find practically anything you could possibly want at this buffet. The Chocolate Croissants are to die for.LA HISPANIOLA: This restaurant is located in the Palapa Hut on the Beach. It serves a continental breakfast in the late morning and lunch and afternoon snacks during the day. (In the evening, this restaurant becomes the Steak/Seafood Restaurant, which is separated by the Beach Bar, for dinner.) We ate lunch here a few times and found the Pasta Station to be the best choice. They had several different kinds of freshly cooked Pasta (cooked in front of you) along with 3 different Sauces (Tomato Sauce 鈥?Meat Sauce 鈥?Alfredo Sauce). I tried all 3 Sauces and they were all very good. My husband also had a Panini Sandwich one day for lunch and he liked it very much.LE GOURMET (French): This restaurant is located in the lower Lobby and is Adults Only. The food and service were both excellent. Entr茅e choices: Filet of Beef 鈥?Grouper 鈥?Red Snapper 鈥?Chicken. We both had the Filet of Beef which was very tender and very good. The only thing we did not care for was the spice used in the gravy served on top of the filet. It was a rather strong-tasting spice that was unfamiliar to us.MATSURI (Teppanyaki): This restaurant is located in the lower Lobby and has two separate rooms (each room seats 12 people) around a Teppanyaki grill. Entr茅e choices: Filet Mignon 鈥?Chicken 鈥?Salmon 鈥?Shrimp. Each person is allowed to choose 2 out of 4 choices. Since there were 2 of us, we ordered all 4 choices to share between us and each of us got to taste a little of everything. Our entr茅e was served with Fried Rice. Everything was superb and we also enjoyed the Teppanyaki Chef鈥檚 unique presentation.TRES CARABELAS (Seafood): This restaurant is located in the Palapa Hut on the Beach. A few small tables overlook the pool. Entr茅e choices: Grilled Lobster 鈥?Grouper 鈥?Red Snapper 鈥?Garlic Shrimp. We ate dinner here 3 times. We had Grilled Lobster 2 or 3 times and each time it was cooked to perfection 鈥?moist, tender and very tasty. My husband also had the Garlic Shrimp and he enjoyed that very much as well.RODEO STEAK HOUSE (Steak): This restaurant is also located in the Palapa Hut on the Beach. It is separated from Tres Carabelas (Seafood) by the Beach Bar. Entr茅e choices: Chateaubriand 鈥?Sirloin 鈥?Churrasco 鈥?Pork Chops 鈥?Brochette. We ate dinner here 2 times and each time we enjoyed the Chateaubriand with Bearnaise Sauce served on the side. Both times the Filet was very tender and juicy and cooked exactly the way we ordered it 鈥?MEDIUM RARE.LA BODEGUITA DEL MAJESTIC: This is a late-night Snack Bar and is open from 11:00PM 鈥?6:00AM. It is located on Caribbean Street near the Casino and Sports Bar. My husband had the Deep Fried Hot Wings and Nachos with Cheese several times and he enjoyed them both.CONCLUSION: We both had a wonderful and memorable vacation in Punta Cana and look forward to returning to the Majestic in the very near future. We found the resort to be very clean and beautiful, our accommodations to be very comfortable, the dining choices to be numerous and the food quality to be far more than acceptable (based on US (Northeast) standards). The Dominican people are extremely hard-working. Most of them work 16-hour days and as many as 12 consecutive days (or even more) before getting 2 or 3 days off. Some of them actually live at the resort and away from their families because it is too long a distance for them to commute on a daily basis. We found the Dominican people to be some of the friendliest and nicest class of people we have ever had the privilege or pleasure of meeting while on vacation. Instead of feeling like strangers in a foreign country (which is what we really were) 鈥?we always felt welcome and like we belonged because of the way the Dominican people reached out to us and welcomed us into their Country. Even though we did not speak their native (Spanish) language fluently 鈥?I am sure they knew that we were at least trying to communicate with them in their native language. I would highly recommend this resort to friends and family everywhere.Liked: EverythingDisliked: Nothing

<Content>Great Trip.. has a feww issues Myself  husband (30  40) just got back ... we stayed aug 16- 26/08, The good : Room was beautiful , beach was amazing, nitetime shows were good , some chessier than others, people were friendly , always a smileThe not so good: Food was pretty good but could be improved ie : kept hotter otherwise ok,(japanese was the best !) our room at first had a musty smell (ground floor ) we told the front desk  housekeeping did something  It went away, drinks were on the watery side (because it was so hot! but had plenty of rum...) we brought bubba cups with us  it was fine, night club def. for the younger crowd ie: 16-21 yrs old , but had other stuff going on like the shows or their band (Good!) , Had a great time, would recomend it if you are looking to have fun, 1 side note: yes they don't speak alot of english but enough to understand each other.. lean a few phrases it helps  remember .. you are going to their country .. try to learn their language.. it helps.

<Content>Tip the Towel Guy I would like to firt start off by saying please tip the towel guy.. He is the most kindest person and at the end of our trip we gave him $2 and his eyes light up.. I guess he gets overlooked.. Just the look on his face was priceless. The resort is amazing however the food is a problem. the food is displayed really nice but lacks the taste. The french restuarant had to wait an hour just to get our meal. The Japanese was great. The buffet was okay but they leave the doors open which brings flies inside - close the doors and leave them closed. The staff were all friendly and working non stop.. The rudest people were the ones in the Casino and the mini mart they need to get in touch with reality.. Beach was excellent the pool was superb. I would recommend this resort just for the layout and the pool it never seems likes it overcrowded.. Overall a great place but they need to work on the food quality.. We got sick when we came back. They also should have bottled water in thebuffet which we asked for but didnt have. It was a relaxing resort and we are happy -- oh 1 more thing its true the Americans (not all) were the most annoying people ever...

<Content>Completely disillusioned! This was our first time in Punta Cana and unfortunately the last. The quality of the food was not that of a 5 star resort, customer service was not an option and the cleanliness was less than impeccable for a 3 year old resort. The beach was beautiful but you can get that in other islands. Luckily I was there for a reason, my best friend's wedding!Completely disillusioned!New York

<Content>We Had Cock Roaches In Our Room Our room was infested with mosquitos and roaches and had an unpleasant odor. Management agreed to change our room, but we found even more roaches and mosquitos in the second room. My husbnad and I found ourselves killing bugs during our whole stay. Mangement offered us room service and I got a free manicure, but we would have rather had a bug free room. The resort only served one type of beer and the frozen mixed drinks were not good. Some of the staff were not friendly and very few spoke english. The pool was the best part of the trip.

<Content>Hear it is...the absolute truth about the Majestic Let me start by saying that we travel ALOT...  by that I mean 5-6 times a year and I have stayed at many fine hotels in the carribean, so I was a bit skeptical about the Majestic after reading some reviews. Honestly here's the downlow...1- As far as the hotel itself, I have stayed at much pricier hotels that weren't as esthetically beautiful and more importantly CLEAN! The place is immaculate  let no one else tell you otherwise, if they do they have no idea about what they are talking about and obviously are blind! 2- The rooms are quite large. I would even go as far as saying the largest standard rooms I have yet to see. I think they are all jr suites.The are very well kept and quite nice. As for the privacy issue, only if you have older children and are planning on taking bubble baths do I see an issue because the tub is not closed off, otherwise the open concept suits me fine ( I have a 4  2 year old) with me so I had no problems. The shower is large  towels were always readily available. No, the bed is not heavenly but I have slept on worse in carribean resorts. Do not think you will get the beds they have at the Bellagio in Vegas at an all inclusive in Dominican, I mean come on! 3- The beach and pool are the few things everybody agrees on and that is because they are GORGEOUS!!! I can't say more than seeing is believing.3- Here is the big one... FOOD. Admitedly not the best. Very comparable to other all inclusive resorts. I would like to know what people expect at a dominican resort? Do you expect to have Wolfgang Puck pop up and cook for you? I think not. When you have travelled, you know what to expect in an all inclusive. Want fine dining? pay for it  go to another island...try Aruba, Bahamas, Antigua.. but I garantee you the price won't be the same! You are in the dominican people accept it for what it is  you won't be dissapointed. Have I had better? YES, have I had worse? YES! 4- Service is extremely friendly. The language barriers though can get on your nerves. They (most of the employees) do not understand a word of english. That's what they should focus on, teaching their staff to speak basic english. Management needs to understand how important this is!! Had alot of difficulty communicating our needs, big downer. I must say though, that we are tippers, so I can't say for sure that this is why they were so nice to us cause I saw many people not tipping and they were just as nice. I'm sure it played a bit of a role in their attitude towards us but heck, my two kids are a handful  I gladly tip anyone that has to deal with them at mealtimes!5- Animation is probably as good as anywhere else I've been that does this sort of thing. They work hard and in this heat god bless the whole team for having that type of stamina! Listen is this what we consider a 5 star hotel? Probably not. I would definetly give this hotel a 4 star review because on the whole it is a very nice place to go relax and enjoy a week of sun. I would not return only because I never go to the same place twice (besides Vegas  Atlantis in Bahamas, who blames me right?) I saw alot of couples and I do believe that it could be quite romantic, assuming you don't bring your screaming kids with you like we did! Overall I was simply impressed and would definetly recommend this place. Don't listen to the naysayers, it is a good hotel at a good value. Even a really picky person cannot argue with that....I know cause I am a really picky person. Hope this helps you decide.

<Content>Managing your expectations is the key to good vacation at the Majestic My husband, our 10 year old daughter and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial August 16-23. We had a really relaxing vacation and I would recommend the hotel with a few caveats.First I would like to thank Anne Marie in Guest Services as I had emailed her in advance asking for a room in Building 2. When we arrived we had a lovely room overlooking the pool on the ground floor across from the spa. It was a perfect location and we enjoyed the ability to go out our sliding doors and jump into the pool.As most everyone has said the grounds, pool and beach are all very nice. There is no shortage of loungers or palapas for shade. I would even venture to say that there were too many loungers on the beach. As for the musty smell in the rooms people have complained of I would say it鈥檚 about the same as what you would find in most humid, tropical climates. I was at the Ritz Carlton in Key Biscayne Florida the week prior and it suffers from the same problem. I do think the hotel should do a little better job on upkeep and maintenance 鈥?painting, replacing grout etc. We found the staff to all be very friendly and helpful with one exception. The bartender at the swim up bar 鈥?Maximo had a serious attitude problem and as much as we tried to avoid him it was close to impossible as he was usually working there. The woman bartender was lovely. We found the front desk staff very friendly 鈥?especially Sofia who checked us in. One of the reasons we chose the Majestic was that it was billed as family friendly and advertised 2 kids club 鈥?one for 3-7 year olds and one for 8-14 year olds. The facilities at the kids鈥?club are very obviously for little kids and were not in the greatest state of repair. There were no separate activities that we could find for older kids and every time we went by there were only little kids. We spoke to several families with older kids and they were all disappointed in this. All of the animation that takes place at the pool and beach is adult oriented 鈥?it wouldn鈥檛 take much to have one or two activities a day designed to get older kids to meet each other at the pool and help make friends. The pool is also large enough that it could be done without taking away anything from the adults. We鈥檝e done Club Med and other AI resorts and I think the Majestic could do a much better job on this with very little effort. It鈥檚 important to us for our daughter to make friends and have fun so this would be a serious consideration about whether to return here.Food 鈥?while I was not expecting to be wowed by the food by day 7 it was becoming very tiresome. Breakfast was fine but lunches and dinners became extremely monotonous 鈥?overcooked meat and fish, lots of casserole type things sitting in sauces plus the usual burgers etc. We did have a pretty good meal at Le Gourmet For lunches I ended up eating salads and taking fresh cut veggies etc from the made to order pasta station and cobbling together a somewhat crunchy, healthful salad. Dinner 鈥?made to order pasta was a good choice as you knew it wasn鈥檛 sitting there for ages. We did really enjoy stopping by the lobby bar every evening for a drink before dinner. The property is especially beautiful at night.We only made it to one show as they start at 10pm and a day filled with sun, swim and rum cocktails sends us to bed somewhat early. The show we saw was the Circus and it far exceeded my expectations. It is a sort of mini Cirque du Soleil and was extremely professional and entertaining.After watching the Friday Ms. Bikini contest my only comment is that apparently Lap Dancing 101 must be part of the curriculum in most US and European high schools. It was an interesting sight to watch parents egg on their 18 year old daughters to shimmy away for the audience of leering men. I鈥檓 no prude but yikes people!I think it鈥檚 all about managing your expectations. This is a solid 3 star hotel. It鈥檚 not a place I would ever choose to get married or honeymoon but that鈥檚 just me. It鈥檚 a good place to come with extended family (we saw lots of large family groups), lots of young couples and singles and really, for the price, it鈥檚 a great getaway.

<Content>I had the time of my life I just got back from Punta Cana...My family went with a group of 39 firefighters from August 18th to the 23rd and I can honestly say that every single person is ready to come back again...Other than some minor problems on the ATV trip we all agreed that the resort and the service was incredible. The animation team treated everyone like celebrities and I would especially like to thank Walther (Jose Reyes), Jesus, Miki (Mickey Mouse) and William at the pool bar for making my stay such a great time. They all went out of their way to make sure we were having fun and getting the service we needed. From the minute we got there the check-in was easy and we were greeted with ice cold drinks and from the moment we left we were treated like royalty. Thank you to all there who made our vacation one we will remember forever.

We stayed there from Aug 17 to 24th.Flight: Excellent - Flew with Air Canada and the flights were prefectArrival, departure and transportation to and from resort: Excellent- took us less than 1 陆 from the time we arrived until we checked into our room. It was prefect. Departure was prefect as well.Beach 鈥?Amazing 鈥?one of the best we have ever been to.Pool: Good - Large but not inspiring.Facilities: Good 鈥?well maintainedFood: Good 鈥?Breakfast selection is amazing but everything else is average.Staff: Average - Hardworking but not friendly.Room: Poor - specious but poorly decorated. Sink was leaking, closet handles broken and furnishing is wobbly. The opening between the room and the bathroom is not a good idea when you have kids.

<Content>Pretty Good Our stay at the Majestic was a little nicer than I expected. Whenever you travel internationally, you have to expect a lower standard. This hotel was comparable to a 3.5 star hotel in the US. The food was pretty cafeteria-ish. There were things you could find to eat but I enjoy eating meals as part of the experience of being on vacation. This was more about finding food to subside the hunger. The grounds of the hotel were totally beautiful and the hotel rooms were a tad above average. The alcohol is standard for an all-inclusive experience. We saw a lot of other hotels while we were there and this one was by far the nicest (although I would have liked to be able to see excellence). The beach at punta cana was the most gorgeous beach I have ever seen and is worth traveling for. If you are more about a luxury style of vacation and don't like to be too out of your comfort zone, I would suggest traveling to Cancun to get the really expensive looking 5 star experience. I would travel to punta cana again with my family because we are accustomed to internation travel and know what to expect. (Also, we did the party boat cruise and I would definately recommend doing this! It was a highlight of our trip!)

<Content>Sadly Disappointed Our family just returned from a week at the Majestic Colonial and sadly we were disappointed!! It was our first time to Punta Cana; we have travelled to Mexico many times, but thought we would give the Dominican a try.The beach and the weather we had was the best we have ever had on any holiday we have travelled. The beach was really the only thing that made our trip an enjoyable one!We had booked a garden view room, but was given a room that faced the construction of the new addition to the resort. I had complained to the front desk, but they told me there was no other rooms available...whatever!!The staff was friendly, but there was very limited staff!! At the pool bars or the outdoor bars, you would need to wait at least 10 minutes before you were served!! Half the time we just gave up waiting. And the alcoholic drinks were poorly made! The tropical drinks were spoiled with too much alcohol in them!! We ended up just drinking bottled water! The soft drinks were not any better, they were very warm with ice cubes put in them.The food was another big disappointment!! We ate at the buffet mostly because we had our 2 boys with us. The food was bland, not much variety - same food every day!! Big disappointment!!!The pool was nice....but we spent most of our time at the beach! The beach is gorgeous!! Most beautiful beach we have seen!The nightlife.....we'll let's just say...there isnt one. Thank goodness our boys were content playing pool, or chess in the sports area. If it did rain....I wouldnt know what we would have done to keep us entertained??Overall....I would not recommend this resort to my friends or family. Because it was our first time to Punta Cana I can not compare it to another resort....but we will definately travel back to Mexico before to travel to Punta Cana again!

<Content>Beautiful resort This was our 2nd time to Punta Cana, and our 1st stay at the Majestic. It was tough not to compare to our previous resort stay at the Grand Palladium Bavaro four years ago! The first thing we noticed was the tremendous amount of construction going on as we entered the hotel grounds. We were a bit disappointed at the landscaping, as this could not compare to the beautiful grounds of the Grand Palladium. Keep in mind, the construction. Once we entered the lobby, check in was quick, easy, and we were greeted with a Majestic non-alcoholic drink, which is just want we needed after our long trip. While we were not escorted to our room as our other travel companions had been, getting around and finding our room was quite easy. Compared to the Grand Palladium, the Majestic is on much smaller grounds, although still quite large. We had two adjoining rooms with 7 in our party. The rooms were quite amazing! Every room is a suite, and they are top notch. I have read a lot of reviews about the bathrooms being open. While this is true for the tub and sink area, the toilet and shower stalls have coated-glass doors, and there is privacy. Each room has a balcony with table and chairs, and we had a beautiful view of the pool area and an ocean view (rooms 3332 and 3333). We did have a problem the first two days with the room sensor system. This system indicates when you are in or out of your room, and it also shuts off the fan and air conditioning system while you are out. The problem with ours was that it constantly thought we were out and kept shutting off. After contacting the front desk several times and finally getting the manager of the hotel and the manager of maintenance, they were able to override the system, and the problem was fixed. We were told that this is a known problem with a few rooms in the hotel... so just beware. We also had several power outages nightly, which the staff blamed on financial issues in the country, whatever that means.As for the food, I think it was pretty average. We had some really good meals, and we had some really average meals. I do think they could have catered more towards little children (we traveled with a 6 year old). The food at the Grand Palladium was excellent, and although the food at Majestic was good too, I think GP was just a bit better. We ate at the Hibachi, which was probably one of the best meals, although our chef was new and didn't give us quite the show we expected. The steak house restuarant was quite good, although there was nothing on the menu for children. We asked for a hot dog, which we know they serve at lunch, but we were told they could not provide us with one, so our son had a roll for dinner, which was the case most evenings in every restaurant, even the buffet. We finally wised up by the middle of the week and took about 3 hot dogs at lunch and wrapped them up for dinner, so at least our son had something to eat. We were disappointed that the sports bar, which served hamburgers, nachos, buffalo wings, etc. was only opened at 11:00 pm, at which time our 6 yo was already sleeping. I guess again, in comparison to the Grand Palladium, they had a 24-hour sports bar that had everything from hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, popcorn, nachos, ice cream, etc. I guess I was expecting the same 24 hour service. Other than that, none of us went home starving or losing any weight!The drinks were plentiful. Each day we tried to find a new special of the day drink. The Majestics with rum were great... as were the dirty bananas, banama mamas, and the blue lagoons. We found that the best drinks were in the hotel lobby (nice and frozen). The pool and beach were excellent. I must say that even though the hotel was booked, you would never know by looking at the pool/beach. We never had a problem finding a chair, or group of chairs (14 of us all together), and we did not hit the pool/beach until at least 11:00 am. There were plenty of activities at both each day, and we all took advantage of everything we could, even the 6 yo. They do have a Kids Club, but the activities there were not too appealing to him, as there were more fun things to do at the beach or pool. Shopping - if you want to take a nice long walk to burn off some of those extra drink and food calories, you can walk to the beach market, which is approximately 2-1/2 miles down the beach (facing the ocean, turn right and start walking). Just remember, it is about 2-1/2 miles back, although we did see a water taxi...but we did not use this, so I cannot comment. Every Thursday vendors come to the shopping area at the hotel. It is your typical jewelry and art work with lots and lots of haggling. One rule of thumb... they always at least double their asking price... so make sure you start out really low, and if you get it for at least half of what they asked in the beginning, you'll be okay. You can also barter in the hotel shops (which I didn't realize until this trip). Excursions - we took the safari outback excursion, which was pretty good. It is an all day trip where you will be driving most of the time (manual jeeps). They take you to a cigar factory where you can purchase cigars, rum, vanilla, cocoa, etc. We went to a family home where they share with you some homemade hot cocoa and island fruits with a chance to buy coffee, cocoa, vanilla, etc. We then went to lunch on a horse ranch, which was pretty good, and then we went horseback riding on the mountain. After that, we traveled to the other side of the island to the ocean with some beautiful scenery. The trip was $90 per person US, and it was well worth it... but it is an exhausting day. Overall, our trip to the Majestic was an enjoyable one. The staff was top notch, and we knew a lot of their names before we left. I would definitely visit this resort again, but next time I would be more prepared as far as the food was concerned for my children. I cannot say which hotel I liked more, the Grand Palladium or Majestic, as they each had their own qualities that I really really liked. The Majestic had much nicer rooms and was easier to get around. The Palladium had much better food with a much larger variety of restuarants. I guess it is in the preference of the visitor which is more important. Like I said, we did not go hungry, no one got sick, and we all had an amazing time!

<Content>A good time was had by all.. This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic. We stayed at the Majestic Colonial from 8/16 through 8/22. My wife and I were traveling with four kids ages 15-21. We stayed in a beach front room and the kids stayed in a garden room in the same building. The resort is situated perpendicular to the beach, so with a beach front room you are a couple of hundred yards from the main building and the restaurants and activities there, which was not a problem for us because a walk after dinner was welcomed by all. The reverse of this is that if you are going for the beach and are in a lower numbered room closer to the main building, the walk to and from your room to the beach could be an inconvenience. The rooms are well maintained and well designed, constructed off all stone and woods with a very open layout. Every room has a jacuzzi tub. The shower is large enough for two with room to spare. The water pressure is somewhat low, but that is not unusual for island resorts. The in room refrigerator was restocked with soda, water, and beer every day. Every room has a safe, hair dryer, and iron. We did not have a problem with cleaning service. We did not have a problem with insects that I have read on some other reviews. Remember that this is a tropical island and a moth, ant, or spider can be expected. Is your house that tight that you have never seen an insect inside? The grounds are very well kept with constant gardening being done by the grounds crew. The food was average to good. The breakfast at the main building is much better than the breakfast at the beach. There is a larger selection and the food seemed fresher. The same can be said about lunch. The beach food is a little greasier and there is less of a selection. It also gets a little more crowded at the beach lunch than the main building restaurant so there can be wait times at the grill or stations. We found the quality of the dinners in the ala carte restaurants to be good. For dinner the steak house on the beach, Rodeo Grill, had a good atmosphere and the food was good. I found the Chateaubriand cooked perfectly and very tender. My kids had the sirloin which was also tender. The French restaurant, Le Gourmet, was also good. The guacamole martini appetizer was very good, as was the pumpkin coconut soup. Lobster Bisque was fair, although my 18 year old son had three of them! I tried the beef tenderloin which I thought was very good. My wife had the chicken and risotto which was also good. I thought the meat in general was good. When I asked I was told that all the beef was local. I found the Dominican restaurant, Taino, to be the best and most flavorful of the hotels restaurants. The Dominican Soup was very good. The Paella was also a hit. We did not get into the Japanese restaurant so I can't say anything about that except reserve early! The bars in the main building are the best for relaxing and meeting people. The service here was also better than at the other bars on the property. In general we found the service to be somewhat indifferent, although there were some who went out of their way to help. A knowledge of some Spanish was helpful in this regard as it made communicating our requests easier. If you are going to drink, you must try the Mamauana!The Animation Team will get you involved if you are caught napping at the beach or pool. They are friendly and fun. There was never a problem finding a place to sit in the sun or shade. There was plenty of room and the towel game was kept to a minimum. The beach is beautiful and kept very clean by hotel staff. There is a barrier reef a couple of hundred yards off shore that keeps the water at shore calm so swimming and snorkeling off shore is easy. If you are going to swim outside of the buoy line you have to be aware of boat traffic and hopefully they are aware of you. The snorkeling off shore right in front of the resort is poor, mostly dead coral and some common fish. If you head to the right down the beach a few hundred yards there is a reef right off shore within the buoy lines of the RIU(?) that is pretty good and safe as far as the boats go. We also did parasailing down at this part of the beach which was cheaper, $70 for 2 people vs. $85 at our resort. We all had a good time with this. The only organized tour we did was the Zipline Adventure, which I booked from home online. The ride to the interior was a fun 45 minutes that gave us a chance to see the towns and country side, which was the same route as the Island Safari as we saw their buses on the roads to and from the Zipline. The staff at the Zipline was very professional and the equipment very safe. I would recommend this trip to the adventurer in everyone.The Dominican Republic is a Spanish speaking country so a knowledge of some Spanish is very helpful. We had four kids with us who were fresh out of school with years of Spanish behind them. Communicating with the local people in their language seemed to get us a little more respect and attention on and off the resort. A Four Star resort on an island is not the same as a four star resort in your homeland. Your vacation will be as good as you make it. Roll with the minor problems, speak to the local people, learn the local customs, enjoy the beach and sun and you will have a good time.

<Content>Loved the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana We have been to many all inclusive hotels over the years and we rank the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana as the best ever. My daughter was married on the beach there and the wedding package was fantastic. We had a party of 27 and everyone enjoyed the celebration, the food, the outstanding service, and the gorgeous site. We wish to acknowledge several staff members who made our stay memorable and I hope that this is the appropriate forum so that they may be recognized by the hotel management. Walther (Mosquito), a beach activities organizer, was so fun and friendly that he rapidly became our favorite character. High praise to him, you couldn't have a better goodwill ambassador. Sandra, the wedding coordinator did a great job organizing the ceremony--it was beautiful. Finally, Omar, the beachside seafood restaurant maitre d', oversaw the wedding dinner and several other dining experiences in a very friendly and helpful manner. Our thanks to him.What a beautiful hotel the Majestic Colonial is and management can be proud of the courteous and friendly staff.

<Content>Incredible Everything was great, the hotel is spectacular, the room very comfortable and with everything we need, including a jacuzzi inside which was great. The service was incredible, everybody was eager to help us in any way possible, specially Denny, the beach concierge, who made our stay more enjoyable. I'm just looking forward to go back.

<Content>Fabulous! Perfect family vacation! Honestly, we never had a better vacation, regretting only that we didn't find the Majestic until now! Some of the negative reviews posted right before we left for Punta Cana almost made me switch hotels, and all I can say is we were all delighted with our stay at the Majestic! So glad we didn't change our reservations!This was our second trip to the D.R., but our first stay at the Majestic. We will DEFINITELY vacation here again. The Majestic is absolutely gorgeous, and the physical layout of the resort makes it so easy to enjoy all of it. We are a family of 5, children aged 20, 15, and 10, and EVERY ONE of us loved the Majestic. We are beach lovers, and this beach is gorgeous, there was always a nice breeze, the water was clear and refreshing, and there was plenty of shade. We didn't expect to join in any activities, but we did and loved it! Beach volleyball with Walter (loco mosquito boy!), and John, and beach aerobics with John were our favorite activities. All the animacion team work very hard to make sure that the guests have fun, and we especially appreciated the efforts of John and Walter! We usually don't participate in group activities, as we enjoy swimming and reading on the beach, but we started with the kids being encouraged on Sunday, August 17, by another member of the animacion team to play Bocce (didn't get his name, also a funny, hard-working, friendly guy) and they were reluctant and shy at first, but the animacion gentleman pulled them in to play, and they ended up having a blast! From there, we were happy to participate in beach volleyball, coconut throwing contest, aerobics, stretching, and it was fun to watch the volleyball when we were too hot to play, and especially when Walter (loco mosquito boy!) was keeping score, which he and Jon both did in French, Spanish and English!! We are from the US and enjoyed the games along with people from all over the world. Our 10-year old son joined in the Kids Club soccer game on the beach, and ended up making friends who he enjoyed playing with the rest of our stay. The staff in the main buffet and the beach buffet were generally very attentive and most of the staff spoke English, Spanish, and we heard a good bit of French spoken by the staff, too. Very friendly, pleasant staff all around.Since our 10-year old son is a picky eater and not very patient waiting for food at a restaurant, we ate all meals at the buffet, and we always found food to please everyone. The crepes (especially those made by the magician chef early in the week) were delicious at breakfast, there was always fresh fruit and pastries galore. At dinner, there was always something to be found that was delicious and filling, especially the fish and chicken, vegetables and fruit.One day there was paella on the beach for lunch....lobster, shrimp, all cooked in front of us, with the animacion team encouraging everyone to come join in for the stirring! THe paella itself was delicious!We had excellent service every day on the beach by Denny, the beach concierge. We always had cold water, cervezas and Majestic drinks to savor!We didn't expect to go to any of the shows, but the way this place is laid out, the theater is right off the path from the buffet/lobby bar area to the rooms, so we did wander over to the Michael Jackson show, which John and the other animacion team members encouraged us to watch, talking it up on the beach in the afternoon. Well, we had fun watching it, the cast all worked hard and it was hot to be working so hard. If there were only big fans in the theatre like there are at the airport, we would have stayed longer at the show.The circus show featured some very talented acrobats and stunts, and was also entertaining, but again, we were too hot to stay for all of it.The rooms were gorgeous, the layout was fine. The shower is large enough to change in if you want privacy. We are a modest family, and felt fine in these rooms. The power did go out sometimes, but only very briefly and the air conditioner was easy enough to reset the few times we needed to.The balcony was great....there is enough of an overhang that we were able to sit out there on Friday when Tropical Storm Fay was hitting the island, reading, while it was windy and rainy. The layout again is worth mentioning, as you can walk to the buffet and lobby area without getting wet and staying in the shade, as the walkways are covered.We saw many families with strollers, older people with walkers, and it seems that everything was easily accessible for all.We booked this vacation with Bookit.com and the agent onsite was Turinter who also ran the shuttle from the airport. Everything was perfectly handled.We left several dollars for the maids everyday, and also left $ in the fridge or handed it directly to the minibar guy everyday. We tipped at each meal and we tipped everyone who served us. All of these people work very hard. We were glad to have had a lot of $1 bills with us for tipping.TIPS: Buy some cheap washcloths at the Dollar Store, colored ones if possible, and drape one over each faucet to remind you not to use the water for toothbrushing. Use the bottled water for that.We also bought cheap inflatable rafts with us, and our own snorkels. Bring plenty of sunscreen! WE didn't have any problem with bugs or mosquitos, but had supplies with us if we needed them. Bring a towel from home, colorful, to help you identify your chairs on the beach. Bring large ziploc bags for the wet bathing suits you'll have to pack up when you leave.This truly was a wonderful vacation. We usually spend a week at the Jersey shore, which we love, in August, but I have to say this may replace that from here on. To be able to be on the beach all day until after 7pm without being too cold, without greenhead flies, to be able to swim without being cold, to have a breeze that is gentle and cooling, yet not cold, and to have fun watching or playing games on the beach, and exercise on the beach everyday, was HEAVENLY!Top it off with being able to walk up to the buffet on the beach for lunch, and bar service on the beach! Can't ask for anything more!We were also happy to be able to attend Mass at the Chapel onsite on Saturday evening, even though it was in Spanish! Thanks. Annmarie for your help and emails before we arrived. Thanks to John and Walter and all the Animacion Team on the beach! Thanks to Denny, our fabulous beach concierge! We hope to be back within the year! And every year hereafter!~~Mara

<Content>Mixed feelings My family members are Dominican natives, so every summer we go and vacation there and stay at new resorts. The Majestic has by far been the best pick. In total, there were 63 of us staying at the majestic and considering the large number of us staying there, check in was VERY fast. It will usually take about an hour at the least for us to be checked in and this time it took only about 20 minutes. Upon arrival they greet you with a cold towel and a cold colata which is great for the tropical weather. I would assume that since it only took 20 minutes to check in 63 people it would take even less time to check in a smaller group.FOODBefore going on the trip I religiously came to trip advisor to catch up on new reviews. I became worried about the food and I find that although it wasn't gourmet food, it was fine. The food was pretty basic. You can always find something to eat at the supreme buffet. Don't eat the pancakes at breakfast, they were awful, but the waffles are great! For lunch and dinner they have a lot of varieties so you will find something, believe me! You can also try one of the restaurants although we had a terrible experience at La Hispaniola restaurant: the service was horrible! They didn't take our orders til about 25 minutes after we sat and the food didn't come til about 40 mins after we ordered (and only 5 of us were at my table, everyone else was eating somewhere else or had already eaten). And it wasn't even out waiter who brought us our food! We had to ask another man to find out where our food was. After that night I decided to stick to the buffet, where I know how long it will take to get my food!SERVICEAs I just said, the service at La Hispaniola restaurant was terrible, but since I didn't try any other restaurants I can't speak for them. Service at the door of the buffet can also be a bit unrefined during lunch hour. Since during those hours (12 noon- 3pm) people are either on the beach on in the pool, when they want to go to lunch they are wet. The people at the door do not tolerate that and will make you go back to your rooms and change (try to get a room not ending in a number after 25 if you want to be close to the buffet). Service everywhere else was pretty ordinary. Nothing to brag about. HOWEVER! There are some men by the beach who claim to take you in a boat ride to see dolphins, to a natural pool, and scuba diving. DO NOT DO IT. The dolphins we saw were part of another resort and were putting on a show about 80 feet away for people who paid for it. Standing so far trying to see was embarrassing! The natural pool was nice, it was at the beach and about 4 feet deep away from the shore so it was nice. NOT worth the 2 HOUR trip on a very small boat though. And about the scuba diving, YEAH right. If you want to do real scuba diving speak to someone who comes to the pool everyday to give scuba lessons. They had a bucket full of goggles and used mouth pieces covered in sand and salt water. It was gross.THE WORST PART OF ALL was when we ran out of gas about 40 minutes away from the resort. The man had to swim to shore to buy gasoline. We were very upset!!! There were 25 of us in two boats and some of the people on one boat were paying for some people on the other boat and vice versa. The two men driving the boats pretended like no one paid so we ended up paying double for the boat ride from hell!! DON'T DO IT! Stick to ALL resort activities and make SURE they WORK for the resort! That was the mistake we made; believing they had a partnership with the resort. Stick to things in the resort and you will have a wonderful time.RESORT GROUNDSLet's get back to the positives. The resort is beautiful. It almost seems fake. Everything is gorgeous. The pool is huge, the beach is beautiful. The theater area has extremely comfortable seating which is more than I can say for any other resort I've been to in the Dominican Republic. You will want to take a picture of every inch of the resort. ROOMSThe rooms are nice. They don't do the pictures on the website justice but they are nice. They are always well stocked and they are HUGE. The bathroom is a bit odd because it's not really in a room it's just an open space. The shower and toilet have doors but the sink and jacuzzi and very visible. On my last night there the light went out about 6 times but I wasn't in my room for any of it. I didn't really mind because the light would always come right back on and I'm sure it was a problem just occurring during that , particularly since on my last night there Tropical Storm Fay was around. OVERALL EXPERIENCEOverall I had an incredible time. The only thing I can really complain about is the boat ride from hell which isn't really the resorts fault because it's not part of their activities. My other cousins did resort activities like parisailing and kayaking and loved it so as long as you stick to resort activities, you will have a great time. The service can sometimes be a little lackluster but I was hardly in need of service so it wasn't a big deal to me. I do recommend this hotel but purely because of how beautiful it was, not for the service or food.

<Content>Paradise We were at the Majestic from Aug. 9 to Aug. 16. After reading some previous reviews, I had to comment. I have no idea what these people are talking about. The resort is beautiful. The staff bend over backwards for you, the food is excellent. There is nothing negative for me to say about this resort. If you don't like this resort, then there is something wrong with you.There is a choice of 7 restaurants. We tried tall of them. For breakfast the buffet offers custom omelettes with a choice of ham, onion, peppers, tomatoes, cheese. What more do you want?? You also had the choice of bacon (just like home), sausage, potatoes, cold cereals, fruits, yogurt, waffles, pancakes, crepes. Need I go on??? It was delicious.Usually for lunch we went to the buffet or grabbed something quickly at the beach restaurant. The indoor buffet was excellent especially the pasta bar where you have a choice of 3-4 pastas and 5-6 sauces. Excellent!! We went to the beach restaurant a couple of times. Not as much choice and yes there are some flies around, what do you expect??? We get flies around our food at home when we eat outdoors too!!! There was always food available, 24 hours! If you want, there was also a 24 take out restaurant over near the disco which serves nachos, hamburgers, wings, hotdogs, fries around the clock. We know because we were there at 4 in the morning.The dinners were very good. The lobster was excellent and if you finished your first plate you could get a second serving. We did that. The steakhouse was amazing. The chateaubriand was tender and tasty. The french restaurant we had beef tenderloin and it was excellent. The mexican was good, not our favourite. The Japanese was incredibly delicious!We have no complaints about the food. The drinks were excellent as well. Some people commented that the drinks were watered down. Well, I had to leave at least 3-4 drinks because they were too strong, and I can drink! They are very generous when pouring the drinks. Bottled water was always available at any of the bars whether you wanted 1 or 12, they accommodated you.The rooms and the hotel itself are beautiful! Yes, there were some blackouts last week, but hey, Tropical Storm Fay hit on Friday and yes the power did go out! Duh!The beach is incredible and there were always waiters walking around taking drink orders. Entertainment was excellent! The pool is extremely nice, warm and clean.I honestly have nothing negative to say about this resort and I have travelled to several resorts in the past from Mexico to Puerto Plata to Jamaica. This is honestly the nicest resort I've stayed at and well worth the money by far.

<Author>jduyk727
<Content>Beautiful resort, but... My family and I (6 adults, 8 kids/teens) just returned from our stay at the Majestic, and I wanted to share our experience. We have stayed at many all-inclusive resorts over the years, and have been to Punta Cana before as well (my husband and I stayed at Excellence last March, and absolutely loved it). Although we genuinely enjoyed our vacation at The Majestic, there were several problems that fellow travelers need to be aware of, and that management at the resort really needs to address. First, here鈥檚 what we liked: Check-in was fast and easy, and our interaction with Madeleine at Guest Services was a pleasure. The beach, pool and resort grounds are all very beautiful and seem to be well maintained. Everything you鈥檝e heard about the beach is true - it is absolutely spectacular, and the water is amazing. Plus, there are always plenty of lounge chairs and shade both at the pool and the beach. The Animation team is friendly and fun, and there are plenty of enjoyable activities to keep all ages happy. Our rooms were cleaned every day, and contained several nice amenities (e.g. hair dryer, iron, DVD player, Jacuzzi, etc.). The entertainment was enjoyable (especially the Circus Show), the sports bar and casino were both lots of fun, and the staff was generally very nice. All in all, we had a good time. On the down side, the food isn鈥檛 very good, nor very plentiful. You certainly won鈥檛 starve, but the portions (in the sit-down) restaurants are small, and it is difficult to get a second helping. This is the only all-inclusive that we鈥檝e stayed at where staff refused to bring what we ordered. In fact, at most other resorts, the staff is eager to please you, and will usually bring you anything you鈥檇 like. At the Majestic, however, this doesn鈥檛 seem to be the case. On our first night at the resort, we went to the Seafood restaurant and my husband ordered the grouper. The portion was small and the fish was bland, so after he finished his dinner, he asked for the lobster (my daughter had ordered it, and liked it). He was told NO; when we protested, the waiter relented, but then never brought out the dinner. We finally gave up, and walked up to the Main Buffet. This happened again the following evening at the ala cart Asian restaurant when we each ordered two appetizers. Other people at the resort reported the same thing happening to them, so it definitely wasn鈥檛 an isolated instance (by the way, just so you know, both my husband and my children are all quite thin, and were not really looking to gorge themselves). Also, there are generally no snack foods available during the late afternoon; in other resorts, snacks such as chips and salsa, chicken wings, grilled foods, etc. are available all day by the beach. However, much to the disappointment of my children, this was not the case at The Majestic. One last comment regarding the food - the mixed drinks (including the 鈥渇rozen鈥?drinks) are not very cold, are usually watered down, and most have a funny after-taste; as a result, we generally stuck to sodas and bottled water, but even they weren鈥檛 very cold either. Also, while the staff is usually pretty nice, the service (in the restaurants, not the bars) is quite slow - especially for drink/water orders. Another issue was that our keys stopped working numerous times during the week. My husband, children and I stayed in two adjacent rooms on the second floor of building 2 (a very nice location facing the beach). Between us, we had 4 keys - 2 for each room. Over the course of our vacation, each of us had to replace our keys many times. While this wasn鈥檛 exactly the end of the world, it was extremely frustrating and inconvenient - mostly because the main lobby/front desk was a good 10 minute walk away. Imagine trudging all the way up to your room to use the 鈥渇acilities,鈥?only to learn that...surprise... your key doesn鈥檛 work. Talk about uncomfortable situations! Anyway, that brings me to a problem that seems to be common in the DR: out of the 14 people in our party, more than half had tummy troubles - including my two children (mercifully, my husband and I were spared). Was that because of the food, the water, the heat? I have no idea, but I suggest that anyone visiting the Majestic ( or anywhere in the DR) pack a large supply of Immodium! Another observation I鈥檇 like to share is that the resort seems to have been built in a hurry (I think this was mentioned by other reviewers as well). Although all our concerns (broken toilet seat, bad outlet, broken safe, etc.) were attended to quickly, a resort this new probably shouldn鈥檛 have so many issues. We heard the same complaints from several other travelers at the resort, so again, this was not an isolated instance. One other indication that the resort may have been built quickly/poorly is that we had 4 blackouts during our week's stay; two lasted 30 plus minutes, and two were brief - all were annoying. Each time a blackout occurred, the thermostat in our room had to be reset, and the air-conditioning had to be turned on again. Since none of the blackouts seemed to affect the resort adjacent to the Majestic, the cause was probably internal. If you do decide to go to The Majestic, I strongly suggest that you bring a flashlight or two...it is very dark around the resort grounds, especially during a blackout. Finally, our last complaint was (as far as we know) an isolated issue: on the second night of our stay, we discovered an island 鈥渞oach鈥?the size of a mouse in our room. Seriously, I鈥檓 not kidding - it was huge!! Sadly, that was not the end of it; although Guest Services quickly fumigated our room, we also discovered several regular-sized roaches throughout the remainder of the week. As you can imagine, this put a major damper on our stay. Now, I realize that The Majestic is in a tropical location, and I also completely understand that bugs (ants, mosquitos, flies, etc.) are part of the deal in the Carribean... BUT, I draw the line at roaches. I should mention, however, that none of the other members in our group had this problem (including our two children in the room next door to us), so maybe roaches are not really a big problem at the resort...maybe we were just unlucky. Unfortunately, this one issue will probably prevent me from returning to The Majestic anytime soon.

<Content>Great resort very mediocre food Arrival at PUJ was one of the fastest arrive and out of the airport experiances I have ever had. Leaving however was a nightmare of waiting in long lines in very hot and humid weather. Our travel agent arranged round trip transfers, if you have 3 people or more in your group in is a far better option to take a taxi, about $45, less money and you won't have to visit numerous other hotel properties on the way to and from yoursyours, plus you won't have to leave 4 hours or so ahead of departure time. The Majestic property is large, well maintained and an exceptional value. It is important to remember that you are visiting a third world country. To put this in perspective the people that look after you on property earn room, board and about $200 per month so they welcome and encourage you to tip them. On occasion this will get you better service, but for the most part it won't. I tried overtipping as well, it didn't work. In their defense they hustle continuously and put out great effort, I just felt that they were overwhelmed the majority of the tome. To echo everyone else on here the beach and pool are great with plenty of seating and shade available. However the service for drinks at both is sporadic at best.The rooms were fine, maid service was never consistent and they even missed on day untill we called them. We never saw a bug in our room. They knew better..........................The food was by far the most dissapointiong aspect of the entire trip. Except for the breakfast buffet which was as good as you can get in far superior resorts. The rest was to put it bluntly rubbish. I nferior quality and for the most part was precooked which accounts for most guests complaint with the lack of flovor or the toughness. One evening we went off property to  Jelltfish  , a great exdperience and I strongly recommend it to anyone travelling to the area. The power outages were annoying at best and ould have made impact no on our opinion of the resort. Our kids ages 18, 22 and 23 enjoyed the trip but we have both decided that we would not return.

<Content>9.5 out of 10 - One of the best in the region The sign of a great hotel is what happens when there is a problem. By this measure the Majestic certainly gets (at least) to great. Our travel agent screwed up our holiday completely. Without Oscar the Majestic's Operations Manager's personal intervention our holiday was toast. Oscar and his team fixed it for us without charge and without any fuss. 99 out of 100 hotels would have washed their hands of the problem, Oscar didn't - Thank you.On top of this the Majestic serves up quality food, quality entertainment and lots of it. The entertainment team put on shows that would run in London's West End or on Broadway.Hygene levels perfect, friendly staff, great pool, safe and well organised. Minimal biting insects and flies, tidy and well kept site - lots of attention to detail.If I were to get really picky then I just didn't get the open plan bathroom - a bit too intimate for my liking having a bath in the middle of my bedroom! Others may love it.Would I go back - you bet - one of our best holidays ever.

<Author>upstateny29
<Content>A completely honest opinion - Do not go here! I returned from the Majestic last night and I feel obligated to give everyone an honest and complete review of the hotel.First off, when we got to the hotel, the check-in was relatively easy and we were greeted with cold towels and a drink. The drink tasted good but it was very watered down and not that cold.The hotel grounds were beautiful. The pool is clean and warm. There are flowers and palm trees everywhere. It was truly beautiful. The rooms (we got the Junior Suite) were huge. However, the craftsmanship was lacking. The paint on the trim was awful, the siding on the bathroom was falling off, the pillows were kind of gross (bring your own if possible), etc.Food - NOT GOOD! Breakfast was at the buffet supreme place. It was decent - not amazing or anything. But I was full and found things that i could live with. The omelet station only has ham, onions, peppers, tomatoes, and cheese to choose from, but you can grab some bacon from the side or whatever else and add it in. You can also ask for egg whites only.For lunch, we usually went to the the buffet supreme. But one day we went to the beach buffet place because we came back so late. HUGE MISTAKE!! THere was barely any food out and the food that was out was covered with huge flies. I did find a burger to eat, but about 3 bites into it, I realized that the buns were covered with tiny brown ants!!!! I went back to the buffet line and saw that they were hard to see, but on all of the buns. Also they were on the nachos.For dinner on the first night, we went to the Seafood place and my dad's lobster was not cooked all the way. Also, it looked like it was burnt. I had the grouper, which was bland and mushy. The seafood bisque is overly salty and had sand in it. For dessert, you go up to a buffet line, which had tons of flies on it.The next night, we went to the Steak place (right next to the seafood). I had read tons of reviews before going and heard that the chateaubriand was amazing. It's not. It was very tough, so get the sirloin instead. It was much more tender. The beef broth was really salty and had no spice whatsoever. The dessert was the same as the seafood place.The mexican place was probably the place that I got the best meal. I had the filet/steak meal and it was very tender. The guacamole on the side was also very good. However, there is also a Dominican buffet (decent-not great) that had buns with bugs all over them. I got a vodka seltzer there, but it was like vodka and water. We also tried Le Gourmet - it was OK. The steak and potatoes was the best one to try. THe chicken was awful! The risotto was not risotto - it was made with regular long grain rice, not aborio rice, so it had a funny texture. The creme brulee had no brulee on top and it was uncooked in the middle. I had the worst stomach problems the next morning after this, so I was thinking it was the uncooked creme brulee.Basically, the food is pretty repetitive - each place serves the same thing each night and the buffets are always the same. Nothing new and exciting and there is nothing to rave about.Maid Service: I tipped the first morning and left some bottles of sample perfume with it. I thought I would get the best service after this but nothing was really cleaned except the bed was made and the towels were exchanged. The mirror in the closet was REALLY dirty from the day we checked in - I mean someone smeared lotion on it and it stayed like that throughout the whole trip. For the first two days, the room got cleaned relatively early in the day (around 1 or 2pm). However, the last few days, it wasn't cleaned until after 5:30pm and it was after my boyfriend asked the maid 3 or 4 times. We wanted to have dinner at 6:30 and shower beforehand so it was really annoying, especially after we tipped so much.There isn't much to do other than lay out at the pool or beach. THe shows are a waste of time. I read someone's review that the circus show was good. Are you kidding me? All I saw were some arm movements and a guy swinging on a swing set. If you do decide to go, bug spray yourself a lot. I had tons and tons of bug bites each night there.The casino is very very small. It really a low budget deal there. I like to play blackjack and the minimum bet is $5US. If you get a blackjack and the dealer isn't showing a face card or ace, you get half a $5 chip that you have to play the next hand. If you have blackjack and the dealer is showing a face card or an ace, you don't get paid until the dealer shows his or her hand and if they have blackjack, you lose. Ridiculous!!The picture place is a ripoff - if you want a CD of your pictures, it's 10 dollars per picture on the CD. They tried to get my sister to pay $990 for a CD of pictures. Also, the power went off at least 6 or 7 times throughout the vacation, especially on the last two days. The A/C in the room must be reset each time. It's annoying to do that each time in the middle of the night or wake up to a really hot room at 4am.I will never go back here. It was not worth the money and my time. I wish I had gone on a cruise instead or a different resort.

<Content>Animation Team Our stay @ The Majestic Colonial was fabulous! The room was gorgeous,(always kept clean and restocked) We had a topfloor room which had cathedral ceilings, two sepate sleeping areas, a jacuzzi, 2 TVs a deck and also a roof top patio with a jacuzzi. We had plenty of space.The food was great and we had the best time. We traveled with two boys ages 13 and 11 and it was their first time abroad. They were very busy the whole time there and enjoyed the beautiful beach and had fun in the pool along with water sports. We want to make special mention to the Animation Team, They are very special team that made the boys stay even more enjoyable. We had fun with them also, getting us up and exercising,dance lessons, playing beach games, etc. They were extremely nice and attentive. The nightly shows were fun to watch, also.. We want to thank personally, Mosquito, Jesus, Maria, Pablo, Melvin, Nina , Jon and Leogim. All were great with us and the kids . We miss you all already, Again thank you to all of the staff. See you next year.!!Sincerely,The Samtak Family

<Content>Great Family Vacation I had a great vacation at the Magestic Colonial resort. The resort was beautiful and best suited for a family vacation. My nieces had a wonderful time. The entertainment was excellent...my favorite was the beach party. I wish they had more of the night live band playing latin music. The animation team was very friendly. My family loved John from the animation team. He was very sincere and sweet to everyone in my family. He took the time to dance with everyone from my 7 year old niece to my mother. Angelica from the kids program was excellent. She is very friendly and animated. My nieces loved her. We never trust a stranger to care for my nieces, and within our first impression of Angelica we were sold and trusted her with the care of the girls. Every single time I went to pick up my nieces, Angelica and the girls were sweating and out breath from playing. We will never forget Angelica's attentiveness and kindness. My favorite waitor was Joel from the beach restaurant. He was very attentive and friendly. I sat at the beach bar for 25 minutes waiting to be waited at while plenty of people came up and received great service, it took me asking Joel for service for a bar tender to come by way and serve me. The only thing I would have changed was the view from my room of construction. However, we spent very minimal time at the room and we made the best of it. Also, the food was just average - I was expecting better. I would rate this resort as excellent for a family vacation.

<Content>detailed description of majestic colonial CHECK IN:I have traveled with a group of 9 people. This is my ninth time going to D.R., so i have seen many lobby's and have been through many check In's and this is one of the easiest ones. Victor, the manager, has made the process very easy and he seems to be very experienced in his field of managing everything.ROOMS:As written in many other reviews, the hotel IS still going through construction! Before, victor has placed us in very dingy/ musty rooms, which is very common on the first floor. We also didn't have a nice view from the hotel (we really font care about that), so we asked to get the room changed. Victor took the liberty of changing the rooms within 10 minutes even with a booked hotel! He had upgraded us to a very nice room on the fourth floor away from the construction and with a view of the pool area, which was beautiful! for that, we gave him a small 5 dollar tip. I stayed in room 3412. I would not recommend this room because it was far away to walk to anything. If you like to be on the first floor and near the lobby, stay in room 3102. The first number stands for the building and the second number stands for the floor number. Over all, the rooms are very spacious. The one negative are the bathrooms! YOU GET NO PRIVACY! IF YOU POOP, EVERYONE IN THE ROOM WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE. The doors are like you are in a changing room. So basically, you feel as though your pooping with everyone in the bathroom. Another negative is that you get no privacy to change since the rooms are so spacious. you will need to use the bathroom or the shower room as your changing area. if you are interested in how the rooms look like, you may YouTube the room on YouTube.THE POOLS:My family HATES swimming in the pools. They believe that they come to the Caribbean to enjoy the sea and not the pools, but unlike the other hotels, this one was a different experience! The pool was fabulous! Even at 7 in the morning, the pool begins to have the temperatures come up. The pool is never over crowded! Of course there is the swim up bar, but i will mention that in another topic.THE OCEAN:Beautiful! No complaints! amazing temperatures/ no rocks, almost. But they are not a problem at all. Some are actually convenient. Excellent temperature water! There is a spot for everyone and the chairs are actually very comfortable and not cheap.THE BARSTERRIBLE! The worst bar i have ever been to! The bar tenders/ workers in the whole hotel do not understand English at all basically! it is very hard to communicate with them! There is no bar on the beach, which is terrible! The bartenders are not professional at all! They are very slow at getting your drinks and sometimes they even forget about you!...I have walked up to a bar many times and had the bar tender serve a person who just got there rather then me who has been waiting there for the past 15 min.!!! I would get sooo mad at them! i would rate the bar service a 3 out of 10! The alcohol is not good either! It is domestic and not imported. My parents did not like that at all! if you like compare, you wont like it here.ENTERTAINMENT:It was pretty good. i can't complain. They have a lot of contests which keep you entertained. If you win, you get a bottle of DOMINICAN VIAGRA as they call it (ROM). Francisco and my baby (JESUS) were the best!!! They danced with me every night until i have met people to dance with. The shows were okay. nothing special, but they weren't bad. I personally love when the people participate in the shows. The Micheal jackson show was not good compared to the other hotels. The circus and the magic show were pretty decent. The beach party was pretty boring. Shows would be a 6 out of 10.THE CLUB:Great place to meet people. There is a casino right next door. The music is very good. First the classic spanish music, then the hip hop around 12. Very good club with lots of places to sit. There is even a pool table if you like playing pool.THE FOOD:It was not bad! i love sea food! and if you like it too, do not go to the buffet cause u wont find it there. go to the sea food buffet! order lobster or shrimp..lobster was okay. Mexican restaurant, don't even bother, such a waste of time. i heard steak house was really good though! The hibachi restaurant was amazing!!! it took such a short time to cook the food and it was sooooo good!!!Any ways... you will always find something to eat!The hotel is full of Americans! i don't know whether it is because it is expensive for europeans,but the hotel is basically all American! this is why i find it hard to believe the workers do not know english. Also, there were not much teenagers there. I, myself, am 17 and it was very hard to find people my age.You must learn the taki taki dance before you get there :)

<Content>Ticks a lot of boxes but....... Spent 3 weeks in this hotel - our 7th visit to Punta Cana,but different hotels.Must admit the formula is now wearing a bit thin! Size and scale of the Majestic is comparatively user-friendly and easy to navigate your way around.Hotel design is attractive- especially at night- but the plot is fairly narrow and the pool area can get very hot and claustrophobic. Noisy hotel on one side and construction work on the other.This particular stretch of beach is becoming very busy and if you're after haciendas and vistas look elsewhere.Rooms are a strong feature - comfortable and spacious with good storage and lighting and none are overlooked but the lack of privacy between the bathroom and sleeping area will not suit everyone.The hotel is well-managed and service in all areas ranges from good to excellent. Although the hotel was full for most of the duration of our stay there were always plenty of loungers available both on the beach and by the pool and also parasols.Service in the bars a particularly strong feature, even in the night club which is open until 4am but the music is definitely geared towards hispanic tastes.Reservations required in only 2 out of the 6 a la carte restaurants and food generally OK but mediocre in the buffets.Breakfast finishes ridiculously early (by european standards) at 10am and consequently very busy.Continental breakfast available at the main beach buffet from 10.30am but this admittedly quite poor.Difficult to get a decent cup of coffee here-trying to pass off weak,stewed filter coffee with a squirt of Dairy Whip as cappucino is a bit of a joke. Animation team professional and unobtrusive and the theatre has comfortable seating and good bar service.Shops on the hotel complex are extortionate.There is a shopping complex of about 30 units just ouside the hotel- all selling the same tourist tat and not a buyer in sight! Nice spa in the hotel grounds but again fairly expensive.Annoying photographers on the beach parading monkeys/macaws etc and quite a trek to get a drink fro m the bar.Overall,this hotel has many strong features but never manages to be more than the sum of its parts.Probably not helped by the large turnover of short stay guests which generally creates an impersonal ambience.Bedrooms located in 2 main wings and the corridors act as main thoroughfares so this generates a lot of noise.Lots of lifts which is useful for guests with wheelchairs or prams.

<Content>Loved Moskito Boy We stayed at this resort for 8 days and had a wonderful time. The animation team was fantastic. Walter, Melvin and Maria did a great job of drawng the crowd into the activities. They always had smiles on their faces, especially Walter who made everyone around him smile. The shows at night were very entertaining. I would recommend this resort .

<Content>Fabuloso Great resort with super nice facilities and location. The beach was beautiful and big. The pool was grand. The wet bar was fun and busy. The food was ok. The service was decent, but if you don't speak Spanish, you won't get the best service. Everyone loved that I spoke it, but my friend did not, and she did not get the best service.However, the Equipo de Animacion, or the entertainment team, was absolutely fabulous and made our trip. We were constantly entertained by a great bunch of people, who spoke English, German, French, and of course, Spanish. Fransisco, Jesus, Yan, Maria, Rita, Ive, Henry, Melvin, Pablo, and of course, el Moskito were just great. They played games, led aerobics, held a bikini contest, taught us the salsa, merengue, and la machata, and also danced at the disco with us. They never seemed to stop working, from 930AM stretching to 12AM Taki Taki dance party, they were there!Team Animation was the best part of our resort experience, by far! Lo Mejor!

<Content>One of the Best Hotels Majestic Colonial, Punta Cana. Second time to the Dominican Republic. First time at Boca Chica, stayed at The Coral Harmaca. Needless to say the two should not be compared. Enjoyed the Breakfast Buffet. Super bread and rolls, etc. Steak/Seafood House was our favorite restaurant for Lunch and dinner. Beach was real nice, and better than I thought it would be. Rooms were nice and clean. So all in all it was a fun time. My only food issues was the food could have been hotter at Buffet. I told the managers and by day 3 it was corrected. However Jacklyn a waitress did everything possible to get my food hot the first day. She was very sweet.I had an issue with my room and it was corrected soon as possible by Roberto at the front desk. Thank you again.Check out was quick due to Mejia. Thank you.The pool was fun. But it closed toooo early.MY main issue was with HOTELBEDS (RONALD PONCE). We booked a tour to SANTO DOMINGO. We had to cut our fun filled night short to get up for a 6AM PICK UP. We waited for two hours and were never picked up.ALL MR PONCE HAD TO SAY WAS OH I'm sorry I heard from the bell men about it. The office must have messed up. MY GUY HAD TO BASICALLY HAD TO DEMAND FOR OUR MONEY BACK. I FELT Mr. Ponce should have at least offered some type of compensation or complementary on behalf of Hotelbeds.The Bell Men were GREAT!!!!!! THEY showed more concern.I would never deal with Hotelbeds again.I rate Majestic High. I loved the resort over all.

<Content>Great Family Vacation! We just returned from the Majestic and it was terrific. It was the first time we took our six year old with us and was very happy with everything. I would go back in a heartbeat. The place is gorgeous and kept very clean. Everyone is wonderful and so kind. Our daughter went to the kids club and had a great time. Angelica was the best! She is so sweet and kind and really cares about the kids. I felt very comfortable knowing that she was taking care of our daughter. In the afternoon we all spent time at the beautiful beach or the great pool. We had lunch/dinner at all the restaurants except the gourmet and Taino. All of our meals were excellent. I don't know about all the complaints about the food. We ate at the Japanese restaurant twice. I had called ahead of time and emailed for reservations and when we checked in they did not have them and said you can't make reservations on the phone or internet but went out of their way to make sure we got in. The entertainment at night was wonderful. I might not have had my daughter at the men vs. ladies and couples shows but all the others were terrific. I've been to many other resorts and this by far was the best entertainment for an all-inclusive resort. From morning till night their is always something going on at the pool or beach...games, entertainment, cook-outs, we had a great time. All the service in the resort was exceptional. Never had a problem getting a drink or a refill and terrific service at the restaurants. The animation team is wonderful and really make sure everyone is having a good time. Francisco taught Spanish lessons and was and excellent teacher. So patient and kind, especially when clearly we were all poor students. My only suggestions would be to improve on our vacation is the privacy issue in the room, they need shutters or a curtain closing off the bathroom. Very tough if you are with your family. Also they only put two beers a day in the mini-bar which actually doesn't get really cold. They should stock it up, it is an all-inclusive. I really can't say anything negative about this resort.

<Content>Nice Hotel.......They Could Do Better! Having read the reviews before my trip, I feel it is my duty to write this review through my eyes. I will start with my arrival. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the staff and given our room keys. We were tired and hungry because our flight had a four hour delay. So we get our keys walk to our room, which is about 10 minutes away from the lobby and the key does not work, so we had to walk back to the lobby to get a new key because the maid would not let us in our room. That was so frustrating!!!The Animation Team is the best, they get everyone involved. If you have the opportunity to meet Maria, she is the sweetest woman! Restaurants - The main dining hall is great (great selection), the french restaurant is good, the seafood restaurant is the best and the japanses restaurant is good. Stay away from the mexican food and lunch time by the beach, too many flies, the flies go away at night because the food is not out in the open.Staff - For some reason, we never could get wash clothes and the maids dont clean your room, in my eyes they only make your bed. I used their shampoo and shower gel every day and the maid would leave the empty bottles in the showever everyday. We had to ask for wash clothes every day and we left $4 per day in the room (tip) and still she never could give us wash clothes, i had to go look for her every day. My mother made coffee every morning in the room and the maid would always forget to put more cream or sugar, it never failed. I think the staff at the Majestic just does not care. The manager in the chinese food restaurant, he was rude. I told him the soda was flat and he didn't believe me, he was not nice. The only time you can get good service is when the big boss's are around! You will notice who the boss is! One night we ate at the japanese restaurant and I had to ask for soda four times! The best waiter was Danny by the beach. Danny made sure that my glass was never empty. Again, the hotel grounds are clean and the food is good, however the service they provide needs improvement. The treadmill in the gym is broken and we were told the boss does not want to fix it. They show a movie every night, all of the movies skip on the DVD. They are old, you mean to tell me the Majestic can not afford a new treadmill and DVD's. Do not buy anything at the Thursday flea market, go outside to Punta Blanka. Its to the right of the resort, it takes you five minutes, you can get a better deal. Make sure you never pay the price that is quoted, you can get at least 90% off. The Majestic is beautiful because of its pool and beach, you probably can find the same at another hotel. There are a lot of children at the majestic, parents just leave their children to roam the resort, so you see the children, getting into everything!I probably would not stay there again, the service is poor!

<Content>Amazing...earned my vote A great time was had by all 16 of us of differing ages. Not even fellow stupid Americans could spoil it. Beautiful resort, accomodations and views...we faced the beach. Enjoyed the ability to walk off good meals. Enjoyed the infusion of spanish culture and tasty local foods in all areas...do not be afraid to ask for food to be prepared the way you like, this island makes everything well done. Met people from all over the world. Animation Team was excellent, especially water aerobics with Francisco...no guilt about not hitting the gym, I could work out in the pool and swim up after to the bar for a drink. Shows were great, there was enough variety for different age groups. Excellent value, best all-inclusive we have stayed at so far.Greg/Florida

<Content>Nice Place but needs improvements ... NOT child safe Let start off by saying I am far from a picky person. Give me some decent food and an amazing beach and I am a HAPPY camper. Im not critical at all and dont freak out of the little things bc not for nothing it is DR. The beach HANDS DOWN is the most beautiful I have ever been. Clear, warm, beautiful sand, a section to snorkel. I just loved it. You can walk and walk ... its a beautiful beach!The pool ... VERY nice pool in concept. Not well maintained. If you have kids that run around the pool ... bad idea. There are many pot holes where they can trip and hurt themselves badly. Its best to make they wear water shoes. The pavment is very uneven and is a hazard to kids. Some of the filters in the pool are not covered or are loose. The jet pool area dosent work on one side.Food ... PLEASE dont waste your time with the beach restaurant. I can eat pizza and wendy's when need be ... but this place is gross! It takes forever to get a drink  is infested with flies. Do yourself a favor DRY UP and go to the main dining hall for lunch but SERIOUSLY dry up bc they put a chair outside and make you sit to see if you have a wet bathing suit. There were a few idiots who obviously couldnt read the sign in english that said NO WET BATHINGSUITS. Restaurants ... HERE IS SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ... DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THE JAPANESE RESTAURANT. They make is sound to important/elite that they tell you that its booked for DAYS at a time. We got a reservation for 930pm and the food was SO average NOTHING worth waiting for. Hello ... they RAN out of SUSHI!!! How does that happen? The hibachi was SO average! If you can go ... ok but dont work around the reservation. They say men HAVE to wear pants ... I saw PLENTY of men in shorts and flip flops. Go to the Frence or Mexican Restaurant. I didnt think any of the food was exceptional. I thought it was pretty ok. Nothing I will strongly remember.This place is at best 3 - 31/2 stars. Def not 4. Sorry. The drinks are very watered down. Hard to get a FROZEN drink. When I was in Mexico in the beginning of the month there were plenty so it has nothing to do with the heat! Try the outside bar they make the best drinks. The one by the gazebo.The people are VERY VEY nice and VERY warm. Thats why I love this country. Of course you do find a few who are lazy with attitudes but thats 1 out of 5. If you have a problem with your room DO NOT GO TO THE FRONT DESK!!! They could care less! Go to Client Services!! By the internet cafe. They are VERY VERY nice and want to help to the best of their ability. Also the front desk manager is VERY nice and VERY professional. Their management staff is wonderful!!!!Rooms ... I cant give say one bad thing bc we had one of the nicest rooms in the hotel. BUT the average rooms are great in concept for a adult only resort but this is NOT CHILD FRIENDLY. The ONLY place you can change is in the SHOWER. There is NOTHING that closes off the room to change. No privacy when you use the bathroom. Whatever you do on the toilet ... everyone hears in the room. Its very stupid. If you have teenagers ... better get them their own room. I saw so many kids waiting outside the door while parents changed. The concept is idiotic for a family resort. All the rooms are like that LOL Its so stupid. GREAT for a honeymoon or couples. THE MAIN ISSUE ... CONSTRUCTION ... this place was RUSHED to be put together. Without a DOUGHT! There are glass units that fall on the FLOOR ... yes a tiled floor. Room service dosent know how to clean. Sorry. I found quite a few LARGE peices of glass on the floor. I took they to client services and said explain to me why this is on the floor with all the small children running around this place and I dont have kids but can sympathize. Our toilet seat was broke. WE HAD THREE BLACK OUTS AT NIGHT!!! Takes 30-45 minutes to get it back and HARDLY any emergency lights. I honestly dont care how quick this place was put together ... but you can see there is NO good craftmenship ... pointless to try to make it a four start. It dosent come close. The fountains that run threw the hotel are unfinished and dirty. You can see all the wires, the water ponds for decoration around the hotel are PLASTIC TARPS LOL ... Nice place when you look quick ... but really tacky.The shows are cheesy. The meet the stars ... tacky!!! The Michael Jackson ... tacky!!! The couples competiton ... NOT appropriate for young children to watch! I was cracking up but wouldnt want my small children to watch. The battle of the sexes ... tacky! They have to run out and get mens shorts, women's bras and before you know it ... we have a naked croud ... think they can come up with something better. The best to watch is the circus act it was AMAZING!THERE ARE A TON OF TOPLESS WOMEN EVERYWHERE. I personally dont care bc Im european but I mean A LOT! Some ... REALLY SHOULDNT be topless let ALONE wear a bikini. It kinds turns your stomach. Some people may have a issue with this. You cant hide from them.DONT buy ANYTHING in the resport! What a RIP OFF!!! Men ... DONT waste your time on cigars there! Go to the Bavaro Shopping Center BUT go with men and go in a group if possible. The hotel can get you the cab. ASK the price FIRST should be 8 or 10 dollars. Overall it is a nice place at first glace and a nice concept. They try to bring it to an upscale level but I dont feel that it meets the requirements. Im sure you can have a nice vacation here. I wouldnt go back ... at least it wouldnt be my first choice. I have been to DR 4 times. This place has a lot of people that are NOT my cup of tea. LOUD!!!!! LOUD PEOPLE!!!! No respect for others around them. On the beach, pool or restaurants. They drink all day and cause scenes. NOT my type of groud at all! And it wasnt one of two groups it was a sloo of them. Id rather pay more and have a peaceful vacation. This place attracks a lot of riff raff. No thanks :-) If you have the means ... The Occidental is my favorite to date in Punta Cana. If you have a few extra dollars and REALLY want a 4 star go there and try to get into the Royal Club ... they treat you like GOLD!!!!

<Content>True Paradise! My wonderful husband took me to majestic colonial for our honeymoon. We had a fantastic time! The food was great and the beach was amazing! We even got some special honeymoon treatment free of charge :) The Animation Team ( they are a group of young employees who interact with the guests) were a lot of fun and got us up and moving and participating in some really fun events. This a a fabulous place for a perfectly romantic honeymoon! We both HIGHLY recommend it!

<Content>Fantastisch!!! Majestic Colonial, Punta Cana. First time to the Dominican Republic. Been to Europe several times. Was there for my daughters wedding. Enjoyed the European Style Continental Breakfast Buffet. Fresh cheeses, cold meat, Super bread and rolls, etc. Steak House was our favorite restaurant for Lunch and dinner. Beach was real nice, and better than I thought it would be. Even my neighbor who does not like the ocean had to be dragged out of it. Denny the Beach Consierge was very friendly and provided some good conversation and Drinks along with his sidekick Marileni. Wedding was great. The staff attending were a pleasure to have there. Rooms were nice and clean. So all in all it was a fun time. Not everything is perfect. Had no phone for 3 of the 6 days, But hey, on vacation who needs a phone. 2 members of our party booked a deep sea fishing trip. Did not go well at all. Not a hotel issue though. Travel agency problem. Oh yeah I think my Post Cards are still in the mail box in front of the mini mart. Can you ask someone to check and mail them out. Been 6 weeks now. LOL

<Content>Nice Resorts, But Problems My husband and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial July 6, 2008 to July 13, 2008. Aesthetically, the resort is gorgeous, but it does have some problems. Room:We booked the Majestic Colonial Suite room. The room itself was one of the nicest rooms we have stayed in. We were in room 2117, which is on the first floor. There was a bottle of champagne and a plate of fruit in the room for us when we arrived. There is a jacuzzi in the room and on the balcony. You have direct access to the pool with your own cushioned lounge chairs so you don't have worry about finding a spot around the pool. You also have a little lawn in the back leading to the pool, and there are bushes separating the lawns, so you do have some privacy. Some of the reviews I have read said the bed was uncomfortable. The bed in our room had a pillow top mattress cover. Not sure if that was because we had the upgraded room or not. If you book the upgraded room, you get a breakfast delivered to the room on a morning of your choice. It isn't a full fledged breakfast. They bring, coffee, oj, another bottle of champgne, fruit, muffins. We went to the buffet afterwards. Room serivce is also free with the upgraded room. Only problem is that there really isn't much to choose from and the food isn't that good. The A/C did work well. Pool:The pool its very large and the temperature was always warm, some days a little too warm. It is about 4 feet deep throughout. There is a swim up bar over by the activites portion of the pool. Room Service:The maid did not come clean the room on her own the first 3 days. We had to call housekeeping more than once each time to have the room cleaned and to get clean towels. As the other reviews have mentioned, there were no washcloths.The mini bar in the rooms are supposed to be re-stocked daily. This also didn't happen. Again we had to call multiple times. My husband went to the concierge after the third day in a row of problems. After complaining, the room was cleaned and the mini bar was stocked daily.Internet:There is an internet room upstairs in the lobby. They charge $5 for 30 minutes.Restaurants:For breakfast, the indoor buffet is pretty good. They have a large variety of choices and a couple of cooking stations for made to order eggs. You can also go to the open air restaurant by the beach for breakfast. They have a smaller selection, also buffet. The food for lunch at the indoor buffet is very repetitive. The same foods were offered every day. Oh, and if you are wearing a bathing suit that even looks wet, they won't let you in. You will have to eat at the open air restaurant at the lunch buffet. The pasta station at both places is pretty good. The French restaurant is by far the best restaurant at the resort. We ate there twice during our stay. The French restaurant requires a reservation and guys must wear long pants, and shoes. The steakhouse and the seafood restaurant are the same restaurant even though they list it as two seperate restaurants. They just ask you if you want the steak or seafood menu. It is at the open air restaurant which also serves breakfast and lunch. We did not eat from the seafood menu, but the steakhouse food was pretty good. The Mexican/ Dominican restaurant was hit and miss. Two nights it was good and another night it was pretty gross. They do have a large salad bar/ buffet for appetizers. We did not go to the hibachi (requires reservation) part of the Asian restaurant, but we did eat at the a la carte part of the restaurant and it was terrible. I got sick from eating the food. For anyone who has food allergies, be VERY CAREFUL of the food at the buffets. Many of the foods at the buffet are not labeled so if you have any severe food allergies, don't eat anything unless you know exactly what it is and what is in it. They also use the same tongs to cook seafood and other meats so beware of cross contamination. My husband is very allergic to seafood. We went to the buffet for dinner one night and he ate something that must have touched seafood and got really sick. Drinks:We could never get a cold drink anywhere. The frozen drinks were never frozen, just slightly icy even though they are in a machine. The soft drinks were always super warm. I think the problem was that the dispenser didn't keep the drinks refridgerated. They stored them at room temperature and just put ice in the drinks which never got cold. Beach:The beach was nice. There were plenty of palapas, and we never had issues finding a chair. There is a big drop on the beach as you approach the water and the depth of the water drops a lot a few yards in. The water was very clear and refreshing though. Nightlife:The entertainment at the resort is pretty bad. The shows are corny. The Michael Jackson show is funny for a quick minute but after that minute you are ready to leave. They had a magician one night who was so bad people were just sitting there trying to figure out if he was performing a trick or just walking around. We gave up going to the shows after that. They have a beach party one night with a band, but that too is poorly organized. The casino is small. They have one roulette, black jack, and poker table, though the poker table was never open. The slots were ok, you can actually hit for a couple bucks on them. Every night in front of the lobby bar they have a table set up serving nachos, and other snacks. One night they had a smoothie hut set up - this was the only semi-frozen drink I had the entire stay. Overall, we had an okay vacation. We travel to the caribbean at least once a year and have been to Dominican 3 times now: Sun Village Resort in Puerto Plata; Grand Palladium Palace Royal Suites, Punta Cana, Jamaica: Iberostar, Rose Hall, Mexico: Aventura Spa Palace, Riviera Maya; Seacrets Excellence, Rivier Maya; Grand Palladium Resort, Riviera Maya. Room wise, this was the nicest room we have stayed in. With everything else considered, this was ranked at the bottom of our trips. The resort boasts that is it 5 star, but it really isn't. It is about a solid 3 star resort. When you travel as much as we do, you get a sense of what to expect out of a resort. This resort has potential, but we were disappointed. Again, aesthetically the resort is very nice, but the serivce is poor. For the cost of this resort you can stay at another place just as nice, if not nicer, and have 10 times better service. If you are not a sesoned traveller, and this is your first time to the Dominican, you will probably not be bothered with the issues . For those who do travel often, you should stay at another resort.

<Content>Loved this place! We spent 10 days on our honeymoon at this beautiful resort. The service was excellent. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The room was simple but very nice. Pool was huge and the beach was beautiful! Dennis and Marilem the beach concierges were very friendly and kind. The animation team did a great job. Overall we found the staff very personable ... Leo, Wilkin, Maria, Rolando, and Negro. There was a large variety of food which was all very good. I highly reommend this resort to anyone, especially couples.

<Content>Hands down, it was our best and favorite vacation!! Neither my husband, nor I, had anything to worry about, and neither should you! I am truly saddened by those who felt they had such poor customer service, because we felt quite pampered... :-)Our stay was July 19 - 26, and was it ever HOT! Never a cloud in the sky the entire week. We love hot, so we didn't mind, but were glad we brought plenty of sunscreen, we almost used up 3 bottles between the two of us... I must say that we had the most amazing vacation at the Majestic, and will ABSOLUTELY be back next year! We are already planning a two week stay with extended family. Our room was perfect, if you can get 2250, you will love it. Great view of the pool, and the ocean as well, can't go wrong with that! We could never hear anything outside of the patio doors once they were closed. And we were right across the beach restaurant, so that says a lot. The room was immaculate, the maids did an excellent job. The mini fridge was always well stocked. We left a note asking for more water on the first day, and every single day after that we must have had 6 bottles waiting for us, plus pop! The pool is like none other I have ever seen. It's the full length of the resort, and was NEVER crowded. You could probably put everyone who stayed at the resort in the pool and you wouldn't touch each other. So that really eased up the beach as well. The beach was never crowded either. We walked up and down the beach quite a bit and found that the other resorts' beachfronts were much more jammed with people. My husband and I really couldn't care less where we were, beach, pool, whatever, everywhere you looked was an amazing view. Which takes me to the grounds. The staff works VERY hard at keeping the grounds well manicured. My husband ran each morning around the perimeter of the resort, usually around 6:30/7:00, and would see all the workers dropped off ready to start the day. There was one morning they were spraying the bushes for bugs/mosquitos, we never had a mosquito bite the entire trip. At that time of the morning, they are cleaning, having staff meetings at the restaurants, all making sure we all would have the best vacation possible. I am so appreciative of their hard work ethic, most of them were there from sunrise to way after sunset. So, to tell me the service was bad, sorry. I didn't see it.There were so many options for meals, we couldn't possibly get to everywhere we wanted to try. Breakfast was incredible. Tons of food to choose from, I really can't think of anything they didn't have. Lunch, we always went to the beach buffet. Every day was amazing view of the ocean while we ate, we didn't want to go anywhere else! Never had an issue with any of the food there. There is a lot I can't eat due to allergies, but I ALWAYS found something. Dinner, you must make a reservation for the Japanese Restaurant, Matsuri. I could never eat half of what they gave there's that much food! I wanted to finish it because it was the best food there (the shrimp is to die for!), but couldn't stuff it all in! I liked the french gourmet restaurant, the chicken was very good. The seafood and steak restaurants were not bad, but weren't our favorite either. I chose food at the buffets that were cooked in front of you, for the most part. That way I ensured the temperature was good and the food wasn't out for too long.We're not the ones to ask about nightlife. We are up so early in the morning, that we were too exausted by the time the shows were starting. So, we never made it to any. But after dinner there was always two guys playing just outside of the main buffet in an open air stage area, one on keyboard and one on either an alto or soprano sax. The last night we were there, they had a full band with three singer, performing what I think were very popular latin songs. They were fantastic!I'm sure I'm leaving a million things out, but I will say this. I LOVED this resort. We have never come home so rested and relaxed, it could not have been a better vacation. BIG thank you-s to AnneMarie for always providing fabulous service, and for being there for any questions. I am so sad I didn't get to meet you! To Victor at the front desk, who was very accomodating and made sure we were happy. To Oscar at Matsuri, who provided great entertainment and fabulous food! I really wish we could have taken you home! And lastly to Victor at the pool bar!!! YEAH BABAY!!!!! He made every visit to the bar a great one, we looked forward to seeing him every day. The man LOVES his job!! If anyone has any questions at all, please feel free to private message me. I will do my best to help. I seriously can't stop talking about the Majestic, I might as well be of some use to all of you!! I'm still mourning the fact that I have to cook for myself, and CLEAN... just terrible... :-)

<Content>Service needs alot of improvement After arriving at the resort, I expected a welcome with some cool drinks at the check in. At the time of checking in, I had to ask the register if I can have a bottle of water and was told to go to the bar. Got in the room with no issue. The place is immaculate. The pool is so clean and different than other pools in the other resorts. A serpentine shape. The beach is so clean and well managed. Seat lounges are available through out the beach area.Tommy Filler:Food are just average. The same thing everyday unless you go to different restaurants in the resort.Entertainments:Nightly shows just OK for the kids. Nothing expectacular.Casino is too small.Disco is as small as my basement. You know what I mean.Services:This really needs alot of improvement. A couple of times the room maid took our used towels with out replacements. It took me 3 hour and 3 phone calls at the register before I got some towels. Also you don't get face towels if you don't ask for it.The mini bar I should say it's good, it's always replenished daily.Bar:You only get domestic drinks. When you ask for imports, these are extra. I was charge $6 for Grey Goose and raspberry drink. Imported beer is extra as well. No tequila shots at the bar.All in all, the stay is just OK. But the service really needs improvement.

<Content>Majestic Colonial Is Not Really Majestic Where can I possibly begin??The grounds are kept beautifully. The rooms however, are not maintained clean. You have to do lots of walking to get from point 'A 'to point 'B'. There is a big span in time where there is absolutley nothing to do.The people who entertain are friendly. There was a bartendar named Ernesto(Tiburon) who was very kind, cordial and made sure my glass was always filled.Thanks Tiburon!!The selection of drinks is minimal. You have to pay if you want any of the good liquor for it is not even included in the V.I.P. package ,which is what I had. In the evenings, the theater is so hot that it is virtually impossible to sit and watch the whole performance. The disco caters to the very young and the music is repetitive. There was one evening when I wanted to purchase a card to use the internet ( you have to pay) and two of the workers literaly argued with each other as to who would get the card for me to the point where I just said forget it and left. They were very rude and unattentive. The food overall is good, lots to choose from. Except for another evening when the waiter was very rude (in the seafood restaurant). He became annoyed when one of the people in our party of 13 asked for a double order of lobster. He bought half a lobster instead of the whole lobster that the other patrons in the restaurant received, and then he made us wait over 45 minutes to get coffee. Needless to say , we felt uncomfortable and very ill at ease. The prize for those who participate in any of the activities is always a bottle of liquor( brugal, ugggg) . They should alternate and also give out tee-shirts. I don't think that the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana will be seeing me or the people that I traveled with again, and unfortunetly, when asked, I will not have many good things to say about this particular resort. I actually feel that this year, I wasted my money and did not enjoy my vacation.

<Content>Great Vacation We just got back from the Majestic Colonial a week ago. This was the first time we went to an all-inclusive and it was great. There was always something to do whether it was at the pool or at the beach. The Animacion Team (Melvin, Leo, Pablo, Ive, Teresa, Sandy, Francisco, Bolivar, and Jesus) were the best. They would always try to get everyone up and do a competition and they knew our names within 2 days of being there. The food wasnt as bad as people have said and late night snack bar by the club was the best for a late night cheeseburger. The pool was huge, but would close at 6 which didnt make sense but whatever. The suite i had was good the mini fridge always had two beers in it and water. The bars were great especiall the upstairs bar in the lobby with Roberto, but the pool bar was always packed so it was hard at times to get a drink. In the end this was a great vacation and we had alot of fun.P.S. We beat the Animacion team in the beach volleyball tournament which was fun.MarkRahway, New Jersey

<Content>We Loved the Majestic; It exceeded our expectations!!!!!!! We are seasoned travelers traveling on average two to three times a year staying at more upscale resorts (Ritz Carlton, Fairmont, Hyatt, Marriott, Omni, etc. or the more upscale all-inclusive resorts or boutique resorts or we cruise) for the last 25 years. I have also traveled on business throughout the US staying at five star resorts in major cities. While rating this resort, you have to realize that the rating should be based on the type of resort it is; an all-inclusive in the Caribbean. Of course you cannot compare it to a true five star hotel in major metropolitan city. As an all-inclusive in the Caribbean, in our opinion, it is an absolutely wonderful resort and one of the best out there. We stayed at this resort from June 26th to July 4th and had a wonderful relaxing vacation. (We usually go to an all-inclusive once a year based on convenience and I have a teenage daughter who enjoys the all-inclusive experience.SERVICE:The service was EXTRAORDINARY!!! At times we actually felt guilty the service was so wonderful. Did we deserve to have anywhere from three to six people doting over us during breakfast, lunch and dinner AND THE BEST PART WAS THEY ALL HAD BEAUTIFUL SMILES ON THEIR FACES WHILE THEY WERE SERVING US. HOSPITALITY:Everyone at the resort goes out of their way to make your experience as wonderful as possible. You start off with a gracious welcoming from AnneMarie and her staff. As you have your first meal and your first drink, you are welcomed with a big smile from the wait staff and the bartendars.The first day we were at the resort we questioned whether the resort would be intimate based on the size. By the second day we felt right at home. I have to say that the Dominican people welcome you with open arms into their country and make you feel like you belong there. By the end of our vacation we felt like we were leaving family behind. It was all big hugs and kisses on our last day. Some of our favorite staff members are Claudia, Aura, Marisol and, Raphael in the main buffet and Angel, Massimo, Alejandro and Flaura from the downstairs lobby bar and of course AnneMarie and Madeline in guest services. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!LANGUAGE BARRIER:Many of the servers did not speak English. However, everytime a server did not understand us, they immediately asked either a Manager or a co-worker to come to our table and translate for them. We never encountered a language barrier because there was always someone around to translate our needs. CLEANLINESS:The resort is SPOTLESS. Believe me I am very particular when it comes to cleanliness. It is a very well managed resort and the management team is CONSTANTLY overseeing its staff. One of the policies that we liked is that they do not allow you to bring food out of the buffet area; therefore, they do not have guests leaving dishes all over the resort. Marisol does a great job in the main buffet making sure nobody leaves with plates of food.GROUNDS:The grounds are spectacular. The landscape architect did a phenomenal job designing the gardens there is such a beautiful variety of flowering bushes, fountains and statues. AT NIGHT THE RESORT TRULY BECOMES MAGICAL; the lighting design is unbelievable. Everything from the pool to the pathways to the fountains to the statues to the palm trees to the gardens to the building.... etc. are lit up.The lobby is beautiful and is filled with numerous comfy couches and chairs to relax in. Since it is an open air lobby, it can however be hot at times.ROOM:We were in room 2320 which was on the third floor overlooking the pool (Do not hesitate to get a room on an upper floor since the buildings do have elevators) We loved our room; we had a partial view of the ocean and a huge palm tree in front of our room that just swayed with the trade winds every day. There is a very large balcony that has two chairs and a table along with a clothes rack to dry your bathing suits.My daughter is 15 and privacy was somewhat of a problem with the room set up. Since the bathroom door was made of glass, she felt awkward. She corrected the problem by putting a large beach towel over the door; she also put one over the shower door. When she needed to get changed, she used the very large shower as her changing room. Before dinner my husband and I would go to the bar so she could privately shower.I think the resort should look into possibly providing some easily removable draping around the whirlpool tub to make the bath area more private. They could put the drapery up when a family was using the room and remove it when a couple was using the room.BEACH:We loved this beach. THE BEACH HAS CONSTANT TRADE WINDS THAT KEEP YOU COOL AND THE WATER IS NOT TOO WARM; THEREFORE, IT IS REFRESHING. The other thing we liked was that you could walk for miles on the beach and you never got too hot because of the trade winds.TIP: We found a great spot to sunbathe everyday. If you walk all the way to the end of the pool and enter the beach almost by the water sports, there is an elevated ridge about six to eight feet above the beach where there are wonderful trade winds and it is somewhat private and less congested. Just make sure you claim your spot between 8:00 and 9:00 because this is a coveted spot.Be aware that the water does have ledgerock in it; it does not however, have any small rocks. Also keep in mind that depending on how the current moves the sand; an area that five minutes before had been sandy may now have ledgerock exposed. As long as you are constantly aware of this, you will not have a problem. We didn't see any need for water shoes at all.The water current and waves also varied widely. Sometimes the current was quite strong and easily pushed you. Other times it was extremely calm. The water appeared most calm when it was low tide. The current also affected the clarity of the water. When the current was calm, the water was crystal clear; when the current was strong, the clarity was much less because of the movement of the sand.TIP: There was also pretty decent snorkeling right by the double buoy on the rope. The resort provides free snorkeling equipment.POOL:The pool is beautiful with numerous bridge crossings throughout the entire pool. There is also a swim up bar at one end as well as another bar at the other end. We found the pool to be a bit too warm this time of the year so we preferred to spend most of our day at the beach. Usually around 3:00 in the afternoon we headed to the pool. At this time of the day there were many shaded areas.PHOTOGRAPHERS:The photographers do a great job taking pictures. What is really nice is that they take their time and put you in numerous settings and positions to get the best pictures possible. They took about 10 different shots of my daughter with a white python wrapped around her body. I also watched them doing photo sessions with couples and with families.FOOD:Okay the all-important segment....FOOD. For an all-inclusive the food was great. Is it gourmet food? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Is it great food? ABSOLUTELY!!!!!!!. You must realize when choosing any all-inclusive resort that most all-inclusive properties do not have gourmet food. You also have to realize that you are not paying $100 to $200 a person for a gourmet dinner. We found the food to be very fresh (especially the fruits, vegtables and fish) and tasty.BreakfastThe breakfast is served in the main buffet from 7:00 to 10:00. They have everything you can imagine and more for breakfast. Some of the things we enjoyed: bacon (don't be fooled by the way it looks; it tastes delicious), croissants, fresh fruit shakes, potatoes (all of the potatoes are delicious and flavorful), lemon squares, churros and donuts (the donuts are not greasy at all), crepes, fresh fruit, orange juice. The wait staff continually fills your coffee/tea cup and provides you with fresh juice.TIP: To ensure your eggs, waffles, crepes, pancakes etc. are hot just ask the cook to give it to you straight off the grill rather than taking the items under the heating lamp. Lunch:We preferred the main buffet rather than the buffet at the beach. For convenience purposes we ate at the beach buffet twice. Some of the items we enjoyed there: spaghetti with olive oil and hot peppers, ham and cheese Panini, mussels Rockefeller (the mussels are delicious very tender and not gritty at all), paella, breaded pork cutlets and the many desserts. With regards to the complaints about flies, this statement is true. There were flies at the open air buffet. TIP: Find a table where there aren't any flies. We noticed that certain tables had more flies than others. We also loved sitting on the outside patio facing the ocean.Some of the items we enjoyed at the main buffet for lunch were: minestrone soup (at the pasta station), fried shrimp, mussels, all of the potato side dishes (they make wonderful homemade potato chips and homemade french fries), pizza with artichokes and mushrooms, breaded cauliflower, crusty French bread, large selection of vegetables (roasted red peppers, broiled tomatoes etc.), grilled mahi mahi, grouper, calamari, and shrimp. The desserts are also very good: coconut macaroons, apple strudel, flan.BE ADVENTUROUS AND TRY SOMETHING NEW. WE TOOK SMALL PORTIONS OF ITEMS WE WERE NOT SURE OF. SOME OF THE ITEMS WE LOVED; SOME WE DID NOT. BUT GIVE IT A TRY YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOOSE AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN.NOTE: Service at the open-air buffet and main buffet was outstanding. There was always a server replacing your old drink with a new drink. Your glass of beer never got warm.On Fridays DO NOT MISS the paella they prepare on the beach. It is filled with lobster, shrimp, clams, mussels and other fish. Although they have Paella every day at the buffets; this was the best prepared paella. TIP: If you like lobster and clams just ask to have more lobster and clams placed on your plate.Dinners:We made our reservations when we checked in for the gourmet and Japanese restaurant. Later in the week we decided we wanted to go to the gourmet restaurant again and did not have any problems getting reservations. We never had to wait more than five minutes at any restaurant to be seated.Gourmet restaurant - We ate here twice. We had the red snapper which was excellent. TIP: Keep in mind that most of the fish served at the resort is very fresh so it is usually a great choice for an entree. We also had the filet mignons which was very flavorful and enjoyable; it was not tough but it also did not melt in your mouth like a filet you would get in a NY steakhouse. Chinese - We also ate here twice. My daughter loved the self serve sushi station. The sushi they offered was salmon roll, salmon and cream cheese roll, California roll, vegetable roll, cooked shrimp, egg, and eel. For appetizers they had great spring rolls and chicken with peanut sauce. The entrees we enjoyed were chicken with lemon sauce and fish tempura (this was great; I wished I had some malt vinegar to go with it) The only item we didn't care for at all was the sweet and sour pork.Seafood - We also ate here twice. The shrimp and avocado salad and the lobster tails are delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!! The fried mahi mahi appetizer is also very good. All but one of the lobster tails we had were very tender. Please keep in mind that if you are not satisfied with any of your meals send them back. If your lobster is tough ask for another one. We never had a problem doing this. The wait staff were always very gracious when you asked for a replacement. They never had an attitude which was quite nice.Steak - We all had the chateaubriand which was very good (not as tender as I would have liked it but very good). Japanese - The shrimp and the chicken stir fry were very good. The filet mignons however was a little on the tough side. Prior to your main entree they serve your appetizer. The only problem I had was that they had two people share one dish of an appetizer. I think a better policy would be to have each person have their own individual dish of an appetizer. The appetizers were very good and consisted of sushi, spring rolls, vegetable tempura.Stomach Problems:We ate practically everything and never had any stomach problems. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BRUSH YOUR TEETH WITH THE TAP WATER. We have always used bottled water and never had a stomach problem. Although we never had problems I believe the resort should do the following: Put a sign by the bathroom sink along with bottled water explaining that the tap water should not be used to brush teeth.  Have Purel or another antibacterial lotion stand available at the entrance of all of the buffets. Ask each guest as they enter to kindly use the Purel before dining. The cruise line industry has been doing this for years and no one is offended by it. In fact I believe most people welcome this trend. They should also have antibacterial stations set up in the bathrooms.BAR SERVICEWe found that the drinks were not watered down at all! As with most resorts, the lobby bar does have the best drinks. The service at the lobby bar is outstanding as well as the drinks. We absolutely loved the Coco Loco and the Dirty Banana. What I really like about this resort is that they treat each guest equally regardless of whether you tip the bartender or you don't (As a side note we always tip). This is just another sign at how well this resort is managed and how they try to make everyones trip equally enjoyable.The only area which I believe needs improvement is the bar service on the beach which is very sporadic. Some days when you are on the beach you will have a server throughout the day. Other days there won't be a server in sight. The problem lies in the fact that the resort does not have a bar right on the beach. Management should really consider adding a beach bar in the middle of the beach.Here lies the problem: The beach is quite large and the bar at the restaurant can be far away depending on where you are seated. The real problem lies in the fact that if you want a drink you have to put your sandals on, wash your feet in the shower and then head over to the bar at the restaurant to get a drink.MAID SERVICEOur maid did an outstanding job keeping our room clean. Every day we had a new assortment of flowers decorating our room. On two occasions we needed towels; we just dialed 1001 and we received our towels within five minutes. We also never had a problem getting our mini fridge refilled daily.ENTERTAINMENTWe thought the Majestic had great relaxing music playing during cocktail hour. It was usually a jazz ensemble or a Dominican band. The shows in the main theater are your typical all-inclusive type shows. My teenager daughter loved going to them every night; my husband and I could have done without them. The theater itself; however, is quite lovely with very comfortable chairs. It is very easy to fall asleep in one of these chairs.Certain nights of the week they had karoke in the lobby and of course they had the disco every night at 11:00. They also had a small casino which was a lot of fun. We played Blackjack one night and doubled our money. My daughter also loved playing the slot machines.OUTSIDE VENDORSOn Thursday nights the resort has a group of outside vendors come to sell items ranging from mostly jewelry to T-shirts and art work.NEGOTIATE, NEGOTIATE, NEGOTIATE. All I can say is that you have to negotiate your price. We bought many items at 60 to 80% off the original price quoted. WHATEVER YOU DO. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE! This also applies to the beach vendors.Also, be aware of the vendor in the first booth. This was the only BAD experience we had on our entire vacation. Since he was the first vendor we dealt with we told him we would come back to purchase an item after looking at other booths. When we came back to purchase our item, he told us he did not want our business and to get away from his booth. He wanted to charge us $75 for an item that he had previously agreed we could purchase for $5.I went up to the front desk and they asked me to explain my situation to AnneMarie. AnneMarie went right down to the vendor with me and made sure that I got the item I had negotiated. Once again, Majestic went out of their way to ensure their customers are happy.CONCLUSION:I would highly recommend this resort to anyone and I truly look forward to going back to the Majestic. I did a lot of research before booking this trip, read both the good and the bad. All I can say is that our experience was all POSITIVE. Other than the vendor, we did not encounter any negative experiences. We loved the Majestic and it exceeded all of our expectations. The Majestic is a very well managed resort that is TOTALLY COMMITTED TO SATISFYING ITS GUESTS. The management of the resort as well as the staff go out of their way to make your vacation enjoyable. The Majestic is truly a service oriented resort.

<Content>Great resort, but needs some work This is a gorgeous resort but it does need to work on a few really important factors.The food there is good. It is somewhat lacking in variety and the staff can be unaccomadating or unusually strict. Definitely check out the restaurants. The French is very good but make sure to dress appropriately, the other restaurants are all good but I'd recommend getting there earlier as the food  service is generally better. The bar on floor zero of the lobby is the place to go if you want a good drink.The entertainment is excellent. Look for Walter, Melvin, Mariel, Teresa, and Ivelica- they are the dancers  hosts  really make an effort to get to know the guests. With the exception of magic night, the shows are entertaining, even if you find them a bit out of date or don't volunteer. Make sure you go early or you won't get a good seat!The rooms are gorgeous but keep in mind, they are styled more for couples than families. You may get an open bathroom, so be prepared! However, they are all gorgeous if inconvenient. The housekeeping was a bit understaffed when I went there, and though they did an excellent job the rooms could be done very late.The one area the hotel is lacking is customer service. During our stay we encountered many rude  unhelpful or overworked staff. A member of our party is fluent in Spanish, and she caught the staff several times speaking rudely when they thought they couldn't understand us. The shopping is also lacking, and the hotel gift shops are VERY overpriced and lacking in necessities.Overall it is a gorgeous place. I would recommend it for couples or weddings as opposed to family getaways. Also, keep in mind it is under construction as of now  that they need time to get all their kinks ironed out.

<Content>More than Happy We have just returned from a 2 week stay at the Majestic. Before our holiday I became addicted to the reviews on Trip Advisor. I was convinced that the food would be horrendous and we would all get food poisioning. The facts were very different. The Main Buffet was full of all sorts of food. The home made chips were to die for and there was always something to choose from. Both my Husband, Daughter and myself had the same food, only My Husband had a slight tummy problem. We put this down to the water in the hot drinks in the Restaurant as he is the only one to drink hot. Try to avoid that and I am sure you will be fine. Please remember that the Dominican 5 star is NOT an American, British or European 5 star. This is a third world Country and therefore you must realise that their 5 star will not be to your standards but believe me it will suffice. The grounds are beautiful and well tended. The staff are for the most part extremely friendly. We did tip but found that certain staff would respond to the gesture others would not, so we left it until the end of our trip to reward the most friendly and helpful of the staff. There was a certain Lady in the main Restaurant who controlled the bottom left hand corner who was wonderful and although she did not speak English we all understood each other perfectly. The rooms were not cleaned to our satisfaction but so what if there is a little dust??? My Husband used the gym on a daily basis and found the instructor Mabtibes Walter to be very competent and very strict in the use of the equipment, and a very helpful and pleasant young man. All in all a very proffessional set-up.Our Daughter enjoyed the kids club and we found Angelica to be very good with the kids. Our little girl missed her when she went onto her days off. The Animation Team were all very hard working and a lot of fun. Overall it was marvellous and we would not hesitate to go again. One last and most important point PLEASE PLEASE if you smoke do not leave your dirty butts on the beautiful beach. It is disgusting that the number of cig butts outnumbers the shells.!!!!!!!

<Content>I would never go back! I was there from July 12-July 19.First, the hotel and beach are beautiful. However, the hotel front desk managers are incompetent and have no idea of the meaning of good customer service. I had booked the 1 bedroom Majestic Colonial suite and they did not have it when I arrived. I was given a room that was 2 categories lower. Additionally, they never apologized for not having my room available when I arrived. They acted like they were doing me a favor by helping me at all.Also, we were not taken to our room. We were given verbal directions to the room and we were lost as the place is so big. Victor, the general manager would not come out of his office to talk with me. On 3 separate occasions he sent different managers to talk with me. I asked the mangers to tell Victor to come out and talk with me but he never did. They tried to compensate us with a massage for my girlfriend and myself but as we have back issues we told them that we needed a different form of compensation. It took two days before they agreed to give us a romantic dinner on the beach. When I asked them what the room difference was between the room I paid for and the room I was given, they would not tell me. I asked them how I could determine if I was being fairly compensated if I did not know how much the lower cost room was.After further questioning they told me the price was $30 for the two of us. However, the price of the room on their own web-site showed over a $150 differenceAs for the dinner, I do not eat Seaford so I was supposed to get a non-seafood substitute dinner. When dinner arrived I was given a Cesar salad with lobster, this had to be taken back and my girlfriend had to eat alone as the waiter on the beach had to return to the restaurant to get the chicken Cesar salad. Then the appetizer arrived, a fish dish. Again, I told them I can鈥檛 eat it and I was not given a substitute dish. Then for the entr茅e which was surf and turf, they just gave me 陆 of the entr茅e, the steak.One day we went back to the room and the card key did not work. We had to wait a while for them to bring us a key. When we asked them what happened to the lock they kind of blamed us and said you can鈥檛 store your key near a camera or cell phone. I told them that I did not have a camera or cell phone anywhere within 10 feet of my key and yet they never gave me an apology for the inconvenience.Mike - Astoria NY

<Content>Just o.k. The Majestic has very nice grounds. It was always kept clean. We stayed in jr. suites which were also very nice and clean. The beds and pillows were hard, but after a long day in the sun we fell asleep pretty quick. The staff was always friendly. The restaurants were very clean and attractive. The food for the most part was good. Everything seems to be second rate, compared to the american quality food. The drinks were the same story. The mixers were unknown and tasted bad. The vodka seemed to be the best alcohol choice. There was no COKE product, although they offered what they had as such. The bottled water was good. They have a construction project going on next to the majestic, an expansion I believe. If you do not want to be awoken early in the a.m. by hammers, drills, etc.... do not get rooms facing this construction.

<Content>WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE We stayed 7/07-7/16 and had a great stay. I emailed ahead to request building 2-3 and on a higher level. Well we were given a room in building 4 but on the 3rd floor. At first i was a little disappointed when we arrived to our room and our view from the balcony was the new hotel buidings under construction. I thought of requesting a new room but my husband enjoyed watching the construction and men working. It was actually entertaining. They do start hammering away at about 7am but you really can not hear the noise if the balcony door is closed. We booked the standard junior suite. We thought the room was great. Very spacious and no issues with privacy and the bathroom. I could see how some might have an issue with this but we are pretty comfortable with each other. I used the jacuzzi while my husband and son were out doing their thing. We all loved the huge walk in shower. Room service is not included in this room category but no big deal.We tried all the restaurants. Our favorites were Japanese-hibachi, regular Japanese, Gourmet, and the Steakhouse. We always had breakfast at the main buffet. Lunch we ate at the both buffets. If you are in beach attire during lunch at the main buffet they will ask you to sit on a chair. If the chair gets wet they will not serve you. That was funny to see. People would get angry and complain but the chairs there are upholstered.Really no issues with the food. Like I said we tried every restaurant and if we didn't like it we wouldn't go back to that one. We are not complainers and had the attitude, I'm glad I didn't have to pay for that.The chef at the Japanese-hibachi was entertaining. He actually put his apron and hat on my son and took him behind the grill. The different rooms would have matches back and forth screaming who had the best chef. You couln't see each other but it was fun.The casino was entertaining. Abot 40 slot machines and then some tables. We went evey night for an hour or two. We won a few hundred on the slots. During the early evening they would let my son in but after 8pm the bouncer at the door would enforce the 18 year and older rule. The brochure states 16 is allowed but there is a tiny sign on the door stating 18.The sports bar is directly next door. At night it converts to a disco. We would laugh at the kids trying to get in saying they were 18 but obviously not. Just was funny to see. It made me look back and think I must of looked that stupid at their age when I was trying to do the same thing.I tried the spa. The prices are the same here in New Jersey. I had the aromatherapy bath and massage for 85 minutes at $125 USD. I enjoyed myself and I think my sun parched skin appreciated it.The pool was nice. My husband and son enjoyed the swim up bar. I would float around and they would bring me cocktails. There were always chairs available. We we would go down to breakfast and put our things on the chairs and occupy them after breakfast. The towel game is in full force here but there is really no need for that. There are plenty of areas available. I just can't see waking up at the crack of dawn to reserve a seat.The beach was awesome. Just like a postcard. Again, always spots in the shade available. I prefer tthe beach but my husband and son always want to stay at the pool. We would compromise by splitting the day up with pool in the morning and beach in the afternoon. There is a beach waiter/concierge but didn't see him that much.There is at least one wedding a day on the beach. They really seemed to be organized with that. It was nice to sit on the beach and watch someone's wedding. Some couples opted for the live musicians and that just added a nice touch to the ceremony.Can't comment on the nightly shows. We never went. The shows are basically the same at any all-inclusive. They are kind like a high school musical. We spent our evenings in the casino or at the lobby bar playing cards or just socializing with other guests.My son was bored with us this year. So, next year we will let him bring a friend. Really can't blame him for being bored. He's 14 going on 30. What teenager wants to hang out alone with his parents for 10 days? I think bringing a friend would be great...it would give me and my husband some time alone.One thing that I forgot was that the bars do not have a cocktail menu or a daily drink special. That kind of bummed me out. You kind of have to remember from previous trips what you liked and see if they could make it. If not, just look around at what others are drinking and just ask what it is. No big deal though, but it would be a nice thing to have.Okay, if you have already booked, don't worry you will enjoy yourself. And if you haven't booked yet..what are you waiting for?Again, if you go with an open mind and are not a nit-picker you will definitel enjoy this resort.

<Content>Will Return We went as a group of 6. The grandparents, us, and our 2 children. This is the nicest resort I have stayed at. We received wet washcloths and the Majestic drink upon arrival. The shows were great, rooms fantastic, and service was the best I have ever received anywhere. We all enjoyed the food, and the shows were very good. I loved that there was a reef right in front of the resort, we snorkeled everyday and saw a great variety of colorful fish.We are returning next May with 6 friends for an adult vacation. We can't wait. We highly recommend this resort!!!!! Thank-you Richard and everyone at Majestic Colonial for such a wonderful vacation. If things remain at current standards we will return every year.

<Content>Amazing My cousins and I were there the week of 4th of July and we had a blast. We did not want to come back home. The place is absolutely gorgeous. Its right on the beach. The staff is friendly and more than accomodating. They really make you feel at home. The food was decent, some restaurants better than others. The entertainment staff is FANTASTIC!!! They had different shows every night and best of all they encourage the guests to participate. Kudos to those guys because they work so hard. I can't wait to go back.

<Content>Great TIme at the Majestic! We just got back from a family vacation at the Majestic. (We have two teenage boys...15  13). We were there for a week and all had a great time! The resort, pool, beach are all beautiful and well maintained. Yes, the rooms have a musty smell, but we were not in our rooms that much and after the first day did not even really notice it. Yes, the bathroom area lacked privacy, but like others, we dealt with it.....hey, we're on vacation in the caribbean - make the best of it! The food was good....we especially liked the Steak Restaurant! We also enjoyed the pasta bar at the lunch and dinner buffets. We've been to many all-inclusives and the Majestic's food is on par with other 4-5 star resorts.The service was very good. The gentleman at the towel hut was awesome and extremely friendly! Also, Marisol (she greeted us everyday at the breakfast buffet) was extremely friendly and told us on the first day that if we needed anything, she would take care of us. We had a minor request for her one day and she took care of us. If you need assistance, see Marisol.....she is very nice and gets the job done!We loved the Animation Team! They work very hard and made us feel very welcome! Leo, Francisco, Ivelesse, Jesus and the rest of the team were great! Thanks to all of them for a fun week!As stated above, we've been to many all inclusives in the caribbean and mexico and the Majestic is right up there with other 4-5 star resorts. Feel free to email us with any questions. Have a great time at the Majestic!

<Content>Beautiful - as pictured resort Beautiful -describes everything about this resort!We vacationed at this resort from 7/7-7/15/08 and had a wonderful time. Our family is parents and two teenagers, 17  19, both boys. We had two rooms that were next to each other. In building two. The rooms were 1st floor, Majestic Junior Suites. We loved the location and the rooms. Majestic Junior Suites are the 1st upgrade in rooms for this resort. They are pool front with your own grass back yard to the pool. The patio has two chairs with small table, two chaise lounge chairs and a Jacuzzi. The rooms were some of the biggest we have stayed in, for the money:) Bathroom was great for us, huge marble shower, king bed, sofa, coffee table, desk w/chair, room safe, good closet space, air conditioning in our room was wonderful, mini bar (stocked daily with 4 water, 4 soda, 2 beer), room also comes with bottle of rum  scotch. We have been to another resort in the Punta Cana, Iberostar, where the room key activates the air conditioning, not the case here the room is wonderfully cool when you return! This resort has a great beach! Beautiful white sand, lots of thatch palapa umbrellas, gentle waves, some rocky areas but mostly sand in water (we did not need water shoes), great snorkling (bring your own if you have it), long beach for walks, sand volleyball was lots of fun. We also took out catamarans, which you need to reserve in advance. Women have the option to go topless in the Dominican but there were only several at this beach, due to the mostly American clientele.The pool here was one of the best, it runs the length of the resort inbetween buildings 2 and 3. There are some busy parts, swim-up bar, and activity area where the animation team does group activities but in the pool in front of our room there were few people even though the resort was sold out. Bring a raft and float around!Also bring large insulated glasses, use them for alcoholic or nonalcoholic drinks on the beach or by the pool. The to-go glasses provided are are small, plastic and uncovered.Language problems? We encountered none! Most of the guests during our stay were from Miami, New Jersey, New York or London. The staff all speak English -except for the some of the maids and gardeners. This was a change from the Iberostar where most of the guests were French or German with some English. We liked that too though.Grounds were nice, Iberostar is better but it has been in operation longer, so everything is more mature. The staff at the Majestic work constantly on the grounds and they are nice but will be more lush as time goes by.The casino is great. It was small but adequate. We like to play BlackJack and there were almost always atleast two tables. Minimum bet is $5. Age for Casino is 16 and over.Our kids loved the Disco. We stopped by too. It was open from 11pm-4am and was mostly young people 17-25. If you take older teens be prepared to set guidelines. Alcohol is easily available. We had no problems with our boys but have traveled alot to Europe and other all-inclusives where alcohol is readily available.We also did the spa and golfed. Spa costs between $50 -$100 for most treatments. Golf is 5 minutes away and is $145 per person + $40 to rent gold clubs. Both were very nice.Food- This varies so much from person to person. We enjoyed it! The Supreme Buffet has a pasta station, pizza station, a grill (different selection daily) I had grilled salmon and grouper one day. Roast meats, carved individually (we saw beef, pork, ham , fish), salads, desserts, fresh fruit and more. Another review mentioned the delicious strawberry/bubble gum ice cream - we hated it and we hated the rum raisin ice cream too. This buffet is indoor and airconditioned:) And never crowded.The restauraunts we liked best were the Supreme Buffet, Restaurant Le Gourmet (ate there twice but you must make a reservation) had the tenderloin fillet and grouper, the Teppanyaki Japanese Cooking Presentation (make reservation immediately after checking in to resort). We also ate at the Matsuri and Rodeo Grill, both just OK to us. The Japanese Cooking is the hardest restaurant to get into, if you don't get a reservation sometimes if you just stop by you may get lucky - we talked to two families that got in that way.The boys both got a touch of tummy - surprise, you're in a 3rd world foreign country. The boys were told not to brush their teeth with tap water but thought they would be fine. They also ate ice cubes after working out at the fitness center. Be careful, pick up extra bottles of water to brush your teeth. At Iberostar they supplied each room with a gallon of water for the bathroom, here you just use the little bottles of water from the fridge, be sure to pick up more from bar for room. My husband and I were fine. And the boys problems were solved by taking two imodium immediately and another if needed later.Things to bring-Pool RaftsInsulated Drinking GlassesPepto BismolImodiumBug SpraySmall first aid kitsun screenWash clothWater shoes (optional)Febreze Spray (optional)Snorkle gear (optional)Room numbers: four digits 1st digit is building #, 2nd is floor #, and 3rd/4th is room #.In my opinion Building 2 is best, followed by Building 3, next 1 and finally 4 (only because of construction next door).Shows - We liked the Circus Show and Beach Party with limbo contest.Drinks- The Majestic is good (think orange creamsicle), dirty monkey (think chocolate/banana), my huband liked that stoli vodka was included. Lots of brand name alcohol is included, if you order some thing that is not included they will tell you that it is an additional charge (greygoose vodka was not included)I did get some mosquito bites at night (4) and found two in our room. I am a mosquito magnet. My husband got none and one son got 2 bites and the other none. Use your bug spray at night - I never saw them but they must be there! Side note I was not bitten at all at Iberostar, so they must spray more.We had one bug in our room during the 8 days that we were there. And no ants but then again we did not use room service so there was no food in our rooms... Maids washed the floors and changed the sheets and towels daily.Go enjoy! This is a beautiful resort! You will have a excellent time:) The Dominican Republic has some of the nicest beaches in the Caribbean and this resort has it all!

<Content>The fantastic Majestic!! Our family of six which included 3 couples stayed at the majestic and what a fabulous holiday was had by all. In particular the animation team were outstanding. They made the day times full of entertainment and ensure that everyone had a chance to be involved, in the many activities that were on offer during the day. They included: water polo, yoga, aerobics, sala dancing, spanish lessons, table tennis tornaments and even football (or socca) as the american's call it!All staff were extremely friendly and very forthcoming. The food was plentiful and very varied. Drinks were available 24 hours a day with amazing cocktails!In particular we would like to give a special thank you to the majestic anaimation team including: Teresa, Sandy, Walter, Melvin, Jesus and Fransisco (our favourite!) Without this team, our holiday would not have been as much fun. Thank you to the A TEAM!! hopefully see you all again next year!Love from the Londoners!! xxx

<Content>A Relaxing Vacation- A Great Time... Our stay at the Majestic was from July 10-18th. We are a family of four, plus my parents who are about 70.Upon our arrival we were greeted with cool cloths for our face, and a cocktail to drink. I thought this was a nice touch, and a great way to start a vacation. Check in process was easy and relatively quick. We were all in building 2, my parents on the bottom floor, (which they liked), and us on the 2nd floor. I had requested a room with two full size beds for the four of us, but apparently they were full, and we had to take a room with a king size bed, and a pull out. We slept three of us in the king bed, (as my kids, 11 and 13, girl and boy will not sleep together), for two nights until we could get moved two days later. We then moved to room 2242, which was a great location, with a view of the pool and the ocean, and most inportantly two beds.I thought the food was good, with a hugh selection. Of course it is different from home, but that is part of being in another country, trying new things and experiences. My parents on the other hand did not like the food at all, and had complanint and dislike for almost everything they ate. I think older Americans will have more difficulty with the food, especially if they have not traveled outside of the country much.Our room was great, very clean and roomy, but lacks privacy, epecially when there is four people sharing. The toilet was not a problem for us, and in other reviews I have read.The beach is AWESOME, and what we primarily went on this trip for. The water is very warm, (78-80 degrees), and we brought our own inflatable rings, and checked out boogie boards, and rode the waves for many, many hours. My kids loved this the most, as well as the spectacular pool. The pool was so warm, and it bordered on being hot at times. It is great for kids that don't like cold water. It was absolutely the warmest pool i have ever been in.Be careful around the chairs on the beach, (under the palapas), as my husband cut his foot on a piece of glass that was on the side of the chair. It required a visist to the resort doctor for disinfecting and bandaging, but thankfully no stiches. It did put a damper on the last two days of our vacation, as the doctor advised that he should not go into the water with the cut on his foot, especially the pool.Luckily, he had done all the activities like scuba, snorkel, and play numerous games of beach vollyball prior to the incident.Regarding scuba and snorkeling: really not the place to go if you want to see a lot of variaties of fish or corals. The reefs are just ok, as we have seen a lot better on other vacations. Also, the sea can be a little rough a times, which was a bit unnerving for my 11 year old, who was not very comfortable on the resort snorkeling trip we did, even though she is a very good swimmer.The swells were such, that on occasion they would go over the snorkel, and she would swallow water.This was a two hour trip, and was $35.00 pp. The boat ride out to the reef was fun, as we were able to see a lot of the coast on the way.I would like to extend a big Hello and Thank you to Marisol M. She was the most helpful person to us at the resort. She is the guest relations intern, and a super nice person. Sincerely cares about the guests, and tries to help you in any way she can. She is always pleasant, and smiles, and she was key in getting us moved into the room we had requested. She is most visible at the main buffet, as the hostess, as well as any other resturant that needs her. She is on site from morning to night, and it seems like she never has a day off. She's great!In closing, we had a great time, despite the few incidentals that happened, and would say keep an open mind, and just go with the flow, and you'll have a great time...P.S.- The lobby bar, and the beach bar had the best drinks. Swim up bar was poor, unless you just drink beer.

<Content>A great place to stay Stayed here for 6 days for a family event everything was very nice. The pool is fantastic and the beach is just steps away. The food is great at every meal, however, service had a few issues at the seafood restaurant one night. The all inclusive liquor may be slightly watered down. A great place to stay all the same.

<Content>A Great Vacation at the Majestic Colonial My family (husband, son 17 yrs, daughter 14 yrs) and I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Majestic Colonial. After reading some of the negative reviews, I wanted to share the wonderful experience we had.The Majestic Colonial was everything we had hoped it would be. The resort grounds are beautiful; the staff does an incredible job of maintaining the area. The room was was large and spacious. We had absolutely no problems with air conditioning, bugs, etc. Because I had done extensive reading abouf the hotel prior to booking it, I was well aware of the open bathroom setup. Just in case, I brought a sheet to hang up for privacy. However, the sheet was not needed, and even my teenage kids agreed that the toilet and shower areas provided enough privacy (occassionally, we did hang a towel over the toilet door). The beach was beautiful -a few rocks here and there, but not a problem at all. Each day, we arrived at the beach mid-morning and had no problem getting 4 chairs in the shade. The pool was absolutely gorgeous - clean and not crowded. Again, there was no need to reserve our chairs at the pool. After reading many comments about the food, my concerns were put to rest after our first night's dinner at the steak restaurant. While the food is not gourmet, it is tasty, plentiful and none of us experienced any stomach issues. We were not able to get reservations for the Japanese restaurant; however, we tried most of the others. The Mexican/Dominican was a big hit!We found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful. And, any attempt to speak Spanish is greatly appreciated. When we only received two bathroom towels on our 2nd day, we left a note in Spanish (thanks to my son's high school spanish) and requested 4 towels for each day we were there. The note, along with a few American dollars, ensured that we always had ample bath towels. Concerning beach towels, each time we exchanged our beach towels, we were greeted by the friendliest employee at the resort. Although we didn't catch his name, this employee was always cheerful, friendly and we all looked forward to seeing him each day. Overall, we had a wonderful time at the Majestic Colonial and hated to leave. Though we were there for a short time, it was by and far, one of the most relaxing vacations we've experienced!

<Content>Had a great time at the Majestic!! Stayed at the MC the first week of July and had a great time. I don't understand where all these complaints are coming from. The food was good in some places and very good in others.The beach and pool were excellent. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.Make sure you talk to Anne Marie, she is very helpful and a sweetheart! Me and my family had no stomach issues, we used bottled water in the room to drink and brush our teeth with, but the water and ice in the restauraunt was safe to use.I never had a problem getting a drink at any of the bars and the drinks were fine.The shows were cute,we saw all but one.Make sure you go to the beach party I think it's on wednesday nite, it was fun.We plan on returning to the Majestic next July, we had such a great time I won't even bother looking at another resort.Feel free to message me with any questions..

<Content>#1 all-inclusive With my family, friends and brother-in-law and his wife we spent 7 excellent days in the Majestic. The Animation Team was great, Ive, Nina and very specially for us Massiel. She make our stay there very beautiful and we hope she's good and we will see her again some time next year. The food in The Three Calaveras was A-1, thanks to Don Omar and his crew, they did make us feel like home. Rooms where in top shape, very clean. The live music was excellent. All the employees there are kind and very friendly. Were planning for next year. We will come back!!!

<Content>Thank God the negative reviews were over dramatized!!!! Don't listen to the bad reviews....the Majestic Colonial was very nice. We just returned yesterday after a week stay and I have to say that we were relieved after reading the reviews on this web site. We had a very nice time. Food - The food was above average as compared to an Iberostar all inclusive we stayed at last year in Cancun. We live in New York and are used to the great food of NYC and these restaurants, on the whole, did not disappoint. Of course some restaurants rated higher for us than others. Our favorite was the French restaurant, Le Gourmet. The food (especially the bisque soup and the filet mignon) was really good. We also had the grouper and chicken which were good. We ate here twice. The seafood (Tres Carabela) and steak (Rodeo Grill) restaurants were decent. As written in other reviews, the grilled lobster at the seafood restaurant and the chateaubriand at the steak restaurant were very good. These two restaurants are in an open air location on the beach and were a little warm the nights we were there. Our least favorite restaurant was the Dominican/Carribean (Taino) and I think it was purely because it was our first night, we were tired and the service was not very good. The food was good. Breakfast and lunch at the Gourmet Buffet was incredible. There is nothing that they did not offer. Everything was great here...fresh pasta bar, omelets, paella, hamburgers, fruit, soup, salad, etc. Beware that your bathing suit cannot even be damp to enter this restaurant for lunch. They do feel your bathing suit or make you sit on a chair to see if it leaves a wet mark. The security guard made at least one person from our group of 8 go back to the room to change each day. You cannot get one over on the guys. Lunch is also available at the beach if you don't want to deal with this issue, but the food selection does not compare. It's definitely worth drying off or changing. By the way, while we did not eat dinner at the Buffet restaurant, the food selection for lunch is the same as dinner. Also, the Japanese/Asian restaurant was also good. The tepanyaki side was fun and food was nice and fresh. The ala carte side was just OK.Rooms - alot written about the lack of bathroom privacy.....just go with it. We traveled with our 16 year old son and 13 year old daughter and we found ways around it. The room is so big that you don't even realize someone is in the bathroom. As far as showering and privacy...put on a cover up or the robes they provide to come out of the shower. Before we arrived, I thought I would be able to change in the shower area since everyone said it was so big, but the entire shower area does get wet. There was enough room to stand in the water closet and get dressed or you could open a couple of the closet doors and stand behind them. It was no big deal even with the four of us. On the whole, rooms were very large and clean. In contrast to a couple of reviews, we had wash cloths every day.As I'm sure you read, there are 4 buildings....1, 2, 3 and 4. They each start up near the lobby and extend like fingers to the beach. The pool is the second largest in the Carribean and extends the entire length of the resort from the lobby to the beach and is located between buildings 2 and 3. Unbelievable pool!General - Lobby/Piano bar was great. It was quiet, the music was nice and Roberto the bartender was great! He made a really nice champagne cocktail which the other bartenders could not make. The only champagne cocktail they knew about was a mimosa! While we didn't see or feel any mosquitos, we did get bitten. Bring some anti-itch cream. Again, not a big deal. Don't leave the balcony door open and you won't have any bugs in your room. I did not smell any musty odor as reported in some of the reviews. I brought room freshener just in case and did not use it. There were reviews about the rudeness of the employees. We did not experience any rudeness. However, they did not go out of their way to say hello. We were in Cancun for the two previous summers and the locals there are extremely friendly. Obviously, the Domincans are not as friendly as the Mexicans, but they were not rude. No one in our party of 8 got sick. The employees tell you upon arrival not to drink the tap water and don't overdo it on milk based food/drink because they use goat milk and not cow milk.....this includes pina coladas! We didn't even use the tap to brush our teeth..they provide bottled water in the room refrigerators. The only disappointment is that there weren't any waitresses taking drink orders at the pool. This is a family resort and anyone who is going there without children and then complain about the fact that there are kids needs to go to an adult-only all inclusive.We had a great time and were relieved that the negative reviews were over dramatized.

<Content>Great Vacation at Majestic, can not understand these reviews It's been about 2 weeks since we went to the Majestic and don't normally write reviews, but seeing so many negative comments I felt compelled. It was me, my wife and our 2 teenage boys( 15 and 18).We booked through Continental Airlines Vacation and was very happy doing it this way. We flew from Newark to Punta Cana non-stop. They contract with VIP services who were waiting for us right after we got the luggage. We had a private mini-van pick us up, as part of the package, and took us directly to the Majestic...no delay, no bus and no problems what so ever. Our check in was again flawless. We were introduced to Annmarie who is absolutely fantastic and could not do enough for us. What a great job she does...thanks to her for making our vacation extra special. We had 2 rooms in building 2, our sons on the 2nd floor, us on the 3rd floor. Nice view overlooking the pool.I do agree with some that the rooms were somewhat musty and the addition of a room deodorizer did little to help...but it is not bad at all. People are making way too much of this.I can not understand the comments with the bathroom...it is spacious and easy to navigate. Ok, so the toilet is behind a glass door...deal with it...you're on vacation. The shower is huge and fantastic for couples. We used bottled water for brushing our teeth.We always had enough towels...as a matter of fact, they kept giving us extra towels which was much appreciated...we did not even have to ask. The rooms were always cleaned by noon, except for 1 day where they were cleaned by 3pm. I must say I was very impressed how clean they got the rooms. Each morning I saw all the housekeepers ready to start their work day.Ok...on to the food.After reading the reviews on this board, I was afraid that we were going to either be sick the whole time or be so disgusted by the meals that we would not eat anything. This could not be further from the truth. First off people, lets be realistic...this is all inclusive. Anyone here eat at a all you can eat buffett in the US? Of course you have...and do you think that you need to eat everything on the buffett or everything needs to be perfect for you? That is an absurd thought...because buffetts are made to fill you up...not all are a gastric pleasure palace.Let me give you my real rundown on each place we ate:Each breakfast we ate at the main buffett area...this was very good and had a huge variety. Most lunches we ate at the same main buffett area...each day there were new items that made it interesting. We ate light for lunch and were never disappointed. Now...is the pizza like the stuff you find at authentic restaurants in the US...no it is not. However there was so much to choose from...I never had a problem...neither did my family.Japanese restaurant - very good and filling...probably way too much food and it was very tasty.French Restaurant - again, very good food and service was great. Steak Restaurant - excellent, ate there twice...never disappointedSeafood Restaurant - excellent again, ate there twiceNone of us got sick, had the runs or anything. We drank bottled water mostly. My wife did eat the salads and both my older son and me ate the fruits. The only stomach ache was eating too much food sometimes. So overall, these negative food reviews are without merit. We had some really great meals and again I was perplexed at the reviews. We did eat at 6:30pm each night and never ever encountered crowds. As for a comment I saw about flies in the outdoor restaurants...I laughed...I guess they have never eaten outside before. Where I live in NY...if you eat outside at night you need to fight the flys and mosquitos...I think these creatures are everywhere, not just Punta Cana.Ok...now onto the beach. Beautuful...no bugs like I read. We used repellent one day because I was paranoid from what I read...what a waste. We did not encounter any issues from bugs at the beach. The water was a bit choppy in the afternoon for 3 days...but you could still easily swim...the water was not as clear. On our last 4 days the water was very calm and was crystal clear. We snorkeled everyday off the beach and feed so many fish...it was like being in an aquarium. My younger son loved it and we snorkeled twice a day, at least. They don't like you taking bread out of the restaurant, so just put it in your pocket if you plan on feeding the fish. Oh...we never had an issue finding lounge chairs.The pool...super nice and fun. If I did have two negative comments... the concrete apron around the pool had a lot of potholes that should have been patched....it is sometimes hard to walk on the concrete in some areas. Also...they need to have more people cleaning up after the guests who drop their cups all over the place. I found cups all over the place. The staff does an amazing job at keeping everything super clean in some much of the resort,,,so I was a bit surprised that the pool area got a bit unkept by the end of the day.We went on two trips:Macau Crazy Wheels ATV tour...in a word....FANTASTIC. If you are looking for a real fun time...do the ATV trip. You will love it. Not going to spoil it for you...it is fun!We went on a snorkel trip too but I forgot the name of the tour. It was a lot of fun too and everyone enjoyed.They really do a great job at the Majestic and was very satisfied and felt I got my money's worth. If you are expecting a Ritz Carlton...stay home...you are not paying for that. You get great value at a super nice place. I would not hesitate recommending this resort.

<Content>honeymoon We stayed at the Majestic Colonial from june 29th until July 6th for our honeymoon. I have to say this was absolutely beautiful resort. I honestly don't think I have one single complaint about the place.Our room number was 4344 which had a view of the beach, and a jacuzzi on the balcony. The rooms was very clean, and beautiful. We had excellent service, from all the staff there. The bathrooms was private enough, I've heard other people complain about them but we dind't mind them. It's not like you can see through the doors or anything. The pool was very clean and very large. Not cold at all. Always plenty of chairs to pick from.Beach was beautiful, plenty of chairs, very clean beach. Plenty of shade if you wanted it. We only ate at 2 restaurants because The supreme had everything that we wanted there. We did eat at the steakhouse a few times and that was really good. We couldnt finish our drinks before they would come around and refill them. Everyone was soo nice there. The food was excellent, I think I gained weight I ate soo much. There was pretty much any kind of food that you could ask for at the buffet. I'm a very fussy eatter and I had no problems at all finding foods to eat. The shows at night were very intertaining. We went to all of them except one because we were too tired. I loved the michael jackson show. The magic show was probably my least favorite but I think the kids there enjoyed that one alot. Animation team did a awesome job. I dont think I ever saw any of them without smiles on there faces and dancing around laughing. Very friendly people. Absouletly loved this resort would recomment it for anyone and everyone and definitly will be back.

<Content>Was not thrilled with the resort I, along with 8 other family members stayed at the Majestic for 7 days. The resort grounds were nice. The pool was beautiful. We were only allowed one beach towel per person. The beach was ok, a little rocky and we were misled that it was the Caribbean waters, it is not. The room was big, but there was no privacy in the bathroom. Every day we had to ask for more towels. The breakfast at the buffet was good, but for the rest of the meals, it was just ok. The Dominican/Mexico and Lobster/Steak restaurants were very good. We had a 16th birthday party at the Dominican/Mexican restaurant and they went above and beyond. It was simply fantastic. I was not impressed with the night life at the Resort. Me and seven members of my family went on the Extreme Ranch ATVs, and the experience was horrible. The ATVs were very old and dangerous. I personally had to change vehicles three times along the route. The first vehicle had no breaks. The second one died along the route and the third one I choked all the way from the fumes. I believe the vendors who have space at the resort should stay on top of these excursions. The activities on the beach every day was very nice and I enjoyed them. I feel some of the staff at the resort were pleasant. This was my first time at this resort and at Punta Cana, and I have no intention of returning.

<Content>Big problems We were just there for the week starting July 6th. The resort itself is beautiful, food is typical for the islands, however the staff do not get the meaning of customer service. The language problem is huge unless of course you spoke Spanish. We had a phone charger stolen from our suitcase , this tells me the cleaners or whoever else had access to our room went into our bags to retrieve it. Yes I know it is only a charger however the point is they went looking for it. They need to learn from the Cubans on how to train their staff.I will not go back to the Dominican again, I paid lots of money for this trip and did not expect this kind of behavior from staff.I always give tips to people but not when a tip makes for better service or attention.

<Content>Beautiful  This place lives up to its name. It's very large and it's lovely everywhere you look. The beach is beautiful and if you're lucky, Denny the waiter/beach concierge will take your drink order while you sit shaded under a small hut facing the clear, blue ocean. He's very charming as is all the staff at the Majestic. Make sure you bring plenty of small bills because getting change for tips while you are there isn't very easy. There is a lot of food to choose from and even the pickiest of eaters will be able to find something they like. The breakfast buffet was my favorite. This is the perfect place to go to for a few days of rest and relaxation away from it all.

<Content>Mixed Bag at Majestic We stayed at the Majestic for 10 days late June into July. We'd had the trip booked since Nov. '07 to celebrate our anniversary and our first kidless vacation in 19 years. The resort was pretty busy, so I鈥檇 guess they were at full capacity.Disclaimer: I鈥檓 a bit of a germ-a-phobe, as I have been sick on vacation before.ArrivalYou will have to pay for a ten dollar 鈥渢raveler鈥檚 pass鈥?when you get there. You pay for the pass, are handed the pass, then you give it right back to them. It鈥檚 a little weird. If you get carsick easily, take some Dramamine before you get on the bus to the resort. Check in went smoothly but I was on guard the minute we arrived as I'd been reading the trip advisories. We had paid for an ocean front room and out of the gate, the front desk girl tried to deny this...we'd even had our travel agent confirm the week before. Alas, when I put my foot down and showed the paper work from our agent, she called over another girl who said the first girl had made a mistake, and of course we had an ocean front room! We were escorted to our room by a porter who spoke no English, but he still could communicate what we needed to know with gestures and pointing to signs. He was very pleasant. Our room Was oceanfront in name only...the view obstructed by the grass diving hut, and the other ocean front balconies that jutted out further than ours. This was the third floor on the farthest side of the resort, overlooking the neighboring resort. Rooms at the ocean front end of the resort are subject to a terrible echo factor that reverberates through the doors to your room, which have huge gaps around them. Staff and guests were very noisy in the hallways, and we could hear any and everything that happened in the alcove of the ocean front hallways. It is also quite a hike from oceanfront to the lobby.The bathroom set up provides little privacy鈥f you don鈥檛 know your roommate intimately, you will by the end of your vacation! :o) The shower was great鈥wo heads and lots of room.The patio jacuzzi took forever to fill, and it wouldn鈥檛 hold the water with a leaky drain.I was very uncomfortable in our room from the get go. The AC was hard wired to a supposed 20 degrees Celsius...I don't think it got any cooler than 78 degrees in our room. I could not use the bathroom mirror to get ready, as it was so hot in that area under the lights and eons away from the AC vent (we had a junior colonial suite). When we complained about it, we were told that the thermostats were set to go no cooler than 20, and there wasn't anything they could do about it. Therefore, it was truly disheartening to learn from another guest that his room was too cool, and his thermostat went down to 5 degrees Celsius. On the day before we left, we learned our neighbors had NO AC at all in their room, and Victor became involved. They actually had to change (very noisily) the whole AC unit which affected more than just our neighbor鈥檚 room...no wonder our room never felt cool enough!! And funny, after we told Victor that we'd been suffering in a too warm room, somehow our thermostat 鈥渢hat couldn鈥檛 be turned down鈥?miraculously was reprogrammed down to 18 degrees C on our last night.. but it still wasn't any cooler. The ventilation system there also needs a good cleaning. Of course there will be a mildew smell鈥t鈥檚 one of the most humid places on earth鈥ut an occasional cleaning of the air system would probably help the smell.Housekeeping was OK. The bed was changed every day, but what the heck is with the open-ended pillowcases??? That was very annoying. We squashed a roach in our room one day, and the carcass remained there on the floor until we checked out. There were also little blood stains on our drapes鈥leaning the drapes on occasion would be nice, too.We had a DVD player in our room鈥ut no DVD鈥檚!! Bring some movies that you鈥檝e been meaning to watch, because there are limited TV stationsFood:Enough has been said about the food, and I agree with the majority. Sometimes there was a delicious surprise, such as our experience at the Japanese Restaurant. If you have a late dinner at this restaurant, I would beware. Get the earliest slots available (6:30). We saw raw fish and meat sitting out at 6:30 that wouldn鈥檛 be used until later鈥?br/>and it was HOT in there! One guest that we met got very sick after eating the 8 PM sushi at the Japanese place. Try their version of Strawberry (Fresa) Ice cream鈥astes like berry bubblegum. Great coconut macaroons, too. I was very careful not to drink the water. We brushed our teeth with bottled H2O and avoided ice and poured water as much as we could. I avoided all raw fruits and veggies, and most seafood. I only had some minor 鈥淒鈥?on the second day, and Imodium cleared it right up. However, since the return flight home, I鈥檝e had 鈥淒鈥?since鈥? I have to see my doctor next week. Clearly, the practice of sanitation is far from what is the norm here in the states. One time we were seated in the buffet and the young man who seated us knocked a fork off our table鈥e picked it right up off the floor and put it right back on our table right in front of us!!!! The house beer, Presidente, was pretty good and well chilled (Praise be!)鈥nd we are picky beer drinkers.You might want to consult with your physician before your make the trip to DR鈥 think bringing a general antibiotic is a good idea just in case. ResortThere were lots of families at the resort, which doesn鈥檛 normally bother us, but it wasn鈥檛 a very relaxing or romantic atmosphere with a ton of kids running around, crying, and parents yelling, etc.. We were puzzled as to why the children鈥檚 section of the pool is down by the swim up bar??? Either way, we didn鈥檛 frequent the pool very much, as the beach was just too beautiful to miss. (Note: Hide your beach towels by the pool鈥urs was snatched and you can be charged up to $25 for missing beach towels). Do bring a raft if you go to the pool. The beach and the resort grounds, in my opinion, were the saving grace of the resort. Hint: avoid the 鈥渂end鈥?in the beach, as the current can be a little rough there, and you鈥檒l scratch your feet on all the rock/coral鈥nstead, head down to the beach area by the wedding canopy right outside the official 鈥渟wimming area鈥濃€here is a great place to swim in the ocean there without the hassle of the rocks under your feet. The water is just beautiful鈥arm, clear, perfect to just walk right in.The staff work very hard. We saw staff who were there from sun up to beyond sun down鈥nd all were friendly and always greeted us. We didn鈥檛 engage much with the animation team or the shows at night, but it was evident that they work their butts off. We tried to see the Michael Jackson show the one night, got there 40 minutes early, but still got lousy seats because people were saving rows and rows of seats for their family and friends鈥alf that didn鈥檛 even show up. Some people (guests) were downright rude about it. Hint: if you see a show, don鈥檛 sit in the back section behind the main aisle. People will continue to walk in front of you even during the show.We brought $100 in one dollar bills, as someone on this list suggested. We gave small tips to everyone during our stay. We were happy to do this verses go and gamble in the casino.Excursions:Saona Island on the catamaran was wonderful, but be prepared for a long ride to get there and lots of transitions (bus to bus, boat to boat), and peddlers. Our tour guide from Pietro Tours, Oscar, spoke 5 languages and gave us loads of great info about the DR during the bus trip. Bring towels, Dramamine, cameras, sunscreen, snorkel, dry clothes to change into for long ride home, and money for souvenirs at the 鈥渃igar shop鈥濃€oads of coral and shells washed up on the most gorgeous beach you'll ever see. The swimming area with the starfish was amazing!!The 鈥淐igar Shop鈥?has souvenirs that are half the price of what the vendors ask for on Thursday nights at the resort, and the pressure is not nearly as intense. They also have snack foods there. ATV鈥檚: This trip wasn鈥檛 worth the money or the sales pressure you鈥檙e exposed to beforehand. The poverty we saw on the trip, the dirty beach that we stopped at, the peddler鈥檚 harassing us, the children we saw begging, the machines that they provided were quite broken down (my husband had to adjust his foot clutch by hand)鈥t just wasn鈥檛 worth the 15 minutes of real fun we had on this half day trip鈥ou have to wonder what kind of bacteria, also, is in the water that you splash through on the muddy dirt road they take you down, which was bordered by lots of livestock and impoverished habitats鈥?If you do go on this trip, bring something to cover your right leg (calf), which will get fried from the heat of the engine on the ATV. Prepare to get filthy鈥ring old clothes and shoes!!!!HintsI found the hints on this site very helpful. Definitely bring insulated mugs鈥e saw folks there with the bubba kegs. Brilliant idea. Bring fresh sunscreen and mosquito spray for evenings鈥 was bit around the ankles even with spray (maybe in the room?)鈥o bring several wash clothes. Bring a little powdered laundry detergent to wash out your suits, underwear; whatever might get really skanky from sweat, salt, sunscreen. We used the Jacuzzi tub as 鈥渢he Punta Cana Laundromat.鈥?Just be sure your clothing doesn鈥檛 get caught in the jets! ] We regret not bringing goggle and our own snorkel and mask鈥here are a ton of lovely fish in the reefs/rock right in front of the resort鈥?br/>snatch some bread from the buffet to feed them鈥t is amazing what you鈥檒l see. If you dare use the snorkels and masks from the diving hut, bring some sanitizer and use at your own risk! They just pass them on to the next person after they are used鈥o cleansing from what we saw! Gack! Bring Purell and/or Purell wipes, and do as much of your own self-sanitation as possible. Bring a Tshirt, also, to wear under the communal life jackets from the dive hut. They reek!Do some research on the most cost effective way to contact home鈥ill you pay international roaming charges on your cell? Calling the states from the room was wicked expensive鈥 opted to pay $5 for 30 minutes of internet service accessed in the library off the lobby area. There are also books to borrow from this area, magazines and some newspapers to read...and it's one of the most air conditioned places on the resort!!If you plan to use your credit card, contact your card company first to let them know you鈥檒l be using your card in the DR. Some charges we made were blocked by our card company鈥檚 鈥渨atch dog鈥?service鈥?br/>Guys: Bring sandals, even if you are not sandal-wearers鈥hey are essential for those beach to bar to bathroom trips!!! LarimarI love jewelry, and was intrigued by this light blue stone that all the vendors were trying to sell called Larimar, or blue amber. I didn鈥檛 believe what all the high-pressured peddlers were saying, that it was a volcanic stone mined only in the DR. Indeed, it is a stone indigenous only to the DR and I could kick myself for not buying more of it, so if you are in the market for some unique Christmas gifts for the ladies in your life, buy some larimar jewelry because it鈥檚 unique and hard to find in the states. The vendors will likely meet your price once you walk away from them鈥o don鈥檛 let their guilt trips or semi-insults stop you from bargaining with them.DepartureThe lines at the Punta Cana airport were tremendously long (we departed July 3), and it was hot, hot, hot!! Even the 鈥渁ir conditioned鈥?section was miserable. Be prepared to stand in long lines, and you can bring your water right up until you go through the metal detector鈥o don鈥檛 discard it before then, like we foolishly did. There is still a chance to shop at the airport for those last minute souvenirs鈥e got a better price on a piece of DR artwork at the airport than they wanted at the resort. Don鈥檛 try to bring any fruit, vegetables, plants, snails, or mama juana!!! They won鈥檛 allow it.

<Content>can't wait to go back My husband  I, our 2 teenage boys, and my parents just returned from the DR and we can't wait to go back. The resort is absolutely beautiful, and the beach is everything you could want in a caribbean vacation. Denny and Marileni, the beach concierges, were outstanding, and Jesus was a great waiter every morning at the restaurant on the beach - bringing me my hot tea automatically just upon seeing me! Food was pretty good, ate at the Supreme buffet several times because of the huge selection. Only slight complaint may have been the hard time we had getting enough towels and washcloths, but that was a relatively minor problem. We were there for 7 days and never left the resort, and still weren't ready to leave! Don't really see how anyone would be disappointed we a vacation to this resort!

<Content>Animation Team Animation Team was excellent. I loved every single one of them. They work from 10 in the morning to 1 or 2 in the evening. They take care of you all the time. There is Walter ... probably the most funny guy... Nina... Teresa...Blaky...Jesus...Sandy... and others... they make you laugh all the time... so if you have nothing to do go on the beach or pool and spend every possible second with them...ps. Walter... I love you... :DDominika

<Content>Wonderful time at the Majestic We traveled to the MC with a group of 12. Six adults and six kids from ages 8-12. We were there the first week of July. Weather was perfect the whole week.Check-in was a breeze. We were in building 3. Annemarie made our rservations for dinner and then personally took us to our room. The place is just beautiful. Rooms were great. We needed maintenance once to fix our safe. They were there in 5 minutes and fixed it no problem.Our first morning we had a meeting with our tour rep. It was sooo helpful. She gave us tips on what to see and do. One BIG tip- don't drink more than 2 drinks with coconut oil. She said our systems aren't used to it. We followed that tip. She also told us where to shop. The plaza right outside the MC was really good. Bargain!! We paid 30% of asking price. We also scheduled two excursions : Caribbean Festival and ATVs. Both were awesome. They were half day trips - perfect for kids.We need to send a BIG thank you to Frances Jose Sosa at the outdoor bar. He was just awesome. We visited him every night. Always had a big smile for us- and a mama Juana. Mossimo at the downstairs lobby bar was just as great and really had the best drinks. We miss them both. Hi from Pennsylvania guys. Joe is still recovering from his Birthday!!Go see the Jamaican guy on Saturday and Tuesday night in the downstairs lobby. He does Karaoke. Funniest guy. Loved him.Kids Club- Angelica is the best!! We thought our kids may be too old for the kids club but she tailored it to their needs. She took them to the game room and played pool, chess and foosball with them. When they were done she walked them to the beach to us. She was so friendly and nice. We were sorry to miss her when we left. It was her day off .Angelica - Justin, Joey, Jake, Brandon, Nick and Jessica say hello. They had a wonderful time with you. You are the BEST!! We are hanging up the group photo of you all.Food - was pretty good. No we didn't like everything but we never went hungry. Try all the restaurants- they were good. Steakhouse and Japanese were our favorites. Breakfast had a lot of choices. You will find something. My picky 8 year old even survived- he just ate a lot of pasta and fries.Beach was awesome. White sand and beautiful color ocean. The one thing I do wish they had is a bar on the beach. I didn't mind walking to the beach bar but I think one directly on the beach would make this resort perfect.All the adults in our group had a little bit of tummy trouble by the end of the trip but nothing major. I do not blame the resort for this. I think we just overindulged a little bit. All the kids were fine. Just take immodium - works wonders.I would recomend this resort. It's beautiful, clean and very friendly staff. I was nervous about the reviews before we left. Don't be - go and have a great time. We did.Oh - and take lots of pictures. It's all you have left when you come home. I keep looking at them wishing I could go back.

<Content>Great Experience We decided to try a new location this year other than Aruba and we were very pleased with this hotel choice. The staff were very pleasant, the grounds were clean and tended to daily. The beach was awesome with plenty of palapas.We had the pleasure to stay at the presidential suite with two private balconies and a outdoor jacuzzi. Great party room!The restaurants were Ok...The Japanese was overbooked and we couldn't enjoy the hibachi. The French reastaurant was decent, but was abandoned after the sommelier sold us his wine chioce. The only positive we had was an attentive young waiter.The best experience was the Mexican/Domincan restaurant where we met Rafael  Milsolidia. They were very nice to us from picture taking to a little homemade backyard after drink (Mamajuana). Will send pictures soon!Breakfast buffet was outstanding, outdoor restuarant was interesting to say the least. The highlight in the cooking category was the paella cooking on the beach. Great experience. Will send picture soons!Very hot, but pleasant ocean breeze to balance the weather.All in all the week spent was a great time, would recommend this hotel to friends. Would go back again sometime.Our trip was June 2008

<Content>Great Value! Great Service! Food not Majestic My boyfriend and I went from June 2-7th and we had an AMAZING time. We were going to cancel the trip because we read some horrible reviews, but we decided to stay with the Majestic. We were very shocked because our check in was quick and they had drinks waiting for us. They even had people carry our bags to the room. When we got to the room, we were blown away on how beautiful and big the room was. The place was gorgeous. We felt like we were in a paradise. The staff always had smiles on there faces and were always willing to help. Everything was great, except for the food! You would think that at an all-inclusive resort, you would find something to eat. We aren't picky eaters, but we only found ourselves eating at breakfast. Breakfast was delicious. We loved the crepes and make your own omelet station. The best part was there were no lines. Lunch was disgusting. The food that should have been cold was warm and the food that should have been hot was cold. The best restaurant was the steak house. I only got sick when I ate at the seafood restaurant. We made reservations at the French restaurant and we were surprised on how romantic the restaurant was. The food was horrible. The Japanese restaurant isn't worth making reservations to see the show because they don't do any tricks and the food is horrible.I think that they should change the food and drinks and they would have a lot more customers coming back. We wouldn't go back because the food was that bad!! Liked:Beach, Pool, Customer Service/Staff, RoomDisliked: Food and Drinks

<Content>VERY ROMANTIC We just arrived from our stay at Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. My husband and I were there for a week in July 2008 celebrating our honeymoon. The hotel was advised we were newlyweds and had awesome accomodations for us. The rooms are spacious and have a jacuzzi inside. We opted for the oceanfront so we also had an outdoor jacuzzi. There are swim up rooms available which are convenient for when you are in the pool. The hotel does have a regal vibe with a grand lobby area, beautiful fountains and taino sculptures. There are about 9 bars, 7 restaurants, and 1 huge pool, that runs the entire length of the hotel. The staff is very nice and prompt with their service. The nightlife is great, the food is stupendous, and the entertainment is fun. I definitely recommend for families, romantic getaways, or young party-goers. My husband and I already decided that we want to return next summer for our 1 year anniversary.

<Content>so so I don't Know if other review writers have been to other All Inclusives, The hotel is lovely, the service is not that great, it seems as if they do not have enough staff atthe dif bars.The Dominican and the Seafood restaurants were the good, The rest of the restaurants were ok. The rooms were spacious, but the open room concept must go. Sections of the beach were rocky, we were misinformed that Punta Cana was on the Carribean side it is not. I rather go to Puerta Plata were there is a city to see. My wife and I was the only couple that wanted a king bed.Our other friends were not accomadated with doubles. We had a hard time changing them with the mgmt. I would not reccomend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Mixed review of Majestic My wife and I and 3 other couples stay for a week at the Majestic. We all had mixed reviews of this resort.When we arrived and went to our rooms we were opposite a major construction area right outside our window. We complained and stated we requested a room either ocean side or pool side. The room were very nice. After much discussion we were all moved the next day pool side.The resort is beautiful. The pool meanders through the resort and is beautiful. The grounds are well kept, clean and lovely. There are plenty of chaize lounges by the pool or beach. The beach was great.Now the food, we were all disappointed with the selection and quality of the food. Very few of the staff spoke english and sometimes it was difficult to communicate our needs. One night at dinner my wife ordered a beer and a bottle of hot sauce. What whe go instead was a beer with hot sauce in it. We were hesterical, but that was one of many examples of confusion from the waitstaff. All were very nice though. The food was mainly latin and not overly tasty. Some of the fish dinners were ok.The guest very 90% latin. We are far from racist, but it seemed that everything was geared to the latin guest, espically the shows and music. We have been to other latin resorts and the guest were a nice mix of people from US, Europe, Canada and latin countries. We were defiinetly majority.The drinks were watered down except in the lobby bars. They charged extra for Corona beer and top shelf liquor. At other resorts there was no extra charges.We did a catamaran trip which was a lot of fun and well organized. The guys did deep sea fishing and caugt a 50lb mahi mahi. That was fun. the surrounded area in Punta Cana holds nothing of interest. We did hire a cab for half a day and it was disappointing. Nothing to really see. In Puerto Plata there was much more to see and do, and we ate at a wonderful restuarant in town.We would not go back to the Majestic again. There are other places that offer more for your money. I think Mexico is a far better deal than DR and the staff is far more accomadating.

<Content>Happy with the Majestic! My husband, myself and three other family members visited the Majestic from 6/28-7/4. Prior to leaving for our trip I was in contact with the manager, AnneMarie, regarding our preferences for rooms. Upon arriving at the resort, Victor at the front desk called AnneMarie who personally greeted us, checked us in at her private desk, made our dinner reservations, and gave us a personal tour of the resort. She escorted us to our room, 2248, and it was a great location, closest to the beach with an almost full ocean view. Thanks AnneMarie!! It's important to understand the layout of the hotel and how the room numbers go in order to put in a request for a specific room location. Building 1 faces the hotel next door, building 2 faces the pool, with some ocean views. The 1st floor rooms in building 2 are the Colonial Junior Suites with slider doors opening up to the pool. Our other family members had these rooms, but never really utilized their pool access from their room. The only difference in their room versus ours, which was a Standard Junior Suite, was that they had a DVD player and a clock in their room. They would have preferred a room on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th floors. Building 3 also faces the pool but has no 1st floor pool access and building 4 faces the construction of their new hotel. Room numbers in all buildings go from 1 to 52? The higher the number, the closer to the ocean. For example, our room 2248, was in building 2 (represented by the first 2), was on the 2nd floor (represented by the second 2) and was room 48 (the last 2 numbers). So if you want a room closest to the ocean, ask for a room in the 40's or 50's. Our room was very nice, a little musty and the comforter had some mildew on it, but no big deal. After all, you are in a tropical, humid environment. We did have an issue with some bugs in our room, not an infestation of any kind, I just can't stand to see them at all, especially in the place where I have to sleep! I killed numerous mosquitos, a couple of roach looking critters, and many small ants around our sink area. You may want to pack some bug spray as well, we did get numerous mosquito bites in the evening, especially at the open-aired restaurants. We only had washclothes in our room the first day, but I had brought my own from home, so it wasn't a big deal for me. The hotel does provide shampoo, conditioner, bodywash and a good working hairdryer so no need to pack these. You also get robes and slippers.I have to say I was a little nervous about the food at the resort after reading some recent reviews. We thought the food was fine, but we did not eat any fruits or vegetables just to be on the safe side. Lunch was the hardest meal for me to find something good to eat. They do have a pasta bar and panini station at the poolside buffet which were ok. Some of our family members ate at the indoor buffet and said lunch was much better there, but I didn't want to trek up there everyday and have to change into dry clothes before doing so. Around 3:30, the poolside buffet restaurant does put out some pizza, nachos and cheese and other snack foods, so I just waited to eat those instead of having lunch most days. We tried all the restaurants for dinner except the main buffet. Food and service was usually pretty good. There were many weddings when we were there and sometimes their receptions were in the same restaurants that we were eating in. This was the only time service was not up to par, because the staff was overwhelmed at these times. The drinks were pretty good as well, my favorite was the Majestic (with Stoli!). Some top shelf liquor is not included so ask before you order if you're not sure. None of us got sick at all or had any major stomache issues.Entertainment was decent. There was a PG-13 movie every night in the sports bar which was good to kill time, and then at 10:00pm the nightly entertainment starts in the theatre. Shows were pretty good, though sometimes we were too tired to stay and watch the whole thing. Never went to the disco, but did go to the casino a couple of times, it was small, but fun. There is a games area and small gym across from the theatre, and also some shops. At 11:00pm a small snack shop opens across from the theatre for those with the late night munchies! The animation team at the resort does a great job. Everyday they had activities planned on the beach and around the pool. They were very professional, energetic and are hard workers, working very long days! On the beach there are many water activities, some for free, some not. If you want to snorkel, you can get free snorkel gear for an hour each day and go right off the beach. We saw lots of cool fish and didn't need to swim out very far. Bring some rolls out for them, and watch them really emerge!! By the way, you can get towels from the dive center located at the beach or at the towel bar, which is quite a distance from the beach. We didn't know this the first couple of days, but were happy to find out we just needed to go to the dive center which was much closer for us. Also, if you bring a float, they will blow it up for you at the dive center. One word of caution, keep your dead bolt on in your room when you are there. The housekeeping staff will knock, but are quick to enter your room if you don't answer right away. I like to sleep in and I found them knocking at my door every morning around 9:00am. If I didn't answer they tried to get in with their key, but if your deadbolt is on, they can't get in. There are no do not disturb signs. Supposedly there are sensors in the room to alert the housekeeping staff if you are there, but if you're sleeping the sensors do not pick up any motion, therefore they think you are not in your room. This was a tip from another trip advisor member and I was glad I listened. Overall our stay was very nice. The weather was great, the ocean and pool were warm, drinks were good, and staff were friendly. Keep in mind this resort is visited mainly by adults. There were some families with small children, but not as many as other all-inclusive hotels I have been to. There were many 20 something year olds there who got kind of rowdy, especially at the pool bar around 5 or 6 pm. By the way, the pool closes at 6:00, which is kind of early, but I think they do this because of all the weddings going on and having to set up for their receptions. Also, there were people from all over the world, many Europeans and Latin Americans, so there are topless sunbathers on the beach. If you go, you'll have a good time. Bring lots of sunscreen and tips for the staff. Enjoy!!

<Content>Loved it! The Majestic Colonial was one of the most enjoyable vacations I've ever had! The hotel and grounds were luxurious and beautiful, well-kept and well planned. The rooms were lovely, spacious, so clean! Although bathroom privacy was an issue - frosted glass doors on toilet room and shower with walls that don't reach the ceiling?! But that glitch was easily overcome as everything else was completely fabulous.The pool and beach were great. Comfortable enough to spend the whole day just lounging around! The atmosphere was fun and friendly all the time.Choices for food and restaurants were plentiful. We enjoyed many great meals and ate more than we should have!We came for a wedding and it was simply beautiful! It was the highlight of the trip and everything came together so well! This resort really knows what it's doing!The staff was wonderful - from the housekeeping, grounds keepers and dining room and bar staff! Everyone was very accommodating and had a smile or friendly word to share. The Animation Team was second to none! What great energy - and a fun-loving crowd. Gracias to Francisco for the Spanish lessons, for his friendly face and encouragement - he brought me out of my shell just a little! It was a vacation that I'll never forget!

<Content>Not sure what all the negativity is about??? I have never written a review before, but I feel compelled to now that I have read all the negative reviews about the Majestic before I went and have now been there myself. My one question to all of you who have written negative reviews would be: What the heck are you thinking? My wife and I travel to at least two all-inclusives per year and the Majestic would definitely be considered one of our favorites. We were nervous once I began reading some of the negative reviews on TA. However, all of our fears began to disappear the minute we arrived. First, AnneMarie came out to greet us personally. She then took us and our friends to the concierege desk to book the two ala carte restaurants. She then personally walked us to both of our rooms. The spanish/english barrier was definitely present; however, the staff do not take offense and most of the time apologize for it - even though I always felt that it was my fault. Let's face it - I am in their country. They never made us feel stupid or inadequate. In fact, most times, after they greet you they ask if you speak spanish or not. My favorite staff members by far are Felix and Wandy at the beach bar. Of course, they are probably my wife's least favorite as I probably spent too much time with them (and the mama juana - ha ha). They always seemed very happy to see my buddy and I each morning and then when our wives came up for lunch, they seemed equally happy to see them each day. All the staff was wonderful. Make sure you visit the crepe station at breakfast. Even if you do not eat them, the show is worth it and he is probably the most friendly of them all. The food is good - not great, but very good. We did not have any stomach problems or anything. The drinks were not weak at all. The beach was unbelievable, and the pool is truly one of a kind. We stayed at The Excellence last November in Punta Cana. It is adult only and very nice, but also another 40 minutes away. I liked talking to the people at the resorts on both sides of the Majestic. I would go back to both in a heartbeat....I had a blast and the staff was just wonderful. Feel free to reply or send me a private TA e-mail if you have specific questions - I will reply to them all. Honestly, I can not think of a bad word about the Majestic.

<Content>A wonderful vacation My boyfriend and I stayed at ths property Jun 27th through July 4th. From the moment we arrived we were in heaven. Check in went smoothly, and we were greeted with majestic drinks and cookies. Our room was located in bldg 2, pool side. This was the nicest room we stayed in compared to other all incluisve resorts we have been to. Amenities included a large jacuzzi tub, sitting area, and a mini bar. There was even champange and a fruit/cheese platter awaiting. Our only complaint about the room is that the toilet is not very private (like a bathroom stall). We gave each other privacy by stepping out on the balconly for a bit. The beach is also the nicest I have seen. Soft white sand with plenty of huts and lounge chairs. The ocean was nice to swim in, with little or no seaweed. Drink service from Denny on the beach was fantastic. He was pleasant and always returned with our order quickly. The pool stretched the length of the resort and was incredible. Bars by the pool are great. A special thanks to Victor, who was always upbeat and personable. The food at the resort was delicious. We enjoyed the main buffett for breakfast and lunch. Always plenty of choices. I didn't care much for the beach side lunch buffet, too crowded and flies everywhere. The restaurants were all great. The steakhouse, gourmet (loved the creme brulee dessert), and japanese were my favorites. The seafood restaurant was just ok. We are from New England so our seafood standards are hard to meet. We did NOT get sick from any food at this resort. Evening entertainment was quite good for all inclusive. The lobby/panio bar was a great place to socialize in the evening. A thanks to Roberto for always going above and beyond with his service. We visited the disco and casino once. Nice, but we didnt stay long as we were tired from a full day of acitivites (the animation team is outstanding here). This resort fully met my expectations and provided a vacation to remember. Thank you.

<Content>Majestic and staff are wonderful! We returned from our trip to the Majestic Colonial yesterday after spending 6 wonderful days . This was our second trip to Punta Cana and first stay at the Majestic. The hotel is beautiful and beach is great. I think the greatest asset of the Majestic is their staff. Everyone (except one girl who worked at the steak restaurant) was wonderful , friendly and very helpful. When you go to the beach look for Denny ( he serves drinks and workes the bar) . He went beyond to make our time on the beach great. YOU ROCK DENNY!

<Content>Worst Customer Service I've Ever Experienced I recently attended a destination wedding for a week at Majestic Colonial Punta Cana and I have never experienced worse customer service. Our package was all-inclusive, and it seems that the employees have the mentality of we've already got your money, so why do more. When we ordered drinks, we would regularly see our waiter chatting with other employees, sitting at empty tables, and basically doing anything but filling our order. The food is mostly buffet style and is covered with flies. Whenever I found something that I could eat out of the revolting buffets, it was always greasy, heavy, and had been sitting out for hours. The disgusting customer service is generally practiced by all the employees, from the bartender who would harass the women in the wedding party with lewd sexual comments whenever we were at the bar, to the management, who have perfected the tone of complete indifference to everything one says to them. This is by far the worst vacation experience you could have, so do yourself a favor and go to a hotel that appreciates your business. I will never go back.

<Content>Less Money, Good Experience Our decision to stay in the Dominican Republic instead of the Riviera Maya was an economic one. We were able to book two rooms in Punta Cana(1 for our 2 children 18,14) for less than the price of a trip to Mexico for one room. While we realized that there is far less history involved in the D.R. than in Mexico we relished the opportunity to share an all-inclusive vacation with our children. The Majestic was a grand resort with lots of open air. The use of A/C was limited to rooms and restaurants and other key locations. The gorgeous lobby was naturally conditioned with light breezes but never felt hot. One detriment of the overall trip was language. Spanish is the first and foremost of the languages spoken here. You would do well to be versant in Spanish. There is just enough English spoken by Majestic front desk personell to get what you need.  There are two restaurants in the resort that require reservations and you should absolutely book them upon your arrival. Le Gourmet was outstanding, a masterpiece for dinner. As far as the Japanese Steakhouse, we never got to experience it because after a full day of travel and unwinding we got to the concierge desk after 6:00 and were unable to book a reservation until the next morning even though there were 3 people sitting at the desk . Already it was too late for any reservations for our 5 night stay. I would make that a priority withany stay here.. The buffets are above average and usually can accomodate any eaters desires. We have 4 extremely different palates in our family yet we were able to find plenty to eat at all buffets. Another hint;if you go to breakfast before8 am, not everything is available. Also, after 9 am, it begins to get crowded and lines will form at the favorite stations. As far as the rooms, we requested rooms next to each other to be close to our children. Although they recieved our request, they do not place a high priority on them and will only accomodate if it is possible. Once again, language was a barrier in this matter. Our children ended up 16 rooms away from us and with only 1 king size bed. This was okay for the first night but I persisted with the front desk(3 phone calls and 2 visits) and was given my request on day 2. Just by happenstance, a couple 2 doors down had requested a King size bed and had 2 double beds. They flip-flopped rooms with our kids. If you are not a smoker, the kids room had a very strong tobaco odor. Most guests seemed to smoke. The accomodations overall were decent. I would not rate them outstanding by any means. They were slightly unkempt even after the housekeeping visit. But never to the point of unclean. The open bathroom area is something to get used to. The beds were firm. The deck looking out over the pool was a nice place for a respit.Sattelite tv helped us keep up with events happening in the states. In closing, I would like to reccomend a trip to the Majestic for either a couple or a family. Lots of either are there. Tipping is not reqquired but a couple of ones goes a long way. Bartenders and the waitstaff are especially appreciative and will remember you on your next visit. The beach was one of the most gorgeous places we have ever experienced, especially on the horseback riding excursion off the resort at Rancho Carribeno.(35/person 1/2 day well worth the money). I would return to this resort in the future.

<Content>Majestic is the word - Not perfect, but pretty close Our vacation was short, 6 days. Our flight from Newark was a little over 3 hours, uneventful. We landed in the Punta Cana airport and it was a breeze getting our luggage and finding our travel shuttle. Our air conditioned mini bus was comfortable and our guide was informative. 45 minutes later we were at The Majestic greeted with a delicious drink called The Majestic and a cool face cloth. At check in we had our only snag. Our Jr Col. ocean front room was not available we tried a Majestic suite which was ocean view but after we saw the room we were back in the lobby. After 20 minutes of Franklin and Rene checking, a solution was found and we were offered the Majestic suite for that first night and the jr col. oceanfront for the rest of our stay with a comped' couple massage at the spa for our inconvenience. The majestic suites are different, the amenities are not as lavish as the jr col oceanfront. We had champagne and mini bars in both rooms, but the selection was greater in the jr. col. suite. We also had fresh rose petals flowers in our jr. colonial. After this snag our vacation was PERFECT. The room was awesome, the beach was clean, the pool was scrubbed every night. The staff went out of there way to accommodate. We had fresh wash clothes and towels. Our mini bar was restocked daily too. The food is okay. The steak house had great steak the first night and okay on the third. The spanish restaraunt was pretty good and the buffet was very good. Lunch at the steak house is okay, but it is close to the beach and we ate light anyway. Be wary of uncooked vegetables, take the skin off fruit and limit your pina coloda's majestic drinks to 2 a day. We had no problem with our stomach's but we were advised of the above and we are just passing this on. Keep in mind these are not 5 star restaurants, but the food is okay and there is a selection. The selections do not change, but you can vary what your eat. If you tip, give the tip to the person you want to get the tip. The cost of living is high and wages low, natural temptation is there. Keep in mind the dollar was worth more last year than this year, so the people are actually getting less. (Not unlike the USA...)The staff is fabulous! They are tripping over to make you comfortable. As I mentioned thanks to Franklin and Rene for the room change and to Kaila at the front desk too. Henry and the animation team is amazing. Although we never made it in the pool, the team never stops. These people are at the beach and pool the hours they put in are amazing. The beach was clean and we had great seats under a tree. No need for the towel game although some feel they had too. We just laughed at those people. Denny on the beach was our drink runner and he always had a smile. Mosquitos were not a big problem, we used bug spray 2-3 nights, but it was not like it sounded. I've gotten worse at the Jersey shore and OBX. The language is Spanish, not English, but I never felt there was ever a barrier. We brought a spanish english dictionary but never opened it. The staff is out working o the grounds at 5:30 and it seems there are always people around to serve and help. We saw beautiful weddings and unlike other hotels, the beach area where the wedding is is roped off and guards on the water line to prevent beach walkers from walking behind this once in a lifetime event. This is not everywhere, as I am probably in two coupe wedding pictures from other resorts not realizing I was walking behind a wedding. Check out the ATV adventures they were fun. Catamaran is free but tricky. The Majestic is not perfect but very close to it. If you have a problem, work with them and they will make it right. We can't wait to go back. We are already looking at our calendars.

<Content>Great Value! Great Service! Great....EVERYTHING! Booked this resort in December through Cheapcaribbean.com! I became worried when all the poor reviews (mostly with the food) started coming in the last couple of months, but it was a great deal and we were excited to go. Our trip was June 24-30. The drive to the hotel is about 30 minutes. Our transfer was booked through cheapcaribbean and provided by Turinter Tours. The van was air conditioned (thank god!) and all was well. Check in was just as described: cold, mint scented towels and a non-alcoholic majestic (their signature drink). The service at the front desk was AMAZING! Everyone spoke English. We felt like we were celebrities by the way we were treated. Our room location was PERFECT...building 2, ground floor...with direct pool access! We were located in the building farthest from the beach, but it is close to most of the restaurants and nightly entertainment. NO musty smell in our room. It is VERY humid here and I believe that the musty smell gets better when you turn on the A/C. I brought my own pillow due to recent reviews and I used it, but I am sure that I would have been fine without it. The bed is not a pillow top (like we are used to)...it was kind of hard. Our fridge was restocked everyday and maid service was friendly. Calls to guest services requesting towels and a new remote were fulfilled immediately! The grounds, pool and beach are AMAZING as everyone has reported! I was most suprised by the entertainment staff and variety of things to do. Saw the Michael Jackson show which everyone raves about and it was pretty good. The casino was fun (not smokey when we were there 11-12pm). Near the snack restaurant (open late) there is a place to play pool, chess, checkers or even rent movies. Near the swim up bar it is loud and more of a party atmosphere, but down the pool a little bit (it is THAT BIG) is a different world....you can sleep or just relax by the pool. We saw families of all types....20's and 30's, newlyweds, family w/ young children, fams w/ teenagers, empty nesters, wedding parties/family reunions etc.FOOD: To begin with, I must say that we DIDN'T get sick! Never took Pepto or Immodium! The people we saw at breakfast, lunch and dinner seemed satisfied with the food. Breaskfast was great....they pretty much had everything you can imagine! I had french toast most days...my husband had omelets. We did try to get to breakfast kind of early (before 9). The main buffet closes breakfast at 10 and it is really crowded after 9:15 and they have trouble keeping up with the demand for omelets and some of the dishes. At 10:30 they open breakfast down by the beach, but it is difficult to keep the flies out since it is an open air restaurant. The flies weren't any worse than your typical 4th of July cookout. I have a sweet tooth and the desserts were AMAZING!! really....really.....AMAZING! We ate at Taino (mexican/dominican) and Rodeo Grill (steakhouse). The service at Rodeo Grill wasn't very good and neither was the food...although we DIDN'T order the Chateaubriand because the service was terrible and they rushed us and I just ordered the chicken. Taino was OK, but nothing special! We don't like Japanese so we made both of our reservations at Le Gourmet! It was GREAT! The first time we went in we were given a menu in Spanish and the waiter acted like we were crazy we ask him to tell us what some of the stuff was! We were so confused and just ordered something and it turned out great! For the appetizers...we tried the martini with salmon....not my favorite......for next course I had the Pumpkin soup and my husband had the Lobster soup. They were great. For dinner I had the chicken and he had the steak....delicious! For dessert (my fav) I had the Creme Brulee! soooo good! Our second trip there we got menus in English....so that helped a bit....but we still ordered the same things! I think that pretty much covers it! Here are some tips for those planning a trip! 1. Pick the Majestic! We saw a couple of other resorts (Riu, Bahia etc.) during 2 excursions and Majestic looked by far the NICEST! I just really don't think you can beat the price of this resort. Look for a good deal through cheapcaribbean or other sites! Not sure what the prices are now, but we found a great deal by booking in Dec. (6 months in advance). The staff is great (especially those in guest services/public relations...AnneMarie) 2. BRING ALOT of SUNSCREEN and BIG SPRAY! It costs ALOT to buy it there and the 2 of us used an entire bottle in 5 days! I only got 2 bites but I put it on 3 times a day. 3. Don't exchange for Dominican Pesos....there is NO reason to! 4. If you buy internet access for your room be aware that the timer only runs when you are logged in. I bought 5 days worth of time ($50) because I thought the timer run continuously once you logged in. You only need 1 day (24 hours) of time ($10) because the time only runs out when you are actually logged in and surfing the web. The best part was that they refunded me the $40 for the hours we didn't use! 5. Be wary of drinking too many drinks with Coconut milk (CocoLoco, Majestic, Dirty Monkey, Pina Colada, etc.) because we were told it is a natural laxative. Could contribute to stomach issues....? 6. Bring comfy shoes! The flooring throughout the resort is marble, tile, hardwood and there is a fair amount of walking depending on your room location! 7. FINALLY....they will NOT let you into the main buffet if your clothes are WET! You CANNOT wear wet trunks into there. I am pretty sure that the information give when you check in states this....don't even bother trying to get in if you are wet. We saw many people mad (including my husband :) when they were turned away for having wet clothes. The hostess is just doing her job when she asks you to change. The seats have cloth cushions and I wouldn't want to sit in a chair that is soaked by the person before me! So, that is pretty much it!

<Content>Happy Honeymoooner's at the Majestic! My husband and I went to the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana from June 16, 2008 through June 21, 2008 for our honeymoon. We were so excited when we showed up. Checking in was not bad at all they were all so nice. Our room was gorgeous for a couple. Not a family. Everything was open except the shower and bathroom. The jaccuzzi tub serparated the bathroom from the bed. The room was sparkling all over because it was so clean. The bed was made up with flowers on it and so was the jaccuzzi tub. We had a room that had pool access and near the buffet by the lobby. It was a little loud at night until 11:00 because the one bar outside, but it still wasn't enough noise to bother us. We also had the jaccuzzi tub outside the room that we didn't use because the bugs outside. I woke up every morning with bug bites all over my legs so take some bug spray. The pool was excellente. We had such a great time. There was a bartender named William there. He was the nicest guy and the best bartender. He treated us like we were royalty. The pool closes at six so that sort of stinks, but we went there every night before we went back to the hotel room. The beach and ocean were so pretty. Take a banana or a roll with you when you go out to the ocean and walk up near the reef and break little pieces off and the beautiful fish surround you in a matter of seconds. I was fascinated by them. There was alway senough chairs and tiki huts to sit. You really didn't have to race to the beach to get them. When you sit closer to the resort you get waited on by the bartenders so that's nice too. The food was okay at the resort. I am quite a picky eater so I am not the person to be telling you this. First, if would like to go to the Le Gourmet under the looby make reservations the moment you get to the room. We did not get to eat there because they were booked. The buffet near the lobby was pretty good. There were some things that you had no idea what they were marked or not. Breakfast at this buffet was the best that we found the entire time that we were there. It was all inside so there wasn't a bad case of flies everywhere like at the buffet near the beach. The steak place near the beach was great. I am not a steak lover but the filet mignon was the best I ever had. Watch out for a couple of the waiters and bartenders when they try and get you to try some of there drinks. We had a drink called the MamaWanna and they said that is the dominican viagra. The other was the tequila boom boom which wasn't bad if you like tequila. The rum was excellent down there. The Majestic with a shot of rum was the all time best drink that I have had. We did two excurisions while we were in Punta Cana. The Saona Island Tour which I would highly reccommend to anyone that goes to Punta Cana. We had sucha great time. Then we went on the four wheeler tour. Don't waste your time or your money. Not worth it at all. If I were go back to Punta Cana I would stay at this resort again. Only advice to you: Brush up on your spanish. They speak some English but not very well. Be careful at the airport when returning home. They pick you up from the resort like 3 hours ealry but you need about two and a half hours to go through everything. The airport was a little scary for me. Just make sure youhave your passport and airline tickets ready to go. They are not so patient at the airport.

<Content>Fantastic Resort The Majestic is an absolutely wonderful resort. The staff bends over backwards for you and if you can't have fun here, I don't think you can have fun anywhere.After 15 hours of traveling, we finally arrived at the Majestic. The front desk staff checked us in right away and then the wonderfully polite and friendly Angela took us over to make our dinner reservations. She then personally escorted us to our room. Wow, what a room! We had a banner on the door saying Happy Anniversary,  champagne, fruit, cheese, and beautiful towel art by the tub. The room is huge and sparkling clean and just beautiful. I had requested a room near the beach and on a high floor and we got room 2328 which was a little farther toward the beach than half way and overlooked the pool and we also had a little ocean view. The AC worked great and there was no musty smell. It was perfect.I left a note in the mini-bar asking for only beer, water, and diet pepsi and that is what I got the whole week. I also left tips everyday for the mini-bar stocker and the maid. After a few days when the maid figured out that I was using the jacuzzi tub every night, I was greeted with a bubble bath decorated with flowers every night when we came in from the beach. I didn't ask, the maid just did it. You must use the tub, it is so relaxing. I was in it every night. What others have said about the water closet is true, there is not much sound privacy, but you can't see through the frosted door. It really isn't that much of an issue unless you are standing right next to the door. It was just my husband and I and I personally liked the open bathroom, especially when I was sitting in the tub and could talk to my husband wherever he was in the room. The bathroom is so pretty, it was nice to be able to see it from other areas of the room. It just made everything seem more luxurious to me.The bed was fine. Much, much, better than a lot of hotel beds I have slept on. It is not a fancy pillow-top, but it is still very comfortable and we had lots of pillows. My husband and I slept very well. The grounds, the beach, the pool, the restaurants, the lobby, everything is beautiful and well-kept. There is always something going on at the pool or at the beach. I took a few exercise classes and dance lessons and had a lot of fun. We snorkled right off the beach and I was surprised at the variety of fish and sea life. We were going to do a snorkling excursion, but figured why bother, when the snorkling was good just steps from shore. There were also kayaks, boogie boards, and Hobie Cats that you could use for free. The water activiteis hut also offered a lot of excursions. There was so much to do or you could just do a whole lot of nothing. We never had a problem finding beach chairs or pool chairs under palapas. One day we didn't get out to the beach until 11:00AM and there were still a ton of open chairs and palapas. In fact the entire resort did not feel crowded at all and according to Annemarie, the manager, the resort was at 92% capacity.Speaking of Annemarie, she held a Tripadvisor meet and greet and she was so nice. She is a very intelligent and well-educated woman and she really cares about making the Majestic a wonderful resort and making all of her guests happy. I am so glad I got to meet her and thank her personally for the great room and the wonderful service we were receiving. She asked us what we liked and disliked about the resort and I could tell she was really listening to us. I think the Majestic has a gem of an employee with Annemarie.We went to all the shows and they were entertaining. We especially liked the men vs women show and the Michael Jackson show. They also have a huge beach party on Wednesday night which was really fun. We never made it inside the spa or to the gym so I can't comment on that. We did go to the shops and the souvenirs were reasonably priced, but sunscreen, snacks, and that kind of stuff were very expensive, so make sure you bring your own. We also walked down the beach to the beach shops which is about a 45 minute walk. I didn't really enjoy shopping there because the vendors are extremely aggressive and when you try to haggle with them they act insulted or something. I love to bargain and haggle and both parties usually leave the deal smiling, but one of the vendors was pouting and actually said as I left that I had ripped her off. I was a little insulted because she didn't have to sell me the item at the price I asked for.The food was fabulous at Le Gourmet and at the Teppanyaki restuarant. We had the chicken and the snapper at Le Gourmet and it was soooo good. The food was very good at the Rodeo Grill and the buffet. The pasta and the french fries were delicious. They also have the best ice cream. The food was just ok at the Taino. I love spicy Mexican food and the food there was really bland. We told Annemarie about that and she was very receptive to making the food better there. We ate lunch every day at the beach restaurant and there were a few flies, but what do you expect outside. The food for the most part was good. There were some strange items, but I just didn't eat them. the service at all the restuarants was great.Overall we had a great time at the Majestic. The staff is just wonderful and will do anything for you to make you stay special. There is something to do almost every second of the day if you want, or you can always find a quiet place to just veg. The food, 90% of the time is very good and you definately will not go hungry. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone going to Punta Cana.

<Content>Wonderful All-inclusive We just returned from our trip and were very pleased with the accommodations of the Majestic Colonial. Upon arrival, the staff greeted us with cold wash clothes to refresh us. At check-in, Annemarie came out and explained things to us and took us on a personal tour of the grounds. We were very pleased with the surroundings and the personal attention we received while we stayed. The pool was huge and we never had trouble finding loungers even though the motel was completely booked. The beach was clean, the sand was powdery white and we could always find chairs there also.The buffet had many choices and the nightly menu was varied. One night there was Italian and one night there was sushi. We ate at the specialty restaurants for our dinners. We were very pleased with Matsui. One night we did the Japanese where the chef would cook your meal in front of you. All our food was excellent. We ordered a combinations of chicken, beef for one person and shrimp and salmon for the other two. We also went to the area where you did not need a reservation and the food was excellent. The pork and chicken chow mein were the best. My daughter had the Sweet/Sour chicken which she raved about. The Taino restaurant was also very good. There was so many varieties of food on the salad bar that when your entree came, you were full from the salad buffet. I had the Three Musketeers, which was medallions of chicken, beef and pork. The meats were seasoned just right and very tender. Our other meals from the Taino were also wonderful. We also ate at the Tres Carabella, which has steak in one part and seafood in the other. The service is very fast and the steaks were tender and done to perfection. I am not a seafood person, so I ate salad at the seafood place. The others had the grilled lobster and a seafood pasta dish, which they thought were very good. The Gourmet Restaurant was nice, but not our favorite place. We had the Chateaubriand, which was excellent. The presentation of the food was very nice. The dress code was very relaxed, which is nice. We did dress up because it makes eating a special ocassion for our family.Our room was in Building 2 and we had a wonderful view of the pool area and ocean. We did request the building after reading the reviews from Trip Advisor. We contacted the Majestic after reserving and requested that building. Our request was honored, for which we were very pleased. Our room had two double beds, a couch, coffee table, desk, a large armoire, with TV, large closets and area to put your non hangable clothes. Our lanai was large with a table and two chairs. We brought out another chair so we could all enjoy the view.We loved the Lobby Bar in the upper level. Our bartender was Roberto, who was very cordial. He was gone for the last three days of our stay and we were sad. The other bartenders at that location were also very accommodating. With the entire motel being booked, we never had a problem getting drinks, reservations at the specialty restaurants, or pool or beach chairs. At the beach, you were never bothered with vendors. We did notice at other resorts down the beach, there were many vendors trying to sell their things.Our room was cleaned before noon and fresh flowers were on the sink and in the towel animals. We had the turn down service at night and that was completed by around 8:30. There were also thick terry robes for us to use. That is something you cannot bring with you, as they are heavy and bulky. It was a nice touch and that made me feel pampered.We would highly recommend this motel to anyone.

<Content>Great time at the Majestic! I have never posted a review before but feel I must this time. We are a family of 4 and just returned from a glorious week at the Majestic. Even our teens had a great time and were in awe of the beauty of the hotel (anyone with teens know that is a major endorsement)! The beach is beautiful - very wide sand area with lots of chairs and palapa's. The water is so crystal clear you can see your feet. The pool is huge and also has lots of chairs and shady areas. It is not very deep (maybe 4 feet) and I recommend that you bring some floats if you can. The swim-up bar was always the place to be for socializing but if you prefer a more quiet place that is easily found as well. The Animation team have games and activities at both the beach and pool areas if you want to participate - they do not push if you are not interested though. The staff at the resort is amazing - we never had a complaint and always felt well taken care of. In fact - they go above and beyond the normal and made us feel very special and important. AnnMarie is wonderful and did so much to help make our stay memorable - if we lived closer I would want to become a friend! We were concerned about the privacy/bathroom issue since we were traveling with 2 teenagers and we only had 1 room but when we arrived we were taken to the most beautiful suite with 1 king bed (in seperate bedroom) and 2 single beds had been brought in and set up in the HUGE living area. This was the perfect solution to keep us all together but not too together....... Lots of talk lately about the food and we had absolutely no problems at all. Never had a stomach issue - not even a growl! We ate in the steakhouse, seafood, Dominican, roomservice, buffet and the Japanese and enjoyed them all. My daughter doesn't eat meat so the made to order pasta at all the buffets were her favorite (and the cheescakes). My son LOVED the sushi. My husband loved the buffet so he could eat all he wanted. I loved the steakhouse and highly recommend the chateaubriand! There was always ice cream available for dessert along with a variety of cakes and fruits. I do not understand how so many people have such harsh words about the food - it is easy to find something you like and with so many options you can't possibly go hungry! The drinks were fine and the bartenders sure work hard. Try the Chocolate monkey (they also have a non alcoholic version for the under 18 crowd). We saw a few of the shows and they were entertaining - not Broadway but enjoyable. The casino was small and smoky but a fun way to blow a few dollars before the show. My son enjoyed the nightly movie in the sports bar a few times - it was a good place to meet up with his new friends. The resort seemed to have lots of younger children (under 10 years old) and lots of newlyweds but less families traveling with teens. We walked to the shopping plaza just outside the hotel and purchased all our souveniers there - it seemed like the prices were better than the resort shops. The Thursday night vendors who come to the hotel were much too pushy for my taste so we didn't stick around to browse. I think I covered everything but if you have any questions feel free to ask.........Remember to bring a ton of sun screen - lots of red bodies parading around the pool (mine included)!Again a special thanks to AnnMarie for making our trip so wonderful!

<Content>The "Real" Majestic Colonial Experience ***Read before you go!!! I just got back from the Majestic Colonial with my wife and wanted to let everyone know about the place before they go. I really appreciate all the helpful hints before I go somewhere. When you first get off the plane you will notice that they have a line to take your picture with tropically dressed women. You have no choice put to have them take your picture (so smile)since they will not let you in without it. This picture will be available for you to purchase when you leave to go home from Punta Cana. I bought it for $8 US when I left. Then you will have to wait on another line to pay for your tourist card which everyone must purchase for $10 US each person. You must have cash since they do not take anything else (A way for the country to make money). Make sure that you have your transportation booked to the hotel before you get there. We used Club Caribe through Expedia. They were awesome. The best I have ever used. They had a guy holding a sign with our last name on it. He then escorted us to our bus. Everything went really smoothly. The trip to the hotel is about 40 minutes. When we arrived at the hotel I did not realize that my wife had e-mailed the manager for a better room. I asked how our room was and told him I would give a big tip if he gave us a better room. He told us that we already got an amazing room and if we did not like it he would switch it. The front desk guy had to go in the manager鈥檚 office to get our room information since my wife e-mailed him. I tipped the front desk guy $20 anyway and he walked us to our room and let us know everything about the hotel. Before you go to the room you are brought over to the reservation desk for the two reservation only restaurants. Our room was about a 3/4 mile walk from the front desk (no joke). Keep in mind that this resort is huge. When you first walk in the room you will be blown away. There is a giant hot tub for two in every room next to the bed. There is a giant walk-in marble shower with two shower heads. There is no separate bathroom so I don't think this is a good place to go unless you are a couple. The toilet is next to the shower with a frosted 3/4 length door. Not much privacy! The room is huge with a balcony. They also have a free security safe which you must use. They will also deliver a cheese platter and Champagne right after you arrive the first day. The biggest necessities you need to bring are BUG SPRAY  Sunscreen with bug spray in it. This is so important because the climate of Punta Cana is very humid and there is mosquito鈥檚 everywhere. We had read this before we went so we had minimal problems. You have to be careful not to leave your door open or sliding door open on the balcony. They will come in and eat you alive all night. The food really is not that great. We tried all the restaurants. The buffet by the lobby is the best by far. It is the biggest buffet you will ever see. The desert is the best part. The Chinese restaurant is so-so. Do not eat the sushi. It is sitting out all day and you must be crazy to eat sushi in Punta Cana. The steak house was pretty good. We did not try the seafood one because we where already sick after the first day. The buffet by the beach is gross because there are flies everywhere. The only good think about this buffet was that it serves breakfast until 12:30 PM. Ordering drinks is a nightmare unless you want a beer or Majestic (Signature drink of the resort). The bar tenders and waiters do not speak English so they will look at you like you have 4 heads if you ask for anything else. That was our biggest disappointment of the trip. The beach is huge and we never had a problem getting a chair under a shady palapala. The hotel was 99% full when we stayed. The water was really warm and was easy to go into without cold shock. You must be prepared for topless woman because they are everywhere. The pool is huge. The only thing is there are never any shady chairs available by it unless you go later in the day. But who really goes to the Caribbean to sit by the pool. I would recommend this hotel to couples who want a relaxing vacation and are easy going. There are some hitches along the way but the good far out ways the bad. They also really appreciate tips. They go above and beyond and really appreciate it when you tip them.Travel Hints:You must pay $10 US / each person to get into the country (paid when you get off the plane)Bring some sought of stomach medicine (Anti- Diarrhea). Everything is cooked with oil, and I mean everythingThey do not speak good English at all so you might want to get a translation dictionary.Bring at least 20 singles for tips. E-mail the manager of the hotel before you arrive any you will get a better room. (Ask for 3rd floor with ocean view /pool view on the left side of the resort away from the construction) Right side of resort is undergoing MAJOR construction since they are building a couples only resort. This is also a must if you are celebrating an anniversary or honeymoon and they will give you a great surprise when you get to the hotel. I will not tell you what it is so you will be surprised.

<Content>WONDERFUL RESORT Resort was fabulous. The amenities, the food and the staff were all wonderful. The resort itself is beautiful, very clean and well kept. We enjoyed a beautiful ocean front junior suite. The only slightly negative things I might mention were 1) that the ocean front rooms were somewhat removed from the main lobby, theater, and most of the restaurants. A bit of a walk to those amenities. If you prefer the beach front, then it's a small sacrifice. Secondly, I think the beach front wait service could be a bit improved. Not many wait staff available on the beach front on most daysHighly recommend this resort even the entertainment was quite nice. (Do keep in mind, this is not Las Vegas entertainment). Full range of meal options and quality food choices with friendly service everywhere. I would definitely consider a return trip.

<Content>Loved the Majestic!!! We had a wonderful time at the Majestic!! 24 of us went to attend my daughter's wedding there. Larissa did a great job of getting us ready for the wedding, and the wedding itself was beautiful! How could it not be with such a glorious, tropical setting. They were married on the beach and it was perfect! I was a little disappointed that they did not get a room upgrade, given that we had paid for the wedding package. All of the rooms were lovely , however! Thanks to Denny who took very good care of us on the beach!! Denny, you're the man!! Also, Victor was an awesome bartender and was always ready with our favorite beverage and a big smile!! Food was great!! We had some of everything and no complaints!! The animation crew were incredible, to have half of their energy!! The pool was positively awesome. We were told that the resort was full, but we never felt crowded, and we never had to wait for anything!! Overall we had a great time and would go back to the Majestic in a minute. Several of the people in our party have travelled to many other all inclusive resorts, and they overwhelmingly felt that this was a wonderful destination for a very reasonable price.

<Content>No question... Go with majestic colonial Where do i begin? This hotel was extremely beautiful. I loved this hotel. I wish i could have stayed- not necissarily just because our trip was all inclusive and we could drink and eat all day, and the rooms where outrageous, and we got these chocolate bars in our room everyday... but mainly because the staff was so nice. The majestics staff was like no other people you will ever meet. They will bend over backwards for you. Only the most anal, angry person who will never be happy could be dissatisfied with the staff. I do suggest that you learn some spanish though, if you havent already. Most of all, it sounds stupid but I reall miss the people. Bring plenty money to tip those people. Americans have already been blessed with so much, it really wouldnt hurt to bless those people. Make sure you meet Walter and Fransisco of the animation team. (Walter will definately make you laugh and Jenny the restaunt host, and Peola Gabriela, Kenya, and Janet at the front desk. like (Janet, the first day i met her i told her i liked the banana clip she had in her hair and youll notice alot of girls in the d.r. wear them. A couple days later, she called me in my room to come down and get some she had gotten for me as a souvenier) And there was a young light-skinned girl in like the second to last gift shop at the end of the strip in the resort- very friendly. These people will really make your day. My brother also wanted me to mention Micher and Felit at the bar. (of course it would be at the bar). I definately want to go back. I hope more people get the chance to go and definately go to the Majestic... and don't forget to bring whatever you can to bless these people as equally as they will you...oh, and when an agent comes to book tours, don't miss the bus tour- its the whole reason you go to the D.R.oh, and you can snorkel on the beach and or pay one of the boats on the beach to take you out for only 20 dollars and go snorkeling somewher else. so bring a snorkel.The disco goes off at night...  THE END.

<Content>Punta Cana!! We just returned from Majestic Colonial Punta Cana the week of June 12-16th. The hotel grounds are magnificent and we experienced excellent service all the way from the lobby to the waiters at the buffets. Other than one afternoon of rain, the weather was hot and we had blue skies. The sea was a little choppy and there are alot of rocks but it won't stop you from getting in. We originally stayed on the 3rd floor facing construction but after speaking to management for a better view, we were transfered to a room with a pool view. The rooms were nicely decorated with marble counters and a standing shower that could hold more than 2 people comfortably. The pool is huge and the best spot in it is near the walk up bar. Most of the action is right there also because the entertainment crew entertains right there. Quick shot out to JESUS (Mr. blablabla lol),Nina, Melvin, Masiel, Leo, Warter, Francisco, Ive and Pablo. They were great. They did a good job getting people involved and playing silly entertaining games. The best bartender we encountered was Roberto, located at the lobby bar. The Spa is out of this world. A must excursion for the trip.Restaurants were good not great. Don't go there expecting Ruth Chris and you will be fine. Overall I would say that I think that this hotel deserves its top 5 rank in popularity on Trip Advisor. Majestic is a great value when you add up the service, appearance, food and variety of entertainment.

<Content>Great Resort The resort was great. The complex is beautiful, especially at night with the suble lighting. We were there in June and did not have any problems with bugs at all. The food is not 5 star, but is certainly good, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I don't speak a bit of spanish, but was able to communicate effectively to the entire staff, not sure why people complain about spanish speaking people not having perfect english. I would definately suggest the Majestic Colonial.

<Content>great hotel just arrived home from a great 2 week holiday at the Majestic.check in was quick and easy got a great room as requested to Richard and we had a fruit platter and champagne waiting for us.the hotel grounds are fantasticthe staff are excellent and the service is too these people who complain that they cant speak english please get a life.we are from the UK and maybe we are a lot more tolerant than our american friends who i must say were very rude to the staff on many occasions that i witnessed.we never had any issues at all with any of the staff every single one of them always had a smile for you and guess what you did not have to tip to get better serviceit was my birthday while we were there and the hotel arranged a champagne breakfast in the room and a birthday cake that night in the steakhouse.the table was decorated beautifully and all the staff sang Happy Birthday.little touches like that make all the dfifference.the beach is beautiful and you could get a bed at any time of the day.we walked the beach for miles and went into many of the other hotels and i can confirm without a shadow of a doubt that the Majestic was by far the best.the Riu Palace coming a close second.the food was not brilliant but how people can say there was not much choice i do not know.i am a fussy eater and always found something good.the only place we really did not enjoy was the Gourmet in fact we thought it was awful.we had no stomach problems at all throughout our stay.the entertainment was ok not brilliant but not bad.the usual 5 star all inclusive but i must say better than the Rius and i have stayed at quite a few.the indoor sitting areas were really tastefully laid out and the furniture was lovely.all in all we loved the hotel and would recommend it to anyonemy one and only complaint which was absolutely nothing to do with the hotel was the inconsiderate young americans who drunk too much and shouted and screamed all over the hallways every single night waking everybody up.dont ever complain about brits abroad until you have experienced these mouthy brash drunken louts.other than that we loved it.hello to rosie and jim ,duncan and emma, helen and gary,stuart and jane and last but not least steve and ashley.

<Content>AMAZING EVERYTHING! I have traveled to Punta Cana quite a few times and I have never been more pleased with a resort. It will be hard to give anywhere else a chance.I resort itself, the grounds, and the pool were all amazing. The pool starts up by the lobby and is about 4 feet deep and you can walk all the way down to the beach in the pool. Its awesome. We were in there all day when we weren't playing lawn chess or ping pong. The staff at the customer relations, and swim up bar were amazing. There were drinks ready for us before we were even up at the bar. We paid $175 to have a 4 course meal on the beach where they go well out of their way to decorate, give you roses when you leave, you get personal musicians, and your own waiter, who was awesome. It was probably the best meal I have ever had in my life and the experience was more than worth the money. The food in the buffet was average. TONS of variety and you can always find at least something that you like. The coffee is strong, but good. I suggest eating at the Japanese restaurant, and the seafood and steakhouse at the beach. They are a la carte restaurants, but we did not need to make reservations and the food was amazing in all restaurants. Way better than the buffets. We were in room 1417 which was on the 4th floor (to the left walking out of the lobby) and a corner room, so we had 2 balconies. One good sized balcony with a partial ocean view and a bistro style table and chairs. And another balcony with a hot tub and loungers. Our room was HUGE and amazing. We met other people at the resort and their rooms were the regular rooms on the side that the theatre is on (right side out of the lobby), and their rooms were also nice. Just like ours, just a little smaller. I have read MANY REVIEWS stating that people fall ill on their vacations. The first time I came to the DR I almost got sick, but it did go away and I was only ill that one day. So here are my tips, because you DONT NEED TO GET SICK. THEIR FOOD IS NOT BAD! ITS OURS THAT IS THE PROBLEM!Some people may not agree, but it is not the food in the DR that is the problem. They do not use preservatives and pesticides. They pick things fresh and grow it themselves and dont even add many spices. People get sick on their 3rd-5th days there because the food in their system that they ate before they left is making its way out in my experience. In Canada and the US we eat a lot of bad food, even when we think its healthy. SO when you eat natural food it cleans your body out. And that is what happens. So eat healthy for a couple of weeks before you leave. ALSO, stay away from coconut drinks! Coconut is a natural laxative. If you drink Pina Coladas and Coco Locos, you WILL get the runs. I guarantee it! And obviously if you drink a lot, when you wake up in the morning you will have that natural morning issue.As I said, I was sick the first time I visited the DR, i was 17. I have been there many times since, and never been sick. I have never had issues with the food. I also am a healthy eater so I believe that has a lot to do with it. THE LANGUAGE BARRIERI dont know much spanish at all. But I have never had an issue with communication. Everyone that I dealt with at this resort knew english enough to communicate with. REMEMBER, you are in THEIR country. So you should be learning their language. Dont compain if they dont know much english, its not their fault that we've made their country a tourist attraction. I will go to this resort over and over again. It was amazing.

<Content>Loved the Majestic Booked my trip through Bookit.com a great webside for discount trips. I loved the Majestic There was about 5 weddings the entire time some on the beach and some in the Gazebo. Very nice. Rooms were great nice and big. Shower huge. If you go with friends having a bathroom whose door is not ceiling to floor may be a little uncomfortable with a signficant other makes not difference. Beautiful Rooms. Champagne left in our room. Greeted upon arrival with Majestic punch which was great. I enjoyed most of the food. They are not good at the suchi or chineese cuisine. But Hubachi was great. The Domincan/spanish restaurant great and seafood scruptios. The beach was also very nice. The only other thing I can point out is what I learned before departing - 95% of their liquor is all inclusive but top shelf like Black Label, Hennessy, Heiniken beer you have to pay additional for. They do have other good brands but something to keep in mind. I would definitly go back to the majestic but I would be open to seeing other resorts on the island as well. Pool was fantastic, Shows were great. I highly recommend to famiies with kids as they have activities for them all day as well.

<Content>Vacation, Wedding and Honeymoon...great time! We spent 8 days (6/14 - 6/21 ) at Majestic Colonial and had our wedding with 50 guests in attendance. We got a package deal for around $90/pp ($180 per night)Overall, the experience was very good and we would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a compromise between price, amenities, and quality for anyone staying in Punta Cana.During our stay the hotel was completely booked so it was at maximum capacity, yet it never really felt crowded which was a definite plus for us. We could always get a covered chair on the beach and always received service at the restaurants without too much of a wait.As one would expect when visiting a developing country, there are definitely some things that will just be out of your control so I want to make sure I present this as realistic as possible.Service:- Although this is an all-inclusive resort, tipping always helps you get better service. It is definitely an American influenced way of eating, so if you aren't used to it then expect service to not be nearly as attentive when you don't tip. Also, we didn't tip unless the service was good because there were some great servers and not-so-great servers at the resort.- The servers and bartenders speak very little English, so please realize that yelling doesn't make things any better. Speaking a few basic words definitely makes things easier for all parties involved. Most Dominicans are nice people and will try their best to understand what you want.Room/Property:- I will admit that we are somewhat biased here, since we had a beachfront room on the third floor (room numbers 2345-2350) and had no problems with our A/C, mold, or room-cleaning. We had plenty of towels, actually an excess of towels, and had everything we needed.- We also took advantage of room-service, since it was included in our package, almost everyday during our stay. It was decent although we have definitely had *much* better quality of food choices before.- Overall, the room was clean, spacious, free of smell (we were on 3rd floor) and cool.- One side of the resort is facing construction at the moment so those rooms might have a bit more noise and a less pleasant view.- Expect to walk a lot, the resort is quite large.Food:- The resort has decent food, but it's definitely not 5-star meals. You will see the same things for breakfast and lunch, but dinner is much more varied across the various restaurants. We ate at every restaurant, including the two reservation restaurants, and found them to be pretty good. The food is very similar to other all-inclusive resorts in a similar price range, so if you've done all-inclusive then you know what to expect.- Keep in mind that you can request more than one plate or multiple servings if you are not content. We usually were able to get extra seafood, meats or whatever we desired without much resistance. The meats and fish, particularly lobster tails, were very good at the various restaurants.- We also ate lots of salads, fruits (with and without skin), and other watch out foods without experiencing any sickness. Your mileage might vary on how well your immune system is doing as far as sickness goes, but in our group of 50 people only 3 people got sick, mostly upset stomaches, possibly due to overindulgence of alcohol and food.- We enjoyed all the restaurants with our favorite foods being lobster tails and shrimp.Weather:- Rainy first day and occasional storm clouds throughout stay, but they were brief rains.Beach:- Great beaches, but some parts of the water are quite rocky so definitely try to stay on the right side where it is less rocky.- Majestic has a nice beachfront property and it is not very crowded which makes it a much more pleasurable experience. You can quickly gauge how nice Majestic is by taking taking a walk on the beach to adjacent properties that are overflowing with guests and not nearly as nice.- Always got covered seating and good drinks service on the beach.Activities/shows:- The kids on our trip (ages 6-13) had a great time at beaches and pools. - Surprisingly there is no arcade room, which is common at most these resorts.- The billiards/ping-pong area for kids is really lacking and could use a face-lift.- The nightly entertainment is your typical rotating shows across the resorts in Punta Cana. The theatre where shows are performed is hot and has poor air-circulation, so definitely have lots of drinks while there to help cool off. Most the shows themselves are a bit cheesy but there was a decent cirque-du-soleil imitation show and the Michael Jackson (Yes, I know some people don't care much for him) show was pretty good.- The discotheque is typical resort disco with popular hits. The DJ was actually pretty decent and it was full of people until about 12-1am, but most people dropped off after that. The only downside is poor exhaust in the disco making sure you'll get plenty of 2nd hand smoke while there.- The casino also has poor ventilation, so you can continue to get 2nd and 3rd hand smoking while in there. There are also top-shelf liquors you can purchase, which are not included. The casino is not vegas, just a small casino with 3-4 tables and a bunch of slots.- Snorkeling and kayaking are included, as well as a few other water activities which were quite fun.- Animation team has activities all day long if you want to dance, do aerobics, play games, etc.Bars/Drinks:- There are different colored wrist bands and during our stay the gray colored bands meant premium drinks. Most drinks will be made with cheap as hell local rum called Brugal. Brugal rum sucks and you *MUST* request your drink to be made with a specific rum, vodka or whiskey else they will use the cheap stuff.- Top-shelf liquors such as Grey Goose, black label whiskey, grand marnier, etc. are not included, yet they display the bottles as if they are. Most all-inclusive resorts don't include them and only those that say PREMIUM INTERNATIONAL drinks are included. You also will pay accordingly at those resorts if you can't survive without top-shelf liquors.- Overall, most drinks are pretty good and they will add more liquor to the drinks if you ask them politely.Wedding/Honeymoon:- We did a very basic wedding in the Gazebo for about $1000 and it definitely exceeded our expectations. The wedding included everything mentioned on their list, as well as reception for all 50 people at a restaurants. Unless you really want a private dinner reception, it is not necessary. We had a non-private reception at no extra cost in the Rodeo Grill. We had our own section of the restaurant with decorated table settings and dedicated waiters, as well as wedding cake and champagne.- The wedding coordinators (Aurelio and Larissa) are *very* professional and do their best to make things work as easily as possible. Just keep in mind that they do about 2-4 weddings a day, so you are not the only *diva* for that day and they can only accomplish so much on a short notice.Tips:- Learn some basic Spanish to make things a bit easier. You don't need to be fluent, but gratitude and counting numbers are a big plus. Just remember that your basic spanish will most likely trump their basic english.- This is the caribbean, so expect to see mosquitoes, ants, roaches, etc. from time to time. It is just inevitable to prevent these bugs at a resort like these, so if this is a problem then maybe you should stay home.- Shopping at the resort is expensive, make sure to bring enough sunscreen, sunglasses, sandals, bathing suits, mosquito repellant, aloe vera gel, etc.Finally, have fun, relax, and enjoy!!

<Content>Great Trip...Don't believe the reviews!!!! All I can say is that this hotel/resort exceeded my expectations! I traveled with a group of 14 people hailing from Texas, Maryland , and Illinois for a dual birthday celebration with ages averaging from late 20鈥檚 to late 30鈥檚. We traveled on the dates May 29 through June 2, 2008. I can say that I had my doubts about the Majestic prior to coming to the resort. Many of the reviews from other travelers made me want to ask for my deposit back. Please do not believe these people!!! I鈥檓 going to go quickly down the list of events to give you honest unbiased feedback. Hotel/room: The room looks just like the pictures. Yes, there is an open concept but just bring a robe if you're not rooming with a mate. The only time there is a problem is if you decide you want to take a bath; my roommate did while I was elsewhere. No big deal. Some people mentioned the slight musty smell鈥?yes that can be a problem when your hotel is 5 feet away from the ocean with outdoor rooms!!! Get over it, once you take a shower the smell goes away. I will say that a guest on our trip 鈥渓ost鈥?her watch. I read that this might happen. I told all the people in my group prior to coming not to bring anything valuable to the resort. Some people used the safe. However, I also read that safes were being broken into. The smartest thing I saw someone do was to bring a solid lock for her suitcase. If someone wants your items that bad to steal your entire suitcase- maybe they need it more than you?! All and all the rooms were nice, great room service, and the refrigerator was stocked everyday. Food: I was very impressed by the food and the choices. The breakfast buffet named Supreme was exactly as its namesake. Make sure you wake up in time for this (ends at 10am). If not, the beach buffet was also tasty. We tried all of the restaurants and the food did not disappoint us. Will you have a steak that tastes like it鈥檚 from Morton鈥檚? No, but you should enjoy the food as if you were going to any other restaurant. And if you don鈥檛 like what you ordered鈥?get something else鈥t鈥檚 all-inclusive remember???????? Beach/pool: Great no problems! Plenty of room and the drinks were always on time! Activities: I thought aerobics, beach volleyball and salsa lessons on the beach were corny but I caught myself trying to get in on the action; and had fun doing it! The staff also had drinking games at the pool to keep everyone entertained. A couple of my friends went to the nightly shows: celebrity imitations, Michael Jackson, etc. My friends enjoyed it and we were all late 20鈥檚- 30's skeptics. Other reviews say the Michael Jackson show was corny, but when I walked up at the end of the show, I saw grown men trying to get pictures with the performers. I鈥檓 talking about grown manly men鈥? Go figure! The casino was small so don鈥檛 expect to hit it big every night. The discoteque was nice and we were able to watch the NBA playoffs on the big screens. The music however, is mostly meurange, salsa, and reggaeton. Please don鈥檛 forget that you are in the Dominican Republic and Spanish is the official language. A couple of nights we took a cab to another resort鈥檚 club called Mangu鈥檚 it was pretty nice if you want something different for the nightlife. All in all, the staff was great- very friendly and helpful; the resort was absolutely beautiful; truly a paradise. If you have any questions you can send it through tripadvisor.

<Content>beautiful hotel but would not go back Punta Cana,Majestic ColonialWe just returned from the Majestic on June 18th. The hotel is beautiful, the pool is really a sight to see. All the grounds around the hotel are kept beautiful. Our room was big and very clean. There is a lot of walking involved to get from the lobby to the beach.Our first problem was that most of the employees don't speak english,so its hard to comminicate with them. In the restaurants we had a problem getting what we ordered for dinner because they didn't understand us, ,some nights we didn't get our full order. We ordered a steak for dinner and they asked us what we wanted to drink and we said a beer, we then asked for tabasco sause for the steak and they put the tabasco sauce in the beer. There is no decaf perked coffee, all they have is instant. I can't believe a big hotel hotel like that would not have decaf perk coffee. The food was ok nothing to brag about. We were told by guests that had been there last year and were returnig again the same week we were there that the quality of the food had gone down since last year. The drinks were very watered down. To be really honest i would not return to the majestic again.

<Content>wonderful vacation Just back from a wonderful vacation to DR Majestic. Stayed from 6/12 to 6/17. Hotel was beautiful. Arrival had no problems, front desk was quick and polite and understood english. Welcome drink on arrival was very good. Bags brought to our junior suite rooms, we had a connecting room for our 2 kids, aged 18  15. Could not believe the beautiful view of the pool and beach!!! Very tropical feeling. Our rooms were just past the spa. Very large rooms. The beds were a little hard for my taste but my husband has a bad back and he loved it. My kids didn't comment one way or the other. jacuzzi in the room, really fun. The shower could fit 6 people but the toilet was a little small. Welcome bottle of wine in the room along with a letter stating we could get breakfast and champagne delivered one morning no extra charge. The second night we came into our rooms and found majectic polo shirts there for us. Mini bar and towels stocked twice a day, something my husband raved about. We found that most of the staff spoke some english, enough of what we needed to say. They understand Pina Colada in any language. Never had trouble getting a drink. My son loved it there because he could drink with no problems. They had a drink of the day each late afternoon and evening, got to try some different types. Food was adequate, not to rave about but certainly not terrible. There were some foods I didn't care for but I wouldn't care for it in the US either. The buffett had something for everyone. So much to choose from. Granted some things were better than others but I found that most of the food was only luke warm unless you had them make it fresh for you. My husband and son went to the seafood rest on the beach and enjoyed the lobster and shrimp, my daughter and I went to the steakhouse and I loved!!!! the chateau briand, it just melted in my mouth. We did not care for the chinese food but not because it was bad but it was just different from what we were used to. We did not go to the Le Chateau. The Le B of M opens at 11:00 pm. Food there not so bad but not great. We had the most wonderful time relaxing and enjoying the pool and drinks. It did rain all day Saturday when we were taking our dune buggy excursion but besides being cold from being soaked, it was fun. Lots to do at the hotel, don't really need to leave there. theatre show everynight at 10:00, animation team during the day and a very small casino. We played 4 nights.My husband did get sick the last day and thinks it was the sushi he had. He had a peice that had a fish or something he couldn't identify, and he thinks that might have been what did it.. We had all had sushi and all of us drank the water. He was the only one who had any problems. He says he would still go back. The country is beautiful, very very green and has mountains. Poor living conditions though, roads really really bad. I was really amazed at how beautiful the hotel was, we have travelled alot and we think this was the nicest rooms we have stayed in. Thanks GOGO. Only bad thing I can really think of is the line you have to stand in to get your return time. They will usher you into the theatre to try to sell you tours. I just want my time so I can get out on the beach.

<Content>Amazing Wedding And Trip We got back about two weeks ago from the Majestic Colonial and I just want to say anyone who has anything bad to say about this place clearly is just out to have a bad time. We chose this resort to get married at and we couldn鈥檛 be happier. Aurelio was our wedding coordinator and he did everything possible to make our day wonderful and beautiful! Our wedding could not have gone smoother! We had Keiko (spelling?) as our photographer and I highly recommend him, he was amazing the photos came out beautiful, so much attention to detail, he knows what he is doing! Overall our wedding was FANTASTIC! We got a room upgrade and it was bigger then our first apartment, hot tubs, 2 balconies, a huge suite, a huge bedroom, and everything was decorated beautifully!!! I couldn鈥檛 imagine something better!!!The majestic itself was amazing!!! There are things to do there right up until 5 in the morning!!!! Casinos, discos, shows, food, dancing, entertainment! Everything was amazing, I was beyond impressed, this place really set the bar high, I couldn鈥檛 believe it! The beaches and activities are the best around! Our second week we were supposed to go to the Riu Palace Punta Cana which was hugely recommended by a lot of people鈥?we were depressed as soon as we got there, we wanted to go back to the majestic so badly, apparently you can switch back, all you need to do is find your rep and pay the charge for the room differences for the two hotels and you can switch, something we didn鈥檛 know until we inquired. We went to Riu on Saturday and by Tuesday we were back in the majestic, happy again! Ray and nina were amazing! There are tones of other awesome staff there, the whole animation team is awesome, they really try and get you to participate and teach you to dance and have a good time, beach parties and private dinners are awesome, we took a group of 27 and everybody was stunned at how amazing everything was, a huge selection of amazing food and drinks and an awesome time! I would DEFINATELY come back again! It was an amazing wedding, and a wonderful stay!!

<Content>How they handle an emergency.. So we stayed as a party of 28 at the majestic for a wedding and i was one of the bridesmaid. The wedding was perfect, the staff, food, timing, I have never seen such perfection when it comes to a wedding, I have been to many, If you want a fair tale wedding this is the place.However i did have an interesting experience. At the reception my friend dislocated his right knee and had to see a doctor, the 24hr on staff doctor, Dr. Campos was there instantly and he had paramedics on the scene within minutes. Turns out his knee was worse than we expect and so we went to the hospital and i was worried A) I had none of my friend insurance info on me and B) foreign country with no Spanish. The paramedics, Disi and his partner were excellent, they not only took us into the hospital but they ensure we were settled, had all the forms we need and even introduced us to the English speaking staff that would help me. Even at the end of the night when we were leaving they were dropping off someone in the hospital and offered us a ride back to the hotel. One thing, you have to pay your bill upfront before leaving the hospital. There was a huge problem with my bill and they charged us twice, Dr. Campos informed me, made contact with the hospital regarding missing documents (not many who answer the phone speak English) and also followed up with my friend on his condition. It was comforting to know at the end of the day that they had all the modern technology and meds that we could ever need and when i go back to Punta Cana I will make sure i stay at a resort covered by the same medical company, you could not ask for more.Dr.Campos arranged for a wheelchair and management arranged for me to take meals to our room.The food is good , not great but what do you want? You have to pay more for quality.The rooms were great and very clean. The staff were friendly and helpful, however a family member did have an issue and when we went to address it customer service tried to dismiss it, I had to insist to speak with a Manager, she stated i would be contact as to when the meeting was. my family member and I (in separate rooms) received letter at 6:00pm the next day when i was in my room, stated that our meeting with the manager was to be at 5:30pm! I was disappointed in this lack of professionalism, and for this reason alone would not go back to Majestic.

<Content>Majestic Colonial Punta Cana We just returned from our stay at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. The resort, and the island in general, was wonderful! The grounds and buildings are gorgeous, the staff is amazing and the beach is breathtaking. Our room was very nice (although it did have a bit of a mildew smell so bring an air freshener). We liked the Japanese and French restaurants the best, and the steak house was also good. Many people have complained about the food, but we were able to get pretty good meals almost every time we ate.I can't say enough about how awesome the staff were. Denny, our beach concierge, would meet me every morning under my umbrella on the beach for our morning conversation in Spanish (his idea to help me brush up on my Spanish). He never let our drinks get warm, or empty! Eddie the DJ was another amazing employee at the hotel! He made the wedding reception we were at just amazing!We would definitely go back to the Majestic!

<Content>Loved the Majestic We loved our trip to Punta Cana, we stayed at the Majestic Colonial and it was beautiful. From the beginning of our stay the staff and accomadations were excellent and it continued through out our stay. We traveled with another a family with kids ranging from 10 years to 15. The beach was beautiful and we were able to walk only a few yards out in the water and put on goggles and look at the tropical fish. We never had any trouble finding chairs either in the sun or under the shade, by the pool or by the beach. Denny the beach consierge was fantastic! We went on two excursions, the snorkling and the ATV's. Both were well worth the money. We also went para-sailing, well worth the money too. The food was excellent especially our last night, we went to the Japanesse restaurant and had a wonderful experience. You will need to make reservations so do that right away. The evening shows were very entertaining for the whole family. Another member of the animation team Ivelisse was so nice and friendly it's worth mentioning. If you like the sun and enjoy friendly, accomadating staff, good food, beautiful rooms, gorgeous resort and want to have memories that last a life time you cannot go wrong with the Majestic Colonial Resort in Punta Cana. The best trip we have ever had!

<Content>What your should know about the Majestic before you go. I thought you should read what people are not telling you about the Majestic. Sorry...these are mostly negative but you've already read the positves over and over again.Yes, there are mosquitos. Some of the people we were traveling with did not have any problems but we sure did. After returning to our room each afternoon we would kill a minumum of three. They seem to like the yellow curtains and bed canopy. Two mornings I woke up with bites on my face and neck. The maids leave your room door open while cleaning.Always keep your deadbolt locked while in your room. The staff does not use the motion sensor to detect if your in your room...they will knock and come on in. Luckily, we were dressed the first time this happened. The mini bar guy that came around each morning was the worst for knocking and then opening the door. He was great to remember we wanted extra water after telling him the first day.Do not plan on sleeping in at this resort. Especially if your in buildings 3 or 4 with low room numbers (i.e. 3204, 4306, 3110) pay attention to the last two digits when they assign you a room. Because of the close proximity that the buildings are to each other in the low number rooms create an echo. You hear the maids taking carts through the hallways all night long and even one morning there was a maid cleaning the railing with her broom which was a constant banging. We were never able to sleep later than 7am any morning. These rooms are also close to the nightly entertainment. So if you plan on turning in before midnight...forget it. Remember building 4 balconys face the new construction.Bring your own pillow. The hotels were very flat. One was not enough and two pillows stacked was too much. I suggest not to risk it if you have neck issues.We went to the main buffet one night for dinner and found the food to be mediocre. Our saving grace was the pizza station. If they do not have anything to your liking from the premade pizzas ask them to make you a special pizza with the toppings of your choice. We had a fantastic pizza. They make all of their pizza dough fresh as well as their breads. On their dessert bar they had a tray of brown course type of food (I don't know how to describe it) I decided to try it and it was coconut and great.To give them credit they are trying to serve several nationalities with their food service. We always found something to eat so do give everything a try. You never know what you may discover.Internet speed was similar to dial-up. You have to purchase time and it's continuous from the time you first log in. We purchased 72 hours and we had 3 days of continuous internet service and then it expires.After walking the beach we discovered that the Majestic had the most covered areas at the beach and pool. This is a huge plus as the sun is strong and we saw quite a few people with burns.Our over all experience was good. I don't want my negatives to discourage anyone from visiting the Majestic.

<Content>Majestic Horror I traveled to this hotel with my mother. We are 30 and 50 respectively. I had just recently finished my masters degree and this was to be a celebratory trip. I had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to request a room as close to the beach as possible. When we arrived at the resort we were taken directly to our room and found that the hotel had not only honored my request but had upgraded us to a beachfront room with an extremely large balcony. We were absolutely thrilled and expected a phenomenal vacation. We had read the reviews on tripadvisor and knew to expect sub par food. We figured that it wouldn't be that big of a deal given the beauty of our room, the resort, and the beach. We were there to relax and enjoy the beach and the sun, everything else was secondary. The first night we were there we had dinner at the seafood restaurant on the beach. We both woke up during the night with some gastrointestinal issues but by early morning we were feeling better and we were determined to not let it ruin our day. The second night we decided to skip dinner after walking into both the buffets. Breakfast was consistently good so we decided that we would eat alot during that meal as the rest of the food was so awful. We had made two reservations at Le Gourmet, one for the third and the fifth night we were at the hotel. After eating at Le Gourmet the first time my mother fell ill. Since she has a weak stomach we attributed her sickness to her change in eating habits. She stayed in or close to the room the next day but was feeling a little better by the day after. However at this point she decided that she would only eat packaged items and tried to adhere to the BRAT diet - bananas, rice, applesauce, and tea (this diet is great if you find yourself ill on vacation). We dined at Le Gourmet on our fifth night. My mother abstained from eating while I foolishly went ahead and had dinner. The next morning I woke up feeling like I had been hit by a truck. Not only was I vomiting and going to the bathroom every 5 minutes, but I had developed a high fever by mid morning. I felt as if I had the flu. My muscles were stiff and achy and I could barely move. We had an excursion planned for that morning so I called the front desk at 6am and asked to speak to the manager on duty. I was connected to the Night Manager, Callyx. To make a long story short he was rude, argumentative, and unhelpful. He told me that I would have to go to Medical to get a note from the doctor for him to be able to do anything. He then told me that the cost would be $90/pp. When I told him that I was unable to walk to the medical facility he told me that I could pay more to have them come to me. I told him that the Dr visit would cost more than my excursion and he simply said oh well. When I asked for the name of the General Manager he repeatedly told me that he was the manager. There was no language barrier issue, he was purposely being uncooperative. When I finally, out of frustration, told him that I didn't care who he was b/c he wasn't helping me his response was if you don't care who I am then I don't care who you are......and then he hung up. Sick and in tears I waited until 9am and called my travel agent back in the US. She was shocked and appalled because she books this hotel frequently...However both my mother and myself have used the same agent for the past 8 years, generally travel 3-6 times a year each, and we have NEVER complained about a hotel. I'm not sure who she spoke to or what she said but a few hours later the Relations Manager Oscar and the Dr come to our room. The Dr took one look at me, took my blood pressure and temperature and pronounced me very ill. Oscar apologized for the way we had been treated and promised that room service would bring me anything I liked - so I made my high maintenance request for saltines and bananas. He also promised me that he would arrange a meeting with the General Manager, whose name I finally found out was Jose Maria. Needless to say I never got my meeting. We ate bananas and crackers for the last two days of our trip. As we were checking out Oscar came over to apologize again and to offer a voucher for two free nights if we wanted to return to the resort again. Absolutely ridiculous! We would NEVER return even if the trip was free.For all of the naysayers and nonbelievers I just want to clarify that we did not drink the water, we only drank bottled water and did not imbibe any alcoholic beverages. We were also very careful about what we ate. Everywhere we went we heard people discussing their various illnesses and symptoms. I always read the reviews on this site and take the negative ones with a grain of salt b/c I know some people are just difficult to please. We are not those type of people. We went to this resort expecting beautiful beaches and terrible food. What we got was a beautiful resort that we were only able to fully enjoy 3 out of the 6 days we were there due to unsanitary food. That is UNEXCUSABLE. Visit this hotel only if you want to be able to boast to people that you once had E COLI or if you prefer unprofessional, uncaring and downright rude management.

<Content>Dissapointing My fiance and I stayed at the Majestic for our honeymoon last week. I have to say we were greatly dissapointed. First of all, upon check in we were told they needed a document I didnt have and they charged me an additional $1000. This was supposed to be returned as soon as they sorted this out, but the return is still pending on my credit card. We had dinner our first night at the seafood restaurant (outside dining). This was the worst meal of the trip and we avoided this restaurant and the steakhouse (both outside) for the rest of our trip. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the Japanese restaurant. I tried to stick to local foods - Mahi Mahi is their local fish and always tasted fresh. The traditional dominican rice and beans were always seasoned well and fresh, we loved the churros served at breakfast. Our bed was terrible and the canopy fell down twice in the middle of the night. We also had a problem with face cloths (I noticed this came up in a previous post) we NEVER got them!! Finally the last day we received three. One morning we woke up to a blackout. There was no electricity or water for about 3 hours. This was very frustrating (and unsanitary). We enjoyed the pool, had fun kayaking and the animation team was pretty good (Although if I hear It's Raining Men one more time I will die.) It seemed very family oriented, I would consider returning one day when we have children if the food wasnt so bad. Oh - on our last day we saw a roach in our room. I was grossed out and ready to return home.

<Content>LOVED THE MAJESTIC!!!!!!! The Majestic Colonial Resort was so amazing. I have so many wonderful things to say but I want to keep this easy to read and short and sweet. The pool was huge always clean and it wasn't cold. The Rooms where great always cleaned and restocked by noon. The Service was outstanding. The staff was very friendly and helpful they were always working hard to keep the Majestic perfect. The beach was amazing more than enough loungers no matter what time of day. They also had beach beverage service. The food was good lots of choices never had any complaints or stomach issues. The animation team did an absolute incredible job. There was always something planned either on the beach for aerobics, dance, lessions, games, olympics during the day and at night a beach party with a tribal type dance show, a limbo contest (which I won by the way) and a dance floor afterwards on the beach. During the day by the pool they had aerobics, lance lessions, drinking contests, iron man contest, arm wrestling contests and a bikini contest. As you can see there was tons of things to do way more than mentioned, you didn鈥檛 have to participate if didn鈥檛 want to. At night there was a show in the theatre ideal couple, circus, celebrity show which consisted Madonna, Mc Hammer, Britney Spears and Usher. A magic show and a Michael Jackson show. Then following the shows the animation team would then continue to the disco. The disco is right beside the casino where we spent some of our time.The resort is the place for a relaxing vacation with great entertainment. It wasn鈥檛 a party place please don鈥檛 think that it just had fun activities to entertain. We loved the majestic we didn鈥檛 want to leave during our stay to do any day trips. One of the things that made this trip so special was the amazing friendships that were made.

<Content>Great Time at Majestic!!! Here goes my review - Traveled May 19th - 25th. This was our 4th time to the DR. Having stayed before at the Iberostar Bavaro and Iberostar LaRomana. This was a graduation gift to our two daughters 21 and 25 (lst time for them to DR). My brother and his wife also decided to join us.Rooms - We had three different room categories between us. Thank you Richard for all your help. My husband and I had a Col. Jr. Suite, the girls had a swim-up room and my brother and his wife had a standard room. All rooms had identical furniture. Our room (1420) had was bigger because we had two balconies. One was for the rooftop hot tub, which we only used twice, it was way too hot up there. The other balcony overlooked the resort next door and had a partial oceanview. Would I pay again for this room upgrade. No. My brother and his wife had a great standard room (2334) overlooking the pool area. My daughters had the swim-up room (2148), great location, near the beach and the beginning of the pool. I had requested for them a room with two double beds, this room had a king bed. They decided not to switch. Their only issue with the room was that they had quite a few mosquitos in room. I think it was because it was due to the fact they were on the lst floor with the grassy area in front that got watered daily and was in the shade. We had no mozzies nor did my brother. The girls did not use their outdoor hot tub (really no privacy) and I also made a point to check the other swim-up roomsm I never saw anyone use their hot tub. The girls would go back late in the day and use the lounge chairs to read. We all had champagne in room upon arrival. Also, during the week we all received white wine, red wine, fruit platter, cheese platter, sushi, salmon and grapes delivered to our room. Letters welcoming us and we also received hats and shirts. We also all had slippers and robes in the rooms. I thought that my water pressure in the huge shower could have been alot better. As far as the room categories go, I really think any room would be great for us if we went again. How much time do you really spend in the room? We would be gone by 8:00am til 5:30pm, back out again at 7:00pm til 9:30 or 10:00pm. I know we are party poopers, the sun just wiped us out.Speaking of the weather, it was great. Someone on the plane said it showed showers all week in the forecast. It sprinkled lightly one night during the beach barbeque and then once more sometime through the night. The weather was hot. We were almost hoping for some relief from clouds.We never had a problem getting beach chairs. I don't know if it was just the week. There were always chairs at the beach no matter what time. We would stay on the beach til around 3:30 or 4:00 and then head up to the pool bar area. Never had a problem getting a few chairs around the pool except on Miss Bikini Contest day. (Though on our last morning, I saw the pool guys take away alot of the loungers around the pool. I don't know where he was bringing them) On a side note, I have to say my tuition payments to college paid off as my younger daughter went to the finals against her sister at the Beer Drinking contest and won!!! (It was who could drink the fastest) She made us proud, I say jokingly.The beach was beautiful. That is what we went for. The ocean was great. There was a few rocks right in front, not a problem though. We stayed on the beach all day and enjoyed the ocean. The pool was nice too, but you can have a pool anywhere. The ocean was much more refreshing than the pool, also a wonderful breeze on the beach.Food - Alot has been said about the food as of late. I thought that the food was just OK. You could always find something to eat. Items should definately be labelled better. The best meal to me was the breakfast. My older daughter is a very picky eater, she managed all week on chicken, pasta, fries, bread and ice cream. The younger one tried all kinds of different stuff. We all ate salad too. I came well prepared with all kinds of meds. No one got sick. The girls even brushed their teeth with tap water. Honestly, if someone got sick, I definately would have felt different about the food. We went to the steakhouse, out of the six of us, 4 loved it, 2 did not (steak overcooked). We all had the chateaubriand. The girls went back a second time and enjoyed it. There were flies around the food down by the lunch buffet. You can eat at the lunch buffet by the lobby (which I heard was better) we were just too lazy to go up there. Again, there was a beach barbeque one night and during the day there was paella on the beach.We never really made it to the shows. The girls saw a couple, said it was fun to watch. They went to the disco one night, there was a real bad musty odor there.The casino was small, lost a little money. It killed some time.Had the photographers take some photos of us. Bought the CD.Enjoyed sitting out in courtyard at night listening to music and dancing under the stars.Lost power one night for about 15 minutes.The vendors that came in were very pushy.Treated the girls and myself to massages at the spa. 50.00pp for 25 minutes.Hubby took the girls on a morning fishing charter 85.00pp. They were bummed, did not catch anything.The grounds were beautiful and well maintained.Tipping - we tipped all the waitstaff, bartenders. I have to say that we were in the minority. I tiipped our maid daily and also the person who restocks the refrigerator. I gave money and cold water to the young man who was picking up the beach trash. He was so appreciative.We used Dominican Airport Transfer for our rides to and from the airport. No problem there.Speaking about airports. I think flying today has gotten worse and will only continue. I want to mention about Miami Airport. I have heard alot of comments about Miami International on this site. We were suppose to have a two hour layover in Miami, as it turned out our flight from Boston to Miami was delayed (mechanical) Our flight from Miami to PC was leaving at 10:50am and we landed at 10:05am. I was sure we were not going to make it and i was certain we would not get our luggage with only 40 minutes to spare. We got off the plane and ran to our next gate and they were already boarding. Way too close!! I plane from Miami to PC went off on time and when we landed and I saw my luggage I was so relieved, until the luggage belt stopped and both of my daughters luggage was not there. What gives with that, we were all on the same flight from Boston. Anyway, the young man at the PC airport said that there was another flight from Miami to PC on its way and hopefully the missing luggage was on that flight. (There were about 6 other people who did not get their luggage also, I believe they all originated from the Boston flight) Lucky for us the luggage made it on the next flight and the girls received theirs at around 6:00pm at the Majestic. You can imagine how happy two young women were to receive their luggage. When we had gone previously to La Romana I did not get any luggage for 2 days (another story).I cannot end this without saying how great the animation team was. We had a nice time getting to know them. If you did not want to be bothered by them, they would leave you be. They work such long hours into the night. Hola, to Ray, Walter, Tony, Francisco (Oskay!!!), Maciel, Maria, Leon and Melvin. Auntie Donna says Hola, too.In closing, we had a wonderful week. As I mentioned earlier this was a trip to celebrate both our daughters graduations. We wanted to spend some family time together and give them some R  R before they go off to the real world. It truly was a memorable week for us and we would not hesitate to recommend the Majestic and we are looking forward to returning.I hope this review has helped someone as I always check Trip Advisor before we go anywhere.

<Content>Amazing Vacation I booked my vacation here through CheapCaribbean.com and got an amazing deal. I was worried because you never know if you're getting ripped off, but I could not have been happier with the customer service I received. I was traveling alone with my three children under the age of nine and was looking for the perfect place that we would all be able to enjoy. I continuously called CheapCaribbean.com to find out about different resorts in the Dominican and what they offered. The customer service workers were more than happy to help and called the hotels directly if they couldn't provide me with a direct answer to save me the cost of an international call. The bus ride from the airport to the hotel was not bad at all. A little bumpy, but you can't count on a luxury experience while traveling down dirt roads. It just added to the experience. When you pull up to the Majestic, you are just blown away by the elegance of this resort. As soon as the workers saw I was alone with three kids, I had two people over helping me with my luggage and to get me checked in. They gave us hand towels which were nice - especially since my four year old had fallen asleep on the ride there. I laid him down on one of the couches and went through the check in. A waitress walked around with Majestics for the guests to drink while waiting in line. My kids fell in love with these drinks (which you can get with rum at any of the bars!) Check out went really well and although we had arrived earlier than check in time, they got us to a room within 30 minutes! The room we had was AMAZING!!! We had two regular beds and the biggest roll away bed I have ever seen! With all that, the room was still huge! There was a jacuzzi in the room as well that my kids loved. I loved the roominess of the shower although the room with the toilet was a little tight fitting. There was a fruit tray waiting for us and then we got a cheese tray the next night. The pool at this hotel is the best pool I have ever seen in my entire life. Even though it is all connected, there is a wall that divides the pool into two sections - the warmer side (towards the ocean) and the cooler side (towards the lobby). Although the ocean was right there, we did end up spending the majority of time at the pool cause it was just so beautiful. It never really seemed crowded except for near the pool bar where everyone would try to get a spot, but was never uncomfortable. Everyone working there were so friendly. I did not run into one person that worked there that did not smile and greet me as I walked by. If you needed anything, they were willing to get it right away. As you stay there, you get to know the waiters and waitresses and there were a few times I would sit at a table and I didn't even have to ask for my drink because they would just bring it over. I enjoyed a lot of the food, but some of it wasn't my thing. They had enough choices though where you were bound to find something you liked. For breakfast, have them make you omlets! So good. The crepes were amazing as well. I went to all the restaurants minus the fancy one because children aren't allowed in there. Make sure you make reservations for the Japanese restaurant to sit at the hibachi table. But if you just go there without a reservation after they open and ask if they have any room, they will seat you in the restaurant part if they have available space. One of the chefs fell in love with my youngest son and was making him all sorts of things to try. The beach was beautiful - one picture I took with the beach at dusk in the background seriously looked like a fake picture! It was that unreal! The water was so warm it took a little getting used to - because water just isn't supposed to be that warm! lol We did the tubing which was so much fun. It can hurt a little and we did get a few scrapes from the rubber against our skin - my advice would be wear a long sleeved shirt and shorts. My bikini bottom tie got ripped out with the pull of the ocean during the tubing, so be careful!!! The lady that worked there was great though and had it all fixed in no time!We also did the snorkeling tour which was a great experience! My four year old didn't want to do it, so one of the workers on the boat took him and carried him around with her so I could still go out in the water. They sell a video of the trip which I bought. I wouldn't buy it again though unless I knew I was in the video more than I was. There were a few good shots, but if you think you are going to buy the video, make sure you put effort in to get in front of the camera to make it worth the money.Also did the tour through the country side which was a lot of fun. We brought bubble gum and some other little toys for the kids - the bubble gum was a huge hit and some of the kids chased our bus asking for more. One lady thought they were begging for money, but that wasn't the case at all! They definitely have a sweet tooth! By the end of the trip, everyone on the bus with us had wished they had brought candy to hand out. The kids club was slightly disappointing because they didn't really have much planned for the kids other than playing in the water area for them. Don't get me wrong, my kids loved this little play area complete with water slides, but they didn't want to stay there for long periods of time. The women working there were awesome though. I would tip them $5 whenever I left my kids there, which they would always try to give back to me but I wouldn't let them. If you're looking for a place to drop your kids off and do your own thing, I wouldn't count on this resort to provide your kids with non stop fun while you're gone. Mine ended up hanging out with me the majority of our trip and it ended up being fine. I didn't really need to use the kids club except for when we went tubing because the youngest couldn't go. I can't say there were always activities offered to keep you busy, but they had enough to make you feel like there was enough to do between sitting and relaxing by the pool or the ocean. My daughter got a really bad sunburn the day we spent swimming in the ocean. I got the yogurt from the buffet and smeared it all over her body which really seemed to help. Everything about this resort and my stay here was incredible! I can't say enough good about it (even though it had taken me a year to write this review! lol) I also went on the forum for this hotel offered on this site and ended up planning to meet a couple from Connecticut that were going to be there the same time we were. They were great and we have remained in contact ever since the trip!If you have any questions, please email me at heatheroc92576@aol.com and I'll try to answer them as well as I can!If you stay here though, you will not be disappointed!PS. I would post pictures, but my youngest deleted them all from my camera the morning we were leaving. That was the worst part of the trip!

<Content>Great Service!!! The hotel was absolutely beautiful, the rooms were clean and organized very cozy. And the service was phenomenal, Marisol, Regina, Eloy, Claudia and Rafael are some of the employess I dealt with on a daily basis. They attended us for breakfast and the way they treated us was as if we were family. Very efficient, respectful and professional. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and if you have the honor of meeting any of these wonderful people i have named above you'll understand why i'm raving about them they truly went out of their ways to make us feel at home. As well as the employees from the Seafood restaurant Starting with Captain Omar, the food, service and ambiance was spectacular.Thank you for a wonderful stay!!Justo Family

<Content>Coming Back For More! The Majestic is the place to be! Service was excellent. The grounds are beauitful. The variety of food was filling, and you never had an empty drink. There was entainment of all kinds. One night we had a beach party. Another night we had a Magician. Enterainment was met for all ages. There was so much to do we never left the Resort. We just came home on June 13th, 2008 and I have already started to plan our trip back! I was nervous because my husband and I went alone. Wasn't sure if we would be sick of one another or be board stiff. NOT the case. We always had something to do and met a lot of nice people. We met a couple from North Carolina { The Hall's} , exchanged emails and hope to maintain our friendship for years to come. The problems that occured at the resort were minimum and not even worth mentioning. Your on vacation. Go with it! Best money I ever spend and I'm Coming back for more!

<Content>Perfect Vacation! Just got back from the D.R. The trip was awesome. The Majestic Colonial was absolutely beautiful. First off -- Arrival. We arrived into Punta Cana International Airport and we were greeted by our cab driver who was previously contacted by the hotel to provide us with transportation. The cab ride lasted about 40 minutes and allowed us a quick glimpse of the landscape and surroundings. We were greeted with a signature drink (Majestic) and our room was READY and waiting for us. The front desk staff was very courteous and professional. We made it to our room and we were pleasantly surprised with the layout, workmanship, and incredible view of the beach and ocean. Our room was a junior suite and it faced the beach. Third floor room 4343. GET IT!!!! you will not regret it. The room did not smell funky. The floors are marble and the counter tops are granite. They even had a cool espresso maker. The shower is huge. All the nice things were there and it even had two hot tub spas. We found the food to be very good. Absolutely unbelievable selections to choose from. Some fantastic, some not to our taste. But something for everyone to choose from. My taste which is very American (red meat and potatoes) would recommend the Rodeo restaurant. They had excellent steaks, they also have a very tasty Chateau Briand. (spelling) The breakfast buffets near the front of the resort was also incredible. The service and the smiles. The coffee and the chocolate syrup is to die for. The place just invites relaxation to the fullest. It took about three days to completely unwind and let go. The beach is so very nice. Topless and full of Europeans. For every one girl that you may want the to take their top off... there were three more that you wished would put it back on! But all in all the beach was relaxing and very very clean. The sand is sugar and the water was very nice. No undertow and swimming was very safe. No vendors to bug you. And speaking of bugs. No bugs to report. Only one mosquito bite but I did step on a wasp that had landed on the sand. No biggie. It only hurt for a few minutes and a couple of shots of rum took care of the issue. It was our 10 year anniversary. The staff placed a very nice banner on our door, They had a bottle of champagne in the room and also brought us a fancy dessert one night to celebrate our special occasion. Tipping was not an issue. I passed out some bucks the first couple of days, but after that it didn't really matter. We left a buck and a little present for the maids each day. They really appreciated it. All in all this place rocked. You could always tell when an American was present. They were usually the loud mouths or the ones complaining about little issues. But for the money and time. I would recommend this resort to ANYONE. We drank the water- We ate the fruit. And we did not get sick. We are from New Mexico U.S.A. and our limited knowledge of Spanish went a long way.Would we go back? In a New York minute!

<Author>debalex1026
<Content>Biggest waste of money!!! After reading the reviews of this hotel from this website I was already prepared to have some issues but not as bad as what happened. Since I have actually been there I can explain a few of problems that seemed to come up over and over. Our room had a stench of mold so bad that I could not sleep the first night and for every night after that we had to have someone come to our room and spray this green stuff that covers up the smell. And get this.... they come down no questions asked because they know the room smells horrible. We think that when the hurricane hit that area a few years ago the we were in was flooded and it was never properly fixed so mold is growing somewhere (or everywhere). But, in the other building the rooms smelled fine. We were supposed to have a room with an ocean view but what we got was a room that FACED the ocean with the activities building blocking our view. When we first got there (after waiting for 3 hours for our room to be ready) I kicked off my shoes to unload our suitcases into our stinky room and my feet felt like they had dirt on them....the bottom of my feet were literally black and covered in dirt. Who knows what was going on in there while we waited for our room but they were not cleaning it. We also had a problem with the face clothes. I ended up having to hide one in a bag that i carried around with me. We had to call every day to get one. Our room was never serviced completely, if the maid came then the person filling up the minibar would not. Our expresso was never restocked and they do not give you clean glasses in the room to drink out of. They rinse them out (in the bacteria infested water in the room) and just put them back. So, don't use any dishes in the room. they are more than likely dirty. No wonder so many people get sick. We were there for a wedding with a group of 10 people by the end of the week every one of us had some time of stomach issue. The food is horrible at both of the buffets. Make sure you don't eat anything that you don't see them cook in front of you. I had omelets and pasta everyday. Dinner at the restaurants was actually pretty good. Every steak we had was cooked perfect. I did hear from another couple that the japanese restaurant is not worth the effort the food was so bad. I also noticed that the service did not improve after you tipped. We left money every day for the maid and we had issues almost every day. I stopped leaving money the last 2 days because it did not make a difference. Also, beware of the bottled water and make sure the seal on the lid breaks and it is actually filtered water. We had quite a few bottles that tasted as if they were refilled from the tap or something and the lid on all of them came right off with the seal attached. I would not recommend this resort to anyone. There isn't much to do but relax, eat and drink and the food and drinks are horrible. There is no real juice at the bar so if you want anything that has cranberry or orange juice in it you will be disappointed. They use some kind of syrup tasting orange or red drink. I ended up drinking Majestics all week because at least they tasted good. Don't waste your money. It is worth the few extra dollars to go somewhere else.

<Content>This place is fantastic!!!!! Majestic Colonial Hotel was the best hotel EVER! This was my first trip to the carribean and I was so happy that I picked Majestic. The staff is super friendly, funny and they really adopt you as their family during your stay. I was a little apprehensive about this place before I arrived because I didn't read the reviews until months after I booked the hotel. But my worries were put to bed immediately after we arrived. We were greeted with cold towels and the hotel signature drink, Majestic. The pictures of the hotel really do not depict how beautiful this place is. The between the hotel activities and the staff you will be entertained all day. There is really never a dull moment. As for the food, it was not bad. They have plenty of a la carte choices. However, you will have to make reservations for the international and Japanese resturants the day you arrive. I would highly reccommend the Japanese Resturant. We went there the last night of our stay and it was a great way to seal the week. The staff was absolutely phenominal! The only one complaint I would have against the food is they don't serve enough SPANISH FOOD. What's up with that? This is what everyone is coming to D.R. for. But maybe they will have more spanish option in the 2nd phase of the Majestic opening in October. I really enjoyed my week stay. And just to let you know, DENNY the beach conceirge was the BEST! Make sure to give him a hug for me when you see him. Sweetiest conceirge EVER!

<Content>Great resort! A family of six people statyed at this wonderful resort on May 26 2008. The food was great a lot of variety and you could find a place to eat anytime. Also, our room were very clean and we always received wine and drinks. The only issues which is a small one is that I would like for the resort managment to take notice that the resort is very big and I believe they need more security. Furthermore, when we were living a taxi driver wanted us to go with him to the exit of the resort even though we told him that we already had a taxi reserve that was coming to get us.Overall, I would recommend this resort to everybody, because the Pool is huge and very clean, it look like a big swirling river and the food was very tasty and a lot of variety, the employee were all great and wonderful. Will definetly go back in a heart beat if I have the opportunity.Great Job to all the employee at the resorts especially those who prepared the foods!!!!

<Content>Good - but not five star like advertised - 3.5 - 4 star at best Perhaps we expected more from a hotel that states on it's page exquisite gastronomy but at the end of the day it's just another all inclusive. As others have noted on the reviews, the grounds are beautiful with a pool flowing throughout the property. It's not a swimming pool per say - it's only about 3-4' deep through out. However, the hotel is going through a huge expansion that will add a new pool area and (I'd guess) another 900 rooms or so. The new area will be adult only.I'm giving the hotel a rating of a four because of the attentiveness of some of it's staff. For one, Denny, the beach waiter, was very friendly and made sure we had drinks while enjoying one of the best beaches we've seen. The beach must be one of the biggest draws to Punta Cana - bar none. To keep me from rambling on - the highs and lows are below.Highs:- Beaches- Beautiful grounds- Friendly people (not just at the hotel)- Paella - Practicing Spanish (this will be a high or a low depending on your persuasion..)Lows:- Food - Mediocre drinks (unless you asked for a liquor by name and it's on your list or you find a good bartender/waiter)- Surrounding area - it's pretty much the resort- Construction sounds on the beach. (it's not present unless you're near the beach)- Megaphone activities - drinking games - party atmosphere (Over the top but then we're married with a young child so it's a bit different. )- No washcloths??? (have to ask nightly..)

<Content>Paradise!!!! This was our 5th trip to Punta Cana and our second visit to the Majestic. Our stay was 4/27/08 to 5/4/08. We were celebrating our 20th anniversary with 4 of our friends (3 who had never been to Punta Cana). It's hard to believe, but it was even better the second time around. Everyone in our group loved it!! We were in building 3, first floor in 3 consecutive rooms. It was so nice to be able to walk out and meet with our friends on their patio and have a drink  socialize. Thank you to Raphael in reservations who I had emailed back and forth with our requests which were fufilled beyond our expectations. We enjoyed the deliveries every day to our room consisting of wine, fruit plate, chocolate covered grapes, sushi etc... What a nice surprise.  The resort is extremely beautiful and clean. The staff go out of their way to accomodate you. The pool was great. And the best part was the beach where we spent most of our time. We did find this time that we needed to get up early to save seats if we wanted our front row spot under the palapa. Not a big deal as we all took turns. The weather also was great that week. Only one overcast day. Some of the new things added since our last visit a year ago was the beach party, don't miss it. We had so much fun dancing in the sand. Also the cooking lesson on the beach making the paella was good, and they serve drinks to you as you leave the beach around 4pm, all nice additions. It shows that they are always looking to make improvements. I have a hard time understanding some of the reviews that I've read about the food. We truly enjoyed all of the restaurants and we tried them all. There was always something for everyone. We did go back a second night to the steak house and were disappointed that they were out of the chateau briand. So don't go there late as we did that night. We had the sirloin and my husband and I didn't get a good cut. There was a lot of fat. Everyone else enjoyed theirs. A few musts to bring are of course your insulated mugs, lots of sunscreen, a night light as the rooms are very dark at night  plenty of ones for tipping. Also bring antibacterial handwash as we used it all day long. Think about it, everyone is touching those serving spoons. My husband got very sick at another resort a few years back and now swears by the handwash. No one got sick this vacation. We love this resort over others we've stayed at in the past for a few reasons. Only needing reservations at 2 of the restaurants, the size of the resort ( you don't need a shuttle bus to get around the resort), we like the rooms and the patio area as the outdoor furniture is made of metal not smelly cushions and lastly the fact that there are not a lot of wild birds roaming around at night (had 2 vacations that we didn't get any sleep as we had roosters and peacocks keeping us up all night) all at five star resorts. Lastly have to compliment the bartenders as we did our share of drinking. They sure do make good drinks. If you request mucho rum you will get it!! Marcos at the beach bar was our favorite. Every morning he would give us the local sports update with our drinks. The entertainment staff was great too!!! Thanks to everyone at the Majestic!! We truly love your resort and will be back!!

<Content>Applauso, applauso to the animation team I just returned home yesterday, June 7, from a week long stay at the Majestic Colonial. I am your average, middle class, hard working individual from Ohio, USA and I felt like I was living a dream. I went with a group of eleven, all couples except myself. This ended up lenghthy but it contains info. 1st time travelers to the Dominican or the Majestic might like. We all had Jr. Suites, which were very spacious and beautiful. The resorts website pictures really are what you are getting. The jacuzzi tub was awesome. The walk-in shower is HUGE. The room safe requires you to self-program a 4 digit code and was large enough for me to put my camera bag plus other valuables. There is lots of storage space which I suggest you make use of. Because of the humidity, clothing and bedsheets tend to get damp easily. I found that things that i had put away in drawers were less damp than things that I left out. The only negative I can say about the room was that the mattress was very hard. I requested a mattress topper but never got one or their idea of a mattress topper is not mine. I ended up sleeping on the couch for the last 5 nights because I found that it was actually very comfortable and I slept wonderfully. But from what I understand is that mattresses are harder down there everywhere.The resort is beautiful all the way around, the lobby, the pool, the beach. It is maintained well.We hung out at the pool near the pool/wet bar most of the time. Besides being served unlimited amounts of alcohol, (special thanks to William, Destelle, and Amaury for keeping the drinks coming and for always wearing a smile, Ya Baby!), that is where the animation team has activities. The vacation would not have been as fun without them. They get people involved through different games, aerobics and dance. I'm typically a shy person but I enjoyed both watching and participating in their activities. A extra special thanks to Francisco, Melvin, and Sandy for your friendliness and attentiveness to making my stay a memorable one. Advice to those who like to dance, do not wait to start learning the Taki, Taki or club dance. It is not typical line dancing which is repetitive. Parts of the dance repeats but it is changing throughout the whole song so if you really want to learn it, start on day one. I waited until like day 4 and only really learned about half of it. The animation team goes to the disco at night and around 12m they do the taki, taki. It is much more fun to participate if you know what you are doing. And to those of you who would not like all the activities, the pool is very long so i'm sure the other end of the pool is quiet. Our rooms were in building 2 and there is no pathway between the building and the pool. To walk the length of the pool to get to where you want to be, you have to go over bridges which can be kind of tiresome. I finally figured out to walk the length inside the building and exit where i wanted to be, much faster.The food was bad, good, to excellent depending on what you get and what your preferences are. There is more than enough variety to find things that you really like. One warning to Coke fans, they call Pepsi and Coke, cola, and they do not have Coke/Diet Coke, it's all Pepsi at the Majestic. I did discover the Mini Mart sold Diet Coke for $2 a bottle and by day 5, it was worth it. I got really tired of drinking Diet Pepsi and the water. Drinking the water is a necessity though to keep from getting dehydrated. I drank a lot of water compared to normal and I was still partially dehydrated. I did get sick with stomach cramping and diarrhea which kept me confined to my room one night. Almost everyone in our party got sick at one point or another and none of us (i don't think) could pinpoint a specific cause.The best tips i read before going were to take an insulated mug for your drinks and to take an inflatable raft. I kept my mug filled with water and drank as much water as alcohol. Next time I go I will take two mugs, one for each. Bubba kegs keep drinks cold quite awhile. I also enjoyed floating around on my raft a lot and heard in the minimart the lady trying to sell one for $20 US. The last day there i took the raft down to the pool to leave and someone had picked it up within 5 minutes. Another tip, write your name on your mugs and rafts.My opinion on tipping, I don't think the service would have changed much whether i tipped or did not tip. But because it is ingrained in me to tip when you get good service, that's what i did.And after I heard that i can make in one day what an average housekeeper makes in 1 month, I had no qualms about tipping. I tipped a dollar a day to the housekeeper, the person who stocked my mini-bar, to the server at meals and each bartender who served me during the day, and to anyone who transported my luggage.Tips on what kind of clothes to pack. Take more than one swimsuit because of the humidity they do not dry out fast. Take a cover-up to go to lunch in but do not try to go to the indoor buffet even slightly damp, they check to see if you are dry. Take one outfit for supper and the rest of the night. This does not have to be longer pants or even real nice unless you go to the 2 restaurants which require reservations. I saw several shorts and casual attire at the buffet and the outside restaurants. Take whatever you want to go eat breakfast in, you can wear this more than once because you are only in it for a short time. Unless you go out on excursions everyday, you really do not need play shorts and t-shirts. I took one for everyday and wore maybe a third of them.Some of us went on the ATV excursion. Lots of fun! And you end up at Macao Beach which is absolutely gorgeous with torquoise waters. Be prepared to get dirty though and wear older clothes.The weather is hot yet unpredictable. The staff said they could not count on their weather forecasts because one minute it could be sunny and the next it could be raining. They told us this is their rainy season and it did rain at least three of the days we were there. One time all afternoon and another all night.Other tips. Go to guest services right after checkin and make reservation for the 2 restaurants that require it. So discuss it before you get their. Also be prepared to schedule and pay for your excursions at the time you meet with your travel agency representative so discuss that too. If you go out the front entrance of the Majestic and go to the right, there is a shopping plaza within ten minute walk. Don't go though if you are not prepared to be haggled and to bargain for a decent price. I found the best way to deal with unwanted vendors is to say no gracias and keep moving. If you are going to the Majestic, have a great time.

<Content>so so resort My family and I travelled to Majestic Colonial In July 07. The resort is lovely, beautiful grounds, rooms and beaches very nice. The problem lies with the food/restaurants. Food is not good. Choices are horrible. Breakfast buffet closes at 10am, if you arrive at 10:01am you are out of luck. Each of the speciality a la carte restaurants features a buffet where you go and get your salads, appetizers, and desserts. The only item you are ordering is the main entree. So forget a long, relaxing dinner. They have you in and out very quickly. While we arent picky eaters, when we vacation we like a nice dinner. Sitting around enjoying conversation, good food and drinks. Not in and out in an hour.They also blast spanish disco music on the beach and by the pool all day. Not relaxing and if you dont care for this type of music it can be a drag to lye on the beach read a book and listen to the surf.

<Content>How Majestic! We just returned from The Majestic 2 weeks ago and , well, I can't say enough ... The trip was just fantastic!! It was our 25th anniversary and it couldn't have been any better! To start with, the traveling was just fine. No problems at all. And to have musicians playing as we deplaned (and also boarded on our way back) was a nice touch. Of course they wanted money so we slid a couple of bucks into their hat, but it was still very nice. The resort couldn't have been better. We did make a change in the beginning, however. The room, which was one of the more expensive rooms, did not have a very nice view of the ocean as we had hoped. Instead, it overlooked the scuba diving rental hut. Leave it to my wife to ask if they had any other rooms available. We did a little research first and found the room(s) we would prefer, went to the front desk and spoke to Roberto. He was the best. He, himself brought us around to look at a couple of rooms and we did end up with the room we wanted; Building #2, room 2344, overlooking the pool AND the ocean. How they did that we'll never know, because the resort was full. But we didn't ask. 2 other things we asked for was the CD player from the first room, and after seeing anniversary and honeymoon banners on several doors, asked for a Happy Anniversary banner on our door. The banner came almost immediately, and the CD player came the next day. Lastly, because we took a lesser room, we went back to the front desk to see if we could get something as compensation. We're really not pushy people, but we figured why not? We spoke to Franklin who gave us 2 30-minute massages for FREE! And, let me tell you, we were so happy -- and grateful!  As for the resort itself, it came as advertised. It was beautiful, and immaculate! The pool was wonderful, winding through the resort, and the beach was just anmazing, going on for miles. We took long walks down the beach everyday and never got past the 3rd or 4th resort. Our resort had 8 restaurants and 8 bars! We ate and drank all week, and made a few friends along the way from PA, KY, Chicago, and many from right here in Boston. Not to mention the people who worked right there at the resort. The waiters were great (Tomas, Eduardo, and Francisco) and the bartenders (William and Pablo). We had a lot of fun with all of them! As a matter of fact, on out last night, we saw Eduardo leaving for the night when we called out, Mi Amigo! He stopped walking and came right over to me and Tamy, gave us big hugs and told us to have a safe flight home! We were shocked. He could have blown us off, but took the time to come over. It's that type of friendliness you can't get everywhere. The swim-up pool bar with William was just so much fun. That's where we met most of the people on the first day. Some of whom we dined with later in the week. The lobby bar with Pablo was also a lot of fun.  Some people who wrote negative things about the food in the trip advisor must be hard to please. The food was plentiful, and very good. Some were better than others, but overall very good. The breakfast buffet at Supreme was fantastic, and depending on where you went, dinner was phenomenal! The Steak House was great. We got the Chateaux Briand twice and would recommend it to everyone. The Mexican/Dominican restaurant was also very good. But our favorite was the Teppenyaka restaurant. You needed reservations, and we didn't get to eat there until the last night, but it was well worth the wait. It was just amazing! Tamy works at a Sushi restaurant here at home, so when we say it was good, it's coming from people who eat sushi all the time. In summary, we both thought the Majestic was very, very good. Very clean (although some rooms -- we heard -- had a musty smell) with very good and friendly employees. The word of each day was Ola. Everywhere we went, all of the people who worked there would smile and say hello. We tipped a lot, which is the best thing to do. Bring plenty of ones, and tip everyone right from the beginning. You'll get much better service. The Dollar is 3 times greater than the peso so a dollar to them means a lot. That, we feel helped a lot, but they seemed genuinely very nice. Our room was always clean, always with flower petals in the tub, the fridge was always filled each day, and the bed made. You never saw a piece of paper on the grounds, nor a cigarette butt in the sand in the ashtrays. They went as far as to put an M in the sand in the ashtrays. We noticed a couple of times workers cleaning them and reforming the M. Again, we tipped $3 dollars per day, and also left notes asking for more water.  All-in-all, we had a blast and would go back in a heartbeat! We spoke to a couple of people from some of the other resorts. One who had come over to check out the Majestic, and another when we went to look at their resort. The first said her resort was fantastic, but after seeing ours, said she would stay at the Majestic next time. The other woman, who stayed at a resort down the beach that looked very nice, had many complaints. One of which was no hot water for 3 days. The only thing we had to worry about, and it had nothing to do with our resort, was to not drink the water and brush our teeth using the bottled water they provided every day. We also were told from Jama (our liason from VIP -- who was great) not to eat the salads, be careful not to eat some of the fruit, and to only have 2 pina coladas per day because of the coconut. Again, we know it's a country thing and had nothing to do with our resort. As I said to my wife -- and some of the people we spoke with about our trip when we got back -- we only had to worry about 3 things all week ... whether to go to the beach or the pool (we had beautiful weather ALL week), what we wanted to drink that day, and where we wanted to go for dinner! It doesn't get any better than that!!  I must also say we booked our trip through allinclusiveexperts.com and had Kathy as our agent. Everything she did for us was fantastic and I would recommend her to everyone wanting to go through an online travel agent. Between her help, a great resort, and a wonderful way to celebrate our 25th anniversary, we cannot be any happier!What an experience this trip was. The Majestic was just that ... Majestic!!

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful We have just returned from the Majestic where we spent a wonderful two weeks in the most incredible hotel. The staff were amazing right down to the painters and gardeners and they all look so smart in their different coloured uniforms. They all work so hard and yet are always so happy. The rooms are very spacious and grand and everything is spotlessly clean and tidy. The food in the Gormet restaurant is first class and they made my birthday so special with a lovely cake and a chorus of happy birthday. The food in the main buffet restaurant was also very good and plenty of choice. If we have to make one small complaint, it would be the steak house restaurant on the beach. The food is not very good, and presumably because it is open air, there are quite a few flies around the food at lunchtimes. The staff did not seem quite as friendly and be sure to ask for your steak well done when dining in the evening else it comes raw!. Anyway thats just a small complaint. The beach is beautiful and the sea warm with plenty of sun beds and umbrellas to go around. The gardens are immaculate and the pool is something to be seen. If you are thinking of taking children, probably think again, as this was more an upmarket couples and groups experience in our opinion where you can dress up in the evenings and relax to the sound of a jazz band or merengue the night away in the disco. (no english music) but hey if you want that then you holiday in England. The entertainments team were outstanding and what a fantastic performance of the Michael Jackson show. We had to watch it twice.Special thanks must go to Victor who works tirelessly in the bar at the quieter end of the pool, entertaining everyone with his yeah baby and amigaaa with this huge smile. We would definately go back to the Majestic without any doubts.Sue and Dougie from the UK

<Content>Wonderful Time-Awesome Resort! What an awesome resort! So beautiful!! The staff goes out of their way to make everything spotless. They are always cleaning, gardening, and making things gorgeous! The rooms were cleaned perfectly every day. The staff throughout was very courteous. We especially wanted to thank Denny, the concierge on the beach. Every time we were thirsty, there was Denny asking if we needed anything and he was always smiling and ready to bring us whatever we needed. He was awesome!! The food was good.. fresh, displayed nicely and we didn't get sick once, so don't believe the other reviews that say people were getting sick from the food (and I have a really sensitive stomach, so if I didn't get sick, no one will!!). There was always something we could find that we liked and usually, it was great! The chicken was always cooked thoroughly...even the vegetable dishes were awesome! We also ate at the Gourmet restaurant and the Japanese restaurant. Both were good but the Japanese was better. Finally, don't hesitate for a MINUTE to visit this beautiful resort! They really try hard to give you a good experience. The only thing we would change, would be to provide name brand liquor. The few bottles they did have, didn't seem to contain what the label showed? Everything else was GREAT!!!

<Content>May 23-31 My wife and I visited the Majestic the last week of May. The airport was hectic. Upon arriving, you buy a $10 tourist card and 1 minute later you hand it back in. This puzzled me as to why we didn't just give them the $10. The porters try to take your bags one you exit baggage claim. It takes several NO's to get them to leave you alone. If you have a prearranged transfer, it may take some time between waiting in line to hand in your voucher to get another voucher. It took us about 2 hours from the time we landed to the time we got to the Majestic(we had to drop others off at 2 other hotels) and get a separate voucher from the Prieto Tours agent. Check-in was easy, but nobody greeted us with a wet towel and the Majestic drink. I saw this done later in our stay. Rooms were clean and beautiful, but since the resort hallways are tiled, noise was an issue from the partiers coming in late and rolling suitcases when people were leaving the resort. Earplugs helped with that. Most of the staff was very friendly. Some employees always had a smile on their face as others seemed like they didn't want to be working. The food was my biggest problem. I didn't have many issues with my stay, but the food was worse than Golden Corral. The main restaurants were pretty good, but the buffets were bad. I left more food on my place than I ate. Throughout the week, I ate breakfast and lunch at both buffet restaurants (beach and the one attached to the lobby) when they first opened and the food was room temperature. Nothing was hot, except if they made an omelette or pasta to order. I ate spaghetti 3 days in a row at the beach restaurant since I nothing else tasted good. My wife went to another restaurant since she didn't like anything she ate at the buffet. Restaurant servers were great. Always removing finished dishes and replenishing the various beverage types(beer, soda, water, wine, mixed drinks). I found that tipping didn't do much to get extra service. We tipped our beach waitress once and never saw her for the rest of the day. We did tip our waiter (Blas) $50 who worked in the steakhouse. Always busting his tail and doing a great job with a smile on his face. The lobby and grounds are beautiful. Everybody is working to keep it up. Learning some basic Spanish helps to converse. Some employees don't speak but a few words of English. A must know phrase in Spanish is washcloth's please. We and others that I talked to rarely had washcloth's in our rooms. I couldn't figure out why some days we would and others we wouldn't. I would recommend this resort but would not give it a 5 star. I would say a very low 4 star would be appropriate. It is no Ritz Carlton which is a 5 star. The food was the only issue with the hotel. Enjoy your trip.

<Content>Best Trip Ever!!!!!!!!!! This trip was amazing, I have traveled all over the world inculding Colombia, Italy, France and Spain and this was by far the most fun and relaxing trip I ever had. It is the perfect trip for a family, group of friends or even for singles. When you get to the hotel there is someone there to give you a cold hand towel, drinks and a cookie. The service is amazing and the place is beautiful and clean. the beach was probly the best one i have ever been too and the water was warm and delightful. The workers are always smiling and happy. Some employes that sttod out were Keyla Reynoso and Sergie from the Front Desk. Roberto and Maria, the Bartendersin the Lobby was also amazing. Even the waitresses were outstanding. The one particular waitress that stood out was Samira Slcantara, she always had a smile and was a delight. All of these employes were some of the best i have ever came into contact with. This hotel and its employes made it the best trip of my life and i cant wait to go back in the winter.

<Content>Great Trip to the Majestic My wife and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana from April 27th to May 3rd. This was our third trip to Punta Cana in the past two years, with previous stays at Melia Caribe 鈥?Tropical and Excellence Punta Cana. We had another amazing time there and can鈥檛 wait to plan our next trip.I was a little disappointed with our very first experience in the lobby. We were offered towels but no cold drink! I was looking forward to the Majestic cocktail but it would have to wait until after we checked in. However, our room was ready for us and in a fantastic location, thanks to Richard for making it possible.The resort was set up very nicely and well-maintained by the grounds staff. I liked how the pool wound through the middle of the resort, with all four buildings essentially being nearby to pool access. There were ample bar locations to get a drink around the pool no matter where you were situated. I liked how the restaurants were split into two locations on opposite ends of the resort. The theater for the nightly shows fit in well at the corner of the resort by the shops, and the casino, disco and late night caf茅 were situated close enough to get to all three with ease as the night went on.The room was nice, we did not choose to do an upgrade since our room is mostly used for sleep and showering when we are on vacation, and we were not disappointed. I don鈥檛 think that either of us had a problem with the bed being uncomfortable, at least after we found some softer pillows in the closet. We didn鈥檛 have an issue, but I can see how people could be upset about the lack of privacy in the bathroom with either children or non-family around. Not much protecting you and the rest of the world in there. We loved having two sinks, the shower was very large, and the garden Jacuzzi was a nice touch. The TV had ESPN and some US channels, but I did miss Channel 21 from the Excellence.The restaurants exceeded my expectations at this resort. We ate a la carte every night and got breakfast and lunch at the buffet almost every morning. The selection at the buffet was better inside rather than near the beach, as the beach is only set up for a continental style breakfast and quick lunch items. The restaurants in order of personal preference from best to worst were (my choice): Steakhouse (chateaubriand), Gourmet (tenderloin), Seafood (lobster), Japanese, Chinese (lemon chicken), and Mexican (don鈥檛 remember). Compared to other DR AI鈥檚 the steak was actually perfect here. The two best restaurants for atmosphere were the steakhouse and seafood when the weather was nice. There was certainly no shortage of food.The pool and beach were about what I expected for the typical all inclusive in the DR, which is outstanding. I鈥檓 not sure if this pool was better than the Excellence though. It was definitely large enough to be away from the pool activities if you just wanted to relax. The water temp was perfect in my opinion especially in the hot sun. The beach was great, I wish they could have put a bar a little bit closer and staff some more with waiters on the beach, but it wasn鈥檛 that big of a deal. You could almost always find a hut if you wanted, even with all the inconsiderate people setting their stuff out in the AM to reserve a place for later.We caught a few shows but had seen them all before on our Honeymoon. They are great to see for the first time, except the magic show. I missed Michael Jackson this time which was the only one I wanted to see. But from what I did catch of the shows, the entertainment crew does a great job. Chris Blizzard had an awesome show at Excellence and I was disappointed to see that they didn鈥檛 have a show like that at Majestic. As far as the extras鈥?the photographers were out all day and there were a lot of photo ops. The shops were overpriced as usual on the resort, but head down the beach for your cigars and souvenirs and save 80% for the same stuff. Take the water taxi for $5. The disco was the best I鈥檝e been to in the DR, at least for the bar. Mini-bar was adequate although went two days without being stocked (yes our DND sign was off the door). Casino was fun, having Texas Hold-em made it the best so far. Front desk wouldn鈥檛 cash a travelers check in US $, so I just did it at the casino. I played golf one day at La Cana, see my review for more but it was amazing.I would recommend this resort and will return to the DR but probably try a new place because we鈥檝e been enjoying seeing as many resorts as possible.

<Content>Loved the Majestic I can't wait to return to the Majestic Colonial! My husband and i stayed for 5 days and can't understand how anybody can NOT have a good time at this resort. The animation team is awesome, the staff is great and the resort is beautiful. The food was just ok. It is a different country so i don't know what people are expecting, but there was always something that we found to be good. Miss the chicken wings....ummmmm and the TAki Taki! Already planning our next trip back!

<Content>Great Value  My wife and I have just returned from a 4 day destination wedding stay at the Majestic Colonial Hotel, Punta Cana, DR. The Majestic is one of many hotels along the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic and it鈥檚 hard to imagine a better deal for the money. Unlimited meals, drinks, and comfortable accommodations, with a 4 poster king size bed and a large Jacuzzi tub, for a little over a hundred dollars per person a day. White sandy beaches with concierge service, 9 bars, 7 restaurants, and a staff devoted to pleasing every guest, it was truly a delight. We knew it was something special when we arrived at the expansive open-air lobby and were greeted by a smiling hostess with a soothing Caribbean drink and a staff member with a refreshing moist wash cloth. Donald, the desk clerk who checked us in, deftly moved us to another room since our originally assigned accommodations were not ready. Paola, the desk clerk who checked us out was equally efficient and easy to work with. The staff members responsible for cleaning our rooms everyday worked extremely hard to make everything spic and span. The swan shaped towel with the orchard petal was a nice touch of class.There were plentiful pools to lounge around, take a quick dip in, engage in water exercises, and to just enjoy ourselves. The towel attendant, Bonito, was especially memorable, as he remembered me when I returned to exchange my towel for my towel card. The bartender at the bar closest to the towel pick up place was our favorite. He greeted everyone with a smile, a quick wit, and a savory drink. We were similarly treated as honored guests down on the beach where the beach concierge, Denny, patrolled the area with expedient conscientiousness. He made sure everyone had an opportunity to order a drink and he was quick to return to his guests with drinks in hand. Although we did not personally take advantage of the Spa or Casino, many of the other wedding guests did and all were impressed with the facilities and fun. There was also a wide range of free activities on the premises, including dance lessons, Spanish lessons, exercise classes, and fitness center. Off-site there was scuba diving and parasailing, among a vast array of other activities. The numerous restaurants provided us with a wide range of food choices. Breakfast was our favorite while dinner at the La Gourmet restaurant was our best nighttime meal. Coincidentally, our hostess at both restaurants was the same person, a testament to how hard working and attentive all of the staff are.Other than a few rough spots on the swim deck and some tennis courts that need an upgrade, there was nothing to fault. The grounds were beautiful, well attended to by an attentive staff, the staff was unfailingly courteous and hard working, and the overall experience was one that will be favorably remembered for years to come.

<Content>The food is not Majestic The rooms are very nice 鈥?spacious with a Jacuzzi, a sitting area and a balcony. Our room was in the middle of the property overlooking the pool. The grounds are beautiful. The beach is wonderful 鈥?clean, smooth sand, many palapas and chairs, some rocks in the water, but not troubling. The service on the beach is very nice. Denny, one of the beach servers, always had a smile on his face. The pool is spectacular. There are plenty of chairs and shade. The pool runs the entire length of the property, so you can find whatever atmosphere you want 鈥?the hustle  bustle of being near the pool bar and activities or a more quite spot.Our only complaints had to do with the restaurants. First, we were disappointed that of the two restaurants that needed reservations (Gourmet  Japanese) we could only get a reservation at the Gourmet. The breakfast buffet was very good 鈥?lots of variety, but nothing spectacular. The lunch buffets (one large in the main building and one at the beach) were disappointing and repetitive. The quality and service at the dinner restaurants was disappointing. The steakhouse was the exception regarding quality. There the food was quite good. The service, however, always seemed rushed.Overall, the hotel is very clean and quite beaultiful. The quality of the food and the service are areas in which there needs to be improvement.

<Content>Very Good Animation The animation group at the Majestic Colonial Resort in Punta Cana is excellent. Ivelisse, Maciel, Melvin, Leo, Walter and Jesus made our stadying much more enjoyable and productive. The resort has a fine cusine and delicius coctels, the personnel is very kidness and sociable. However, the animation team is marvelous. All the activities and the energy that they display in the realization of the games and contests is extraordinary. We laugh, excersice, dance, and enjoy each activity from the Taki taki dance in the beach to the steps in the water pool. Thank you guys and continuous with your excellent job. Monica  Carlos

<Content>Best vacation ever This is a lovely hotel with wonderful grounds and a fine gracious staff. The food is very good and there are lots of choices. The pool and the beach are just spectacular. The negative reviews are just silly. If you go to the Dominican Republic you might expect that the food choices might be somewhat different from home. Warm water seafood is not the same as North Atlantic! Having said that there was also plenty that was familiar and well prepared. Our party of 8 stayed in four junior suites for 8 days. The room was spotless each day. Our stay was just total heaven. Bright sun and cool breezes. The staff was very friendly and the service was good. We were able to find a good english speaker whenever we needed one and we also relied on our spanish speaking son to translate in a minor medical situation. The Medical staff was very helpful. We will be going back to the Majestic Elegance when it opens.

<Content>Not sure about these recent reviews... If you can't have a fantastic time at the Majestic, then you can't anywhere. My wife and I stayed at the resort May 22 - 28. We had a Colonial Jr Suite. When we arrived we had the drink, towel and cookie. I had previously sent some emails asking for a room in building 2 or 3 with a pool view and was told they would try. Well we ended up in building 4 with a full ocean view. It was absotuly beautiful. We had a huge private balcony with jaquzzi. The room itself was very nice as well. There is dark cherry colored wood that makes the room classy. The batrrom is open to the room with another jaquzzi seperating them. The toilet is behind its own door and then the shower has it's own door as well. The shower is huge, could fit 8 people in there if you wanted. There was a bottle of Champagne, Rum and Scotch in the room waiting for us. Which we took advantage of.We had NO problems with the food. I would say the buffets are average. Some things are good, some not. I think that's every buffet I have ever eaten at in my entire life. The restaurant's were very good. We enjoyed the fajita's at the Mexican/Dominican place. The SteakHouse was excellent. We had a great meal at the Gourmet place. We didn't try the Japanese place and the Seafood place was also average.The staff at the Majestic are incredible. We were greated with smiles and an hola everywhere we went. We befriended Pablo at the upstairs lobby bar. He makes a great Dirty Monkey, also try the P  B. We spent several evenings with him and the other patrons. We noticed many people don't tip the servers and bartenders here. We tipped everyone that helped us. I urge you to do the same.The weather was great the time we were there. Rained once for 30 minutes. The rest of the time was fun in the sun. The pool is awsome and the beach is one of the prettiest around. The Animation Team does a great job of keeping people involved in activities. They were all friendly, even if you declined to participate in an event.All in all, we had a great time, it just didn't last long enough. We would definitly love to come back. Be interested to see what the Majestic Elegance will offer once it is completed.

<Content>The Majestic Rocks!!! Date: May 29, 2008Reviewer: New York, NYI just got back from an amazing week at the Majestic (5/21-5/28)with two friends. We all had a fabulous time. Like all the reviews say, the grounds and the rooms are beautiful. The service was also great and everyone there spoke and understood english well enough so we could communicate with them. I am an extremely picky eater so I always worry about food, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good everything was. I ate at 6 of the hotel's 7 restaruants and enjoyed the food at all of them. The only thing that could have been better at the Majestic is the bed linen and the towels. Fabric softner makes all the difference in the world.Aside from the beautiful pools and beach, the thing the really made the trip memorable for me is the animation team-Tony, Pablo, Walter, Jesus, Leo, Melvin, Martinez, and Nina. They were all super friendly, very entertaining, and always made sure the guests had a good time. Overall, this was the nicest hotel I've stayed in so far and I've traveled quite a bit. The hotel had a well balanced mix of singles, couples and families with children of all ages. I would definitely go back to the Majestic and recommend it to friends.

<Content>Loved it! We absolutely loved our experience in Punta Cana.The hotel was so magnificent, romantic and the service was incredible. The hotel was clean, the food was great, very tasty and the drinks were endless.We met alot of wonderful staff members who made our trip so much fun we hope the next time we go we see them again.Ray from the entertainment group was by far our top guy, everytime we seen him around the resort he always made us feel happy, and gave us a good laugh. We always looked forward to seeing him in the evenings. Other staff such as Rapheal in the buffet restaurant and Pablo at the main lobby bar and Victor by the pool really gave great service and added to our experience.It was the staff and the total ambiance of the hotel that has my husband and I thinking and knowing we'll go back again. The only thing I would advise for this resort is that its so incredible that its not really for children, its more of a romantic retreat for a couple to reconnect and have fun.If your looking for a wonderful 'couple' type resort with good service and beautiful beaches, I would strongly advise this resort.

<Content>Amazing Resort- Definitely 5 Star Quality! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Majestic Dec. 13-Dec. 19 2007, and were blown away by the beauty of DR's land and water. This really is a 5 star resort with excellent customer service, good food (for an all-inclusive), wonderful rooms, and a great beach. I contacted the hotel prior to leaving and explained that this was our first vacation together and we wanted it to be special. I received no response to my email, and simply thought that the email had gone unheeded. However, when we arrived, they had upgraded us to an ocean view room and had champagne and chocolate waiting for us in the room. Such thoughtfullness!I cannot say it enough - what struck me the most about my DR experience was the staff. The Majestic staff possess the most amazing work ethic! They work tirelessly from sun up to sun down to serve hotel guests. Many do not live in the area, so they work for two - three weeks away from their families at the resort, then travel hours away to go home for a few short days. Be sure to thank them for all that they do and show your appreciation by tipping. Check-in was a breeze. We were greeted with a Majestic (orange dreamscicle) and showed our room. No problems whatsoever with our reservations. During check-in, I'd make reservations for the French restaurant and the Hibachi restaurant. A couple tips:Bring large insulated mugs to hold your cold beverage while you are on the beach. It will save you a bunch of trips to and from the bar. We got 64 oz ones with a lid and straw. That was a little overkill- we felt a little ridiculous and probably looked like MAJOR lushes.Bring a watch- the clock in your room shuts off when you leave it for more than an hour. (it beats having to turn the TV oon anytime you want to know what time it it) Plus, they are not big on clocks in the resort itself.Sign up for the ATV excursion. It was a blast although the peddlers were a bit pushy with their wares, but can you blame them? It is how they make their living. Also, the truck they send to pick you up at the hotel was a little scary. It looked like it was going to fall apart (I'm not exagerating). But, that just made it all the more interesting!The beach is gorgous- so definitely make an effort to one morning watch the sunrise on the beach. We saw it come up on kind of an overcast day, and it was still breathtaking. Women- it is windy, so be sure to bring a plethora of hair ties and hats.Try to learn some Spanish. It is their country after all! Most of the guests are European so some of the staff did not speak a lot of English. But it never posed a problem at all. That's about it. I guess the last bit of advice I can offer is to go into this experience with an open mind. It is an all-inclusive in a tropical setting- there may be a few bumps along the way. But, it is an amazing resort for the price. I'd absolutely reccommend it, and we do plan on returning.

<Content>We loved the Majestic I spend one week for my honeymoon at the majestic and it was incredible. My wife and I got married in Dec 15, 2007 and flew to Punta cana the 16th. When the shuttle we had schedule took us there we had to see different hotels of the people we were letting off and let me tell you just the receiving in the majestic is different. They have a cold towel waiting for you, they have a fruit punch or something so you feel welcome. If you have a Premium room, you make the check in in a special place of the lobby, if not the line wasn鈥檛 that bad.We stayed at the Colonial Suite (I think that鈥檚 the name) and it was awesome. We had a huge living room with tv, sofa, loveseat, a small table, fridge and it was really nice for romantic nights out of the actual master room. From there we had to sliding doors, one to the private, Jacuzzi roof top balcony, and another for the double size traditional balcony. This balcony also connect to the master room. Obviously, it had a King bed, but we had a whirlpool for two waiting with roses an bubbles on it, plus a champagne bottle. The bathroom was incredible too.The food wasn鈥檛 the best I have had in my life but it was a lot, and different variety so you can choose. The pool was amazing, it was so big, we never felt claustrophobic feelings.The only problem occurred because one day they decided to replace some furniture in the room, and we had to stay out of the room for a couple of hours. After a while I thought it was to much time, so I went to the front desk and in half an hour they were out of our room. But to our surprise there were fruits and Champagne waiting for us in the room. The other weird thing is there is no way of locking employees out of the room. There is no old time lock that can only be opened from the inside. So if you are doing something private in your room of in the private balcony I will suggest that you hang a sign in the door or at least close the door between the living room and were you are.They have an animation team that was pretty cool, but we were more in a romantic mood. So every night they have live music outside with bands of jazz, merengue, oldies, and others. We appreciate this a lot because we could dance romantically. My last comment, if you want to have fun and be in a party hotel, this is not the one for you. But if you want a romantic getaway this one is perfect. We are going back for the first anniversary in December.

<Content>An Honest Review鈥?#x201d; Well to start off I will no t speak much about my trip to and from the Hotel because everything was flawless due to my travel agent 鈥?the real review is of the hotel. The best phrase to describe the Resort is 鈥淛ack of all trades, master of none鈥? The resort has everything in one small space, but none of them are excellent due to the many different rolls each play.I went on a small vacation from May 23 to May 27, 2008. The purpose of the vacation was due to a surprise marriage proposal. After extended research in this site and other sites I had planned everything so that this trip would be flawless; the variable I was not counting on was the Resort. When I get there they receive me and my girlfriend with a towel, drinks and cookies; very nice; then I go to the front desk and the check in was done within a few minutes, excellent!!! And then things went wrong鈥?I get to my room and I notice that they, mistakenly, had given me a standard room even though I had paid and reserved an upgraded room (Colonial Jr. Suite 鈥?jacuzzi in the balcony) five months in advance. They were very prompt in admitting the mistake, but they told me that they did not have that room available; then why do reservations exist? I had to stay in a standard room for a day. Anywho, I didn鈥檛 care much because I was there to enjoy my vacation at all costs. The same day of my arrival I went to make reservations for the restaurants and for a dinner in the beach (for my proposal), but to my surprise there was no availability for the things I wanted 鈥?the French restaurant was available but who wants to go there after the awful things read about the place, plus is French food in the DR. So, defeated in everything I had planned before I impromptu some new plans of my own and a new proposal was set. The second day I got the correct room I had reserved 5 months in advance and everything was well; but the food鈥?Me and my girl were a bit shocked about the food. I am the type of person that would eat anything, if you season a rock well I will eat it. The Steak restaurant, by far, was the best, and then followed the buffet restaurants. The buffets were good because you could try things and if they were not good then you just didn鈥檛 eat them and pick new things (trial and error). The absolute worst was the seafood place. In the restaurant you had to pick from a menu 鈥?I was amazed, everything was bad 鈥?I did not know it was possible to ruin garlic shrimp (camarones al ajillo), since its only butter and garlic, but now I know is possible. When I was there I was expecting to eat Mangu (a traditional Dominican dish) but none was found, a bit intrigued by this. So, we asked one of the waiters why the food was so awful and why they did not have Mangu in none of the restaurants; and he sincerely told us that recent changes were due to new European management, rather than Dominican. (Hmmm, no opinions, don鈥檛 know who to blame)To conclude, I did not get sick eating the food (my college years made this stomach invincible) but it was not enjoyable, except for the steak house. The hotel is beautiful, but not a five star resort as advertised. I would like to know who gave the hotel five stars and the criteria鈥檚 used. Rooms were nice and spacious, but nothing out of the ordinary in DR. Nice pool and beach, but, again, nothing out of the ordinary. The staff and the people is what really make this hotel. The staff is always courteous and friendly, and even the people staying there make this place fun. Since me and my girl are fully bilingual, we made many new friendships with the staff and fellow travelers. Overall, for the price, this resort is OK and entertaining, but for a 鈥渇ive star resort鈥?as advertised, is not good. My advice to the hotel is to lower the stars so that the expectations are also lowered, or get new management that will make specialties and masters at something, rather than a lot of average things; like they say: it鈥檚 not quantity is quality. My advice to travelers is that if you have a reservation to go there, then go, you will have a good time with the right attitude; but if you are not set to go, then do not go. Well as a new engaged man, I鈥檒l tell you that I will not be returning to this hotel; even though the hotel is now part of a story in my life. There are just way too many options to explore and new 鈥渇ive star鈥?hotels opening each year in DR to pick an average one. If you have any questions regarding my trip let me know, I just got back and the info is fresh... happy travels to all

<Content>NeverAgain Room - Very nice, large, very noisy, no door on the bathroom.Mini-bar isn't - Only soda and two beers.Drinks - No alcohol REALLY! you must ask for alcohol and watch carefully to make sure they put in more than 1/4 oz.No FREE brand name alcohol. Name you never heard of with a flavor to match.Ground - BeautifulFood - Fair to Poor. A lot of breading, little meat. Over cooked and staff as a hard time understanding English. Most of the time they bring the wrong item - although thay are very nice about it.NOT RECOMMENDED!

<Content>Loved our vacation at the Majestic Colonial The Majestic Colonial was recom. by my nephew and niece. They were there on their honeymoon 11/07. My husband and I don't particularly like all inclusives but this resort was a pleasant surprise. The grounds were beautiful. The bars (although not all of them were open at the same time) were well stocked and the bartenders were very friendly. The restaurants were the biggest surprise. The food at the buffet supreme restaurant was top notch for a buffet and also air conditioned. We went there for breakfast, lunch and dinner, it was that good. The rodeo restaurant (for steaks) was also great. The japanese restaurant was okay. No big show but they grilled up beef, chicken, shrimp, fish and friend rice. Atmosphere is nice and it is airconditioned. My suggestion is to go to the beach and get yourself a hut before 10 am. It gets really hot down there so you need to have some place for shade. The best beach conceirge was Denny. He knew what you wanted even before you did. He is top notch and works hard in that heat just for you. We had a first floor garden view room. Great location but the room always smelled very musty. My nephew had the same issue in November and requested another room on the top floor. We just stayed in this room and sprayed cologne to mask the smell.  The casino opens at 4 pm, for slots only. It is a very small casino with two roulette tables, poker tables, slots etc.  The shows at night left a little to be desired. Very high schoolish. Overall the entertainment staff had a tough job, they were up for hours trying to entertain the guests. We have no kids so I cant really say what there is to do for kids. Bring alot of single $1. Even though this was an all inclusive resort, a little tip now an then really goes a long way. The beer on tap is Presidente and the tap lines are very clean, we did not get sick at all. The mixed drinks were good. You can get higher end liquor if you want to pay about $3-$6 for it. You can also order better bottles of wine in any of the restaurants. Look on the carts when you go into the restaurant, you can just sign it to the room. The Sommelier, Christian is really nice and knows his stuff. Whatever you do, get to the airport about 3 hours ahead of time. You will have four lines to work your way through. The first line they will go through your bag. The second, you will go to the airline and get your boarding pass and/or check your bag. Make sure it does not go over 50 lbs, they will charge you. The third line is customs and the fourth line is security. When we were there this past Saturday, there was only one security lane open - it was nuts. There is a Wendy's and pizza place in the airport, you can eat there and get some beer while you wait to board your plane. It is better to get their early and hang out. The overal vacation was really great. This is by far one of the nicest resorts to go to. The locals say this one is the best one to be a guest in.  Have a great time - C  D, New York

<Content>Great resort, EXCEPT for administration and front desk We were there for the last week of April 2008 for my daughter's wedding. The whole thing was booked well in advance in October 2007 and the wedding was arranged through their wedding coordinator. Rooms and wedding arrangements were confirmed by the resort in December.On the first day while checking, the only people who got the room they requested and payed for was the bride and groom and their baby.We were supposed to have the Majestic Colonial suite, got a junior suite with no explanation. We had to argue, show all the documentations, and waisted 2 hrs to explaine the error and got our room the next afternoon. Everybody else were bump to an other resort. It took hours of arguments, frustations, and pleading by my daugther and son inlaw to finally get everybody moved to the resort in time for the wedding. Not the best way to start a vacation / wedding.We were not the only one. It seems the resort was way overbooked that week. My guess, it was caused by a very large wedding during the weekend ( I doubt this was booked early ), which somehow bump out people who booked their trip earlier.Bottom line, very poor administration and front desk service at this resort.Top 5 for everything else ( food, service, drink, etc ). Too bad for the rest of the resort staff who puts 100 % in their work have to suffer for it.

<Content>loved the majestic Hi we returned from the Majestic colonial on May 4,2008 after a week stay.My husband,daughter and I were down to attend our son's wedding. We booked last septand paid 5300.oo for this resort.Our trip down,arrival at airport and ride to resort was wonderful.We were greeted at the resort with friendly faces,a delious drink and cool refreshing towels, Then we took our turn at the desk to check in to find we were bumped to the resort next door,The Bahia Principe for that day and night.and to come backthe next day at 1,After waiting to see our son and grandchild for 9months.this was a shock.They provided a cab over to the next resort and said they wouldn't pay for any other cabs except the one returning the next day.So we paid our own cabs over and back to visit,Not only we were bumped but also the maid of honors room,the bestman's room.and my daughter's.They apologized and gave us a list of compensations of which we only used 2 a massage and free internet. Another couple that was bumped got a free week there,they only have to pay for there airfare,I heard they were lawyers. No matter what,this should of never happened,the bumped file had hundreds of names in it.So beware if they would do it to a wedding party,it could happen to anyone. Once we were settled in our room the next day everything went fine. We requested a 2nd floor room in building 3 and was given our request.The beds were great,the open concept took a little getting use to,we had alot of ants,but didn't bother complaining,we just didn't use the coffee pot and kept everything in our suitcases. The rooms were spotless cleaned in the morning and again in the evening.The only thing we didn't get a facecloth the whole week,but after reading this in previous reviews I had brought my own, I have to say Richard,Victorhotel managerand Paeola were fantastic.The grounds were spotless,the pool was beautiful,and the food wasn't bad at all.I can't believe the bad reviews about the food,We are very fussy eaters and we enjoyed alot of great tasting food.Breakfast at the main buffet was incrediable,I myself would rather eating from the buffet instead of the alacaretes but the rest loved most of the meals they provided.The entertainment wasn't great but there were so many other great things to see and do it was no big deal. The location of the resort is quite away from the airport and due to a real bad storm a year or more ago the water is very ruff,I think there was only 1 day the parasailing and catamareans were allowed out,friends of ours were down the beach 15 resorts and there water was very calm.In closing the resort,food.workers were awsome.but would probably not go back,unless we paid alot less only because of being bumped and the rough section of the sea.

<Author>FunVacation
<Content>Beautiful resort, great service! We stayed at the Majestic May 2008. I was concerned about the reviews regarding sickness and the overbooking issue.We were greeted with a welcome drink, wet cool wash cloth and the friendly staff at the Majestic.I e-mailed Richard prior to our visit - Thank you Richard...we had a great room in a great location!! Our room was exactly what we hoped for. The bathroom situation didn't bother us. We had no bugs in our room...just a few flies now and then on the balcony.We have been to many resorts and this resort was small compared to most of the resorts we have stayed at. The way the resort is set up, it is not a far walk from anywhere to anywhere within the resort.We go in May to avoid crowds. I was VERY worried about a full/overbooked resort. If this resort was full, you would never know. The restaurants were never crowded (except the 2 restaurants that required reservations - we had to wait 5 nights to get an early dinner at the gourmet and had no interest in the Japanese but we were told that we could not get an early dinner there either). The beach never felt crowded. We did not go to the pool, but it looked like by mid afternoon, the chairs were all taken. The entire resort did not feel crowded at any time.Grounds 鈥?Beautifully manicured, throughout the day there were people working hard to keep the resort looking beautiful. The resort was very clean.Beach/ocean - The beach was beautiful. I get up early so never had a problem getting a chair in the shade. The staff works hard cleaning the seaweed that washes up on the shore and picking up garbage that inconsiderate tourists can not put in a trash can. You can take a long walk in either direction鈥?the beach goes on forever!! The ocean was pretty clear, not crystal clear but clear. The ocean had some waves鈥ot too rough, but not calm either. Service - The service at this resort is the best service we ever received from check in to check out and everyone in between. We were always greeted with a smile and Hola by the entire staff. Housekeeping was great, mini-bar (asked for specifics and got what we asked for). Restaurants鈥?service was also great. Never had to wait too long for a drink at any of the bars. Food - Along with all kinds of food and drinks, we ate salad and fruit every day.....we did not get sick.Buffet -We ate breakfast and lunch at the buffets. The service at both was great. We were greeted and escorted to a table when we walked in. The entire staff at the buffets was great鈥 special thank you to Giullermina.....we miss your smile!!. The food trays were labeled. There were various stations that prepare food for you while you wait鈥?that was basically what we ate. I tried some of the food in the trays鈥ome was ok some wasn鈥檛. They had a variety of food鈥on鈥檛 think anyone would go hungry. The buffet food was 鈥?ok鈥鈥檇 say it is comparable to other all inclusive buffets in the same price range/star rating.Steakhouse / Seafood Restaurant 鈥?The steakhouse was good 鈥?we ate there 2 nights. We had the filet mignon and another steak which were both very good. The seafood restaurant was also good 鈥?we ate there 3 nights. We had the lobster which was good 鈥?it is different than Maine lobster, but still good. These two restaurants share the same building and the same staff. We had great service at both restaurants 鈥?special thanks to Domingo鈥ope to see you again some day!!Gourmet Restaurant鈥?service was ok鈥ood was a disappointment.This is a beautiful resort with great service. This would be our first choice for future vacations if the resort would improve on the variety/selection at the al la carte restaurants. The main course at the steakhouse and seafood restaurants were good but if I could make a suggestion鈥?.Instead of having a limited appetizer/salad selection on the menu, it would be great if there was an appetizer/salad bar. We have been to several resorts that now offer an appetizer buffet and it is great!!Thanks Majestic鈥︹€?we really enjoyed our visit.I鈥檇 be happy to any questions regarding our trip to the Majestic.Boston

<Author>burntbabe101
<Content>awesome my family and I have been to a number of all inclusive resorts in the caribbean and this most certainly was one of the best. Let's start with all the good things the hotel has to offer.First things first, the food:i can not comprehend how anyone can complain..there is so much of it and its good too! the breakfast buffet was by far my favorite, eggs done every away imaginable, and the bread and pastry table is amazing. you truly have to be the ultimate picky eater not to find something enjoyable to eat. the mexican and japanese restaurants were our favorite. on to the beach and pool:GORGEOUS! The premises of the hotel are gorgeous overall with the various lakes and fountains, along with the two floor lobby. what i didn't like: the bathroom in the room. perhaps privacy is overrated. the frosted glass is poorly frosted and you can see EVERYTHING..the doors only go 3/4 up so everyone in the room can hear and smell what you are up to...the shower is pretty spacious and gives enough room for changing clothes. the night shows weren't especially amusing with the exception of the stars are here show, magic show, and ultimate couple show.the animation and taki taki dance can lift anyones spirits.overall a great hotel and a great vacation!

<Content>Ola mi amor! This was my first time to any resort on any island and my first time enjoying an all inclusive vacation. I have to say that for my first experience, I have raised the bar very high! I went for my friends' (Blaire and Benny) wedding and it was absolutely beautiful~!! It was breathtaking as I watched the stunning bride walk down the sandy isle lined in palm to meet her handsome husband. With the clear blue ocean in the background, the wedding photos look spectacular!At this resort, the environment is classy and luxurious. I was spoiled all day , everyday, by all the people that worked at the resort. The waiters (Pablo), the bartenders (Maximo, Jordan), room service (Starlin) were all up to par. The food was delicious and the mid-night chicken wings served by Hanison were the snack of choice! I highly recommend Mono Sucio (Dirty Monkey) as the beverage of choice . . . mmmm! The Animation Team (Rey, Anthony, Nina, Leo, Walter, Martires, and Melvin) were all sweet and more than friendly as they kept us entertained with games, competitions and the Taki Taki dance. The disco was fun when the latin music was playing and the animation team was around to dance with. Ater 1am (early) it died down and was less entertaining.Mid week, we took a trip to Hiquey via taxi and had a wonderful time bargaining for some paintings and jewellery to take home with us. The kids on the street were adorable and everyone we met was friendly! Our taxi/chauffeur was very curtious and patient as he waited and waited till we were satisfied with the prices we had to pay and the purchases we made. Room cleaning was ok, nothing spectacular. After leaving large tips, we had some hibiscus flowers left around our sink and tub.The shows were spectacular!! And the theatre was very comfortable. I was impressed with style of the resort in general.I recommend checking out the snorkling (even just in the area that everyone swims in); doing yoga on the beach in the morning and spending a night at the Mangu Nightclub about 15 minutes away via taxi. Bring some good sunscreen (the sun is HOT).Everyday on the beach, there was a photographer with animals from the zoo that you can pose with. The shots are awesome but beware because the photo shop has bad customer service and the prices are a rip off! Aside from those people, everyone else at the resort made sure were comfortable and well taken care of. I'm sure you will have a wonderful vacation at the Majestic!Cheers!Lidia - lovinlids@hotmail.com

<Content>Glorious Week at the Majestic My husband and I just returned from our fabulous week at the Majestic Colonial. I want to especially thank Victor for taking such terrific care of us and for being so accommodating during check-in.The grounds and pool area are absolutely beautiful; it is like being in paradise and was one of our most relaxing weeks we have ever spent away. The resort itself is large but not too large to find you way around. After a day everything fell together and we were able to navigate our way around without any problems.Our room was in Building 2 overlooking the pool and was so roomy with a walk-in shower and very, very clean; no bugs, no air conditioning problems and no musty smell. I brought air fresheners but never had to use them. Also, our clothes never felt damp as others have complained about. We enjoyed our mimosas for breakfast every morning and freshly made omeletes. The morning pastries were always just made and one was better than the other. The Chateaubriand in the Rodeo Grill was excellent as well as the lobster. We enjoyed the Japanese restaurant as well as the Le Gourmet. Reservations are required but not impossible to get. The service was the best.The beach is really like a paradise. We always found a palapas and enjoyed watching the many weddings almost daily. The entertainment at night was just so so but we won a little each night in the casino. The casino isn't very large but we had a good time.The beach party on Wednesday night turned out to be a lot of fun. We were glad we didn't leave with the few drops of rain. The dancers were amazing.This was the first time we went away with friends, Deneen and Gary and really enjoyed the week with them. They were a lot of fun. We did our own thing during the day and met up for dinner and the shows. This was their first time at an all inclusive and they are already talking about going back next year. While I feel bad about travelers who didn't fair so well for their vacation, we can't complain about anything. We were always very careful not to drink the water and we didn't eat anything that didn't look fresh. I brought a wide assortment of medicinal remedys and thankfully didn't have to use any of them, not even an Advil.The Dominican Republic people work extremely hard but still always greet you with a smile. A lot more than you get from workers here in the United States.All of our servers were great, especially Claudia in the Japanese restaurant and Denny on the beach who made endless trips to keep everyone hydrated. I didn't make note of all their names but each and everyone we encountered was very pleasant.We loved this vacation and are hoping to go back next year, if not sooner.

<Content>Beautiful resort, amazing staff We were at the Majestic from May 11th to the 18th. We were a group of 20 that travelled for our son's wedding. We all had a great time. The pool is amazing, it's huge. We never had any trouble finding a hut at the beach, no need to reserve. The food was very good. We thought the Gourmet restaurant was the best. We tried the Chinese, Mexican, the steakhouse and the buffet all were very good. The vast selection for breakfast was incredible, crepes, waffles, pancakes, omelets etc... and those chocolate croissants, irresistible. The rooms are very nice, lots of space. The staff is amazing, they always go out of their way to greet you. We had 3 teenagers traveling with us and they became friends with Walter, he was so nice. He would be so happy when he would see us. He was sad to see us leave. I have to say thatWalter is #1, yaaa baby. The rest of the animation team, Pablo, Rey, Tony, also did a wonderful job of entertaining us. Overall, our experience at the Majestic was wonderful, none of us would hesitate to return. If you are planning on travelling to The Majestic you won't be disappointed.The O'Brien familyOntario, Canada

<Content>Don't believe everything you read My wife and I spent our 10th anniversary at Majestic from 5/17 through 5/24. I don鈥檛 want to repeat the other reviews, so I will not go into any great detail about the grounds, pool or ocean. I believe that almost all reviews (positive and negative) talk about how wonderful they are. My wife鈥檚 quote after first reaching the room was that the Majestic was 鈥渢he most beautiful place we have been鈥? I should say that we have traveled extensively throughout the Caribbean over the last 14 years. It has been a mixture of resorts and cruising totaling more than 12 islands. The one thing I do want to mention other than food is the service. The shower head in our room disconnected from the wall the first night. There are two shower heads, so we were both able to shower. The next morning we stopped by guest services to report the problem. They were there to repair it within 45 minutes.My main goal here is to review the food. I read some reviews before getting there that talked about bad food and lack of choices. I鈥檓 not sure what those people were describing, but my guess is that they expect their food to be chewed for them. We tried all the restaurants except the ones requiring reservations, and were never dissatisfied. I am a very, very picky eater. I don鈥檛鈥?like many things, but I never had a problem. I only ate the same thing twice when I chose to. We ate breakfast and lunch in the Supreme buffet (close to the lobby) everyday. There were too many items to choose from. We both spent about five minutes just walking from section to section deciding what to eat.The food is not perfect, and some things were better than others, but nothing was bad. My least favorite restaurant was the seafood. We ate there twice during the week. We both had the lobster, the first visit. I had the grouper on the second visit, and my wife had the shrimp. I did not care for the smoky flavor from the grill on the lobster or the grouper. The food was good, but the smoke over powered the flavor of the food itself. The Mahi Mahi nems were one of my wife鈥檚 favorite items at any of the restaurants.I also tried the burger at the buffet one day. I do not recommend this, or if you do be sure to say well done. Mine was a deep pink when I reached the center. I immediately stopped eating, but I never got sick. Our local travel rep also warned us about the salads. We did not eat any, but I saw people at every meal enjoying them. Her concern was that the lettuce was not washed with purified water. Since I did not try a salad, I cannot say one way or the other.I should also add that my wife is from Puerto Rico, and Spanish is her first language. The Spanish gave us a bit of an advantage, but remember that a smile and 鈥渉ola鈥?goes a long way. Even if you are grammatically incorrect, or the accent is bad, it is very much appreciated. I tested this on Maximo at the lobby bar when I was alone. I gave him my best broken Spanish with a smile, and he was very welcoming, and made me the crazy 鈥淛ames Bond鈥?martini that I ordered. (That鈥檚 a mix of 3 parts gin to 1 part vodka for any that are interested) Tip this guy when you order, he鈥檚 a great guy and will make you a great drink.I will end by saying that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and what is good for me may not be good for the next person. Use some common sense with your eating and drinking. If your body is not used to eating three big meals, and drinking all day in the hot sun, you will probably feel bad at some point, but it鈥檚 not the fault of the resort.

<Content>don't go for the food! Just came back from this resort May 16 - 22, 2008. The most beautiful pool  beach. The resort workers are very friendly that I will say. However, what you have read about the food is correct. Flies are everywhere in the restaurants, my boyfriend is still sick from being sick into our third day into our trip. The only good place to eat dinner is in the Japanese restaurant. The food is cooked in front of you and they are very generous with the portion sizes there. Steakhouse was just ok. The rooms are beautiful except for the fact of the bathroom you have absolutely no space in there. We did have one incident where I found a roach in the room @ midnight one night. We immediately went to the front desk and was told that someone would come up to spray. I'm sorry, but I was not comfortable with that answer. Yes, the desk clerk changed our room from a King - to two double beds! Go figure that - the bellman who help us with our luggage realized that that was not the right thing to do. Five minutes later the front desk called us to tell us they will put us in a room with a king size bed - why he could not do that the first time is beyond me. Anyway, the room he put us in, had ants crawling all over the phone. We were too exhausted to change again, however they did come to spray the next day. If you notice in the maid's cart, they have roach spray. ugh....was not happy to see that. Again, as everyone says remember to bring $1 bills for tips. We tipped everyone - they work very hard there to make your stay as pleasant as possible. If you want to go to they gym - Don't!! It smells so bad and plus most of the equiptment is broken. And the casino smells as well, and the staff there is not friendly at all!!Make sure that you come with all your personal items as the gift shop there is very, very expensive!! $10.00 for a tube of toothpaste and $6.00 for a toothbrush!! Sorry, but...I don't think I would go back there again. I would think about booking this resort for your vacation.

<Content>As It Is .....No Bull Mike, Jayne, Rob, Sarah 49yrs, 49yrs, 53yrs 40yrsI stayed with my wife and two friends in Sept 2007 The place and grounds are very impressive The food in the main restaurant was sound get it cooked in front of you , place clean plenty of choice and the main bosses are situated here and it show's in the service cleaniness, everything, once we had worked this out it was the only place we ate, believe me it was down to one American boss who stood at the door and who made sure it was right from the minute you walked in.The lads and lasses serving were brilliant and yes we bowled them a couple of dollars in the guise of a handshake everytime we went in ,so did my mate and his wifeThe French and Japanese restaurants were fine and we enjoyed them everytimeThe Beach restaurant was not run corectly, during the day the food was out and if there were flies on it , there were flies on it, no one was in the slightest bit interested, but people still ate there.All but one of our party had the screaming ab dabs and so did many more, at night was no different the food came cold and poorly presented and you knew you would get no joy complaining and as Orson Welles once said  and still they came I went there one night with an Columbian lad who had been moved to American as a child, his Spanish was fluent and they seemed to respect him because of th Columbian connection, best meal I had there, it was all down to a total lack of management, good place to go for a drink day/nightMy wife wants me to add she went to the shop on the camp and the young girls at the till had eight mobiles which they were inspecting all different typesThe drinks were fine again bowl the lad three $ when you go in and believe you'll have to tell him to stop pouringBrilliant holiday, I'd go back tomorrow , I'd just avoid the beach restaurants for food

<Content>please read My husband and I just returned from a week at the majestic colonial. We stayed from may 11 - may 18. I would like to start by how beautiful the place was. The weather was terrific. A nice breeze and never humid. The beach was gorgeous the animation team was excellent. Soo much fun. HOWEVER, The food not so good. I am not a fussy eater or a stuck up person hoping to get more than what we payed for. The steakhouse was really good. The gourmet was average. We wouldn't know about the Japanese because our 4th day there my husband got food poisioining. I was a little sick but nothing a day in bed didn't fix. But my husband was deathly ill.I had to go to the doctor on the premises. For a small fortune they will give you some pills to take and pedialite. Nothing helped. We spent the last 3 days in bed.My husband lost 8 pounds I lost 4. Not what you expect when you go to an all exclusive resort. We were very careful with the water and food. I didn't eat anything that didn't look right or anything i had seen previously at lunch, Which is the case with most of the buffet items. The first day back my husband spent the day at the doctors to find out the very expensive pills were nothing but sugar pills. Be very careful. This is one resort I would not return to.

<Content>Sad...but TRUE!! Although,I've been using this site for a few years,I never thought to take the time to write a review until now.I just returned from a vacation at the Majestic Hotel(May 19th-May 22th).I must admit this is the worst Hotels I ever stayed at.In short let me say,The grounds,pool,and Beach are beautiful.The Food is horrible.I didn't get sick but the hot food was cold and the cold food was not cold.I've been to the Caribbean many times and I never experienced soo many flies hanging on the food.It was disgusting and I feel management needs to address this.Alot of selections,had no labels and when food pans got low,the staff was slow to refill.I took the advice to bring many $1 dollar bills to tip but it didn't seem to help.I found the drinks to be very weak and limited in knowing how to make certain drinks.I would never return to this Hotel and suggest if you are considering this place to look elsewhere.

<Content>Amazing Paradise We vacationed at the Majestic May 14-21, 2008. This was my second time at the DR and our experience at the Majestic was absolutely amazing. Contrary to previous reviews, our cab ride to the resort was approximately 45 minutes with a couple of stops, and the cab ride back to the airport was about 30 minutes. Both cabs had the air conditioning cranked up. Be prepared for an interesting ride. Upon arrival, we were greeted with coctails and after about 15 minutes we were on our way to our room. Our room was absolutely amazing. We requested a second floor room on the non-construction side of the resort. Although, we didn't hear the construction the entire trip, I did finally notice people working on the addition the last couple days of our stay. Our room and the entire resort is immaculate. The pools are amazing and the beach is just as beutiful as the pictures on their web page. I'm not sure where the previous reviewer stayed, but our room was actually so cold we needed extra blankets. Also, all the main restaurants are air conditioned as well. There was such a nice breeze the entire week we stayed there, even the open-air bars and restaurants were very comfortable. We didn't notice any more bugs than what you would expect in 90-degree weather. There were no bugs in our room either.I didn't use any bug spray the entire week and I think I may have had two bites on my ankle the entire time.I would suggest making reservations on the first day for the French and Japeneese restaurants. We ate at the steak house, Mexican, Japeneese, and the main buffet (Supremo). We liked the steak house and Japaneese restaurants the best, they were excellent. The buffets for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, have a huge variety and many different options. They have many chefs available at the buffets to cook your food made-to-order, which is my recommendation.We went to several shows, the casino, the disco, and a movie one night. We also walked on the beach one night, which was very nice. The shows are entertaining and the dealers at the casino were a lot of fun (Juan Carla - Pit boss, dealers - Josie, danny, lucy). We also had a lot of fun with the animation team (Jesus, Melvin, Tony). I had an on-going ping pong battle with Jesus and Melvin. We had so much fun!We didn't go on any excursions, but we met people that had fun on several of them. We did go boogie boarding at the beach and snorkeling. We walked down the beach about a mile (to the left of the resort if you are looking at the water) and the waves were 3-5 feet. Again, we had so much fun.The resort also has professional photographers that take amazing pictures. There is no obligation for the shoot, which consists of almost 100 pictures taken all over the resort. You can purchase individual pictures for very reasonable prices (i.e. $10 for 5 X 7) or put them on a CD so you print as many as you want later. I would definitely recommend it. They are located right next to the casino.As you can tell, I would definitely go back to the Majestic!!!!!

<Content>Almost Perfect This will be a fairly short review as most of you will have read plenty of others,which will have given you a good idea of what to expect.The Hotel itself and the grounds are indeed beautiful,and there are teams of gardners and maintenance people keeping everthing in good order.The Pool is the best I have ever seen,and for anyone who has never been to Punta Cana,be prepared for one of the best Beaches you will have the privilege to use.Food at the Hotel was only OK,but what made the holiday for me was the service-always excellent,and always with a smile.I think the staff are the Hotels biggest asset and I cannot find enough good words to say about them.I must take issue with recent reviewers who were staying at the same time(May 1st-May 15th)-where were all the flies? I ate lunch at the Beach Restaurant most days and hardly saw a fly,never saw any at all in the enclosed Restaurants,and certainly none in the room.Met Majestic Richard and he is without doubt one of natures Gentlemen-Best wishes to you Richard.All in all a very good holidat and I will gladly take the place of anyone wishing not to go

<Content>New Caribbean??? Maybe..... The facility was very nice. Our room was spacious and decorated nicely, but the air conditioner was horrible. After one night we had to be moved to a different room. The grounds were beautiful, and oh my god the pool was every bit of fantastic. The beach was well kept and lovely around sunset. Our first night, due to the AC thing, we actually slept on the beach! The people were nice, and remember, they dont get paid squat, so tip as often as possible. The mixed drinks were mediocre at best, and the beer was so-so. The food at dinner was not as good as advertised, except the Japanese Steakhouse. It was a light in the dark for us! The lunches and breakfast were adequate, but nothing to brag about. All in all, I would say it was well worth the money. And it truly is becoming a new caribbean, just needs some work. Oh, and folks considering traveling with children, there were a lot of breasteses on the beach, so be careful! I enjoyed it myself, though!

<Content>You'll Love It Here....Don't Worry Do yourselves a favor, ignore the negative reviews and truly believe the positive reviews. We stayed, like many others apparently, from 5/9 to 5/16. It was an absolutely perfect vacation. The resort is gorgeous, beach is spectacular and weather was perfect...not one drop of rain. Early check in went well. Although the room was fine, we had hoped for a better view. We spoke with the front desk about changing and they asked if we could wait until Sunday and they would accomodate us. We glady agreed and as promised, we were moved by mid afternoon on Sunday. Pictures do not do this place justice nor do any of the negative reviews. Please, please, please consider that those providing such negative reviews must be this way all the time. It has to be more attitude than the resort, because this resort is tops. Are there small things to complain about...I guess if you're inclined to. But nothing, absolutely nothing, that would impair the normal person looking to have an incredible vacation, from doing so. As several others said....remember, you are not in the US therefore you cannot expect everything to be the same. And if you do....why are you traveling outside the US? Learn the Spanish greetings and you will be greeted endlessly with smiles and courtesy. Show you're appreciative of all their hard work. They work 15 days on, stay in provided housing off site and then get 3 days off. Come on guys. What do you want? DON'T WORRY...BE HAPPY AND ENJOY! Because there's no reason not to.

<Author>fletchman
<Content>First time in the Dominican, First time at an AI My wife and I, along with another couple, recently visited the Majestic Colonial on a four-night vacation. None of us had ever been to an All-Inclusive (AI) resort before and were unsure of what to expect as far as food, service, and amenities go. It is also important to note that this is our first trip to the Dominican Republic as well. We all read a lot about the Majestic prior to making our vacation arrangements and now we collectively feel that we should pass along our thoughts on the resort. We have put together a detailed review but for those of you looking for a quick take we can start by saying we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We give the Majestic Colonial 4 stars.The Good, The Bad, and The BeautifulAs a group we put together a list of requirements that a resort must have prior to making our reservations. At the top of the list we had good food with multiple A La Carte options, ocean front rooms, nice pool, nice beach with shaded areas to sit, plenty of bar options, and price. I say this because most people travel with the same goal in mind which is, of course, to have wonderful vacation. We had outlined what would lead to a relaxing, memorable, and fun experience in our opinion by coming up with the list I just mentioned. So the question is how did it stack up to our expectations? I will tackle food first because this is important to most travelers, although it is an extremely subjective topic. As a group we agreed that the breakfast buffet was very enjoyable with tons of options. Lunch was the weakest meal with a disappointing lunch buffet at the beach restaurant. We never did go to the main dining hall for lunch so we can not offer any opinion on that. It was disappointing that we were not able to take any food from the restaurant back to the beach, pool, or room. There were also not any other options for lunch besides the main dining area and the beach buffet. Dinner for the most part was very good. We ate at the Japanese Steakhouse, the French restaurant, the Steak restaurant (the beach restaurant), and the main dining room buffet. The order in which they are listed was the groups take on quality from great to OK. The Japanese Steakhouse was very very good. The French restaurant was a pleasant surprise for the four of us. The Steak restaurant was a little disappointing and the dinner buffet is very similar to cafeteria food or a Golden Coral type buffet. If you are interested in the Japanese Steakhouse try to make reservations several days before your arrival. We did not and as a result had to get lucky with a last-minute opening one night. Keep in mind your reservations will only be held for 10 minutes so make sure you are not late to dinner or your table will likely be gone. Overall the food was good and on two occasions it was great. Based on other reviews we had read the four of us were extremely careful about what we ate and drank. Perhaps if we had not worried about that our overall dining experience would have been that much better. They did warn us upon arrival though not to drink the tap water and to limit the amount of Pina Coladas and Coco Loco that we drank at one time because the dairy is not quite what we are use to and can be hard on your stomach. There are also a lot of Europeans that vacation in the D.R. and we noticed that if you are looking for a more lively dinner experience you should make your reservations later in the evening.As far as the rooms go we were pleased with the size and amenities. There was a bit of a mixup with the room type that we had reserved versus what was available upon arrival, but the hotel made everything right in time and put to rest any question we had about the customer service based on reviews we had read. The beds were not the most comfortable but I have slept on a lot worse in other hotels.The pool area was great. The resort does a fantastic job of having activities (aerobics, Spanish lessons, etc.) at the pool throughout the day. The pool bars are easily accessible and the bar tenders are riots. The only disappointing thing about the pool is that it closes at 6pm.The beach area at the Majestic is beautiful. We walked by several other resort beaches and I noticed that the Majestic had a lot more shaded areas to sit in than neighboring beaches did. The water is very nice in front of the resort although it is nowhere near as calm as other islands we have visited. It is important to keep in mind that this resort is on the Atlantic Ocean and as a result when it is windy the water can get a little choppy. There are waiters and waitresses that take drink orders on the beach but it is not a very speedy service. We found it much easier to just make the short walk to the beach bar to get whatever we needed to drink. We also noticed that some AI aficionados brought large thermoses with them that they would have filled at the bar with the drink of their choice. We will certainly keep this in mind next time. They have thermoses and sunscreen available at the Mini-mart but you will pay at least double what you can get it for at home. There is a bit of a game played every morning in 鈥渞eserving鈥?a good spot to sit for the day. Most people take towels and other beach items down first thing in the morning and place them on chairs to reserve a spot. After finding this a little annoying at first I came to the conclusion that it鈥檚 just the way it is. As someone in my group put it you might as well not waste time trying to fight the game since you won鈥檛 beat it. Instead, play it. In the end it all worked out. In conclusion we had a wonderful time. The pros outweighed the cons heavily. There is a lot to do during the day as far as on the resort or off the resort activities go. There is a lot of nightlife with all of the restaurants, bars, shows, and of course the discoteca. There are a lot of non-US visitors in the Dominican Republic and at this resort. This in turn means there are a lot of different cultures coming together in one place. At the resort we never had a problem with this and in fact embraced and enjoyed it. The airport is another story but that has nothing to do with the Majestic. The friendliness and hospitality of the staff was pleasantly surprising. The icing on the cake was that we had fantastic weather in the mid 80s every day. Keeping in mind that this is our only AI experience, we would recommend this resort to friends with some pointers (room type, dinner reservations, the beach game etc) to help them maximize their enjoyment. This vacation was about one-third the price we are used to paying for the other non all-inclusive trips we have taken. While the food may have not been as good as other non-AI properties in the Caribbean, for the price, the atmosphere and beauty was well worth it.

<Content>A+ for Majestic Colonial Overall, I was satisfied with my stay at Majestic Colonial (May 9-May15). The hotel is pretty big, clean rooms, and good service. There can be a slight language barrier with certain people, which is easily overcome with a little patience. For example we asked a waitress what type of milk she was serving us, I assume she didn't know how to say cow, so she just made a moo moo sound.Check-in went smoothly; we got our wet towel,  majestic drink upon getting off the taxi. Richard, the public relation assistant who I messaged on TripAdvisor prior to coming to Majestic Colonial, came out to greet us. He showed us around the hotel, and took us to make reservations for the two restaurants that needed it. I did notice there was a longer line at the Check-in desk on the weekends, but there were also more people helping with the check-in process.The beach was clean and beautiful. We didn't have a problem getting a beach chair with an umbrella. I can't think of anything negative or concerning about the beach. The pool is really big and long, there definitely no problems with overcrowding. The pool looks amazing, but there were a couple of times towards the end of the day where you would notice a huge amount of dead flies in the water. If you are heading from the pool to your room, be careful of the slippery tiles when you're on barefoot. I didn't find the water on the beach or pool to be too cold; it was warm which is perfect for me. The pool closes pretty early, around 6pm.Our room was in the second building, third floor. It has a partial view of the beach, and a great view of the pool. The room was clean, and is gear more towards couples because of the bathroom situation. It does have a musky smell if you don't have your AC turned on. You won't have a problem if you leave it on at automatic. There was one time early in the morning where there wasn't any water coming out of the faucets, but when I checked again later that evening there was water again. Not sure if it is a daily occurrence since I only have to wake up early just that one time. The bed was not hard, it was not extremely soft, it was in between.The food was okay, it was definitely not authentic. I tasted better, but it was not to the point that it was awful. The service in all the restaurants was good except for the steak house which I find the service to be slow. The drinks were inconsistent, didn't taste really good, and didn't taste like any that I tasted anywhere else. I did though enjoyed the drinks: 'My-Thai' and Blue lagoon, served on a table set up between building two and building three in front of the lobby during the evening hours. Didn't really have any stomach issue while we were there, but did catch something once we got off the plane. It is possible that it could be from the food on the plane, or our last meal at Majestic Colonial.I find Majestic Colonial to be lacking in the entertainment category. There are shows/performances by the same faces each night, which are nothing to wow about. Also, there was a daily movie at the sports bar. There are chess  checkers, tennis, foosball, ping-ping,  bicycles that are broken. There is a lack of interesting stuff to do, and you would probably get bored in a couple of days. But it was nice just relaxing by the pool if that is what you're looking for. There is a great shopping center located right outside of Majestic Colonial; it's walking distance, and remember to bargain like crazy.

<Content>Best vacation ever Our travel agent highly recommended the Majestic. A friend of mine recommended a different resort but we ended up going with the travel agents choice. The best decision ever. The hotel was immaculate. The staff friendly and always willing to give you the best service. The grounds picture perfect. The food was excellent as well. The seafood and steak restaurant went well above our expectations. The Japanese restaurant tasted just like the ones here. A beach BBQ on Sunday...fantastic, one of the BEST burgers I've had in a long time ( and I am a fan of Houston's in Northern NJ). Our only complaint was the dinner buffet...it was ok. We stayed for 5 days and wish we booked for at least 7. The hotel has such a tropical feel to it, so relaxing no pressure. Noone hassled you as in Mexico the minute you get off the plane timeshare stalkers galore. Not the case here at all. The nightly shows were fun. Water aerobics fun as well. Always plenty of bottled water and cold. I highly recommend staying here and can't wait to return. Never saw a bug..no trash, fresh linens every day. We felt very safe. I wish we had stayed for the Wednesday night beach party...if anything like the BBQ it must be a lot of fun. The native people are so friendly and warm. Our second time to the island, first time in Punta Cana and will go again and again. The ocean truly turquoise and clean...no hecklers walking the beaches, security everywhere to prevent it which was great. Just a beautiful, relaxing resort .

<Content>Great property, still finding its legs in some areas I went to Punta Cana with 11 other people and we had a very nice time. The Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana is a lovely resort, but it needs some refinement in some areas. The property itself is amazing, beautiful and enormous. I never felt anything was overcrowded, not even the beach, which I loved. The pool is sparkling clean, although I did not use it myself as I was addicted to the beach. Some of our friends who went with us stayed by the pool the whole time and loved it. I had a view of the pool and beach from my room, and it never seemed overpoopulated. Also, there's a lot of daily activities by the pool to keep everyone amused. The lobby area is lovely, and there's a nice bar there. We played cards in the lobby a few times at the tables provided and we had good service there. There's also internet access at the hotel in a small library type room in the lobby. It's well air conditioned, and there's books and such there as well. It was $5.00 for 30 minutes of time on the computer, but you have to use it all at once. The beach was lovely and remained clean due to the men walking around with trash bags cleaning up after too many people who thought it was alright to leave their stinky cups in the sand instead of throwing them away in the trash cans provided at the edge of the walkway. We had the pleasure of meeting Denny who took excellent care of us. He brought us drinks quickly and made sure we had palapas available to us when we requested one for the following day. We tried to show up early enough that it wasn't a problem as it does get a little busy later in the day. We love you Denny!! Also, there was a cool Paella barbecue at the beach which was dynamite. The chefs worked through a brief rainstorm and managed to make killer Paella. There were also beach olympics and other activities if you wanted to join in. Just so you know, there's a lot of weddings at this resort. You may see up to three a day. It was kind of fun after a while to see brides marching down the beach. The food was mostly good, with a few exceptions. I will say the buffet was ALWAYS good. I found my new favorite appetizer (little bananas wrapped in bacon). We had breakfast there every morning, and I was never disappointed. We ate dinner there three times, and all three times we were extremely pleased. The service in the buffet was excellent as well. I did not get the name of one of the young ladies who sat us in the mornings, but she was awesome. Always a smile, always working hard. The lunch buffet at the Hispaniola (the giant palapa by the beach) wasn't bad, but it's all open and there were a lot of flies. I ate there only once because of this, but I loved the hamburgers and my friends loved the paninis. At night, the Hispaniola turns into two restaurants, Rodeo Grill and the seafood place. I cannot remember its name. Everyone raved about their steak at the Rodeo Grill, but I was disappointed with my meat skewer, it was overdone. The menus don't elaborate if there's sauce on anything either, so be sure to ask what's on the meat or fish you're ordering. The seafood place wasn't bad, though. We did run into a problem when one of our party didn't want seafood and we had arranged earlier in the day for her to be able to get a steak from the Rodeo Grill (which is in the same structure) so she wouldn't be left out, but the waiters gave us a bit of a problem until one of our party spoke to the manager. In the lobby area/main building is a few more restaurants. Taino's food was good, but the service was not. We waited forever for water that never came and twice I ordered soda that never came. I finally went to the bar myself, and our friend contacted the manager. It was fine after that. We also tried the Le Gourmet, which was very nice. The service was very good, and the food was tasty. I would say Matsuri was the best, however. We made reservations for the hibachi room, and I would totally do that again. The chef and his assistant were fabulous, and we had enormous portions of food. As far as evening entertainment, there were a few options. There is a nightly show, but only a couple were worth going to. I think I am spoiled because I live in a town that provides amazing entertainment. The people who work in the shows at the hotel are busting their butts to do a good job for everyone, but they need more refinement and direction. The show that was the most heavily attended involved audience participation (men vs women), and this may be a better direction for most of the nighlty shows to go, with one or two being for dancing or impersonators. Some of the dancers were amazing, I will say. They did also have movies every night in the sports bar, and I was really glad to see newer titles offered, like Hitman, Next and several others that are recent DVD releases. I know on cruise ships sometimes the titles are a little old, so this was a pleasant surprise. There was also dancing, which was good, but it was a very small venue. A few of my friends went to the casino and seemed to have only one complaint, that some of the dealers were not fully trained to handle the tables well, and there were a couple of misdeals that were not handled properly. The front of the property (in front of the lobby) offers sports courts, a big chess board, pool table, ping pong and a kids area. I really didn't see too much of this as I was busy sleeping at the beach, but I heard from friends that this area was nice. There's also an all night food place here, La B del M, and they had good french fries. One night there were salesmen on the property near the lobby to sell jewelry and such to the hotel guests. There was some nice stuff, but they are a bit agressive, grabbing your arms and pulling you to their booths, etc. Some people don't mind this, but I really don't like this kind of agressive sales tactic. The rooms were extremely spacious. I was in a standard Jr. suite, and it was lovely. It has a huge jacuzzi tub that was fun. I had a nice balcony, and a great view of the pool and beach. The maid for my area was awesome. She was there early every day and did turndown service every night. I was in the #2 building. My friends were on the other side of the property and occasionally had a complaint about the maids not coming by late afternoon to give new towels. I personally never had this issue. The guy who handled the free minibar was really nice too, and he figured out early on that I was only drinking the diet soda out of the bar, and he was sure to give me extra bottles of diet instead of the sugar sodas. There were plenty of channels on the TV, including CNN, BBC, TNT, Cartoon Network, Disney channel, a couple of sports channels, and some international options, Starz, and a few others. I was pleasantly surprised by this as I spent late evenings catching up on the news and watching a bit of a movie. Also, there is a small safe in the room, similar to those you find in many hotels. I liked this little detail. What's a tad odd is the door on the shower and toilet area. They're kind of opaque, so if you're rooming wih someone, this could be a bit of an issue. I loved the shower! I did have continual problems with my toilet the first few days, but when I did call about it, someone was at my room in about five minutes and had it fixed in less than 10. There are excursions offered in the lobby by whatever tour company you go with. I don't know if they provide service to those who book direct through the hotel. We dealt with Georges from HotelBeds/Cosco, and he was really helpful, particulary in giving us info when we first arrived. He also made sure we knew when the shuttle would arrive to take us back to the airport when we left. We had a nice excursion in which we swam with sharks and stingrays. A tip or two: Bring some type of bug spray like Off or Cutter, you'll need it. I was eaten up by bugs the first two days, but then I started using spray and had little trouble. Bring some type of anti-itch cream or spray so if you do get bit, you'll have some relief. Bring sunscreen. The sun is equatorial and brutal. I never burn, but I burned in about fifteen minutes and paid with a lobster red back. There's shade and plenty of palapas to hide under if needed. Bring some type of immodium or other similar medication. A few of our party were drinking the water from the tap or making coffee with water from the tap, and they paid. Wash your toothbrush in bottled water provided in the minibar. Your drinks are fine, however. I drank soda and water all week on ice from the various bars and restaurants and had no problems. Bring lots of one dollar bills. I'm glad I read a prevoius review that said this, and it helped. We all like to tip for good service, and having a lot of ones on hand helped us all put in our fair share at dinner and for Denny on the beach who deserved every penny of it. Don't remove your armband they give you when you check in. It's a 90$ replacement cost. Ugh. Everything is expensive on the property, but they take American money. If you're in a room that butts up to the beach, you may hear the music from any weddng receptions. My friend had a room that faced the beach, and there seemd to be a reception at least two nights in which the music kept her awake. Bring goggles or a mask so when you swim you can see the little fish that hang out right there. Overall it was a very nice trip. The property is wonderful, but a few areas need some polishing. The people were friendly, and they work very very hard every day. The beach is beautiful, the pool spotless, the food very good for the most part. Enjoy your stay if you're going here.

<Content>We had a great time! We went to Punta Cana from May 7-11 and I have only one complaint about our trip- it was too short!When we booked our trip to Punta Cana in January I started reading reviews and I started to get a little worried. Some reviews were really bad but others were great, so I had no idea what to expect. I decided to keep my expectations low so I wouldn鈥檛 be very disappointed. I was especially worried because I was the one who found the deal and told my friends. So because of me they all booked the trip with us. Imagine if we get there and the place stinks鈥?who are they going to blame?Anyway, we had a group of 8 people, 4 couples. When we got to the Majestic we were very impressed by the resort. The lobby is gorgeous, check in took less than 10 minutes and we were greeted by cold towels and Majestic drinks (very good especially when you are really hot!). The grounds are very clean and beautiful, the pool is amazing and the staff is very friendly.The beach is so pretty and there are plenty of palapas and chairs for everybody. The waiters at the beach are so friendly, especially our friend NELSON 鈥淢ANDELA鈥? We miss you Nelson! Thank you so much for the coconuts! We鈥檒l never forget you! He was always very helpful, checking on us every 15 minutes! Great job!The rooms were very pretty, clean and spacious but we spent most of the time on the beach/pool area. We didn鈥檛 see any bugs, not even late at night when we were playing pool at the game area.We found the perfect spot on the pool area by the wedding gazebo. Next to the bar in front of the bubbles! Quiet and convenient!The area next to the wet bar is great for people who want to be involved in the activities with the animation group. We just wanted to relax and read.The restaurants are great and the food IS FINE! Believe me; I was so scared of getting sick because of all the bad reviews I read鈥?Don鈥檛 worry. We didn鈥檛 get sick we liked all the restaurants, specially the steakhouse. In my opinion the best meal of the day was breakfast. The breakfast buffet at the Supreme Restaurant is awesome. You have so many options that it鈥檚 impossible not to be happy. Try the churros and the crepes! I miss having fresh fruit juice every morning! The drinks are good as well. Not strong but that鈥檚 probably a good thing when you are drinking all day long! Try the Passion fruit with rum! So good!I never posted any reviews before but I felt the need to write one for the Majestic. Please don鈥檛 be scared by the bad reviews. Some people just like to complain and find problems with everything. Have fun, have an open mind and don鈥檛 expect things to be perfect all the time. Smile and say 鈥渉ola鈥? 鈥済racias鈥? A few Spanish words go a long way. And tips are appreciated. The staff works VERY hard all day long. If you have a good attitude I鈥檓 sure you are going to have a great time just like we did. We can鈥檛 wait to come back.

<Content>Great relaxing 4 days at the Majestic! Just returned from a 4 day break with my son.I have been to Punta Cana 4 times now and this hotel was by far the best. The property is beautiful, lush grounds, beautifully clean rooms. The staff is genuinely friendly without being pushy.I found there was a great balance between the activities, music etc...and being able to get away from the party scene and be able to relax quietly on the beach or at the pool if I wanted.The hotel is slightly away from the other big resorts on Punta Cana beach which meant that it felt a little more secluded and private....I walked down the beach past the Riu Palace and others and the crowds on the beach seemed overhwelming compared to where I was staying...Food at breakfast and at the 2 grill restaurants was great, we could not eat at the french gourmet given my son was 11 and they only accepted kids 12 and over. The mexican restaurant was OK...The shows at night were a lot of fun, plush seating and great waitress service. Upon arrival we had booked with CheapCarribean.com and were given an upgrade to a suite which was fantastic...The entertainment team was fantastic, again, genuinely friendly without being overly in your face....A special thank you for all the fun we had exercising, dancing and laughing to Rey, Walter, Tony, Ibelice, Maciel and Jesu!I would definitely come here again!Ciao, Yara and Nicky!

<Content>The Majestic Colonial - Worth every penny! We spent 5 days at the Majestic Colonial in the Dominican Republic. And, what a wonderful 5 days it was!First and foremost, I need to preface the review simply by stating the obvious, which most travelers from the U.S. seem to forget. When you travel outside of the United States, you have traveled OUTSIDE of the United States. Things are going to be different than what you might be accustomed to. This is NOT a bad thing! Open your mind a little... you just might enjoy yourself!I could spend the entire review just talking about how beautiful the resort and the accomodations are. But, like many others before me, what really made this trip was the staff. Even late at night, you could find staff members cleaning around the resort. The wait staff at the various restaurants and bars were very friendly.Our staffer highlight though, was Nelson. Whenever we were down by the beach, Nelson was there to take care of us. He went above and beyond anything I could have imagined, coming around literally every 5 minutes to see if we needed anything! One of our friends on the trip with us asked Nelson, Where can we get fresh coconuts? They didn't have these at the resort, but Nelson wouldn't hear of us going out on our own in search... so he had a family member get us 4 coconuts (we had a group of 4 couples on the trip). He had them ready for us on our final full day at the resort!Nelson - you are awesome! The trip would have been great all on its own, but you made staying at the Majestic Colonial awesome! We WILL see you again!Other HighlightsWe typically spent our mornings at the beach, and our afternoons at the pool. Both settings are very inviting! The animation team at the Majestic are really fun. How on earth they are able to maintain the level of energy that they do is beyond me!I was actually pretty impressed by the food, to be honest! I wasn't expecting much only because it was an all-inclusive resort, but in the end I was very pleased with the meals. The buffet breakfast in the mornings really set up the day nicely. The steakhouse at night near the beach had excellent meats. All in all, it was a very good experience.As far as not feeling well during the trip, this wasn't an issue. Just make sure to stick to bottled water and bring along some Pepto (just in case). A little planning goes a long way!My one and only complaint - the ATM machine in the lobby wasn't working, so mid-way through the trip we didn't have money left. We ended up stopping at another resort and using THEIR ATM to be able to get some cash for tipping (remember, the staff don't make a ton of money, so tips are nice).To have an ATM machine be the only complaint (and in reality, that is the fault of the bank responsible for that ATM, not the resort), I'd say the trip was beyond a success. I look forward to visitng them again one day.I would highly recommend this resort to anyone looking to have a good time!

<Content>Relaxing in the DR Very nice resort that provided what I wanted/expected. Rooms were cleaner and bigger than I thought they would be, food was good, not great. Drinks were weak to start. Ask for gasolina when ordering. There was plenty to do. If you wanted to get involved in the events, you could. If you just wanted to quietly relax, there are plenty of areas to do that as well. I would like to specifically mention one of the employees. Nelson de leon Coronado (Mandela) Nelson went above and beyond to accomodate our group during our visit. He was welcoming, attentive (despite his many responsibilities), and made our visit more enjoyable. If we return to Majestic Colonial it will be in no small part due to the positive experience we had because of Nelson's efforts. Thanks, Nelson!!

<Content>Majestic not digestable Hola! We booked our trip through Continental Airlines. We selected a Colonial Junior suite w/full ocean view and outdoor jacuzzi. Before, during, and after we booked with Majestic, we read reviews almost everyday. Mostly favorable except about the food.From the start, its a 30 minute ride from the airport. Check in was easy. Waiting for us was a cold towel and drink and the desk clerk was friendly. I took other reviewers advice about tipping. A buck here and there pay-off at times. We got to the Majestic early and to our surprise our room was ready before the check-in time. The desk clerk said we had one of the best rooms. He escorted us to the bellboy and I tipped the desk clerk a 20. The Staff was mostly pleasant. They love saying hola!. We had to get to our room by van. Even the bellhop was impressed by the room size. We had a bottle of champagne greeting us. Later a plate of fruit arrived and then free Majestic Polo shirts and hats. Thats tip #1.The room was big on the ground floor. We had a full view of the water sport activity house and part ocean. A little disappointed but I was just glad to be at this end of the resort. The room itself was clean but it was weird the toilet is not really private and its tiny. The patio had the Jacuzzi which looked scummy so we didn't use it. So don't pay extra for it. The rooms tub is a jacuzzi tub anyway. The room and other parts of the resort had the same musty oder to it.The beach is gorgious! powder white sand and clean. Great views of the sunrise/sunsets. The pool on our first three days was dirty. It was difficult to swim in it filled with dead flies. Dozens of 'em. The rest of the week it was spotless. Plenty of beach chairs and pool chairs to go around.Food! Buffet is average. Nothing special about it. The Mexican place was good. The French place, blah. Steak house good. Japanese, didn't try it. The wife got terribly sick after the french food. I got sick from the buffet. We never have gotten sick before from our travels in the caribbean until now. We're not drinkers so it wasn't alcohol related. The food is awful for what the resort claims its stardards are. It lacked quaity. Hopefully you won't encounter waterbugs at 2am when you gotta use the toilet like I did. Keep a towel on the floor of the room entry door. Other guests did the same.Casino is small. If you play slots forget it. The machines are few and lousey. The gym is small and half the machines didn't work including the tredmills (both) and three out of the seven weight machines were broke.The spa was average. For all that was bad about the Majestic, you can't beat the sun and sand. We didn't let it get us down. Checking out was as smooth as check in was. The van picked us up on time like we requested and the transportation was on time as well to the airport.Good luck if you choose this resort. But I'd think twice before coming here again.

<Content>Our Wedding Vacation - Great Stay Our Majestic stay was wonderful (April 22-29). My husband and I and our wedding party (27 guests) had a great time. I would recommend this resort for a relaxing vacation and/or wedding.Hotel Grounds* Check in was painless. We got a cold towel and a Majestic drink upon arrival.* The grounds are beautiful, very well kept. You will always see someone in the gardens picking up leaves and taking care of the flowers/plants. * Rooms: very clean. The minibar was always re-stocked and rooms were cleaned early in the day. The hot tub in the room was awesome. We filled it up one night and put shower gel in it and made our own bubbles! The room was nicely decorated upon arrival and we got a bottle of champagne in the room! There are 4 buildings; we stayed in the 2nd building, first floor (Majestic Colonial Jr Suite, facing the pool). Our room# 2124. Great location for us; we were near the SPA towards the middle of the resort. We had guests stay in the 3rd building as well and heard no complaints. I would not recommend building4 for now since there is construction going on next to it. Construction should finish in Nov鈥?8. The rooms are numbered 0 thru 50 starting at the lobby. As you get closer to the beach, the larger the number will be. I would try to stay away from rooms that are close to the beach if you鈥檙e looking for quite days/nights. Most of the activities are near the wet bar (rooms35 and on). * The pool is so relaxing. We swam from one end to the other. We brought a floater with us, but couldn鈥檛 find a way to inflate it, so we ended up not using it, and still had a great time.Service* Everyone was really nice. Make sure you bring some change for tips. Some of them really go out of their way to help you. Excellent service.* The check-in lobby is full with people so make sure you allow extra time to check out the day you leave. Also, make sure you bring your alarm clock if you want to wake up. Out of 4 times my mom called, she only got 1 wake up call. Also, phones in the rooms don鈥檛 have answering machines. If someone calls to leave a message, you will have to call the front desk. Not reliable, I didn鈥檛 get any of my messages.Food* Contrary to many reviews, we thought the food was really good at all restaurants. The only one we didn鈥檛 try was the Caribbean/Dominican one since we heard from guests it wasn鈥檛 as good as the other ones. Definitely go to the steakhouse and seafood restaurants to get both the lobster and the chateaubriand. The buffet has great variety. Leave room for dessert; they are really good, specially the cakes. Keep in mind you need reservation at the Gourmet and Japanese restaurants; they book rather quickly so make sure you make reservations the first day you鈥檙e there. As for the dress attire, just don鈥檛 go in a bathing suit! Shorts and dress/Hawaiian shirts are ok for men.* Don鈥檛 drink the tap water! My father in law accidentally drank some and got sick for a day. They use bottled water at the restaurants. Ice is safe. Entertainment* The lobby bar (first or second floors) were the best in my opinion. Make sure you try the mamajuana, local drink. Some of the drinks at the beach were very sweet, but overall really good quality for an all-inclusive. * The gym had a muski smell to it. * Entertainment: the disco had a pool table, bar, and dance floor. Variety of music, meringue, bachata, salsa, and regueton. Did not go to the casino. Saw the Michael Jackson show; it was entertaining.The Wedding!Larissa was our wedding coordinator. She is great! She did a good job and set everything up exactly how we wanted it. We met with her for about 20 mins and went over all the wedding details. We decided on the bouquet, gave her our cake topper, placecards and seating charts, and music for ceremony. Everything was done perfectly. She always made it a point to stop by our rehearsal, reception dinners to make sure everything was going well.We had our rehearsal dinner at the buffet. We had 27 guests. The table was decorated with flowers and candles. Very nice. The service and food was good. Benito was the server. We brought tote bags (one per room) and handed some of them there 鈥?we gave the rest out at the plaza bar the night before. The Plaza bar closes at midnight. The lobby bar is really close to it so if you want to keep the party going, you can go there until it closes at around 1am.I had my hair, make-up and nails done at the SPA. The prices are a little steep in my opinion, but they really do a great job. My hair turned out beautiful; just bring them a picture of what you want. In case you forget it at home, don鈥檛 worry! 鈥hey have a pretty good selection of pictures with hairstyles. Larissa can help you set up the appointment before you leave. The wedding was at 3pm; I started getting ready at 11am. I don鈥檛 think you need that much time, but I didn鈥檛 want to me rushed 飦?br/>It started raining (or should I say pouring!) about 30 mins before the ceremony. We had originally planned our wedding at the gazebo. The location was changed to an indoor room, conference/salon type. The alternative was the lobby, but there鈥檚 no privacy there. Larissa kept me well informed of the updates. She picked me up and we headed over to the ceremony. The nicest part of the room were the tall, french doors (looked great in pictures!). The rest of the room was decorated as promised (not a big fan of the carpet), but everything turned out beautiful! Aurelio did the ceremony. Don鈥檛 worry if you have to do the ceremony inside; not ideal (because I LOVED the gazebo), but it actually worked out for us because my husband was worried about sweating in the heat!!After the ceremony, the sun came out and we went to take pictures with Kenny. He had some good ideas for poses and took some around the lobby, piano, hotel grounds, and beach. He was open to suggestions as far as where/how we wanted to get the pics taken. He had a Nikon, 12MP camera. We had originally booked Kiko for our pictures since we read good things about him from past brides. Well, he was busy that day, but got a chance to meet him when we asked to change the bronze package to get more pictures on the CD. He鈥檚 Kenny鈥檚 manager. Unfortunately, he didn鈥檛 turn out to be such a nice guy after all. He was rude and insulting in the negotiation.While we were taking pics with the photographer, our guests were at the lobby-2nd floor. We took more pictures and migled until dinner. We had champagne being served. Reception was at 630pm at Tres Carabelas Restaurant. It was beautiful! Very nicely decorated; placecards set, just perfect. Larissa did a very good job. The waiter was Tomas. We had the lobster and steak and it was delicious. For dessert, we had local fruit (it was really fresh). We did our wedding cake at the wet bar. We rented it out for 2 hours after dinner and had our first dance and party. The night was beautiful! I would recommend weddings at the Majestic. Larissa was very organized and really makes sure you get what you鈥檝e hoped for your wedding! For questions my email is tropicalwedding2008@fibersphere.net

<Content>Best Vacation at the Majestic Colonial Our family and friends stayed at the Majestic April 20th-April27th and had the best vacation ever. We loved this hotel. The ground were very clean and the pool was great. We stayed in building #2 and loved it there. We were really close to everything. The people who work at this hotel were all superior! Richard is excellent and Victor and Sophia were very helpful as well. The food was fine and the drinks were o'kay. We recieved great service from Robinson at the steak house and could not have had such a great vacation without Denny. He was the best!! He served us when we were at the beach. Denny definitely goes above and beyond to help you. Really all the people do they are all so nice. This was by far the best customer service I have ever recieved without upgrading. Our rooms were nice and the hotel did well to keep us all in the same area. Much appreciated!! The beach is great and we loved watching all the weddings. It was nice to be at a resort where everyone you met was happy! This is one resort I would definetely go back again! Thanks again Richard!!

<Content>Beautiful Majestic We just returned from the Majestic Punta Cana and had yet another wonderful week of the beautiful weather and beaches of Punta Cana!To start this review off - we want to first acknowledge and thank a couple of special people at the Majestic who made us feel welcome and made our stay special.Rosa - who took care of our room (2127) She was so friendly from the first hour of arrival and made sure all of our needs in our room were met. The room was always clean and sparkling! I always felt secure leaving our room in Rosas hands! Always make sure you take good care of the staff taking care of your room!Denny - who took fantastic care of us at the beach - the best beach concierge we have ever had at any resort. He made the time to get to know us and what we liked to drink at the various times of the day - water and Majestics in the morning - gin and tonics or vodka/cokes in the afternoon - we did not even have to ask - he just knew! He was always there to take care us! (sit to the right of the animation area - where Denny is - it is quieter and more relaxing - and you get wonderful service from Denny.Rey - part of the Animation Team - he was very personable and so polite - right away he became part of the family and always brought much laughter to our day! He kept us informed on what was what and what to do! (with no pressure). Not to mention his high energy and great dancing - go Rey!Overall review of the Majestic:The grounds are beautiful, the pool spectacular and the rooms spacious, clean and comfortable.A very upscale and classy resort. The rooms are spacious and well decorated. We had a bottle of whiskey and rum in our room as well as some champagne. Also 鈥?robes and slippers were in our closet. The shower and toilet are enclosed in glass doors 鈥?so there is nothing you can hide 鈥?make sure you are comfortable with that or set up a schedule for some privacy. We had a jacuzi tub both in and out side 鈥?which we did not use.(I can only compare this to the Iberostar Bavaro where we stayed several times before in PC. We are big on service and at the Iberostar - they made it their mission to get to know us and made us feel welcome - we did not really feel that here from a majority of the service here at the Majestic). The beach was great 鈥?a lot of chairs and tiki huts and kept clean. They did a beach BBQ for lunch one day which was nice. (they advertised a beach party one nite that did not happen as I think there were too many weddings taking place that evening) They weddings looked very nicely done.RestaurantsThe main buffet off the lobby:Great variety of food - but not all the food was labeled which should be done - there were some unidentifiable foods within the stations that I would have tried had we know what they really were - that is what makes it fun - not mystery meats. Some of the prepared food (especially breakfast was cold- ask for your eggs to be made fresh.) Service was mediocre... especially breakfast. Folks did not take the time to be welcoming or get to know you - better service makes you overlook some of the food flaws - but we never felt that from this staff -too bad - we tip nicely! Bring your own coffee if you do not like your coffee strong (even with lots of milk). (I did catch some staff laughing at me after I had asked for 鈥渃af茅 americano鈥?鈥?we were offered that at the last resort -a watered down version most likely of the Santa Domingo rocket fuel).The food was great in the Japanese restaurant - Matsui. The habachi grill was fantastic along with our chef and waiter (which was the first time we experienced fun, interactive and personable wait staff at the resort). You need reservations for this - but the outer portion of the restaurant was walk-in with Chinese on the menu and sushi from an a la carte station. We did have that similar cold feeling from that staff on the outer restaurant 鈥?I needed help with how we should order and they were not very helpful.The Fish Grill was also excellent - no reservations needed there. We had lobster which was good 鈥?others at our table had a variety of the offerings 鈥?also good. The staff there also seemed happier and friendlier.The Beach Bar and Buffet (which starts at 10 am) was also great. We found that we enjoyed our breakfast there at 10 am instead of the main buffet. They serve lunch here as well with a good variety. Gourmet was ok - nothing special - need reservations. Steak House was also good - nothing out of the ordinary 鈥?good variety of steaks. The staff was friendly here.We did not make it to the Caribbean restaurant. Looked very nice.Lots of bars - we rate the Beach Bar the best with service, followed by the upper pool bar and the upstairs lobby bar. The others were obviously still good - but slow on service - they need more staff here - with smiles!! Minibar service in the room is stingy - and did not always deliver - but beverages were aplenty at all the other bars (it is some times nice to have a cold Presidente from a bottle enjoyed in your room)We had a swim up room - first floor which was fantastic - and we were glad that it was a bit away from the swim up bar - as the swim up bar was always hopping and some times too loud (music and activities start around 4pm) and we could not do this every day nor would we want to be across from it to get some late afternoon rest. We would most likely return to this hotel.However, the airport processes need to be improved - We love PC - but this is now our one big deterrent - the airport 鈥?it has gone down hill in that last 2 trips to PC. We expect some delays - but this was way too unorganized - but we did make our flight.We flew Delta this trip instead of a charter - Delta was very nice - they are improving. But a nonstop charter is the only way to go for us.

<Content>We had a Majestic Time! My husband and I stayed at the Majestic from May 9th through the 16th. We were very happy with out stay and will be returning again. This was our 5th trip to the DR in the past 3 yrs and 1st stay at the Majestic. We look at the other reviews and wonder if we stayed at the same hotel? That's how different we found it to be here. Its amazing how a 3 hour flight can take you to paradise and the Majestic is just that!!!!Arrival: Perfect and early. The first ho la and smile at the front desk stated our room would be ready in 30 minutes to please go and enjoy some lunch and return. We had a great lunch at the supreme buffet and took a little tour of the resort. First impression: Awesome. We knew this would be a great stay. About 45 mins later we returned to the front desk and our room was ready. Our baggage was immediately taken to our room.Room: Block 3 2nd floor overlooking the pool and had a partial ocean view. It was PERFECT. The room is large, clean, and not a single bug to be found. Upon arrival we had a happy anniversary banner on the door and bubbly waiting for us. The room was cleaned daily very well and our drinks always stocked. None of our items were ever touched and nothing went missing. What more can you ask for? Pool: We loved it. Always chairs and huts to be found no matter what time of day. I've never seen a hotel with so many available pool chairs for their guests. We can not say one bad thing about it and it was the highlight of our vacation. We love long windy pools and the one at the Majestic is so big it never felt crowded and many days it felt as if we had the pool to ourselves!Beach: Beautiful. Powdery Sand and pretty clean. We are not big beach type people, but we loved it. Ocean is just beautiful and the Majestic property you could just walk in either direction andit was so nice. Very safe.Food: We had absolutely no problems with the food. We ate at every single place except Le Gourmet. We had a reservation for our anniversary night, but unfortunately I was sick and missed it,so we will check that out on our return. My favorite was the steakhouse. I thought the Chautebriand was excellent and my husband loved the skewers. My husbands favorite was Tiano, the Dominican fare. Both of us really enjoyed the Japanese restaurant and it would have been even better if we didn't have to share the table with 2 couples that complained complained complained about stuff that means nothing. The water is too warm in the ocean and we paid a pretty penny and it should be cooler water ( yes hold on, dear mother nature, please change the ocean temp for these 2 whiny brats) The music is in Spanish all the time and I just cant stand it, I don't understand why we cant hear other music (seriously, really, are really serious???) Finally I gave them the don't go there and shut up stare and they piped down. If you are this kind of traveler, please don't go to the Majestic and waste the staffs or fellow travelers time. You are better off vacationing in your backyard - which I'm sure you will find something wrong there too!What we really loved about the Majestic is that we NEVER waited. We were always immediately seated and waited upon. We have never had that at an other resort. Many times we waited for 45 min's to be seated - so the Majestic is number one in our book for service hands down. We never had any problems finding food that we liked that was fresh and never had any temp issues. I think its been said again and again, you just have to be smart when traveling to aid in not getting ill. There is a lot of good advice from fellow TA members on the forums - follow those and your own common sense and it will aid in the whole food drama. Hey, if it doesn't look good, smell good, or taste good, don't eat it. Sanitation of other guests is what bothers us. I'm sorta of tired of the resorts getting the blame for food sicknesses all the time. Honestly, I am so disappointed in how people act at buffets. Just because the food is there does not mean you can take it with your own fingers - don't use your finger as a taster in a whole tray of food, etc. I don't know if its a cultural thing or not, but this was a trend I saw all the time and we don't care for your bacteria labeled hands in the food that is there for everyone. Oh, and it is that necessary that you need to immediately eat the item you just picked up while looking at other buffet items? You cant wait one minute to get back to your seat? Especially since you just came from the facilities and missed the whole soap and water portion of the ride? Exactly,,,and then we wonder why people get sick? Rant over.Entertainment: We had fun all week long. The shows were a great break and the animation team works really hard. They are out at the pool with you at 9:00 am and then dancing with you at the disco at 1:00 am. The next morning, there they are again, smiling and making sure YOU have a good time! Do the math, how smiley would you be on a few hours sleep after working a 16 hour day?SPA: We had a few spa treatments and everything was wonderful. Easy to book and always on time. Just one thing of caution, make sure you READ the receipt before signing. I saw guests with a few mix ups because they wanted the $55 massage, but they put down the 55 minute price instead, and it was $85 on the sheet, but they only got the 25 min massage. I'm sure that could make for hassle on check out. Just be sure to read before you sign.Staff: We had a great time and the staff at this resort could not work any harder. Always smiling and wondering what they could do for us. English was not an issue and I saw so many staff members speak multi - languages that I was amazed. The staff just worked so hard its easy to see why this resort is so beautiful. Thank you Richard, for answering all of our questions and helping us with room selection, it is so good to have a direct contact person with the hotel and Richard is A+.Everything was perfect, even with a sick day in there. We had a great time and don't fret, you will too! Thank you to the Majestic hotel and staff for making our week a great one! See you soon!!

<Content>Fantastic Resot Majestic Colonial Punta Cana:Overall: The resort is massive, the rooms are large and clean, the pool is amazing, the decor of the lobby, rooms and restaurants are very nice.I would recommend this resort to anyone.Things you should know:(If you are travelling with small kids)1. Milk -- we were never able to find traditional cows milk for our kids, it was either Soy or Rice. You can ask for their version of Nestles Quick to put in it to change the taste but if i had to do it again i would have brought powdered milk.2. Apple Juice: Can only be BOUGHT at the store for a ridiculous price. 3. Snacks: Great snacks for adults and teenagers however having small kids ( 3 and 6) they really didn't want anything being offered, i STRONGLY recommend bringing enough snacks to last you for the entire trip, we had brought some but not nearly enough for a whole week.4. General Comments on the Food --- you're in another country so remember that when you are eating, it's good but not what i would classify as excellent, well not at the buffets anyway. Mind you the other more formal restaurants foods were much tastier.5. Sun ---- sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen, make sure you bring enough you will be using it everyday no matter how well you tan.6. Tipping: Goes a LONG way on service if you tip. We left $2.00 U.S. every day for our maid. At meals we typically tip 1 or 2 dollars and it really seemed to matter.7. PHOTO'S -- I know it sounds cheezy to get your photo's taken at these places but i have to tell you, their photographers were AWESOME! Overall i would recommend this for a great vacation.What the hotel is lacking:1. There are lots of adult games that are taking place throughout the day in the main pool area but nothing really for kids.2. The castle swim area for kids which is far away from everything should just be removed, it didn't really appear to be anything great. We didn't even bother going in.3. Food for Kids -- In the buffet section they really need to dedicate one station to the kids, there were a lot of kids there. They also need to learn how to make more kid friendly meals, like a grilled cheese sandwich would have been nice for the kids.4. Beach -- full of seaweed not as blue as on the Carribean, this hotel is on the Atlantic Ocean. Overall Great Holiday, would go again and trust me i'm fussy.

<Content>No complaints, very good experience I feel I owe this to readers planning their trip since Trip Advisor was so helpful for us. We read some scary food reviews a few weeks prior and thought of switching and are very glad we did not. This is our 4th trip to DR and the best resort so far. We went May 11 thru 16, 2008Just to give you an idea our review is based on the fact that we are in our mid-40s going for a quick 5 nights w/out kids. We really just go to do nothing. We love the sun and only one of us drinks. The beach is one of our favorite and we have been to Jamaica, Mexico, St. John's, Hawaii, etc. and it once again didn't disappoint us. The usual arrival with the $10 per person entry pay for a piece of paper and give it back one minute later. A few stops at other resorts on the way to ours. The room was not ready at 1:30 but we were told to eat and come back. We chose to go book our dinner as suggested on TA. One lady at the desk was telling people the LeGourmet was booked for the whole week. We went over there and got in at 7:30 that night and again on Wed at 6:30 and reserved at Japanese for Tuesday at 8pm - 6:30 was already taken. we asked for 2 there on recommendations that it was real good but only got in once. LeGourmet the first night we both got the shrimp salad, pumpkin soup, chicken and two different desserts. The stuff with the chicken was a little heavy but overall very good meal. The second time we did the tenderloin that was highly recommended and it was better. I also did the other soup - lobster and that was very good. Japanese was a good meal also. We went to the steak house the other two nights and went with the Chaeteaubrind as recommended and that was very good. The second time I tried the meat on skewers and it was covered with bar-b-q sauce and I should have stuck with the tried and true but it was not bad. My husband had the grilled pork chop and that was good he said. Service is good although they don't ask if everything is okay once you get your food!! But it was. It was nice to have proprtioned meals and not buffet. Very nice to see the ocean at the steakhouse. We had no stomach troubles. we don't drink anything but the bottled water. As said, my husband said the wines were eh but they were very prompt to keep the glass full at all times. Same with saki at Japanese. Fried ice cream was good. No dessert on menu at steakhouse but a buffet type to pick from. Overall, we have had way worse at all inclusives and enjoyed going out each night compared to others always needing reservations and having hard time to get them.The room we e-mailed Richard prior but not sure that that helped. We were in Bldg 2 2322 and it was a pool view. The higher the number the closer to getting an ocean view looking to one side. I am a smell person and these rooms had no musty smell. I brought room freshener and febreeze for the bed but did not need any of it. This was a first compared to other places and very pleasing. We did tip one day to see if we'd get flowers but to no avail....only on our arrival. We used the bottle water to brush with always.You can get bottled water at any bar which was real nice compared to plastic cups at other places. Not being a drinker this was a plus for me.We never used the pool but it is like the reviews say. We don't need shade so at the beach we didn't need a hut but did see them reserved early with towels. We go to bake ourselves and never use them. Our tv remote didn't work; we took it before the Michael Jackson show and when we came back there was another one that worked - that was the only thing that we had go wrong!!! Don't know what others complain about. We don't go expecting the hotel to be in charge of our entertainment. We finally went to the MJackson show after all these visits, it was entertaining - had forgotten all of his songs!! But our typical day was breakffast, lay on the beach, clean up dinner and done.The walk to the shopping huts on the beach took about 2 hours round trip w/getting t-shirts. We did do our pictures by one of their photographers on the beach and they do a great job. but it's $10/picture or $10 each pic on a CD. Go thru the pictures and say yes or not to them and then they will negotiate. We had two printed and got a CD with the rest. It does work at home thankfully. We were able to walk in the other direction farther and saw some new resort going in.Overall, we had a wonderful stay and was very pleased with the resort. We would return there. I would recommend Bldgs 2 or 3, getting dinner reservations right away and having a positive attitude!! Oh yeah, the bathroom towels are like sand paper though - the beach towels were softer and after a day in the sun they were rough that would be our one complaint - not bad though. We saw a wedding each day and they seem to take great pride in their weddings. Hope this helps someone - any questions are welcome.

<Content>loved it I just got back from my vacation at this hotel. The hotel was beautiful and the atmosphere was excellent. I stayed on the hotel premises for the seven days I was there. The entertainment , poolside activities with the Animation Team, massaging spa, taking professional pictures on the beach and poolside. There was just so much to be done there. I never had to leave hotel only to go purchase souvineirs for my friends back at home. Most and formost I will like to thank a couple of your employees there. Jackilin Cedaro Capilona from the breakfast and lunch caferteria. She made sure my day started of well eating. George Fierriero from the Japanesse Resturant. He was very friendly and polite and finally Tony and Melvin from the Animation Team.

<Content>Left a wedding ring and got it back! We had a great stay at the Majestic Colonial. Here's a run down:STAFF - EXCELLENT!! Especially Richard Morillo! My husband left his wedding ring inside the safe after we cleared everything out. We realized it on our way to airport and called the hotel immediately. Francisco from the front desk remembered us and looked into our situation and called us back within half and hour while we were at the airport. I was on email with Richard there after on a daily basis trying to figure out the best way to get the ring sent back to us. Richard responded to me quickly, professionally, and frequently til the day I received the ring back. Kudos to Richard! Denny, the waiter on the beach was also wonderful! Marisol from the Buffet always greeted us and rushed to prepare tables for our group of 14. Hotel  Pool - Beautiful grounds and clean rooms. Long pool with lots of huts around. Quiet areas, noisy areas, musical areas, organized activity areas, bubbly areas, wet bar area, etc.BEACH - Plenty of huts available considering it was Spring Break week for us. Clean beach and calm water. Snorkeling was fun out by the bouys.FOOD - Most of the food was good. Steakhouse was the best, Gourmet was second, Buffet was always great backup plan. The lines at the buffet moved quickly, especially at the omelet station. Some foods could have been labeled though. We didn't like the Carribean or the Chinese restaurants.EXCURSIONS - We did the Zip Lines. FUN! Our kids were aged 9-14 years and we had adults too. Our 6 year old did not go but she could have. The staff was professional, safety minded, and strong. We also did an ATV and Dune Buggy day. There was a big confusion over how many ATVs and Dune Buggys our group needed. We had to wait two hours! It was very upsetting. When we finally did get going, we had a great time.SHOWS - We only saw two shows because they began so late, 10pm. Most of us were too tired by then. The Circus was the best, and the Michael Jackson show was okay.ROOMS-We had 3 adjacent suites. They were very clean, big, and comfortable. We contacted Richard on-line before hand and requested our 3 rooms to be next to each other.

<Content>Everything but Majestic Majestic Colonial is the worst hotel I've ever been in. We were 7 couples and at least 7 of got sick from the food. My sister was so bad we called the doctor on premisis and it took 3 hrs for the doctor to arrive, and this was only because she threatened to call national television and let them know about the situation. She had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance and she was hospitalized for 4 days with a bacteria from mishandled food, which my brother in law also submited to be tested and resulted positive from the same bacteria. There also was a rat in the pool and was taken out also when threatened. They did not evacuate the pool. They just got a plastic bag and threw it away. It seems to be if you do not scream you do not get anyhwere with them. Noone wants to be accountable for anything. I sent an email to my travel agent with all the details of this horrific stay and I also found out that another couple that were staying there as well got sick. They also sent an email with the complaint. I have yet to hear from the general manager of this property.

<Content>If you have already booked, lower your expections - if you havn't don't Stayed here in March. I could go on forever and bore you entirely but here are a few brief guidelines.Service: Don't expect any unless you are able to hand out huge tips - and even then it's not guaranteed.Food: Expect the worst and you will receive it. Salads are rehashed over and over. If you know the taste of old oil you will know where I am coming from. They have a hamburger chef for lunch who carries on cooking even though there are already 20 hamburgers ready. Rooms: Yes they do smell and you will get a room overlooking the construction site.Haughty staff: Lots of them especially in the Gourmet restaurant. Just one example, my husband went to apologise that we may be late for our booking 20.30 the hostess pulled a stop watch out pushed it under his nose and said it is now 20.32 and if you are not here by 20.40 your table will be cancelled. YOU HAVE 8 MINUTES Enough said but having made the 20.40 deadline we noticed there were at least 4 tables for two free for the entire evening so there was absolutely no need for this attitude.Pool: Nice pool but you do need to put your towels out. They closed the beach for two days during our stay and instead of bringing the beach stools to the pool they brought in two pool attendants who, (having seen the colour of your money ,at least 5 dollars per stool) would grudgingly assist!Casino: If you like to gamble then you'll go there anyway - but be prepared for the most hostile croupiers you have ever encountered. Order a drink on arrival - it may arrive within the length of your stay. Alternatively go to the bar which is SLIGHTLY quicker. Do not tip. You will receive neither thanks nor recognition.Summary:This was a last minute booking and I will not make the same mistake again. My thoughts were, the carribean is the carribean, but nothing could be further from the truth. We have travelled extensively in this area (Curacao,Aruba, Antigua, Barbados, St. Thomas, St. John's, Barbados) and have never encountered such hostility.If you are unfortunate enough to have already booked here are my suggestions:Book a table at the seafood restaurant and order the shrimp starter.Then order the Chataubriand from the steak restaurant (they will bring it to your table and you will not have to move). This is the best evening out we had in our stay.If you have a complaint go straight to the Managers Desk at Reception - talking to the waiting staff will only result in name calling!As I said in the heading if you havn't already booked - don'tand if you have lower your expectations!

<Content>Amazing time at the Majestic I will try to make this review as short as possible, however I do want to get every amazing detail about our trip included in this review. Me, my boyfriend and another couple traveled to the Majestic May 3 to May 10th. We booked through TNTVacations and I can only say amazing things about that website too. Everything you need to know is on the site and everything that needs to be done to book the trip is taken care of all at once.We arrived at the Majestic around 4pm on Saturday afternoon and were greated with the cold towel. We had a shuttle that was included from booking our trip to the resort. It only had 1 other stop so it wasn't as bad as from other reviews I read. Checking in was not a problem what-so-ever. I had e-mailed Richard in advanced and requested that us and the couple we traveled with were right next to each other and our request was granted. We stayed in room 3134 and it was absolutely amazing. We didn't do any excursions. We enjoyed how our days were set up though. We did the beach all morning until we wanted to do lunch around 1ish and then enjoyed the rest of the day in the pool (which the pool is aboslutely amazing and you will never want to get out). The excursions seemed interesting, however we didn't want to be commited to something for the whole day off the resort. I would also recommend getting up early a few days and go for walks on the beach. It's aboslutely beautiful in the morning and it's such a nice walk!I know a lot of the reviews before we left complained about the food so we were a little nervous. I can honestly say, being the picky eater that I am, I never had a problem finding something. We tried every place for dinner excecpt the seafood (us girls don't like seafood) and we enjoyed everything. I personally enjoyed Le Gourmet and the Steakhouse the best! Also, breakfast everyday was amazing!The last topic I wanted to touch upon was the serice. I want to thank Richard again for all of his help before we arrived. I also want to give a huge THANKS to Denny. Denny works on the beach and made sure we were given plenty of drinks everyday. He is an amazing asset to the resort. If anyone has any questions definitely let me know. I'm already looking forward to visiting the Majestic sometime in the future :)Diana

<Content>ONE OF THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!! We arrived at the Majestic Colonial on April 13 to 20th 2008 and just wanted to tell anyone who is booking this hotel that you will have the time of your life if you just relax and don`t listen to all the nay sayers who have been picking apart the resort. We traveled with another couple Troy  Cathy who we have been going to different resorts in the carribben for the last 13 years so we have something to compare it to.First off the best thing about the hotel is the staff , who never let a day go by without making sure you are having the best time posible weather it is getting you up off your butt to do the MANY activites or just serving you a nice cold drink on a hot sunny day.A big shout out to Maciel,Ivelisse,Tony,Ray and Francisco who made our trip one of the best we ever had.We felt like we made friends in the short time we were there with all of them.The resort tended to our every need including coming back to our room one evening and finding rose petels from the door to our bed,wine on ice and a bubble bath poured which was a very nice touch.The hotel itself is a great size , it seams like you are just 5 minutes from everything. But what really made our stay great was the food ,from the great breakfast in the morning to the A`la carts in the evening that you didn`t have to book aptm's for. It was awsome not being on someone elses time every night.We loved the food in all the restaunts but found the steak house to be the best ot of all of them.The beach is one of the best we have ever been to and the pool is just fantastic. So just go with an open mind and you to will have the time of your life. GREAT JOB MAJESTIC ( SEE YOU NEXT YEAR)!!!!!!!!!!Please keep this in mind when you go to the resorts,bring some nice gifts to give to not only the maids but also the gardners,the guys at the towel huts, also the buffet servers,we are so fortunate,so like Oprah say's pay it forward,they truly appericate everything we give them.Plus you make someone's day!!!This resort is a 5* all the way!!!!

<Content>Perfect Getaway We just returned last night from The Majestic Colonial Punta Cana, DR. I have been all over the world including the Carribean and found this vacation to be among my top 3 best ever. In preparation I had read many reviews and became frightened by some of them. Well, all of my negative expectations were proved wrong by this fabulous place. My husband and I were able to get away without kids for a change; we were in need of some serious alone time, were looking for total relaxation with no other agenda, no sightseeing or schedule of any sort and we did just that. The resort is very large however it seems as though they have really thought out the layout and paid attention to detail. The staff was very accommodating as we were never told no', that something could not be done. Weeks before arriving I had requested a quiet room close to the ocean and that is exactly what I got. Even with the noisy activities going on you could find a beautiful quiet spot somewhere.The entire resort is very clean. My fears of becoming ill ( and I usually get sick the minute I leave the zipcode) did not materialize as the food was very good, actually better than I expected and the drinks were not weak. I had a policy which I stuck to; no salad, no tap water, no ground beef, I did take ice in my drinks but still did not get sick. The grounds are beautiful, like the garden of eden and the beach, ahh you will not want to leave it. The rooms were very clean, and as for that mildewy odor you read about in other reviews, it is not that bad. It is a humid beach climate and you will smell it on your clothes and items more when you get home and is nothing a bit of washing won't fix. There is security all around the resort, some armed some not and they do not allow stray vendors to wander on and solicit you. There is constuction going on right next door for the new Majestic Elegance and you could see it from my room; I did freak out at first then realized it really isn't that bad, didn't really notice much noise. The pool was great too, very clean. For all of you uptight Americans, (I am one) realize this place is NOT americanized, don't be so picky; you will enjoy this place, it is beautiful, we did not want to leave. Funny because I once said I'd never go to the DR and now I can't wait to go back!! This is an adult vacation and really not for kids although there were some there. Personally I would not bring mine here they would be bored after 1.5 days. In closing, we were very impressed with the resort overall, the staff could not do enough for us and we plan to return in the future.

<Content>An awesome time at the Majestic! I only have great things to say about the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana! I stayed there for the second time between May 03 and May 10 2008. Just like the first time, everything was awesome!Beach: The Majestic is located on a pointe, the beach is larger there than in nearby resorts, the sand is white and very fine. Water was turquoise blue and warm and the beach was cleaned daily. Also plenty of pallapas for shade, and activities like beach party and paella party during our stay.Rooms: Great rooms, although looked a bit more used than during my previous stay in July 2006 when the resort had just opened. Not much privacy in rooms as toilet is stall-style (not a full door). Something to keep in mind if travelling with friends. Shower is marble and amazingly big, with telephone head. Note there are no face clothes, so better bring a few if you need them. Beds/pillows are decent. Unfortunately our room was overlooking the construction next door (new adult only Majestic resort to open in October 2008), but I personally do not care much as I only sleep in the room :)Pool: The pool is great, warm and as long as the resort. Of course there's a wet bar, lots of animation around 4-6pm. One drawback is pool closes at 6pm. There are also some jacuzzi type areas in the pool, with jets.Food/Drinks: The food selection is great, everything was delicious! Breakfast buffet is amazing, waffles, crepes, pancakes, eggs, omelets, pastries, fresh breads, smoothies, fresh fruits, a full hot buffet, etc. We had lunch at the beach restaurant everyday, where they have a good variety of food and you can enjoy your meal outside. For dinner there are plenty of options, everything is very tasty especially the French restaurant (gotta try the creme brulee with mamajuana infusion!!!). Seafood and japanese were also great (although the ambience at the tepanyaki isnt the best in my opinion as it is way too bright in there) , steak house was my least favorite but my friends liked it a lot. The drinks were great, especially for happy hour at the lobby bar! Staff - The dominicans are so friendly, always smiling and willing to help! Of course it helps if you try to speak Spanish and tip. I went there with two girlfriends and I cannot count how many times we were told we were beautiful... :) My favorites were Felix at the beach bar, Denny the beach concierge, and Orlando at the Japanese restaurant. The animation crew was also great, getting us moving on the beach in the morning (aerobics, stretching, dance lessons) and at the end of the afternoon at the pool (step, games, etc.) I have to congratulate Reginaldo, Melvin, and Jesus for their energy! Loved dancing with you guys :)Shows - The shows were well prepared and looked very professional, and some were really hilarious! A great way to digest your meal before hitting the disco bar!Discotheque: I made it to the night club every night but the first, and had a blast there! If you like to dance to latin rythms (even if you are not very good at it) go there after the show and dance with the animation crew, they are great. Music is good but could be a little more diversified; they also play a lot of club music you hear in the US. There is also a pool table, and a small casino next door. I am not a fan of casinos but I guess it is big enough to waste some money there if thats your thing :)Clientele: During our stay there were a lot of young people, we made a lot of new friends and got to speak tons of Spanish :) Not too many kids screaming around, which was good for relaxing.Overall: Love the Majestic, for that price you absolutely have to go!

<Content>Great Resort but beware of FOOD The resort was very nice. We had a problem with our room on check in and within 15 minutes we were moved to a much better room.The staff, service were great!! The place was clean and very well run.Now the food. I am a chef by trade and did not think we were going to get exceptional food. I know the challanges and cost it takes to run a operation like this, but the food was worst than I could have ever thought!Both my wife and I got food poisoning. I wanted to contact the hotel staff , but my wife did not want to make a big deal of it. Thank god we both ate very little and had a mild case so it did not total destroy our short trip.We later learned as we were leaving that we were not the only ones that got sick. I have been in the foodservice buisness for over 20 years and was shock at the food and beverage operation. This resort did sooooo many things right, the staff worked very hard, it was disappionting to have the food take away from all this.I can not stress how bad it was, when we got our return flight home, the airline serverd us some kind of chicken and instant mashed potatoes and my wife and I thought we were in heaven. Imagine airline food being the highlight of our culinary experience. It seems to me that if they could reduce what they offer and do it right they could be the best resort in the area.Bottom line- Great resort but plan on losing wieght and bring snacks!!

<Content>Majestic might be an overstatement This is a bit late but better than never. I know that there have been glowing reviews lately so I hate to be a downer but I wasn't that impressed. Grounds: I will agree without a doubt that the grounds of this resort are beautiful. The beach is great and I never had a problem finding chairs. No one will harass you unless you are bothered by the occasional topless women and children. The pools were great, again with ample chairs and no need to go out at the crack of dawn. Staff worked really hard to keep everyone entertained and were always very friendly and accommodating. If I could stay at the pool or beach and not have to eat or sleep then I would have no complaints. Room: The beds had to be the most uncomfortable that I have every slept on. The room stayed humid so it always felt like everything was damp. We could never get the temperature right so we stayed cold and wet if that even makes sense. I think it's been mentioned before but be sure to bring your own wash cloth because you won't be able to get any without a fight. Not sure what the problem is but it took us a few days to get anything other than a hand or bath towel.Food: I've been to countless all inclusive resorts and the food here had to be the worse. First it was totally ridiculous that for a few hours between lunch and dinner there was no where to eat. Each buffet served the exact same food day after day after day. The restaurants weren't much better and the service was often extremely slow.Overall I would say if you can eat anything and sleep anywhere then this resort will be just fine. For some the shortcomings with the food and room will be justified by the beauty of the grounds- unfortunately I wasn't one of those people. I also didn't like that you couldn't really go anywhere outside the property on your own. We did a few excursions that were fun but there weren't very many options. I was there for 7 nights and after the 3rd night I was feeling a little too confined.

<Content>Great Vacation My husband and I stayed May 3rd -10th. I was nervous about the whole food situation and negative reviews but I am happy to say our stay was great. When we checked in we were put in room 1134 on the ground floor that overlooked the resort next door. I told them that I wanted building 2 or 3 and they said they could move us the next day. We ended up in room 3320 in building 3 which was on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool. It was a great location. Building 2 also overlooks the pool but it is almost on top of the pool area as where 3 was set back so you didnt get all the hustle and bustle but still had a great view. They only negative was that the bathroom area had really little black bugs running around. I just didnt leave my stuff out around the sink area that I like to do so I had to keep going in and out of my suitcase. The bathroom stall was kinda small and like everyone has said not a lot of privacy. Fine for a married couple. The shower was huge and could hold about 4 people.They had left us a couple of bottles of wine in the room when we arrived off the beach on various days. They also left sushi and something else we arent sure what is was.The beach and pool were amazing. Beautiful sand and water. The pool was huge and ran all thru the resort . Even thought they were booked to capacity it never felt crowed. Always chairs and loungers. Do go out early though if you like to get a shaded hut. Those go fast. The weather was sunny and hot everday. We had 1 hour of rain our first day and that was it. If you walk down the beach to the right about 45 minutes there are outdoor shops that sell T shirts, paintings, and other stuff. We didnt realize it would be that far but the walk goes by fast. They also had vendors that came to the hotel one night and set up their tables. Mostly jewlery. I got a nice necklace for $9.The food: We were extra cautious about what we ate and we were fine. The Gormet restaurant was excellent as was the seafood (we had the shrimp, and red snapper) and steak place (we had the chatueabriond) . Never had to wait for a table and the service was pretty good. We never ate at the mexican because I dont like that type of food. The breakfast buffet had everything you could want. We ate at the main buffet for lunch because the outdoor one had flies and we liked getting into the aircondtioning off the beach. I ate mostly pasta and pizza. They had all kinds of dishes and I can see how people could easily get sick. Stick to what you know and what looks good and you should be fine. We also ate at the Japanese. It was just OK but a lot of food. You need to make reservations for the Gormet and Japanese as soon as you get to the hotel or you may not get one.Entertainment was good. Eveynight at 10:00 they had shows. The Michael Jackson show was good as was the acrobat show. They also had audience participation games that were really funny. We didnt go to the casino or disco. After a full day at the beach and nightime entertainment we were ready for bed at 11:00.We decided to splurge and go to the spa. We had what they call the Chocolate Dream. They wrap you in chocolate and then after thats done and you rinse off they give you a full body massage. It was great. Ask for Eileen. She was awsome at the massage. My husbad was in heaven.All in all it was a great relaxing vacation. Dont worry about the negative reviews like I did. All the worrying was not worth it. You'll have a great time.

<Content>A great family getaway Travelers: Six adults ( two seniors) and two children ( agers 6 and 3)This was our second trip to the DR but the first w/ the kids. The trip was booked through Costco travel and we chose this resort because of its all-inclusive package which allowed kids under 12 to stay for free. We flew on American and arived in Punta Cana around 1pm local time. The pkg also included roundtrip transfer, but the shuttle service made stops at three other resorts and so what should have been a 30 minute drive ended up being over an hour which was mildly annoying, but not awful. The entrance to the resort lobby is breathtaking. A very grand and expansive lobby area leading to a descending staircase to an elegant bar and lunge area that leads out to the grounds. The property is beautifully landscaped and despite its size looks and feel comfortably intimate.The staff is professional and welcoming from the moment you step into the lobby. Our check-in took longer than it should have as there was some wrangling over a complimentary upgrade that they could not accommodate at the time. We settled into three first floor garden view jr suites. All rooms have refrigerators that are stocked with drinks daily.The rooms are in thirds. The first third is the bathroom; all marble and tile. There is a large jacuzzi tub, a large shower and a narrow, too small toilet stall. I am not a huge guy, but was not really able to comfortably use the toilet when necessary because of the limited room in the stall. The second third is the bedroom areas which in our room was two full beds and the tv armoire. The other rooms w/out kids had nice four post king beds. The last third was the living room area and had a small couch, table, desk and chair. Beyond that was a nice size patio and small garden yard that faced the outer rim of the property. Again, the landscaping was magnificent and it was a pleasant view.The food at the Majestic was better than the food I experienced on my last DR trip. Great choices at breakfast, lunch and dinner. I would recommend the Supreme buffet for breakfast and the beach grill buffet for lunch. There are two restaraunts that require dinner reservations. We enjoyed the Japanese place and Taino which served traditional dominican fare. The Supreme also served good dinner and service everywhere for every meal was superior and attentive.The Majestic's pool extends from one end of the resort to the other. Plenty of chairs and both sunny and shady spots to lounge. They have daily entertainment by their animation team and people are generally having a relaxed, fun time throughout the day. The kiddie pool was centrally located and perfect for our girls to play in with minimal supervision. The pool does close at 6pm, so there is no night pool noise to contend with if your room is on the pool side. The beach is large and again full of chairs. There is a constant breeze coming in off the ocean and the water is true blue. They also have beach parties and evening programs and dances. We also saw about two weddings a day at the resort, so this appears to be a resort with a good track record for destination events.We did not do any excursions, but I sat thru the presentation for them and only one was over $100; most were between $30-$80 to do. My wife used the spa one day and her massage was $85 for an hour. There's a casino which is really like an oversized arcade, but okay enough for some casual hands of blackjack. They have a strip of shops and stores, a dance club and a theater. There is also a nightly happy hour with live music and the grounds have light fixtures built into the landscape to make it very pleasant to stroll around in the evening. Overall, this was a great vacation. We were a group of eight people ranging from age 3 to 78 and everyone had a fantastic time. We would return anytime.

<Content>Wonderful hotel! I stayed at the Majestic for 5 nights in April with my family and had a wonderful time. The hotel is as beautiful as everyone says it is, from the rooms to the grounds. Everything was so clean. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Most of them spoke some English so it wasn't too hard to communicate. We stayed in Building #2 on the second floor which I requested beforehand. Our view was of the pool which was beautiful and lit up at night. We spent our days relaxing at the pool or at the beach, basically alternating each day. There were plenty of chairs and umbrellas at both the pool and at the beach. I travel quite a bit and the beach there was one of the nicest I have ever seen and definitely the nicest I've seen in the Caribbean. The weather was great except for 1 day that rained briefly. We were never bored. At night, we usually watched a movie after dinner and then the nightly shows which were not too bad. The entertainment staff was very enthusiastic and energetic. I felt that the drinks were on the weak side so I started asking them for more alcohol and less mixers. I brought a bunch of thermoses to keep the drinks in during the day. These work REALLY well at keeping your drink cold and I would highly recommend bringing one. Plus, they will give you more quantity than the small glasses or cups that the hotel provides. The food was a mixed bag. For breakfast and lunch your only options are the 2 buffets, the main one near the lobby and the one near the beach. The food at each was pretty decent. The main one is bigger and has more options but if you're hanging out by the pool or beach during the day, you may not want to be bothered going there for lunch because you can't walk in with just your swimsuit on like the buffet by the beach. The buffet by the beach was smaller and had less options. Both buffets didn't change their items much from day to day so it's easy to get sick of eating there. At night there are 5 different restaurants and we tried all of them. The best one was the gourmet restaurant which you should make a reservation for as soon as you get there. I am Asian and I would have to say that the Asian restaurant was pretty horrible. The food was bad and the service was also not very good. They even forgot our desserts. We weren't able to get a reservation for the teppanyaki demonstration part so I don't know if that food was any better. The Dominican/Mexican restaurant was mixed. The entrees to order were mostly Mexican dishes and weren't that great. However, they had a small buffet of Dominican dishes which were very good. I would recommend just eating that. The food at the steak place was ok but the service was also not very good. They forgot our appetizers there. And the seafood restaurant was also not great. They burned our lobsters which I did not think was possible. In general, the service at all of the restaurants was pretty slow. They had plenty of staff to bus the tables but not enough people to take orders. I think this was due to the fact that they don't have enough staff who speak English well. Only my father became sick while we were there and he was the only one who did not use bottled water to brush his teeth. Bottled water is plenty available, both at bars and in your free mini-bar in the room so you should definitely use this for teeth brushing and drinking. We also took prophylaxis for malaria as the Punta Cana area is high-risk for malaria and antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended by the CDC. Overall, we had a really nice vacation here and I would recommend it to other people. When I booked it, I found that the cheapest way to go was to book directly through the hotel's website. Other sites, including CheapCaribbean.com, will add on their own fees.

<Content>Amazing I Just got back from the Majestic, I went down for a wedding with 3 other girls, we had an amazing time. The resort is beautiful, it doesn't matter where your room is located everything is within walking distance, they have resturants at both ends, so if your at tha beach or at the pool food is only seconds away. The animation team (Francisco) was really good, they did activities all day by the pool, they have games, dancing lessons... so you can either watch or participate. I would recommend watching the shows at night, they are different each night so theres something for everyone. I don't usually go back to the same resort twice, but for this one I would make an acception.

<Content>A hotel that we'll remember May 10th 2008We went between Feb.17th and March 2nd, 2008 for our 25th marriage anniversary.We had one of the nicest stay. The hotel is quite clean and impeccable. The hotel personnel is fantastic. Always smiling and making sure that your needs are always fulfilled . Our room (no.1245) was fine and cozy and not too far from the beach. It was cleaned everyday with their personal touch and the fridge filled every day. I must say the service was number one.The main buffet was allright but the steakhouse and the seafood restaurant were mmmmgood. We did try the chinese resto but it was awful. The Dominican resto was different and good. It was there we were initiated to Mamajuana, the dominican viagra, Ha Ha.The beach was nice and clean. We did not have any problems to find beach chairs every day.And now we want to thank a few members of the hotel staff starting with Fermin,a special friend we made down there and who was the beach concierge. He made a detour every day to wish us a nice day and take time to have a small conversation with us during the day. What a nice and interesting man. We met Denny the other beach concierge who seems to be a nice man but we did not have a chance to know him better. Next time.We must also thanks some people at the steakhouse and seafood restaurants, Francisco, Robinson and Carlos Omar(what a dancer) Benitez, the 2 resto supervisors, and special thanks to Domingo, Ramon Emilio, Alix and Eustacio for making our stay very pleasant.And last but not least the beautiful and smiling Janet at the front desk. If you have any problems at the hotel go see her. You can be sure she 'll do everything in her power to fix the problem. She is so nice and helpful.When we go back to Punta Cana, we surely will go back to that hotel.Denis and Louise from Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Canada

<Content>What a great time we had, can't wait to return. Well, after a week in rehab (Presidente withdrawals, sleep deprived, loss of arm strength from carrying Bubba girl about and overall depression from having to return home from paradise) I ready to write my review. First and foremost I would like to say a special thank you to Richard at the Majestic who worked so hard prior to our arrival and during our stay to make our vacation one of the best we have had in many years. This gentleman is a true asset to the Majestic and if he leaves prior to our rebooking at the Majestic next year I fear I may have to follow him to his next job. Do they have stalking laws in DR??LOL. I love you Richard.Flights to and from PC. We had a 6:50 am flight out of Logan. Got there the usual 2 hours early and breezed through ticket lines and was sitting waiting to board plane within 1/2 hour of arrival to Logan. TSA did check my carryon and wouldn't you know it was my Bubba Keg that caused the commotion. Explained to the TSA personnel the background on Bubba and variety of uses and was on our way. Went American Airlines with stop in Miami on the way there and home. On time or a few minutes early. Only issue I had was the flight attendant on flight down to DR told everyone that there was a $75.00 departure fee from DR. Alot of folks on the flight were shocked to hear this, myself included as all have been saying $20.00 each or nothing as it was included in the specific packages. Long story short in the end we did not pay any fee to leave the country. I'm assuming the cost ($20.00 which others had paid) was included somewhere in our package price. We did however, pay the $10.00 entrance fee into the DR. No biggie. In and out of airport was a breeze at PC. On board the VIP shuttle van within 1/2 hour. Got to PC airport at approx 1:15 pm. sat on the shuttle bus about 20 minutes and was at the hotel at 2:45 p.m. Had to stop 5 times prior to arrival at Majestic. At the Iberostars and Rui hotels. Wild ride between the twist and turns on the main roads and the speed bumps every 50 feet at the hotels I was glad to get to the Majestic. Next time I may opt for the taxi ride from PC airport to Majestic. With no stops you can get there in about a 1/2 hour. Shuttle on the way back to the airport was fine as Majestic was the last pickup prior to driving straight to the airport.Upon arrival to the Majestic was immediately greeted with a cold towel and taken to check in where we received a Majestic cocktail. Sweet but yummie. Before I could ask if Richard was available one of the gentleman went in the back room and then out came Richard who introduced himself and completed our checkin. He escorted us to our room and on the way took us to make reservations for dinners at the Gourmet and Japanese restraurants and explained to us the layout of the hotel. We arrived at our room -1420-Colonial Junior Suite. Room was one of the largest we have ever stayed in at an AI. Had the two sitting areas plus a writing desk and chair . Just as it was pictured in the photos from other folks. It was a corner unit with a balcony and terrace with jacuzzi. The balcony overlooked the hotel next door and did have a not so nice view of the back of what I am assuming a restraurant. But it also had some pretty good views of the ocean. The private terrace which was surrounded with about 3 foot walls overlooked the hotel next door again with ocean on one side and the garden area and building 2 on the opposite. My husband was quite happy with his jacuzzi as most of you may already know from my day by day review when we were there.LOL. The Colonial Junior Suite do allow for free room service. We ordered it on a couple of occasions. Once when we had Oceangirl and her hubby over for a quick bite prior to our Meet and Greet with other TA members and once for breakfast. I was stunned on both occasions with how much food they brought. It was truly more than anyone could eat. Service was quick within 1/2 hour (they tell you it will arrive within 40 minutes). Enjoyed the robes and slippers in the room. Wore the robe alot in the room as we were back in forth in the jacuzzi and the AC worked just dandy. Slippers were great as the floors are all tiled and can be slippery when wet. Balcony had a drying rack attached to the wall this was handy for drying bathing suits (I brought about 10 and I packed 5 for hubby- I used 8 and hubby used 3) Fridge was stocked with sodas, chocalate and of course Presidentes. We were also given a bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label whiskey and a bottle of Bruggal rum, two bottles of Champagne. Toilet is as described in previous reviews, shower huge and jacuzzi in the room. Never used the jacuzzi in the room always used the terrace jacuzzi. The terrace jacuzzi took about 2 1/2 hours to fill and about 15 minutes to empty. Had hot and cold water out of spicket, so you could warm it us at night which was nice. In the end I would get this category room again or upgrade to the Colonial Suite category as they are in building #2. Already picked the room 2411 or 2412. These two overlook the pool and again corner units.I have to say that one of the main reasons for choosing the Majestic was the pool. It is huge.....and very clean with no overpowering smell of glorine. We did not have any problems finding loungers with umbrella huts for the two of us. Any time we were swimming in the pool we truly felt that the area was ours. It is was not crowded and they were totally booked. There were alot of children there the week we were there but I have to say we did not have any issues with the little ones running about around the pool area (or anywhere for that matter)or being out of control. I must say that the beach was lovely but we did not partake in laying out on the beach. What can I say we are pool people. Oceangirl and hubby enjoyed it very much and you can read her review for more details. Though again I will say that there were plenty of loungers and umbrella huts for those who chose to dip their toes in the sand.At night the grounds are lit up beautifully and I personally thought the hotel was more beautiful at night than in the day. Don't get me wrong it very nice during the day, but it's just gives the place more of a romantic feel at night.Service was outstanding. Never waited more than a minute or two for a drink and I never had a problem with anyone filling up my Bubba (20 0z). I actually think that many of the bartenders got a kick out of my Bubba girl dressed in her daily bathing suits. Hubby initially wouldn't bring my dressed Bubba to the bar but after I told him to man up he was fine. LOL. Never had to wait long to be seated for any meals as well. Service was always quick and plates were always cleared in a timely manner. All the folks at the Majestic were friendly and always said hola and smiled. Our maid who cleaned the room was efficient and the room was always well cleaned and decorated with flower pedals and the like.Food-Can I say I liked everything that I ate. No, of course not. But I can say that I had plenty of choices and never, never went away hungry. Hubby said he enjoyed everything that he ate and let me tell you the boy can eat. (All 165lbs of him) Our favorite restaurant was the Japanese (food freshly prepared and a show)and my least favorite was the Gourmet (steak was very tough and very difficult to cut) We enjoyed eating at the steakhouse for lunch. Run in grabbed a quick bite and back out in the sunshine. Loved the chicken no matter how they prepared it and enjoyed the variety cold salads (pasta, rice, green) I brought a pharmacy with me and we never once took a Pepto or Immodium for any stomach issues. We are used to the food as this is our 3rd time to the DR. In my personal opinion the food is the same at all of the AIs in DR its just prepared in a different hotel kitchen. The overall recipes are the same and the food is most likely provided by the same suppliers, We brought our laptop with us and used it everyday. We paid $10.00 a day which I thought was quite fair as again we used it quite frequently (I wrote a daily TA review and hubby checked on things with work) TV and internet are satalite and we only had problems with both when it rained/downpoured. TV had quite a few US stations USA, ESPN, TBS, one major US station, a BBC station, kids cartoon station (which ironically never lost a signal to when it rained-those lucky kids) and there were a few more. Bugs-Hubby and I got one mosquito bite each and we never had to put anything on for the inch. Mine pretty much disappeared in about an hour. We did have one cockeroach in our room and it was found during the rain storm. I think that it came in from under the door from the outside. Unfortunately it was seeking shelter in my room on the bathroom counter when discovered. Hubby took care of it as I fled for the safety of the balcony in the pouring rain. Never saw another bug of any type in our room after that.Animation team- Always friendly and fun. Played a game or two and took a Spanish lesson. Animation team worked hard to involve the guests but were never pushy about it. Shops- Typical souvenirs for the tropics. Bought a few carved wooden animals for the grandson and hubby bought himself yet another carved tiki (Johnnie Big Wood as he likes to refer to them). They have a Harrisons Jewelry store on site. Not a huge selection and of course very pricey. Nice selection of Larimar (Stone specific to DR). They have a cigar shop on site. Cigarettes are $6.00 a pack or $35.00 for a cartoon (Marlboro and Marlboro lights)Can't tell you too much about any mixed drinks. Hubby and I are beer drinkers and pretty much stick to what we know. I did hear that it was hit or miss on the mixed drinks. Some bartenders made an awesome drink and then others didn't even know the proper recipe. Hubby and I meet a bunch of wonderful folks from TA. My true and best -Oceangirl, Friendship, Sooboy, Ibgoodno, Lova, Sunlover, Pooltoys and I hope to meet with them again. We had a wonderful time and look forward to returning and bringing friends next year.Some tips....Smile and say Hola to everyone you meet.Start a meet and greet for the hotel you're staying at. A great way to meet those other TA addicts you've been conversing with prior to your trip.Bring plenty of ones to tip the hard working folks that greet you everyday with a smile and great serviceBring plenty of suntan lotion - Sun can be brutal. I also wore my baseball cap everyday. Not only to keep the sun off my face but to hide the bad hair days. Water is very soft and couldn't do a thing with it. Bubba Kegs or your favorite thermal mug are muy importante. Frosty stays frosty and hot stays hot.Pop up laundry hamper. Great to use in room for the dirty clothes. Instead of opening and closing suitcases.Please be careful on the floors when wet. There is tile everywhere and it is slippery when wet. I also found the Gourmet restaurant and Chinese/Japanese floors to be very slippery in my heels. Wood and some other surface not tile in these rooms.A night light would be handy for those late night wanders to the bathroom as it is quite dark in the rooms when the curtins are closed.And finally the most valuable tip. Please do a test on your balcony/terrace doors. Have one member stand in the room and the other outside. Close the door tight and see if the person on the outside can open the slider. Why you may ask?? Well if you are both outside on your terrace in your jacuzzi in your birthday suits and discover that for whatever reason when you closed your slider it locked. You either better had learned to speak the phrase help I've locked myself out of the room and need help or be willing to scale the roof/ledge over to the front door and go knocking on neighbors doors or venture to the lobby in nothing but a smile. For this my friends happened to me. Thankfully, our neighborhood heard my calls for help and called the lobby for assistance. Within 10 minutes security had arrived to let us in and then another 10 minutes someone else came to check in on us. For whatever reason our latch get moving into the locked position everytime we closed the door. Even when we unlocked it prior to closing. From then on after we placed a facecloth in between the slider and the jam. Please PM with any questions and I will be happy to respond. I will be posting some photos shortly, but need my hubbys help for that. Have a great vacation at the Majestic I know we did and will be going back soon.

<Content>Great customer service from Guest Services Our stay was great. We were part of a wedding party and everyone seemed particularly pleased with the rooms, servcice and restaurants. The staff at guest services were wonderful, especially Angel Perez and Angela Anyela. Angel was particularly helpful to me in returning some personal items to us that I left behind in our room when we left. His willingness to help, and willingness to perserve on my behalf when arranging for a courrier provided to be dificult must be acknowledged. His service was beyond the oridinary, and greatly appreciated JM, Orangeville, Ontario, Canada

<Content>Loving the Majestic I've just returned from a 12 day holiday with my boyfriend to the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana  it was fantastic...so much better than I / we had expected. The resort itself was beautiful (true to all the pics we'd seen)  we noticed just how hard everyone works there. I felt as though they really took pride in the hotels appearance. There was somebody everyday, cleaning floors, polishing staircases, cleaning  filtering the pools, maintaining the gardens  shrubs etc. Everyone was very friendly which made it a very relaxing place to be  the Animation Team staff were superb. They work such long hours  they are full of smiles  energy all the time. They don't pressure you into joining in with any of the games, however, if you do decide to take part, they are full of encouragement. Its not nice to pick favourites, but the people who stood out for me was HENRY, RAY, MELVIN, WALTER  EVALISA. They welcomed us every morning with big smiles, jokes, friendly banter  made us not want to leave! Their English was brilliant also. We will defintely be going back  we just hope that when we do, they are all still there.Our hotel seemed to be very popular for weddings, there was a wedding nearly everyday  they all looked amazing. The weather was great, very very hot, with a one or two welcomed cloudy days.The only negative point I would make is about the Mini Market. Not only is it very overpriced in there, but the staff are very rude  unhelpful  at times could be very intimidating. I heard that they are independant staff  not direct staff of the Majestic Hotel, so just bare that in mind! Other than that, I couldn't fault it! :o)

<Content>the very best! My husband and I just got back from a one-week stay at the Majestic Colonial. We absolutely could not say enough great things about this resort! It was absolutely stunning (exactly like all of the pictures - or even better!). The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and polite. The food was excellent - especially the steak house down at the beach (and the Italian buffet)! The pool was fabulous - we especially loved that you can swim all the way from the front lobby down to the beach! I could go on and on. We're already planning our next trip to the Majestic... Now that we've been there, we can't imagine going anywhere else!!! By far - THE VERY BEST!

<Content>Excellent Kids Club Ms. Maggie at the Kids Club was great! She was so good with the kids. They had their own swimming pool with 2 small water slides. The inside section was available for the kids to watch movies in the afternoon when it was really hot. There was also an area for the kids to do crafts too. It was very clean. She took them to lunch at 12:30 and we would pick them up.Thanks Maggie!Debbie

<Content>Amazing staff and amazing resort!!!! Well i'll try and be as brief as i possibly can but right from the start through to the end both myself and my girlfriend were amazed with not only the hotel but also the staff.We were greeted by a friendly face offering us a refreshing cold towel and cocktail and a bell boy to take our cases to our room. The room was impressive, bed was much bigger than an english kingsize bed and we had a sea view which we hadn't bargained on. There is however a building site opposite as they are building a new adults only majestic hotel (apparently to be finished september 08 time) but it wasnt noisy and didnt bother us at all.The pool is very large and the animation staff constantly keep you entertained. It can be noisy at times but you can easily move away from the noise to a quiet area. I have to give a big thumbs up to Henry, Ray, Melvin and Walter (infact the whole team) as they made a good holiday a very special one.Restaurants had plenty of variety and all the barman were always happy to serve you. Make sure you book the japanese and the al a carte as soon as you book in as you miss out on some top nosh. If you have a chance to grab dinner on the beach ($150 per couple) i'd reccomend it, your treated like royalty.The gym was ok, some of the machines were out of order and it was pretty small but nicely air conditioned.Games area was also ok to pass the time during those hot hot sun hours.Michael jackson show is a must see in the theatre area!!! Great fun.The one only thing i will complain about is the mini market shop. They obviously do not work for the majestic because they are some of the rudest people i have ever met. They never have change and expect you to go away and find the correct amount, they over charge on all there products and i met a lovely Irish couple whom had a full blown row with them over buying a lighter??Wasn't enough to dampen our holiday though and would strongly reccomend this resort to anyone wishing to visit the Dominican.

<Content>Beautiful Resort All together their was 7 of us. My parents and my 18 year old daughter in one room and in another room my husband and two young boys. We had a blast!!!! The rooms were big, clean enough - I am a clean freak, so give me a half an hour and some 409 I would of felt much better about the cleanliness of the room. Also I noticed that the glass doors in the shower and the toilet area did not get touched by the cleaning crew and we were there from the 17th to the 25th but other than that it was great. They did actually wash the floors everyday in the rooms.The staff was wonderful, friendly. We did have a hard time the first night getting pillows - I don't think they understood english very well but that's okay we managed.I want to go back right now we had such a great time. We did two excursions while we were there - The Bavarro Splash - was the best - you drive your own speed boat fit for two people and then you go snorkeling. It was soooo much fun. The Caribbean Festival was another excursion - I would not go on this again it just didn't compare to The Bavarro excursion.I want to say hello to Denny our Beach Consierge - he was very friendly, courteous and was always making sure we were taken care of. I told you I would email Denny!! We are the large family with Samantha, Garritt  Chaney.This resort had great entertainment at night also for the kids. Loved the pool. This is a place you have to stay at!!!!Thanks,Christine AucoinHenniker, NH

<Content>My Majestic Experience!!!! Buenos dias amigos and amigas!Just back from the majestic Majestic........could have stayed at least another week! It was absolute paradise from the moment we stepped out of the transfer van until we left. The Majestic shines in every way.... We were welcomed with our cool towel and of course given our Majestic drink..I then met my dear friend, RICHARD....an outstanding man. He is truly a gem and the Majestic was very savvy in hiring him for a role that was obviously meant for him. He is a virtuous man who will do everything in his power to ensure your experience is as magical as possible. He is definitely a huge asset to this resort and responsible for it's high rating. Everyone we talked with raved about him, both personally and professionally.We were shown to our room (#2345) by Richard and were blown away by the incredible and tasteful decor. It was a standard room, no upgrade and none needed unless you want an outdoor jacuzzi and private terrace with room service. We don't spend much time in our room so we did not feel the extra money was worth it, would rather spend it on other things. Our room had a beautiful view of the pool, actually very close to the pool bar but on the third floor....excellente! When you close the slider, you could not hear anything at the pool bar which closes at 6:00 P.M. so no worries about noise at all. To the left was a majestic view of the ocean....gorgeous, romantic and lovely. Each morning I spent time on my terrace with my coffee and book. Wish I were still there...need I say more? The room also has a nice jacuzzi tub just as you step outside the enormous shower. The toilet is not as I was visualizing...it is NOT in the middle of the room and it has ample privacy. The only difference is the frosted glass door that you cannot see thru does not go floor to ceiling so this may be a problem if you have teens in the room with you but for most people, teens in the room is not a vacation. It is a very romantic setup. Lovely marble everywhere and a king sized bed that I found to be extremely comfortable, no mattress topper needed...slept like a baby the entire time. Maid service was very good. One day I was missing face cloths, not a deal breaker to us like it seems to be for some, but later our maid brought us some. The towels are huge and luxurious....we felt pampered in every way!The food has been the subject of many negative comments but we enjoyed the food very much. The supreme buffet had something for everyone and if you could not find anything, then an all inclusive is not for you. They serve everything from pasta to veggies to fruit to rice...and a carving station each evening for dinner plus pizza each night along with delicious homemade pastries to enjoy. We also ate at the Japanese restaurant, my husband's favorite, my second favorite, and at my favorite, the Mexican/Domincan restaurant. I didn't bother with the mexican food but my husband enjoyed his. I loved the Domincan food, delicious slow roasted pork with bean stew and Domincan rice...sooooo delish! We went twice :)!!!! The beach was gorgeous, as previously reported. My husband brought snorkeling equipment and saw fish, octopus and sea creatures which thrilled him, things I don't want to see, thank you. I swam and swam in the ocean each day and totally enjoyed the water, never looking down to see the creatures I don't care to meet. Just a beautiful beach! I spent time at the pool to be with travelbums because they prefer the pool and it was very nice as pools go. Not a pool person at all but it was very clean. I can't go into detail about it because I really don't know what constitutes a great pool. This was the first time I ever even stepped foot in one in the DR as it seems pointless to me to swim in a pool when nature is so beautiful there...to me, the ocean is the second most precious resource found in the DR, the first being the incredibly humble people.That brings me to my favorite asset the Majestic has...it's employees. As I said, Richard has become a friend. I also must comment on the wait staff...they are incredible. It saddens me that I rarely saw people leave even a dollar as a tip. It is a personal choice but to me, the service being as outstanding as it was definitely deserves a tip. The service at this resort is the best I have ever encountered. Everyone I spoke with agreed. My coffee cup was never less than half full. My plate was always taken away in a timely fashion. My water glass was always full. When I was served a house wine I didn't care for, I was offered another and it was delicious..and I am a wino! If you are looking for personalized service, this is your resort. I also have to mention my new friend, Jenny....the best hostess in Punta Cana, hands down! She gives a whole new meaning to the word welcome. Each morning she greeted my husband and myself with a warm smile and eventually a morning hug....she is a wonderful woman and the Majestic is lucky to have her. Sitting in my seat I watched her as she greeted everyone upon entering the buffet....what an asset she is to the Majestic! I also must mention my friend DENNY, the beach concierge, who was very attentive, always checking to make sure we were hydrated! This guy is something else! He works the beach with real class....this guy is a real professional that makes a great stoli and tonic with just the right amount of fresh squeezed lime...yummmmm! Denny, where are you???????? I miss you! Something that struck me about the employees is the fact that each one that I chatted with commented on how well they are treated by management at the Majestic. That makes me feel good about spending my vacation there. I guess that is probably part of the reason that the service is so excellent there. Happy employees make happy customers......My husband enjoyed the kayaks and had fun playing in the waves each day while I swam and watched him :)As you can tell, we love the Majestic and hope to return when we are able. We would love to even try out the new Majestic Elegance, which is slated to open in the Fall of this year. I am sure it will be every bit as lovely.In closing, I would like to thank everyone who helped me choose this resort as we were undecided which one to chose. Without tripadvisor, we may have never met all of our new friends and stayed at such a magical place...thank you!And thank you Richard, Denny, Jenny and all the wonderful staff at the Majestic for making us feel so special as we celebrated our anniversary!

<Content>Best we have ever been to!!! Lets start at the airport....Once you fight off the Porters you have about 25 steps to the buses and taxis so there isnt a need for them. We took a taxi from the airport to the resort. Cost us $35 USD, but a word of warning..... Keep your eyes closed or out the side of the car. The taxi drivers are a little braver then most but they get you there in a hurry.Once we arrived at the resort (about 30 mins from the airport) we met up with Richard. Richard is one of the front desk managers in charge of guest relations. One of the other trip advisor writers put us in touch with him and it saved us alot of aggrevation. He had our room where we asked for it and everything we needed to know he would answer the questions within a day or so. Everyone at the resort is extremly helpful and curtious. Richard took us for a tour of the resort and explained alot to us which cut down on the getting lost the first day. Our room was amazing.... It was very large and well dressed. The bathroom tub is out in the open but the rest is great. We had our four year old with us, when we got to our room Richard asked if we wanted a brib or a bed for our daughter. We asked for a bed thinking we would get a cot, but to our amazement we got a single bed frame and all. The rest of the room was great. We were on the first floor in room 1148. Which is almost at the beach. It was a long walk to the lobby and main buffet, but for the pool, the beach and beach buffet it was great.The restaurants and buffets..... what can I say... they were GREAT!!! The buffets are huge and have everything from fried food to vegetarian and diet food. The pasta bar was great and in the mornings the egg stations were amazing. The only complaint we had was that one of the restaurants we heard alot about (Le Gourmet) was adults only so we couldnt go there. The Japanese restaurant is a must do... They put on an amazing show for you and it isnt all fish. My wife doesnt eat fish at all and left that place stuffed to the gills.The pool is another part of the resort that I dont really have words for... It is absolutely an amazing site to see a pool that is that big. It took more than 20 minutes to go from one end to the opposite end. The only issue we had with the pool was that there is only one swim up bar and there is only three washrooms the entire length of the pool (behind the towel hut, behind the beach buffet, and in the lower lobby bar area). Other then that we spent alot of time with our lounge chairs in the water along the pools edge enjoying the weather. I suggest you all bring a cooly cup for your drinks so that you dont have to walk to the bar all the time. We brought two 52oz Bubba's and only had to fill them twice a day.We were all extremly happy with this resort. It was one of the biggest resorts we have ever been to, but there is so much to do and see and so much room that it never seems busy. This was the first resort also that we didnt have to search and search for a lounge chair. We always found one almost exactly where we wanted to sit. There is alot of chairs at the pool and the beach so there is always some empty ones. Other then that I dont know what else to say besides we absolutely loved this resort and would definitly go back for another visit, especially when they finish building the Majestic Elegance part of the resort.

<Content>Nothing but Wonderful! We got married at the Majestic on April 11 2008 with 16 guests and all I have to say is positive! This resort is amazing! The people who work there go out of their way to make your stay a memorable one!The wedding was by far a dream come true! I look at my pictures and I can't beleive I was really there!!The beach is simply beautiful and very clean! No weeds.The food of course is different from ours but very good!If you cannot find anything to eat in the buffet, you are ridiculusly fussy!!! SOOOOOO many choices! You can have pasta everyday if you want... Fresh fruits every meals... ton of yummy desserts... Chicken... Beef... A must have is the ChateauBriand at the Rodeo Restaurant! Yummy!The drinks are great! It seems that the Rum in the Dominican flows like water... lolWe attended a couple of shows during our 7 night stay and our favorite one was couple compitions which were just hillarius!Our Room... Let me tell you was Perfect! Huge!!! We had a 1 bedroom Colonial Suite and it was perfect since we all came together after the wedding dinner to make our speeches and have a cople of drinks. Beautiful!One little thing I would recommend is tto learn a bit of spanish before you go because there is a language barrier.. And watch the flowers they put everywhere in the bedroom... sometimes they have miniature ants in the stems... We just threw the flowers away.. Other then that, go on the Outaback Safari Trip! It's a great way to appreciate the Dominican Culture! This was a great Vacation! You will love it ! Don't worry!

<Content>Great resort, Managment should be over hauled April 26th - May 3rd Allow me to apologize for this very long review:We were suppost to arrive at the Majestic for a week starting April 26th. This was our honeymoon and I reconfirmed everything the day before. I was told that there was no problem. We checked in and the problems started.First they said they were over booked by about 60 rooms and they were so sorry but we would be bumped to another resort for two days. I asked them how we would get to that resort and they told me to call a taxi. After a few requests to the manager, our check in girl Sofia was able to get permission from the Majestic that they would foot the bill for the taxi. I was hot and tired so we poured ourselves into a taxi and headed for the Amber. The Amber by the way is a beautiful resort with wonderful staff and awesome food. So the next day we call the front desk at Amber to ask a question and they want to remind us that we have to check out at noon. I explained that we had reservations through the Majestic for two nights not one. They still insisted that we check out and return to the Majestic. So back into the taxi we went. We showed up at the Majestic and they informed us that the Amber had it wrong and that we do still have a reservation at the Amber for another night, then the person at the Majestic called the Amber and words were exchanged. They put us back into another Taxi and sent us back to the Amber. By this point I was pretty frustrated. Before I left the Majestic I spoke with Richard and asked him how we would get back to the Majestic on Monday. He said he would send over a customer relations person from the Majestic to bring us back to the resort around 1.We waited at the front desk area on Monday and by 2 it seemed as if no one was coming, so back into another taxi we went. By this time I was too sad about the situation to even be frustrated anymore, all I wanted to do was properly start my honeymoon in the resort I booked several months ago.We are told we would have to wait to check in and then directed to the upstairs lobby to do so. There were many people there that had been bumped including a family of 17 from Chile who had booked 6 months in advance. No one (that I spoke with) was picked up from the other resorts and everyone had to acquire their own taxis. I guess customer service forgot about all the other 60 plus people staying at other resorts. I do have to admit that the Majestic stepped up to the plate and paid for the Taxi鈥檚 every single time. So after a good long wait (No one offered drinks or towels or even a smile) we were allowed to check in. We were comped. We got free room service for our whole stay, free admission to Manti park, free horse back riding, 25 minutes a piece in the spa and free internet among other things. Due to all of the frustration I still can鈥檛 say bad things about the Majestic. The food was really good and we did not get sick one single time. The beach is pristine and there were plenty of chairs with shade to be had. The resort itself is beautiful (I think the Amber is prettier but that鈥檚 just me) and most of the staff were somewhat friendly. If you ask for strong drinks that鈥檚 what you get and all in all it鈥檚 a great resort.About the staff 鈥?Our house keeper was a real sweetheart as were most of the restaurant staff and bartenders. We did have a few instances were staff would go out of their way to avoid you and completely ignore you or act as if waiting on you was the last thing they wanted to do. They were rare however, and it would not have been such a big deal except that at the Amber all the staff was wonderful and full of smiles. Sofia at the front desk should be given a raise. She handled all the bumped people wonderfully and was the only person that said 鈥淚鈥檓 so sorry鈥? Laura at customer relations is also a true professional. If we had a problem or request she was quick to help. One side note 鈥?do not go the cigar shop at the Majestic. If you buy something and use a larger bill (say a 20) and expect change, just know that the guys in there will not give you change back unless you allow them to keep about 2.00 of your change for themselves. They are also pretty miserable acting.The shops on the Majestic property are crazy over priced but if you鈥檙e just looking for paintings and things like that just walk outside of the resort and there is plenty of shopping to be had. We got a really awesome painting (pretty big too) for 40 dollars. We did have to haggle but it was worth it and I think they enjoy the art of haggling. It was actually pretty fun! Also for my fellow smokers we got two packs of Marlboro for 6 dollars. They tell you they can鈥檛 make change but if you let them know you must have change they come up with all sorts of smaller bills for you. I can鈥檛 say as I blame them. They don鈥檛 make much money and what are a few extra bills if it helps them out?The spa is great and the girls working in it are top notch. We did not go see shows as that is not our thing and we didn鈥檛 hang around the animation team as that was not what we wanted on our honeymoon, but I did observe some games on the beach which looked like fun. People have said in other reviews that the rocks are very bad at the beach. There are a few large rocks in the water but if you move down just a bit it鈥檚 nothing but soft white sand.Whatever you are planning on bringing for tip money you should probably double it, some staff deserve good tips and there is no where to get change (unless you want to haggle for it). Most people we tipped a few dollars but every once and awhile we would feel the need to give 5 or 8, and you will too鈥?.so just bring more tip money than you expect. Also remember to tip your hostesses. They really don鈥檛 wait on the tables that much but they do work hard and I think they are forgotten.We did have an instance where a worker came into our room to install a shelf that we didn鈥檛 even know we needed and then came to us with his hand out saying 鈥測ou tip鈥?he was pretty aggressive about it so we did not tip. First off we didn鈥檛 ask to be disturbed on our honeymoon in the middle of the day to have a shelf installed that we didn鈥檛 even know was missing, and second I prefer to give tip money to nice polite people, not someone who is demanding it. So the house keeping got an extra dollar that day.We had no bugs in our room (I was hoping for a tarantula at least and I never saw one). We had a great view of the pool and our mini bar was overtly stocked. We tipped everybody but I think we would have gotten great service even if we hadn鈥檛. Also 鈥?I did see some other guests treating the staff rudely and then not tipping them. I saw one man reach around a female at the lunch buffet and grab some food and began chomping on it like a fat cow in a field right there in line. I would just like to remind everyone that this sort of behavior is rude and makes us all seem like mindless eating machines with no thoughts for others.I did notice a change in service level when my new husband began speaking Spanish to the workers. He is not fluid at Spanish but knows enough to get by and after he tried to communicate with them using their language they were more open and friendly to us. I picked up a few words before leaving and learned a few more while there, and it really went along way. The bed was hard, very hard and uncomfortable but you do get used to it. I do think the Majestic should invest some money in new mattresses but it鈥檚 not a reason to not book this resort. I was told to bring my own pillow top cover but with US Air making all their new baggage limits and restrictions I just didn鈥檛 have room for it. If you will be flying an airline that still allows a few bags to be checked (other than just one) then it would be a really smart thing to bring.One word of caution. Mamajuana is evil. It鈥檚 good but evil. Everything else I could say has already been said by other reviews. The resort is wonderful, I just think that management should be over hauled and held accountable for their mess ups. I think if management would act a bit more professional and responsible the resort would climb up very quickly in ratings. In fact when you get down to it all our major problems were because of management or lack of management. If it had not been for the first two days of utter confusion I would have given this resort a 5. Richard was not to blame however, He seemed really concerned about the situation and I believe all of this was out of his hands but he was the one left to pick up the pieces. He did get us a great room when we did check in and he is a super friendly person. I hope the Majestic knows what they have in him.Feel free to email me with questions.

<Content>Amazing!!! This property was incredible. The service incomparable. The people amazing. The beaches spectacular, the rooms gorgeous, well maintained. Could not ask for better value for the dollar then this anywhere. Denny; beach concierge could not have been more gracious. People are friendly but not over imposing. We just celebrated my parents 50th wedding anniversary at this resort. All nine of us, as a family. Have not vacationed together in over 10 years and wondered how it would all go, could not have asked for more. We plan to return. Thanks to all of you, Well done, good job!!P.S. Spend just a little time on improving food, choices etc. Just a tiny bit of constructive criticism.

<Content>Greatly Exceeded Our Expectations My wife, 2+ year old daughter and I stayed at the Majestic from April 19-26. We were getting a little worried about whether we made the right choice after the string of bad reviews the Majestic was getting. However, all of those worries were quickly erased. The Majestic is a great resort, from its location, to its people, to its services.We had never traveled with our daughter, so most of the worries were rooted in would she like it, would there be enough to do, and would she like the food. While my wife and I had a great time, our daughter had an even better time. For her, the pool was fantastic. It is so large that you can just go on a float tour from end-to-end and she thought that was so much fun. The beach was our afternoon destination and it was great for her too, from the water to building sand castles. Maybe one of my only gripes (and this is also geared to the guests) was the beach could get quite littered with cups, straws, and cigarette butts by the afternoon. There were many other families at the Majestic and our daughter made a lot of friends throughout our stay.As for the food, which was our greatest worry of all, we were simply blown away. We've never been to an all-inclusive, but we've heard the horror story of terrible food. Now, our family really enjoys good food and cooking and the food at the Majestic was very good. We all over ate. We would have breakfast and lunch at the main buffet. Breakfast was amazing and such a great way to start the day. Lunches were very good with new choices all the time. For dinner, we did the buffet twice, the steakhouse twice, the Mexican/Dominican restaurant twice, and seafood place once. None of us can raise one complaint about the meals we had. Our daughter also really enjoyed the food.The Majestic staff were just so friendly. Mercedes, one of the hostesses in the main buffet, was so good to our daughter. Our daughter had to get her daily kiss from Mercedes. Nelson in the seafood restaurant was hoot. He quickly learned our names, gave us fantastic service, and never let our drinks get half empty. Richard invited our family to a private cocktail party to share our Majestic experience with other guests as well as the resorts management. He deserve kudos for making sure everyone has a great time. Thank you Richard for putting us in a great room as we requested in our email. I don't think we could've had a better room (3343), just a few rooms down from the beach with a great view of both the beach and pool.This vacation was for pure relaxation and for our daughter to have a good time. Both of those agendas were accomplished. We did not participate any of the daytime or nighttime entertainment. The nightly entertainment started far too late for us. If you want a great vacation with good price, the Majestic is a fantastic choice. There's a lot to do for everyone and you can make it as fun or relaxing as you'd like. Thanks for the great time we had and we'll always remember it.

<Content>bumped into paradise Hello, Just returned from a week in The Majestic Colonial, we stayed there by default. We had originally booked to stay for 14 days in Gran Bahia Principe (hotel next door, read our review under Gran Bahia Ambar) On arrival to RD we were told that even though we were due to go to Gran Bahia, they had overbooked the hotel(apparently, they are well known for overbooking) so myself and partner and approx 11 other groups from First Choice Holidays were given rooms in Majestic Colonial for 1 week. After a long journey from London UK we were disappointed as we had done our research and chosen the Bahia. We were offered $400 cash plus VIP wristbands to both Majestic and Bahia, free safety deposit box in the room. So being quite adventurous and the offer of money also helped, we accepted (although we did'nt really have a choice) There were a lot of very angry people, that we think must of spent the whole time moaning and complaining, they were still complaining on the way home, we didn't want to waste energy on the negative so we chilled and got on with it. We arrived at the Majestic and were very impressed and went about getting checked in etc. Concierge took us to our rooms and although the room was nice, it smelt like it hadn't been used for a very long time and the reason being that 10 metres outside our patio door was a construction site and every thing was covered in grey dust. We both like sitting on the balcony with a beer and felt that it was adding insult to injury that not only had they moved us to a different hotel that they thought it really good to put us in the construction site!! Several of the bumped guest from The Bahia got these rooms.So off to reception and spoke (not shouted or demanded) to Francisco who promised us that we would be moved first thing in the morning and nearly true to his word, we were at midday moved to the other side of the hotel with wonderful sea views + champagne on arrival. The room was great but very bizarre having jacuzzi (which was great fun) in room along with your toilet and shower!!!! We are a couple, but some things need to be kept private. The maid was good, room always spotless, lots of towel art, no problems with replenished bar stock or towels, although they did seem to arrive at differing times in the day. Left good tips for both.The resort was lovely, reception and lobby bars stunning as with all the surrounding grounds, well maintained, gardeners working non stop. Theatre shows not really my scene but good entertainment, especially the circus. Earlier in that evening there were stilt walkers, children riding unicycles, fire eaters, fantastic to watch while enjoying a drink. Each night a band played music anything from romantic to salsa and cha cha cha, brilliant to watch people of all nationalities and ages dancing and enjoying themselves. The one thing noticed here is that there were lots of nationalities from all over the world, brilliant, not just USA or Canada( they are the ones with the thermal giant size mugs, they seem to take everywhere, even in the pool or sea, what is that all about,lol !)Later in the evening there is a disco where you could boogie until 3am again mixture of all kinds of music. Plus small casino which was ok.We are beach lovers but the pool was probably the best we've seen, runs the whole length of the resort like a snake with several bridges, swim up bar, pool bar etc. Never felt crowded at all, lots of loungers although not too many in the shade. Lots of activity around the pool. Areobics, dance classes, games etc. People have mentioned that the music was loud, constant merengue and salsa, we loved it, this what the caribbean is all about, very lively. It was quiet in the evening and at night when it needed to be. The beach was lovely, not to many loungers and gave the feeling of space,definately the best bit of beach with a ledge, if you walk 10 mins to the right outside the Bahia you cannot see the beach for people and loungers, not our idea of fun! Looked a bit like Benidorm or Blackpool in high season.(the British will understand this lol) Also on the beach you could do stretching exercises and water areobics, this was usually in the mornings, again not too in your face. Quiet in the afternoon. Great beach BBQ and beach party.Food!!! We love good food and although this wasn't the best food wev'e had, for an all inclusive it was pretty good, lots of choice in the buffet for both breakfast and dinner and good steak and seafood in a la cartes. Japanese was great fun, not too authentic but the chef show cooking and his assistant were great fun, good tasting food, lots of toasting and drinking Mamajuana, wow it slips down a treat!! thouroughly great evening and a great way of meeting other guests. Met people from Russia, hi to Katya and Sergei. Netherlands, Argentina and France who sure know how to party.What truly stands out at this resort is the friendliness of all the staff, there was very rarely a grumpy face or bad service. The restaurant service was efficient and quick, the staff in hotel next door where we stayed the 2nd week could learn a great deal in customer relations and customer service from the staff at The Majestic Colonial. There were a few things that you could moan about but it was such a great atmosphere that they just faded in to oblivion after a nano second. The one and only small criticism is there are no drinks menus on the bars, so if you are not good remembering cocktails or drink mixes you seem to stick to the ones you already know. However we did see some interesting looking cocktails and just asked the people who were drinking them, the names, another great way of getting to know people.We were very sad that we had to leave the MC at the end of the first week and go on to our original destination of The Bahia Principe next door. But now we have a comparison. We were upgraded into Ambar, adults only section, which was very pleasant, rooms beautiful, food good, but that dosen't mean anything if everyone around you is either of pensionable age, grumpy, have an air of self importance and thouroughly rude!!! What is it with people who pay money to go on holiday and then think it gives them the right to demand from staff rather than ask, what happened to 'Please my I have ......and 'thankyou' If we were to return to Republica Dominica , Punta Cana, for all it's splendour, Gran Bahia would not be our first choice. Thank you for bumping us to Majestic Colonial as this is where we will return to again. We loved itkind regardsFay and GeorgiLondon England

<Content>Our Honeymoon in Paradise Im going to take this step by step to give as accurate a view for those who may be hesitant to come here. First off, let me explain myself. Im picky, hard to please, with a very tempermental stomach. I have hard to reach standards and I also researched and read the reviews on here before going. Allow me to say, it exceeded my expectations in some ways, met them in others, and dissapointed in only a few. Let me also say, for the complainers on here that every trip is what you make of it. If youre cranky at home, then youll be cranky in paradise too.The airport is like a giant tiki hut, open air, you come down stairs straight thru to a little band playing and your baggage being immediate put on the belt. You go through customs and pay your $10 a piece to enter the country. No issues, very easy.The drive to our hotel was eye opening. A true look into a 3rd world country is jarring and made me appreciate everything that much more. It also made me understand their culture, customs and how hard they work for the little they have. Its a bumpy ride, if you get car sick- bring dramamine or put your head down. The hotel- gorgeous, manicured in every direction, the attention to detail is paramount. I never once had a complaint about the cleanliness or beauty of the resort. Native plants all around, palms, just awesome. The pool stretches on forever and is about 4ft all the way through. Chairs can be hard to come by under the palm hut's so reserve a chair in the morning w. your towel or something. We didnt have any issues it wasnt crowded. The beach is pristine, water was warm, lets just say I came back VERY tan. Our room was immediately upgraded to the 4th floor colonial or presidential (one of the 2) but it was awesome! 2 mini bars, big jacuzzi bath tub, the works! Being it was our honeymoon they put a banner on the door, it was so cute! We had champagne when we walked in the room, a bubble bath already made for us with petals everywhere. The chocolate bars in the fridge I loved. There was also complimentary liquor in our room but we arent too big of drinkers. El Presidente is their beer, its kinda like Budweiser. The majestic drink tastes like a creamsickle, the pina coladas were great. Service- Its just hot there so dont complain that things arent frozen solid like we have it here. Lets be real, youre in their country, deal w. it or get a insulated cooler thingy. Everyone we saw there from bellboys to our housekeeper, literally everyone on staff was so nice to us. I speak basic spanish which helped a bit, plus I think it was appreciated by them that I tried to speak some of their language for all the effort they put into learning english. My husband speaks no spanish except for cerveza and hola and he was just fine. Service was awesome, simple as that.Restaurants- We didnt like the seafood restaurant, just our personal opinion. The steakhouse chicken was good, my husband didnt like the chateaubriand. The buffet is always good- if you cant find something there, its your own fault. Omelettes every morning with nutella and crepes and these sugary churros I loved! La Gourmet is fantasic, I had the chicken, my husband had the filet both great! Taino (mexican) was really good, the steak can be overcooked so watch! The teppanyaki (sp?) was also a ton of fun, we had a good group sitting w. us and the food was excellent. All the bars are great... the swim up bar came in handy. Entertainment- for us, it was our honeymoon so the entertainment wasnt first on our list... haha... (again its not broadway its what you make of it!) They had volleyball, dancing, olympic games, etc etc... the animation team was a blast. Water aerobics, although I didnt join in was by far the funniest thing to watch. We didnt go on any excursions so I cant comment, we really stuck to our grounds. The vendors come out for a night and were very nice, you can haggle to about half of what theyre asking for stuff. Be aware for fake silver, amber and their native stone... Harrison's has real jewelry or some vendors have real stuff. Here's my final note, and by all means for those who may have questions we just got back Sunday May 4th so Im able to be reached regarding this, do your best to realize how hard these people work, make the best of everything, realize nothing and no where will ever be perfect but this place can be pretty close. We didnt get sick, we dont know how people could get sick, we had great service, we were nice to everyone and got the same in return. Tip well, its appreciated and its repaid 10x over. Have fun, enjoy it, take tons of sunscreen and lotion!

<Content>Our experience at the Majestic We vacationed in PuntaCana 4/26 鈥?5/3. It was wonderful. I would highly recommend it. We had a nice non-stop flight from BOS to PUJ both ways. Arriving in the PUJ airport was not a big deal. We quickly passed thru customs (paying $10 each) and got our bags. There are porters waiting for you and they are aggressive. I just ignored them considering my bags are on wheels. The bus transfer was easy to find. I booked my travel on-line using Delta Vacations (we flew USAir however, Delta changes their schedules to frequently for my tastes) and it included a round trip transfer. This was thru VIP. In retrospect I would have preferred to take a cab, because you have to share your ride with other people, which means you stop at a few hotels along the way. The ride took about 45 minutes. I would guess we could have done it in 30 but no big deal.For a reference, we booked our travel in Oct 2007 for 2 adults 2 children (17  13). The airfare was about $1800 out of BOS and One double bed room was $2200 for the week (Sat to Sat). This nice thing is you really don鈥檛 need to spend a whole lot more after this.This time of year there were no bugs that bothered us. The temperature is perfect and can actually be cool if the sun is not out but very hot when it is. Arrival at the Majestic went smoothly. I had emailed and called requesting a room in building 2 or 3 but ended up with 1335. I was a little worried but the room was fine. It was fairly close to the beach and we had a nice view of the ocean from our balcony. It was also away from the noise and very quiet at night. The bathroom everyone complains about is not that bad. The tub is totally in the open but the shower and toilet are hidden with frosted glass doors. The shower is large enough to change in if you want to. I am an early riser (7ish) and had no problem what so ever finding a palapa. There are plenty to choose from and seemed to be available until around 9 am. One complaint I had was that the coffee was up near the lobby. There was no coffee available near the beach. I would highly recommend (if you are a coffee drinker) bringing a large insulated coffee mug so you can fill it and return to the beach an still have hot coffee. The little cups they supply were just too small.One little trick people would play was to bring a $3 blow up raft and leave it wedged in between the chairs and the palapa overnight to save there spot. I would then see them roll out around 10 am and grab a front row palapa. The staff does not go around and remove things from the palapas at night. My son and I would walk the beach in the evening and remove all the floats from the palapas (hey you snooze you lose. Get up like the rest of us if you want a front row palapa! I think anybody reading this should do the same).I found the grounds to be beautiful and well kept. I did notice that the resort is new so the grounds are not quite as lush and mature as some of the other resorts, but still very nice. The beach and ocean were great. There is a reef about 100 yards out from the beach and you can see the waves breaking over the reef. This keeps the waves in front of the resort much smaller. This allows for the snorkeling to be great. There is a lot of coral and rocks and fish to be seen. We would bring some bread and feed the fish. The resort next door (to the left facing the beach) does not have the reef, so the waves are bigger and good for body surfing. The beach is enclosed by buoys but snorkeling outside of the buoys could be hazardous since a lot of boats go by especially in the afternoon.The pool is very impressive. I found the temperature of the pool to be very nice. About the same as the ocean. A little chilly for just a second or two and then you are used to it. The pool is huge and long. The depth is about the same thru out. There is a volley ball net that stretches across the pool at the pool bar which kind of forces you to get out of the water and go around.The food was very good. The only breakfast (7 鈥?10) is served in the big buffet up by the lobby. Later (10:30 鈥?12:30) there is a continental breakfast in the restaurant by the beach. I wish that this one was earlier since personally I would prefer just to have a more casual breakfast close by.I found the shows at night to be very entertaining. A little late at night for me (10pm) but a lot of fun. The shows that are just audience participation were not that interesting to me, but the magic show and the Michael Jackson show was great.My favorite bar was the one to the right of the main desk as you enter the resort. This bar had the good booze. Apparently if you are from North America you will get a grey bracelet and it entitles you to the premium liquor. There are also some liquors that are not included like Johnny Walker Black and Green as well as Grey Goose vodka. I would order Bombay Sapphire Gin martini鈥檚 which are included. I loved the way the bartenders would make the drinks. They do a really nice job making a mojito at this bar.We would head to this bar for cocktails before dinner. The area is open air with nice couches and live music on the piano. It was really pleasant to site there and sip you drinks. You could either get one at the bar or wait for the waitress.The pool bar was very convenient. You can swim right up to it and order your drinks. I found it crowed sometimes and hard to get a drink, but all you have to do is get out of the water and go to the other side where there is another bar that was less crowed.The flea market people talk about is about a 40 minute walk to the right down the beach. It鈥檚 a long walk (especially coming back) but I heard some people say you can get a water taxi back (not sure of the price). The shops are fun to see and there are a lot of harmless stray dogs laying around. The stores have your basic souvenir type items like wood statues and shells. They also have cigars and liquor but I have heard you may not get what you think (especially the cigars). They really put the pressure on and you need to haggle since the prices are absurdly high (I heard you should expect to pay 30% - 40% of what is asked). Be careful buying things made of leaves (not sure about wood) because they will be confiscated at the airport when you leave (I watched a lady lose here banana leaf hat).The cigar shop in the lobby wants $35 for a Cuban cigar and $6 for a pack of Marlboros.There are bicycles that you can use (we did not) somewhere on the resort but you can鈥檛 leave the front gate with them. The main lobby does not have change. So bring a lot of ones if you plan on tipping.Beware of your children and alcohol. My daughter is 17 and she had no problem getting served drinks. They do not have different colored bands so its up to the bartender to decide. In closing I would say you definitely cannot go wrong at the Majestic. It is a totally relaxing and beautiful place. If you are thinking of booking or already have, rest easy you will not be disappointed.

<Content>What Are People Talking About???? We were a little worried after reading several negative reviews on this site. The only thing I can say about those reviews are-- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT??? Let me break it down:The grounds are immaculate- cleaner than anywhere I have ever visited.The staff are out of this world. We absolutly loved Pablo at the piano bar. He is an excellent bar tender- excellent personality and VERY professional!! We wanted to take him home with us! The animation team is great. Walter you are the best-- he is like the energizer bunny- full of energy to keep the guests entertained! Melvin we loved your water aerobics. They did an excellent job. All staff at all restraunts were excellent-- very polite and VERY hardworking! The pool is spotless and beautiful as well as the beach-- much cleaner than some of the others!The food was decent- the steaks were great at the steakhouse and the gourmet rest. Fruit galore, deserts galore--- The Japenese was great- make a reservation upon arrival.Overall we absolutly loved it and would not hesitate to return!!!

<Content>family vacation enjoyed by all of us We live south of Boston and stayed at the Majestic Colonial over April school vacation 4/19-26/08. This is our fourth consecutive trip to the D.R, and second to Punta Cana. It was very enjoyable for me, my wife and twin 14 year old boys. This was our sixth all-inclusive vacation and one of our favorites. I must admit, with the rash of bad reviews a few months back, we had some anxiety, but it was completely unsubstanciated.Upon arrival we had no problems with our luggage or ground transportation. Check-in was fast and easy and both rooms were ready. The rooms are very large and clean. We had a king size bed and the boys had two full beds. Beds were firm but very comfortable. Pillows were thin but additional ones readily available. We were 3 rooms apart, on the third floor rooms 2310 and 2313 overlooking the pool. Very nicely located, across from the towel building and a bar, close to both the main buffet as well as the beach. There was a bottle of champagne in our room the first night, sushi and white wine delivered the second night, and a small bottle of rum and scotch left two other days. Very nice touches that were appreciated and enjoyed. The rooms were usually cleaned by early or mid- afternoon and towels often brought separately. We did not find the bathroom layout to be an issue, but if traveling with children and staying in one room, some may elect to change in the shower which is very spacious. Expect occaisional loss of power(very common in the D.R.) If it happens during the night, the a.c needs to be reset before it will come back on, otherwise it is just a matter of resetting the clock radio. Breakfast: main buffet 7-10:00am. excellent selection and quality! fresh eggs, omlets and crepes along with endless bottles of champagne. The beach restaurant also has breakfast available, but pre-made, nothing prepared fresh. There is even a coffee and juice bar set up in the morning for those that prefer their coffee first or do not want to use the in room coffee pot.Lunch : main buffet 12:30-3:00pm again very good selection. always cooking fresh pasta, steak, chicken, pork and fish. Plenty of variety and good quality. Beach buffet good but fewer options. Burgers, fried chicken, french fries and pasta. There was a beach BBQ on Sunday and giant paella on Thursday.Dinner: main buffet 6:30-10:pm. Lots to choose from with something for everyone. We always found the quality and quantity very good.The service was always very good, and language is certainly NOT an issue. If you go the main buffet for lunch and your bathing suit is at all wet, you will not be seated and asked to change. We found this out the hard way.Specialty restarants:Japanese: Very good. Only one plate of sushi per two people. For dinner, everyone gets to try steak, chicken, shrimp and fish.Steak: Outstanding. Soup or salad and steak. Chateaubriand was fantastic. Service exceptional!Chinese: unlimited sushi, which is very good. Main courses average, but certainly NOT authentic.Dominican/Mexican: Appetizes very good, well above average. Main courses good, steak seemed to be the best.Seafood: We all had the seafod bisque and lobster tails which were very good.The service was very good, certainly above average thougouht! Prompt, attentive and friendly. Anything you need or want will be provided by simply asking.The Pool: Absolutely amazing. Huge, clean and very enjoyable.The Beach. Spectacular for walking, lounging or swimming. More coral directly in front of Animation Team activities, better swimming to the right. On the weekend, there were plenty of chairs availble in the shade. However, during the week, we found it necessry to reserve a hut in order to be assured some shade.Bring plenty of sunscreen and reapply frequently. Do not pack in a carry-on bags if larger than 3 oz., or it will get confiscated. We did see a lot of people that were badly burned.The temperature of the water in both the pool and beach were slightly cooler than in the past. Refreshing, but once acclimated, can stay in for a long period if you choose to. It did rain several afternoons for an hour or two. This is typical for late April, early May in DR.Entertainment: Enjoyed the Michael Jackson show and the Circus. The Magic show was boreing and we left. We did not go to any of the audience participation shows.I bought individual Cohiba cigars from a local beach vender for $3/each. My wife and sons went to the local plaza(a 5-7 minute walk) to get a a few things. Don't bother with the vendors that come Thursday evening, more expensive than the gift shop with poorer quality.There were an average of two weddings a day and numerous large groups(10-60). Since we went over April school vacation, there were a big contingency from the northeast and numerous families.When departing, we met a gentleman at the airport who had left his wedding band in the safe in his room, with the door open. He immediately contacted the Majestic, who notified the cleaning people and the ring was found. I thought that was excellent customer service, and reflects the overall care of this resort.In speaking to several different groups from our area, rates did vary slightly depending on which agency you book through so be a educated consumer and compare. Also, if you have ANY special request, I would advise contacting Richard directly through Tripadvisor. You can expect a prompt response, and he will certainly try to accomodate based on availability.For each and every member of our family, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Majestic and would certainly return. For those who have written negative reviews, perhaps they would have been better served eating at a 5 star restaurant, ordering an expensive bottle of wine and then taking in a Broadway performance. Probably would spend the same amount of money, but what would they do the other 6 days and would miss out on the pool and beach. To each his own!I hope this has been helpful and would be certainly willing to answer any specific questions at jamindux@comcast.netRegards, Joe

<Content>The Majestic is Magnificent! After researching and planing and reading the many reviews on this property and anticipating, I can't believe my visit is over and I am home and now I get to write a review!I will try not to duplicate what has already been said this beautiful property!First of all, a special thank you to Richard. He is a wonderful, gentle and sincere individual who is true to his word when he says please let him know how he can make your stay enjoyable! He goes above and beyond! I do not know how he does it all! Responding to questions in the forums, updating his own web site and being there for the many guests !His favorite expression is come with a smile! And now I know why! The staff is incredible! From the chambermaids to the grounds people to the wait staff, a simple Hola will bring the warmest smile and start your day on a positive note!The staff is constantly working! From painting a light fixture, to the walls in the lobby, to raking the beach, they never stop! The wait staff in the various restaurants are fantastic! A special note of thanks to Jenny! She would go out of her way to make the day special! And was so great with her Spanish lessons for my wife and myself!It is true that all the items are not labled at the buffet however all one has to do is ask what an item is and the staff is more than happy to let you know what it is We were fortunate to be able to get reservations for both the Japanese and the Gourmet Both were unique and delicious!My favorite though was the Steak House which we visited twice,once to try the chateaubriand and the second time a sirloin! Both were fantastic!The pool and the beach were beautiful! In all honesty, it was harder to find a lounge in the shade at the pool than at the ocean!The evening shows were fun and enjoyable! My favorite being the African Show on the beach! The dancing and the costumes were a treat!So, yes...the Majestic lives up to its name!In summary, would I go back? In a heart beat! I just can wait for the new sister hotel to open this fall as it is suppose to be even better!

<Content>A Beautiful Deal My sister and I stayed at this resort from Apr 26 - May 2, this year, 2008. Oeverall, it was a great experience and we are considering coming back to the Majestic. We still can't believe we stayed at such a beautiful place with such great service for the amount of money we paid. A complete steal. We booked this trip through cheapcaribbean.com.  It takes about 45 minutes to get there from the Punta Cana airport. When we arrived (close to 3pm) our room wasn't ready. I was not happy about this but since we were starving our main priority was to eat. We went to the Supreme, one of the resort's buffet restaurants. We ate there during most of our stay. We tried two other restaurants but the Supreme seemed to have the most options. We did not try the food in the two reservation only restaurants so I can't comment on those. As for the others, the food was okay. We had no food related sicknesses during our trip. I tried a lot of different dishes and found that most were okay and a few were really good. My sister who is a picky eater found the food to be good. I wouldn't come back here if I measured this trip solely based on food but check the other reviews for comments on the two reservation only restaurants (Le Gourmet and Matsuri) because the food their might be really good.  We spent our days going back and forth between the beach (absolutely beautiful clear water and white soft, sand) and the pool. For both the beach and the pool, if you want a chair under a palapa to cover yourself from the sun, I suggest you get their early (between 8 and 8:30) or before you have breakfast, take your towels and leave them on the chairs you want. This way they will be held until you return. We didn't always get there early or leave towels on the chairs and we were still able to find palapa covered seating, it just would take a lil bit of walking back and forth and possibly sitting in an area too far from the water or the bar. I simply cannot express how beautiful the beach is. The photos on their website come close but in person it is something else. The pool which goes up and down the length of the resort is so big that at times you feel like it is your own pool. No matter where you are in the pool there is a bar close-by, not to mention the swim-up bar. All of it is absolutely gorgeous. They have bridges going across the pool at different spots, just beautiful.  The service, whether being given by the front desk attendant, housekeeper, mini-bar refiller, bartenders, waiters/waitresses, managers, porters, security personnel, or towel attendants, is exceptional. You are treated as though you woke up that morning as Queen Elizabeth. My sister and I are a bit shy and like to keep to ourselves. The bartenders/waiters are so friendly that they ask you not only if you are enjoying yourselves but where you are from and so on. They might have spoken to my sister and I more than others because we speak really good Spanish and this would pique their interest as to where we learned to speak the language. So for most people who are not social anxiety-prone this would not be a problem but instead a plus. Even though this turned us off a bit (again for people who don't mind a lil small talk this is no big) we decided that we would still like to come back beacause of the sheer beauty of the resort. Even if you do not have an ocean-view or poolside room, you are still surrounded by such beautiful gardens and fountains. Please remember to tip the staff. They'll give you great service regardless of how you do or don't tip but they are not paid very much, work twelve days in a row with three days off in between, and our tips make all the difference. The great price you will get to stay at this resort should make tipping easier for all.  You will find a lot of Germans, French, and Spaniards visiting this resort. Mainly Europeans with the balance being Canadians and Americans. A lot of families and couples. Not big with the young, single crowd. If you are young and single you are probably going to want to go off the resort for the clubs. Taxis should make this no problem. Otherwise, they have nightly entertainment. A movie at 8pm, a show (usually a performance of some kind) at 10pm and an on the property disco/sportsbar after the performance. The shows are pretty good. Whether it is cheesy/funny or just plain good, you will enjoy it. During the day they also have activities you can participate in led by the animation team.  The only area of major concern for us was that we overheard a guest being asked to sleep at a neighboring resort for one night because they did not have room for him. This was disturbing because the guest had reservations and were there for a wedding but for some reason there was no room. I don't know if this is a common occurrence when vacationing but it happened to them. Even with that knowledge the place is so beautiful and they are so nice, I want to go back as soon as possible.

<Content>Missing the taki taki dance! Stayed at the Majestic from April 19-26 and absolutely LOVED it! There were at least 2 weddings being held on the grounds each day. Had no stomach issues at all (and I ate salad for 2 of 3 meals each day and brushed my teeth with tap water) and always found something that I wanted to eat. Yes, the wine was not superior, but having been to DR before, I was not expecting it to be. However, it was drinkable. I loved being given the signature Majestic drink during check-in and my friends and quickly took to drinking that with a healthy dose of Brugal. Also, try the Dirty Monkey, a chocolate/banana concoction that makes you forget you are drinking an alcoholic beverage. Spent each day at the beach and then finished late afternoon hours at the pool. When at the beach, be sure to say hello to Denny, the beach concierge for the Majestic. He was wonderful and made sure to keep us supplied with Majestics, Dirty Monkeys and plenty of bottled water. Be sure to make reservations for the Japanese or French restaurants as soon as you get there, if you are interested, because they book up quickly. Ate most of our dinners at the buffet, in order to cater to the many tastes of the group I was traveling with (there were 7 of us). The one downside was the amount of young kids taking advantage of the lack of a drinking age. Having to deal with them in the Disco at times was annoying, but we made the best of it. (Being a teacher, I am forced to travel when most kids have off from school.) The Animation Staff was a blast, especially Francisco, Walter, Ray  Melvin. Make sure you catch the Men vs. Women show at the theater, as well as the Circus. Would definitely go back.

<Content>Beautiful location for a wedding We went to the Majestic Colonial for a wedding in March. Actually, we were hired to photograph the wedding. Hotel is beautiful and has great rooms with wonderful amenities. Particularly like the jacuzzi in the middle of the bathroom! And, food and service at the wedding were excellent.To view some of our photos from the wedding, click on the following posting on our Blog:http://funicostudios.com/funicoblog/?p=162

<Content>Bad and Ugly, with very little good! My wife and i booked our trip to the Majestic in Oct. of 07' Upon arrival at the hotel we were advised as well as many other guests that the hotel was Over-booked by as many as 60 rooms and for 2 nights we would have to stay somewhere else. We attempted to get them to place us at the RUI as we had friends staying there, however they insisted that they did not have an agreement with them and we would have to stay at the Gran Bahia. Note to yourselves, Stay at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar section if you truely want the 5 star experience. We were offered some lame excursions, free internet, free room service, and VIP treatment at Majestic, we were also more than welcome to go back and forth from the resort as we please. How pointless to have to commute to your resort, and free internet????Ok, so we served our time at the Bahia which to our dismay was the best part of our vacation. The majestic is far from 5 star. I happen to think the breakfast was the worst meal and the others are very so so. The room: I forgot to mention we cut our trip short and came home early. The room smelled like mold and according to my allergies and how stuffed up I am and was every morning there was a lot of mold in that room. Horrible bed, actually broken and leaned to one side. Nothing in this place says 5 stars, nothing. It screams for a 5 star rating and outwardly appears as such, but never lives up to it's obligations to be an actual 5 star resort. Service was scetchy as it alway is in Punta Cana, nothing new to report there, but out of all the places we have been in Punta Cana, Barcello Beach, Palace, Bahia, this place had the nastiest room. Our friends stayed at RUI Naiboa a resort that was not 5 star according to Victor at Majestic. Guess what, their room didn't smell like a mold experiment for the local science fair. In the end, we left early as I kept getting sicker and sicker the more nights I slept in that room. During the day I would fight off everything and feel ok, but as soon as I stepped foot into that room I felt miserable. I know that when your on vacation you should never attach any value to the room because you don't want to spend all day in your room in the first place, but when it makes you sick to sleep in your room that's a problem. In the end, they should have never been in a situation to have overbooked by so many rooms, and they should have never placed us in the Bahia. I'll be writing my review of the Bahia soon. The majestic seemed like a serious step-down from the Bahia and they need to do their homework on where they send other guests because I can think of 4 people that will not be staying at the Majestic ever again. Can't believe I am just happy to be home!

<Content>Going through Majestic Colonial withdrawal Just returned from a stay at the Majestic Colonial (April 24-29). Hopefully I can provide a different perspective 鈥?went on a much-needed girlfriend getaway, both of us in our mid-20鈥檚. A first-timer to Punta Cana and extensive traveler with high standards, the MC exceeded my expectations. I found little to complain about.Grounds are lush and gorgeous, rooms are clean and spacious and the beach left me speechless 鈥?soft white sand, turquoise water, comfortable loungers and a nice breeze. Started each day on the beach then moved up to the pool/pool bar in the late afternoon (where it was a little more rowdy) to take part in the games/dancing put on by the Animation Team. The taqui taqui song is still stuck in my head! Our daily routine continued with a nap and showers, dinner at 8, show at 10 and then the disco until our feet were sore from dancing.Those who prefer more quiet or to turn in early, rest assured that there are plenty of quiet spots throughout the beach and pool areas and I heard hardly a noise while in our bedroom (building 2).Best of all was the friends we made at the MC. A very special hola to REY and TONY (and the entire Animation Team). The staff here works extremely long hours for weeks at a time and somehow manage to have a smile and boundless energy every minute of the day. That is a lot more than most of us could ever manage. Gracias to JORGE (our favorite baseball pitcher), SANTA and DAMIAN 鈥?talk about service with a smile. More hola鈥檚 to our friends from Brooklyn and the Canadian wedding (especially the man who did the full monty)!Must address the two biggest complaints: food and stomach issues. Stuck with made-to-order omelets and crepes at the Supreme Buffet and salad, fruit and sandwiches for lunch (no tap water). Brought granola bars/crackers for late-night sustenance or when we were too lazy to go get food. I especially enjoyed my meals at Le Gourmet (red snapper), Rodeo Steakhouse (chateaubriand) and Tres Carabellos (grouper). Experienced no stomach issues whatsoever (and I was nervous) and not a single hangover despite LOTS of rum 鈥?this resort/island must be magic! Try a Majestic or Banana Mama (con mucho rum) and the mamajuana, if you dare!Tips: Brush up on your Spanish 鈥?it makes a real difference to actually be able to have a conversation; a dollar or two really goes a long way; leave the watches/cell phones at home or in the safe and make the best of your trip at the MC.Feel free to message me with any questions/comments or an hola if we met you during our stay!Muchas gracias,Katie (and Shannon)New Jersey

<Content>Great, Relaxing Vacation Stayed at the Majestic from April 11-18 and had a wonderful time. MANY thanks to Richard for accomodating our requests. Our room was spectacular (Colonial Junior Suite - room 2409) near the center of the resort overlooking the pool. We couldn't have asked for a nicer setup. The pool was huge and very clean. Beach was very nice and the breezes were very welcomed in the sun and heat. Food was just okay but the breakfast buffet was very good. My wife and I really enjoyed the French restaurant and made reservations twice. Japanese restaurant was excellent and a lot of fun. Didn't venture off resort except once. All of the bartenders/servers were very friendly and helpful.A couple negatives: lack of nightlife at the resort. Wasn't much to do after dinner unless you wanted to wait until 10 or so for the shows. Sports Bar showed movies each night instead of sports. Casino could definitely use an upgrade (cards looked like they've been used since 1990).Overall, a nice, relaxing resort. Would definitely return if we came back to Punta Cana.

<Content>Everything but the FOOD!! FIRST IMPRESSION: Great - the cold towel and tropical drink were very welcoming.CHECK-IN: Not impressed. We asked for a room away from construction (which we got), but were told that the room wasn't ready. Interesting, as it was almost 3pm which is check-in time. We were told to have a late lunch at the buffet and come back in about 30 min. Upon returning, the person originally helping us completely ignored us. We ended up being helped by another staff member, but he couldn't find our check-in papers and was running around discombobulated for at least 15min. The original staff member continued to ignore the whole situation. We finally got checked in though, and didn't get bumped to another resort as some others had in previous reviews.ROOM: Majestic Colonial is advertised as a 4-star hotel, but is actually around a 3-star if you are going by US standards. It was nice having a hot tub in the room, but the open bathroom wasn't ideal. It wasn't an issue for my boyfriend and I, but I think that most people prefer privacy when using the toilet.RESORT: Absolutely beautiful and picturesque. They work hard to maintain the grounds and it shows. Pool winds throughout the whole property and the temperature was always perfect. SPA: I got a 1 hr aromatherapy massage for $95 US dollars and it was pretty good. Spa facilities are nice and I think are supposed to be exclusive to guests who pay for spa services, however some kids infiltrated the outdoor spa retreat so we couldn't really relax out there after our treatments. The outdoor space would probably be relaxing otherwise.BEACH: Amazing! As others have commented, plenty of beach chairs for everyone. Each set of beach chairs had a magnificent view of the ocean and it did not feel crowded at all. There was some beach entertainment/activities that could get loud, but if you choose a spot away from that area, it won't be a problem. They also have staff from the bar periodically making rounds on the beach taking drink orders. There was a restaurant with bathrooms about 15 ft from the beach which was very convenient.FOOD: Definitely the downside of our trip. I was apprehensive about the food after reading so many negative reviews. Unfortunately, they are all true. Our dining experience at the Majestic Colonial was less than average AT BEST. The hibachi at the Japanese restaurant was edible but not great. DO NOT EAT A LA CARTE AT THE JAPANESE RESTAURANT!! Unless you are a fan of cheddar cheese sushi and sweet  sour dishes that are just plain SOUR. We took 1 bite and got up and left! Another night, we went to Le Gourmet and did the same thing - the food was horrible! And these are supposed to be the 2 best restaurants, both requiring reservations. On our way to the airport at the end our our trip, a couple in our van said they really enjoyed the Rodeo Steakhouse. My boyfriend and I didn't have the energy to try it after multiple bad experiences at the other restaurants. Looking back, we should have tried it because most reviews had good things to say about it. The only safe bet is the breakfast buffet, so fill up!! It's actually really good. All of that being said, you should take into consideration that my boyfriend and I are from NYC and are very spoiled when it comes to dining. Just lower your expectations and bring a lot of snacks!!ENTERTAINMENT: We enjoyed the live jazz shows every night. The theater shows are just plain corny!! Giant chess was fun, and we had a good time at the casino.CONCLUSION: Beautiful resort. Gorgeous beach. 3-star rooms. Would hesitate to stay here again due to below-average dining.

<Content>Great Time at the Majestic Just returned with a group of 18 and a wonderful time was had by all! Don't listen to the negative reviews, those are just people that don't know how to have a good time and just like to have something to complain about.I've recently stayed at the Iberostar Punta Cana, Iberostar in Playa del Carmen, and the RIU in Cancun for reference. This hotel ranks very high in comparison.We met the famous Richard upon check in and he personally helped us make our dinner reservations. All of the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Service with a smile was the standard, especially the guy who makes the crepes during the breakfast buffet.I'm not going to repeat what most others have said in full detail, but all in all you get beautiful rooms, outstanding grounds, wonderful service, clean sandy beach, and a huge assortment of food for a very reasonable price. Speaking of the food, it's really nice that only 2 of the restaurants require reservations and in comparison to the food at the Iberostar Punta Cana it was of much higher quality. I also want to note that no one in our group of 18 got sick. Also, the entertainment team constantly had something going on. Games at the pool and beach all day, the band that played every night, the show in the theatre in the super comfortable chairs, and then on to the casino or nightclub afterwards. There is always something to do.I've never gone to the same resort twice, but this one may just have to have a 2nd visit!

<Content>Good on Somethings Bad on Others Upon arriving they greet you with cookies and drinks, along with a heated towel. Check in went smoothly. We had a quad and the room and bathroom were amazing. The grounds on the hotel are immaculate. We were there for a 30th Bday and taking pics along the beach was beautiful. The Bartenders were really great catering to your every need. The best place for drinks are the lobby. They have a small casino and club which were nice as well. This is the Good Now time for the Ugly.Food which is really important to me was subpar. The best place for food is their lobster and steak restaurant. Excellent. But you have to go to different restaurants for the experience. So one nite I ate at one and directly across in the same restaurant you have to cross over to enjoy the other. Very wierd.Also the restaraunt on the beach you are constantly competing with flies. The food is not fresh and is just sitting under heating lamps. Breakfast is definately your best bet. Top of the line.Also a couple that was there friends of ours had mold growing in their room. They spoke with the front desk and their room was never changed. The smell was horrible. I can't even believed they put up with it. At the end of their 4 day stay the hotel offered to compensate them with free room service on their next visit. What a joke.Also be careful with making calls with a calling card. I purchased a calling card from thier gift shop and was told it was no charge from the room. Wrong info. So when I got a bill for these calls at check out what a suprise. I explained to the barley speaking english mgr what had happened with my roomate who was their when I made my purchase what was relyaed and they were unrelenting. I finally came to an agreement which was fare but not after asking to a supervisor. What a waste of a 1/2 hour.All in all there were more positives then negatives.

<Content>Highly Recommended From Toronto, Canada.I stayed at the Majestic 4/19 - 4/26. I went with 6 other family members - my parents who are in their 70/80s, my brother with his wife and 2 girls, and me on my own in my 30s and we all loved it.The hotel itself was great. Very well kept, clean, nicely appointed. Very nice rooms that were spacious and comfortable. The cleaning staff was great and whenever I left a note for something it was done right away.Staff were super. Right from check-in with the person at the front desk being very friendly and the bell boy was nice. The waiters/waitresses in the restaurants - esp. buffet were superb. Marisol and Maribel were great and spoiled my elder parents always calling out momma  pappa!!!. At the pool bar, you must go by and see Victor as he is a blast and once again treated my parents with great attention and care.The animation team was great. I don't know where Francisco got his energy from but every day, twice a day he led aerobics on the beach with a smile and we all enjoyed it - especially the men that would sit back and watch it from their lounge chairs :) This team worked such long days - from morning to midnight in the disco showing everyone certain dances and dancing merengue with the clientele. Go to the gym and see Martires who was always there to help and will bring you a towel if he sees you breaking out into a sweat as I did. He will also be at the disco and dance merengue too!The food was perfectly good so I really don't what people complain about.The beach was gorgeous. I went scuba diving, parasailing, banana boating and had a massage on the beach. I enjoyed all of these extras.I would certainly return. Contact me with any questions:smith_glenna@hotmail.com

<Content>"Smile Awhile" My husband and I just returned from 10 nights at the Marvelous Majestic. We wanted to mention a few of the employees who made our stay comfortable and fun. First, Denny the beach consierge kept our cups filled with yummy island drinks including Presidente. Then there was the sun blonde and tanned Marciella with her energetic aerobics on the beach. Our meals in the formal dining room were pleasant because of Benito and Mercedes and all of the other servers. They always had time to ask if we needed anything. Our maid took great care of our swim-up room with private jacuzi indoor and outdoor on our patio. The food was fresh and well-cooked and seasoned. We swam in the almost calm sea and walked on the long beaches every day. The pool was unique with it's winding river appearance. The employees had smiles and hugs for us when we left. Anyone who doesn't have a good time at this resort won't have a good time anywhere. We WILL return when we get a chance and hope to see our island friends again. Vineland, New Jersey.

<Content>Team Animation made my trip! I just got back yesterday from staying at the Majestic Tuesday to Tuesday. My experience was amazing, Team Animation made my trip. Walter felt like a brother to me and I was beginning to get tears the day I was leaving. I hope he never forgets our hand shake! Tony was awesome. always getting me and my friend involved and he took the time to hangout with us. Ray was crazy, he had so much energy and from what I saw and my mom said, the best dancer she had ever danced with. I will never forget my experience and I wish there could be someway to see my amigos again. Walter I love you brother!  Shaw

<Content>Great holiday Five couples including ourselves stayed at the Majestic from April 13-20.We had a wonderful time, my only complaint was the house keeping staff...on a few days we did not get any toilet paper, along with face cloths and towels on another, however the rooms were very clean, the mini fridge was restocked everyday!The grounds are beautiful and well manicrued, it was amazing to watch the gardners work , everything was perfect when they were finished.The pool is wonderful, a little warm by the end of the day however we did go in April and it was really hot most days!We found the food good, we stayed for one week and had great food every night..our favourite would have been either the mexican or the Japaness, however we did eat at the beach 3 times, and the steak was amazing! We had breakfast at the buffet and also the beach, great omelets ! We found it easier to head to the beach for breakfast because it opened at 10:30 am so we could sleep in if we wanted to!The shows were great, but we missed Michael Jackson because it is on Sunday night, Sunday was our arrival and departure day .Overall we had a wonderful time, very relaxing, a note to others...with all the marble and pressed concrete it can be very slippery when these are wet..so be careful when walking with wet feet...Oh and P.S.take some bendable straws along with a pool mattress to float on..and you will really enjoy your stay!

<Content>Fantastic All Inclusive!! The Majestic Colonial was a fantastic all inclusive resort. We have stayed at all inclusives in Jamaica and Mexico and the Majestic Colonial was the best by far.The rooms were spacious and very clean with friendly maid service. The shower was amazing. Large enough for two with separate foot sprayer.The food at the buffet was very good. There was always enough for even picky eaters in our group. Not long waits in the lines The restaurants were very good, too. The Japanese restaurant was a special treat for our last evening.The pool was AMAZING!!! So beautiful with enough chairs for it not to feel crowded. Plenty of shade.Same for the beach!! Enough chairs  plenty of shade.DENNY the beach consierge was GREAT! Our group of twenty never went thirsty with DENNY around. He did a great job and made the beach even better.Everything close to golf.We would definitely go back or recommend to our friends

<Content>Resort was beautiful but thats where it ends We just returned from a 5 day stay at the Majestic, glad it wasn't our usual 7 day stay I was ready to come home by the 4th night.The property itself is gorgeus and the staff very friendly the rooms clean (but the bed horrific, asked for a mattress topper but it never appeared) and the water and pool beautiful. It was my first time at an ai and that may sway me to never try one again.I should always follow my motto of you get what you pay for. The house wines were awful and I never tasted such a horrible margarita in my life. I can't beleive people actually thought the food was edible. Breakfast was the best and safest meal but that only goes so far. If we were not there with a great group of people (very large group) we definitely would not have enjoyed the time there as much as we did. I did not get sick but did not eat salad and brushed my teeth with bottled water and took pepto 3 days before and the whole time there. Sadly friends that were leaving with us had to take their teenager to the hospital and did not return till 3 days later. And majestic colonial had no rooms available and made no effort to help them so they slept at the hospital for 2 nights. My husband survived the time there but has been sick since he has been home. Too much of a crap shoot for me to ever go back.

<Content>Wonderful family resort We had a wonderful time at this all-inclusive resort and would gladly go back. We booked two junior suites, garden view which are the least expensive rooms. We paid $2982 for 7 nights for the two rooms, all meals for the four of us, open bar, and entertainment. The food was ample, delicious and offered sufficient variety that we weren't tired of the selections even after a week. They do say that there is a dress code, especially for the fanciest restaurant at night (which wants men in shirts with a collar and no sandals). As long as you have a shirt and sandals, you are usually fine. Our son got told to change his shirt one evening when he was wearing a skimpy sleeveless shirt. The restaurant farthest from the beach did not serve you in wet bathing suits but the one by the beach would.The rooms were spacious and even had a large jacuzzi tub in the room. The only weird thing is that the bathroom is not physically separated from the bedroom/living area.Hints:- If you want chaise lounge chairs on the beach but under the shade, send a person down to the beach well before 8AM to stake our your claim. You can always move the chair into the sun. It makes a nice time of day to take a brisk walk on the beach before going to the breakfast buffet.- Take advantage of the activities. My two teenaged boys found that they enjoyed both the stretching and aerobics class on the beach in the morning. They both won small bottles of rum (well, I picked up their prize) in games.- Kayaking was easier in the morning before the afternoon wind picked up.- Bring US dollars. You need $10/person for your entry visa and they prefer dollars for any extra purchases (souvenirs, outside trips such as snorkling). Many of the guests were tipping the bartenders but we got good service even though we hadn't brought much cash.- See if you can book your transportation to the resort ahead of time - there was not a queue of taxis waiting to take you to your resort. We found a company that handled Expedia customers and they charged $20/person for the roundtrip transportation (another request for US dollars).- Bring lots of sunblock - it is very expensive to buy there.- There is paying internet access at $5/hour.- There were some bugs that could leave some nasty bites - we only seemed to encounter them at dusk when we sat out on our balcony. Bug spray is good to bring but the bugs still liked my husband.- The evening shows are pretty well done - don't miss the circus program as there are some good aerial acrobats.- If you want a raft, noodle or innertube for floating in the pool or ocean, bring one from home as they are expensive there and there aren't any available at the pool.Definitely a place to enjoy!

<Content>A Majestic Attempt Well, we are back from our week at the Majestic Colonial (April 18-25). As some regulars are aware, I went with a group of 36 that included Beachbrat and Beachbudwizer. Based upon some of the reviews I had read in the last few months, I would have to question those who only give the MC a one or two star rating. Was the trip perfect? Nope, but then again, what is. Overall a very fun trip. This review will be a bit long as I plan on breaking down (and ranking) items separately. I also have some miscellaneous items that Ill talk about at the end.Flight to Punta Cana 鈥?Flew on USAirways out of Boston鈥?Logan airport. Parked fine at the terminal. Had done the pre-checkin from home so getting our bags checked went pretty quick. No issues thru security. Flight took off on time. Had a connecting flight in Philadelphia. This is where it got a bit interesting. Flight was overbooked. It took USAirways offering 2 tickets per person to ANYWHERE they flew, no restircitions, for people to start volunteering. 2 in our group decided to do it. Flight to Punta Cana was uneventful. 5/5Arrival in Punta Cana 鈥?br/>Arrived in warmth and sunshine. Very quick pass thru immigration. Paid our $10 entry fee. Baggage came out quickly. Out to the parking area to find our transportation to MC. Small bit of confusion ensued. Because of the size of our group they had to get another bus. After about a 陆 hour we got on and were on our way. Now, here鈥檚 a fun tidbit. I live and drive in the Boston area. My job sometimes requires me to drive to NY. I thought I had seen crazy drivers. NOTHING compared to DR drivers. Buses passed buses on a two lane 鈥渉ighway鈥? Noone following traffic signs. Bit of a white knuckle ride. But made it to MC fine. 3/5Checkin-Arrived to cool towels and Majestic drinks (youngest loved these, drank them all week). Got in line with the other arrivies. After standing in line for 20 mins and getting to the front, found out that we had to checkin at a 鈥渟pecial鈥?TNT station across the lobby. Of course, ended up in the back of the line at that one. Finally got keys to room after an hour. Was a bit annoyed that there were no signs indicating that TNT guest checkin at different location. Did get room on floor in building we requested (3136). 3/5Room 鈥?br/>Huge. We had a king size bed and had them bring in two twins for our boys. Now the only drawback is that these are regular beds, not rollaways. So we couldn鈥檛 fold them up during the day. However, the rooms were so large that it was never an issue. No musty smells. No bugs. Limited places to put clothing though. No dresser, just shelves in a closet and 2 nitestands. Not a problem. Shower is large. Not a big deal with the toilet arrangement but it was a bit of an issue when I got sick a few days later (more on that). Also, would have been nice to have more places to hang towels, bathing suits, etc. 4/5Resort-MC鈥檚 biggest strength. This resort is absolutely beautiful. Very nicely laid out. As stated earlier, lobby is very nice. Both lobby bars (where you can get the best booze) are extremely nice. 5/5Beach/Pool-2nd biggest strength. Beach was sandy, water inviting (although surprisingly a bit cool). Pool was amazing, my youngest loved it. Usually had no issues with chairs and palayas (except for a few times, more later). 5/5Food-Average overall. Good in some spots (Steak house), average in some (buffet, Mexican), below average in others (Chinese- a group we where there with walked out without eating). Never got to Japanese (highly rated by those in our group that did) or Gourmet (hit or miss 鈥?one group that went walked out after not being served even their apps 45 mins into the meal, another group thought it was great). Now, as mentioned earlier, I got a touch of 鈥渟omething鈥?that pretty much made it impossible for me to eat or drink after the 3rd day. Luckily my niece who was with us is a nurse had brought cipiro (sp?) and after taking that I got back to normal about a day later. But I will say, I was pretty tired of eggs by the time I left (飦?although breakfast is very good). 3/5Service 鈥?br/>Good overall. Our room service was kinda hit or miss (they would make the beds, etc, but not leave towels). Left tips most days. Bars where usually very good, tried to tip accordingly. Tried mamajuna- was perhaps the most disgusting drink I ever had. But it got better by the third one鈥?飦?(j/k). Gave out RedSox hats to the gardeners, security guards, etc. they all were appreciative. 4/5Activities-Didn鈥檛 do many as they appeared to be more geared to the 20-30yr old crowd (who looked like they were having fun). My youngest tried to get involved in one of the chair games, but again, to many 鈥渂ig kids鈥? We did do speedboats (lots of fun $70 for an hour with 2 of us), ATV (oldest did that, was a horror show, breakdowns, etc, ended up only getting about 20mins of ride time for a 4 hour excursion, $70), Banana boat ride (fun) and tube ride (really fun, but whipped my body around something fierce). So if you paid for an activity it was fun, but onsite freebies were lacking a bit. I would like to have had more 鈥渇amily鈥?oriented activities, and to be honest its one of the reasons I wouldn鈥檛 go back to MC (well, I would with just the wife and I , but not with kids). Others in my group concurred. 3/5Return Flight 鈥?br/>We were supposed to leave the resort at 1pm for a 4:30pm flight. I couldn鈥檛 for the life of me figure out why we need that much time. Well, we needed every minute (and more). Van was a 陆 hour late getting us. We then went to two other resorts on the way to the airport, but never picked up any more passengers. Getting out Punta Cana is a nitemare. You go thru one line to check your luggage (after airport security goes thru it). You then go thru the immigration line. You then go thru the passport check line. Then thru carry one check line. Each line stretched out forever. At 3:30pm, when we were about 陆 way thru the Passport check line, they called FINAL BOARDING FOR OUR 4:30pm FLIGHT.! This was the first time they had called it. Mayhem ensued. We ended up getting rushed thru both passport and carryon checkins. Crazy. Flights were ok, you have to recheck your bags once you get to the US. Logan did its usual wonderful job of having us hang around for 45mns to get our luggage off the plane. 2/5Miscellaneous-We had a couple issues with the towel game. Twice we came out to spots we had reserved (within an 11/2 hours) to find that someone had moved our towels and taken over. Hey, I can live with that. What I had a problem with was the couple that came onto the beach and took the two chairs in THE MIDDLE of a row of six I had saved. When I questioned them they basically told me that they didn鈥檛 see any towels (although they had to move two of my towels to take the chairs.). the best part was when they went to go to lunch they put towels down and folded the chairs forward TO SAVE THEM WHILE THEY WENT TO LUNCH!. It was to laugh鈥? Towel Game 3/5We also had photos taken by the resort photographer, who did an excellent job. We ended up buying about 40 of the pictures (don鈥檛 ask how much鈥?飦?). But we were very happy with the results. 5/5Overall, it was a fun trip, but not one I would make again (especially with so many choices out there). But I did think that the pros outweighed the cons and gave the whole trip 4 stars. Let me know if you have any questions.OFTRD

<Content>Loved It! Second Time here. Last year just me and my husband went. This year brought the kids and our friends and their kids, 21 in total. Had a great time!! Nothing to complain about, rooms were clean, food was wonderful, beach white and sandy and very clean pool We all had a wonderful time. THe kids had a ball doing all the activities with Maria, she was great with the kids, playing games and taking them to the field to play baseball and soccer, etc. At night the kids would hang at the outdoor game area where they played pool, ping pong, lifesize chess and checkers. All the entertainment was fantastic and special thanks to the animation guys, especially Ray, Walter and Tony and all the rest, we had a blast with them playing all the games and learning the dances. Can't wait to go back.

<Content>Life Doesn't Get Any Better Than This!!! What can we say? This resort is gorgeous! We just returned from the Majestic after a week in paradise... we got married there and travelled with 15 other guests. Everything was perfect and we couldn't have asked for anything more special. This hotel really makes you feel special in every way... the workers are definitely people-pleasers and do everything to make you smile :)All of the restaurants were exceptional... the chateaubriand was fabulous at the Rodeo Grill, and the Teppanyaki Japanese cooking presentation was lots of fun! The resort itself is spotless and the beach is the most beautiful on the strip. Can't wait to return to the Majestic Elegance!Important! Do NOT believe the negative reviews about this resort. Life just doesn't get any better than this!

<Content>Thumbs up for the anamation team Their were Twenty-one of us from New Jersey who stayed at the Majestc frorm4/19-4/26. We had the best time there. We found a area by the pool near the swim up bar and stayed in that spot all week. We were entertained by the animation team. I never palyed so many games in my life. We would like to thank Ray, Walter (Spaghetti), Tony , Maria and the rest of the team for doing such a wonderful job.If you can't have fun at this resort then you just don't know how to have a good time with fun people.I will never forget my week at the Majestic.

<Content>Awesome Vacation Overall, we had a great experience staying at the Majestic Colonial!! The resort itself was beautiful. We found the staff to be very friendly, and were pleasantly surprised to find that they spoke pretty good English. The rooms were even better and larger than we had expected, and this was one of the cleanest reorts we have been to. We had excellent service from a gentleman by the name of Denny on the beach. He was always around to make sure our needs were met. The beach was also very clean and beautiful. If I had any complaints at all, I would have to say that it was a bit noisy in the wee hours of the morning. Lots of young people there at this particular time, and I guess they don't require any sleep at night; but I do, so we found that a little frustrating. We would also recommend that the hotel put rubber wheels on the cleaning carts as they have tile walkways, and with plastic wheels, they tend to be a bit noisy when rolling down the hall. As far as the food goes, FANTASTIC!!! We especially liked the Tempanyaki, but I can honestly say that all the restaurants were great, and gave exceptional service. This was truely a wonderful vacation..

<Content>Just returned from Majestic have just returned from (a somewhat rainy) week at the majestic colonial. I researched on trip advisor for a long time before booking at majestic. i have stayed at other ai's in punta cana and mexico as well. i will try and give as unbiased opinion as possible.Hotel and grounds- just beautiful. we stayed in standard suite. As another post stated, never saw ANYONE use their outdoor hot tubs. doesn't seem worth the upgrade. the beds were 4 poster, nice tile floors, deck with 2 chairs (ours faced garden, nice and quiet. We especially liked the fact that you could go from one end of the resort to the other without getting wet as all buildings are covered with overhangs.decor in restaurants was nothing to write home about.Maid service- nothing special. we had to call every day for extra towels. after the first day, we never got extra yellow towels for the jacuzzi tubs in our room. Cleaning was very good, however.Bars- bartenders were very friendly, and a buck tip will get you alot of extra liquor. unlike the grand bahia principe, you can get drinks in the restaurants.Bartenders were very friendly, always smiling. Majestic Drink was awesome.Restaurant service- waiters were not too friendly. Fortunately, all they did was take your order, then you never saw them again. the rest of the staff was very friendly, helpful, and always looking out for you. Pool- looked like a meandering lazy river. Clean, clean, clean. Never crowded, although the hotel was fully booked. Ocean had alot of seaweed. If you walked about 10 minutes away from hotel, no seaweed, very strange.Spa- had 2 scalp and shoulder messages. much more relaxing and got rid of more kinks than regular massage. Claoudia (sp) did a great job both times. Well worth the money.Now the most disappointing part (for me) the food. I do not go to all inclusives expecting gourmet food. However, of all the hotels i have been to, i have to say, i was the most disappointed in this food. My favorite meal was breakfast. The cook making the crepes was amazing! There were only a few signs indicating what the food was at lunch and dinner at the buffet. The gourmet restaurant offered only 4 choices. We walked out of the chinese restaurant after only 1 bite of our food. And who uses cereal as toppings for ice cream??!!!It got to the point that the food choices were boring because there wasn't that much that was good (and we are not food snobs- food at iberostar mayan in mexico was much better!)The bernaise sauce at the steak house did not even have tarragon in it, so it was rather bland! The 2 outdoor restaurants, fish and steak had a circus quality to them, and i could imagine them being quite hot in the summer.The Michael Jackson show was terrific...the others, eh,,. A band played outside on the terrace before the show for dancing, which was quite nice, dancing under the stars.In conclusion, did we have a good time? Yes, would we go there again? No, not unless they completely overhauled their food (or served breakfast all day!)

<Content>great resort if you like to relax and hang on the beach or at the pool I just returned from a week vacation at the Majestic Colonial Resort. We were a party of 12- celebrating my parents 50th wedding anniversary. We had a very relaxing vacation- The resort is beautiful- the pool is magnificent- One of the largest pools in the caribbean.I have read a number of conflicting reviews of this resort- and thought I would share my experience. If you are used to a deluxe resort with gourmet food and upscale accomodations- avoid the Dominican Republic. If however you enjoy relaxing at a great pool, drinking your blender drinks and hanging out with your friends and family, this is a wonderful resort.The facilities are beautiful and clean, the staff friendly and efficient, the pool and beach are beautiful.The only negative point is the rooms themselves. It is a weird set up if you are travelling with children. The jacuzzi tub and bathroom facilties are open to the room itself. There is nowhere to change your clothes in privacy and going to the bathroom is not a private event. If you are the type of person who needs privacy- this is not the resort for you. I was in a room with my 15 year old son, and my 12 year old daughter- so we had to be creative when it came time to get dressed- we managed to work it out, but you should be aware of this fact before you go, so you arent surprised.As far as food- Again, if you are looking for gourmet food- avoid the DR altogether. The food here is plentiful- lots of choices- You wont go hungry- But nothing was outstanding- The best restaurants were the japanese and the seafood. Everything else is ok- Overall I would say, this is a great resort if you know what to expect. It was a great relaxing vacation, and that was exactly what we were looking for.Hope this helped!

<Content>All Inclusive Resort Convert My husband and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial for a friend's wedding. The resort is absolutely gorgeous and our stay was wonderful. I was worried before we went that the food wouldn't be good or that the drinks would be weak. I was totally proven wrong. The whole experience was perfect. I had booked the reservation several months in advance and requested a room upgrade. We ended up with a great room right on the beach with an amazing view. I highly recommend the resort.

<Content>more than what we expected.............April 25 2008 Just got back last night on april 25 from majestic and was missing it already. Let me start by saying that this is the most beautiful resort in all of punta cana. The grounds are gorgous with lots of flowers and lush greens anywhere u looked. The rooms were very nicely layed out with rose petels and towel animals everyday. The food was very good lots to chose from. I really cant say nothing bad about our experience there. If u are plnning a trip to majestic colonial go for it . You wont be disappointed with the amazing time u will have. Everybody is so nice and the service was incrediable. Dont forget to tip it goes a long way for the workers. They will do anything u ask i promise! [--] email for any uestions u have will answer for u!

<Content>Had a great time! After reading all of the negative things about this resort, we were concerned. We just returned from five wonderful days there. As with any resort everything is not going to be perfect. We found the food to be delicious. There were many choices at the buffet and you can always find something you like. We read complaints about the drinks but were pleasantly surprised. If you want a specially prepared cocktail, visit the bars in the lobby. The bartenders there will prepare anything you want with a flourish. The service offered by all of the employees was excellent. We especially enjoyed our interactions with Denny, the beach concierge. Every day he served us with a smile and a positive attitude. Our one issue was finding chairs at the beach with shade. If you did not arrive at the beach by 7:30, there was not an open hut. Guests reserved their place early and often were not at the chairs for hours. There were some structural issues around the resort such as broken cement at the pool and bathrooms that needed some work. The grounds are beautiful and the staff works hard to keep it clean and well maintained.We have stayed at two other resorts in Punta Cana and would say that this is among the top resorts.

<Content>Loved the Majestic My family of five just returned from a week stay at the Majestic resort. We have stayed in several all-inclusive resorts in Punta Cana and Mexico and this was by far our favorite.The general manager, Jose Maria and his staff run a fine operation. The workers are friendly and effecient.The rooms the pool and the grounds are immaculate. The pool is huge and the beach is beautiful. Chairs are plentiful at each.The food was great. There was so much to choose from. We really enjoyed the steak, seafood , Japanese and Dominican restaurants. It was nice that you have to make reservations in only two of the restaurants. My kids loved the buffets.My daughter went on the Bavarro Runners excursion. She had a great time. She loved the tour guide Carlos. The VIP rep, Jama, was great. Very helpful and informative about the hotel and island.Overall, we had a wonderful vacation at the Majestic and would highly recommend it. We hope to return next year.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation A group of five families spent a week at the Majestic. From the time we arrived until we left we received wonderful service. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The selection of restaurants was impressive and all had fantastic selections to choose from. There was always somewhere to go when you were hungry. The beach area was clean and very nicely set up but be sure to select your area early in the morning.....most mornings we got down there by 7am to reserve our chairs. Denny, the beach concierge made sure we kept ourselves hydrated with drinks while on the beach; in the afternoons we moved to the pool area to cool off before dinner. With 10 children in our group ranging in ages from 12 - 18 we never worried about their safety. We did bring along walkie-talkies....and soon found out that many other families did the same as we heard many conversations. But all in all, it was good. Without a doubt it was a sad moment when we left the resort to come home. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the Dominican Republic and the Majestic Colonial Resort and would recommend this to anyone from families to couples.

<Content>Tainted Love The resort layout itself is very nice. I don't know if it was the spring break in spain or what but at night they had a night club that was open untill 4am and kids were yelling up and down the hallways almost every night on the hour. Keep in mind the food here is beyond bland; So we decided lets try out the mexican food resteraunt... (don't eat the soup). 3 out of 4 of us had stuff coming out of both ends, and were in bed for the rest of our trip with mild fevers. The drinks are very poor as well. Nothing is really made, all drinks have pre mixes and they can't even get that close to a magarita. On the positive, beer is better than mexicos staple for tourist. The other bad thing is we could not even relax on the beach. They have some dude enternaing kids and adults at the top of his lungs over a speaker system, so you never got that wind, wave, beach relax. Also, the food is mediocre at best. If you have been to a all inclusive resort before, you will be disappointed with this one!!!! Dreams of Tulum is 8 out of 10, this is more like 4 out of 10. This resort just did not do a good job entertaining kids, and using there facilities to a better potential. 4 out of 10 Blahhh

<Content>Loved the Majestic We had a wonderful time at the Majestic Colonial. Most of the staff was friendly and helpful, especially Francisco and Tony who had just started at the resort that week. The food was good, you could find something you liked at the different restaurants or the buffet. The entertainment was very good at night. The bars were plentiful andabundant. After spending a week there the staff really does recognize and acknowledge you. We had a poolside room, which was very spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable. I would return to this resort in the future and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>My favorite hotel We just returned from the Domincan Republic. We stayed at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana. My husband and I were there last year this time and loved it so much we returned with our daughter who is 8. We travel to the Caribbean often and we love the Domincan Republic. The Majestic is only a couple of years old so it is very clean. They all aim to please you. They have a great crew a people there to make sure you have whatever it is you need. One of my favorite gals is Anyela Calderon. She remebered us from last year. She works at guest services. When she saw us she was so happy! I didn't think she would remeber us but she did. We had our bed turned down every night with rose petals on it. We had a special delivery everyday to our room. Such as cheese and fruit tray one day. Then we had a bottle of wine with sushi etc etc. The beach is one of the most magnificent beaches we have ever been to. We have been to Jamicia, Mexico, and St. Lucia many times at different resorts and this place has it all! The pool is wonderful as well. There are quite places to go or if you want to mingle with others there is that as well. The food is good. My husband is a steak lover so they have really good steaks. Me, I'm a pasta person there are all pasta stations with all kinds of sauces for it. Well all I can say is that we are getting ready to book our vacation back there asap. We love it!!!!!

<Content>Perfect Vaction We have recently come back from Punta Cana, and we stayed at Majestic and I would recommend it to anyone! We thought the service was excellent, food was great, the workers were very friendly and went out of their way to please you, the hotel was spotless, and I can honestly say that I could not say one bad thing about my experience, and I would definently go back again. We traveled down there with a group of 25 and not one person could say anything bad about their experience either. We would expically like to give a hands up to Rey, Walter,and Victor(at the pool bar). Along with everything else the entertainment was great. Overall we can honestly say that we can rate our vacation a complete 5 out of 5.

<Content>Beautiful Resort, Nice People We travelled from London Ontario to the Majestic April 11th to the 18th 2008. Upon arrival we were quickly taken care of  given a drink.We got there at noon but only had to wait an hour for our room, eating lunch while we waited. The food is good, but gets a bit repetitious after a few days. We found the best restaurant to eat in was the french restaurant. The food is great  atmosphere is very relaxing, eating by candlelight. The pool is awesome  you never have a problem finding chairs. It goes the whole length of the resort. The beach was also very nice  clean.Would recommend this resort!

<Content>Had a great holiday Let me start by saying that neither my wife of I can understand why any one would give this hotel a bad review!The resort is excellent; the food is great there's a lot of choice and anyone who says different is being really picky. With 6 restaurants to choose from there is plenty of choice, we ate in all the restaurants expect the Mexican and the gourmet. The grill house did an excellent steak, the sea food restaurant was good as well as the Japanese and Chinese and the main buffet was excellent plenty of variety and catered well for kids.We did not suffer from the infamous dodgy stomach and we ate in all the restaurants. A word of warning do not drink the tap water and use bottled water to brush your teach. Another tip our rep gave us was to limit your self to only two pina coladas a day - apparently the oil from the coconut used to make this can cause an upset stomach if your are not used to this.Anyway we think the reason for people getting an upset stomach is more to do with the drink and over eating than the food itself.We thought the service was good - people were attentive even when really busy and $1 tip helped ensure you received a good service. (Remember this is a developing country and people work hard for these tips)Our only complaint would be that there was no drinks menu - not a major issue as we still got some good cocktails and never had to wait more than a few minutes for our drinks.As for the accommodation the room was excellent, we were initially given a twin room (two double beds) even thou we had requested a king - we were moved as soon as a room become available.The pool was amazing as was the beach - always plenty sun loungers no matter what time you go - so need to get up early and put your towels down.All in all an excellent and relaxing holiday - anyone that has issues with this place is expecting to much - you might not be able to call this a 5 star but it definitly great value for money.Anyway we think the reason for people getting an upset stomach is more to do with the drink and over eating than the food itself.We thought the service was good - people were attentive even when really busy and $1 tip helped ensure you recieved a good service.

<Content>5 star all the way We went for a wedding for a week. I have been away to about 15 all inclusives, and was a bit hesitant at the price. You certainly get what you pay for. 5 star all the way. If you complain about this place, you either had bad luck, or you can find something wrong with anything.Clean, clean clean. Friendly beyond belief. The rooms are fantastic, and the view amazing. The wedding went perfectly. What more can I say. This is more of a romantic get away than a place for children, although there are things to do for children. There are no caesars though, for those of you from Canada. Only Bloody Mary's. Jacuzzi in your room or on the balcony.

<Content>Resort good, food bad. Majestic Colonial.We chose this hotel because it was the # 2 on trip advisor and we usually trust the rating and comments on this website.We were scared to go after reading all kinds of reviews about this hotel on trip advisorMy husband and I traveled in many different countries in all kinds of hotel ratings, as an ex travel agent I also been too many All-inclusive for work in the past and have a good idea of the quality/price for that type of hotel.The Hotel is very nice and not too crowded, beautiful swimming pool area and on a nice beach.I really appreciate the fact that you don鈥檛 have to wake up too early to have a chair on the beach or around the pool, there is plenty of space for everyone at any time of the day compare to many all inclusive places where after breakfast no one is sitting on chairs but all of them have towel or personal items to reserve the place.We booked a standard room and made a special request for a room on the building 2 far from the constructions well in advance of arrival, facing the swimming pool. We got exactly what we requested. The real problem of this hotel is: THE FOODBy the way you can make one reservation only per specialty restaurant per week.The Mexican restaurant was really bad. We were really disappointed. We saw some people order food and leave 5 minutes later because they couldn鈥檛 eat the food. Special Japanese restaurant it鈥檚 simply a stir-fry really no big deal but was fine. The other Asian was really just average.The Gourmet is a joke; they have the d茅cor to make it look like classy with a sommelier etc. Don鈥檛 get fooled by that. It鈥檚 the quality of an okay wedding dinner or an average cruise ship meal. They also ran out of more than the half of the menu at 8:30pm Our favorite was the Steakhouse restaurant, excellent steak and better than the Gourmet.The buffets indoor and outdoor were just ok and half of the dishes were generally always cold and about half looked like they were dry and needed replacing, about 25% of the dishes were both warm and did not look like they were sitting there for hours. The best is the made to order food but there may be a wait.Almost everybody was complaining about the food in the resort during the time we were there. The quality of drinks was not constant sometimes you had a great cocktail and another time it was absolutely disgusting. I thought the sizes of the cocktails were fine but most people were walking with their thermos and complaining how small the drinks were.We really don't care for the Dominican Republic, but the facilities itself were on par or better than the other hotels we say up and down the beach.Keep in mind the Resort is 4 stars but the food is really a 2 陆 to 3 stars and you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Counting down the days til next year We have just returned from our first trip to the Dominicain. There were seven of us in total and ages range from nine to fifty-five. This was in celebration of our wedding. We trIed to book a wedding at the resort but no times were available. So a small wedding at home turned out to be for the best. The resort was beautiful, rooms were just like the pictures. The pool was what sold us to start. We brought floating tubes and our bubba kegs, it was like floating in a lazy river. The ocean had red and black flags up, so there was to much undertow for the kids to enjoy the beach. Not sure if that is the way it always is. Sand was nice and white but the beach in cayo coco, cuba was much more enjoyable. Food was great but if your not booked in for your reservations when you get there forget it. We landed late so waited to book and nothing was available. With a complaint to Sighnature rep. he could only swing two out of our seven, so my husband and i went to japanese. That was by far the best meal we had there. We sat around the grill. We found out through other travellers that you can go to the japanese rest. and sit on the rest. side without reservations, they don't tell you this. Buffet was the best place to have our meals, with kids there were fries through to your seafood. Shows were great.  Our air conditioner broke twice when we were there, it flooded the floor and 5am the first time, i mean a flood. They were quick to come fix it. Our kids had great time, already bugging to come next year.  We did do some excursions while down there. The Outback Safari, Dune Buggies, Happy Hour and parasailing. The out back safari takes you to the jungle but also through town, which allows the kids to see how other children live and they really won't die if they don't have their Xbox. The cost on that one was $89 per person. The Dune buggies, started out as horse back riding, to a cave that was filled with fresh water. We jumped in for a swim, that was amazing. The we meet up with the rest of the group to take the dune buggies. You follow a trail and they really don,t allow you to get up any speed. But the children enjoyed it, they allowed my fourteen year old son to drive. The clothes you wear for that ride, you better just throw out, you drive on the same track as the horses! The cost on that was $130 for two in a buggie. Happy Hour was a half day catamuran, snorkleing, and a floating bar on the natural pool while the sun goes down. That was the best bang for the buck 3:30-8:00 and it was $69 pp.. Parasailling was offered at the beach $45 single $80 double. One last thing you might want to know we flew Skyservice and paid the $30 pp to pre book seats and that didn't matter we ended up having to argue to not have our children sitting by themselves. A couple our families had the same problem on this flight. One lady had a three year old sitting on her own, the little one was not impressed. All in all i will go back, coming from Canada and we get to much snow. If your comparing Punta Cana to Cuba. Food is better in Dominicain, resorts are newer, but the beaches are nicer on cayo coco. Also the photograghers on site do a great job, there is no fee for the session but you have to at least purchase ten pictures ranging from $10 to $30 each. So cheapest package $100.THEY ONLY TAKE CASH, If you want a bigger package be preared.

<Content>Fantastic!! This is a quick review. The Majestic Colonial is awesome. There is nothing to worry about here at all 鈥?well, I didn鈥檛 like the toilet stall. It wasn鈥檛 for lack of privacy but just the size of it. The room was great. It was usually cleaned early, restocked with fresh towels. Service was fantastic at all of the restaurants. They were on top of everything. Everyone was friendly. The animation team was awesome 鈥?thank you to Evelisse, Francisco and Maciel for an entertaining time. There was never a wait at the bars. Had my first real massage. It was just perfect. I don鈥檛 know why I worried about the other reviews. This place is number one!

<Content>Amazing Trip We just got back from the Majestic yesterday after having spent an amazing week at this incredible resort. We loved every minute of our stay there and were impressed with everything about this resort. We had read some reviews before going and had some concerns. These quickly disappeared once we arrived. Transport from the hotel was quick and efficient and once we got there check in was quick and easy. Not only did we get a drink as we arrived but a cold towel to cool off. Our room was not ready but there were courtesy showers and an area to leave our luggage. So we were able to hit the buffet and beach in no time. Our room was ready shortly and we were very happy once we entered. The king size bed was perfect as was the view form the terrace. We weren't too concerned before arriving as we didn't plan to spend to much time in the room anyways. The beach was phenomenal and the pool was the nicest I've ever seen. We had read a few bad reviews about the food before going but once we hit the buffet and the other restaurants we had a good laugh. The food was terrific! I don't know what some people expect but the buffet was better than most that we've been to around here. If you can't find something you like with seven restaurants and an enormous buffet you must have a personal chef on call. We certainly did not have any problem with the food. For the price of the trip the food and accommodations were exceptional. The other thing we laughed about was the staff, we found them extremely friendly and most did very well in English and French as well as German and probably other languages. People need to realize they are going to another country and if they expect everyone to speak perfect English maybe should stay home. If your concerned about language don't be, we certainly didn't have any trouble. The service there was top notch, the plates were cleaned and drinks filled right away. The staff was always pleasant and friendly and we had a great time visiting with them. Those people that did should maybe learn a few words of Spanish instead of spending their time complaining. As for safety, we went off the resort on to the shops as well as 3 day trips to the country side and did not at any point feel unsafe. I wouldn't go strolling around the towns at night but I wouldn't do that in some areas around here either. People should use common sense. Overall we found the trip, people and Hotel amazing and definitely met and exceeded our expectations.

<Content>A Pleasant Surprise! My husband and I loved our week at the Majestic Colonial. We were there from March 25th - April 2nd. I have to admit that I was really nervous about what we would find once we arrived from the reviews that I read prior to our trip. This was our first time in Punta Cana but our 4th all inclusive vacation. We have vacationed in the Mayan Riviera at the Barcelo Maya, RIU Palace and the Bahia Principe Coba. The beaches and the water in Punta Cana are amazing the people are kind, happy and extremly proud of their country and heritage. The Majestics suites are very nice, and our suite was very clean, we were upgraded because our room was not ready when we arrived because the people before us paid for a late checkout. We waited for about an hour in the lobby which we didn't really mind you have to remember that you are on VACATION and have to take things as they come. In the end we were upgraded to a suite on the ground level with a private garden area facing the ocean with a jaccuzzi on the patio and inside. I am not sure what the suite is called but it had a King size bed, bar, sitting area, etc. The food is not the same quality as what we have had in the Mayan, but we never went hungry and we did not get sick. The main buffet resturant was the best. And we didn't gain 7lbs like we usually do.We did go on the Outback Saffari excursion and we loved every minute of it. Uncle and Sugar Daddy (Leandro) were excellent guides. This trip was very cultural, safe and fun. We also went horseback riding on the beach which we enjoyed very much keeping in mind that the horses are not what you would find at home they are quite small and very skinny. They were well trained though.We are planning to return to Punta Cana again next year and if the price is right again I would return to the Majestic. Although I should mention the beach at the Majestic is not how it looks in the photos...it appears that there is a large point of sand that extends out but in fact it is not there anymore. The beach while we were there had alot of the weeds washed up on it and they were always working to remove it all. I am not sure if the weeds are always there, but apparently the waves had been quite large and powerful to the extent that no one was aloud on the beach for a few days prior to our arrival. We always ended up aways down the beach.Enjoy your time at the Majestic:)

<Content>Great Wedding and Great Trip I was recently married at the Majestic Colonial. There were 29 of us all together for a one weeks stay. We all had an amazing holiday. The staff were wonderful, the hotel is gorgeous and the beach is stunning. The pool stretches the entire length of the resort. There is always room and no stress in finding a spot. The food was good and there was a good selection. I have had better but I was satisfied. One place you can avoid if you are picky with food is the Mexican restaurant. It wasn't the greatest. Rooms were gorgeous although the bed is a bit hard. The rooms were well looked after and our fridge was always stocked. The wedding was flawless and completey stress free. The staff and Aurelio, the wedding coordinator, are professional and helpful. Overall, 29 travellers, children and adults included, thoroughly enjoyed their stay.We would definitely pay the Majestic another visit!!!

<Content>Beautiful resort, but the service and food not so good I want to start off by saying that the resort is beautiful. The service at the resort was not very helpful nor did I find them attentive. The food was not the best. The only good restaurant that I felt was good was the Mexican place. The two restaurants that were reservation only were booked while we were there. Went for five days and four nights with my friends. My friends were not impress with the resort either. Did not see any activities for children and the club at the resort is small. The casino is small and the drinks weren't really that great.Was not impressed at all with Punta Cana. I feel that Punta Cana is over rated, this is my personal feelings. For a five star resort Majestic Colonial really didn't live up to it's ratings. Was really disappointed with my experience there. For a first timer going to Punta Cana and a five star resort, was very disappointed.

<Content>Fantastic beach holiday I was in the Majestic hotel from the 10th to the 18th of April 2008, just me and my 2 two daughters aged 3 and 6 years old.We had a fantastic time.The kids' club has his own pool with slides, they have indoor games for when the sun is too strong. It's open from 10am to 6pm and they can take your child for lunch if you want to, they are very helpful. I especially liked Maria, who was working at the kid's club, she never seemed tired, always happy to see children and even running the kid's disco every night, which was a big entertainment for my girls.In overall, I always found nice staff and even customers to help me out with the girls. Speaking spanish must have helped me getting along with the staff thoughThe food was great, very nice buffet, we had lots of fresh fruits and vegsThe pool is fantasticThe beach marvellous, perfect sea and white sand, nice breeze that makes the heat bearable.The rooms....pfffttt I couldn't ask for moreNice entertainment at eveningsThe only disagrement we had is that they made a mistake while I checked in, and check me out a day before I was supposed to. So it was not very nice coming back from the beach with 2 tired kids to find out that your room key doesn't work anymore, but this was resolved as soon has I advised the reception.Yes, I think I wouldn't mind going back :-)

<Content>Perfect Vacation I'm just coming back from the Majestic and I will be back next year. Here is some details:Site : The site is perfect with a very good landscape installation. The rooms are large, clean and beautiful. Beach : Beach is good and chairs are always available. But shaded places are difficult to get and you have to go early in the morning. For me it was not a problem because I like the sun. The men on the beach (Denny) is really friendly and he serve drinks all day long....that's good for the lazy (...yes I raise my hand). The sand on the beach is fine, the ocean is perfect and there's more quiet place at the boundaries of the site.Food and restaurants : There's several restaurants on the site but I particularly recommend the Japaneses (reserve on your check in).....a great experience. Seafood and gourmet are good too. The buffet in the morning is incredible and you can be confident to everything. Don't worry to be sick, the food is good and clean on this hotel.Services : Everyone are friendly.....except the man on water sports, not unpleasant but not friendly.There's one problem in this hotel: water sports. You cannot take a ride of catamaran because there's is no driver from the hotel. They must correct this aspect. The same thing's for windsurfing....you must have experience. You cannot try it for the first time. Snorkeling kits are a little bit cheap and bring your palm if you want to dive.If you hesitate between Majestic and another....choose the Majestic and enjoy.Good holiday.

<Content>Dont go, your not safe! We went to Punta Cana becuase it was a great value and all the reviews we read on Trip Advisor were amazing. DO NOT GO! The food was HORRIBLE, it was to the point of it not being ediable. My mother chocked on a potato after a midnight snack in one of the cafe's on site and no one helped her. I stood there screaming for help and the serves just stood there as well. Thank god my husband was there b/c he did the himlic on her. We went to the nurse on site and she was no help. She actually told us that my mother needed surgery b/c she still had small amount of food lodged into her lungs!!! They sent an ambulance and took her to the hospital. Once my mother calmed down the food dis-lodged itself but reguardless we still had to pay a $900 american hospital bill when my mother never even saw a doctor. They had bed pans in the middle of the waiting room. It was the worst day of my life and the stay never made up for it. You can never leave the resort b/c your not safe nor do they recomend it. The beach itself was beautiful but the staff service and facility were no where near par.

<Content>Absolutely Gorgeous! My husband and I recently returned from a 4-night stay at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. We've been to several all-inclusive resorts previously, but not in the Dominican Republic. Booking online, one can never be too sure, but we were definitely pleased. The hotel is only two years old and is really stunning. It's practically spotless - someone is cleaning, sweeping, washing every minute of the day. Our room was very nice. Tiled floor, roomy with a sitting area, king bed, jakuzzi and balcony. We liked the location of the room because of the view of the pool area and beach, but it could get a little noisy due to the proximity to the activities. We did have issue with the noise of the staff working their way through the hallways with their carts. The halls are concrete - thus no carpet to lessen the noise. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had some self-imposed challenges like lost luggage, forgotten appointments, etc. They were patient and accommodating. Most of the customer facing staff spoke very good English. Others - not so much. In particular, Mr. Angel Perez from Guest Services was very helplful. The landscaping, pools and beaches were incredible. You can walk freely up and down the beach, unlike some other resorts. The beaches were clean with powdery white sand. The pool was incredible - absolutely enormous weaving through the property. Plenty of comfortable lounge chairs - not a need to stake out chairs. Some women do go topless - be prepared if traveling with children. They have plenty of activities to keep you busy from sun up to sun down - you can take advantage of as much or as little of that as you wish. There is a walking track around the property which provides a nice break, too. You do need to wear a wrist-band the entire time. We found the food to be so-so. The buffet near the beach was generally a mystery - serving uncoverd, over cooked food. The buffet in the main building was fine. All in all... beyond the so-so food, the hotel was very, very nice. Very nicely appointed and clean. We would score it an 8 out of 10. Enjoy!

<Content>Felt like a King and a Queen at the Majestic!! This was our third trip to the Domincan and once again it was an absolutely wonderful experience! Last year we stayed at the Bahai next door and thought it was paradise ...however, the Majestic quickly became our favorite Punta Cana resort! We enjoyed every minute from the moment we arrived . We were immediately checked in and personally escorted to our room by Roberto. Roberto pointed out everything as he guided us to our room (2129). We booked a Junior colonial suite which is a swim out room. Our room was so clean, spacious, and we were greeted with champagne, sculpted towels, flowers, rum, Majestic souvenior shirts and caps ....a most romantic and enchanting ambiance! The shower was huge, (the toilet room is small and probably not comfortable for some), there's a jacuzzi tub in the room (and one outside the patio doors) along with beautiful lounge chairs. (We never did see anyone using the outside jacuzzi tubs) Everyday we left a tip for our maid ($5-$10) and gifts. Our room was cleaned every afternoon while we were out and about and we always returned to flowers, sculpted towels, and the second day a fruit and cheese tray.We started every day by going to the fitness center for a couple hours (we both enjoy a good workout...and never felt too guilty over-endulging in the food department!) The gym met our needs with various cardio equipment and free weights as well as several universal pieces. Outside the fitness center were pool tables, a fooseball table, chess, and tennis racket rentals. (There is also a running circuit around the resort approx. 1200m. once around) Since we never completed our workouts until 11:00 we missed out on breakfast which included everything one could possibly desire from fresh omelette stations to fruit, cereal, sausage, bacon, assorted pastries etc,, etc. The pool area of this resort is certainly it's claim to fame in our opinion, although we only spent 2-3 hours a day in this area.(At the Bahai we had to reserve chairs by 6-7 a.m. or go without) At the Majestic we loved that the pool area was never crowded, there were always chairs, and one had their own space...(the pool wraps around the entire resort and is beautiful!) The beach goes for miles and we spent part of each day walking and enjoying the scenery, the sand sculptures, the flea market (a few kilometers past the Bahai and Riu. )There's many activities at the pool to participate in and on the beach. (pool aerobics, kayaks, banana boat rides, para-sailing, snorkling, beach volleyball etc.)We went on two excursions...one which we love is going to the outback for a day. (approx. $90 a person). This year we went on the tour called a Jeep Safari, which was fantastic (although our jeep was misaligned). We visited a sugar plantation, saw the country side and how the people live, a mountain farm (where they produce coffee, cocoa, make coconut oil, etc.) stopped for lunch, some went for a horseback ride (we never do this....the horses just look so forlorn), then to a virgin beach and we were personally escorted to a school, as I'm a teacher and had brought several school supplies. Our second excursion was an afternoon at their Zip Line, and we quite enjoyed ourselves! My husband and a friend also golfed one day at a nearby course. (Resort offered a little tournament...cost $80.00)For lunch we went to the buffet by the beach....and everything we had was good. The main buffet does offer more of a selection and is better with lots of choices.Our evening meals were all fantastic and our service was great...we tipped lots ($2-$5 ind addition to gum, fancy pens, packages of lindor chocolates, tic-tacs) and were served by such gracious and lovely people! The chateaubriand (steak house) as mentioned in almost every review was superb...the lobster (seafood restaurant) was excellent! (These two resaturants are on the beach....during the day it is the beach buffet and in the evening they divide it in half for their evening meals) We also went to the Gourmet (need reservations for this) and it was good...had the chicken...but we preferred the fore mentioned. We didn't make it to the Japanese (need reservations for the show) or Mexican (Dominican) but others indicated it was reallygood too. We went to the buffet a couple times and there are so many choices...I like the pasta station and seafood) The wine is not great, but no big deal...the Majestic drink is great and their rum is so smooth, many love the Presidente (beer).Anyone who complains about the food at this resort needs to stay at home....we've been to many resorts outside of the Dominican and cruises and it completely bewilders us when we read reviews complaining about the food!Evening entertainment begins at 10:00 at their theatre and was most enjoyable....don't miss the Michael Jackson, the circus, or the Legends. We did go to the Bahai one evening and watched their Legends show which was really good too,The Disco...was okay...but we are older so only visited once, and the casino was fun for one evening, with no expecations of winning.Prior to leaving we had hep shots, took malaria pills and dukoral (for traveller's diarrhea and cholera), as preventatives... we also took prescription antibiotics, and antibiotic cream (for bitres eg. sand fleas...I did get two bites just prior to coming home, but never had previously) and we always take immodium, pepto, tums etc...just in case but have never had a problem. We saw only one mosquito...(by my pillow one morning). We will not take malaria next year as it is hard on one's body.If anyone has any questions or would like pictures feel free to contact us...we will definitely return to this resort!! (we also e-mailed Richard prior to arriving and he was most accomodating...an absolutely wonderful man!)

<Content>Amazing Resort, The Best Staff Just returned from the Majestic, this place was awesome, my husband and I and the couple we were travelling with were treated like kings and queens. The staff were next to none.Big shout out to Richard and Angel. Richard went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and took care of us. Thank you Richard. Our room was beautiful, to our maid Johanna Solano, thank you for taking such good care of us and teaching us some Spanish, and trying to learn English from us. You are a doll.This resort is huge and every inch is beautiful.We recommend the Marinarium snorkeling cruise, the crew is so much fun, and know their business, lots of interesting facts about marine life and the waters of Punta Cana. Quiet and interesting on the way out, fun dancing party on the way back. Thanks again to the best staff, best resort.

<Content>Should be #1! My husband and I stayed at the Majestic for our honeymoon. We stayed March 29 - April 5th.When we first arrived after the 20 minute or so ride to the resort, we were greeted by Richard (couldn't have been more welcoming) he made sure we booked the two restaurants right away (Le Gourmet and Japanese) he then took us to our room (3245) which looked out over the garden path/pool but also had an ocean view. It was amazing. The bed was a roomy four poster king, a jacuzzi seperated the bedroom and the bathroom, double sinks, roomy shower and the toilet stall was a bit small but definitely good enough. There is also a safe to put all of your valuables in which is especially nice to insure for a stress-free vacay! We had towels turned into swans with hibiscus flowers thru-out the room. We also had a bottle of champagne and two glasses waiting for us on the table. Very nice touches!! The weather was beautiful so we straight away put on our bathing suits and walked literally seconds to the beach. There are PLENTY of places to lounge - a ton of little hut umbrellas to keep you shaded (way more so than the other resorts down the way, actually.) The sand and ocean were absolutely breathtaking. The pool was so well maintained that it was never dirty - the staff sure work hard to keep the resort spotless. It was seriously the nicest pool we have ever seen - 400 metre pool with cute bridges scattered here and there, wide ledges on the side so people can move their loungers onto them. The swim up bar has stools so you can sit and drink if you want to. We found that the more rambunctious crowd hung around there. Though we never saw people completely out of hand and obnoxious which was great. The animation team hang out at the pool and give dance lessons, play drinking games, water balloon games, bingo, aerobics, spanish lessons, etcetc.The bars are FAB - we especially liked the lobby bar and the plaza bar. Actually we went wherever Franklin was bartending at. We definitely have to give it up to Franklin, he was one of the nicest, if not, THEE nicest person we met while staying there. His english could be better but he tried to communicate the best he could which we appreciated a lot. The staff also appreciate it a lot if you speak spanish to them, even just the basics, please if you ask for your drinks or food always say POR FAVOR and GRACIAS. We saw a few people that were just so disrespectful to the bartenders that it made us want to slap some sense into them. These people work so hard to make everyones stay enjoyable and memorable. The least we can do is acknowledge them and treat them with respect. The restaurants were great! Our least favorite was Le Gourmet but we only gave it one chance so it could have just been what we ordered so take that with a grain of salt! Our absolute fave was Taino (the mexican/carribean restaurant.) We ate there 3 nights! The chicken fajitas were SUPERB! So good! We enjoyed a lot of mamajuana and coffee there as well after our meals. The wait staff were so friendly! The japanese restaurant was our second favorite. It's worth reserving for sure. We also booked a snorkeling excursion with Modesto, our sunwing representative, which was AWESOME! They take you out on a catamaran party boat and we guarantee you will love every second of this trip - it was beyond amazingly fun and relaxing! You can swim with sharks and stingrays and feed schools of fish! After the snorkeling they take you to shallow water to chill out in while drinking bevies and dancing to Bob Marley! We had a blast!All in all, our vacation exceded our expectations. It's beyond me how this resort slipped from #1 to #3!! We'd be happy to go back there anytime!

<Content>Beautiful Returned a week ago, from the Majestic. 35 of us went down for a wedding. The hotel is very beautiful, the entertainment staff are way too much fun. The food is good but the same day after day. The wedding was very beautiful after some fighting with the hotel-long story but ended up perfect. My daughter and her friend had all their money stolen out of their purses which had not made it to the safe before staff coming in to clean. Not happy about that, but should have been put away-another long story. Overall very happy with the Majestic and would recommend to others. The beach is so beautiful but we ended up at the pool the majority of the time because it was so windy. The staff really made you feel welcome and always happy. Great vacation had by allRose

<Content>Amazing time at the Majestic Just got back from a week at the Majestic and had an AMAZING time. I stayed from April 6th to April 12th, 2008. My group consisted of 10 people. Before our arrival, one of my friends e-mailed Richard, as recommended by other travellers, and upon our arrival, we all ended up with excellent rooms (not sure if that was Richard's doing or just fluke). We were all in building B with a gorgeous view of the pool.The grounds were absolutely beautiful. The huge pool was unbelievable and was always clean. It usually was not a problem finding lounge chairs. The beach was spectacular and again, it was never a problem finding lounge chairs, even for my group of 10 people. The hotel staff always kept the beach clean, and combed the sand every night so it was clean in the mornings. The swimming area was excellent. The hotel grounds were also immaculate. There were always gardeners out maintaining the grounds. I've never seen such care taken as I saw at the Majestic.The food was very good. I don't understand all of the other compliants I've read about the food. For the most part, everything in the buffet restaurant is labelled, so it's easy to see what you're eating. We also ate at the seafood restaurant which was very good; the steakhouse was also very good, the Mexican was very good; but my two favourites were the Japanese which was excellent (the server at the tepanyaki table always keep the excitement going), and Le Gourmet was excellent.Something I'd also like to comment on is the customer service at the hotel. I've never seen anything like this before. Everyone who works there is extremely friendly. You would always get a hola or hello when walking by any of the hotel workers. Someone who quickly become a favourite to my group went by the name of Nelson Mandela. We first met him when he was serving at the beach. He was an extremely friendly, and happy person who we looked forward to seeing every day. He managed to remember the names of all 10 people in my group and went out of his way to visit and find us each day. Remember to look for him - he really made our trip special.As other travellers have mentioned, there is construction going on next door. They are building the Majestic Elegance which will be finished later on this year. As long as you aren't staying in the building facing the construction, you really do not notice it at all. We saw it in the distance, but did not mind at all. Plus it was not noisy, so it was not a bother at all.Overall I would give this hotel an extremely high rating. There really is nothing to complain about. I would definitely go back in the near future.

<Content>A word of caution Extended family just returned from 5-day stay and overall a very pleasant experience. Won't repeat what so many others have said but want to issue a warning: RESPECT that tropical sun, especially if you're at all fair-skinned. My sexagenarian wife had never experienced sunburn, but did so after the first day there...and she wasn't sunbathing. SPF 50 did a good job but wasn't foolproof. I wore a polyester tee-shirt while out and swimming and never did burn.

<Content>Not Recommended just got back I just got back from staying at the Majestic Hotel in Punta Cana. Overall we had an okay time. First of all the hotel is absolutely beautiful and extremely clean, all the shows were great with such talent. The staff was semi-knowledgeable I would recommend bringing a Spanish Translation Language book to and some One Dollar Bills. If you are fluent in Spanish and French you are all set. The pool was beautiful however we spent our time at the beach. The beach was amazing white sands, umbrella huts lounge charis, and crytaly clear waters illuminated with blues, greens, golds just breathless and very warm some women go topless so do not be alarmed. Activities were fun I did the morning stretching and aerobics at the beach and pool what a great work out. There is a gym on site with limited equipment you have to arrive early there is only 2 bikes, elyptco glider, and 2 treadmills which only one works, and a few items. There is a semi-out door running track. The drinks were okay we had the premium gray band around our arm we were supposed to get the top shelf liquor, this was not the case if you wanted top shelf liquor you needed to pay for it and the red wine in the lobby bars was chilled due to the increment weather you needed to ask for it at room temp. Food was nothing but a major problem and dissapointment as far as the Buffets the food was never labeled or covered always left open and flies around the food for me this was a major problem. The food had a funky taste to it it was super salty not jerked but salty. The only resturant that we greatly enjoyed was the Mexican but order off the menu and we had fajitas beef  chicken again very salty. The Japanese was delicious we ate there 3 times food was great. The French is not true French it is a mixture of Spanish and French the wine list was fantastic. We ended up drinking bottles of wine in lieu of food at least we would kill any bacteria that entered into our system. Unfortunately my husband was so sick from the food out of the 7 days he was sick for 5 of those days we went to the pharmacy to obtain some meds the pharmacy only has limited items so before you go bring all medical remedies that suit any illness you may incur. Once we arrived home I now have the same issues. We have traveled to the Carribbean, Europe, and in the US and not once have we ever been this ill.

<Content>Fantastic time at the Majestic! My husband and I and our good friends spent the first week of April at the Majestic . All I can say is WOW! We had so much fun!! Check in was a breeze. Janet at the front desk was so helpful and what a great person. She was there for us all week with any questions or help that we might have needed. She also introduced us to Richard who welcomed us with a big smile. We were brought directly to our rooms, 2147  2148, poolside, just what we had hoped for! And what beautiful rooms they are. So large and comfortable. Couldn't have asked for anything better. And we thought the bed was very comfortable. I know there has been the issue of them being too hard, but we thought it was great! Our luggage was delivered promptly, we immediatly changed into our shorts and went for a walk around the resort. This place is just so gorgeous. The grounds are meticulously kept, the pool always clean and the beach is so nice! Our room was always clean by the time we got back from breakfast and the fridge was always well stocked (Plenty of Presidentes!). The food was great. The main buffet was delicious and always had plenty of variety to choose from. The breakfast buffet was awesome. Loved the sugared donuts and the scrambled eggs! The steakhouse and seafood restaurants (try the Chataubriand and the Grouper) were excellent. Not once did we have to wait to be seated and all of the wait staff and hostesses at all of the restaurants were always so friendly and attentive. We didn't go to the reservation restaurants-not really our taste in food. We just really enjoyed the other restaurants.The pool had to be the nicest pool I have ever seen. It was huge and the water temp just perfect. The swim up bar was lots of fun and the bartenders always kept you laughing. Having a poolside room was SO NICE. Just walk out your back door and into the pool. How great is that! We were also just a minute walk from the beach. PERFECT location for us. The staff, from housekeeping,groundskeepers, bartenders, etc,etc,etc, were always friendly and greeted you with a smile. There is definately a language barrier with some of the staff but as long as you know the basics--Hola, Gracias, etc and just have a positive attitude and smile alot, this really does go a long way. This is true anywhere in the world though! And don't forget your tips-these employees really do work hard to make sure you have a great experience.We really had a wonderful week and met some really nice people while at this resort. We had no trouble with anything, our room was perfect, food was great, weather was great. It was just a terrific vacation and we couldn't have asked for more. The Majestic is a beautiful resort with great people and I would highly recommend staying there. We loved it and would go back in a second!!!!

<Content>GREAT big resort My children ( pre and teens) and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial over Spring Break. The hotel is beautiful and huge.  The grounds are lush,lovely, and well maintained. Several weddings took place during our stay. And I can see why it is such a popular wedding destination.  We booked our hotel and transfer thru Bookit.com and as usual got a terrific deal.  The hotel staff could not be more helpful. When I called to request more towels, we had them within minutes. We tried each restaurant and all were suberb. I have some picky eaters and no one complained at all about the food. The gourmet restaurant was our favourite. If you go the avacado martini is to die for. Every night there was a small appetizer table set up in the walk way. The selection was different every night and there were also different corresponding cocktails offered.  The rooms were quite large and lavish. The pictures you see are accurate. The only problem was that there is really no privacy in the bathroom. It looks lovely with the jacuzzi tub. And it does give the room an open feel. This would be fine for a couple. But we each dressed in the huge shower. Our room was a garden view room. We did have plants and flowering bushes outside our patio. But in reality we looked onto a construction site. We really did not mind because we were not interested in sitting on the patio. The pool is among the largest we had ever seen. This was great for kids and adults alike. The size of the pool and the hotel in general make it difficult to know where your kids are if they want to go from say the beach to the pool alone. The beach was beautiful and well maintained. It is possible to walk from hotel to hotel along the beach. Several bars are located in the pool area and there was someone walking along the beach to get drinks for guests,  The hotel property is huge and very spread out. This could pose a problem if someone has trouble walking. But otherwise it is so lovely no one cares. There is a game area with a pool table, fooze ball and large scale chess set. And a mini castle pool area for smaller children.  There were always fun activities offered and shows each night. We saw a few shows and they were very good. We did not make it to the casino.  We did one tour to swim with sharks and along the coral reef. It was fun excursion and well worth the money.  I will say that the hotel photographers can be a bit pushy in trying to get guests to pose with the different exotic animals. One day a week there is a flea market where local vendors sell their wares. Since there is really no market close by this is a good way to buy local crafts. However, though we thought we had bargained well, we found prices cheaper at the airport.  All and all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Majestic Colonial. And if we are ever in Punta Cana again would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great People The Majestic Colonial is a first class resort. We just returned from a week in paradise. The rooms were kept immaculate, the food (especially a la carte) was great. We had so much fun with the staff there and the animation team was a huge part of that experience. Guys like Francisco, and all the team brought so much energy and fun each and every day and night. That team works and plays hard. We really enjoyed their spirit and playfullness. Thanks for making our experience that much more enjoyable.The beach at the Majestic has sand that is so fine its almost powder. There is service at the beach, however when it gets busy, it's best just to go get your own drink at the beach bar.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, the staff was amazing, they all seemed to really enjoy being there. We would recommend staying at the Majestic and say hi from us (the gang with Paco the beared man)

<Content>Punta-Canada hey there!it is me, jenn bunney, reporting to tell you how AMAZING my stay at the magestic colonial was. i wanted you all to know, that no matter what you do at the resort you will be pleased with everything. just so you know there are many little lovely pick me ups who hang around and pic up young girls around the resort. if you are horny and under forty you will be pleased to know you will be satisfied. 3 the taqui taqui was probably the best dance in history of dances. you dance it about 3 times a day, everyday. i loved my stay completely and enjoyed everyones company there. the whole animation team is there to help you out in anyway possible and are always there to put a smile on your face, they work long days and at the end of a long shift they are still dancing and having a great time. RAY was probably the best part of my experiance there. he made every daay SUPA fun and i absolutely enjoyed the Water aerobics and latte night discoing with my new besstie RAY. The photographers on the resort took lovely photos and they were SUPA sweet persons. I will TRULEE Miss em. I will also Never forget the miss Bikini contest at the pool. almost won that bad boiii. I was the cutest one. OBVS. Francisco who was part of the animiation was SUPA fun to Play with on the beacch. And the games the resort had made it UNFORGETTABLE. The water- 110% LOVED IT . GORG. Would never ask for anything more. Sand-Cute much? FOOD- TASTYLICIOUS Rooms- A+STAFF- 500% GREAT. I LOVE THE MAJESTIC COLONIAL.

<Content>Very nice resort!!!!! Overal this was a very nice resort.. The food was good! the service was great! We found the grounds to be amazing! the beech was very well kept also! MY room did have a musty smell that took awhile to get use to but I did do a last minute get away and relize that I proble got a run of the house room. When i asked other felow canadians we met if there room was musty they laughed and thought i was joking. If your looking for a nice relaxing vacation this is the place to be!!!! Dont be scared to venture off the resort as we did and enjoyed a night at a local hot spot called mango's. The local beech market seems to be way over priced compared to other trips ive been. But you can get items half of what they ask. I booked a four wheeler adventure on the resort at a stand and got tookin for STAY CLEAR book with ur travel agent!!! BUT i booked my fishing at the watersport shack at the water front and caught a nice big marlen even when they were out of season! I rate this resort 4 out of 5 because my room was musty smelling, besides that everything else was perfect!!!!!!!!!

<Content>fall into paradise Well I have now returned to Canada with a healthy brown glow and an incredibly relaxed demeanor. My younger bro and his now wife just chose the Majestic to be married at and I am so glad they did. From the moment you arrive till the moment you leave everything is taken care of. The pool is amazing, the beach is amazing, the food and especially the staff are amazing. I didn't really know what to expect as I have never been to an all inclusive before, but I have a feeling I was incredibly spoiled. We were there for a week, but I could have stayed forever, well maybe not forever, but for a long while. They have a variety of restaurants to choose from and entertainment all day and into the night. The entertainment group they have is really exceptional and always had something fun going on like dance or spanish lessons, sporting events and live shows at night. Very high energy with Caribbean flair. It wouldn't have been the same without them. I really loved my time there and would highly recommend this resort to anyone. They even rake the seaweed off the beach....which kinda blew my mind. The only thing that sucks is that eventually you have to leave. Beautiful people at a beautiful place.

<Content>The entertainment was amazing too, especially Jesus' enthusiasm My friends and I were in Punta Cana and stayed at the Majestic Colonial Hotel for 1 week during the March 2008 break. Wow! We had a fabulous trip. What a beautiful county and what a magnificent Hotel. Too bad we couldn't have stayed much longer . The hotel was to die for. Cleaner than clean. And the food, well you surely couldn't complain. There was always more than enough and tonnes to choose from. Enough to feed a king and for the picky eater. The pool/beach were both very spectacular too. Also what made the trip for me, was the staff. They were all so friendly, fun and kind. I'm talking about all the staff at the Majestic, from the ones who greet you when you arrive, to the daily servers you see every morning who serve you your breakfast, the cleaning staff who picks up after you and of course the entertainment staff. They did their job with such enthusiasm and they all had such talent. They really knew how to get the guests to participate, especially Jesus, he went out of his way. Of course I would love to have the chance to stay at the Majestic again.Thanks so much, Teresa

<Content>An Amazing Family Environment We enjoyed the family oriented facility. They treated us like we were apart of a family, never allowing us to feel a second of bordem. The Animation team were excellent motivators that never seemed to run out of energy. We would like to extend our thanks to Maria, Maggie, and Pablo who we excellent entertainers at the childrens mini club. Many planned acivities such as football(soccer), beach volleyball, games that allowed patrons to participate in friendly competition. Amazing white sand beach, and clear blue ocean greeted you every morning, before heading off to have breakfast at the Majestics all you can eat breakfast buffet; were the selection of breakfast foods is never ending. We will miss our evening dinners at the resort steak house which is located close to the beach; they serve an amazing cheteaubriand. The most amazing wait staff supplied us with great service, and never left us unsatisfied. I will miss the Majestic Colonial, because it has brought me new understanding of love.

<Content>beautiful resort Firstly, a little bit about us...we travel every year to the caribbean and we usually travel with 2 or 3 other couples. Our group is around 30 - 35 years old and we always stay in 5 star hotels. Our group consists of mostly teachers so we travel during March break every year. I'm fairly picky and I'm a stickler for good service... although I don't expect miracles.Even though we had some major problems at check in, this is still one of the nicest resorts we've been to.I only have 2 problems with this resort... the bar, and the front desk. We had a true nightmare with the front desk. When we arrived at the hotel it was 4am. We were greated at the steps by the night manager and he told us that the hotel was overbooked and that we would have to stay at another hotel for the night. He assured us that the hotel was very sorry for our inconvenience and that we would be compensated for our troubles. I wasn't really happy about it, but I know that this happens from time to time, and that it would only be for a couple of hours any way. He said the other resort was just around the corner. He had one of the staff drive us to the other resort. When we get there, they say that they know nothing about this but that they'll gladly take us for the night... $185... cash or credit. I told them that I wasn't going to pay, they'll need to arrange payment with the other resort...I already paid for my vacation. The two hotel managers argued on the phone for an hour in spanish and took turns waiting on hold while I got more frustrated. Finally they convinced me that it would just be a deposit, and that when the day shift managers came in, they would sort it all out and that my credit card would be reimbursed. After I put the $185 (per person as it turns out) on my credit card they took us to our room...is was 7am by they time we were in bed. When we woke up, we went to see the front desk to finalize things with the day manager and go back to the Majestic... of course he knew nothing about this. after trying to explain this for half an hour I was so fed up that I just checked out and took a taxi to our resort. They now had a room for us... but here too the manager denied knowing anything about our situation. After speaking with our tour operator, we got $350 back in Cash from the hotel, along with a free late checkout and a 55 massage. Our tour operator also gave us a free excursion work a maximum of $100/person. I think the compensation was fair...even though I paid $370 for the room at the other hotel.With all that being said...the screw up is mostly due to the Majestic's popularity on TripAdvisor (well mostly the incompetant front desk staff which is common at these resorts). This is the first time we've been to a resort that was actually full. Usually all the flights are full because of March break, but the resorts still have room. The resort was at full capacity the whole time we where there... although it didn't seem crowded anywhere like other resorts we've been to. The resort itself was beautiful and we really enjoyed our stay.I know it sounds weird to say that we enjoyed ourselves after the ordeal we had to go through... but it was a really nice resort. The rooms were really nice, the pool was huge, the beach is amazing, and the restaurants were above par...I didn't really have any bad meals, and I'm picky.We were checked in, the only thing I have to complain about, is the bar... which isn't a show stopper for me. Getting a drink from the bar was like spinning a roulette wheel... sometimes you got what you ordered, and sometimes you didn't. If you got what you ordered, it probably tasted different then the last time you had it. The beer was consistent. And I know that this is common in Dominican.

<Content>What are these people writing review talking about? We visited the Majestic Colonial from Mar 22nd to the 29th. Upon arriving at the hotel we were immediately checked in and taken to our room. The room was very nice with a king size bed, jacuzzi bath, twin sinks, toilette and stand up shower. We arriived late and went to bed. Found the bed a little hard for our liking so in the morning went to the front desk to ask them if they could do anything to solve the problem. They immediately sent someone to our room to put a mattress topper on the bed and that solved the problem. We found the staff to be friendly and very accomodating. Our room faced a construction site and we asked would they change our room if we found it too noisy, they said absolutely, however the site did not cause us a problem and we stayed put.The restaurants were good. The steak house served a great chateaubriand and the sea food restaurant had great lobster, red snapper and shrimp. The buffet had lots of choice and had cooking stations if you want fresh crepes, eggs or omelettes. The specialty restaurants had very nice decor but the food was better in the steak and seafood resaurants. Having said that they were still fine.The pool was great, very big and very clean. The beach was good as well. A couple of days a large amount of seaweed was washed up but they cleaned the beach quickly and it realy wasn' a problem.We've been to Punta Cana three times and I would rate this holel as one of the best. If your the kind of person who wants to find a problem, I'm sure you could but you would have to look very hard.

<Content>A great vacation at a lovely resort! February 1, 2008 we returned from a wonderful vacation at Majestic Colonial, Punta Cana Dominican Republic. After having read some of the reviews we were quite worried, but unnecessarily so. Our family of five (three teens) traveled with a large group of 26 (wedding) and all had a great time! Admittedly, some more than others. Vacations are all about attitude. Punta Cana, the Majestic Colonial is a beautiful five star resort. Our family is I believe seasoned travelers, usually staying each year at a different location in Mexico or Costa Rica. This was our first time to the Dominican Republic. No regrets. Being we traveled with a large group we received the group rate which is cheaper than that traveling as a family of five, especially when the teens are paying adult fares. Getting to the resort: The Punta Cana airport was quaint - it is a small airport and it was built to exude Caribbean style with thatch roofs and open ceilings. At the airport, you are aggressively approached by workers who want to help you with your luggage. They live off the tips. A dollar was fine. They do not have their hands out but are visibly sad when you walk away without tipping. I recommend you get one of them to help. The airport is small, but, it is not necessarily well marked. They were helpful finding our tour bus. Be sure to take just one dollar (US) bills with you as they will not give change. I ordered them from the bank as one dollar units. There were some down sides but not of the resort itself. Mainly of its location: nothing is close by. No towns or shopping areas. There is a small Market with very aggressive sales people. (not fun for me but the teens sure enjoyed it) Punta Cana is even a fair drive away. However, that did not stop us from traveling out to swim with the sharks and the sting rays. This was a good days catamaran excursion, but the drinks they serve are VERY WATERED down鈥?snacks were safe. When we were on this catamaran tour and snorkeled by the reef, the waves/ strong water current tuckered us out and we felt we could not get back to the catamaran. The crew was very attentive and swam out to bring us in.The color of the water there is magnificent; the sand is among the nicest you'll find in the Caribbean. We actually had fun feeding the fish right there at the resort: we stuffed bananas in an empty water bottle and while snorkeling slowly squeezed the food out. . . we saw tiger fish, barracudas ecetera. Great time. The water is tough there too, with a strong undercurrent. We are not strong swimmers so calm days were important to us. Even on the stronger days though, we would get gently towed down the beach to the next resort and just walked back. Not really an issue. It did not frighten us or make us feel we were being pulled out to sea. We did take our own snorkel gear too and SANDSHOES as there are rough spots of coral where we were snorkeling by the resort rope water boundaries. The staff are happy and try to please, few understand English, this is the first resort we have been to that the staff were not schooled in the basics of English. 鈥?they do try but progress over the past two years has been poor. . We spoke several times to Raphael before the trip, (from the reservations office) he was very good with his English. He treated us with a great deal of respect and ensured we had an adjoining room with our teens. This was perfect! We met him on arrival and thanked him personally. The rooms are very large and clean. The doors do not have peep holes or safety chains. Our card keys did not work well, we were constantly getting them reprogrammed. Not really an issue as we had five keys so usually one worked to get us in the room. The maids in our rooms were consistently good and did an excellent job in keeping the rooms clean. We did tip a dollar per day. This kept our room fridges full of beer and water. She also left us 鈥渕ucho towels鈥?Being with teens this was great. The bathroom area is not very private and our teens were self conscious with the shower set up. However having read about this in advance, I did take down some string and used an extra blanket to make a temporary wall for privacy. The string tied easily around the pillars by the open room tub. The hotel would do well to set up a permanent privacy curtain that could nicely complement the room and be held back for those that have no issues being open to the entire room and potentially anyone walking by if you forget to close the balcony curtains. We also received champagne, wine and fruits throughout the week. Why one evening we even received sushi! Delicious !!!!! . There was a turn down service for some of our group members. We had the turn down service two nights before leaving. However, part of this included spraying the pillows with a perfume.(We walked into the room when they were doing it.) This caused an allergic reaction for my face. Was not pretty! SO we made sure they did not do it again. The food was similar to most resorts we have been to. We felt there was lots of variety and the main area to eat was clean, bright and many table/seats. Never a problem to locate with a large group. We did not make it to the other restaurants as they booked up quickly after our first day there. We had no regrets eating at the two main restaurants: one by the beach and the other 鈥淭he Supreme鈥?No one in our group got sick. You cannot drink the water from the tap there. Nor use it to brush your teeth. They provide lots of bottled water in the room/fridge. This is not uncommon; we experienced this at other 5 star resorts.The resort is not a high rise (we liked that) but it is big. However we were not displeased with this. There were ample lawn chairs by the pool and beach. We never had a problem locating space for our group. The pool was amazing! Long and winding throughout the middle of the resort. It was not that deep for us non swimmers. We spent many hours having fun in the pool. We did bring our own tube floaters which were a savings as we paid ten dollars Canadian for them and there they sold for more than twenty in the resort 鈥淢ini Mart鈥? There is one place where you can get towels but it is centrally located. Adding an extra location wouldn鈥檛 be a bad idea closer to the pool bar. The pool bar was at the far end. Not well populated as in a shady area. Would be a good idea if they put another one at the opposite end of the pool near the main area. There was a bar there but it was not a pool bar. Guests stay in one of four buildings - with construction for an adjacent resort going on by building four. The construction was not noisy but when they did work on it, it was entertaining to watch. We stayed in building three which is joined to four. We had no issues with the construction. Building 1, was a few yards away from another resort, with the view of brightly colored building. The entire area was really quite picture perfect! The only oddity was no birds or insects (other than mosquitoes) Lawns are weedless. We were thinking they must use lots of insecticides or weed killers that eliminate the insects and ultimately the birds don鈥檛 hang out there. Mosquitoes were present in the evening while we watched the theatre, and also in our rooms at night. They did not bother anyone else in our group just my one daughter and I. I would line the bottom of the balcony and doors with towels in an attempt to decrease their odds from getting into the room at night. I also came armed with raid and would strategically spray around the doors. This helped. I also had deep woods-off but refused to sleep with it on my face. On the note of the balcony or ground level walk out area.. take your key or be sure someone can let you back into the room as the door locks if closed and you cannot get back in.After ten there was a snack bar /bar open with hot food. This place is close to the theatre down from the mini mart and it served fries, nachos, yummy chicken or hamburgers. Behind it was a place our teens could play foosball, floor chess, pool and ping pong. There is a place to gamble but the cigarette smoke was too thick.. we did not take part in that. Cigarette smoke was bad also in the upper main foyer bar. The internet caf茅 was good for the teens: expensive though $5.00 US for 30 minutes. Do watch your change at the Mini Mart. She tries to give you candy instead of the right change. I had to push to get my change: she finally did in Dominican money and that was okay as we spent it in the next store on jewelry. They do bring in some vendors during the week. This was fun as our family loves to barter. Necklaces started at eighty dollars and we walked away with two for twenty dollars (US). The wooden faces were cheaper in the stores but we liked the vendors better, when we told him we鈥檇 buy in the store cheaper he bettered the price. All in all we felt safe and relaxed. The staff were friendly, smile a lot. Security around the resort is visible especially near the construction site. Tennis courts were a walk away but available. Really there is no reason to be board. We had a great vacation.

<Content>Great Time at a Great Place! My family had a great time at Majestic. My mom, stepdad, and 4 brothers all went down for spring break. Myself and brothers age range is 14-26yrs, me being the oldest.The rooms: Very nice, marble floors, jacuzzi tub, large shower, twin sinks, balcony patio with swimsuit drying rack, etc...They could definitely use a de-humidifier to help with the moisture, but it's not horrible. A note on the location of the rooms: We had what I would consider the perfect location, building 2, facing the pool, room # in the mid twenties. But really, the distance isn't more than a 2 minute walk to anything no matter what room you're in, so it's not a big deal, other than to be facing the pool rather than construction or something else. The sliding door to the patio is soundproof, but the door to the hall is not, because there is no threshold or anything to keep the sound out, which is a bit of a problem if you like to sleep in in the morning. Because it's mentioned often, I'll try to describe the bathroom situation more clearly, since I didn't really know what people meant by no privacy. The bathroom is not a separate room. If you walk into the room and turn right, to the right are your sinks, in front of you is a shower and right next to that is your toilet. The shower and toilet both have frosted opaque glass doors with a foot of space above and below the door. To your left is the jacuzzi tub, and just to the left of the tub is the rest of the room. So basically, if you take a loud crap, anyone else in the room is going to hear it. End of story.The Food:We thought it was great. This is probably the one thing in all of the reviews here that varies the most, and it honestly surprises me that it does. Of the 7 restaurants, in my mind it really boils down to 1 place you want to eat every meal: The grand buffet, which supposedly counts as 2 or 3 of the restaurants. There is such a huge variety here that you can't possibly go away hungry because you couldn't find something you like. It serves all 3 meals every day, and includes a wide variety of fresh fruits, cooked vegetables, meats, dessert bar, and has several grilling and pasta stations where they cook something for you. We tried the Gourmet restaurant and were thoroughly unimpressed--10 menu items total and quality was the same as the buffet. The beach buffet has decent food if you don't want to go inside to eat, but the quality is generally much worse compared to the indoor buffet. My best advice is to just go to the indoor buffet every day, try a lot of different things, and eat more of what you like. We were there 7 days and had zero stomach problems, with the exception of my stepdad who had mild issues the last 3 days. Only guess is that it could have been the salad because he eats a lot of that, and that's the only thing my brothers and I didn't eat much of there.The Beach/Pool:Awesome pool. Temperature was perfect in my mind. Maybe that's because I was either playing volleyball or swimming. I'd imagine it might be cool if you sat around and got drunk at the bar in the shade, but if you're in the sun it feels fantastic. The beach was nice, plenty of chairs, and you could go on very very long walks if you wanted. You can even have a bit of fun visiting other all-inclusives and sampling if you catch my drift... The ocean kayaks were fun too, although the current is very strong and I think anyone that isn't in shape would have a bit of trouble.One thing they severely needed: A nice hot tub. The 2 hot tubs are part of the spa and not supposed to be accessed from the pool I don't believe, but they were merely warm tubs with generally no one in them.Entertainment/Gym:The nightly shows were a mixed bag. The michael jackson show is obviously the best, the celeb show is good, as are the perfect couple and circus shows. The magician was a bit weak to me, relying on the same in the box, now gone type of trick one too many times. One thing to keep in mind if you bring young children, the shows start at 10pm and many of them are not intended for children in my opinion, unless you're very comfortable with partial nudity and/or sexual themes.The entertainment team is a lot of fun, and they run the games and classes during the day. If you volunteer for some game you've never heard of, prepare to be embarrassed and required to do some sort of sexy dance as part of it. Their bikini contest was kind of weird though, because the girls were all 16-18 (it was high school spring break, not college) and you got a very distinct pedo vibe from a lot of the old guys gathered around. Not to mention 16 is underage in a lot of countries.The gym was pretty decent. It has free weights for people that know what they're doing, and machines for people who don't. Also plenty of cardio equipment.The DR itself:Seemed very poverty-stricken from what you can see on the way to the resort. A lot of garbage on the side of the roads, roads in incredibly bad shape and seemingly twisting and turning for no reason, etc... Also there is a distinct hustler feeling if you visit any local shops down the beach or the little flea market that gets setup once in a while on the resort. If you actually decide to buy some trinkets or jewelry, be prepared to bargain extremely hard and lowball the hell out of them because a necklace that they initially asked $140 for, ended up with them offering $20 when my brother decided to walk. They will make unreasonable quotes and try to get you to bargain down to something that's still a ripoff.Overall, if you want to relax by the pool and read, walk on the beach, eat good food, workout, and be entertained, you'll have a nice time. If you want 5-star spa service, flawless rooms, and 5-star service, you'll be disappointed. Hope this helps.

<Content>Excellent Vacation ***** My husband and I just got back yesterday from a weeks stay at the Majestic. There were 8 of us that went ranging from the age of 32 to 61. I read a lot of reviews before we went and got nervous. Let me tell you, this place is wonderful. Check in: When we got to the hotel we were greeted with a cool towel and the Majestic drink. Franklin at the front desk was wonderful and got our rooms all on the same floor. We were in the third building on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool. The rooms were excellent and huge. They were very clean. Grounds and Pool: The grounds are beautiful. Very well kept, always sweeping and mopping, picking up other peoples trash. The pool was the best one I have ever seen at any resort. One warning: the chemicals in the pool turned the white in our swimsuits green. But hey when you have a pool as big as this one with as many people in it I guess a clean pool is better than a white suit! We never had problems getting 8 chairs by the pool or beach. The beach was wonderful too.Bars: For those of you who say the drinks are not good or strong enough, you obviously have a drinking problem. I am from Wisconsin originally (and we all know how they drink), and there were many days when several people in our party were a little tipsy! We NEVER had to wait for a drink. Most times we had a new one coming before we were done with the one in our hand. Victor at the pool bar was AWESOME!! Yeah baby!!! We did tip and the employees truly appreciate it. Some people that visit this country are very ignorant and don't realize what these people are getting paid and going home to. Dirt floors, no running water etc. People in this country don't go to school the way students do in the US, so yes their english is not very good. Remember You are in their country, respect them. I suggest taking the Bavaro Runners tour. It was about 80 dollars but well worth it. Gave you a good idea of how people live there. The 4 wheeling tour was also very good. A few in our party did the zip lining and enjoyed it very much. Food: We went to every restaurant (except the Japanese) and found all the food to be good. There are so many restaurants to choose from, if you can't find something you like then you are just too picky. It is critical that you don't drink the water. The water in the restaurants and the ice is okay. Don't use the ice machines. Don't brush your teeth with the tap water. Don't rinse your toothbrush with tap water. Use bottled water. Many people don't use bottled water and they wind up getting sick. We had no problems. It is something you really need to think about. There were several times when I would be brushing my teeth and turn the sink on and think Oh can't do that. The casino is small but very fun. The roulette table was a blast. Yes the dealers made some mistakes that you had to keep an eye out for, but remember, most of these people don't go to school the way we do. The staff at this hotel was great. Very accomodating and always greeted you with a smile. If you want a wonderful, relaxing, and enjoyable vacation, this is the place for you. The worst part of the trip was having to go home. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me! I would be happy to answer. :-)jbirdj2@verizon.net

<Content>Worth visiting I just spent about a week at this resort (16/3 - 24/3). It is fairly new and the overall condition and appearance of everything - from rooms to restaurants - was very good. The food is decent. Spirits are low quality, although the local rum (Brugal) is very good. I opted for a more expensive room on the top floor to shelter myself from guest noise (door banging, etc.). I think it was a Colonial Junior Suite. It had two outdoor decks, one was very large with an outdoor jacuzzi and plenty of room for relaxing. I went during a holiday/vacation week (both locally in Dominican Republic and for many US schools) so there were a lot of families with younger kids (teenagers) around - to whom the resort caters to just fine. Probably not the best place for singles ages 20-40 as there is little night life, etc. For this you have to grab a taxi and head to one of the local clubs. The staff is typically very friendly, although the reception staff (check-in and check-out) could use some improvement (knowledge about hotel, dealing with guest issues, personalities, etc). I did not have too many issues with them, but witnessed plenty of other people's frustration there. The BEST part of my experience was the entertainment/animation staff. They are great - very friendly and they show geniune enjoyment in their work and interaction with guests. I did not get a chance to meet all of them, but I did have a fair amount of interaction with two in particular - Jesus and Lina. Jesus is typically the MC for daytime events. He speaks English, Spanish and French and is extremely friendly and knowledable so don't hesitate to approach him. Lina leads daily exercise sessions, such as aerobics at both the pool and beach. Her big bright smile and positive attitude make it hard not to join in the activities. You can also find both of them - with some of the other staff - at the resort's disco every night helping those of us less gifted dancers take on salsa dancing, etc. Lina and Jesus get 5 stars from me - thanks for making my stay more enjoyable! Again the other entertainers where great too, I just didn't get a chance to interact with them. Overall I think the resort was a pretty good value. It is big and a little busy for my liking (could have just been the timing of my stay), but I would recommend it to family and friends. I would go back again. I hope someone finds this information helpful. Happy travels!

<Content>Majestic Paradise My husband and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana during the March break, from the 8th to the 15th. The weather was beautiful the entire week. We arrived in the early afternoon and were greeted with the nice, cool towels and the signature Majestic drink. Initially, we had some problems with our room. We requested a quiet room overlooking the pool. What they gave us and most of the Air Canada Vacation travellers was a room in building 4 looking over the construction area. I took my initial request with me, presented it to Richard and Victor. It took about an hour, but we finally got a room in building 2 floor 3 overlooking the quiet end of the pool. You do have to stand your ground with these people. We made our reservations in Sept. of 2007 and we were told the hotel was overbooked! The rest of the week was a piece of heaven. This was our 25th wedding anniversary and our first time visiting the Dominican Republic. Our room was very spacious and always kept spotless. We did not mind the bathroom setup. The huge shower was great! We had wonderful service from our maid. The air conditioning and fan always worked. We had champagne upon our arrival, a fruit plate another night and on our last evening a special anniversary cake. Nice touch folks!The pool was amazing and was always clean. We found the water temperature perfect. It was a wonderful way to cool off from the heat. We spent much of our time at the beach as we enjoy swimming in the warm Caribean waters, walking the wonderful, white sandy beaches and lounging under the papala huts. The food was good. We did begin to tire of the Supreme Buffet by the end of the week. We had excellent meals at the Gourmet restaurant, the Rodeo restaurant (especially the Chateaubriand), the Dominican and Mexican restaurant. I did begin to feel unwell on our last day. It was probably the chicken I had at the Jelly Fish Restaurant after our sunset cruise in Bavaro Beach. All in all, we would return to the Majestic in a flash. The people there are hard workers, they always greet you with Hola and produce a wonderful smile. We did tip and it did make a difference. I guess we had good luck. We're not fussy people and I certainly enjoyed not having to cook, clean or do laundry for a whole week!!

<Content>Excellent Trip PLEASE ignore any negative reviews you may read regarding this resort, as it was amongst our favourite resorts, and we will definately be back again!As mentioned in everyone elses reviews, the beaches are gorgeous, the grounds are breathtaking, and the rooms are spectacular. All of the staff constantly smile and are friendly, and any request you may have is almos timmediatley met!Extra special touches really add to the experience:- Denny - the beach concierge - wou contantly ensures you are well refreshed while relaxing on the beach!- bottle of champagne awaiting you in your room.- grilled lobster on the seafood menu- ease of getting reseravtions in the a la carts- professional photographers roaming the property.All in all, this resort is well worth the money - especially if you get one of the pool view rooms in block 2 or 3 closest to the ocean (we were in 3244 - which was an ideal location). Anyone who was disappointed in either the food or the resort in general has expectations beyond reality.Book this resort with confidence!!!

<Content>loved it all My husband and I just got back on march 27, from one week at Majestic. It was fabulous. This was the best resort we have been to so far. The service was excellent. We loved the food, there was lots of variety. We only tried one a la carte, the steak house: it was great. My husband took the filet mignon and said it was delicious. The drinks were very good. This was the first time we didn't get sick from the food on a vacation. The staff is very friendly and willing to help. They kept our room very clean. There are enough lounge chairs for everyone, but if you want a hut, you have to put your towel on a chair before breakfast. We loved the saxophone players at night. We found the night entertainment was a bit too late for us, but that's just because we are early birds. I would go back for sure and would recommend it to everybody.

<Content>Majestic Colonial We just returned from a 1 wk. stay at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana, and had to say we had a wonderful time. The service that we received was outstanding. We never had to wait for anything--service during meals, maid service etc. Any negative reviews that you may have read previously should be taken with a grain of salt. They were probably written by demanding, rude individuals who's glass is always half empty. A little kindness and respect goes a long way in Punta Cana. We got to meet Richard, who is a very kind and accomodating individual. All the staff was kind and went out of their way to make our stay unforgettable.

<Content>Loved the Majestic and Animation Team My wife and I along with my two kids aged 11 and 8 just returned from our vacation in Punta Cana in the DR (March 18-25). We stayed at the Majestic Colonial on the third floor overlooking the gardens and ocean. Overall, the stay was magnificent and the people and weather were great! We tend to travel quite a bit and have an appetite and liking for finer accomodations and settings. We thoroughly researched a couple of places and choose the Majestic based on its 5star rating, location, and past reviews. I highly recommend the Majestic and would not hesitate to return back. Here's my snapshot review of the vacation:Room:Comfy, large, and contained two double beds and a cot plus a huge shower. We requested a room with an ocean view and wanted to be on the third floor. The room was clean, the bar was always stocked with water and beer. Neg - beds aren't the most comfortable and the room lacked privacy especially for my wife who has two boys. There's no place to dress after a shower. Tip: Make sure you state you do not want a room facing the construction of the New Majestic Excellence that is getting built next to the resort. We met people who had a room with a construction view - still in the concrete phase - not pretty at all. Request a room facing the interior gardens. All rooms are close walking distance to the beach..unlike some hotels where you have to take the trolley or takes 15 minutes to walk to the beach.Animation Team: Love them, Love them!!! Part of the enjoyment of any travel experience for us are the people who entertain. The Majestic Animation Team was simply so much fun and always ready to entertain and make you laugh! I'll never forget Lina and her non-stop energy, beauty and smile. Rey, Sandy, Jesus, Samuel, Francisco, and Leo were super cool guys and always made us feel special and constantly joked with us lol. We were amazed how much energy they all had beginning early morning until the early hours of the morning at the disco. When you have to say your goodbyes to them and you're holding back a few tears, you know they are special and integral to the success of the resort! Beach:Aside from the rare 15 foot wave that crashed into the beach shore, forced an evacuation of the entire coast line, and caused erosion damage, the beach was simply beautiful! Clear blue water on a slightly slopey and sandy beach that is lined with palm trees made a picture perfect post-card! The beach was closed for the first two days of our vacation so we had to hang out at the pool - kinda got the feeling when a part of North America was blackedout where everyone hung out together at the pool making it a festive atmosphere! On the third day, the beach reopened and was swimmable. Some of the ocean's floor was lined with coral rock making it a bit uncomfortable but many of the tourists were removing them by hand. By the fifth day, there was significanlty less rock on the bottom. Snorklers were pulling out beautiful shells as a result of the wave storm. The Majestic probably had the most loungers and umbrella huts than any other resort on the strip. Tip: if you want a nice location with lounger and umbrella, place your towels upon your late night return from the disco or early morning around 6-7am. Everybody did this and respected people' reservations. Pool - The best pool i ever swam in. It is long, wide, meanders around the resort and spans continously from one end of the hotel to the other. No shortage of loungers, but again, we recommend to reserve your spot early in the morning or else you won't get a spot or umbrellla hut. If you have young kids like us, the entire pool is around 4 feet so we felt comfy letting our boys roam freely. Yes there's a swim up bar with the best bartender that our family likes to call ya baby. Victor was super and always made my boys laugh. It was routine for them to stop at Victors for a non-gasonline (non-alcoholic) pina colada!Food - We ate at the Supreme Buffet - great variety and good quality food. We did kinda get sick of it by day 4-5 because our kids were not into dining at the a la carte restauarants. I'd say its above average with excellent service. Always had hot fresh food stations for breakfast, lunch, and supper. Best chicken i ever tasted, beef is okay, and coffee was super..and i love my Timmys and Starbucks. Again, the staff was super!!! We ate once at the Japanese restauarant and didn't really enjoy it. It appered to have a great selection of sushi if you're into it..we're not. The food we ordered off the menu was kinda blah. I felt like leaving and going to the buffet but it was a nice change of scenary.We often had lunch at the beachside restaurant. Great sandwiches albeit the sandwich guy didnt seem too happy. Never a shortage of burgers, hot dogs, and salads. Nice walk up bar too, especially if you're hanging at the beach and need to cool down. At nigth this restuarant turns into a seafood and steak place. We never had supper there, but we did hear mix reviews, mostly good. There's a super place for late night snacks and munchies located next the nightclub - best burgers and wings (add tobasco and ketchup). A couple of our friends went to the Gourmet Restaurant and were disappointed. If you plan to go, make sure you bring long pants for the guys and kids. Kids under a 12 are not allowed to go hence why we ate mostly at the buffet. The mexican place looked foreign to us so we never ate their either. Despite mixed reviews about the a la cartes..the buffet was great. We really enjoyed the fruit and pastries too!Nightly Entertainment:-Animation team would always open up the shows with audience participation activities. Tons of laugh!!All the shows were way better than we expected. Must see the Michael Jackson and the Music Legend Show - wow!!! After the show, the Animation team would head over to the disco and teach a few dominican line dances...the club tends to empty out quick unless there's a large group of tourists travelling together - in our case there were 65 portuguese students who always made the club looked filled. When they left, the club tended to think out quickly. Many partiers would head over to another nearby club that was10 minutes away. My wife and I enjoyed dancing there, mingling with the Animation team, and others! Good mix of music too. Next to the disco was a casino..small but served the purpose. Exercise and Spa : I used the exercise room regularly. Impressed with it given that most resorts have very small rooms. This one had all the machines and free weights. The guy who worked there provided super service! Neg - the gym had a bit of a musty cabbage like smell...quickly disappated once you were in. Next to the gym was a kids gaming area - had foozball, pool, etc..We never used the spa, but i did inquire because it looked specatacular...if you want a spa vacation, the Majestic has a great one!! We were too burnt to take advantage of it! If you want your hair braided and a temporary tatoo do not, i say do not go to the lady working at the resort by the beach. She originally wanted to charg my wife $30 dollars for 5 braids...my wife talked her down to $20. We later found out, other had their entire hair down for $30-$40. A friend of ours got a temporary tattoo for $10...she wanted $25 for the same one when we inquired. We later walked down the beach and found non-resort workers who did hair and tattoos for a lot less. This lady really rubbed my wife the wrong way.Other: This resort is simply beautiful and looks majestic, especially at night with all the lights and fountains. . It has a grande open air lobby, piano bar, beautiful bars, and outdoor patios. Reminded us of the titanic, espeically the grande staircase in the lobby. Our experience at the Majestic Colonial was super and first class all the way. Everyone worked hard to impress! Service all around was excellent and would 100% return to this beautiful hotel.

<Content>I loved it! After spending a week in a 1 bedroom suite at the Majestic in Punta Cana D.R..(16th-22rd March 2008). I have to report that I had a fantstic stay. After reading some negitive reviews about the property i was a little concerned about staying there. But I am so glad to say it is my favorite a.i. resort in P.C. (compared to Excellance P.C and Riu Palace P.C.)The hotel itself is grand with a long winding pool and beautiful ocean layout. and the staff was the best. Always with a smile and eager to please attitude. Our room was a 1 bedroom suite which was nicer then we expected (3411) with a pool/ocean view. A bit big for two but we enjoyed the space and felt at time like royalty relaxing on the big leather sofa.The food served at the restaurants was good (not great) similar to what we experienced at the above mentioned resorts. And if interested neither of us got sick. Should be noted-We came to the D.R. for warm weather and great beaches not for fine dining.Over all this is a very nice resort with fantastic staff and would highly reconmend the property to friends and family.Thanks so much to everyone who took the time to write a review in regards to the Majestic.Special thanks to Richard and Roberto -front desk)Feel free to i.m. if you have any specific questions

<Content>Loved it We stayed at the majestic from Feb 21th to Feb 28th. When we booked this trip, the Majestic was rated as the #1 resort in Punta Cana here. Then, people started complaining about a couple of things and to be honest, just before leaving, I didnt really know what to expect anymore. My first tip is to lower your expectations. I know this is a 5 star resort and when you book at a 5 star resort, you expected to be treated like a king/like a special guest but you got to remember that nothing can be perfect.Service:The service at the front desk was perfect. It didnt take us long to check in/check out. Ask for a room that is not in the block #4 (They are building a resort next to the block #4). If you ask it nicely, they will probably move you to another block. I heard a guy ask one of the front desk guy ''Hey move me to another room, I dont want to be in the block #4''. The guy didnt even say hola/hi/gracias/thank you. Be nice with the people there and they will be nice with you. If you are friendly and cool with people, they will be friendly and cool with you.Rooms:We had a nice room. The only thing we didnt like about our room is the fact that the bath is in the middle of the room and we didnt have any privacy at all. My mom had to tell me to leave the room so she could take a bath. I didnt mind leaving as I was hungry and i went to the buffet :). There is also a shower (not in the middle of the room/no privacy problems)Food:The food was OK. Good vegetables, deserts, chicken etc. However, they had problems with the steak. But overall, I cant complain.. we were pleased by the food. The staff at the restaurants was amazing.Beach/pool:Nice pool, nice beach. A little bit windy but we appreciated the wind as it was 100 degrees/40 celcius outside.There is a lot of chairs at the beach and at the pool so you dont have to wake up at 7 AM every morning to go to the beach/pool before everyone else to make sure you have a chair.Bars:Nice bars and friendly barmans too. Im not a big drinker but i liked the pina colada/smirnoff/beer/rhum and coke I had.People:We met a lot of people at the Majestic. Most of them were nice.There was people from all around the world. I know there was people from Toronto, New York, Boston, St. Louis, Quebec city, Montreal, California, Florida, France, Spain and Russia. The Canadians and Americans were really nice. Europeans were OK too even though some people from Spain really seemed to think that the resort was theirs and they didnt always respect the other travelers/customers. Something i have noticed... the French Canadians were making a lot of efforts to speak english/spanish with people.. just too bad the french people from France didnt even bother trying to say an english/spanish word. I had a nice conversation about football with a Texas Longhorns fan from Quebec City, Canada. I wish I would have asked him his email so we could stay in touch.Entertainment:I was there to relax and enjoy the sun so I didnt participate to the entertainment activities. Other travelers seemed to enjoy the entertainment though.If you have any question about this resort, feel free to send me a message. I will gladly answer any question. :) fc_seminoles@hotmail.com

<Content>Beautiful Resort We had our daughter's wedding at the Majestic Colonial on March 7/08. We can not say enough good things about the resort. Aurelio the wedding coordinator went above and beyond. Everything about the resort was fabulous. The resort was clean and the food was great. The pool and beach activities we always loads of fun. We had 115 guests attend and everyone reported having a great time. We would definitely recommend a stay at the Majestic Colonial.

<Content>overall a good vacation We just came back from the Majestic colonial and overall had a great time. The public areas and the grounds in general are alltop notch and very clean. The beach was gorgeous, unfortunatelywe had a wind storm that closed the beach down for two days.This made pool space hard to find, but we managed. We were travelling with a three year old and an eight month old and foundthe staff to be helpfull in accommidating us with special requests. We had the basic standard suite, which although nice came withan odd layout. The shower and toilet were in the same room. It was big, but you had to be carefull when showering not to get the toilet all wet...strange design. I know the food had been an issue for many lately. I found thatthere was alot of variety at the main buffet. After the first two dayswe were able to figure out what best suited our tastes and we enjoyed it, especially the sweet table. Because of our small children we did not go to the french nor the japanese restos, but we did go to the steak, seafood and tainos. We liked them all and would say the tainos was our favorite. After all would you go to Tokyo to eat caribbean food. This being the D.R. the food there was the most authentic and tasty if not a little on the basic side. The other issue some were having ,was with a language barrier I found that if you have a basic knowledge of Spanish and a willingness to try you will not have any problems with service. We saw first hand many of our fellow North Americans behave rudely and demeaningly to staff for not understanding their English. A little effort and some humility can go a long way. We had one of those rooms that backed on to the construction. It was not a problem for us. Our kids have us up alot earlier than the construction workers, plus there is a felt dust fence around theperimeter that kept our area clean. Overall we had a wonderfull time and would go back to the majestic colonial.

<Content>Beautiful Place- Terrible Food Just got home yesterday (sun 23rd) . After cancelling my prior reservations at Colony Bay we choose Majestic. Arrival was without incident at 11:00 but rooms not available until 3:00 p.m. Finally checked into room 3247, It is in a wonderful location with pool and ocean views though you have a very long walk to the lobby and most restaurants which is where everything mostly is.The beach and water are beautiful with many huts but most people still reserve. It really [-] me off when people reserve a hut with towels and books and don't show up until 2-3 pm ignorant you know who you are. The pool was fantastic but chilly.There was a tropical storm in the ocean ONLY the weather remained perfect (very strange)This started on Wed and didn't let up until Fri. They had to close the beach completely on Thurs. Caution tape was tied from tree to tree not allowing any access. Unfortunately, this storm wiped out much of the beach closest to the water and many huts leaving about a 10'drop. The upper part is still fine but now a little busier. The U.S. coast guard helicopter came by Sun morning. If you have been to the D.R. before you know about that big barge that sits on a sand bar well you could not see it from the massive waves pounding it. I thought for sure it was going to become lose and smash into shore.Now the food issues, horrendous my daughter (13) is still in bed sick and it's Monday morning with massive cramping and constantly on the toliet. This started about Wed. and continued off and on the rest of the week sometimes feeling ok other times running for the T she was never right the remainder of our holiday.She is not a huge eater but loves her breakfasts and stuck to waffle's/french toast mostly but this didn't help. If she ate everything under the sun then ok this might happen. My husband 6'2 235 lbs also got sick about Wed. even though he is a big guy he sticks to the basics and doesn't try what we don't recognize. I cannot pinpoint exactly what it was but I will tell you that every single meal we had was freezing cold from the buffets to ala'cartes. The best meal was Japanese (make your res. as soon as you arrive or you wont get in they have 3 seatings.The Gourmet don't waste your time Heart of Tenderloin (filet mignon) is un edible, that could have been the culprit. I hope WHEN she wakes up she will be better. They have been living on melba toast. I on the otherhand am ok but I also have a stomach of steel. I know from experience that these things can happen with all the drinking, eating and the sun, but almost every review mentions the food issues. Take a box of melba toast with you. This was our medicine. We are well travelled and have never had worse food. This was our 5th. visit to D.R. maybe our last.

<Content>Positives outweighed the negatives Our family (my wife and I and our two teenage boys) just returned from a terrific week at the Majestic. We really had a wonderful, relaxing holiday together. We've had previous AI experiences in Mexico (Mayan Riviera) and in Cuba and our time at the Majestic was much, much better than Cuba and at least as good if not better in some ways than in Mexico.The Majestic is a lovely resort with a nice park-like feel. It's well-treed, beautifully-landscaped with an enormous pool that runs nearly the entire length of the resort. We marveled at the beauty of the place.I'll run through some of the pros and the cons of the Majestic from our perspective. First the positives. The staff are great. Almost without exception, we found the people working at the Majestic to be warm, friendly and welcoming. The attitude of the bellman who brought our bags to the room was typical. When I went to help him bring in the suitcases, he said, Let me do the work for you...you're on your vacation! As noted, the physical property is lovely. The pool was great--cool enough to be refreshing but not so cold that you didn't want to spend time in it. Lots of shade around the pool as well. The rooms were spacious and clean. We had a great view of the pool and grounds from our third-floor balcony. I would definitely not have wanted to be in any room facing the construction--loud and ugly view. But ours was fine.Overall, we found the food to be quite acceptable. The buffet breakfast was lovely--I had a made-to-order omelet several mornings and fresh squeezed orange juice that was out of this world. The cafe au lait was also great. An unbelievable variety of just about anything you could imagine was available for breakfast. A real highlight. We liked the fact that we could dine in a different restaurant every night--which we did, most without reservations. The first night we ate in the buffet and enjoyed it very much. The second night was Taino--the Mexican/Caribbean-themed restaurant. The third night, we tried the Chinese restaurant, the fourth we ate at Le Gourmet, the fifth at the seafood restaurant (ask for lobster tails that are not overdone!) the sixth at the steakhouse, and the seventh at the Japanese restaurant. All were really good. We had some minor intestinal issues a couple of days--but nothing too serious.Lovely beach--lots of shade if that's what you want but lots of sunny places too. Water sports are fine--we took out a catamaran for an hour. Unfortunately, we couldn't go out very far due to the presence of the reef--but it was fun to go back and forth parallel to the shore.There were a few negatives. Perhaps it's a North American thing, but I didn't like the toilet set-up. It's a real water closet with an opaque glass semi-door that provides little privacy with respect to sights, sounds or smells. The room had a few other quirks--for instance, our shower's drain was not located in the lowest part of the shower floor--and as a result, there was a perpetual pool of water on the shower floor--perhaps contributing to a bit of mustiness in the air.I worked out at the gym the first day--while the place had great equipment, the whole exercise room had a bad smell--like sewage. I didn't want to go back. I was also disappointed that they wouldn't allow my 14 and 16-year-old boys to work out with me--despite a sign saying the age limit was 13! When I pointed that out to the attendant, he said something along the lines that those signs should come down. He seemed to be making up the rules as he went.My son and I signed up for tennis one day--but the guy who was supposed to be manning the place where they give out balls never showed up (after telling me he would). That was a bit annoying. The court we played on was in pretty rough shape.On days that the beach was closed, it was very difficult to get chairs by the pool. We resorted to getting up really early (6:15a.m.) and saving ourselves a good spot by the pool by putting towels out. You hate to have to do that, but if you don't, you end up with no place to sit.There's not a lot to do around the resort. I golfed a couple of times--the tournament on Thursdays at Punta Blanca is a lot of fun as well as a much better deal than golfing there at other times. There's also a little place to go and shop. But other than that, the only other activities are of the paid variety, some of which required a substantial drive. We didn't mind that, however since we mostly enjoyed reading by the pool and walking on the beach. If you need to be active all the time, you may find the Majestic kind of boring.Overall, I'd say the positives outweighed the negatives quite substantially. I think if you go in with a relaxed, flexible attitude, and reasonable expectations you'll have a great time.

<Content>Fabulous Week After reading alot of bad reviews, I decided to write mine.Stayed there 2/25/02 to 3/3/08.Our check in was a breeze, Richard meet us upon arrival, made our reservations to the restraunants. Then took us to our rooms, we traveled with another couple, so we asked to be close together and again our wish was granted, our room # was 2218 on 2nd floor and our friends where right below us. The pool was right there, so every morning and night you got to see there beautiful pool. We had no problems with our rooms, everything worked fine and we had no bugs.The weather was wonderful, we loved the beach, but spent most of our time at the pool, just loved it. Had to get up early to get the better chairs, but if we didn't we still managed to find some together.The food, not one of us got sick and my husband eats almost anything right down to the goat stew. Least like the beach buffet and the Mexican all other's where fine we had more than enough selections and like I said we tried stuff we have never had some of us liked and some didn't, all people are different, if your picky might not be the place for you.As far as comminication, we brush up on some basic spanish which helped we never had a problem, a big smile goes along way, we tipped not sure we even had too, but it help we never wait long for drinks with a few dollars out.We didn't do any actives on the property so can't say much about that. Did see a couple of shows, not bad have seen better. Hit the casino a few nights, had some luck playing Rolette even took home some of there money, did better there than in Vegas.The reason for the trip was to get away from a cold snowy winter in New Enland and just relax. Would we go again, yes, this was my 3rd visit to DR, 2nd in Punta Cana.

<Content>Wedding at the Majestic Just a few words to describe our wedding at the Majestic.The Majestic was my 9th resort (ranging from 3 1/2 to 5 stars, Cuba, DR and Mexico). It was the first experience for my Wife. We were accompagnied by 40 guests.Overall, everyone was very satisfied with the trip.Pros : Almost everything. I do not unserstand why people complain about the food? The food wasn't always excellent, but it was always really good, never terrible. Beach and pool are amazing. Nice rooms. Service was good (some people don't seem to understand that you are in their (service staff) country, understanding their language and being polite goes a long way, something Canadians seem to agree on). Animation was excellent, but the resort is more for teenagers and adult. Our wedding was GREAT. Larissa is patient, organized. We were worried about meeting her only the day before, but everything turned out AWESOME.Cons : Rooms a little bit more humid (and musty), compared to what I've experienced before. But that seemed to be more in building 3 and 4 (also, building 4 has a view of a construction site). Also, for a five star, there should be more than 1 beach concierge / waiter.Overall, this resort is more ilke a very good 4 star, than a 5 star.

<Content>Outstanding Pool  Returned this week from a glorious vacation at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. After reading many conflicting opinions about this resort, we were not sure what to expect, but we were delighted and thrilled by our experience. The weather was perfect, and the accommodations very comfortable. We were in a standard junior suite, and my only comment is that the bedding and linens could have been much nicer. The mattress was quite inferior, and the pillows lumpy and most uncomfortable. Sheets were adequate, but not very soft on sunburned skin. There were always plenty of towels, however, and even wash cloths on some days. The shower, however, was fantastic!! Large enough for four people, with great water pressure and water temperature. So maybe one thing makes up for the other. The two restaurants I would recommend are Le Gourmet and Matsuri. Le Gourmet was an island of elegance in the midst of vacation frivolity. Be sure to try the tenderloin and the creme brulee with rum sauce and the meringue dessert with chocolate sauce. Delicious!! The food at Matsuri was delicious and it was a great opportunity to visit with other guests, but neither our chef or his assistant could converse in English, and it was a bit awkward.The most memorable aspect of our trip will surely be the Animation Team- Rey, Leo, Samuel, Lina, Sandy, and Melvin. We saw them from 9am at the pool until after the evening show late at night. They never failed to greet us with hugs and smiles. They encouraged us to engage in pool activities and we looked for them wherever we went! Rey in particular was always genuinely happy to see us, and was always cheerful. Our interaction with these charming gentlemen with always be a very special part of our vacation.

<Content>Great service overall, but... Just returned from Majestic Colonial resort, Punta Cana. Not having been to the region prior, nor knowing anyone who had, we had no idea what to expect. I believe this contributed to some sense of disappointment with this trip. The grounds are beautiful, the place is immaculately clean. The employees are busy, busy, bees... always cleaning, sweeping, replacing, doing their best to maintain everything and they will do everything to attempt to satisfy your needs. The selling point of the resort seems to be the fact that it is all-inclusive; all one can eat and especially drink.The problem for us was 1) the food was terrible, 'tho there was always great effort to present it attractively, and 2) not being heavy drinkers we found little to do other than lounge by the pool . Because of weather conditions (of course the resort had no control over the storm which kept everyone off the beach for two days) the pool area was quite crowded and short of lounging chairs. Not being near even a small city shopping area we never saw much of the life of the country. We did take the one day trip to the Island for beach and BBQ. This trip was nice, but way too long. It was a 2-hr bus ride to the marina where we boarded a catamaran. Following our time on the beach we had another looong return ride to the hotel. Whew!Families with small children seemed to have a good time with the youngsters being able to plop around the pool; and certainly the hearty drinkers enjoyed the never empty glass of whatever it was they wanted to drink. My advice then, would be to take a good book or two, snag a lounge chair, just relax, read, and drink up. For us, it just wasn't enough.

<Content>Too Bad the Majestic Spoiled an Otherwise Good Vacation I intentionally waited 8 days to write this review to allow the resort's senior manager (Oscar Ramirez) the opportunity to address our concerns. Mr. Ramirez had promised to discuss our concerns with the resort's manager that day and contact us personally get back to us immediately to discuss what the resort could offer as compensation for our inconveniences as he called them. Well, we have yet to hear from Mr. Ramirez and I doubt that we ever will. Consistent with our week at this resort, this was likely just another empty promise hoping that we would just go away.We have and intend to stay away from this resort or any Majestic resort for that matter.On the positive, the beach and weather in Punta Cana are outstanding. We will likely be back but not at this resort.Here are my comments:ROOMS: We were first put in a room facing a construction site for the new hotel. Room 4120. Looking at a Dominican Republic construction site at a supposedly 5 star hotel is not my idea of a vacation. If you are assigned a room with the number starting with a 4, I recommend that you immediately demand another room. All room numbers starting with 4 face the construction site. They did move us to another room with an excellent view of the pool. Unfortunately, the air conditioner leaked leaving us to walk on wet marble floors every night. Secondly, the power went off 3 times in our room leaving us with no lights or air conditioning and needing to chase hotel staff to get it turned on again.FOOD: The food is average at best. We've travelled enough and this was the worse buffets we've seen to date. The steak house on the beach was probably the best but average. Our travel representative actually recommended that we DON'T eat at Le Gourmet, their top end restaurant. Apparently, 10 travellers over 2 weeks prior to our arrival had been hospitalized for gastro-intestinal problems after eating at Le Gourmet. Obviously, we didn't chance it. Be quick to make reservations for the Japanese restaurant because when we tried to book on our second day there, the only opening was on the Wednesday at 9:30 PM, two days before leaving.SERVICE (Lack of): Service was our biggest issue. It really doesn't matter whether you tip or not, the service does not change. The same behaviour was encountered in most area including the maid, the bartenders, etc. I guess that $2.00 to $5.00 tips are not sufficient. Some restaurant staff did provide very good service.Our biggest problem came after our 14 year old daughter was not allowed to participate in beach and pool volleyball events on 3 separate occasions. I know she's a bit small for her age but other kids that she had befriended and were 2 years younger than her were allowed to play. After I questioned the captain of the animation team, he accused me of lying to him about her age and walked away. Only after my wife went to complain at the front desk and that the animation manager was on his way to resolve this issue that this individual began backpedalling. The animation team member who would not allow our daughter to play (same guy all 3 times) responded with arrogant rudeness when my wife informed him that the animation manager had specifically instructed them to allow my daughter to play.I truly believe that the animation team's role is to girate their crotches disguised as entertainment for as many women as possible at this resort. Don't get me wrong, I really don't care but this behaviour is blatant everywhere the animation team goes. My daughter's 12 year old friend was actually hit on by a waiter at lunch so keep an eye on your kids/teenagers.Getting anything resolved took many trips to the front desk with empty promises, etc. culminating with a senior manager committing to contact us to resolve who we've never heard from since. I estimate that we wasted about 1 full day trying to get some service and issues resolved. Hotel management does not appear to be interested in customer service which is strange for the resort business. I'm not surprised that this hotel has dropped from #1 to #3 in Punta Cana and I'm certain that it's rating continues to fall.ENTERTAINMENT: Average lip sync shows. The Michael Jackson show is propbably the best. Pool and beach entertainment is often the same and lacks imagination.In closing, I will say that other guests were satisfied with the hotel however others also had significant issues. Maybe it's like a lottery. If you're lucky, everything will go well and you'll be pleased...........

<Content>Bacon Garbage This was possible the worst food experience I have ever had. Absolutely awful. One of the items on the buffet(which is by the way your only option for breakfast and lunch) was actually labeled Bacon Garbage, use this as an indicator for the entire dining experience. Also, the drinks were awful. Only the worst well liquor out there was available(**you could get stoli and JW red at the hotel upstairs lobby bar only), the wines were horrendous, and your only beer option was Presidente. Frozen drinks, while you had several different color options, all had the same pina colada taste and they were unable to figure our how to successfully add rum to it.While the grounds, beach and pool area were beautiful, not one of the pool hot tubs was actually hot. We were very disappointed overall and would not recommend the Majestic.

<Content>a great week with royal service we came back from our week at the Majectic in the middle of one of the worst snow storms this year... but the week we spent at the Majestic in Punta Cana was fantastic. The staff is very friendly and professional. The food is fantastic... Rooms are nice and bright, clean and confortable. Service over and above!the week was everything we expected and then some!we look forward to going back ; and hopefully the weather will be better... we did get quite a bit of cloud and rain but that was out of everyones control and does not change the fact that we had a GREAT week.

<Content>wedding pains. Over all the majestic was great! A five star im not sure you could say that. Our group of 23 arrived at 900pm for most the check in was good For myself, Husband and our girls were escortted to our rooms and given a tour on the way. When we all got checked in we were all very hungry. Try and find a place to eat!! heaven for bid there be one of the 7 rest. open. the only one that was some what available was the mediterainan that was in the process of shutting down. we tried to eat but what was there was gross. and the sports bar / Disco did not open till 11pm. (1 pet peave) The whole property is absolutly georges. The grounds are very well maintained, and clean.The room on first inspection is very beautiful. everything very clean. however on closer inspection while in the shower the ceiling is a false one, with holes in it, you could look up and see the wires. which is a little creepy. i have a wicked imagination!!!. the grout in between the tiles needs to be replaced before mold sets in. and the bed left something to be desired. it was better then some but i geuss nothing is as good as your own. When it came to the cleaning staff they rip your room apart to clean under the bed and such to make sure they get all the sand out and clean sheets everyday and towels but they do not clean your tub or sinks or your tolet daily. we stayed for two weeks. we were in our room serveral times when they came in. they wipe the counters and clean your bed Sweep and mop the floors. it wasnt a big deal with the shower and toilet but with the tub its a little gross exspecialy when you have suntan lotion on and when you get out there's a ring around the tub. yuck!!! The mini bar deffinatly left something to be desired. They only stock it once and will not restock it. you would have to call room service and pay for what ever you wanted. overall the room was just fine. The foodWe really enjoyed the main buffet for all of our meals. Although they had some pretty weird stuff. They had they most amazing burgers, homemade patties and thourghly cooked. and sausage lasguna very good.The chinesse was very good the first time we went back for the second and it was ok the third time pretty gross. The jappaness. Holy crap!!! soooooo very good the best meal ever! Book it as soon as you get there and if you have a group try to book it before you leave. only two tables of ten with four reservation timesThe steak house was alright , the seafood was not so good depending on what you ordered. The mediterainina we didn't try it except for the first night.The beach buffet was alright as well somethings in there needed some improvements but if all else fails go for the pasta bowls.The gourmet. I shouldn't even comment. The biggest waist of time except for the pumkin soup. To die for. outside of the soup i would have starved. Two of our geusts didn't even eat the left and went to the buffet.The service is not that of a five star hotel and the staff are not that friendly exspecial at the bars. The female staff seemed to be much better. However it may be due to the lack of ability in speaking english.The drinks are a litlle sketchy. very very strong. there were several drinks in our group that were aboandond. A little advise. If you get a good drink make sure you go back to the same bar tender.The pool service is none, I have never been to a resort where there wasn't a waiter or waitress. and you can not take food out to the pool or to the beach. must be consumed in the restarant. (pet peave 2) No snack bar only restarants (pet peave 3)The SpaWas ok.Definatly not set up for everything they offer.Myself and my two bridesmaids had a spa day. a massage and fascial and pedicure. and the two girs had facials and pedis and maicures. when i came into the room for my pedicure. my one girl was sitting in a regular chair with her feet in a spa tub like we have at home and getting her maincure done. my other brides made and myself had to sit in the wash chairs where you get your hair washed and put our feet in a spa tub. not comfy at all. exspecially when the first girl had to raise her leg above her hip level to put it in the girls lap so she could do the pedi.The showsNot my style, We were told that the micheal jackson was the must see show. My whole group got up and walked out after the jackson five part was over.I enjoyed most of what the call ballet (not even close) but it was good.If you want just a basic wedding with no private dinner then you will be fine. other wise a private dinner is 65.00 per person and 45.00 per person for a bartender. there are no flowers set up for you they just use their garden which is nice but not what i exspected. and the palm fraun arch way is plastic.The communication with the coordinator was sketchy she always returned the email but never answered all the qeustions It took my travel agent contacting someone hire up to get the answers i needed. In the end i cancelled there and had the cerimony and the dinner at the Jellyfish restarant. Absolutly amazing. I went in to meet them the second day i was in PC and they were amazing people. ready to help you with everything and anything. They gave me a menu to take back to the resort and everyone was able to order what they wanted for dinner. And they supplied our photographer. Everything when off without a hitch. on only three emails and one meeting.Three different appatizers 6 each23 meals a huge beautiful cakeand flowers cost less then what the resort wanted to charge me 1500.00.

<Content>Enjoyed the Majestic We enjoyed our week March 13-20 at the Majestic. We went with 2 other couples, our 2 children 11 and 13, and another 13 year old. The rooms were large and clean. We had 2 doubles, and they put a single bed in the room so our daughters could both have their own beds. ( we did not ask for this, it was done by the resort , and it was a nice surprise) Our beds were made daily by 10:00 am, our towels changed and most days we arrived back to our rooms after the 10:00pm show to find that our towels were again changed for fresh ones. Our mini bar was replenished with water every day, we did not use the pop that was supplied, but expect that would have been replinished. We stayed in Building 3 on the 2nd floor and we were very happy with the location of the room, midway from the lobby area, and the beach area. The food was average. The breakfast buffet had a good choice of food. You could have fresh eggs, omelletes made to your liking, or choose from pancakes,waffles,crepes. There were also a variety of cereals to have, fresh fruit, yogurt. There were cold cuts and cheese, and a variety of sausages, bacon, and other warm items. There were fruit smoothies and juices. Certainly not a problem finding something for every taste!!Lunch in the Buffet was also much of the same. You could have fresh pasta cooked , hambergers cooked. There were potatoes, french fries, vegetables, salad, fish fried chicken, breaded chicken. We tried the Palapa hut for lunch one day and were very disappointed in the variety of food offered. They did have fresh pasta, but not alot of variety in the other choices.Dinners went from average at the Carribean/Mexican Restaurant and the Chinese Restaurant, to very good at the Japenese demostration Dinner and the Gourmet Restaurant. The Rodeo Grill was very good one night, especially the Chateubriand , but the second night we tried the Rodeo the food was not prepared as well. We did not try the Buffet for Dinner. The bars by the pool areas served your basic drinks, and depending on the wait staff were not always made the same. Pool service was on and off, not consistent. We usually swam down to the bar, or walked to one of the 3 bars. When you ask for a Majestic, Daquiri, Pina Colada if you want alcohol make sure you tell them, alot of times they would just give it to you without adding the alcohol, no big deal, just ask.We didn't have to fight for chairs by the pool, there were plenty, even for our party of 9, we never had a problem. The last day we were at the Resort there were very rough waves, the beach area was closed, so the pool area was very crowed and it was hard to get chairs by the pool. But that certainly was not the norm. The Lobby bars were good, both upsatirs and in the area by the Restaurants. There was always music in the square and you could sit and have drinks out there as well.The nightly shows were hit and miss. Some were just fun to watch and others were very cheesy.The pool is very refreshing on a hot day, and never felt crowded because of it's size. Always something going on by the main pool bar area, but there are alot of quite areas that you could just lounge in and not be disturbed. The kids enjoyed boogey boarding and sea kayaking, included in our package. They went banana boating and para Sailing which we paid for at the diving /aqautic center.Overall we had a great time at the Majestic.

<Content>Majestic, Great Vacation! March 8,we left Montreal just before the storm hit.We lucked out.Got to the airport in the DR and it was a breeze getting through.Neat looking airport.They told us the Majestic was full and we had stay the first day and night at the Bahia Ambar next door.Very nice place,but the Bahia is big.Sunday we got to the Majestic and after a bit of confusion at the front desk We got our rooms.We were upgraded to the rooms with the outdoor hottubs,given a free 30 minute massage anytime during the week and each got 100.00 toward an excurtion as compensation for the overbooking .We liked the Majestic a lot. After reading a lot of bad things about the food,we were kind of worried.We thought the buffets were very good ever day.We ate at the Steak house and loved it,the Taino restaurant was very good ,as well as the Le Gourmet. All very good. The rooms were very nice ,cleaned every day.Cold water and beer everyday in our fridge.The resort is constantly being cleaned ,it is beautiful. The pool is huge and spottless.We didnt get to see the nightly shows except part of Michael Jackson show. We didnt visit the disco,too tired after too many beers all day in the hot sun.The beach is really great . picture perfect.Water was kind of rough but still great. We did the all day Catamaran snorkling trip ,that was fun.Overall there were not enough hours in the day to take in everything. We love the Majestic. Pat

<Content>Perfect resort We stayed at Majestic Colonial for 2 weeks and loved it.Our room (colonial juniorsuite) was beautiful, the food great and the personel very nice and dedicated. We loved the animationteam (especially Sandy, Jes煤s and Francisco). Some of the games: woodshooting, darts, eggtossing, bikinicontest and of course beach- and poolvolley. They are not pushy but a lot of fun and very nice. We hope to see them back.The shows in the theatre are great, just like the beach and the pool.Well worth your money!

<Content>Clean Resort - Great Time 2/18 - 2/26 Went to the Majestic on my honeymoon for 8 nights. This resort is very new and it shows since nothing is out of date. We would always start our day off with a light breakfast then we would head down to the beach. The beach was unreal, with plenty of shade and a nice constant breeze. Lunch around 2 at the buffet or paplula hut. After that I would either go back to the beach or hang out in the pool at the wet bar with Victor the bar tender. Victor's great. He is always having a good time and does his best to make sure that you will as well. Not to mention the fact that he gets you a new drink before your even finished with the one you got.The entertainment team shows up at the pool later in the day and gets people involved. Ray from the entertainment team was great. He was very friendly and helpfull. When we would be walking around the resort at night he would come over and say hello to my wife and I. Hope to see you next year Ray!Likes: Resort Staff (Victor  Ray), Clean rooms / resort, great beach.Dislikes: Presedente BeerThanks to all that made our time spent at the Majestic a long and lasting wonderfull memory.

<Content>Wonderful resort I just returned from a spectacular vacation to Punta Cana from March 12 - March 16 and stayed at the Majestic Colonial. Everything was simply great!! The hotel is absolutely beautiful and you always see the grounds staff working on the property. My room was on the first floor very close to the beach which was very convenient. My room was a standard room and was huge as they all are at this hotel. The in-room safe (at no extra charge) was terrific along with the daily stocking of the refrigerator that contained bottled water, soda and beer. Even the bath towels were great - nice and roomy!! There is a new Majestic Elegance being built next door but I never heard any construction noise. The staff at the Majestic was extremely friendly and helpful. I want to give special thanks to Denny (the beach concierge), Lucy (who worked at the Caraibbean Shops at the hotel) and Janet (who worked at the front desk). They all were extremely helpful and I truly enjoyed my conversations with all three!! I took this vacation alone and felt extremely comfortable there. I only ate at the Buffet and I thought it was great. There were huge selections to choose from and I liked the fact that I could go in, sit down and eat right away. The beach was just elegant - the nicest I have been to in the Caribbean. Weather was sunny every day. The weather websites that I checked prior to my trip always said that the weather was partly cloudy but the only clouds I saw were puffy, fair weather clouds that rarely interfered with the sunshine. I read some of the negative reviews prior to my trip and I find them hard to believe as my trip was flawless. I think that some people would complain even if they had a free vacation!! I am already in the process of deciding when I can go back next year. My only regret is that my trip was too short!! If anyone has any questions, I will gladly answer them.

<Content>Beautiful but... Absolutely beautiful resort!!!! Very large beach, amazing pool that runs the length of the resort, ample cabanas and lounge chairs for guests. My first impression: STUNNING!!Go to my room, everything is gorgeous. Everything marble. Bed was comfortable, bathing areas private enough. Did have one maintenance problem which was solved very quickly. I really only have two complaints, food and customer service. There was a huge selection of food, yes. But that entire selection of food was absolutely disgusting, not to mention unsanitary. Very surprised that I did not get sick by the end of my trip. On to customer service... The language barrier here is pretty bad, and I think that this is mostly the downfall of the customer service side. Looking back at everything, it was a lovely trip, but I starved for a week!

<Content>Exceeds Expectations If this resort does not exceed your expectations, what exactly are your expectations? In my opinion there are a certain group of travelers that will never be pleased regardless of the resort or efforts of staff.You know who they are, unfortunately they do not recognize this quality in themselves, so will write extremely negative reviews when really the only problem was themselves.Do you know the type of person I am referring to ? Here are a few hints; won't say good morning to other guests, rude to staff, even on the first approach, look for something to complain about instead of looking for something to enjoy... you get the picture, be sympathetic, they don't realize what a good time they are missing out on. And no, they don't receive top notch service... would you bend over backwards for them, or would you save this for the friendly guests?Anyway, on to my review of the Majestic. I have worked for a number of years in the hospitality industry and have a great appreciation for great service and a great facility, we found both at the Majestic.Upon check-in we were greeted and welcomed to the resort - cold towels were provided to the guys while we checked in... the girls had already made their way to the lobby bar.We were traveling with another couple. Our room was ready when we arrived, our friends room was still being cleaned(we arrived 2 hours before check-in time. This was not a problem, rooms were side by side as requested, we went to lunch and their room was ready afterward.Rooms were very clean, spacious, comfortable, pretty much perfect. I can see the bathroom (glass door at toilet stall) could be an issue for couples that have only been together s short time, it wasn't a problem for us. There is also the opportunity to step out on the balcony for a minute to provide your partner with some privacy. Showers were excellent, big enough for two (wink)Our room was cleaned very well every day and almost always when we were still at the beach. The only exception was one day it was cleaned at about 6pm, but you could see it was a heavy check-in/out day at the resort, so we grabbed a deck of cards and spent some extra time at the pool bar (life is a *itch ain't it).We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. We visited every restaurant except for LeGourmet (our choice, we just couldn't be bothered putting on pants, LOL). There was great selection, the buffet is huge and has multiple pasts stations. This resort knows how to deal with full capacity. It was fully booked the week we were there, yet there were no line ups, no lack of seating, and no lack of service. My wife is a picky eater and had no complaints about the food the entire week. The steak restaurant was definitely my favorite, we went there twice. Last year we stayed at the Punta Cana Princess resort, the food at the Majestic was better and we were not unhappy at the PCP. The Majestic is a much larger resort and has the ability to provide larger variety...Beach / Pool. We are definitely beach people, it is our preference and primary reason for traveling. If you have ever been to Punta Cana, you already know that the beach is fantastic. For the Majestic's section of beach there is one small section where there are a few rocks (this is the ocean remember) it is about 30 metres left of the volleyball net. if it bothers you go to a different section and you will not have a problem. The Majestic'c section of beach is huge, there is a lot of choice in where you decide to throw down your towel.The week we were there it was pretty windy (more then usual for PC) so we ended up pool side a couple of times. The pool really is amazing, how on earth they maintain such a huge pool I have no idea. The water is sparkling clean every day - wow. There was one day we found the water a little nippy, so swam in the ocean instead.The beach chair game.... I can't believe it, we didn't have to play the game. Even though the hotel was full, there were still plenty of chairs/ umbrella's available - even when we didn't get to the beach until 9ish some days. There are literally a ton of chairs and umbrellas, both at the beach and pool. Superb planning.Towels, two locations to refresh your beach towels - one at the beach, one at the pool. I have no clue why anyone would have issue with not being able to get a towel, I guess see comment at the beginning(lol)What more can be said about this hotel? we had a completely problem free stay, not a single complaint, staff were wonderful, shows were pretty good (circus show was our favorite) disco - was pretty good etc etc. Activities staff were excellent, encouraged participation but were not pushy about it, they really seem to enjoy their job.If you stay at this resort and end up frustrated with anything... perhaps it's not the resort at all. Treat people the way you want to be treated, the staff here deals with thousands of guests day in day out, how do you think they will react if your a pain in the [--] to them?We highly recommend the Majestic, Enjoy.Cannot wait to get back to Punta Cana - great vacation.

<Content>Beautiful Beach with coral reef for snorkling Returned Sat from the Majestic Colonial. We had a fabulous time and the beach is beautiful! I was very scared to go with all the negative reviews. We requested connecting rooms but not available until the next day. Stayed in building 3 with pool/ocean view. This was a great location. The ride to the hotel was horrible. I thought my kids were going to get sick. When we arrived we were greeted with cool towel and drink. The rooms were clean and very spacious. The layout with the bathroom was odd. There is not a whole lot of privacy. The shower was great. Mini bar was stocked everyday and would bring us anything if we needed it before the next day. My kids loved the orange soda and chocolate bars. Never had a problem getting a chair at the pool or beach. The beach was our favorite thing. There is a coral reef inside the roped area with tons of tropical fish. My kids loved snorkeling there everyday. You do not need to leave the resort to go snorkeling or go to deep waters. Some resorts do not have this. The pool was wonderful and very clean. The entire staff at the Majestic was so nice. Always saying hello and getting us what we needed. The grounds are beautiful and so well manicured. We took the catamaran out several times. My kids did the tubing and banana boats and loved it. There is a game room that the whole family enjoyed- ping pong, pool . It is a covered area outside. Did not use the kids club. Went there a few times and they were always watching a movie. Staffed seemed very nice. I did not go the resort for the food. It wasn't horrible but not my favorite. We found plenty of food that we did like but after a few days it was all blah. The fresh fruit was wonderful and also the ice cream. Our favorite restaurant was the steak. We went there 3 times and every time we had a super meal. THe service everywhere was fantastic! No one got sick while we were on our trip. I was really scared of this. We used purell all the time especially after we served ourselves from the buffet. Everyone touches the same utinsels. I saw one lady cough in her hand and then pick up the untinsel to server her food. Flies are all over the food out by the beach. After a few days I just ignored it. I would go back to the Majestic even though I thought the food was okay. We went to several show and really enjoyed them. We had a great time at the Majestic. We loved the photographers that come around with the animals. We bought several photos. It was fun to also watch the weddings. It is a great place.

<Content>We want to go back!! We just returned from 6 days at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. I can not say enough positive things about this resort. It is gorgeous. The pool spans the entire length of the property and is designed to resemble a river. Bridges cross at various points, there are inlets to larger swimming areas and there is a pool bar as well. The resort houses many people yet it never seems crowded because there is so much area for people to spread out. The beach was beautiful, of course. The staff was fantastic! They were more than accomodating. I did not run into one staff member who was anything less than professional. We particularly enjoyed the Animation team. This is a group of people who organize programs  activities. My husband and I learned new dances and had fun competing in contests by the pool. Much thanks to Linia, Samuel, Rey, Jesus, Ivellise, Melvin, Jipeeta, Pablo, Sandy  Francisco. You guys are great! The food was very good as well. We never got bored with it and always felt that there were many options available. We would both highly recommend the Majestic. We plan to return again next year. 2 Tourists from Chilly Pennsylvania

<Content>Very Good, but with 16 friends We have just returned from a week at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such huge amount and quality of food before. Service was not bad also, but some problems with English/Spanish communications happen pretty often. We came like big group of 16 friends from different cities and this was perfect place to spent time together.My wife  I stayed on simple room with garden view and all inclusive packages. The territory and pools are lovely. We loved to walk around a lot. The Spa with sauna is Ok, Restaurants are great. Only discomfort happened in French restaurant when they refused to make for us one common table for 16 person and we sited separately by 4-6 persons per tableRoom with king size bed and Jacuzzi is nice, but humidity was high. Sometimes water condensed on stone floor and it was slippery. Overall I would say this is probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed.

<Content>10 Great Days at Majestic My wife and I stayed at the Majestic from Feb 27-Mar 7th.All I can really say is don't believe everything you read.When you arrive ask to see Victor Pollantis he is the front desk manager he speaks excellent english.Victor is the man and he will take care of you.We have been to DR 3 times now and this resort is the nicest family resort we have been too..All the resorts have the same problem with english speaking employees but hey you are in the DR the speak spanish everyone is very polite and they will make an effort there are people from all over the world at this resort.If you can't find something good to eat here then there is something wrong with you.There is 1200plus people and the are trying to make everyone happy.If you want a good burger and fries stay home.We ate at every place except the Japanese all the food was great and we never got sick.I had heartburn one day but I stopped drinking so much coffee,and problem solved.This resort is every good review you have read,plus it has one more exceptional person.Down at the steakhouse bar there is a bartender named Amuary he topped off our great stay and speaks excellent english.Stop in and see him make sure you tell him that Eric and Veronica say hello.Enjoy your stay and don't forget to tip the help they work there butt off for you.

<Content>Five Star - you bet! March 7-14: Arrived around noon -- told our room would be ready in 20 minutes. Had lunch, went back and room was ready. Room was oceanfront with huge terrace -- nicely appointed and very clean. This resort lives up to its five star rating. The accommodations are excellent and the resort itself is beautiful and not so huge you feel lost. Reservations are required at only two a la carte restaurants (Gourmet and for Teppanyaki) the food was very good to excellent 鈥?some of the 鈥渉ot鈥?dishes in the buffet could be kept warmer. My spouse is vegetarian, and they were always able to accommodate her needs. The beach is superb, but the water is rough (with undertow) so I would closely supervise younger children. Language is not at issue at all 鈥?we do not speak Spanish (other than the few tourist phrases) and never had any problems. The staff is VERY friendly and helpful 鈥? they do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable 鈥? especially Jesus and Nelson at the Rodeo Grill, and Denny the beach waiter/concierge was the best! Service here is top notch. This was our 5th trip to the DR (all 5 star resorts) and this was the best. If the Majestic does not meet your expectations, stay home.

<Content>a transformation My trip to Punta Cana was a vacation of a life time. The staff of the Majestic Colonial made every moment an extraordinary experience. I would highly recommend a visit to this magical paradise. I would like to extend my special thanks to Ray, Leo, Lina, Jesus and Sandy of the animation team, for making myself and my family feel very welcome and special!!! They are a group of very talented individuals who work very hard without making it look like work. You can really tell they enjoy what they do. Thank you with all my heart for a wonderful vacation. God bless you. Teal and Kiri

<Content>Loved the Majestic One of the best vacations we have had!Stayed Feb 25 to March 03 2008We had room 2118 and our friends had 2218 right above us. We received the swim-up room and it was awesome I loved the Jacuzzi on the patio.The pool, beach and the grounds are beautiful. We always found good to great food to eat and not one of the 4 of us ever got sick. Just to let you know I ate a salad with my meals.Went to the shows at night and they were very goodRemember your not in Las Vegas paying 200.00 to see a show. They work very hard!The most important thing I want to say is the people that work at this resort are the hardest working friendlist I have seen so far. Thank-you all for making our vacation wonderful. Kudos to everybody there. Especially Richard and Mario.Linda

<Content>Top Notch All The Way! We just returned from a week of pure paradise at the Majestic. The pool area, beach, cabanas  number of lounge chairs available, was by far the best along the coastline. The room was VERY spacious and clean and the entire resort was nothing short of spotless. We thoroughly enjoyed the wide selection of food (I believe my husband tried nearly everything available) and found the service to be extremely friendly and efficient. Comments were made by other people that the staff had obviously been very well trained as they were so attentive  accommodating. The entertainment in the main area was better than most other resorts we have been to with the best being the Saxaphone/piano jazz duo playing outside every night. We were even lucky enough to hear a jazz singer from New Orleans who happened to be on vacation. Several guests, including ourselves, mentioned that it isn't often you find a Resort you want to return to, but the Majestic had us all eager to re-book in the near future. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Majestic and will enthusiastically recommend it to others; just as it had been highly recommended to us.

<Content>read on.... We just returned (a group of six, over middle agers) from a beautiful resort. We stayed 10 days.The reception with its drinks and cold cloths was as described. I had e-mailed to request for our group to be in the same area and this was done. We were poolside, in the 200 block. The room was spotless and the bed had a pillow like top. I had no problem with noise at night. Some of our friends had trouble getting facecloths but we had plenty. The bathroom set up is not as bad as it sounds in the reviews. Our majestic suite allowed for room service and that was prompt. The mini bar was well stocked. I brought my laptop and bought internet service for the room ($10. daily) it had its problems but staff were responsive, even having a tech person (Carlos) come to the room to trouble shoot. At check out, after discussion of internet problems, two days charges were deleted. The pool was beautiful.There were quiet areas and the more active areas with the animation team. I went to a yoga class and spanish lessons. Lots of available fun. A great photo opportunity is available with the visiting animals. There is Maria, a huge iguana (lovely) and Milly, a funny little monkey. I chose not to pose with the parrots but I regret missing the huge blond cobra.. Photos are reasonable at 10. for a nice shot. The beach was beautiful. You can walk from one resort to another (Majestic seems the best),there is plenty of shade and the water was fun.I went to the spa twice, and that should tell you I was pleased. Staff were fine, most of them sweet, funny and kind. English is fluent with mostly management, but you can still work it out. The saff work incredible long hours and you get to see the same faces in different places. I tip, and a lot of this staff deserves a little extra. The drinks in the lobby bars were the best as written so many times. There was nice music up until 10 pm. Then the show starts. I enjoyed Michael Jackson but friends said the other shows were lame.Despite all of this I would not go back to this resort. The food was unacceptable.. Considering the quality of the other services ,this is a shame. I am not picky and I have no digestive problems. But I was sick several days while on vacation as was another member of the group. I am aware of the differences in food handling techniques but I observed many lapses in sanitation from staff and......visitors! Additionally food was not tasty. Often it was not hot or it was dry, tough or heavily salted. Service at the Chinese area of the Japanese restaurent was beyond poor. And the food quality was inconsistant. One night the food was good. We were so happy, even if there was an hour wait for the entree! a few nights later the same dish was inedible and we all left mid meal and went to the buffet. The pasta and pizza at the buffet are great. The breakfast is good. The bread is great. That still leaves a lot of meals to fill. The gourmet restaurant was alright one night, not good another. The steakhouse (an open restaurant with flys) was frantic with many people waiting and general confusion. The food was alright but I would not suggest eating from the open salad and desert bars. Part of our group ate at the fish reataurant and it was inedible. we walked through the Caribbean restaurant and chose not to eat there.I don't go to the islands for gourmet food and I have been to many all inclusives. This resort needs to address its issues with its dietary service.

<Content>Great hotel... loved it!!! Stop paying attention to the negatives reviews... We were a group of 6 traveling to this hotel from the 1st through the 8th of march. We only have great comments to say about this resort and so did all of the friends that we met there. The service is great, the rooms are beautiful and very clean, the food is excellent. The beach and the pool... wow!!! It's paradise on earth! The staff is very friendly and nice. They were always more than happy to answer our questions or make sure that we were ok. A special thanks to he animation team... Melvin, Jesus, Leo, Samuel, Ivelise, Lina, Martires, Francisco, Rei and Sandy,Thank you guys for the great week !!!! You guys are amazing!Would I recommend this resort? Absolutely! In fact, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to go back there in the future.

<Content>A great vacation! We truly enjoyed our stay at this resort. The staff was courteous and helpful, especially the Guest Services desk, where Anyela did an excellent job of helping us with various requests. The resort is beautiful, with a gorgeous white sand beach and beautiful swimming pool that runs throughout the complex. It is very clean and not too crowded, you can usually get a beach or pool chair and always a seat at the restaurant of your choice. The lobby especially is gorgeous, especially the lobby bar, framed by a sweeping central staircase and open-air, with fountains on either side. It really does feel like paradise.The food was good, but not great (although I don't usually expect it to be great at all-inclusives). The reason we came to this location was for sun, comfort and relaxation, and this resort delivers on all three counts. Our room was lovely, with a gorgeous four-poster bed and marble floors. The shower was fabulous, great pressure and it's a lovely rainshower which is so relaxing. There was a hint of mustiness that others had mentioned but that happens in any humid climate. I had brought a candle and an air freshener and we were just fine.Overall a wonderful, relaxing visit. If I didn't have a rule not to go anywhere twice, we would go back.

<Content>Fabulous Vacation!!!! We visited Majestic Colonial on March 1-8. Our entire experience was excellent. We did not have ONE complaint. We constantly saw maintenance working. The food was abundant and fresh. We ate the foods we were accustomed to and had no stomach issues. The shows were entertaining. The people are VERY friendly and helpful. Some did not understand english, but Hello! we were in another country. We went with our dearest of friends, who had never been to DR and they were impressed. It was a true RR holiday. Can't wait to return.

<Content>Majestic was perfect My wife and I Just returned from the Majestic. Out stay was Saturday the 1st to Saturday the 8th of March. I need to say it was one of our best vacations. Cheap caribiean was awesome to deal with. Mario is a rep who sits on site at the Majestic for them and he was a huge help with excursions.About the Majestic, Facilities - Spotless. Never saw any mess anywhere. Bathrooms in the lobbies where clean all the time. Only once did I notice the bathroom in buffet room was missing hand towels and the hand dryer did not work. Bars and general seating areas where constantly picked up. Nothing ever piled up. Food -was really good, except for the hamburgers. It's a different country so things will be different, we just couldn't get beyond the hamburgers. Everything else was awesome. What a selection in the buffet! We also ate in all the res truants and we liked all of them. The best was the Japanese steak house.Beach - Well maintained. Plenty of chairs. Water seems to be constantly rough. Good for adults, not for seniors and kids.Pool - Very clean, not heated was a bit cold but most people adjusted very quickly. Plenty of chairs around the pool. No dedicated adults only area. Wish there had been to keep some separation between kids and adults who would prefer not having kids around. Hot tubs, Sona and Steam rooms you have to enter via the spa. Most people didn't realize this, it's a nice area and this is the only kid free zone. There are signs clearly posted but some parents are illiterate or just stupid.Rooms - Excellent, We stayed in 3343 (bldg 3, 3rd floor, room 43) I will say, make sure your room is not near a staircase. It's very noisy as people are returning from late night activities and a drunk or feeling well and doing things like singing, screaming, talking/yelling, etc..Staff - Richard was awesome!! He gave us a tour of the hotel when we first arrived. He explained many things to use and really gave us the personal touch. Jackie in the buffet was funny and very helpful. The bar staff was very friendly and I never saw them push back on anybody that was being reasonable. General staff, waiters, greeters, maids, grounds keepers all where very friendly and went out of their way to help or attempt to answer your questions.All in all the couple we traveled with, the 6 others we meet and my wife all agreed the Majestic was awesome.

<Content>Not for young families!!! We went to the majestic during presidents week. We are a family that have a 2 and 5 year old. We were told how great this resort is for families. It is not!! Older kids are fine, but not small ones. There will be nothing for them to do in the evening, and very limited food choices. A few positives. The resort is quite nice. Pool and beach are beautiful. Staff is friendly, but very hard to communicate with. I had heard tipping was greatly appreciated and worth your while. Trust me - we tipped everyone,and got no better service.Food was good, but we had limited exposure due to having 2 small kids. You will be stuck with the buffet. Now to the bad stuff. Our toilet and bed were broken upon arrival. Fixed the next day. Needless to say my husband and I did not sleep at all the first night - not great! Nothing for the kids to do at night. Entertainment starts at 10pm. They did show a movie at 7pm - in spanish (we are from NY). Once we put the kids to bed on the first night,we sat on our terrace (across from the spa). At 8-9pm they started removing the roof (palm/thached). Chopping it off then carting it away in a truck. Very relaxing!!! I called the front desk at 10pm and they said they would be done soon. Theycontinues the next night as well.Long stoy short much more happened. We all got sick day 3 and decided to go home. We aere all quite sick. Doctor at the place was a joke. We lost a ton of money coming home early, but we were glad when we were home (came home in a snowstorm!). We have NEVER left a vacation early. Feel free to contact me!

<Content>Amazing Resort My wife and I just returned from Majestic Colonial Punta Cana. We were travelling with three other couples and everyone had a great time. I will keep my review simple and to the point.......FOOD- The food was amazing. If you can't find something you like at this resort then you must have a hard time finding something you like at home. Lots of variety at the many a la carte, and buffet. Highly recommend the Gourmet ( reservations required). Both the chicken and the Beef were to die for. and the Japanese ( best meal of my vacation, also reservations were required) and at the seafod restaurant, the lobster was excellent.POOL- The pool was amazing, there was an abundance of lounge shares and lots of shade if you wanted it. The water volleyball was fun. There was always enough to make a game.BEACH- The beach was great. Always chairs available ( TONS OF THEM) and like the pool there was lots of shade if you wanted it. Beach Volleyball was lots of fun.STAFF- The staff here are more than accomodating, they always greet you with a smile and an  Ola. Bartenders, animaion team, maids, wait staff, security, even the maintenance people.... all great. I found that as long as you tried to speak a little spanish, greet them with a smile , and leave a little tip everyone is happy.BARS- There are many types of bars in the resort, for many different tastes and desires. If you like the lounge scene the bar in the main lobby and the downstairs bar aree excellent. My favourite was the swim up bar. Victor is a great bartender Yeah Baby. There are also the 2 other poolside bars and the beach bar. all are great.ACCOMODATIONS- The rooms are very roomy, King size Beds, couch, Sattelite TV, Mini Bar ( leave a little note in your fridge with a little tip and they'll give you what you want). Our room smelled a little musty at times and our toilet didn't flush the first morning but maintenance was there within 2 minutes and fixed it.In general everyone had an excellent vacation and many people I spoke with at the resort were there for their second or third time. I know I would definetly return

<Content>Francisco - a great animator We just loved our stay at the Majestic resort in Punta Cana, truly a five star hotel. The room was clean, the service excellent, the site absolutely magic, the pool huge, beautiful. The food is also excellent.A few suggestions - it was difficult to get reservations more than once at the Japanese restaurant which is excellent. There could be a wider selection of 脿 la carte restaurants e.g. an italian 脿 la carte and there could be more variety at the buffet, different selection everyday. Also, there were no facecloths provided faciales. We had to beg everyday to get them. They should always be provided everyday in all rooms. One last detail, there was no wastebasket in one of our two rooms, we asked for one and never got it. We would have liked to be able to buy dominican music at the resort or beach, we managed to find some at the airport coming back.We want to say a special thanks to Francisco, our spanish teacher. He is very nice and friendly. Thank you Francisco for the great suggestions of dominican music. I am currently listening to Anthony Santos ... and thinking about you and the great time we had at the Majestic. We are looking forward already to going back. Lina was also a great aerobic teacher.Muchas gracias !! 脿 bient么t !!Jean, Joanne, Andr茅ane et Val茅rie

<Content>Enjoyed our stay Linda  Vince of Delanco,NJ really enjoyed our stay at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. The rooms were beautiful and well maintained,just had to get used to the power going off when you opened the door or when we didn't move around much,due to the sensors in the rooms. We really enjoyed the animation team,in particular,Samuel and Sandy,who were very nice to talk to,we didn't have the opportunity to speak to the rest because they were always entertaining the guests. We highly recommend the resort. Always plenty to eat and drink and plenty of room at the pool and beach.

<Content>Fun family vacation in the sun! We spent a week at the Majestic Colonial with extended family from February 16 to 23rd. We were a group of seven, including two children, aged 3 and 6. Among us, we have travelled in the past few years to Cuba, Mayan Riviera, Barbados, and Jamaica. When we booked the holiday, we were thrilled with the reviews on this site and were getting more concerned in the months before we left.Check-in went well - we were greeted with cool towels and a Majestic drink and two of the three rooms were ready - the third within an hour or so.I e-mailed Richard before we left and we accomodated us with three rooms next to each other and away from the construction. He was on lunch break when we arrived and when I went later to thank him, he was disappointed to not have brought us to the room. He was very helpful with a number of special requests and took care of us right away. Very friendly and professional - thanks Richard.RoomsWe all had champagne in the room on arrival (nice touch). The rooms were large and clean. We had a king size bed and a couch and cot for the kids and there was still plenty of room. None were musty - the tropics are humid. As discussed, the bathrooms were open concept, which was fine for us, but would not suit everyone (and would not be great if you were sick). The rooms were cleaned well (although the times did vary) and we left a tip for the maid with a little gift daily. We never had bugs and maybe one mosquito. The air conditioning worked really well (we had to turn it down daily) - just remember it turns off automatically if your patio door is ajar. The fridge was stocked daily.We did have a pipe come apart under the sink when we first arrived, spilling water over the floor. It took three calls to have it repaired. On the other hand, when our safe would not open and we called, someone was there to fix it in under 10 minutes. This is a big resort.I will try to describe the lay out - There are four rows of rooms running from the lobby to the beach. Each of these building is 3 - 4 stories high and the rooms are numbered with the lower numbers close to the lobby and buffet and the highest numbers (50, 51, etc being oceanfront). Building one looks towards the neighboring resort. The rooms closest to the lobby would likely have been having to listen to the loud theatre from that resort which faces those rooms. Building 2 runs along the pool (and the first floor is the swim-out rooms. We were in 2227 (second floor, half-way down) which was great. This is quite closed to the pool bar and cocktail hour activities, so was a bit noisy in the afternoon. This did not bother us as we were not in the room much during the day and the noise ended promptly at 6pm. Building 3 borders the walkway and is probably the quietest (although the rooms closest to the lobby would be bordering the Majestic theatre). Building 4 faces the construction of the New Majestic next door.There is a fair bit of walking, from beach to room to lobby area. The access from rooms to the lobby and buffet were covered, which was nice when it rained (don't worry if this happens - even when it looked awful, it was sunny and clear within an hour). There were elevators everywhere. It was one of the more accessible resorts that I have been to. GROUNDS AND LOBBYThe lobby and grounds were beautiful. There were always people working on the property. They do appear to use a lot of pesticides and we were a little concerned to not see any wildlife (only one gecko the whole week) and birds in cages. This is our preference though, and I know that if they didn't do this, people would complain about bugs - can't please everyone.POOLWe are more beach people, but this was an unbelievable pool. It was huge and never seemed crowded. There was plenty of spots to have a quiet swim or to hang out by the swim-up bar. The temperature was good for us and the depth was perfect for the kids. The pool was spotless (they must have been cleaning it while I slept). We did notice some of the tiles starting to detach and as others have mentioned, the concrete around the pool was breaking in a few areas - they will be having to do some maintenance.BEACHThe beach was beautiful. The water is clear and blue and warm. Fun waves to play on and the best sand-castle sand I have ever seen. Be careful outside of the roped swimming area - my husband snorkeled around the area and saw lots of spiny sea urchins - just watch your feet. He snorkeled quite a bit from the beach and saw lots of fish (and when he went quite a way out, even a ray!). Boogie boards were fun and if you walk to the left down the beach to the undeveloped area, there is some great body surfing (a bit rough for the kids). Take a walk and enjoy the undeveloped beach - it won't be there long! Although we never had a problem getting each chairs or palapas we did find the beach a bit crowded and as people followed the sun and the tide moved in, people were more in each others space. The constant helicopter tours were a bit annoying, but not the hotel's fault. They could use another bathroom close to the beach - It is a long walk to the restaurant bathroom (especially with two kids who can never coordinate their trips). I would agree with others that they need more soap dispensers and towel holders in the public bathrooms. They were always empty.FOODOverall, the food was fine. You would have to be pretty picky to not find anything to eat. Lunch was the least selection (although we only ever went to the beach restaurant - great view). We were happy to not see fries and hot dogs and burgers at every meal, but others might complain.... Chicken was great, check doneness if they are busy though. Breakfast was awesome. Some dinners at the buffet were better than others - beef was generally overcooked, but there was always good pasta and meats or seafood cooked to order (lamb, salmon, squid and shrimp). We also ate dinner at the Steak (great steak - which was not expected in the Carribean, and pork chops) and we all had good meals at the seafood. Dominican/Mexican was pretty good, but salty. My brother went to the Gourmet, which he said was great and three people went to the Japanese, which they said was just okay. (two of that party got very sick the following day, but cannot say for sure it was the food). It was nice to not hav eto make reservations (especially with the kids), but they were eager to get you moved out at the Steak.... One note - we were traveling with a child with a severe peanut allergy and were very pleased with the response and care at the resort and restaurant. I had e-mailed in advance and Richard prepared small cards for me to show the restaurant staff, explaining the situation simply. He explained the situation to a guest services person who e-mailed the restaurants to advise that there would be a person with a food allergy. The cards were well received (don't ask the wait staff, find the manager or chef in the restaurant). We were very impressed that they consulted the kitchen and carefully brought us around the buffet or walked us through the menu for safe foods. Two managers even introduced themselves to my daughter (age 6) and assured her that they did not want her to get sick - THIS WAS EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE IN OUR EXPERIENCE, EVEN HERE IN CANADA. There were lots of options (we stayed away from desserts as a precaution and brought our own treats).There is lots of water available - they will give you bottles at any bar on request and several in the room. Heed the warnings and don't drink the water and don't brush your teeth with it (can't say this is the cause, but our two sick group members did brush their teeth with tap water). We ate salad and fresh fruit all week and drank drinks with ice and were fine. Do bring some pepto along, in case you get some travelers stomach - I was a bit queasy a couple of days, but nothing unmanageable.ENTERTAINMENTDidn't go to any shows or casino, so can't comment. There was live music on the outdoor patio near the buffet every night which was nice and fun for an after dinner night cap. We went out one night and the lobby bar was busy and social, although I don't think that this would be much of a party resort and wouldn't suit young singles or couples looking for a bar or dancing scene. There are lots of children (including ours), so if this is not something you are comfortable with this might not be the right place for you - there is no adults only section of the resort. That said, despite the number of kids, the Kids Club looked awful and I would not have left my kids there. The castle and water slide looked to be in disrepair (and maybe a bit unsafe). We peeked in when no one was there and the indoor set-up looked better - clean play areas for crafts, games and some videogames (if that is your interest). We saw a few kids at lunch with staff and they seemed to be having fun, but I would not have been comfortable with it. It is at the very front of the resort, away from everything, in the sun and too far from where I would be - but that's me. Lots of stuff to do with the kids anyway on the beach so we had fun. Bring your own beach toys if you can - they will charge you a lot there and its worth it to have the sand toys and a floating chair.SERVICEWe found the staff throughout the resort friendly and helpful and especially great to the children. These people work very hard and are away from their families for close to two weeks at a time at the hotel camp area. Acknowledging their work with a thank you or a hello goes a long way. I notice complaints about language barriers on this site - you are going to a Spanish-speaking country, so people there speak Spanish. (Just a note to one lady I witnessed at a bar - speaking loudly and painfully slowly in English does not equate Spanish or make you more understood!) Invest in a travelers dictionary and/or learn a few key phrases and it will be appreciated and very useful.Sorry to be a bit long-winded, but hope its helpful. Overall a great trip! The resort will have to do some maintenance to keep their rating.

<Content>The Animation Team Rocks! I traveled alone (with a group of 60 people that I did not know, except for my one friend who was the travel agent) and had no expectations - just needed to relax in the sun and leave the stresses of the NYC bond market behind! I had been to Punta Cana two years ago (Grand Palladium Bavaro) and fell in love with Punta Cana, the beaches, the Caffe con Leche, the Larimar, and, of course, the people (both guests and staff). The main difference between my two trips was that the Majestic had an Animation Team, which the Grand Palladium did not have when I went two years ago. I cannot even begin to envision what this vacation would have been like if I had not had the opportunity to meet, talk, laugh and dance with Ray, Jimmie, Milton, Jesus, Samuel and Lina, the people from the team that I bonded with the most. Let me say here that the entire Majestic staff was excellent (except for one really rude roulette dealer)--from the main lobby to the restaurants to the housekeeping staff. (A special acknowledgement to Marisol from the breakfast buffet. My Marisol was so attentive to our group of six that she would have a table prepared as she saw us walking down the aisle!) When in the people business, the highest level of congeniality and good service is to be expected in all areas by any traveler. However, the enthusiasm and attention paid by the Animation Team was above and beyond - definitely an extra added bonus - one that, if it had not existed, would have diminished my experience exponentially. I miss each and every one of them - and truth be told, when I come back to Punta Cana, it would be to the Majestic because of the Animation Team. As a P.S., my girlfriend was in Riu Palace the week after me and she raved about it - I am tempted to go back there with her - but I will travel with her and stay at the Majestic just to see my new friends. What I would do for a merengue with Samuel or Jesus or to watch Taki Taki right now at the pool on this rainy NY day! It is catastrophic that I am not there (shout out to Jesus). Hola to the entire Animation Team at the Majestic Colonial, Punta Cana. I hope to see you all again real soon. Thanks for a great week.

<Content>Heaven on earth I stayed at the Majestic for 8 days from Feb. 24/2008 - Mar. 3/2008. I traveled there with two of my girlfriends and we had the time of our lives! The friendly faces at the front desk make for a great start to your vacation! All the staff was super friendly and always willing to help. Majority of the staff also spoke decent english which was nice! The Animation team was AMAZING! Always got the crowd pumped up and ready for fun! LEO, RAY, FRACISCO, HENRY, MALVIN, and others whose names I have forgotten made our trip one of the best! The Taki Taki (theme dance) was fun to watch, but not so easy to learn haha. The Animation team worked very hard to ensure that everyone was always have the best time. They are all also very good looking! ;) *wink*The food was delicious! The only downside was that the buffet's were always the same. The food was great, but after a few days you get tired of eating the same stuff. The restaurants for dinner are fabulous. And you don't need reservations for most of them!The rooms were very clean and spacious! We had an extra bed brought into our room, and we stil did not feel cramped. The beach was gorgeous! Lots of seating and lots of shade. If you are worried about getting the seats you want you can simply reserve them by putting your towels on them in the morning. everyone abides by these rules. The pool was the perfect temperature, and never too crowded! It's long enough that no particular area ever gets congested. The shows at night we found to be very entertaining! Hillarious! All in all we had a great stay, and are so sad to be home! Will we return one day? I SURE HOPE SO! -Alanna

<Content>Majestic Was Great! New HampshireWe stayed at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana from Feb 23to March 1, 2008. To give you an idea, we have stayed at the Iberostar Tucan, Iberostar Paraiso Beach (Mayan Riviera), Sandals in St. Lucia, Secrets in Punta Cana, Allegro in Cozumel, Iberostar in Cozumel amongst others. I hope this helps:The Room location鈥? Each building runs from the front lobby to the beach. As you look out from the lobby to the beach, Building 1 is on your far left, building 2 is also on your left, the pool is in the center, building 3 is on your right, and building 4 is on your far right. Again, ..this is as you look from the Lobby area to the beach. This is important because building 4 is next to the new construction and farthest from the pool, therefore, I would say, the least desirable. Building 2 is the only building with poolside rooms and this is where we stayed. This was the most desirable as you were close to the pool and away from the new construction. The rooms nearest the lobby start with room number 1 as in 2101 (which means building 1, first floor, room one). The room closest to the beach would be room 2150 (building one, first floor, room 50). We stayed in room 2135. This was close to the swim up pool bar and the center for most of the daytime activities. If you want it a little quieter, rooms 2101 to 2125 would suit you. Buildings 3  1 were set up in a similar fashion and would be suitable as well.Also, the pool has a small wall, which divides it. On the side closer to the lobby rooms 2101 thru 2128, that part of the pool was noticeably warmer than the water nearer the pool bar. Food: The food was excellent. At each restaurant we were all very pleased (16 of us), but this obviously is up to personal tastes. The Chateaux Brian at the steak house, the tenderloin at the Gourmet Restaurant (French), and the Fried Lobster at the seafood restaurant were all very good. Some thought the Japanese restaurant was the best (be sure to sign up for this restaurant as soon as you arrive) so again, it is all up to personal tastes. The overall facility is wonderful. Although the resort was full, we all commented that we never felt crowded. There were poolside chairs available throughout the day and the same was true at the beach. A few people got up early to save seats, but this was not as predominant as I have seen at other resorts. The lobby areas were outstanding, including an outdoor patio/bar area with musical entertainment each night.All facilities have minor problems from time to time, a leak, a musty smell鈥tc.. The front desk was very accommodating to make changes, as this was necessary for one couple in our group. The Majestic is a wonderful vacation spot. We would definitely return.You can email me at pmoll2001@yahoo.com if you have any questions.Phil

<Content>Other places to visit My husband and I stayed at the Majestic in November the week after Thanksgiving. We were really looking forward to this vacation away after hearing so many good things about Punta Cana in general. As far as the hotel is concerned, we had a nice room overlooking the pool area which was very convenient. The room had a musty smell but we both got use to it after a few days. The room was always clean and had no issues with bugs in our room. The grounds were very nice. We spent most of our days lounging at the pool which is one of the best pools at a hotel we have ever stayed at. As far as the food goes, it NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. Honestly, neither of us became ill but it became extremely unappetizing after 2-3 days. The pizza was recycled left overs as well as many other dishes. We felt very confined in the hotel also. We travelled out for a cab ride to another resort and felt very unsafe. They don't have guards at the hotel entrances for no reason. All in all, it was a relaxing vacation, the pool was great, the grounds were nice, but the food was horrible, and stay in your resort. There are many other beautiful places to visit so I don't believe we will be going back.

<Content>Absolutely Majestic I want to start my review with the advice to not believe all the horrible things that you have previously read. The simple fact is this: You cannot please all people, and those who have complained of dirty rooms and facilities, rude staff, or the fact that people don't speak English are clearly spoiled, impossible to please travelers. Now with that out of the way I will begin my review: Check in: Check in was extremely easy and we were greated with cool, mint-scented washclothes. We were not, unfortunately, greeted with the Majestic Drink(but i had plenty of those later on to suffice). The bell boy was really nice, as was the concierge and all of the staff that we met along the way. The room was very nice and big, clean, with the nicest shower that was all tiles. The toilet area is a little bit odd and could have had more space, but that was no big deal. We had THE BEST view from our room. We were facing the pool, oh the beautiful pool, and looking right onto the pool bar and all the activites that went on right around the bar. I loved just sitting on my balcony and people watching. I also need to mention that the chambermaids do an excellent job cleaning. They don't just make your bed with your old sheets, they replace your sheets with fresh ones every single day. They also leave some fresh flowers and do cool little designs with your comforters. They were all very sweet and as helpful as they could be.The Pool: No words can effectively describe this pool. They just can't so I won't even try, you can only believe how gorgeous it is if you see in person. Many places to sit and no problem getting a palapa or chair.The Beach: Gorgeous, again no problem getting chairs there either. I am missing my morning dose of Toni Braxton and Lionel Richie during the 10 am hour for stretching! The Food: Really, no complaints. Buffet is fine, plenty of choices for a picky eater. I urge you, eat the mango, I think my roommate and I ate at least 7 on our own. Great manchego cheese as well, if they have any left. Breakfast is the best, I ate enough Bacon for a small army. Crepe's were great, and the staff is so attentive, you feel as if they outnumber the guests 2:1. The restaurants were very good. The Steakhouse is awesome, the Gourmet was good, but we liked Taino, the Domincan/Mexican the best.Entertainement: We didn't really go out at night, but we did catch one show and it was actually really good. The dancers could move, man! During the day there was always something going on, bikini contest, arm wrestling contest, dancing, spanish lessons, scuba! The bars were really nice and there were plenty to choose from. We liked Victor at the pool bar Yeah Babay(exactly how he says it) and we want to extend our special love to our boy Pablo, yummy. One note: Don't try to order any unique drinks because unless Pablo is waiting on you, they won't know how to make it and you can end up with a really different type of drink; I speak from experience.Excursions: I encourage everyone to go on an excursion, and we did go to La Isla Saona, and that was probably the highlight of the trip, it was just so different, and we went to a private island and also were able to see the Dominican country side with the sugar cane fields and the villages.Overall I need to reinforce that some people are just impossible to please, and that's a shame because this resort is nothing less than spectacular. You will love it, we were so sad to leave. But as Francisco once said you have to leave to come back. See you in a minute, Pablo!

<Content>Best Holiday Ever !!!! HOLA FROM PUNTA CANADA.....We were there February 7 - February 21 and have to say that it was the best ever. If we had one complaint, it would be that it was alittle windy from our ocean front room.We were on the third floor room number 3346. My sister,brother in law and friends that we went with were just as happy as we were. I do not know what some people expect as we were treated like royalty. When we walked into our room, we thought we were dreaming. We have stayed at some very nice resorts and before this one, I had loved the RIU. Now I love the Majestic. We were surprised at all the little extras they gave us. Champagne and a bouquet of flowers one night. 2 golf shirts and golf hats another night. A beautiful complimentary breakfast Valentines day. The staff are so friendly and helpful that they make the holdiay a pleasure. We want to give thanks to Ray and Jimmy from the animation staff. Thanks to Denny the beach waiter, to Lucy the photographer, great pictures Lucy and I am the lady that wanted to keep my glasses on and you wanted me to take them off. Thanks to Cristobal and Melvin the bell boys. Thanks to Julie and Freddy from the Majestic Spa. Thanks to Pablo the bartender and a very special thanks to Jenny, the hostess. I would still like to bring you home. To our maid who was so good to us and made our room so very nice. Thanks to her for getting me a regular coffee machine when she found out I didnt like expresso. The Majestic has a room ( off from the reception ) that allows you to shower and get ready before your flight. Great idea and very impressive. Thanks to the 2 maids that came into the room and insisted on doing my hair for me and then didnt want to take a $2.00 tip. For everyone that we tipped, you all deserved it. I know how much you appreciated it as well as the little gifts we brought for you.The entertainment was never the same for the 14 nights we were there and the Michael Jackson show was unbelievable. We went to Puerto Plato a few years ago and now to Punta Cana...no comparrison. Beautiful beaches and beautiful people. The food, drinks, lounges we all fantastic. Loved the shower and dont let the bathroom scare you, that was all good as well. We were impressed with the amount of closet and drawer space and loved the bathrobes and slippers. It was a hotel away from home.We will be back as but just want to say - THANKS TO EVERYONE THERE....

<Content>Magic at the Majestic I have just returned from an 8 day trip to Punta Cana with my two girlfriends. First of all, what a beautiful, friendly, amazing country! My very first trip to the Caribbean was truly superb.The Majestic was our first choice of resort because of it being a 5 star as well as the rave reviews we'd been reading. After our one week at the Majestic, we were told by our tour company that our flight was delayed 10 hours - therefore, they shipped our entire flight of people to a different resort for the night until our flight the next morning. This other resort was supposed to be a 4 star. I can honestly say, the difference between 4 and 5 star is tremendous. The staff (no smiles), non-English speaking, small, stinky rooms, don't waste your time - JUST GO to the Majestic!The staff, from the moment you check in (Victor was fabulous), to the moment you check out and all the days in between are courteous, helpful and very efficient. Not once did I walk by a Majestic staff member and not receive an hola and a smile. We tried to learn a bit of Spanish to be able to communicate the basics, but this resort is tri-lingual and as such, it was very easy to communicate. Our favourite part of the week was definitely the Animation Team. A wonderful, fun and very hard working group of people that ensure you are always having fun - and, in some cases, embarrassing yourself. A HUGE thank you to these guys in particular for a week of laughs, dances and wonderful memories: Francisco, Sandy, Leo, Rey, Melvin, Jesus, Lina, Samuel, Eddy, Henry, Jimmy...and everyone else (and Modesto at Sunwing!). We will be doing the Taki Taki in our sleep for weeks to come. So thank you to the entire staff at the Majestic for making my first (and not last trip) to Punta Cana truly the best vacation ever. I will come back. I promise.

<Content>Please Fix the Food! My husband  I stayed at the Majestic from Feb. 23 to Feb 29 and chose the resort based on Trip Advisor reviews. Our goal was a relaxing vacation at a nice beach, and that wish was fulfilled. There were many things we liked, but some things need attention to make this resort deserving of its ranking.Things that were great: 路 Check in was smooth. Richard greeted us, showed us to our room and helped with our restaurant reservations. Such a nice man! He was very helpful before our stay and really showed personal attention.路 We had booked a swim up room (2129) and we were not disappointed. It was worth the extra money and we loved the location, about halfway between the lobby  beach. The room smelled just a little musty, but I brought a room freshener, which took care of the problem. The bed was very comfortable and bedding looked fairly new. The room was very quiet and we slept well. Air conditioning was adequate, and easy to control. The room was clean with only two mosquitoes sighted and no bites during our stay. The robes and treats (champagne, fruit platter, sushi, and grapes  wine) delivered on four nights were a nice touch. 路 The beach and pool were beautiful and it was wonderful to be able to get chairs and palapas without playing the towel game. The beach is great for walking and is so beautiful with all the palm trees. The pool was always clean and has many quiet nooks to hang out. The swim up bar was a lot of fun at happy hour.路 Drinks were good. The signature Majestic drink is delicious. They make a great cosmo at the downstairs poolbar.路 The staff were very friendly for the most part and were always smiling and happy. It helps to smile and try to speak a little Spanish. The animation team was friendly, but not overbearing. They tried to get guests involved, but took no for an answer if you weren鈥檛 interested. 路 Evening entertainment on the plaza, the sax player and combo, were very good. 路 It was nice to be able to go to restaurants without making reservations. 路 The resort is a nice size. You can walk from the beach to lobby in about 5 minutes. Needs improvement: 路 Where鈥檚 chef Gordon Ramsey when you need him? He鈥檇 have a field day here. The food in itself will probably keep us from returning. The buffets are reminiscent of college cafeteria food. Soups and hot foods were cold, cold foods were warm. Beef was tough. Things weren鈥檛 displayed to even attempt to make them look appetizing. There weren鈥檛 enough tongs for all the dishes. (This sounds picky, but when you think of how many people touch the tongs, it really spreads illness.) We did have a few good restaurant meals, but service was often rushed. You didn鈥檛 finish one course before the next arrived. Some of the restaurant meals were awful. (I can give you more details if you like.) Breakfast at the main buffet is probably the best meal of the day. Lunch is not good anywhere. At lunch there are too many logjams at the buffets. People pile up waiting for pasta, grilled items, and panini sandwiches. They need to come up with a way to serve simple, tasty, appetizing food quickly for lunch. And what is that tacky hut doing in the middle of the palapa restaurant? 路 Maintenance is an issue. I can see this place going down hill fast from lack of maintenance. Things stayed broken all week. The ice machine near our room didn鈥檛 work. One of the shower heads at the beach shower broke off  was never fixed. A halogen light kept blinking off  on at the plaza stage where the sax player  band play. Walkways around the pool have potholes. There鈥檚 a path at the bottom of one of the bridges at the pool that is pieces of stones just sitting in some shale. People kept tripping on the stones all week. This really needs fixed before someone gets hurt. On the other hand, we saw a maintenance worker polishing the floor in the lobby at 9 PM while people were trying to walk through or sit and relax. This seemed like bad timing to me.路 Sickly landscaping. Trees and shrubs don鈥檛 look healthy. Grass is lumpy. No birds or animals. 路 Not enough public restrooms by the pool  beach. Please put up some paper towel holders and more soap dispensers! There is just one soap dispenser per restroom and very inconveniently placed! Paper towels got wet setting on the sink counter. I saw so many people go to the bathroom, rinse their hands without using soap then proceed to the palapa restaurant where they touch those tongs that are in such short supply. No wonder people get sick!路 On our third day, I was sick and confined to my room with diarrhea, vomiting and severe headache. I was unable to eat or drink much the following day, but was ok for a few days, then the sickness returned just in time to get on the plane. My husband never got sick, but we ate different things.路 Tiny plastic drink cups. Make sure you bring your own cup. Iberostar used larger plastic cups that they rewashed. It bothered me to think about how much plastic was going into the garbage between the bottled water and the drink cups. 路 The animation team could use some new tapes. You could set your watch by 鈥淗otel California鈥?and 鈥淩aining Men鈥?by the end of the week. Same music everyday for stretching, aerobics, etc.If you鈥檝e booked the Majestic, don鈥檛 despair! There is a lot to like. We had a nice time, but there is definitely room for improvement. This place has the potential to be a first class place, but I can see signs that management may be letting things going downhill. Maybe there鈥檚 a cash crunch due to the building of the new resort next door? I would give the food a 2 and the rest of the resort a 4. I would probably not come back unless the price were right. We paid a premium price for this place, but have had better food at resorts that were less expensive.

<Content>Truly Majestic We just returned from 7 wonderful days at the Majestic Colonial and I am amazed that anyone could give this all-inclusive resort a bad review. The only glitch in our stay was our friends did not get the room we asked for but Victor (one of the managers) ceratinly made it up to them and corrected the problem the very next day. This sometimes happens when you go to a resort on their busiest weeks. At check-in ask for Francisco. The resort itself is absoluetly gorgeous. The facility layout is convenient yet provides enough space that it never seems crowded even though it was totally booked, the never ending pool is spectacular and the rooms (we took the swim out Majestic Junior Suite) beautiful and comfortable. Service and staff at this resort is second to none - friendly, courteous, and very acommodating. While we always tip extra for service (on everything) if you didn't I am convinced the service is the same. We just like to share our good fortune and are appreciative of their hard work. The beach is magnificent and lots of palapas available. We spent most of our day there topping the day off by the pool and in our hot tub on the patio (while drinking the Champagne they provided). They also gave us a fruit basket one evening and a bottle of Rum and Scotch another. Nice touch.The food was plentiful (best deserts we have had at any resort in the Caribbean or Mexico). The specilaty restaurants had a limited menu (we liked the Le Gourmet / splurge on the better wines for sale here and Tres Calaberas-Seafood / see Omar for he is the best) but the Supreme Buffet was limitless. Quality was very good and I would rate the food overall as a 4.5. Dreams in Puerto Vallarta had the best food for any all-inclusive we have ever stayed at (been to many). Entertainment was fun (Michael Jackson show, Circus, and and rest of the nightly theme performances) although the sound system could use an adjustment. Casino was adequate (can lose money there as well as any where). Fitness center also was adequate and I enjoyed my daily workouts there. Overall I give the Majestic a 4.8 out of 5. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. I would certaily go back. If you are a happy person whose cup is half full then go to the Majestic Colonial to fill up your glass. They will help make your stay a memorable one. If you are a grouch, stay on your couch, for no one can make you happy. ENJOY...........

<Content>Excellent Wow, After reading many of the reviews i was skeptical especially when traveling with spouse and two children for a 7 day AI. I travel often and stayed in DR-Puerto Plata, Barbados, Aruba... How did we get to know the site? Well Bahia Principe was overbooked and our travel agent offered it to us.... again we were nervous about accepting ... but just the lobby, our rooms and the beach convinced us that we were not budging! Five star!The site:Extremely clean for island standards. The property is is away from the city center although a local market exists on the other side of the street away from the Majestic property. If you forget sunscreen, swimsuit or toothbrush.. a series of stores are found on the property, and the prices are reasonable for island catering. Some development is commencing on the property next door but they are very respectful of us as tourists.... Because the property is on a point, the 0530 sunrises are ammmmazing... as are the sunsets; no obstacles!The food quality and presentation:Five star. We are discriminating eaters... every day had a surprise from the fish, lamb, pork, beef, chicken. Plenty of fresh ripe island exotic fruits: starfruit, papaya, watermelon, cantalope, guava, banana, etc. Once can indulge in fresh foods, or have them in a wide assortment of smoothie beverages. The chefs are exquisite.. and will make you a special blend (i enjoyed the seafood, vegetarian.. pailla). I was known to eat the decorative papayas because they were ripe (unlike in Canada) and delicious!The bar:Ok, champagne with fresh juice for breakfast, four servecas for lunch... pina coladas, rum punch, bahama mamas... did not get me tipsy but certainly were appreciated at many of the bars. Felix really is ammmmazing. Jose also brings your drinks to your sunchair on the beach.... The pool... very nice. Most important... very clean! The hospitality:The DR folks are warm, gentle and kind. The put our minds at ease. Very relaxing atmosphere among the hosts, bartenders, waiters all are keen to please. Even the maids are courteous, and polite. Just use you common sense! Things to do:Family exercise on the beach at 10 am was greatly appreciated, as was the dansing workouts.... bikini contest, and the evening performance at 10pm in the great hall. All in good fun.Morning have Jacques Brell and Edith Piaf melodies in an outdoor cafe... The beach:Outstanding. Check on google earth to view the beech, reef (with those neato fish), the wave break formations, and general distances. The beach sand is not too warm on the feet and bring sand castle equipment... Are of improvement:They have an amazing Spa... but it is not promoted so we skipped it on this trip.Also there are two massage tables on the beach in a hut... it is not widely promoted so it is easy to walk by forgetting that it exists.Words of caution:When using the aquatics equipment like snorkelling, catamaran, and etc. Actively listen to those folks since they fully understand the water and wind conditions. It was funny to see an French guy out on a catamaran ignore the guide.. and swamp it...i think the rear rudders were damaged... and likely cost him some bucks for damages. Had he gone out at 10am or at 2pm the prevailing winds are less intense... and again... careful with the amount of free drinks before heading out on the water.I could go on but all I can say is: five star. Will definitely consider another vacation to Majestic resort.Cheers,

<Content>Great February vacation where: Majestic Colonial Punta Canawhen: Feb. 19 to Feb. 25, 2008submitted by: sirigarden@aol.com What a wonderful place to stay. What a wonderful vacation. The property is really beautiful and very well cared for. Although there was a bit of a glitch with our suite when we arrived, the reception supervisor, Roberto Vizcaino was exceptional in working out the problem and made sure that everything was satisfactory. It was more than satisfactory...it was perfect. His efforts and considerations made our vacation suberb. One of the nicest aspects of this resort, beside the beauty of the property, both inside and outside, is the staff. Everyone has a smile and all are extremely helpful. A few of the people that deserve special recognition beside Roberto, are: Denny, the beach consierge,who was there anytime you needed anything and always with a smile, Omar at La Hispaniola Restaurant and Miguel at Restaurant Taino, both who made our meals even more enjoyable. We look forward to returning next Feb and enjoying our suite in their new addition which should be completed by November.

<Content>Fantastic vacation We stayed at the Majestic for 2 weeks, Feb 9, 2008 to Feb 23, 2008. What a good vacation and relaxing resort.Room : Our room was not ready at our arrival. So Richard, customer service rep., take care of us and explain that our room will be ready around 3.00PM. Richard explained that we will get what we asked in an ealier mail to him. Perfect room with good view and quiet. We get room 3223. Perfect. No problem with the maid. Food : We eat at the buffet almost every night in the first week. The choice was good and the taste okay. The pasta bar is very good, the reheat the pasta wih boiling water. Also they used pasta bowls for serving. Food at the bach was okay not to much burger or hot dog. This must not help The Majestic to have good review from US Citizens. Imagine hat you can't heat a hot dog or burger every day ! For us it was great. Special thanks to Nelson De Leon alias Nelson Mandella, who take care of us at lunch.Restaurant 脿 la carte : Gourmet very good meat. Wine not expensive. Good. Steakhouse, try the Chateaubriand.Beach : I would to salute my friend Denny and Fermir, the beach's consierge. Denny always bring me my 2 beers and vino blanco with a smile. He is trying to talk in french and was very nice witht us. He took time when it was not busy to discuss with us and teach me spanish. Thank you Sir Denny for your good service.I will go next year to this hotel next year.Daniel and Lulu

<Content>Not Recommended for Frequent Travelers Went with 2 other couples, 6 of us total, no kids. Purpose: for a relaxing trip full of sun/surf and beach/ pool. Host of problems: 1. Four out of six of us got sick- we did not drink the water, or eat lettuce or other veggies (recently washed in water)2. Pool was huge; however there were some kids swimming in dirty diapers3. Drinks were only OK at best (and we did tip the bartenders)4. Other than getting sick; the food did not taste good. Lots of buffets5. People with me wanted to leave early-- (I have never been on vacation and wanted to leave early)6. One room had a leaky ceiling and despite multiple complaints to front desk, it was never fixed  my friends were not granted a new room nor any discount (and the staff was occasionally very rude)7. Younger, ill-mannered couples were.. let's say making out in parts of the pool- and it wasn't stuff that anyone wanted to seeHowever: if you are going for a spring-breaky-all-you-can-drink trip and cant afford another hotel; this may be the place for you

<Content>Awesome Staff- Animation Team My boyfriend and I had the most AMAZING time at Majestic Colonial Resort. One thing that we found to be great was the staff there at the resort especially the animation team they are a wonderful group of people who love what they do and spend so much time and energy throughout the day getting resort members to participate in activities, and games. One particular person that is apart of the animation team that we got to know was Francisco. He is a great guy and loves what he does. Keep it up animation team and staff because it is you guys who make the stay at Majestic Colonial even more enjoyable and exciting.

<Content>Terrific Time at the Majestic Our family stayed at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana Resort President鈥檚 week 2008 (Feb. 16th to the 23rd). When I was looking for place a year ago, this site鈥檚 travelers gave it very high ratings. We travel a great deal and I use this site extensively when selecting places to stay on business and vacation. Just before we left I made the mistake of checking again. It was a big mistake! Some of the reviews were very negative. My reservation was booked and I couldn鈥檛 make a switch at that point. I鈥檓 glad I couldn鈥檛. The resort was wonderful. We鈥檝e been to about a dozen all inclusive resorts throughout the Caribbean and would rate this one in the top ten percent. There are pros and cons to every resort and I鈥檒l try to break them down for you here. There aren鈥檛 too many negatives though.The resort is about a half hour from the airport. We don鈥檛 like getting pre-paid transfers and travelling on a bus or in a van with a large group. We like the convenience of taking a taxi and the individual attention that goes along with it. As with most Caribbean airports, you need to get past the porters that attempt to steer you to a taxi for a gratuity. We passed these guys and found a large group of taxis about fifty yards from where we exited the baggage claim. The taxi fare to the resort was $35 before the tip. When we arrived we were greeted by the friendly bellmen that took care of our bags and got us on line for the check in process. They also gave us a cold moist towel to clean up with. A young lady handed us a frozen pink cocktail called appropriately called a Majestic. The check in took longer than I鈥檇 like, but not inordinately longer than what we鈥檝e previously experienced in the Caribbean. Our rooms were ready and we got the same category and location that we requested. (I called a week before we left to confirm.) We had two adjoining oceanfront suites on the third floor of building two. (Rooms 2351 and 2352) The suites were very large and had huge terraces with outdoor Jacuzzis. If you don鈥檛 get the top floor, you will be paying the same price but getting a smaller balcony with a less appealing view of the ocean. There was another Jacuzzi inside the room as well. The shower was large and tiled in marble. There was always plenty of hot water. The commode is in a tiny 鈥渃loset鈥?next to the double sinks. There鈥檚 also a telephone in the closet which I wouldn鈥檛 want to handle. If you鈥檙e a large person, I could see how this could be a little uncomfortable. Housekeeping did a nice job of keeping the place clean. I usually tip them when I arrive. I don鈥檛 think it made a difference. Our package included room service. Each night we would order some appetizers prior to going out for dinner. We usually got the sushi platter and a salad. It comes on regular china with linen. The only problem is getting them to take away the dishes when you鈥檙e done. There鈥檚 a small cabinet that opens to the hallway that you鈥檙e supposed to put the dishes in, but nobody comes to pick the stuff up unless you make a call. We ended up leaving it on the table, and I guess housekeeping took care of it. The room refrigerator gets restocked every day with water, beer and soda. We had espresso machines in our rooms that we put to good use. The beach is very nice. The water is clear, unlike the north shore of the Dominican Republic at Puerta Plata. There鈥檚 a reef about a hundred yards offshore where there鈥檚 a steady break. If you walk about ten minutes to the left of the resort, there鈥檚 some nice surf that鈥檚 adequate for boogie boarding and body surfing. We went scuba diving one day at a site called 鈥淧atata鈥? It was okay, not great. Not much coral or large fish. The day we went there was a strong surge. We always have a great time anyway. We had a very friendly and accommodating dive master named Angel. He works for the Mariana water sports company. They seem to have a monopoly on the water sports in that area. They have three Hobie Cats, boogie boards and one and two man kayaks. We never had a problem finding a lounge chair on the beach. If you arrive late though you might find it difficult to find a Palapas for shade.The pool is really large and clean. There are plenty of lounge chairs here as well. As was written in other reviews, we did find the water a little cool, but not too much so. The Animation Team was very friendly and fun. They weren鈥檛 too pushy as in other places. They have regularly scheduled events throughout the day.The restaurants were fine. There are six of them. We found that the best of the lot was the steak house on the beach. It鈥檚 attached to the seafood restaurant which is on the other side of the same dining room. We really like Mexican food and were a little disappointed with the food at their restaurant. The people that work at all the restaurants work very hard to please you. If you want to eat at the Japanese restaurant, you need to make a reservation as soon as you arrive. We waited until the second day to find that they were completely booked for the whole week of our stay. As I previously mentioned though, we got room service most nights and got the sushi platter delivered to the room. The main buffet restaurant had the most seating and the greatest variety of food. The only drawback is that if your room is near the beach, it鈥檚 about a five minute walk to the lobby area where this restaurant is, and that鈥檚 where you have to go for breakfast.The liquor was fine. Presidente is the beer on the island and tastes great. If you鈥檙e on the superior plan, as we were, you can get Johnny Walker scotch and Absolute vodka. The local rum was fine and is called Brugal.They give you a casino credit of $25 per room.We took a walk out to the shopping area near the front gate just outside the property boundary. It wasn鈥檛 worth the walk. We didn鈥檛 take the ATV excursion, but had planned on it when we arrived. There are tour operators set up in the lobby. Beware of these people. We were quoted a price in the morning for the ATV excursion. When we came back in the afternoon to take the trip, the price increased by fifty percent. When I reminded them that I was there earlier, they just stated that I must have misunderstood them the first time. The sales people became angry with us for suggesting that they were mistaken. Obviously they work on commission, but could have used some lessons in public relations. They then carried on loudly in Spanish making us feel very uncomfortable. I understand a little Spanish and what they were saying was not flattering. There are plenty of tour operators up and down the beach and I had no trouble finding friendly people elsewhere to book the same tour for the lesser price.The gym is adequately equipped with treadmills, elliptical machines, Stairmasters, free weights and a universal machine.All in all we had a great time and would recommend this resort to others that are planning on visiting the Dominican Republic.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever!!!! Im a little late in writing this review - but I still wanted to write one!Airport - so beautiful and small - you really feel like your on a tropical island - the drive is about 45 minutes from the resort - it's bumpy but its a nice way to see the island.Checkin / Rooms - We walked in and was treated to a Majestic drink which was YUMMY! We checked into our room - Had a Pool view and a partial ocean view - the room was gorgeous! The beds were hard yet comfy - TV had english channels, shower was AWESOME! The bathrooms were not very private but I would hang out on the balcony when my husband needed some private time :) Overall, rooms were great. I loved the safe too!Breakfast: There are two restaurants for breakfast - the first one is nearby the lobby which is HUGE - anything you can imagine is there ....my husband and I would sit for one hour drinking coffee, eating, and just relaxing. Breakfast closes by 10:30am so be sure to get there at a good time. The other restaurant opens at 10:30am-12 noon but is more a continental breakfast. We tipped a guy there and he was table serving us and had the chef make us eggs which was awesome! Lunch: We normally did continental - was at the same place as breakfast - so much variety. The pizza bar was delicious! Dinner: We loved the steakhouse which overlooks the ocean, we avoided the seafood, the mexican was good with the fajitas, we didn't like Le Gourmet (I got sick there) - the waiter was really cute though! :).Shows, Entertainment: We would normally go to dinner around 88pm - then have a drink, the shows would start around 9:30pm to 11pm - DON'T MISS THE MICHAEL JACKSON SHOW!!!!!!! IT IS SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! At 11pm, we would play at the casino or go to the disco - they have a small snack hut with burgers, hot dogs, etc... outside the disco which was nice. During the days, we would hang out by the pool, take long walks on the beach, read, and eat! I loved this resort .... my husband and I truly enjoyed ourselves here - It was truly amazing in everyway!

<Content>Did we stay at the same hotel?? We returned from the DR with a great tan, and full bellies! Our experience was great! with no problems and certainly none that some of the bad reviewers had. Right from the Airport our vacation was first class. The check in was seemless, other than the room we booked was not available which we were compensated for and as far as I'm concerned we still had a great room with a view of the ocean from the balcony. The staff were courteous, and friendly, always a smile and took the time for a chat or a joke. The gounds and the pool were lovely and the beach was to die for, very clean. It makes me wonder if we were all at the same hotel? I will say that my nomal lifestyle is not 5 Star at home, so maybe my take on the resort is different from those that live that life style in Canada or the US, however please remember you are not in your home country and they may not have the conveniences that you or I take for granted. The resort will need maintanence shortly because of the open style of the buildings (water damage )etc... but it is only 2-3 year old and I'm sure that will come.

<Content>Fantastic stay at the Majestic Colonial-Punta Cana We just returned from a week's stay at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. It was a fantastic vacation. The hotel was beautiful, always exceptionally clean, and the entire staff was friendly and helpful. The animation team made each day interesting and fun,especially Melvin and Leo, and the nightly shows were very good.

<Content>Average at BEST ! My family and I vacationed at the Majestic Jan 23rd thru the 30th. This was our 5 th all inclusive . All of which have been throughout the Caribbean and Mexico. I want to start off by saying that it has taken me a while to write this review mainly because I was trying to formulate a review that didn't revolve around a completely negative mind set. I ve read many bad reviews prior to the trip that concerned me and I need to say that not all of them were false. Many had much truth behind them. This is a legit review. I follow trip advisor very regular and believe in its importance to the worlds travelers and greatly appretiate all who take the time to write in. That being said.We flew USA 3000 out of Chicago and cannot say enough about our experience. I am a native of the Windy City and can never remember such ease of travel.We arrived in Punta Cana just as all have said; to the open air port. Do yourselves a favor and have $10 per person ready as well as your immigration card in hand when you hit the first counter. (ours was not provided by the airline-they ran out) so we scambled to fill it out at the last minute.We used the company Prieto tours to provide our transportation to the hotel and it worked out very well. There were about 8-10 guys waiting near baggage claim to assist you (more like jump on you like vultures-but their just trying to make a buck) to the company counter. Make sure their shirts read Prieto Tours. Once at the counter our names and reservations were verified and we were immed. shown to the van. Van wasn't bad. Air conditioning worked and it didn't break down so I felt we were starting out right.After about a 30-40minute ride we arrived at the Majestic. We were greeted with cool, mint scented towels to wipe our faces and refreshing fuit drinks called the Majestic. Check-in wasn't bad either. One room was ready the other we had to wait 30-45 minutes for a clean and prep. By the time we ate lunch and checked back in we were set. Bell staff did a nice job getting our bags to our room quick and without confusion. Just an FYI, if you are traveling with little ones they do provide cribs at request. Now some general info:We made the mandatory reservations for the 2 ala carte restaur. immed. at arrival to ensure they didn't all book up. All the other ala cartes were first come first serve. I have to say that the japanese and the steak were the best. all others just average! (In my opinion). The buffet was the most disappointing of all that we have encountered in our travels. Little to no taste to foods with rarely any variety. The temperature of the foods were usually cool to warm. Breakfast was best so don't miss it. ( I assure you I'm not a fussy eater - I'm from Wisconsin)Hotel grounds were beautiful. Staff always fixing and cleaning. Beach was nice- usually always picked up and neat.Never had much trouble getting a chair either on the beach or near the pool. Pool clean and refreshing.Did have many wonderful staff but on more than a couple occasions were supprised at the snobbish, arrogance of others. Did have long waits at the bars for drinks even at times when they were slower. Probably good we are not big drinkers.Shops were very expensive for common items- so do your shopping well before your trip. The casino was small- but the slots as described by one family memeber were loose. Maybe just their dumb luck.And of course the language barrier- But they guys--- your in a spanish speaking country..... We actually enjoyed using the spanish that we knew. Just need a bit more practice....Mucho Ron !!! Por Favor.We ended our trip much like we started, a nice trip back to the cold and snow of Wisconsin. I don't think we would go back. Many more places to visit.Hope this helped a little. Have a nice vacation.

<Content>Amazing Experience, Friendly and Attentive Staff I recently stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and it was wonderful. The staff is the most attentive and outgoing group of people I have ever encountered. Everyone is fluent in Spanish and English and seemed to be fluent in French as well. Very comfortable atmosphere. Bar staff is terrific and I can't say enough good things about the Dance team (evening entertainment) and the entertainment team, which organizes daytime activities for all the pool and beach bums. Watch out for Francisco and Rey - they were the best. Very funny, sweet and friendly, and even better - not bad to look at either! All around, I highly recommend this place for people who need to relax and don't mind mingling with pleasant staff and other outgoing visitors.

<Content>A fair stay at the Majestic.. We stayed at the Majestic from February 16 to the 25th 2008. I have a mixed opinion of the hotel. We had great weather and the resort was clean but it was not the best.Check In: I called the day before and spoke to someone in reservations and explained that we would arrive late. I requested connecting rooms or rooms next to each other with 2 double beds. I also explained that since we have young children we wanted a room in a quiet area. I was told we would be assigned rooms 2203 and 2204. We checked in at night. There were no adjacent rooms. I saw our rooms cards and the rooms we were assigned were crossed off. I asked why they were given away and they told me it was because of late check in. We were given two rooms near the theatre and overlooking the construction. They both had King Beds and we were told that they would have another bed in the rooms waiting. The rooms did not have beds waiting. One room had a spill on the floor of something sweet and was hot and full of flies. The other room was fine. It was 2 hours before they brought the beds and cleaned the room. The construction woke us up at 7:30am.Two days later, we were moved to Building 2 in the middle to far end of the resort overlooking the pool. It was much better.Rooms:Building #1 overlooks the Grand Paradise resort next door. If you are in the high number of building #1 you will see and smell the restaurant. Building #2 (the best in my opinion) overlooks the pool and has some ocean view rooms. It is generally quiet and easy access to the pool and beachBuilding #3 overlooks the other side of the pool and in the early numbers some of the resort and wedding gazebo; it is the second best building as long as you are not near the theater which is noisy at night. Building #4 is by far the worst unless you are really close to the beach. It over looks the construction and the early numbers are near the theater as well.The rooms are spacious compared to other resorts. They have open bathrooms which makes them look larger but can be embarrassing if you end up getting a sick stomach at night. There is little to no privacy if you are staying with friends and not close family or if you are staying with teenagers who like to use the bath alone.The beds are aged and in need of replacement. The pillows are foam. The bedspreads have been used a few too many times. In one room we had a new sofa but in the other the sofa was worn through and ragged. In other words, the furnishings can use a replacement. They also have few drawers to put your things but adequate closet space. They give terry robes which are nice and the bath towels are large. In one room the drain on the tub was broken and the magnifying mirror was torn from the wall. These things were never fixed during the stay.There is a nice terrace to sit outside with a rack for hanging clothes. The maids always keep the rooms clean. The mini bar has 4 bottles of water, soda and two beers daily. The grounds:The grounds are kept clean at all times. The staff takes pride and picks up all of the debris daily. The grounds are large and spacious and the resort never appears crowded. The main pool is HUGE. It is bigger than at most resorts. There is more than one quiet area for people who do not prefer the entertainment and activities by the pool. There is always a chair and never a fight for an umbrella or a seat which is nice. The only bad part about the pool was more a complaint from my children. It was BORING. It is just a pool. There is not a water slide, a wave pool, a lazy river, or a water recreation area for children as in most of the resorts we have visited. It is just a huge pool. Of course, that didn鈥檛 bother me but it did make it a little more difficult to keep the children entertained.The beach is gorgeous! The water was fairly calm and clean. The sail boats and kayaks are free as well as boogie boards although there is a wait to sail. There are plenty of umbrellas and showers as you exit the beach. The sand is soft and the beach is cleaned daily.The food:In my opinion, the food was very limited. It was probably the poorest selection of any buffet in an all-inclusive from my experience. We are not picky eaters. There was always something to eat. We ate. It just wasn鈥檛 great. For example, at the buffet, they would often run out of something, like grilled chicken midway through the lunch service and not have more. Also, there was just less selection.The A La Carte Restaurants were a little better 鈥?not great but better. We enjoyed the Churrasco at the Rodeo Steak House. We did not enjoy the lobster at the seafood as it was severely overcooked. We enjoyed fresh fish at the Mexican and the Oriental as well as fairly good egg rolls. The best part about the restaurants was that most did not require a reservation. You can just show up and they will normally seat you within a few minutes. The only required reservations are the Hibachi and the Gourmet. The Hibachi was disappointing. It was not done like the other resorts or like our local Hibachi restaurants. The cook just cooked 鈥?no tricks. However, on other nights I heard people cheering so it is possible that it was just our cook that was new and not all of the cooks. Overall, the food was fair to poor. The drinks were inconsistent. At one bar, the frozen drinks were cold and good; at the pool bar they were always warm. Also, the pool bar has no blender so they can鈥檛 make many of the drinks that they have at the other bars. They will fill any cup you give them so if you like to drink, bring your own container.Other impressions:The kids club was very nice. It has a small private pool with 2 slides and a nice indoor area with video games and bikes. Mainly it is for children ages 10 or below. It is far from the beach and main pool. They do a good job watching the children and my son enjoyed his time there.The entertainment was average; it was about the same as the other resorts with games by the pool and beach. There is water aerobics, stretching, aerobics at the beach, volley ball, tennis and a spa. We did not visit the spa. They also have massage at the beach which we did not try either. There were no special events. For example, at the Riu they had a night time celebration with fire and acrobats on the beach weekly. We have also been to resorts with a weekly outdoor picnic with food and entertainment. Most resorts also put out a special food and drink pool and beach side daily where they cook and serve you by the beach and pool around 2pm each day. They had none of that. They did have nightly bands and singing near the lobby with appetizers and a signature drink which was nice. Overall, I thought the resort was only OK. If you get a great price then go. It is worth it but if it is the same price as the Riu Palace or the Iberostar 鈥?go there instead. They have superior service and selection in my opinion.

<Content>perfect vacation We (my wife, 12 year old daughter, and I) just returned from a five night stay at the Majestic Colonial. The resort and its grounds are breathtaking! The staff are cordial and are anxious to please. These hard workers are most appreciativie of small tips here and there.Our room was spotless and beautiful, Champagne, terry robes and slippers were provided, a mosquito problem was remedied within 5 min. of our call to the front desk.The pool was immaculate and runs the length of the hotel, the beach was one of the most beautiful we have ever seen lined with plenty of huts for those wanting shelter from the sun. There are bars throughout the property and seven restaurants to choose from.Jenny, the hostess at the buffet is a delight(always a warm welcome and sunny smile). Keep in mind that vacationing in the Dominican Republic is not for gourmets,the food is fair with enough choices to satisfy. Appreciate this resorts beauty, play the pool and beach games,walk the magnificent beach and gaze at the blue ocean for a great escape.We hope to return next year along with friends.

<Content>Majestic Colonial - Beautiful and friendly Just got back from a 6 night stay. Our group consisted of 2 adults and (2) 5 year olds and (2) 10 year olds. I was very worried to go on this trip after reading some of the reviews. I must tell you that if you are thinking of booking this hotel you will not be disappointed. Front desk - Everyone at the front desk was friendly and helpful. Richard was the best. He showed us to our room and gave us a run down about the property. We had an issue with AA cancelling our sceduled flight and Francisco at the front desk was very helpful giving advice and writing a letter for us. They assisted in everything we needed.Lobby - absolutely beautiful. Beautiful sitting areas and nice bars.Staff - The friendliest people!!!!! Anytime I needed anything they were right there to help. The bartenders, waitresses and waiters were all very friendly and helpful. I do not speak spanish and had no problem communicating with anyone. The staff at this hotel works very hard and it shows.Pool - Magnificent. Although we spent most of our time at the beach the pool is beautiful, clean and never ending. Beach - one of the nicest. Beautiful blue water and white powder sand. Always plenty of chairs and huts. We never had to race down to reserve a chair or hut. Water is relatively calm. I actually got to lay in the chair while my kids were in the water. I cold not do this in cancun because the water was too rough. Image getting to lay on a chair with 2 young kids!!! Denny is great. He always checked on us to see if we needed drinks. I'll miss him.Restaurants - All very good. The best place for breakfast and lunch was at the buffet near the hotel. There is also a buffet near the beach but we liked the the one near the hotel best. We ate at all the restaurants except for the gourmet. The gourmet restaurant does not allow children under 12. We liked the chinese and the japanese the best.Shows - really, really good. The best one was Michael Jackson!! Don't miss it.Casino - small but good for a change of pace. My husband loved it. Everynight he played texas holdem until 3:00 a.m.Spa - I took my daughter for her first spa treatment. Spa is beautiful and very relaxing. She loved it too!!! I think she is hooked. Rooms - clean and spacious. The maids work very hard and there was alway cold drinks in our fridge. The negative comment I have about the room is that they need to change their pillows and bedding to a higher quality.I hope this review helped. We had a great time and think if you are planning a trip to the majestic you will not be disapointed.

<Content>Well worth the trip We stayed @ the Majestic from Feb. 13-20th with a group of 12 all couples. It was everthing I expected. I expected a beautiful beach, a very clean resort, a nice pool, good service,safe place,  plenty of food  drink!If you like to take long walks on the beach this is the place to do it! Just like All Inclusives you will find food you like  dislike.We were told to restrict too many of the pina colada drinks per day because these have a natural substance that can upset the stomach. People that have had a stomach problem this could do it! The food was good  you will never go hungry!If you have booked this resort don't worry it is wonderful.We had bottles of wine  sushi  fruit left in our room every evening (different every night)! Music on the patio area early evening. We played cards  enjoyed the nice weather!Don't forget to take your Bubba Kegs the bartenders don't mind filling them. We would get a few filled up with beer or mixed drink  share them with all @ the beach. Saves all that exercise stuff!

<Content>Good Experience at the Majestic We travelled to the Majestic during school break Feb 18- 25. We were a party of 4,adults and 2 12 year olds. As many have stated, we were concerned with the previous negative reviews. I will just touch on some of what concerned us before going.BEACH: Fabulous. Perfect blue water, clean white sand. As some have stated, there is some coral. It's easy to see and easy to avoid. One part of the beach does have a safety line so people avoid the coral. Next to it an area of soft white sand. No need for water shoes whatsoever in either place. If you go out beyond the safety line, coral is the least of your problems. Boats from various excursions zoom by. The roped off area has great waves for boogie boarding. I think that is due to the coral close to shore. In the area that is not roped off, it is much more calm (less coral close to shore). No need to worry about rip tides etc as the current pushes you into shore. There are waiters on the beach for drinks and it's a very short walk to the beach bar for a cocktail.Rooms: Large and clean. No problem with housekeeping as they took care to leave extra towels etc. We had a fabulous balcony room overlooking the pool and the beach. We had wonderful breezes all night and usually opted for sleeping with the slider open rather than the ac. No problems with bugs. The ac did work very well. As for a musty smell,not a problem. We brought along air fresheners. Same goes for the toilet area. We didn't find it to be as small as some stated. There is a good amount storage space in the closets etc and an easy to use safe. The t.v. gets New York stations so if you feel the need to keep up with US news, you can. We enjoyed our break from the nonstop Britney Spears saga for a week! LOL Contrary to what Ive read, AC does work when you are out of the room. YOu just need to shut the balcony door and it kicks on. The beds was hard as previously reported but we found it very comfortable. We sleep on a really nice mattress at home and were concerned but it was for naught. They brought twin beds in for the kids and they fit fine in the room.Food: It was good. Not fantastic, not bad. Some things were done better than others but we never went hungy. We weren't impressed with the teppanyaki grill. The food was okay but the show part was nonexistent. Not a big deal but if you are going looking for the whole experience, it's just not there. The main buffet was the best.. For dinner, they grill boneless chicken breast, fish etc right in front of you. It was very good. At lunch, we opted not to make the trek to the lobby for the better food because for us, sitting in an open air restaurant with a view of the ocean was worth having fewer choices. Breakfast was always well done. Dominican coffee was the best ! The kids loved the warm milk each morning to make their own hot chocolate. We did book the dinner romantica on the beach one eveing for my husband and I. I highly recommend it! The food was the best we had all vacation and the ambiance and service were top notch. Can't say enough good things about that experience. Any foodborne issues can't be solely attributed to poor food handling by the staff. We saw people use their fingers to pick up food from the buffet, take food, bite it and put it back and worst of all, a child take their finger, run it over one side of tongs, lick their finger to taste and then do it over the other side to taste again and then put the tongs back in the dish. His father then proceeded to do the same.Staff: So much has been made of rudeness. I have never in my life seen such rude people. NOT THE STAFF BUT THE TOURISTS. Hello, please, thank you, excuse me. That's all you need to know to get good, courteous service. If you can say them in spanish, even better. The staff appreciates any effort made to speak their language. There are even spanish lessons every day at 10:30 for anyone who feels they have a major language barrier. One evening while my family and I were enjoying dinner, a group came into the restaurant and started rearranging tables. It was a sit down restaurant where a host seated you and sent a waiter over to wait on you. They chose not to wait. This woman approached our table and waved her hand (no excuse me etc.) and asked You speak English. We said yes, and she asked us How does this work? We told her that appetizers and dessert were buffet but you order dinner etc. She said OH, turned on her heels and walked away. The staff was treated even more rudeley including the party of 12 flagging down the waiters, waving glasses in the air with the other hand thrown up and a very loud UH? white whine? I've never seen anything like it in my life. We also watched a group of tweens who ran around the resort for the entire week unattended. We saw them dump the contents of tea bags on the table, pour drinks over onto tables and one bragging about how he almost had to kick a French guys *^. We were embarrassed by the behavior as the perpetrators were from the US. Bottom line, you reap what you sow. The drinks were good. I know some people said they weren't strong enough. If you wanted more liquor, you could just ask for it. I thought they were good as is. Presidente beer was excellent. Bubba Kegs are a good idea if you want to grab a drink and want it to stay cool for a few hours at the pool or beach. Resort in general: The pool was fantastic. Very clean and well kept. You could find a quiet area under a palapa or a lively area near the swim up bar. Perfect. The plaza bar was a fun place to gather at night. There was live music and candlelit tables that provided a comfortable space for drinks before or after dinner. The lobby was also a nice place to relax. We only made it to 2 shows. Both were put on by outside acts. They were just okay- a little cheesy but a fun evening none the less. As some said, there is some wear and tear but there is also constant maintenance being done. I hate to say it, but based on the behavior we witnessed from some people, I would think that the wear and tear is due more to people disrespecting property than lack of maintenance. We always had plenty of towels etc. No bug issues and nobody spraying chemicals that we saw. Conclusion: We had a terrific time at the Majestic. We did have some stomach issues but we can't attribute them to the resort. The week we left, a local school was closed because of a gastrointestinal illness so it was rampant in our area. I took pepto daily and was fine. I did this as a precaution because we were drinking more alcohol and eating more than usual- it's vacation! As far as being a 5 star resort, I never believed that and still don't. I would give it 3.5 - 4 stars- above average. You need to go with an open mind as life is different in the DR. The staff works hard but they do it a little slower. They are friendly and happy and will always greet you with a hello, how are you. Just do the same and things will be fine. I think some folks who live in major metropolitan areas have a tough time with that slow down as their lives are so harried on a daily basis. Relax, take a deep breath it's your vacation!

<Content>amazing grounds The grounds of this hotel are spectacular and are kept in immaculate shape. The gorgeous pool that goes almost from hotel lobby to beach was put to great use and was an easy way to spend the day. We (4 couples) were very impressed with the staff who were very courteous and always helpful. The rooms were in need of some repair and our A/C broke near the end and was not fixed, although through no fault of the hotel. Our stay was enjoyable as far as the ammenities go but quite frankly, the food was a huge disappointment. When you pay a premium to go to a place such as this, I believe that the food should be top notch and it was far from it. Breakfast was acceptable but lunch and dinner were extremely poor and again for the money we paid, unacceptable. Although I cannot with total certainty say it was the food, all 8 of us got some form of stomach ailment plus my wife got a bladder infection. The whole experience should be a good one, not just pieces of it. Unfortunately food is a large piece. For this reason alone I put this experience at a 3 star rating and would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>great hotel!!! We just returned from the Majestic Colonial. We were three couples each with 1 child. Our age range was 11-56. We stayed on the first level, rooms 1121-1129. That was furthest away from the construction. Good location!! Close to the pool and beach. The pool and the beach were probably the nicest we've been to. (we've been to all-inclusives in Jamaica and Mexico). The swim up bar is fun. Always nice people there and make sure you ask Victor, (the nicest bartender) to make you one of his many 'Victor specials. Ask for the purple one if you like a berry taste. We did tip many of the bartenders, a few dollars put more alcohol in each drink. The fruity ones probably have 300 calories per drink so a few bucks made us drink less with the same result. The Animation staff is the greatest. If you want to get involved during the day just sit around near the pool bar. The staff will get you to play fun games that will make you laugh. Remember you will never see any of those people again so just join in. Beautiful Lina, funny Jimmy, Jesus and Samuel will get you to do as much as you want. We watched the aerobics every day and never participated once (too much drinkie drinkie.) But it was nice to watch Lina and Samuel get sweaty!! Definately learn the Taki Taki dance!! They taught it twice a day, complicated especially with a few drinks in you but very fun!! The last day we were there we asked them to put it on for us (Not the scheduled time) and they did AND they danced with us. They were all very accommodating!! They made the trip most enjoyable (if I had to choose one factor I think it would be them). The food got mixed reviews with our group. I felt it was fine, even very good. I loved the Chinese, the Japanese, and the Steak house. None of our group liked the Gourmet restaurant at all and the service was very slow. Mexican was just OK. Get the reservations early in the week for all of the restaurants that require them. The room was nice, but the jacuzzi is not behind a door so you have no privacy if you are sharing a room with kids/teens. I did leave new bottles of nail polish/make-up each day for the cleaning staff but there was no consistency with when they cleaned the room. I also don't think I got anything extra for leaving that stuff. Other reviews are talking about food/ flowers being left in the room, how did you get that stuff guys?? Our group did 3 excusions. Parasailing was fun. $80 for 2 people for 10 minutes. The only complaint was that when we took a walk down the beach we saw parasailors that were getting pulled by the boat, our guy just stayed put so we didn't get a change of scenery. We bought the photos that they took of us $14. A nice memory of the experience!! Some of the others in the group went 4 wheeling. They had a blast, although if you have long pants wear them because one of our party got burned on his leg from the burning pipe or the hot water splashing off the pipe. The last excursion was snorkeling with the sharks. No one really raved about that one because the sharks stay on the bottom and don't come near you. My sister-in-law stayed down the beach at the Rui Bamboo and they did not get bottled water. We had it in the room, we could ask for it any where. Just based on that they said they will stay at the Majestic next year.Photographers are everywhere they will take your photo with monkeys, snakes, etc. They will even do photo shoots if you want. The photos are $10 a piece but they are really beautiful. A nice memory of a wonderful trip. I don't know what all the complaining is about. The majestic was wonderful.

<Content>Loved the Magestic Colonial Punta Cana We spent a week at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana and highly recommend it. The hotel is excellent and the staff polite and friendly. Victor Pollantis the front desk manager goes beyond his line of duty to be helpful and is outstanding. He was courteous, polite and extremely helpful. The beach is fantastic with white sand and for miles you see the beautiful blue ocean especially from the ocean view rooms. The food is good and the activities a lot of fun. We used the TNT vacation and the direct flight offered by them was fabulous. We would love to go back.

<Content>simply amazing Amazing resort, beautiful atmosphere, never too crowded (we went during christmas (dec 18-28th) great service, lots of good food, the best scenery and overall our best bang for the buck carribian trip yet,Resort staff including the bartenders, waitresses and animation staff were like family by the end of the trip. Best bartenders: francis  juan of the lobby bar Animation team we got to love: Sandy, Pablo, Jonathan, Lina, Kelly, and Jimmy these guys were amazing, wonderful shows, funny, and very energetic. it was very hard to part with the crew on the final day (tears and emotion) I would recommend the majestic to anyone wanting a domicinian vacation. food was great, it wasnt 5-star gourmet but still very delicious with LOTS of variety. drinks were always availible and the bars spread out enough to always be on hand :D. entertainment was great, especially by the pool and night-time entertainers. beach was huge and never crowded. it was a little paradise within the heavenly tropics. I dont kno how ppl can complain about the service, jus dont be a [--] and demanding to the staff and they will be pleasent to you (just like any other place on earth). The grounds were clean, beautiful and soothing with the sounds of the ocean and live-evening entertainment All i can say is thank you Majestic it was a trip to remember, see you next year!

<Content>Perfect Vacation!! I read tons of the reviews before I booked here, so it is my turn to return the favor. (Sorry it took so long.)My mother and I stayed at the Majestic the last week in January and had a great time. We booked through Liberty travel, which arranged transfers through Prieto tours. We let the airport valet help us with our luggage, and this was definitely worth the few dollars in tip money. The bus ride took almost an hour because of traffic and an accident. It looks like they're building a new road, which should help in the future. Return trip also went smoothly.Check in went very smoothly and quickly. The Majestic drink tastes like a creamsicle! A nice welcome to the resort. The lobby was beautiful, as were the grounds. We we're directed to the room, and we're pleasantly surprised with the location and the view. I had emailed reservations asking for a room close to the beach and away from construction and this is what I got plus more. We had a great view of the pool and the beach. (yes, there is a railing in your line of sight, but it did not bother us.) The rooms were caribean style and clean. The bed is firm, but made for a great nights sleep. The bathroom door that everyone talks about is not a big deal. There was a complimentary room safe and minibar. The room smelled fine and we did not see any bugs.We spent our week at the beach, so I can't talk about the pool. There were always chairs and shade , either from the umbrellas or palm trees. Not too many people saving lounge chairs. The water was a little rough, but the view was spectacular. We brought bug spray, but didn't use any of it. There usually was a nice breeze. We walked almost an hour to the shops. Not really worth it. Definitely know how much you want to spend, because the price you're given is ridiculous.Once we figured out the food, we we're fine. There are many choices to accomodate different tastes, and it's better to stick with what you know, instead of trying something that you don't recognize. If you don't like something, don't eat it and find something else. We would have breakfast at the main buffet, and the omelets and made to order eggs we're definitely the way to go. The line would move fast. We ate lunch at the beach restaurant because we enjoyed the view. The food would quickly change over, so if you don't see anything you like, wait and see what comes out next. We never got a hamburger because they would disappear so quick. (Some reviews have discussed the hamburgers, but when they're gone they are replaced with some kind of patty that kind of looks like a hamburger but isn't.) Grilled chicken was always excellent. The hibachi restaurant was fun, and the gourmet was the best. Dominican was OK. We did not have any problems making reservations. We did not get sick. Service was usually pretty good, but sometimes we we're overlooked. This was when it was extremely busy and the staff was almost running to keep up. Understandable. We watched 1 1/2 shows and they were OK. Not really our thing. Also, did not hit the clubs or casino. Not what we came for.Things I found helpful:We brought lot of ones.Before we went back to our room, we would get more bottled water at the bar. (never a problem) Helpful, if you drink coffee.We brought insulated mugs. I will do this on all tropical vacations!Be courteous, speak spanish. Hola, Buenas dias, muy bien, and gracias go a long way. I thought the staff was very friendly.Ask for washcloths. They have them, but not standard. (Is this a European thing, because my mom had the same problem in Paris.)Denny the beach concierge is great. It was great meeting you. Sorry it took so long to write. The next time I return I will speak more spanish.

<Content>Not impressed Went here for a wedding. Wedding was well done but lots of additional charges for the bride and groom. Resort was not a 5 star. More like a large 3 star. Though fairly new it was in need of repairs. Rooms are adequate but we had a great view of the tree line separating us from the resort next door. It would have been nice to have lounge chairs on the balcony. Room was cleaned at varying times during the day. Make sure you put the dead bolt on the door when in the room because they will come in with you there. It did not help to give a tip to the maid. We still did not have pillow cases one night and for much of the week we had no face cloths. Tipping the waiters did not insure prompt service either. Food was not very good. Everyone in our group got travellers diarrhea and nausea towards the end of the week.. A group of 50 Americans were also all sick. One of our group was stuck in the elevator one night and had to be pulled out between floors by 5 staff members. Poorly laid out facility. Long walk to everything and difficult to get around the pool with only two bridges. Not a good spot for a disabled person.

<Content>the best beach consierges ever My husband and I just got home yesterday from the M.C. we went down for a wedding,We fell in love with this resort.The restaurants were all very good.My favorite was the gourmet,out of all the eaterys you only have to reserve this one and the Matsuri. The beach was beautiful ,as are the people.We`ve traveled alot over the past ten years and I`d have to say this resort will go to the top of our list as one of the finest.The rooms are large and well maintained.We had champaine in the room w/a couple of glasses to greet us, we added some bubbles to the tub ...I`ll tell you what, it was the beginning of a beautiful vacation .It was sunny everyday so we spent the majority of our trip on the baech. They have beach consierges that waist no time in serving up what ever you would like to drink.The consiege that looked after us was named Denny,he was a pleasure to talk to,he spoke very good english and was very knowledgeable about the area.we look forward to our next trip and who knows maybe we`ll land in the D.R next year thank you to the staff of M.C. for such great service we came home feeling veryrelaxed, pampared and ready to get back to work.To all of you positive travelers out there you`ll find the pro`s out way the cons 100 to 1! ....Enjoy.

<Content>Second time to the Majestic Colonial and still very pleased My husband and I just returned from our second trip to the Majestic (2/13-2/18). I was a little concerned because the recent reviews weren't very favorable but once again the Majestic didn't let us down. Upon check in we asked for a room upgrade since we were returning customers and got a great pool side room on the first floor by the beach with a jacuzzi and 2 lounge chairs and a cafe set. Yes there is construction of their new hotel and we requested to be far away as they start early in the morning. We were greeted by Benito a member of the guest services staff. He escorted us to our room to make sure it was to our liking. At that time we told him what dinner reservations we wanted for the Japanese Steak house and the Gourmet restaurant. Within 15 minutes he called us and gave us our reservations and that he would leave them under our door. We enjoyed our complimentary Majestic breakfast outside on our patio which included lots of fresh fruit and freshly made breakfast rolls and muffins along with coffee, champagne and orange juice! Several afternoons we received a plate of fruit and a bottle of wine or sushi with wine. On valentine's day I got a rose and my husband a red t-shirt and a bottle of sparkling rose. The hotel is still spotless both inside and out. Yes at one time the ladies room was out of soap but that can happen anywhere. They are always keeping up with maintainence and it shows. The ancilliary staff don't go out of their way to say hello but if you habla en espanol un pequito they are quite surprised and pleased. The staff that come in contact with the guests always greet you and are very pleasant. Now if you you never want your glass empty speak to Ishmael or Yaser at the pool bar. They were making me stoli mojitos with equal instead of sugar....now that's service! The pool was spotless and clear. Plenty of beach chairs poolside and by the beach. Yes if you want a certain chair and a table you need to reserve it but we never had any trouble. I hope that the beach doesn't become to crowded after the addition of the new hotel. The sand is beautiful and the ocean color magnificant. I think they may have even dredged the beach because we both remember some rocks last year where the waves break but never encountered them. The other restaurants that don't require reservations are fine. We ate a lot of lobster, shrimp and beef. I think the lunch is better in the main hotel as opposed to by the beach. There is a bigger selection and more healthy items plus the thin crust pizza is delicious. My husband played golf twice and I used the Spa. The massage was better last year but maybe it was the masseuse. I would definitely still recommend this hotel and we probably will go back next year and maybe stay at the new one if it is complete!

<Content>Do not go there Just came back from Punta Cana (yesterday) after 2 weeks. We were there previously (last year) so were excited to go. We read mixed reviews on this resort but thought we'd make up our own minds.If you are thinking of going to Punta Cana and this is your first time there, DO NOT stay at the Majestic. Last year we stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe and loved it. The people were very friendly and helpful, the food was amazing and always changing - plus there was a lot to do.The Majestic staff are rude (this includes upper management) and not friendly or helpful. For the first week we had to ask daily for towels as there was 3 of us in a room. We even wrote a note, drew a picture and showed the maids how many people stayed in the room. They said ya, ya but we never did get 3 towels.The food was the same and never hot (eggs were ALWAYS cold unless you had an omelet made but you had to wait in a huge line-up to get one). The buffet at the Bahia changed every day, so for 7 days you ate a different meal each evening. They also had a lot of Dominican meals to choose from. At the Majestic it was the same fries, pizza and warm pasta (plus other meat) and in and day you. The a la carts were a joke. Their Italian restaurant was part of the main buffet, the Chinese was part of the Japanese restaurant, the Mexican part of the Dominican restaurant and seafood was part of the steakhouse.Everyone in our group - there were about 20 of us. We drank the bottled water and brushed our teeth with bottled water but everyone was still sick. It doesn't help that when people are walking around looking at what to eat, they start picking at the food with their hands instead of the tongs supplied! Manners still apply when on holidays people!The beach isn't that great and there is a lot of coral about 10 feet out. Do wear beach socks if you are going into the water. We were snorkeling out there are where you walk there is a lot of sea urchins in the coral.For a resort that is only about 3 years only it looks in horrible condition. The area around the pool has broken down so much that you need to wear flip flops otherwise you'll be stepping on little pieces of cement. The open concept toilet, bath tub and shower aren't very attractive and if you are a large person or very tall, you'll have problems in the toilet area. We had problems with the water draining away from the drain in the shower and had water all over the floor, the faucets weren't put on so you had to be careful turning water on (this goes for the public washrooms as well), there were cracks in the walls and we did have visitors at night even though we didn't have food in our rooms - yes cockroaches! The sliding doors never locked - even on the 1st floor. The main room doors had holes in them so you could literally see through them.I could go on and on, but if you are really interested in going here email me and I'll answer any questions you have.

<Content>Mucho Majestic We travelled with four other couples this month to the Majestic Colonial. We have stayed at several other resorts in the Dom Rep over the last few years and we all agree Majestic was the best. We previously stayed at the Iberostar and Gran Bahia resorts--we enjoyed our vacations every time, but this resort earned a few extra points for friendliness of staff, food and the pool.Pool: winds through the resort like a river; wide in some areas and narrow in others. The depth never exceeds 4ft. Water is clean and refreshing. We have played the towel game at every other resort we've stayed at and found it simply wasn't necessary here. There are always plenty of lounge chairs in every area of the pool and along the beach.Beach: clean, soft and HOT! Tried boogie boarding--we looked ridiculous, but had a lot of laughs. Try the water sports if you're up for it...Food: plentiful. Surprisingly good beef at the restaurants. Abundant choices at the buffets. The lobster was undercooked at the seafood restaurant, but ask for it to be grilled some more and problem solved. Keep a watchful eye on the doneness of your meat/fish, don't assume.Drinks: Coco Loco, Dirty Monkey, Pina Colada, The Majestic...all wonderful. Smirnoff and Stoli available for vodka drinks. Try the Majestic--we received one upon arrival and continued ordering them all week. Mamajuana is the local drink--it takes some getting used to (local barks and spices soaked in rum), but the effect is somewhere between caffeine and too many Martinis. Got the giggles during more than one mamajuana session.Restaurants: we loved that you only needed to make reservations at the Gourmet and theJapanese show restaurants...other resorts you need reservations for every meal that's not at a buffet. Food and service was fine. The Japanese show restaurant was not authentic Japanese, it was basically a stir fry. That was fine though, the majority of us aren't into sushi and other delicacies of the Japanese diet, but thought we'd enjoy the show. Try the pasta bars at the restaurants and buffets...yummy. They make your pasta dish to order with several pastas and sauces to choose from. Rooms: well appointed, sunny colors, colonial-tropical feel. Bed was firm which my husband and I loved. Slept soundly each night. Okay, the cocktails and full meals every day may have accounted for some of that restful sleep. No charge for the room safes, plenty of space for clothing. Some folks seemed to have issues with the bathroom setup--I don't see the problem, the shower was large and the bathroom stall was smallish. You're only in their to take care of your business, how much room do you need? As far as privacy in the bathroom--you really should have those issues worked out long before you decide to room together. Dual vanities, hairdryer, outlet in the bath area for curling irons, etc. Iron and board in the closet. Satellite TV with plenty of stations. Our maid was okay, not terribly consistent with the time of day the room got cleaned. We had some chocolates and my husband's Valentine's Day card stolen, but we're fairly certain that was the man who fills the room fridge as that's where the items were and the maid had cleaned prior to him coming in to restock. Luckily I had already inhaled most of the homemade chocolates. Hope he liked the card. Staff: friendly, friendly, friendly. Always willing to help you along with your Spanish or refresh a drink. These folks work day and night and still smile all the time. The Animation Team is awesome. We did water aerobics almost every day and felt great. We're not the most energetic group and we take our relaxing VERY seriously, but this was a lot of fun and what the heck, you're in the water anyway.Health: we take an Immodium each morning and some OTC Zantac and have never suffered from intestinal distress. We eat whatever we want and drink far too many combos of fruity/creamy tropical drinks. I guess you just have to know your innards. I bring bug lotion each year and have never needed it. For the last few hundred of us that still smoke (bad, I know), the cigs can be had at the Cigar Shop for $6 US. That's about what we pay here in good ol' Tax 'Em Till Ya Kill 'Em New York.They have several gift shops at the resort, but wait for Market night to do your shopping. A little haggling and you can fare far better. It's usually mid-week. Casino was fairly big and lots of machines and a few tables. I don't gamble, but the members of our party who do said it was fine. One guy even came back with more money than he went with!Bring about $200 US singles for tips. Couple of bucks can go a long way with these folks. Spread the wealth! You're on vacation for Pete's sake! We tipped $5 per couple when we all went together to eat and that seemed to be very appreciated. We'd tip a couple of bucks with every drink order delivered too (it was always a tray full---did I mention we drink far too much?) and the waitress made sure we had whatever we needed for the entire week--be it more ice or mucho rum.Enjoyed our stay and have already planned on returning to the Majestic next year.I'm sure I've forgotten something, but if anyone has questions, feel free to contact me.If anyone was there between Feb.12-19: we were the bunch of old folks with the Booze Barge near the swim-up bar.

<Content>Loved This Majestic Colonial It was my husband and my first time to the Dominican Republic and would definitey go back and stay at the Majestic Colonial. It was absolutely beautiful. When we arrived I asked Roberto at the reception desk if we had a pool view room and after looking at where our room was located we realized it wasn't. I asked him if we could get a pool view room and boy did he take care of us!! We almost died when we got to our room. He had upgraded us to a Suite with free room service at no extra charge. The beach was beautiful and so was the pool. The food was good, we ate at a different restaurant every night. Service was excellent and the shows were fun!! Beware of the Mamajuana :-)Definitely great place to stay! Can't wait to go back!! FYI-met a lot of people on the ATV excursion from other resorts that were not happy with where they were staying. They weren't able to swim at there beaches becasuse it was too rough and they said they had the same food everynight. One resort actually closed down everynight at 10:00pm.

<Content>Excellent resort--overbooked We had a wonderful time at the Majestic and thoroughly enjoyed the staff and surroundings. We did have poor initial impression when we arrived thinking we were going to our ocean view room, only to have a direct view of the neighboring construction zone. We called the front desk and were told they were overbooked and wouldn't have an ocean view room available for another couple weeks. I don't mind if the room wasn't available, but the front desk staff could have explained or offered some sort of compensation. Another couple in our group paid for an ocean view room and got it after slipping the front desk staff a five dollar bill. Of the four couples in our group, only one couple got the room they paid for. Based on this experience, I would be hesitant on purchasing an upgraded room if returning to the Majestic.Despite the room confusion, we had an absolute wonderful time and would definitely go back to the Majestic.

<Content>Great Beach, All Around Good Resort Our first trip to DR, my husband and I have just returned from a stay at Majestic Colonial Feb. 14-19. In the past, my husband and I have traveled in the Caribbean and stayed at other all-inclusive resorts, so we had a pretty good idea of what to expect. The beach in Punta Cana is excellent, probably the best I've ever seen. Powdery, clean sand, stretching for miles, and noticeably less crowded right outside of the resort. Palm trees everywhere, picture perfect gorgeous. We were also pleased to see an absence of pesky vendors selling their wares so you could stroll down the beach in relative peace. There was always a stiff breeze the entire time during our visit, so the surf was a bit rough for beach front snorkeling or sea kayaking. We had no issues with check-in, and the front desk staff (Bernice and Janet) were especially gracious, escorting us to the room and describing the amenities as we went. Room was beautiful, spacious, very clean, and housekeeping was reasonable. The only minor complaint was the low powered mini-fridge which was not able to chill down the contents very quickly. The room was equipped with a coffee maker and espresso maker, a nice touch.True to the many reviews on this site, the food was average, but nothing to get excited about. Plentiful and a fair selection at the buffets, but relatively bland and never very warm. We found the best food at Rodeo House (grilled meats) and the Carribean restaurant. The Gourmet was a little nicer presentation and taste, but not so great that I would go out of my way to make a reservation. We also found the drinks at the bars to be relatively light on the alcohol. El Presidente is the only beer offered at the resort, and if you are a fan of spicy bloody marys, you will be in heaven.The pool was beautiful, very clean, a bit chilly, and generally there were enough chairs at mid-day if you hunted around a bit. The grounds are beautiful and there is constant attention to upkeep. The main gathering hall is absolutely grand in scale and very inviting for enjoying a before-dinner cocktail. We were disappointed in the live music selection but this seems to be our experience at most Caribbean resorts.A final comment. Very few of the staff speak English, but that makes if fun trying to communicate and you get to learn some Spanish during your trip. In general, the staff were genuinely pleasant and prompt and made us feel very comfortable.All in all, we strongly recommend this resort as long as you aren't searching for gourmet cuisine. A great place to simply relax and enjoy the beautiful beach of Punta Cana.

<Content>Second visit ot the Majestic My wife and I just returned from a two-week stay at the Majestic...Feb. 2-Feb.16, 2008.We were there last year for two weeks and decided to return this year, in spite of some negative reviews.Were we satisfied? Absolutely!The weather was perfect. The staff were very accommodating and went out of their way to make us feel welcome.We knew what to expect since we were returnees and we were not disappointed!We met some nice folks from other parts of the globe and got to know some of the staff.I said this in a testimonial last year...if you go with a bad attitude and treat the staff with a surly attitude, don't expect them to embrace you!We were upbeat and friendly and treated the staff accordingly!A smile and a tip go a long way!The visitors who write negative reviews, in my opinion, are people who want to pay a 3 star price yet expect five star service.You won't be disappointed by staying at the Punta Cana Majestic!We went there two times in a row and will likely return in Feb.2009.Feel free to contact us at the following address if you want specific questions answered.barker@nbnet.nb.ca

<Content>Fun in the sun!!! We have just returned from soaking in the sun at the Majestic! Upon arrival, we were taken to our rooms and were blown away at how beautiful the grounds were. The rooms were very nice, but inconsistent as far as if you get animal towels with flowers or not. And the privacy thing, the toilet has a door but it isn't a full door and it is frosted glass.The beach was great with very white sand. It was fun going in the ocean. There were some topless women and some old guys with man thongs (yuck!) Denny, the only waiter on the beach was very nice. And Daniel was funny and cool. We went on two excursions. The outback jungle safari, which I booked online. It was informative and a lot of fun. The other was zip lines which we booked there. That too was awesome. The only bad things about the place was bug bites and not enough servers by the beach and pool. You have to go get your own drinks usually. One day I was sick., but I don't know if it was the food or not. But overall it was a wonderful vacation. Make sure you try a Majestic (what a great drink)!

<Content>Mixed feelings. My wife and I just returned from the MC 鈥?Jan, 18-27. Previously we have been to Jamaica twice, Mexico twice and Dominican Republic twice (Puerto Plata and La Romana), so we have something to compare this experience with.We booked the Majestic suite, and guess what? On our arrival there were no rooms of this type available, despite my advance reservation and an e-mail exchange with Roberto . So we鈥檝e been downgraded to the regular suite for the first night. In return we have been offered a free massage (which we didn鈥檛 want), and free late check-in (which we didn鈥檛 need). The front desk lady was completely useless, running between us and her manager until I suggested that we would rather speak directly to him. Based on other reviews, it looks like the overbooking of more expensive suites may be standard practice for MC. However, the suite we received on the second day was great.Another disappointment with the front desk was their complete inability to help us with the coffee-maker 鈥?nobody showed up to assist us after 3 calls.The beach is beautiful, probably the best we had ever seen. MC beach was far less crowded then the neighboring Bahia and Riu. The ocean is not as quiet as in Jamaica or in La Romana, and the swimming area is pretty limited. Maybe Punta Cana is just not my place.The food was OK, the main buffet had plenty of variety, but, as was already mentioned in one of the reviews, the food is not labeled. So if you have any dietary restrictions it might be a problem. The 鈥淔rench鈥?restaurant was OK, the Chinese-Japanese so-so. And I caught a stomach virus during the last day of our stay (first time that ever happened to me in the Caribbean). So no really good impressions from food.Another disappointment was the complete absence of birds and small animals 鈥?the usual part of any Caribbean resort. In MC they have 2 cages with 2 parrots in one of them, and 6-8 pigeons in the other one. I found this strange 鈥?in contrast we saw plenty in La Romana, only 1.5 hours of driving from MC.

<Content>Beautiful Majestic Colonial My husband and I and another couple stayed at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana from February 2 thru February 16. We enjoyed 2 wonderful weeks of relaxation, delightful entertainment and good food. We read many reviews on Trip Advisor prior to selecting the Majestic for our two week stay. The rooms were clean, the pool was wonderful, and the grounds were immaculate. Every day we saw several workers making sure the entire resort was presentable. Most every day, the groundskeepers picked up leaves from our yard (even if they saw just one leaf). There was also quite a bit of security around the facility. One evening my husband and I took a walk near the beach and found 4 security personnel watching the beach area. We felt very safe everywhere at this resort.Most of the staff, with the exception of our maid spoke English. As with most countries, some people spoke better English than others. What I found amazing is that a good number of the staff spoke quite a bit of French and English. During our stay there was a large population of Canadians at the resort who spoke French. Most announcements were made in Spanish, English and French (and sometimes German). Everyone we encountered at the resort was pleasant and very friendly. No matter who we passed in the halls, on the beach, or wherever we went they all said 鈥渉ola鈥? and did it with a smile!There was a wide variety of food choices available, and nobody should leave there hungry. There were several dishes that I wouldn鈥檛 touch because I鈥檓 not that adventurous, but for a person who likes to try food from another country, this is a place to do it. At the buffet we found Dominican dishes being served as well as many American dishes. There was always a wide variety of breads, meats, desserts, fruits and veggies to choose from. We really enjoyed the Japanese restaurant, the Gormet restaurant, and the Mexican/Dominican restaurant. We preferred not to eat at the place near the beach (the steakhouse and Mexican restaurant in the Palapa Hut) because there were generally quite a few flies around.Overall we enjoyed our stayed tremendously and would stay there again without a doubt!

<Content>Maybe not 鈥淢ajestic鈥?but not as horrible as we feared it would be... Not a 5-star, expect a 4-star and you won鈥檛 be disappointed鈥?br/>Our stay : Jan 25 - Feb 1st. My husband and I had booked this hotel back in November, when the reviews on Trip Advisor were great and the Majestic was ranked # 1 in Punta Cana.! In December, the comments became very scary: terrible food, food poisoning, rude staff, bad service, bugs, everything to make you want to cancel because you鈥檙e thinking this is going to be a nightmare! Though it did start on a bad note upon our arrival, the remaining of our stay was mostly enjoyable鈥?So here's the good, the bad and the ugly! Check-in - front desk : Bad : Booked a Garden View Jr. Suite requesting specifically Building # 3. When we were given a room number in BLGD #1, at ground level, we said no, we asked for Building # 3 (our tour operator sent the request). Of course they gave us the usual: the hotel is booked, come back tomorrow. So we went to check out the room: it was horrible, run-down furniture, musty smell and a lovely view on a path way and a fence separating from the hotel next door, but certainly no garden view!!! We were tired, hungry and would not stay in that room! So my husband went back to the front desk and asked to speak with the manager. The manager said come back at 6 pm. My husband went back at 5 pm and asked again. Funny thing, the manager (Victor) did find us a room in BLGD #3, the hotel wasn鈥檛 booked after all鈥?br/>We moved to a huge room, on 3rd floor (on a corner) with a great view on gardens, pool, etc. Victor was helpful  professional and even sent us a note asking if everything was ok with new room. They seem to try to give out the crappy rooms first鈥?it鈥檚 a shame because it makes customers very unhappy (heard lots of complaints while at front desk) and it starts your vacation on the wrong foot. Unfortunately, you do have to complain and be very persistent鈥?Room:Good: Spacious Jr. Suite, clean: good maid service, no bugs, great balcony. Bad: Very firm (too hard!) mattress, cheap pillows  thin sheets; the infamous open bathroom: not a great concept; musty smell when AC not on; very echo hallways: a lot of late night partying in rooms (wedding after parties?) we were waken up 3 nights in a row! Got out of hand and security was finally called. Security should do rounds 鈥his is not a party place (not Cancun!)Beach - Pool - GroundsGood: great beach: soft white sand  you can walk for miles; Majestic鈥檚 beach was the nicest out of any of the resorts around it; clear blue-green water; we could always find a decent spot at pool or beach, even around 10 am. Nice pool design. Elevators available in buildings and lobby, resort just right size, easy walk to everywhere. Bad : beach is on the Atlantic coastline, not the Carribean, so when it鈥檚 very windy (and it was !), the waves can be rough - no snorkeling either...Pool water was very cold! Grounds are well kept, but too much bug spray, few flowers and no birds! or any wildlife around! ??Food - Drinks - Restaurants: We had been traumatized by the reviews regarding the food鈥kay, not the best by far, but still over all not bad and we were not sick! The Buffet (Supreme) was the best option, lots of choice; breakfast was great with chefs making crepes  omelets. That place is huge! Never waited to be seated, it鈥檚 clean but cafeteria-like ambiance  too dark at dinner time! Pleasant staff; service usually very efficient, except for one night was really off. Only 2 restaurants needed reservations : Japanese (didn鈥檛 go, too scared to get sick) and Gourmet (we canceled that one because was available only at 9:15 pm.). Seafood and Steakhouse are 2 open-air restaurants by the beach; every night there was a wedding reception going on there, so not quiet and romantic! But it was fun to have dinner outdoors (in January), staff was friendlier, happier, food was good, and the Sirloin steak was the only edible beef at that resort! These 2 restaurants become La Hispaniola by day where you can eat lunch by the beach, not very good, poor choice, but convenient if you want to grab a quick bite wearing your beach clothes. As for drinks, try the Majestic (best), others are so-so, Presidente beer is ok but their house wine (red or white) is the worst ever!Now the Ugly part : 鈥淭aino鈥?restaurant: Carribean-Mexican (what a joke!!), was the worst experience of our stay! The staff is sooo rude, it鈥檚 unbelievable! The unfriendly (I鈥檓 being polite, feel free to fill in with every nasty word you can imagine!) hostess? didn鈥檛 greet us and just pointed at a table; we asked for another table, by the window and she rolled her eyes at us and went away only to send over her manager, an angry little guy that yelled at us that we couldn鈥檛 sit at a table for 4 because we were only 2 (mind you the place was empty!). So we sat at table for 2: a waiter came to take our order without a smile, another rude one?? Seriously?  to top it off, the food was terrible! We just go up and left, this has never happened before at any resort anywhere!Entertainment:Was better then most resorts we went to! They had better sound system, the break-dancers were good but the M.C. is very annoying; these shows are sometimes corny  lame, but it鈥檚 the only entertainment available at night and most shows were watchable!Excursions:We had been to Saona Island before, so we did the Carribean Festival : snorkeling, swimming with nurse sharks and holding a live huge Stingray (got the pics!), was fun (try Mammajuanna drink!) but weather was bad and 78$ USD each for 陆 day trip is a little expensive.Shopping :Beware: sharks are not in the water! You need to bargain and stand your ground; the first price they give you is outrageous! You can walk down the beach (about 45 min!) to the flea market beach tents and buy Rum, cigars, coffee, Taino art. There is also a market in front of the hotel. Bad : the worst shopping experience is when vendors come to the hotel to sell their cheap stuff, they are aggressive! They will grab you  insist- very unpleasant! Good : We booked a free tour to a Jewelry/Cigar shop downtown Punta Cana (Arimar, Amber  real silver jewelry, nice original souvenirs).Over all, it was okay, but not sure we would go back鈥?we liked better Iberostar in Bahiahybe. Although P.C.鈥檚 Bavaro beach is gorgeous, we do love Mexico鈥檚 Mayan Riviera鈥?br/>Liked : beachDisliked : 鈥淭aino鈥?restaurant

<Content>Amazing Time!! This is going to be a pretty long in-depth review, but because I thoughroully read every review before going, I want to give specifics! My boyfriend and I are a couple in our mid twenties from Toronto that stayed at the Majestic from Feb9-16th. He has never been to a resort before, I have however been to many many resorts.Travel/check in and check out: We booked through an agent and flew with skyservice (found the leg room incredibly tight) and travelled with Sunquest (great company) the aiport in Dominican is open and beautiful, the flight, and airport/bus ride experiences were quick and easy.Upon arriving at the majestic we received a cool towel, a majestic virgin drink and we were informed that our room was not ready yet (it was 1:00) so we grabbed lunch and returned and it was ready. They gave us a room with 2 double beds by accident then quicky changed it to room 2305 with a king bed. I had asked for a room in building 2 and was incredibly happy with the room :)Room/Grounds: The room was beautiful, extremely lagre and clean. No musty smell the airconditioning worked amazing, we were actually cold alot :) The beds did however kill our backs but thats ok. There was towel art and a bottle of champagne given to us upon arrival. The grounds are incredibly beautiful and well maintained. There are 9 bars so pretty much everywhere u go you can find a drink. When checking in make your dinner reservations right away** There are always people working on the lawns and flowers so they really maintain the grounds very well. There are fountains everywhere, there is a sidestreet with shops the casino, theatre, sports bar and medical centre. And the beach isnt too far a walk from the lobby.Staff: Here is where I have to say I was shocked. I read so many reviews about people complaining about the staff. Please ignore them! I found from the first minute the staff was incredibly kind and accomodating., no matter whether you tipped or not (which we did) I left the maid a couple of dollars every day with a note and our room was cleaned every day, the fridge was restocked and we got beautiful towel art everyday! We came back after breakfast one day at 10am and the room had already been cleaned!! On valentines day she filled the tub with bubbles and rosepetals and it was so pretty. Everywhere I went everyone smiled and said hola! So please smile back to them, the wait staff was kind and quick to get you a drink, the guest services and concierge people were unbeleiveably kind and the best of all had to be the bartenders! Felix at the beach bar and the staff there were wonderful and always had a rum and coke ready for my boyfriend. beach: The beach I have to say was one of the best beaches I have ever been too, typically I dont swim in the ocean too much cause I hate stepping on random things that you cant see, but here the water was warm and clear and there was nothing but sand. If you went off to the left there were some rocks, and far out was the coral reef, but there was plenty of swimming space where it was just sand. We LIVED at the beach. Only once did I play the towel game and reserve a hut, other than that we went to the beach around 10-11:00 every day and got chairs and a hut with no problem. Excursions: We only did 1 excursion which was the dune buggy ride. We had a great time! Unfortuantly the guy advertises a natural cave that we stop and swim in which never happened, but the buggys are awesome, they are two seaters and we went with two other couple that we met on vacation (hi Graham, Nicole, Cindy and Johnny!!) The atv's however seemed to keep breaking down so I would recommend the dune buggys. Its $100 per couple and they take you out into the wilderness for a long time so its great (just be smart and dress properly because you will get very muddy!) The excursion stops at a womans house where she serves you coffee and you can buy from the shop there. Please bring some candy and little gifts for the kids there beacuse we felt bad that we didnt have anything. Food: The food was probably the only drawback for us. Please understand that it is not because the food wasnt good, it is only beacuse we are pretty picky eaters even in north america, I did get sick one night and towards the end of the trip only ate bread and rice, but my boyfriend ate pretty much everything and was fine. We ate at the Steakhouse (the chateaubriand was really good) the dominican (the fajitas and nachos were awesome) and the Japanese (the teppanyaki tables are really fun and they give you alot of food) We also did the romantic dinner in the private gazeebo for Valentines dinner and they went all out decorating it with rose petals, and candles and we had a private table for 2 with our own waiter, it was fabulous. The regular buffets were good too, there are alot of options.Entertainment: We only caught 1 show which was the michael jackson show it was hilarious to see audience members dancing, we went to the casino alot and I won $80 although they didnt seem to like us much there, especially when we were winning. And we had a couples massage at the spa on valentines day which was amazing, the spa is really beautiful, be sure to check it out! *as a side note please tip, it may not seem like much to you, but a little tip can go a long way*To sum it up we had a really great vacation, I was nervous after having read some bad reviews closer to us going, but I realise either these people were expecting something that was unrealistic (please remember this is NOT north america a 5* there is about a 3* here although I do feel this hotel is a solid 5*) or they simply are peole that cannot be pleased. Just go with an open mind, relax and enjoy the amaing hotel and wonderful staff, I look forward to returning to the majestic in the future.If anyone has any questions please feel free to email me at Eleni4255@hotmail.com. Thanks :)

<Content>Going back next year for certain! I just returned from the Majestic Colonial after a week's vacation with my boyfriend and another couple and the 4 of us are already looking at next year's trip!We read every review of this property and had our reservations before arriving. Within minutes, we were overwhelmed by just how much the Majestic exceeded not only our expectations, but our hopes.Richard and Rafael both offered their services in ensuring we had the rooms we wanted (2 next to one another in building 3 closer to the beach) and the opportunity to make reservations at both Le Gourmet and Matsuri.Our rooms were gorgeous, spacious and well tended to. The property was spectacular and the constant maintenance by the staff is remarkable. The pool and beach couldn't be more impressive.We particularly enjoyed omlettes in the beach palapa each morning with Felix, the Rodeo restaurant (and Omar!) I have traveled extensively in Southeast Asia, Europe and the U.S. Truly, this resort ranks among my top trips.

<Content>Great Stay We had a wonderful stay at the Majestic, food was very good, great variety, large amount of fresh fruit and vegtables. Rooms were great too. They had down graded my room but it was wonderful and they more than made up for it in ammenities. Victor is the manager/supervisor and I can't say enough about him. He is willing to work with you and he will listen and he speaks English......Thank you Victor you sold me on this resort...Also Denny, he is a beach concierge, always a smile on his face, tried to help us understand things about Punta Cana, was always just steps away to get us drinks and keep us happy. He is proud to work at the Majestic and really enjoys his job. The resort as a whole deserves 5 stars in our opinion.....We will go again soonWeather was warm and wonderful

<Content>Majestic Colonial Amazing AGAIN!!! This being our 3rd time to the resort we were impressed again. The food was wonderful, and the selection was vast! Drinks were delicious. Rum punch was one of my favorites, but also dont forget the Majestic with Rum!!! The beach was beautiful. We never had a problem find a chair. Same for the pool. This resort is not over crowded so you dont have to worry about getting to the beach at 7am to 'reserve' your spot. The waitstaff (Nelson!!), bartenders (Rosa and William, just to name a few), Entertainment crew (Rey, Jesus, and crew), and Aurelio in the front office were delightful. They are so friendly and eager to please. We had a delightful time. The rooms are gorgeous. The bed was very comfortable. We had a room right on the pool. It was very convenient! Also since it was our anniversary (we were married at the Majestic last year), our room was filled with Roses on arrival and chilled Champagne. Each night we would get a treat of some sort (cheese platter, fruit platter, white chocolate covered grapes!!!, pink champagne). The Japanese restaurant is very fun, but be sure to make your reservations AS SOON as you check in, as it fills up fast. The Fajitas and Rice at the Mexican restaurant are delicious, and do not miss the Chateau Briand (sp) at the Steak House.I cannot say enough nice things about the Majestic Colonial. We traveled with 20 people and everyone wants to go back again next year, most people traveling with us this year were repeat guest as well.

<Content>Great resort! We just arrived back home from a wonderful Valentine's week at the Majestic Colonial. Our room was fantastic and the staff took very good care of us. We were there over Valentine's day and the little extras left in the room made for a very romantic ambience. The most enjoyment was on the beach where we were wonderfully taken care of by Denny, the Beach Concierge. He was always very friendly and helpful. His English was probably the best that we encountered so visiting with him was very educational and fun. Thanks Denny!!The North Dakota crew!!

<Content>Nice but would not go back My boyfriend and I recently took a trip to the Majestic in January. The resort is very nice with lush landscaping and is very clean. Although we had a good time there were some problems.Our room was not ready when we first checked in which is not that big of a problem because we spent time at the bar. However, we were told to come back in 30 minutes and the room would be ready. Of course we came back and then they told us another 35 minutes..so we waited for a while for the room. The check-in process itself is very chaotic and the staff are just running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The one thing we were very upset about was the fact that they had us checking out a day earlier. Thank goodness the departure bus service (which you have to register with so you can find out what time your bus is leaving) noticed that they had us leaving the wrong day. Well, trying to correct that was hell!!! They kept telling us we had to prove to them that we were staying til the 31st and not the 30th...well, that was pretty hard to do since THEY had our itinerary which they requested when we checked in. All in all, we were able to fix it.The pool and beach are very nice and we had no problems getting towels or lounge chairs....The food is bland...and they DO NOT label anything at their buffets so you are constantly walking around wondering what the food actually is. Plus, every buffet is the same. The only restaurant that was good was the Le Gourmet. Get reservations and eat there. The chinese and steakhouse restaurants are decent as well.The rooms are ok. The bed was like sleeping on the floor. The mattress was so hard. I have never slept on something so hard in my life. The bathroom is tiny...well the toilet area...You feel cloisterphobic if you shut the door to use the bathroom...The shower is big enough to fit five adults and I cant understand why they made that so big and the toilet so small. Also, room location is key. We paid for an upgrade to have a pool side room, which was nice..but BEWARE. My boyfriend and I are not partiers. We like to relax when we go away. It was very hard to do this at Colonial Majestic. They have weddings here daily..which is fine during the day..but at night, the wedding receptions are held at the pool bar which is right smack in the middle of all the rooms....and of course, right in front of hours. So from 7pm to 12am every single night, we had to listen to loud music and hollering guests. I mean, I'm all for having fun at weddings, but this resort needs to find a reception area that does not interfere with its other guests. I did not pay for a five star resort to hear someones wedding all night long. Plus, you can hear the entertainment from other areas of the resort as well. The only way for peace and quiet is to book a room by the ocean, but this resort is not worth all that money.The weather was beautiful and we enjoyed relaxing by the pool everyday....but we will never go back to Majestic. Take this review as you see fit. I read all reviews before I went and I took the positive ones over the negatives...wish I didnt do that....Think about it before you book.

<Content>Quite pleased with the Majestic....... We just got back and loved the week in punta cana at the Majestic.....I was a bit worried before going due to some of the concerning reviews, but we had a great stay...no issues. We did NOT have ANY STOMACH illness, never saw roaches or had any bug bites... The staff was very friendly and quite fun to be honest! The casino was a bit small but it was never too crowded!The Michael Jackson show was awesome ....for an island gig!!!The Disco was alot of fun....the staff went out of their way daily to say hola and to ask how we were and if we needed anything! We were impressed at how friendly they were...but then again we do live in boston!! We went on a half day trip to see some other areas of the island ...a familys home , a coffee farm and even to see a school where we visited with some children. We even lost our camera during the off hotel day and the place we booked the trip through found it and brought it back to us the next day...that was impressive! We have been to Aruba twice and was a bit hesitant to try some other place...but we would absolutely go back to the D.R. and back to the Majestic! Don't be worried....we truly enjoyed the Majestic!!!

<Content>Majestic Colonial, Punta Cana We just returned from 5 days at the Majestic Colonial and had a great time! The buildings and grounds are beautiful and meticulous. The staff is everywhere and couldn't do enough for us. The food was very good altho' our only complaint is that it is not kept hot enough on the buffets. The pool is huge and winds its way through the entire resort and the beach is , of course, gorgeous. One of our group went parasailing  said the rate ($45) is cheaper then Mexico or the Caribbean. We did tip xtra most of the time as they try so hard to please you. Here's to Cesar on the beach and Joel in the Palapa !!

<Content>wow once again This was our third visit at the majestic and once again it was perfect. We had a little problem when we got there but it was soon revolved by Ricardo. Ricardo is super; he's in charge of public relations and I must say he does a really good job. THANK YOU Ricardo for your help and for the bouquet of roses.The rooms are super, but the maid in our section wasn't a cleaning freck. The food was super as usually; we especially love the grill for dinner. The lobster is wonderful.We had a blast with the animation team. Ray and Daniel were the best. Taking time to talk to everyone, always smiling. We really had fun with Ray because he talks a little bit in french and each time he would want to know a word in french he would ask us. GREAT JOB Ray and Daniel (Peluche) keep up the good work. Another person that I must talk about is Michaella at the pool bar. She is wonderful; always smiling. She takes time to speak to everyone, even to us and she speaks only in spanish but she does everyone so that we can understand what she is saying. So, we learned alot of spanish with her and she learned alot of french. Continue your good work mIchaella, see you in AprilThe beach is wonderful but the service for drinks on the beach is so so. There were two person in charge of service on the beach and most frankly they were very slow and sometimes hard to find. Hiding in the shade instead of working. We are planning to go back in April with another couple and our choice will be the Majestic once again. The room are superbe and the site is beautiful all the way.This is a site that everyone should visit, it is worth the money. Problems are quickly resolved, they take care of their customers and they want their customers to be happy.Bravo to the team, see you soonJocelyn Pichette

<Content>Nice resort, so-so service, great beach. We stayed January 31 to the 7th of February.One of the reasons we chose this resort was based on the Trip advisor reviews. We thought we had a good deal on the vacation package through sunwing only to find out that the we flew into Santo Domingo, a 3.5 hour bus ride to the resort. We learned and saved the 75$ a person excursion to the city! All it means is that we spent 2 days of our 7 travelling.The resort is very nice, really geared to the wedding crowd. The beach is superb - way better than Puerto Plata - worth the extra money. We were two couples that went down and both booked the rooms that have pool access and Tub outside. Never used either. All the reviews were right that you should try to stay in row 3 or 4 to avoid the construction sounds.One of the things for us was the party, This resort caters to the relax-spa-lay back crowd. The animation team try hard but the overall atmosphere was low key. We were hoping for more fun and party time, but the resort just died down at night. The dico was lame. And other than sitting and playing cards in the lobby, there wasn't very much else to do.We were also dissapointed in the service, the steakhouse was the worst - the waiter asked if we all wanted the chateaubriand and then walked away, we had to call him back to tell him how we wanted it done and to ask for the appetizers. We tried the japanese, mexican and seafood restaurants. All were nothing to rave about and the main buffet was better. Pata station, omlet and crepe stations were the top choices.The beach was warm and the water in the pool fine also. I spent 3 days snorkeling and saw many fish right at the Majestic beach.I will return to Bavaro Beach but probably not to the Majestic, well maybe when I'm 70.

<Content>Fantastic Vacation I recently returned from vacationing at the Majestic Colonial ( January 31st- Feb 7th) and I was very impressed by this hotel. My husband and I travelled with another couple and we all enjoyed our stay. The rooms were very spacious and clean and the grounds were immaculate. Upon arrival at the hotel we were told that our room was in a different building than our friends. The following day, Victor at the front desk was able to accomodate a move for us which placed our room beside our friends. The pool was beautiful and because it extended the length of the property, it never felt crowded.  Although some reviews indicate the food is not the best, we really had no complaints. The fruit was amazing and there was always a wide variety of food choices. We celebrated a birthday at the Japanese restuarant and it was entertaining to watch our food being cooked at the table. Not only was it delicious but the the staff were very friendly and they surprised us with a birthday cake that was decadent.  We also enjoyed the animation staff and particularily our spanish lesson provided by Cesar by the pool. The beach was clean and there was always an abundance of beach chairs and adequate shade when needed.  I would definately vacation at the Majestic Colonial again and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to experience a comfortable, relaxing stay in the Domincan.J- Toronto , Canada

<Author>only_n_cali
<Content>Nice place...but please read I just got back from a four day stay at the Majestic Colonial. I read some of the reviews before I left and it's apparent that there's a little truth in a lot of the comments. I've stayed in everything from The Holiday Inn to The Four Seasons and all in between so I'm going to tell you how it is:THE GOOD:*The reception lobby area is open, airy and impressive, it looks just like it does in the pictures. (on par with a Hyatt Resort) *The staff are VERY nice and attentive. A few but most employees do not speak a lot of English, so it's good to know the basics. *The grounds are well manicured and kept clean. *The rooms are very decent (on the level of a Sheraton or Marriott). *Had a massage and it was great, slightly less expensive than an hour massage at a typical spa in LA. *Took the ATV tour - through the streets, stops at a nice beach and cave....awesome! (A must do)*Rented racing boats on the beach...pretty fun but be ready for a wild ride the waves are choppy at this beach.*Club Mangu...if you want to party definitely go here!THE BAD:*The food is very average but it's an all inclusive resort with buffets so what do you expect. The best food is in the restaurants that require reservations.*The rooms are designed for couples...bathrooms are open with no privacy.*I did see a couple of roaches in the room but my other friends did not have that experience in theirs (it's a tropical island so I ignored it unlike I would if I saw one in the states).*There was one ATM (issues pesos only) that was broken the entire time and the casino which gives US money opens after 4pm (minimum withdrawal is $100 with a $7 surcharge)BOTTOM LINEFor an all inclusive resort this place is really nice, and in spite of some of the problems, I would still recommend it. It is NOT the St Regis! If you want luxury, you need to stay at the SIVORY or PUNTACANA RESORT  CLUB. While there I visited the BARCELO BAVARO RESORT (a very low budget hotel), stay away from there! Absolutely no comparison to the Majestic. Overall I would recommend The Majestic as a very good choice for the money.

<Content>Cant Wait to Go Back!!! We just got back from the Majestic. It was wonderful. We stayed there for 5 nights and wish we could have stayed a lot longer. The beach is the best we have been to. The food was great. But it was the entertainment staff made it unforgetable. Rey and his group were so much fun. They would be at the pool everyday entertaining and having a great time. Then we would go to the shows and the disco at night and they were there doing it all. Such a wonderful group of guys to be around. If we knew the same guys would be there next time-we would not hesitate to go back to the same place. We did not bring our kids with us on this trip and wish we would have. There are fun things for all ages.

<Content>Majestic Colonial - BEAUTIFUL RESORT We stayed at the Majestic Colonial with 3 other couples Jan 20-25. It is a Beautiful Resort, the grounds (especially at night), service, pool, and food were just great !! I even gained 6lbs (diet time now). I loved the breakfast meal, we ate at the buffet for all our breakfast meals and for lunch we picked at the beach bar infront of the beach. One day they even had a raw oyster bar set up !!Dinners, we ate 2 nights at the steak house and once my husband even had 2 steak meals the same night.........he loved the steak and I had the chicken and it was delicious. The other dinners we ate at the buffet, because we loved being able to pick out what you wanted and the desserts, so many to pick from and all so good. In the morning I loved the smoothie's !! The beach and ocean is just breath taking. We stayed in building 4 and had the Ocean Front room. Hard to beat that again !! The towel thing that people complain about, I just brought one towel from my room.......just make sure you bring it back. Hey come on you have to be accountable for some things.The building 4 is overlooking the construction going on and I would not have liked staying in those rooms with the view of the construction, but that is me. Soon that construction thing should be completed. The rooms are beautiful with marble foors and the big tub inside the room is soooooo nice, we only used the tub once but enjoyed - you never run out of hot water.The beds were not hard as some say in other post....I actually had to set my alarm a couple time to get up to get pictures of the sunrise, othewise I would have slept till 8pm!!Would I return to this resort? Yes, but we like to try a new place each year, so onto another island !! May return someday.Enjoy your stay at the Majestic - it's a beautiful resort !!

<Content>Had a Fantastic Time at the Majestic Colonial My husband and I along with another couple stayed at this resort from January 25th to February 8th. Yes......two weeks. Before we left, we had read nasty reviews of the resort and were starting to get a bit nervous. We are all angry that we allowed these reviews to cause us stress before we even left for the vacation. The resort is absolutely beautiful. Our room was not a special room. It faced the the back garden........but we loved it. The rooms are very spacious and the cherry wood was beautiful. The showers were huge and the water pressure was wonderful. Yes, there may be a musty smell at times.....but you are in a very humid country. We found the rooms to be very quiet. Our power went out on occasion but I made a phone call and someone knocked on the door while I was still on the phone.......now that's service!! It was fixed within seconds. When I heard the reviews about how unfriendly the staff were.....I was outraged. These people who complain about the staff....I have a question for you. Have you ever tried to talk to them in Spanish? You are in THEIR country after all. Have you ever shown kindness instead of expectations? They don't owe you anything. We found everyone we met to be very friendly and willing to make your day better. The staff will treat you with the respect that you give them in return. We found the food to be excellent. There were so many choices at the buffet. The menu restaurants were also great. Out of five choices of restaurants you only had to make reservations for two of them. We were all healthy except for the occasional night which we blame the fact we had too many bahama mamas....or pina coladas. Guess what........coconut milk is a laxative. Who knew?? The pool is amazing. It is kept very clean and winds around through the entire resort. We loved to stay on the beach but on the occasional day when the wind was strong, we stayed by the pool. The beach was beautiful. The water is clear and blue. The sand is soft and is raked everyday by the staff. At times the waves were rougher than usual which only caused a great deal of fun trying to body surf. The day we left for home was a sad day. The man who dropped off our water and soft drinks everyday stopped by to say good-bye. He thanked us for coming and hugged us goodbye. Our maid called out to us and also hugged us good-bye. We met many people at the resort who loved staying there and had no complaints. So to the people who are planning on going to this resort and are going there with a kind and open heart. Relax. You will love it. Our group would go back there in a heartbeat. Here's to booking our next year's trip!!

<Content>Great Place, Great People My mom and I just returned from a 5 day trip to Punta Cana. We flew into the Punta Cana airport and stayed at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana. What a relaxing and entertaining vacation! It was just what we needed in the middle of the winter. There was never a dull moment at the Majestic. The entertainment staff was EXCELLENT! They were so much fun and always trying to engage the guests in games or dancing or aerobics or whatever was planned for the day. They were always around to provide some fun, whether at the beach, at the pool, at one of the many bars, or at the theatre at night. I was so impressed because the anamation staff did every activity in Spanish, English and French. You don't have to worry if you don't speak spanish because more than likely someone will speak your language. Sandy, one of the anamation staff, was even around at the piano bar to greet guests to make sure they were having a good time. I can't say enough good things about how nice and friendly everyone was who worked at this hotel (as well as the others who were vactioning there). My favorite person was DENNY from the beach. He serves drinks on the beach and was so nice. He would bring me and my mom drinks of all different varieties. When we didn't know what we wanted he would surprise us with different drinks. He was always around to check on us.The food was good. There were alway so many choices. Whatever you like they had it. Most of the meals are buffet style but there are always chefs cooking a variety of different foods. There are a couple of restaurants that you can sit down at and order food, but only for dinner. I highly recommend the Rodeo grill - the steak is excellent!The only downfall is the musty smell in the rooms. I didn't mind too much because I spent minimal time there but it could be a problem for someone who was planning on spending more time there.I would definitely go back! The beach and the weather was fabulous. A great retreat from the cold!

<Content>Overall, a nice resort My wife and I just returned from our stay at the Majestic. We were there from Feb. 7th - 11th. Since I booked this trip six months ago I had a lot of time to read the reviews on Trip Advisor. Like others before me mentioned, the reviews at either end of the spectrum (i.e., worst resort ever or the best resort in the world) should be taken with a grain of salt. Clearly the Majestic is a nice place and probably one of the best in Punta Cana. But it also has its flaws and is definitely NOT the 5 star resort it's oftentime advertised as. Arrival - Our flight arrived in the late afternoon on a Thursday. Many reviews have stressed the importance of not taking pre-arranged shuttles from the airport. I booked mine way in advance and really didn't feel like making changes so we took the shuttle. We had no problems. No waiting in long lines at the airport or anything like that. The van was very comfortable. There were only 6 of us with 4 going to the Majestic and 2 going to the RIU Palace (two resorts down the beach) so it wasn't as if we were making a ton of stops. I'm pretty sure the transfer would have been worse had we arrived on a Friday or Saturday. I'd keep that in mind when booking. Check-In - Again, this seemed to be a major complaint by many of the negative reviewers. We were fortunate to arrive in the late afternoon so the lobby was nearly deserted of new arrivals. We were greeted by the famous Victor who was as advertised - very accommodating and professional. He not only checked us in but escorted us to the dinner reservations desk and walked us through making reservations for the week. He then accompanied us all the way to our room which was at the other end of the resort nearest the beach - probably a 10 minute walk. He explained the room's amenities and what was included in our package and explained the layout of the resort. It was all very professional and much appreciated. I'm not sure why we received the royal treatment by the manger (or one of the managers) of the resort. All of the arriving guests I saw had to find their rooms on their own. I think the service we received was due to a) the lack of guests checking in at the time we arrived and b) the fact that I called the resort 4 times in the previous month to confirm my reservation and also emailed them the week prior (as others have recommended). Check-in could not have gone better.Room - We had an ocean view suite in building 2 - room 2154. The room was very nice and well situated. No foul odor or exposed wires as reported by other reviewers. I would recommend for those staying in an ocean front suite to request a room on the second or third floor for optimum ocean views. We were on the ground floor and could see the ocean ok, but the second floor would have been nicer. One tip: Confirm on arrival what plan you have. I wasn't aware that I had purchased the 'Supreme Package' which gave us free room service (not included in the standard all-inclusive) and premium alcohol. No complaints about the room. Grounds - The resort's grounds are immaculate. There is no doubt that the grounds crew does a wonderful job maintaining a beautiful landscape. Pool- Even the most negative reviews gushed about the pool and rightly so. The pool is the best I've been in. It meanders through the center of resort, around various bars, the spa, and restuarants. I felt that best thing about the pool was that the areas in which to lounge in were spread out in pockets. It's wasn't as if you looked up the pool and saw chairs lining it all the way to the beach. This design eliminated the feeling of being in a crowded resort pool. And, aside from the wet bar area, the pool areas were fairly quiet. Beach - The beach was nice. It's a half moon shaped beach (jutting into the ocean) and always felt uncrowded. My wife and I took a long walk down the beach and felt that the Majestic's was the nicest out of the any of the resorts around it. We never had any problem finding beach chairs. I much prefer a beach on the Caribbean Sea, however. The Atlantic coastline was fairly rough even though our beach was guarded by a reef 200 yards away from the shoreline. The water was warm and clear.Entertainment - The entertainment was surprisingly good. I'm using the first one to want to leave a resort show, but the shows involving the local dance troupe (The Stars are Here and the Michael Jackson show) were really good. Food/Drink - Ok, here's where I start siding with the negative reviews. My wife and I put a lot of emphasis on the importance of the quality of food in whatever resort or hotel in which we're staying. I can honestly say that this is my first vacation EVER that I didn't enjoy one good meal. Most of the food was really bland and fairly tasteless. Even the reservation-only restaurants - Le Gourmet and Taino (Japanese) - produced really bland food. I never expected the low quality of the food, even after reading all the bad reviews. I was really shocked and disappointed. The Supreme buffet was, unfortunately, the best option for food there. The drinks were ok. It seemed they got worse the farther away from the lobby you went. The bars in and around the lobby produced really good drinks. Oh, and expect the worst wine you've ever had. Seriously - it was like drinking blueberry schnapps. The wet bar and beach bar were just ok. If you're the type of person that just wants to go and enjoy the fun and sun and food is secondary, don't worry about the food. It's not really terrible or anything. It's just not as good as we would have wanted.People - The cool thing about this resort is that it is very diverse. In fact, I would say that Americans were in the minority - there were a ton of Europeans (especially Spanish) and Canadians. It was nice to meet people from all over the world and not feel like the resort was dominated by Americans. But, as luck would have it, I was again embarrassed by a few of my countrymen (I stress a FEW - most were great). Why is it that drunk and obnoxious Americans need to always make a scene? Most everyone there was nice and quiet and kept to themselves except for those two or three groups of Americans who had to direct attention to themselves while drinking their 40-oz insulated mugs full of Presidente (which I found ironic considering how quickly they were consumed). I'm not trying to tell anyone to not have fun - my wife and I are under 30 and drank all week - but seriously, what is the need for the constant attention-seeking commotion? What's wrong with having a good time without reinforcing the stereotype of the Tommy Boy-esque American? Aside from some slight annoyances, we had a good time. I'd highly recommend that you arrive and leave mid-week to avoid much of the frustration of dealing with the crowds on Friday and Saturday. I'd also recommend contacting the resort a couple times prior to your stay to confirm that the arrangements are in order. I'm not sure if I'd return to the Majestic or go to another all-inclusive resort in the DR. With that said, I'm not so sure there's anything much better in the DR. Punta Cana as a destination is so new (relatively) and I don't think they have the infrastructure yet to manage really top-quality resorts. Hopefully I'm wrong and will visit again....

<Content>In serious withdrawal This was exactly the relaxing vacation my discerning 70 yr old mother and I had been hoping for. A hotel and room that were incredibly clean and impressive, and staff that were more than friendly and respectful. Food that was fantastic representing many different cultures including familiar preparations. A grilling station with lobster, tuna, shrimp, mahi mahi, and meats on various nights with many fantastic vegetable dishes sampled for the first time. Breadfruit, plantain, chayote, cassava, guava - too many dishes to mention. Croissants filled with dark chocolate dipped in white chocolate to accompany my morning latte and the most outstanding fresh pumpernickel bread I have ever devoured. I'm not even fond of pumpernickel bread. Quando, quando, quando still echoes in my mind as we sipped cocktails to the outdoor entertainment as does Billy Jean from the Sunday night show. And I'm not even fond of latter performer's music : ) The most notable were all the fantastic people that we met. Fellow Punta Canadians, Italians, Americans, French, Flemish, Spanish, Germans, not to mention the well behaved children and infants travelling with them. The 19 yr old vendor in the middle of the Punta Blanca Market outside the resort who we had immense pleasure bartering with. The coolness of the pool allowed us to tolerate the unforgiving heat and we enjoyed meandering through the length of it stopping to chat with vacationers along the way. Salty peanuts tempered sweet Pina Coladas and Majestics courtesy of the pool bar.Did everything mentioned above make our stay? I would have to venture that we made our own stay and wouldn't change a thing.All this while traveling with a 5 month old.

<Content>Don't Believe It Don't believe the negative reviews. We just got back from a week-long stay 2/2-2/9/08. The place is beautiful, the food is excellent, and the service is very good, except the girls in the casino had a bit of an attitude. Not all the staff can understand English but why should they? The language of the Dominican Republic is Spanish. Besides, there are tourists from all over the world at this resort. Should the staff speak 10 different languages? We expect anyone in the United State s to speak English. I won't bore you with all the details of our trip, but in summary the resort is well worth the money.

<Content>loved the grounds of the Majestic We were at the Majestic Colonial for a two week vacation. The grounds were absolutely stunning. We loved the selection of restaurants and bars. The food was plentiful and a wide range of food options. The pool went on forever. The staff people were very attentive to our every need and were polite and professional and tried to understand our needs. We do not speak spanish so it wasn't always easy. We were extremely impressed with Denny the beach concierge. He was very polite and attentive to our every request. It was a beautiful vacation and very hard to come back home to zero degree weather. We are ready to return tomorrow.

<Content>Majestic "DO NOT GO" I will get right to the point. For what you will spend at this resort, do not go. It is not at all worth it. The staff is the rudest I have ever experienced. The staff thinks people do not study their language and will put all foreign people down, thinking nobody understands them. They overbook their hotel, so if you book a room upgrade forget about getting it. The staff would rather clean ashtrays then help you. The maids never clean the rooms, the surrounding area is a garbage dump, flies everywhere. The only nice thing to say is the beach. But you can get that anywhere in Mexico and also be treated with respect. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN A PLACE THEY DO NOT RESPECT YOU!!!!!

<Content>"Okay" time at the Majestic. Wouldn't go back. Let me start off with a tip that I wish someone would have told us before we left. *Bring a big Travel Mug with you. The cups are small at the resort so if you want a big cup of coffee or a big 'Pina Colada' or beer to walk around with-bring a travel mug with you. We booked our trip because the Majestic was rated #1 on TripAdvisor. It's now slipped to #2. We had better service at a 3star resort in La Romana than we did here. Let me say the positives: Richard at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. I contacted him before we left as I did not want a room facing the construction. He took care of us and we got a beautiful room. We had a Colonial Junior Suite and it was lovely. There was a huge terrace overlooking the ocean..beautiful. The housekeeping staff was very friendly and kind. We had Rum, Wine, Champagne, Whiskey, Pepsi, Chocolate, Water, Coffee and Espresso in the room. Aside from the chocolate, it was re-stocked every day. The walk in shower is really nice and had lots of hot water and pressure. There was a really comfy Terry robe to use- I loved it.There is an iron  ironing board in the room- ours didn't work very well but we didn't need it much anyhow.The pool is outstanding however it was too cold to swim around in when we were there. There are plenty of chairs but you have to play the towel game if you want to get one. It really isn't fair to put your towel on a chair at 8am so it can be yours at 2pm. It's a little annoying-wish that could change but....Never a problem getting a drink. The main drinks are from 'Slushy' machines. The Main Buffet had lots to choose from. We enjoyed the seafood restaurant. We had the lobster twice- very yummy.The gym was adequate. It smelled pretty musty and could use a good cleaning. It had free weights, treadmills, some machines and benches. You could certainly get a good workout there. It was air conditioned and music was always playing. At the piano bar, a young gentleman played the piano every night. It was very nice to sit and listen to him while having a coffee or drink. The shows were pretty corny but that is personal opinion. You may like them. We avoided the Disco as it was too smoky. It would have been nice if the resort had a beach party one night or had some night time activities/games. We did have bugs in our room. Lots of ants and a few mosquitoes. I'm still scratching at the bug bites on my legs. I'd wake up each night with a few new ones.The service staff at the buffet needs some training. We are not demanding people but a smile would be nice. There is a language barrier. If you don't speak spanish, learn a few key phrases before you go. Basically---if you want good service, you have to tip (at least that is how it was for us). It seemed the more you tipped, the nicer they were to you. At the last resort we stayed in, there was a no tipping policy and everyone got great service, every day, from every one. (we should have went back there).Now-I'm not saying we got bad service from everyone. There were some ones. I'd say it was about 50/50. The seafood restaurant had good service every time.We were told not to go to the Steak House as the meat was tough and food bad. We avoided it.Now...here's the bad stuff:I got very very sick after eating at the so called Gourmet restaurant. The next morning was the worst I have felt in my life. I spent the day in the room as I didn't want to travel to far from the 'washroom'. It took 5 days to get back to myself. It was not pleasant. Others got sick as well (see past reviews). There are cockroaches. We had a laugh at a bunch of them that were swarming (a nest maybe?) in a wicker table across from the piano bar. When you put a warm drink on the glass, they would emerge (under the glass). We pointed it out to the waitress who got startled at the sight of them. I hope they take care of the problem before you get there.They had men wearing masks spraying chemicals on the plants in mid day. The problem is that they had masks and we did not. It's not pleasant to get a whiff of that stuff when you walk by.Be prepared to get grabbed and hassled when they have the 'Market'. If you want to buy a souvenier, you will be hounded. A man wanted us to pay $130 American for a little blue necklace. I laughed out loud actually. We refused but he wouldn't let us walk away. Haggling went on for about 10 mins. Well guess how much we got it for?? $10. As soon as we left that vendor, there are 10 more grabbing at your arms to pull you to their tables... Cheapie Cheapie they kept saying. $80 for a shell necklace...On and ON and On.....It's hard to walk through. Take note of that... a so-called $130 necklace..we got for $10. (just for your reference)We tried calling the front desk a few times. Again, there is a language barrier here. We were patched to different people 5 or 6 times....disconnected once. It was a little much. One night at 2:30 in the morning, we were woken up with a phone call telling us to calm down the party in our room. (we were asleep--it wasn't us...but thanks a lot for waking us up!) You would think they would have an employee down to verify what room is causing a commotion and maybe knock on their door.The walls are very thin. You can hear everything out in the hall. Hard to sleep some nights.Breakfast starts at 7, Lunch at 12:30 and Supper at 6:30. It would be better if supper could start at 5:30 for us early risers. The snack bar that you can eat at between lunch and supper really needs help. Hamburgers/Hot dogs  Pizza. (lots of flies on them and it didn't look to appetizing). Add some fresh fruit, various rolls and veggies, maybe some nachos or something and it would be satisfying. It was really lacking in the snacks department.Our travel to  from the resort was fine. We checked out with no problems. We had an 'Okay' time. Really don't feel that it was worth the money we spent when we compare it to our other vacations. We wouldn't go back nor recommend it to our friends.I really hope that your experience is a good one and that you have have a better time than we did.Happy Travels to you!

<Content>Got what we needed We just returned from a 6 day 5 night trip to Punta Cana. The Majestic Colonial was more beautiful than anticipated. We had just come off of a very difficult year and needed time to recharge. A co-worker suggested the Majestic from the trip that he took last year. Not being sure that he and I would be interested in the same ammenities I also asked the advice of a travel agent. She had nothing but wonderful things to say about this resort so I continued my investigating. We found the best deal through cheap caribean and booked immediately.Walkig into the lobby you are immediately greeted with a cool towel and drink. The relaxing begins. We arrived a little early to check into the room but, they took our luggage, did the paperwork, gave us our bracelets and said to take a quick tour, get a bite to eat and our room would be ready shortly. It was. The pool was just spectacular. Not only was it nice to look at, there was never as much as a piece of sand in it. Considering that the pool begins maybe 100 feet from the beach this was amazing. There were always lounge chairs available and the pool area is so large that even though the hotel was filled to capacity you never felt over crowded. The beach left us speachless. The beauty and cleanliness made it picture perfect. Got pushed around a bit with the strong undertow, but being from NY we could more than handle it. Our room was nice. Very spacious We were on the second floor overlooking the pool in room 3205. Great location. Of course it was a little musty smelling but nothing too bad. We heard ahead of time that this might be and we were ready with a candle. We never even needed to light it, but we did open the jar. This just freshened it up a little. After each flush of the toilet there was a weird sound. We found out that it was due to air in the pipes. Nothing was ever done about this nor am I sure anything could have been done. The drinks were abundent. My husband never has to wait very long before someone put another beer in his hand. The people who worked here could not have been more professional or friendly. Nothing was ever a problem, they may not have been able to help you but they always did it with a smile and you always felt as though they really wanted to help. One of the negatives in my opinion was the buffet. I didn't care for the dinner buffet or the lunch buffet at the main buffet dinning area..There was a lot to choose from but my husband and I didn't think the quality was so good. But on the other hand you would never go hungry. All of the ala carte restaurants were great. My favorite was the japanese but my husband loved the steak restaurant. He loved his dinner and mine so the server brought him over another helping of what I was eating so he wouldn't eat mine. We had trouble with an excursion that we booked through cheap caribean because even though it was supposed to be just 15-20 minutes away from the hotel noone at the Majestic new anything about it and were not very helpful to us in trying to figure out what to do. In the end a bellboy put us in a taxi, told us we may not be able to get a taxi back and that we should pay the driver 80 US dollars to sit and wait for us. We did decide to do this but, after driving around Punta Cana for an hour and a half, we told the taxi driver in our most simple but demanding spanish that we could muster up to take us back to the Majestic. I must say I did not feel safe while driving outside of the resort. So I would suggest if you are thinking of booking an excursion do it through the hotel not a travel agent or a.com because representatives from the hotel are not able to help you if there is a problem. There are always activities going on at the pool and at the beach. You can join in or not, there is no pressure at all. As a matter of fact, the pool is soooo large that you may not even know that anything is going on down by the other end. The shows at night were OK, not good not bad, just OK. Something to do at 10:00 if you couldn't eat or drink another thing. Water sports were right there on the beach. We went tandum para sailing and saw the most spectacular views. I am 48 years old and not adventurous, but I am very happy I did it. My husband played in a golf tournament next door at the Punta Cana Golf resort. He was put in a foursome of other guests of the Majestic and he enjoyed that day as well. We went on this vacation to sit, relax and read a book without interuptions and thats exactly what we got. If you choose this resort you will be happy with the beauty of the buildings, the amazing pool and the most stunning beach. I can't image ever getting nicer landscape anywhere. Not only would I recommend this resort I would go back myself.

<Content>Great Service We just returned from a week with another couple at this fabulous resort. We'd highly recommend it. Great service. Great food. Great beach(although it is not Carribean water, it is Atlantic), great big pool, plenty of restaurants. You can relax or walk the beach which goes for miles. A great all-around place.

<Author>MelbaLalala
<Content>Pretty good resort! Just got back from the Majestic Colonial. My husband and I had a fabulous time. This is our fourth all-inclusive resort, second in Punta Cana. We have been to Palladium Punta Cana (Royal Suites), Palladium Riviera Maya (Royal Suites), and Excellence Riviera Maya, if that helps you put it into perspective.I鈥檒l spare the usual details: how we were greeted, the grounds were gorgeous, etc. and break it down to what we loved and what needed improvement.My criticisms tend to be long and perhaps harsh, but it really does not reflect how much we enjoyed this resort. It was a GREAT trip, I鈥檓 just trying to be as helpful as possible to future travelers. I know I tend to look at the negative things people say about resorts more than the positive. (how鈥檚 THAT for glass half-empty?) None of the negative things I say 鈥渞uined鈥?our trip. It鈥檚 more of a 鈥渉ow I would change the resort if I was management鈥?What we loved:-The A/C in the room was the best out of all AIs we鈥檝e been to. In the past, the room never felt cold, just felt damp and cool. The A/C at Majestic Colonial was GREAT.-Housekeeping. We never saw them, and our room was always clean when we got back to it. What more could you want?-The restaurants. We ate at Le Gourmet twice, the steak restaurant twice, and the Mexican/Caribbean restaurant once. All were fantastic. The fact that they had the seafood/steak restaurants beachfront was really great and romantic.-The staff. So sweet and friendly. The check-in staff was fantastic. The bellboys so nice. Most of the bartenders, fun and courteous. Wait staff, professional and kind.-The size of this resort was absolutely PERFECT. Everything was close, but not too close. We鈥檝e stayed at some HUGE places that took 25 minutes to walk to the nicer beaches and really enjoyed the fact that the walk time between the beach and the lobby was about 10. The layout was great too!What needed improvement:-The buffet. While the food wasn鈥檛 terrible, we were completely flabbergasted as to why NOTHING was labeled at the buffet. This is a first for us at any resort. There were many options that looked good but no one knew what they were so they were avoiding them. When you have a resort that caters to clientel from all over, you really need to label food at a buffet.-Public restrooms. These really got to the point where they were embarrassing for the caliber of resort MC is trying to be. There was something missing/lacking in each public restroom. For example, the one by the beach had a toilet seat missing, one soap dispenser for 4 sinks, and no paper towel holder. The papertowels are left on the sink ledge in a roll and got soggy and gross. The bathroom by the casino/sports bar had no soap dispenser and relied on tiny bars of soap which is a little gross. In addition, there isn鈥檛 enough public bathrooms. Around the pool/beach area, there are two sets. This isn鈥檛 enough as the pool is HUGE, so depending on where you were you could have to walk a good 5 minutes to get to one. Might be a reason why none of the people at the swim-up bar were never getting out of the pool despite the gallons of beer they were drinking. ;-) I will say the restrooms were very clean though!-The allocation of staff members. There always seemed to be either too many or too little staff in every situation. At the steak restaurant, for example, you were BOMBARDED with people asking you how things were going, how your meal was, etc. (*almost* to the point where it was too much). BUT, then at the buffet you had to beg someone for a glass of water. The bars never had enough bartenders working at them (with the exception of the swim-up bar). At night, everyone loves to sit out in the plaza and listen to music, yet that bar only has one bartender. Everyone then shifts to the theater, again one bartender.-The Sports Bar. At all of the resorts we鈥檝e been to, we love to spend some of the night sipping drinks at the sports bar, watching a little ESPN to catch up with the sports world and relax. The Sports Bar at MC had a strange setup (you couldn鈥檛 see the TVs from the bar) and the bartender there was rarely to be found earlier in the night. He was usually sitting in one of the couch areas watching a game. The TVs there all had an orange picture too.Tiny little things that belong in the 鈥渄idn鈥檛 ruin our trip but we noticed them鈥?-Only one towel hut was open and was inconvenient for where we were located.-Why is the plaza area (with the live nighttime music) so dark? Excellence Riviera Maya had a similar area that we enjoyed but had a lot more lighting. At MC, it was so dark I found myself wanting to pass out from sleepiness.-The best Majestic drink I had was when we first checked in, none of the other ones I had the rest of the trip even came close and were always a little off.-The bedding was pretty cheap and old-looking. The blankets look like they might have been bought from an old Motel 6 that closed and the sheets were very thin. They were clean though, which is very important to me and the beds were VERY comfortable.-They really need to invest in a new CD for the resort soundtrack. If we heard the pan-flute version of Hotel California one more time I think we would have cried -The music in the disco is ridiculously loud.

<Content>Drink bottled water and watch the ice cubes otherwise great hotel! Just got back from group trip with 7 others., we had a great time!! The resort was beautiful, the rooms were gorgeous, pool was awesome and the staff was great. The only thing is we ALL came down with Montezuma's revenge. We were all cautious to not drink the tap water, however, during lunch and dinner we would request water and god knows if it was filtered or tap. If it was filtered, they really need to upgrade and do a better job at insuring the quality of the water when serving it to people. They do offer bottled water - we should have stuck with that.But who knows what they were serving us in our mix drinks. I have been to Mexico before and the resort we stayed at (Iberostar) made sure the water we were served during dinner, ice in the drinks..etc, were all through their filtered system. And because of that, we never had a problem.The only other thing I did not like was the quality of the alcohol was watered down and they served you the drinks in plastic disposable cups. We understand the plastic part, but both Jamaica and Mexico served you tall plastic glasses. This is such a minor detail and one that would not make or break our next trip. As for the food, I would give it about a 6. The gourmet restaurant was great, Chinese  Japanese was pretty good as well, but overall the buffets we alright. There was plenty to choose from and safe foods we stuck with like pizza, pasta, rice beans鈥tc.  Other than that, I would recommend this resort but I would strongly urge people to avoid the water at the tables, avoid fruits and vegetables that are not steamed (i.e. salad) because they rinse them in the tap water, and limited the number of mixed drinks because who knows if they use the tap water for ice.We booked with our travel agent Betsy at Yogatta Travel and she was very helpful, you can find her information online.

<Content>Great Stay at the Majestic I have never posted a review before, but I felt I needed to after our recent stay and other comments I have read.Let me start by saying that I truly believe that some people are not happy unless they are unhappy. I had been reading the recent negative reviews of the Majestic before my trip and I was more than a bit nervous about how things would be when I got there. After spending a week there (1/26 - 2/2) with my wife and two other couples, we were all thrilled with the way the vacation turned out. This way, by far, the best value we have received for our vacation when comparing with Riviera Maya, cruises, and US vacation destinations. No, everything was not perfect, but overall it is a very nice place to spend a week's vacation!Check-inTransfers from the airport were no problem. It is apparent on the way to the hotel that this is a poor area. The rest of the infrastructure apart from the hotel zones hasn't caught up yet. There were a lot of partially built roads and buildings along the way. Check-in was quick, probably about 15 minutes for our group. I had requested rooms in bldg. 2 and that is what we got. RoomsThe rooms were very large and finished nicely with marble. Upon close inspection, it is obvious that the workmanship in the D.R. isn't up to the same level that you would see in other countries but it didn't detract from the overall feel. Everything in the room (TV, safe, air cond., etc) worked well. One funny thing is that the clocks in ours and our friend's rooms all ran fast. From the first day to the last, the clocks would gain about a half hour. The rooms did smell a bit musty but that, I'm sure is due to the very humid conditions. It was also something I didn't even notice after the first day or two. Maid service was good; she always left fresh flowers and brought a clean set of towels in the evening along with a turndown. Definitely ask for a room in bldgs. 2 or 3 as those rooms will look over the pool area rather than neighboring resorts. FoodThe food was good overall, especially for an all-inclusive resort trying to please people from all over the world. We ate at all of the restaurants and the buffets and always found things that we liked. Especially good were the gourmet restaurant and the breakfast buffet. I felt the presentation of the food was always sanitary; the cold items typically sat on a refrigerated surface and the hot items were kept warm. There were definitely some things there that didn't look too good to me, but I'm sure they were just fine to others. The service ranged from pretty good (they would sometimes forget to refill water or be a little slow) to outstanding (very helpful in accomodating special requests) and they were always friendly. GroundsThe grounds were spectacular. The pool area was clean, water was perfect. People have mentioned that the pool was cold. I would call it refreshing but certainly not cold. Plenty of chairs. People would play the save-a-chair game but you would never have a problem getting a chair either at the pool or at the beach. The beach was beautiful with clean sand beaches as far as you could see. We walked to the vendor market about 2 miles down the beach and I think the Majestic had the best overall beach and location. The water was not too cold and there was always a relaxing surf rolling in. I did notice that it was a bit windy at the beach and I never saw anyone that was able to use the non-motorized watersports equipment. Seemed that they always said it was too windy for it.SpaThe spa looked nice and the services were good, however only one of two hot tubs (more like a warm tub with a gigantic jet on the bottom) were working. The steam rooms also weren't working. The massage services were good and were priced as you would expect at a resort.One final note is that there is definitely a language barrier. However, we were almost always able to get our point or question across and it never created any issues, instead we had fun with it. I heard a few workers helpfully letting guests know how to say things in Spanish (two eggs = dos huevos). But at least a couple times I saw somebody who arrogantly told the cook I didn't come here to learn a new language! or just ignore them altogether. It only takes a few bad apples to ruin it for everyone. We would probably want them to speak our language in our country too wouldn't we?If you are looking to spend a relaxing time at a very nice place at a great price, I would definitely recommed the Majestic.

<Content>Not very Majestic! Our Punta Cana vacation began with a nice landing at a beautiful airport! The drive to the hotel was about 25 mins, but it was not a scenic drive at all.All of the roads were broken down, and some new roads were under construction but you can tell that construction was at a halt, so who knows when they finish building some decent roads.Once there, the entrance to the hotel was not spectacular but the lobby was nice! We were immediately greeted with a tropical drink that was delicious! Check in took too long! We were there for about 30 mins and there was only one person in front of us.The vacation began with the wrong room. I paid for the Colonial Jr. Suite, and we got was a standard Jr. Suite (which doesn't come with room service). I made this aware to one of the managers and they told me that they had overbooked the hoteland they had nothing else available. I was offered free internet and a 25 min. massage, which was nice, but it didn't make up for the room. Anyways, we decided to put this aside and enjoy the vacation, and we did!The beach location is great! Very nice beach chairs!The hotel has 7 restaurants but only 2 were great, the Japanese and Chinese! The other ones were ok - a bit tasteless, not enough seasoning, and their desserts tasted like they were sugar-free. I wouldn't eat from the restaurant by the beach!It was completely open (which was nice) but there were flies all over the food, and there was no way to control it... very disgusting!The room was nice, not spectacular, but nice. I have stayed in 5 star hotels before and the Majestic wasn't up to par, as far as the look of their buildings. Many had concrete cracks, and they didn't pay much detail to construction, like the bathrooms, you could see a bad tile job. In the shower we couldn't control the hot/cold water... it was either too hot or cold. The free internet that we were offered was a pain! Each day they made me go to the lobby for a new username andpassword...which was very far from our room. After getting the internet info, it wouldn't work... so I would have to get on the phone with tech support each time.The entertainment was horrible. They had some guys do some corny games... Not professional entertainment at all... not even close to what you see at a cruise ship!The pool was very nice!It was our anniversary... I asked them to do something special in our room that they... they said that they will fill up the tub with bubbles and rose pedals, but that I would have to buy the pedals...In conclusion the hotel was nice, but I was expecting so much more.

<Content>Not "Majestic" At All We have deicided to go based on all those positive reviews.We have also lower our expectations too. This is NOT FIVE STAR (maybe 2 star) resort.SERVICE AND FOOD JUST TERRIBLE. Beach is the best part and their bell service. Food first night @ Seafood restaurant was joke,bad caffeteria taste.Rodeo grill same thing. During day @ Hispanola restaurant (same location just different name) food sitting without refrigaration with flys all over. French and Japanese were joke too,shouldn't be allowed to used those titles (french and japanese) Only decent place for food is supreme buffet with much better service. we stayed for 4 nights and then moved to another DLUXE PLUS OR 5 STAR/6APPLES joke resort Dreams.That was even worse. Punta Cana was FIRST,LAST AND NEVER AGAIN .Witnessed confrotation at front desk ,angry guests whose documents and money were stolen from those safe deposit boxes.Hotel only 3 years old looked so weared down, Some people do have fun there so you would be the best judge.Do not ake our mistake and fall FOR #1 RATED RESORT @at the time of our booking. I can not imagine what feels like to stay at resort # 48good luck

<Content>Staff!! Would just like to pass along a review on how great the staff was @ the resort!! I visited the resort from January 19th- January 26th 2008 was down there with a group for a wedding!! Was one of the many crazy Canadians enjoying the warm weather!! All the staff was wonderful but there were a few that I like to mention that were outstanding!!! Amourie and Frances who both worked at the lobby bar made awesome drinks and were very entertaining!!. We also were entertained each afternoon and evening by the entertainment staff who was great involving the crowd!! The whole group was awesome but a couple of guys were fablous.....our favourites were Samuel and Jimmie!! Jimmie had us in stiches every day because he was so funny and Samuel was our fitness instructor who taught the aqua fit classes and step!! I took part in the aqua classes but not the step...just recovering from a leg inquiry so the water helped...a nice way to start the day!! All and all the staff was a huge part that made my trip as enjoyable as it was!!! And yes we did love the Tackie Tackie dance!!!! You will not be disappointed with the staff at the resort!! everyone was great!! Looking forward to my next visit to Majestic and to the Dominican!!!!!

<Content>Really fantastic! This was my first trip to Punta Cana. I went with two friends and we shared a room. I read every single review on trip advisor and there were some scary ones right before we left (after we had already booked) but we figure some people are impossible to please so we would go in with a great attitude.I emailed early and communicated with Rafael - who promised we could get a room in building 2. I do suggest getting a room in bldg 2 or 3 as they have the best views.When we got to the hotel we were greeted with cold wash cloths to wipe our faces. It was really lovely. Then while we were checking in they offered us the Majestic which is their house frozen drink - we loved it and drank them all weekend.At first they were not able to get us into the right building but when I mentioned I had been working with Rafael they confirmed with him and while we had to wait about an hour, they were able to get us in bldg 2. The wait was fine, we just went to grab food.The rooms were really large and nice -we were on the 4th floor and the that was wonderful. We had a beautiful view of the pool. When we got to our room they were still cleaning it and we saw that they moved the beds to clean under them and it looked like they did a really great job. We had no problems with the open air bathrooms honestly, it is not really open and not an issue at all.The pools are beautiful!! There is a nice quite side and if you are in the mood for entertainment and activities you can stay on that side of the pool as well.The bars are nice and everyone on staff was extremely friendly.Regarding food - it was not out of this world but it was not terrible either (not in any way). We ate at the steak house the first night after reading several reviews that it was the best of all options. We were not impressed at all and in fact I would say it was the worst of all options. The buffet was actually quite nice. There were a lot of choices and the food was truly pretty good. The breakfasts were amazing and I long for them now that I am home!I think we liked Le Gourmet the best. The service and food were outstanding. We would have eaten there every night if we had not waited until the last night to try it. I would have liked to try the Matusn as well (the reservations only side) but we did not get a chance.The spa was quite nice as well and we enjoyed the beach but spent most of our time at the pool as it was more our speed.We really loved this trip. I think all of us would go back again and again. I am an event and wedding planner - I have stayed at a lot of hotels all over the world and honestly, I really loved this trip!There were a few things not wonderful (but not terrible either). 1.) I did get some bug bites. I think they were sand fleas but I was the only one out of all three of us to get bites and I put some meds on them and it was fine. 2.) the bathtub would not drain at all. It was not a problem until the last day so we did not worry about it but I am sure they would have come to fix it if I had asked. 3.) I made coffee in the room and the dirty cup was not removed. Again, not wonderful but not the end of the world.I say book it and have a wonderful time!!Oh and I LOVED the airport - it is totally open air and it was exactly what I wanted when I arrived from the snowy midwest! I also loved being out in the beautiful sunlight until the very last moment when we walked onto the plane ... That was perfect!

<Content>Love Majestic I have been to the Dominican Republic 4 times and have stayed at 3 different resorts. My family and I have stayed at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana twice, once was during the summer of 2007 and then again in December of 2007. Majestic Colonial was by far the best resort! The beach, the food, the general atmosphere was wonderful! The rooms are spacious and I found the service to be wonderful!One of the main reason that my family and I enjoyed the resort was because of the Entertainment team. They were just so pleasant and friendly -- always willing to teach you to salsa or bachata -- for example Kiko, Pablo, Melvin  Sandy!! One of the best parts of Majestic is the Taqui Taqui Dance -- Majestic is a great place and i would absolutely go back!!

<Content>RELAXINGLY BEAUTIFUL!!! Just returned last evening from Majestic in Punta Cana. We were concerned because of recent negative reviews...WHAT DO PEOPLE EXPECT IN A VACATION??? We got everything and we wanted and more from ours. From the time we arrived, met with Richard, (who helped book our reservations in the specialty restaurants, introduced us to key staff, to a complete guided tour of the resort, then guided us to our suite) a big THANK YOU to you Richard!!! The beach was SPECTACULAR (PRETTIEST SAND I HAVE EVER SEEN), the rooms were very nice, (very few or no mosquitos, FOOD WAS APLENTY(some strange but delicious choices), CASINO $$$ PROFITABLE, grounds beautiful, Spa treatments RELAXING, I could go on. On day 3 we received fruit and cheese platters, Day 4 sushi  wine...We were treated very well and and only booked the least expensive room option. The staff although there was a language barrier, tried to be as helpful as they could understand. The only thing I would change if I could would be to include room service in all of the room choices, other than that, GO...RELAX...ENJOY!!!

<Content>Majestic is truly majestic just returned from 16 nights at the beautiful Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. Here is our review: We arrived late on Sunday January 13th and were quickly taken to a room in Bldg 1 on the main floor. This was not the type of room we had asked for and so asked to be moved. They were able to move us the next morning to a third floor room in Bldg 3 which was more to our liking. The only problem with the room location was it was directly in front of the activity pool which was quite noisy with excercise and dance classes each day from 4 till 6 pm. We stayed in that room but next time would probably have tried to get one closer to the main lobby area which would have been quieter. Other than the odd late night returnees waking us we found the room very nice. We loved the shower and double sink area with the shelf and drawers most of all. We also had a leather couch and large coffee table and the balcony was a great place to relax at the end of the day. The grounds are beautiful and the main lobby building is spectacular. Huge two story marble filled with 20 or 30 couch seating areas. Very nice and spacious. We spent a lot of time at both the pool and the beach. We thought the beach was fabulous with tons of powdery sand and lots of waves to play in. We especially liked the light beige beach chairs as they seemed of a much nicer quality than any of the other resorts. It didn't matter what time of day we went to the beach, we never had a problem finding chairs or a palapas to sit under. If yu wanted lots of personal space, you could easily find that at the top area of the beach. It was a bit closer down near the water but not overly so. Some days we found the beach a bit too windy, and so we spent time at the fabulous pool. Long winding and not too cold for us at all. If you don't like the loudness of the activity area, there is plenty of quiet spots closer to the main lobby with an exceptional bar playing lovely Dominican music. Again, we never had any trouble finding somewhere to sit (even shade) at any time of the day.  We loved the evening bands which played on the open air courtyard from 7 - 10pm each night. There is a dancefloor and lots of tables and chairs to relax after dinner. The bands were great, too. There weren't many waitresses so we usually got up and got our own drinks. We went there almost every night. We didn't see any of the shows so cannot comment on those. A nice feature was an early evening movie each night in the theatre, all animated for kids to watch. We had a one hour session with one of the photographers and bought the cd with all of the pics. She did a fabulous job taking us around the resort and shot some great photos. Thanks Lucy The food was more than adequate at the buffet and we ate there most meals. They just started putting signs on the different foods the day before we were leaving. It was interesting trying to choose a meal before that, but they had a lot of variety, beef and pork and chicken every night. Also, chili, lasagna, pastas, pizza, seafood and much more. We also tried the Steakhouse, the Gourmet and the Asian restaurants. All served nice meals. We had our anniversary dinner at the gourmet and they decorated the table with beautiful flowers especially for us. We also saw couples having special dinners on the beach.The staff were helpful and friendly. Hola to Joe and Marian and Cesar and thanks for making our trip even more fun. Overall, we loved this resort. We have stayed at 4 other all inclusives in the caribbean and thought this one rated very high on our scale. We probably will book to go back there next year.

<Content>Horrible experience. First the positive(not much):-The beach area is very nice and so is the ocean- We had suite with living room and 2 terraces.Negative:-concept of Customer Service IS NOT there on any level.-Food is not edible.-Though room is nice the bed is extremely uncomfortable.-Mosquitoes! We go to all-inclusive once a year and I know what to expect from these places. So I was not expecting Ritz but this was just ridicules. This is probably the worst experience I had with the resort.

<Content>Very nice place For starters, I am a little bit of a snob when it comes to traveling. I like to stay in nice places and do a lot of research before I travel. I was a little worried as I approached this trip with some of the mixed reviews for this property. What I have found is that some people just like to complain. Here is what I was concerned about before I went and what I found to be true:1. Mosquitos- We had no problems at all2. Unfriendly staff- They were great and helpful.3. Food- It is an all inclusive so you can't expect awesome food but it was actually very good. Probably the best I have experieced in an all-inclusive. Dinners: Steakhouse was real good. (Get the Churasco) Table side at Japanese was good. Le Gourmet had Tenderloin that was real good and last but not least, the lobster at the outdoor seafood place was small but very good( Get 2 if you are a big eater) Lunch was average and breakfast was great.4. Food poisioning- 3 out of 4 of us had no problem, but my friend had stomach issues on the last day and felt awful for 2 days afterwards. Unfortunatley, in a 3rd world country this is a possibilty. Don't drink the water!! 5. Bad pillows. I brought my own but I don't think I would have had problem had I not.6. Beach towels- Ask for extra cards when you check in but other than that they were easy to get and exchange(Behind spa)7. Constuction- We were near it and it wasn't a big deal. We were out of our room by 9am and came back at 6pm to shower and go backTo conclude:The place is very well maintained and the Michael Jackson show and the differnet star show were entertaining. Also, I would get taxi from the airport for $35 instead of using your vouchers as you are 35 minutes away by taxi and by voucher with all the stops you will be 2 hours whic just starts things off bad. Also, make sure verify your accomodations before you accept your room. We had paid for ocean front and when they had none available they upgraded us to pool suite, not ideal but had I not verified, I might have been hassled like my friend who had to go thru the process of switching rooms.Relax and enjoy. The beach and pool are fantastic.

<Content>'Fabulous Wedding-Moon' at the Majestic We stayed at the Majestic from January 19th-26th, 2008 and were married there on Wednesday January 23rd. We cannot say enough about how wonderful the Majestic is. The people, the culture and the overall beauty of the Island itself. We arrived at the Majestic around 9:30 p.m. on the 19th and were greeted with a warm towel and and a cold majestic, a drink that instantly became one of our favourites for the week. From there we were greeted by the reception staff with a friendly smile and were given our room keys.  The rooms are beautiful, we had an upgraded suite with a jacuzzi outside due to the fact that we were getting married at the resort however, all of our guests rooms were equally as beautiful. We loved our maid, left her something every day. We recieved a welcome platter of fruit and cheese in our room as well as a bottle of champagne. As a special bonus for getting married there we recieved a rose petal filled bubble bath the night of our wedding along with a rose petal pathway leading to a rose petal filled bed. We also recieved chocolate covered strawberries, 2 bottles of red wine and a fabulous breakfast in bed the next morning. WONDERFUL SERVICE! We cannot even put into words how beautiful the majestic beach and pool area are, they are absolutley fabulous!! A++++! You can walk for miles in either direction on the white powder sand, looking our onto the crystal clear turquoise water. NEVER a problem to find a lounge chair at either the beach or the pool.If you are considering getting married at a destination location we would 100% recommend the majestic, they do a fabulous job. Larissa and Aurelio are wonderful at making sure your wedding day is exactly as you have dreamed. The floral department at the resort will make any flower arrangement you request, I provided them with a picture and they made and exact replica, absolutley beautiful! Kiko, our photographe was equally as wonderful, the pictures he took of us were original and outstanding, we cannot praise him enough! We were married in the gazebo at 5:00 p.m. and had alot of our pics taken on the beach, it was wonderful, we would not change a thing. The resort does a wonderful job of decorating the gazebo area to make it just breathtaking. We also had our reception at the steak house, our waiters were amazing and the service we recieved was top notch, the table setting was beautiful and our entire party absolutely loved it! We could go on and on about how wonderful everything was but the bottom line is we cannot say one bad thing about this resort. We have travelled throughout the Carribbean and this resort and location was by far our favourite. Please remember to tip the staff at this resort, they work long hours for little money and do not see their familes for weeks on end. However, they never take the smile off of their face. Take the time to talk with them about their lives and families and appreciate what they do for you!We would also like to say that we had 2 children in our wedding party (1  4 years old) and the staff, especially the animation staff treated them wonderfully. Make sure you ask the bartender to make your children a mickey mouse (7-Up mixed with grenadine). They will glady do so! Cheers out to the animation team as well, they are fabulous! They make each day down on the beach fun and entertaining, take the time to get to know them, they will never forget your name. A very special shout out to Felix the omlette man, he is amazing. Make sure you get in line for an omlette just so that you can have the pleasure of meeting him, he is wonderful!Good food, good drinks, excellent service and 5 stars all around, we will definately return!!! On a final note, we would like to say to those who have complained that some of the staff do not speak fluent english, yes you are correct and that would be because you are in a foreign country and their first language is not english. Many of them need to be able to speak at least 3 languages so cut them a break. If they came to your home they would not expect you to speak spanish. Take some time to learn their beautiful language, they greatly appreciate your broken spanish! If you are considering or have booked your wedding at the Majestic and have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me at jennbarr3@hotmail.com and I will gladly help in anyway I can or send you pictures of what a beautiful job they do!Cheers!!

<Content>If you want a holiday then this is it Arrived on Jan 3, 2008 at 6:30 pm, very cloudy and not warm. On the 4th it rained like I have never seen it and my wife and I were worried. We had stayed in the Dominican before at the Barcelo Palace four years ago and had a great time. On Saturday the 5th the sun came out, my wife started talking to me again and our super holiday began.Check-in----Handled very fast,efficiently and assured by Angel (he was great all through our stay) that the room he gave us was one of the best. Jason our Porter walked us to our room and told us all about the hotel. Apparently we had arrived during their Christmas season( it runs to Jan 6 down there) and the hotel was only 1/3 full. It filled up a few days later. Angel and Victor Pollantis (the front desk manager) are very efficient and handled some of my small concerns immediately. Porters-Edgar was super, very attentive to our wants--need anything just get him to do it, a real great guy. Jason also.Room--Angel was right. I thought it was the best room in the hotel and I walked around the whole hotel on our first day just to make sure. Because of the open floor plan of the rooms (tub and sinks, make-up area are open) closed doors on the shower and toilet area, in this room we never had to close our curtains. It was exactly half way between the Lobby and the beach, an elevator just steps away down the hall, and across from the best place to be at the pool. There was a bridge right below our room.Had a big balcony for happy hour,a view of the ocean,and a total view of the pool. When the lights came on at night it was spectacular.Very very clean. For me the best rooms are 2231 or 2331.Beach-Awesome and lots of it. Not crowded even with full hotel. Lots of lounges and cabanna's and a beautiful view of a sunken, grounded frieghter. Beach drink service also.Restaurants-La Gormet the best,Chinese next, the rest are like everywhere, sometimes great sometimes not.Food--Very good for the Dominican (not quite as good as Mexico) but lots of variety, breakfast was the best, soups and breads down there are great. Lots of pasta and fruit. If you can't find something to eat here then you are lame.Felix is the man to see at Breakfast and he does all the omlettes and greets everyone with a smile and sometimes a story. Super guy.Hotel---Very nicely laid out, super gardens and walkways,nice place to get married, went there for a friends wedding and saw two a day. Some at the beach and some at the big pavillion. Lots of bars throughout the hotel and grounds.Pool--the nicest pool in all our travels. Stretches the full length of the hotel,has four bars servicing it, lots of cabanna's and lounge s,the main pool bar is at the end by the beach and is very busy with lots of activities and music, the middle(across from our room)very quiet and had a shelf under the water to pull your lounge chair onto when it becomes hot. I really liked this pool and by the way--the cleanest of any we have stayed at.Staff--Like any hotel some are better at their jobs than others. The Majestic is new so they have some new staff where the English is not up to speed, but again how's your Spanish? Its not that they won't sometimes help you its that a lot of time they don't know what you want. I find the Dominican people to be very kind and attentive and like any where some are not. One thing is for certain--if they do a good job for you or you are asking for something better than average then do the right thing and TIP.Its the same as here--want something special then tip.Special people--There are probally more than this but these are the staff that I came to know.Victor Pollantis---(Front Desk Manager)--AwesomeAngel--(Front Desk)---Awesome -- Angel (middle swim bar should be wearing t-shirt that says Whata'sup)--AwesomeEdgar---(Porter)--Awesome----Jason--(Porter)-Awesome and of course Felix--(Chef) should be on T.V.Special mention to Dianna (temporary guest services) for going beyond the call of duty. I had some tricky things I had to do and she got them done.My wife and I have travelled throughout the Caribbean and Mexico, Myan Riveria, Hawaii and some Asia. Six cruises. We are well travelled and stay mostly in these types of hotels. I will give you my honest opinion of this hotel.( I know it should be 5 to 1 star rating but we have stayed at so called 5 star hotels)Pool-6 star, Beach-6 star Rooms 5 star Food 4 star Entertainment 4 star and staff 4 star over all. That is comparing this to all the others that we have stayed at, all over the world. My honest opinion is if you are going for sun and sandy beaches with a super pool then this place is for you. We will return. I did not include pictures.Thankyou Majestic for a super holiday.

<Content>Majestic - Amazing Vacation We just returned yesterday from a 7-night stay (Jan 22 - 29) at the Majestic. There were three couples in our travel party and all of us were just amazed at the quality of this resort. Yes, I was glancing at the reviews prior to departure and became a slight concerned, but upon arrival, those thoughts were put to rest immediately I had emailed Richard requesting our rooms be close by and he managed to have us just three doors down. For any questions please feel free to contact him - he is such a nice man and will certainly do everything he can to accommodate you and your wishes. All the staff is so polite and always smiling, they will do everything they can to make your vacation excellent. We stayed in building 3. Had a wonderful view of the pool area. This pool is amazing, runs the entire length of the grounds. The rooms are spacious and well maintained, our room was cleaned every morning by 10 am - no concerns what so ever. They even added some nice touches, like wine and strawberries etc one night, and on another we had a plate of Japanese along with bottle of wine awaiting us. We arrived shortly after noon and our rooms were not ready, but were directed to the buffet to have a bite to eat and returned 30 min later and they were ready, no big deal. The beach has to be the most beautiful I have seen, white sand that goes on for miles. The food was excellent; we enjoyed the French restaurant the best. There was plenty of variety and it was good. You have to venture out at times when traveling and try different things, you will be amazed at what you find. Of course it will not be like we are used to day in and day out at home, although, I know for a fact no one would go hungry there unless they wanted to because they wanted to be too fussy. None of us experienced any medical ailments due to the food, maybe a little from the consumption of tasty drinks 鈥?but that was self inflicted (lol). Trying to keep this short all I can say is that anyone who is either thinking of / or is booked to attend the Majestic will not be disappointed. It is truly amazing. So don鈥檛 be concerned, attend with an open mind and you will too return with great vacation memories as we did.  Thank you Majestic for a excellent vacation.

<Content>paradise found I stayed at the Majestic Colonial from Jan 19th-26th. I booked this trip several months in advance based on all the good reviews on this site. For some reason about 1 month prior to leaving the reviews changed and I became nervous.....well I had nothing to worry about!!!This place is a little slice of heaven!!I will try to keep my review short. We checked in at 11:00pm Saturday evening.....did not receive towel or drink but we didn't care. Let me say that the following is the only glitch to our stay. We received a key for our room and I had e-mailed Richard in advance for a room in building 2 or 3. Our room was in building 3 on 4th floor. Upon getting to your room our key did not work. My husband went back to front desk to have key re-coded. After 10 minutes we came back and tried key. it worked but unfortunately the room was already occupied! We were embarrassed....also frustrated and tired from the flight we went back to the desk with all our luggage for a third time. Victor was there and immediately rectified the situation by giving us a free upgrade to a majestic colonial suite ( poolside) second building. We could not have been happier. It was beautiful and 15 minutes after we got to our room Victor called to make sure we were satisfied.I won't get into all the details of our experience but what I can say is that the people at this resort aim to please and it shows. Drinks never go empty and I have never had faster service. The food was delicious and lots of variety. I never got sick and neither did my husband and we ate and drank everything. The beach and pool were unreal and pictures posted do not do it justice. There was lots to do and a variety of day trips. I would recommend the Outback Safari. For $90 you are taken to the Dominican countryside and visit a typical Dominican home, coffee plantations, a schoolhouse, a ranch and finish the day at a secluded beach.We are already planning our trip for next year and will take our children next time as the children at the resort seemed to be having so much fun.I can't imagine why some of the reviews were so negative before I left. I feel some people are too picky or spoiled and expect the moon. Vacation is what you make of it.Please pm me if you have any questions and have a great time.....I am missing it already.

<Content>Simply Wonderful. Returned from the Majestic yesterday and I feel compelled to write a review to make up for all the bad reviews that have been showing up recently. This is my sixth time to the Dominican Republic, and I have also been to Mexico, St. John, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, Aruba, etc., so I think I have a fairly strong basis for comparison. Basically, the bottom line here is that for a resort in Punta Cana, the Majestic is fantastic. Obviously, you are not going to the Ritz, and you should not expect the hotel to resemble the Ritz. However, for a resort in the Dominican Republic, the resort is fantastic. I'll break my review down into categories:Rooms:We stayed in an Oceanfront room and it was amazing. In fact, it was why we chose to stay at the resort. We had a huge semi-private balcony overlooking the ocean with a hot tub from which we could gaze at the stars at night. It was magical. I know a lot of fuss has been made about the bathroom set-up, musty odors, etc., but none of that was a problem for us. No funky smells, room generally cleaned by noon, mini-bar restocked daily--no problems. Also, there was a DVD player and an espresso machine in the room we didn't know to expect, which was awesome, as well as the normal champagne, rum, and whiskey. One really nice thing about these rooms was how quiet they were. No loud neighbors to deal with.Food:Last year we stayed at the Iberostar, and in the past we've stayed at the Paradisus and in general the food is the same as at all other resorts, though perhaps not quite as good. The fruit and vegetables spread is amazing; the desserts are enticing; but the overall hot food rotation is not as diverse as some may like. It didn't really bother em though. We mostly ate at the main buffet since they had better fruits, but I have to say the langosta (lobster) at the seafood restaurant was superb. I thought I was going to be annoyed that the main buffet was inside and not open air like at Iberostar, but it actually meant that there were no flies buzzing about, which I hadn't thought of. Oh yes, and there is much mention of the pasta bar in these posts, but also worth mentioning is the grill stations, which have great meat and seafood offerings.Beach and Pool:We're more beach people, and as expected, we never had any problem finding chairs. However, one thing that did bother me a tiny bit is that there is less privacy at the beach than at the Iberostar. The chairs are just packed in more tightly. it is not a big deal, especially since we had our own private balcony, but just worth noting. At the pool there were also always chairs available, fyi, though we didn't hang out there much.Walking on the beach was great from the Majestic, because in one direction (to the left) you could reach undeveloped parts of the beach, while in the other direction you could walk past tons of resorts and do a lot of people watching.Bugs: We didn't see any and only got a couple of mosquito bites. I didn't need bug spray or anything, even though we brought some.Entertainment:This is not Broadway people! The shows were fun and amusing when we made it to them. What we also really liked was the live music that played every night at the bar near the buffet. It was from like 7 pm to 10 pm or something, and just a nice touch I haven't seen at any other resorts. Gym:We went for the first few days then took our runs to the beach. Of note: the machines are good enough, but the AC does not feel strong enough after ten minutes, and the music is played so loud my ears were ringing when we left the room. I'm sure we could have asked the guy to turn it down, but I guess we were embarrassed or something. It wound up deterring me from going back in there.I think that's all the really important stuff I wanted to mention. All these bas reviews coming in before our trip made me super nervous, but everything went smoothly and without a hitch, and we had a superb vacation. You will too!

<Content>Majestic Colonial - Resort is beautiful but food not 5 star We stayed at the Majestic Colonial Jan 19 - 26, 2008. This was our 3rd trip to Dominican, we had stayed at the RIU Taino in 2004 and Bavaro Princess in 2007.Check - in: We arrived at 1pm and our room wasn't ready - no big deal - put on shorts and went down to beach. Room was ready at 2:30pm.Restaurants: Buffet had lots of variety but we soon found there was the same food each day. I enjoy my meat and potatoes which I had trouble finding. I didn't find a good selection of either chicken or pork. Breakfast is like it is at any other resort. It got to the point where I ate pasta 2x a day for 6 days. We went to the Taino Restaurant which serves Dominican/Mexican food. I ordered the trio which had chicken, pork and beef. Unfortunately I've never seen pork that when you cut it the middle is almost red, not even pink but red. Obviously I chose not to eat it. My husband had beef/chicken fahitas and immediately after leaving restaurant felt sick to his stomach for the rest of the night and until mid morning night. I was disappointed in the variety of foods.Beach: very nice, big waves in morning but by noon waves had calmed down enough to enjoy swimming. I found the beach nicer at the Bavaro Princess. One thing we noticed there was no beach bar - you had to get off the beach to bar (even though it's not to far). They do have a waiter who takes your order on the beach but not around very often.Rooms: Very nice, large - nothing bad to say about them. Not sure why people complained about toilet being out in the open. It is behind a glass door. I love the Dominican people, they are so friendly and gracious and would not hesitate to go back to Dominican again. Would I go back to the Majestic Colonial - no but then we do like to stay at different places.

<Content>Decadent- superb We arrived at the Majestic Colonial Hotel on Saturday evening, Jan.12/08. We were immediately thrilled with our choice of hotels.The service was excellent. We had a Majestic Junior suite with jacuzzi in the room and a jacuzzi out on our patio too and had the pool about 12 feet away from our patio. A swim up bar was about 150 feet away from our room. What more could you want. We tried various restaurants and enjoyed all of them. The daily programs were wonderful. Jimmy, of the Activation crew was a great inspiration to my wife for the step exercise session along with another very muscular chap(forgot his name but he was incredible). We enjoyed the evening entertainment. The beach at Punta Cana was the best we have ever seen -It surpassed Puerto Vallarta and Veradero. It even topped our favourite beach at home Wasaga Beach which will always be special for us anyway. One great item for the beach is a 52 oz. Bubba cup obtained from Canadian Tire. Your beer stays cold and it saves trips back to the bar ( the bar is quite close to the beach anyway) Great holiday-can't wait to return to the same hotel again

<Content>Fantastic! I just returned from a week at the Majestic and am thrilled with the choice to stay there. I have to admit I was a little worried about going after reading a lot of negative reviews just before leaving, but now that I've been myself, I have NO IDEA what those people were complaining about. I find some of the reviews on here a little misleading. I chose another resort last year based on fantastic reviews and was VERY disappointed (Breezes in Jibacoa, Cuba). The Breezes was a horrible experience, yet most people loved it! Huh.RoomsWhen we arrived (very late at night since our flight was delayed) we were put in a room on the first floor, facing the construction. The next day we asked to be moved and got a room on the 4th floor, also facing the construction. I do admit that there were a few too many mosquitoes in the first floor room, but I only saw one or two for the rest of the week in the 4th floor room. Also, the room on the 4th floor had very high ceilings, and was much more pleasant as a result. The construction wasn't exactly great to look at but it didn't really bother me as I only slept and showered in the room, and spent the rest of the time on the beach.FoodThe food was great. I love seafood and there was fresh grilled fish every night (salmon, maro, sea bass...). Also, the seafood restaurant served lobster! The Gourmet restaurant was great too. I eat out a lot in Toronto, and I wasn't disappointed at all.Best of all, you can get premium liquor in the lobby bar. :)BeachThe beach was amazing. Soft white sand stretching in either direction. You can safely walk for a long time in either direction, especially to the east, as it is lined with other resorts. ServiceI thought the service was great. It was MUCH friendlier than in Cuba (both of us visited Cuba last year, at different resorts). Although the resort was at capacity, you never had to wait for anything, as there were so many people around to help you with everything. Comparison to other ResortsBesides the Breezes in Cuba, I've also stayed at the Barcelo Tropical Beach, Mayan Riviera. I really enjoyed my stay there as well, but I think the Colonial beat it out because the rooms were nicer, the beach was nicer, and it was less money.We also did some reconnaissance on the other resorts in the area. The Riu looked horrible (it stank and looked old). The Iberostar looked old and cheap and crowded. The Bahia Principe looked as nice as the Colonial, but it was huge and seemed very crowded and had way too many kids around.

<Content>Second time at the Majestic and STILL plan on going back... This was the second time in just under a year that I traveled to the DR and stayed at the Majestic. My first experience was a gift given to my girlfriend and I as a graduation gift. We stayed at the Majestic for just over a week around the end of May, 2007. This most recent trip was a family get-away for 5 in mid Jan. 2008, with myself and my siblings, all in our late 20's to early thirties, and our free-spirited, energetic mother all staying at the Majestic for 6 days. The two trips could not have been anymore different and yet each was so special and amazing that I have no doubts I will return.  My girlfriend and I spent a ton of time at the beach and doing the hotel and additional activities (such as snorkeling. $30 and totally worth it... be sure to snag some rolls from the breakfast buffet to feed the fish) that we were exhausted by the end of each day. We stayed mostly to ourselves though met people easily and occasionally would have lunch with a friendly group while reserving dinner time and the evening for just the two of us. My family, on the other hand, spent most of our day at the pool, were very social with other guests, and constantly relied on he staff for entertainment and conversation. (Tomas in the French restaurant,Edward in the Japanese, and Mercedes at all the different bars, were all extremely friendly, genuine, and amazing in who and what they remembered each day considering the 12+ hour days they work). Each night we'd head out to the shows and be amused by the wackiness, though in both trips I thought only the Michael Jackson show was consistently great. The circus of dreams was amazing this time (and I don't recall seeing it offered when I was there previously). We almost always stayed out late, closing some of the bars and staying at the disco into the wee hours. The Majestic isn't a great place for singles... but if you're willing to go the extra mile, act like you're on vacation rather than at a club in your hometown, and be as outgoing as possible (perhaps thanks to a bit of liquid courage?) it's very easy to meet people and you'll find that the folks there really are interested in meeting others. Some people have posted here that they were upset about the lack of articulate English spoken by the staff. Personally, having learned some of the island's history and seeing the lifestyle most of the island inhabitants live, I am constantly amazed by how pleasant and wiling to try the staff at the Majestic are. Having been to Europe several times, I always find that the responsibility for communication has always fallen on the local's ability to speak English while my own attempts to speak the native languages are almost always met with scorn. At the Majestic the staff are always pleased when the guests attempt to converse with them in Spanish and it's amazing how well you get to know someone simply by struggling through an attempt to speak each other's language. I found I felt much better about being liked for trying. The weather was great during both trips despite the different times of year, though a quick shower here and there in the afternoon was common both trips. We were well prepared from reading the reviews on what to bring, what not to eat, and I once again avoided being sick by drinking bottled water, not eating salad or washed, cut fruit, and by being conservative in what I chose to eat (are people REALLY going to the DR to eat the sushi?). Overall an amazing place. I could easily see myself going back time and time again.

<Content>OMG!!!! Loved the Majestic Just returned home from Punta Cana last night. Our stay at the Majestic was the best ever. If we go back to DR we will stay at the Majestic. I will try to keep this short but I have so much to say it may be difficult.Check- In - quick with no delays. Nice warm wash cloth and fruity drink.Hotel Room - I felt like a princess. The jaccuzi was so nice, and the king size four poster bed, too nice. We had booked a pool side room but they had over booked that class. We were given a room with an ocean view and our doorstep was on the beach. I was upset at first that I did not get the room I had requested but I soon began to realize that we had one of the best rooms on the resort. If we go back next year, I will request the same room. Beach - great beach, clean with lots of chairs and palapas to sit under. Drink service on the beach was second to none. Denny our waiter made sure we were never with out a drink. He was friendly and courteous at all times, just the best.Pool - It was clean and well maintained, but we spent all our time at the beach.Bars - Our favourite spot was the Piano Bar. The bartenders were the greatest. Special mention to Roberto, Maria, and Mike. There are so many bars at the Majestic we never visited all of them, but we did give a good shot. If you should have the pleasure of having Angelle (beautiful girl with a smile that lights up the room and eyes that sparkle) as your bartender ask her for her special drink the Angelle - so good. Food - great, never had a problem finding something that I liked. The baked goods were awesome. The food at the Mexican and the Steak House was great. We also ate at the French restaurant, excellent. We never had time to go to all the Restaurants but I am sure none of them would have been a disappointment. The waiters were great, our drinks were never empty. Our comfort and pleasure was their only concern.Activities- you have to book your tours with your travel agent rep at the hotel. We went to Santo Domingo. It was an awesome day with so much to see but it is a huge day and you will spend about 7 hours or more on the bus and some rough roads at times. It would have been a better excursion if it was done in two days. Our guide was great - Joel - very well educated person with a great love for his Country. We did not realize that there was scuba/snorkle shop on the beach with many services. We should have attended our orientation session.Staff- This is the part of the magic of the Majestic. From check-in to check-out you are treated so well. Friendly, courteous and helpful. Try to learn a little Spanish before you go as most of the staff are limited in English. Sorry this was such a long review, but it was such an awesome experince and I just wanted to share.

<Content>Party of 10 had a Great Time We travelled from Toronto to Punta Cana from Jan 12 - 19 and stayed at the Majestic. Like everyone, you read the travel reviews prior to departure. We were nervous but figured with a party of 10 it would be fun anyways. You can't please everyone and have to explore situations for yourself.We had the best vacation of our lives at the Majestic. The food, entertainment, Carribean Street with nightime snacks and the disco was outstanding. OUr friend ended up in the Michael Jackson show and had the whole place laughing.Overall, we were treated with respect, smiling faces and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Lucy who took pictures around the resort was such a joy to meet. The pool is the best I have ever seen and the beach is so beautiful. You can't go wrong here. They love to say What's Up at the swim up bar often.The choice of food is good, we all gained weight this trip. The drinks are great. The breakfast buffet was my favourite with the omelet stationOf course there is always going to be little things that you would like changed but that is normal. And remember you are in a third world country. We didn't fully enjoy the room set up with the bath tub out in the open but it didn't ruin the trip.We rate the Majestic 5 Stars and would definately return.We would recommend everyone to visit the Majestic. We have been to other resorts in Punta Cana and this one is our favourite.HOpe this helps anyone who is going to Punta Cana!

<Content>Not what was expected We had already booked a trip and than looked at some pictures on web site as well as from a friend of a friends. It was EHH and we thought what is that??!!!, this water/pool going around the hotel and all of it in general. Let me just say that the pictures even though are true do not hold justice to the outlay/look of the hotel and its surroundings, including the pool =). Which was huge and not all of it was shallow. I am more of an ocean person but I did go in the pool. The beach was clean and well looked after, just like most of the hotel property in and out. All the staff at all times where friendly, and extra nice. Ex: We arrived for take off at 11am and got to the hotel a little after 7pm, our departure was delayed (no food on plane) and we were starved, the buffet was closed and everywhere else you had to look presentable, which we were not, in any event they where sympathetic and we were seated and served, smiles all around! Great food and different variety, also the hotel has 3 or so restaurants where you can make a reservation, no need at the buffet. Great rooms with balcony that has a light, yay! We had a problem with a door key, someone was right over the few times it happened, 1 time longest wait: 7min. The room was very clean at all times, spacious and nice, the only thing the bed was not to my liking, could have been more comfy considering how nice everything else is. There are representatives at the hotel to book a tour if one is desired (for this trip we were beach bums), also beach activities scuba diving, snorkeling, etc鈥?Hotel had a decent size casino, with tables as well as slots. A recommended all inclusive stay!

<Content>Great Time Just returned from the Majestic on the 19th. We had a great time. Loved the whole week. The room was beautiful....nice view.....overlooking the pool and partial view of the ocean......The jacuzzi in the room was a special touch with the robes and slippers......we used them everyday.......The choice of foods and number of restaurants had to keep anybody pleased......if you had a problem then you had to be a fuss-pot because if you didn't like one place you could always go to another. They didn't take your room number down and make you feel like you didn't have a choice. You could eat wherever you wanted whenever you wanted. We had no problem making reservations for the Hibachi or the Gourmet. The restaurant manager Francisco impressed me. What a hard working manager. You would fine him at any restaurant at any time of the day. You can tell he was overseeing that all runs smoothly.Just one little tip for the folks with failing eye sight - bring a small flashlight to the restaurants to read the menus.....the lighting is dim and the table candles didn't do the trick.The beach was beautiful. You didn't have to worry about shells or rocks. You could walk barefoot for miles without watching your step. The blue water was amazing. I felt like a kid again in the ocean.I felt safe at the resort.....we even forgot to lock our safe one day (stupid move) but not one penny was touched. Everything was there including cash, jewelry, credit cards, electronics, etc.There was a tapping noise at night but it was the trap door for room service. Just had to secure it. The light came in the room at night thru the balcony but that was our fault. We didn't realize there was another set of room darkening drapes we could have pulled. Found them after a few nights......dahhhhhhhhh......we got a good laugh at that one....The entertainment staff was good. Don't miss the Michael Jackson show.This year is our 40th anniversary and we felt like newlyweds again at the Majestic. It was better than our honeymoon, what with that jacuzzi.....WOW........and it was always a pleasure to watch a bride walk across the resort or a couple getting married on the beach.This is our 3rd time to D.R., and we've been to many other all inclusives throughout the Caribbean. We enjoyed our stay at the Majestic. Thanks Richard for all your help, for answering my emails, greeting us upon arrival......and letting the Sun Shine all week......our prays were answered.....now I'm sporting a nice suntan.Adios to the Majestic until we meet again......PS - You can always bring your own portable DVD player and movies in case you get a rainy day.

<Content>Bad Experience Me, my husband, and my three teenagers visited this hotel for a long weekend. It was nothing short of disappointment after disappointment. When we arrived, our rooms were not ready which is nothing really out of the ordinary. We were told to leave our bags sit outside near the bellmen (open air lobby). We weren't comfortable leaving the bags but were not given a choice. There was nowhere else to store them so we left them and went to have lunch. We found the food to be mediocre at best and mostly everything tasted bland and exactly the same. The staff was friendly but many times did not speak English.After lunch we were given our room keys. I specifically asked not to have rooms with a view of the new construction. Not only did we end up with one room with a construction view, but two! I went back to the front desk to have our rooms changed. They offered no help. I asked to speak with the concierge who helped me prior to visiting, Rafael, and he too said there was nothing they could do. I was told one room might open up that we could move to but then our rooms would not be next to each other. We stayed put only to see several people checking in to new rooms later that day .... close to each other. The rooms are layed out nice and look nice in pictures but they smell and are dirty. There were stains on the couch, the two throw rugs by the bed, the lamp shades, the walls, etc. Also, get a room as far away from the theatre and main bar. We were the seventh room in and were kept up through all hours of the night. A lot of partiers head to their rooms around 2:00 / 3:00 a.m. and are happy to scream about their enjoyment. The man in the room next to us arrived at his room drunk and making a lot of noise. He was arrested around 3:00 a.m. and his wife was escorted out the next morning. Do not count on the concierge, Rafael, for help. He booked us a taxi for our roundtrip airport  hotel  airport. When we found our driver he escorted us to his taxi. In a large parking lot full of nice, clean taxis, we were stuck in a small, very dirty, and run-down taxi. The driver spoke no english and didn't seem too concerned about us.So once we settled in we were excited to go to the beach. When we got down there, directly in front of the hotel there is about 15 feet of swimming from the shore. There is a safety line you can't go past because that's where they let their speed boat renters ride around. They told us we could go past the line but might get run over. If you wander down the beach to the far side of the resort it opens up much more. We took our snorkel gear but ... no coral and no fish. The coral is too far out to swim to. They offer free water sports for anything that doesn't have a motor. My daughter wanted to wind surf but was told it was too hard if she had never done it. My husband and I wanted to take a catamaran out. It was free AFTER you paid the $50 instruction fee. The only good thing I can say about the beach is that they had plenty of chairs for everyone.It rained all four days we were there so we explored the resort for fun things to do. The basketball court is not for basketball -- does not even have a hoop. The tennis courts are extremely run down. The outdoor ping pong table is warped and hard to play on. The pool water is very cold. The entertainment at night is almost as good as a high school performance. The towel hut only permits one towel per person. If your towel is taken or blows away, you pay for it. TV stations are poor in the room. To get the decent channels, including the weather channel, you have to pay extra. Personnel in the computer area are rude and unwelcoming. Board games are in spanish so you can't play them. The list could go on but I'm sure you get the gist of it.

<Content>5 stars for the colonial majestic I have never been treated so special then at the Majestic. All the staff that I encountered were so friendly and excellent at what they did. Special Thanks to Denny who was a pleasure as our Beach Consierge . He was so kind and considerate. A pure gentleman!Samuel, Melvin, Cesar and Sandy( Michael Jackson), Kelly, and Lina. The Animation Team. What a wonderful group of people. They each made you feel special and worked hard at everything they did. They were so entertaining. The Michael Jackson show was truely incredible. What talent!!!!!!Samuel the aerobics instructor was awesome, it was a really hard workout. Anita the bartender at the pool bar, was such a pleasure too. I would definitely go there again. there was nothing more you could ask for. This place should be a 5 star hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Great Vacation at The Majestic! We just returned last night from a 5 day stay (Jan 13-Jan 18) at the Majestic and we all miss the hotel and the wonderful staff so much - we are already looking forward to our next trip! We vacationed as a family (myself, mom, brother and sister with my brother-in-law) and all had a great time. We were well-prepared for the travel and hotel by reading the reviews and suggestions on Trip Advisor. We had a fantastic time and would like to thank ALL the staff for making our stay so wonderful, but a few stand out as exceptional -I.M. FELIX at the Buffet Restaurant Supreme omelet station. He made delicious omelets for my brother and I each morning and greeted us with a warm smile, helped us with our primitive Spanish and was so friendly with everyone - it was the best way to start the day! Felix is a huge asset to the hotel - he makes everyone feel special.ERNESTO at the pool bar and BENITO at the towel exchange were both always friendly and smiling. SANDY and the rest of the animation staff were great. They have the exhausting job of keeping up the energy around the pool bar and entertaining people from early morning to late at night in the disco - they should all be commended on their attitudes and amazing energy levels. The animation staff is also responsible for some of the evening shows and although the shows could be silly at times, the staff always worked hard to keep the crowd entertained.At night we enjoyed the outside bar, the indoor bar and the disco bar and MERCEDES worked a combination of all three - she was warm and friendly and most of all, fun! She was professional, her service was excellent and she made sure we were having a good time! She was interested in other people and would spend a bit more time talking with us which we all really enjoyed.We were able to get in to dinner at the Japanese grill without being able to get advanced reservations and we recommend to others that you at least ask and wait - the food was delicious. We had an excellent dinner at the French restaurant and both times at the steak restaurant. We recommend changing for lunch and going to the buffet instead of eating by the beach. Our mother did get sick at the beginning of the trip (she brushed her teeth with the water many times and ate lots of fresh fruit, but it's so hard to know the actual cause of her illness). The staff was great about helping us take food back to the room for her.We left a tip for the maid and beverage person each day and always had great service. We were prepared for uncomfortable beds and pillows, but we all slept great each night. Overall, our vacation was exactly what we had wanted - fun in the sun at the beach and pool. The exceptional service and friendly staff made the vacation much more memorable - we will be going back!

<Content>4th time fantastic My family and I have recently returned from another fantastic vacation at the Majestic Colonial. We stayed two weeks this time, from Dec.23/07 to Jan.6/08 and brought our two daughters ages 1920. After 4 visits to this resort it just keeps on getting better and better!! In fact we were sad to leave!(seldom does this happen on a 14 day holiday) We have traveled extensively though out the Caribbean, Europe and Asia(yes we have been to other resorts in Punta Cana)..although when you find a gem like the Majestic Colonial it is difficult to stay away!!!! Yes the property is magnificent, the grounds pristine, rooms clean and spacious, food varied and plentiful, BUT it is the people that make the real difference!! Senor Jaime Batle Manresa, (president of the Majestic Colonial) his son Senor Santiago and the entire family, make this resort stand out from the rest. The families commitment to their guests and their sincere personal touches make this resort stand out from the rest!! Special thanks to all members of the Majestic Colonial staff for your great service; including the professional Victor Pollantis at the front desk, the always present Senor Jose Maria and Senor Facundo, the gracious Jose Miguel Pichardo in the dinning rooms, Denny our beach concierge and Cesar in animation to name a few!We will be back......Carlos (Toronto)

<Content>Hard to beat experience First of all, very sorry if this is long but I feel I have to disbute all the negitive reviews being posted lately. I will begin by saying I will be comparing the Majestic only to the other resort that I stayed in Punta Cana and not any others as those were in different countries as that does have an impact in the total experience at a resort. So with that said we stayed at Paradisus Punta Cana around the same time last year. We had upgraded to Royal Service there as well and paid more last year than we did at the Majestic. So lets begin...I did not attach photos as every beautiful photo you will see here is accurate. The grounds, pool, beach, etc are amazing! I think resort grounds were nicer at Paradisus but Majestic's pool and beach beat Paradius. Majestic's ground is also smaller so getting around the resort is easier and I did like that better. Food, here I will say that Paradisus beats Majestic. However that said food at the majestic was very good, ALWAYS had enough to eat! My god I had to let hubby go to lunch by himself cause I could not keep eating or I would have exploded!!!! We traveled with our 23yo son and his 22yo girlfriend. Both have touching stomach issues, we (hubby  I) have never gotten sick during travel, our son had a very slight issue in Mexico, but we were very concerned with our son's girlfriend who does like to eat (tiny little thing too)! Not one of us had any issues at all, and all of us ate well. I do agree with other reviewer, steak house was amazing (ate there twice), Japanese was outstanding but we were only able to eat there once. Hubby said main buffet lunch and breakfast buffet was excellent. On our last day my son wanted to have lunch at main buffet for lunch as their hawian pizza he said was outstanding. Well when he got there they did not have any, when he asked the chef made it for him fresh and offered him an ENTIRE pizza to take with him!!!!!! He was so sad that he could not as we were on our way to the airport!!!! Rooms, here the Majestic has it hands down! We did upgrade to the swim out room, not a catagory at paradisus. Well, I'm not sure I could ever stay in another type of room. Just to sit at night, with my feet in the pool looking over the beautiful lighted grounds is an experience not to be missed! Now another reviewer said her children were scolded for swimming in the pool at night. The pool does close at 6pm and you are not to be in there after that as they are trating it. My son and his gf did go in and a staff member did come up to them, but he was soooo nice about it, made a joke even then went away! It is post all around the pool so they knew but took a chance and it was fun!Staff - All I can say is WOW! Because of this site just before I left I discovered the forum. There I learned of Richard and could email him witrh questions. Well I did and we discover that there was a mix-up in our rooms. I booked 2 swim-up rooms and reservations were for 1 swim-up and one standard. Richard gave me a heads up one this, I called my travel agent and she called them. Well let me tell you that mix up was corrected within 15 minutes! Days before we got there. Thanks Richard. A little tradition is that my husband always has flowers delivered to our room for my arrival on every trip. There was a problem here, not sure exactly why but Laura felt terrible. When we talked, I told Laura not to feel bad, instead of flowers hubby will have to take a trip to the jewelry store (lol). Well Laura took it upon herself to arrange a bath filled with bubbles and rose peddles and a bottle of wine to be in our room when we returned one evening. What a surprise, I thought hubby did it and he was just as suprised as me. We later found out it was Lauras doing. Again, you talk about attention to detail!!! Laura, you are amazing. The maids always had a smile, our room was always impecable. The wait staff were funny and friendly always. My glass was NEVER empty. The pool staff remembered our drinks after the first day (even down to the detail that in the am, we got our drinks w/o alchol but would start to add the rum around noon). Finnally the anamation team were excellent! To think that they had all of us up dancing the taqui-taqui (not sur of spelling) just blows my mind! This is a component that paradisus didn't even have. Then they would to those great shows at night! All I can say is WOW!Sorry this was so long, I just felt that I had to set the record straight. I don't know what others expect but I will tell you this, our travel rule is that if we return to the same destination we do not stay at the same resort. However....When we return to Puna Cana it will be a struggle to stay somewhere else! Thanks Majestic!

<Content>beautiful hotel, amazing pool. I had been reading the reviews beforehand and was getting quite nervous as some of the reviews were quite bad; however, these people writing these bad reviews have obviously never been to a three- or four-star hotel in D.R. so why they are comparing it to that is beyond me.We just returned from this gorgeous hotel yesterday (January 19). ROOMS: The rooms are absolutely gorgeous. Nicer than most rooms in hotels in U.S./Canada. The only thing about the room I did not like is the bathroom was quite open concept so not private at all but the shower was huge and everything was very clean. not damp or humid at all in the room like in some other hotels in the D.R. we've stayed in before. Huge bed. Beautiful.FOOD: Food was okay. The Steakhouse was very good. Mexican was pretty good as well. Only ate at the buffet for one dinner and it had good selection of stuff but nothing is labeled and lots of Domincan-style food. I would say the people that are complaining about getting sick are probably eating things that look sketchy and have been sitting out (eggs benedict, pre-cooked eggs) and you would get sick if you picked that off a buffet in Canada as well. Be choosy of what you eat and you will be fine. also, you really can't go wrong with things made fresh in front of you. If delicious food is important to you for your holiday, don't go to Domincan. It is not the same standards as Canada/U.S. and you will be disappointed if you go thinking that you are going to get the same quality in the buffets.DRINKS: pretty good. I recommend the Dirty Monkey. very yummy. lounge bars also had speciality drinks and quality is better than the beach and pool bars.GROUNDS: absolutely beautiful. constant staff everywhere cleaning and tending to things.SHOWS: I can't really comment on this one. We only went to one show but it was entertaining enough. POOL: Amazing. get a floating mat and float around the pool. There were also tons of activities here, both on the beach and the pool. Staff tries to get everyone involved and it was pretty entertaining. We had a great time at this resort and amazing weather. I would definitely go back if I was going to go back to Domincan.UNRELATED TO RESORT BUT PROBABLY GOOD TO KNOW: One thing I would recommend is pre-book your seats when you book your vacation. The flight we were on had a huge group and many people on our flight who were travelling as couples had to sit apart, including ourselves. Not a big deal if you are travelling with two adults but if you are travelling with children, you should definitely pre-book. Also, unrelated to the resort, don't go on the horseback riding excursion. It was extremely dangerous and not to North American standards at all. The horses were tired and unpredictable and only two guides for a group of about 20 to 30 people.

<Content>I fell in love...with the country, the people and the music.... It was my first trip to the Dominican Republic but not my last...for sure. A holiday I will never forget...Only a few days home, already want to go back!Good service from the first minute I got in to the hotel until I left.Beautiful ocean and beach, wonderful weather, Majestic is an excellent hotel (rooms where in I feel like a princess and good food (there are too many picky people in this world), very clean and with pretty surroundings.But especially ALL the people that work at the hotel made it a great stay. I have great respect for the hard working they do with such a great devotion, always smiling, singing and dancing! If you like the animation team keeps you busy during the day and night; all kind of (funny) games (armwrestling contest; thanks for the ron!), volleyball, aerobics, dancing, great shows at night and fun en la discoteca...TaquiTaqui time!Sandy, Taison, Leo, Samuel, Lina, Pablo, Blake, Mariel, Kely and all the people from the animation team I don't know by name....THANK YOU, for your hard work, happy faces and amazing dancing!muchos besos de Linda(Holanda)

<Content>......Just OK We arrived at the resort around 4pm. Got the whole wet towel and drink treatment and checked in. We get to the room we had been assigned and it took me 4.2 seconds to realize it wasnt the room category we booked. My first clue was that the room was on the second floor and we had booked a first floor room by the pool with a jacuzzi on the patio. So I called my travel agent who called the hotel and spoke with Victor. It seems that since our room category was overbooked they downgraded us. We went back to the front desk and Victor informed us that we would get a new room but that it wouldnt be ready until 7pm. We were soooo hungry but the only place for food was near the beach. They had what looked like hamburgers and hotdogs. I went for the hotdog as it looked more edible. Around 7pm we went back to the desk and the room STILL wasnt ready. However, Victor said he would show us the room to see if it would be ok. My hubby and I were driven around to our room which was #2351. *Also had electrical panel hanging off the wall* It was on the third floor oceanfront with a huge patio complete with lawn chairs and jacuzzi. It was a definite upgrade from the room we booked. *If you are interested in this room category....you cant see the ocean unless ur standing up on the patio. The ocean is not visible from the room itself* Victor was also helpful in arranging a surprise birthday celebration complete with cake for my hubby at the gourmet restaurant. He also allowed us to check out 2hrs later at no cost. Although we did have to wait 4 hrs for our room to be ready.The Good: -Friendly Staff *Victor was excellent*-Plenty of beach/pool chairs umbrella's.-Great Spa! Susana was wonderful!-Beautiful grounds-Clean-*really trying to come up with others*The Bad: -Hard to make reservations at the gourmet and hibachi restaurants. They wanted to make us a reservation at the hibachi for the night after we left. We complained and got a reservation with no problem. Even the gourmet restaurant claimed to be booked but always had tables available while we were there. -Stingy with the beach towels. 1 per person and only with a towel card...which we were not given at check in. Only 1 location to obtain/drop off towels.-Everything very spread out *although not a bad thing...except when you are hungry : )*-Food wasnt great. It didnt make me sick so that was a plus.

<Content>Our vacation in Paradise We spent one week from 1/9/08-1/16/02 at the Majestic Colonial and found it to be nothing short of paradise. From our arrival ,greeted with cool towels and tropical drinks,a warm and friendly staff and a lobby that took your breath away. You have to understand we have never done any vacation outside of the Jersey shore so we don't have much to compare but I can't imagine much better.Our room was beautiful with a view of the amazing pool. The beach was gorgeous and pristene and the water aqua blue.The beach consierges' Denny and Fermin were wonderful bringing our drinks throughout the day with big smiles and warm greetings.Our room was kept immaculate and decorated with hints of flowers to make the bath area welcoming. We later found our maid to thank her for doing such a beautiful job in our room. Her name was Julia. (not sure of the spelling)Food was good although my husband is a meat and mashed potato man and the beef was a little tough. We did find the chateau briaugne in th Rodeo Steakhouse to be excellent as well as the beef fillets found in the Supreme. A wide variety of fish and pork were also found.The entertainment was good but hails to the animation team for their friendliness and talents. Lina was an amazing dancer as well as a delightful person . They try so hard to get people involved in all activities throughtout the day as well as their entertainment shows at night. Mr. Majestic in particular. If you are bored it would be your own fault and if you find it less appealing than me you must be extremely spoiled.Neither of us speak Spanish which would have been helpful but the staff in all areas try to understand your needs and help in the most kind and friendly fashion as possible.Our vacation was the best ever and we need to attribute that to everyone we came in contact with on this trip.We also had gone through VIP to help us with excursions and general info and Jaima was the best.We will hold this place special in our hearts.Thanks for the memories!!

<Content>Wonderful time at the Majestic I just returned from a four night stay at the Majestic Colonial Hotel in Punta Cana. This was my first trip to the Dominican Republic. The customs and security process at the airport was simple and quick. I had prepaid for ground transfers and was sitting on the bus in no time. On this trip I was accompanied by four long time friends, all professional women and experienced travelers. We found absolutely nothing to complain about. We were met at the stairs of the resort upon our arrival by plentiful porters who handled our luggage carefully and efficiently. The check-in process was friendly if not as quick as we would have liked..but we were very impatient to start our fun. We had requested adjacent rooms, and the rooms we were assigned were only one room apart...so not too bad. The rooms were beautiful and spotless. The bed was amazingly comfortable and a really nice garden tub with jacuzzi jets. Houskeeping did a great job and was very unobtrusive. Our pool view was lovely....the grounds are meticulously landscaped and maintained. The pool is huge and very clean. We enjoyed the swim up bar where a really great bartender named Anita made us special drinks every afternoon. We met alot of friendly people from our country and others. Lots of lounge chairs for sunning and shade if you want that. We ate at almost all of the resturants at the resort. We were not able to get a reservation at the Japanese hibachi, but others said it was good. We had a reservation at the Le Gourmet...not fabulous, but good. The steak house was our first night and we were quite pleased with the selection and meal. This was a sit down meal with table service. We tried the seafood resturant the next night, this was the only one that I really didn't like at all. Great service, but I just didn't like the food. Could be just personal taste. Next night was the Chinese resturant. I was sold at the sushi bar. There is also a large buffet open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and another smaller, but not small!, resturant out by the beach. Very friendly and good service everywhere. The staff all do their very best to converse in English...which is more than I could do in their language. There was no irritation or impatience with our inability to speak Spanish. The beach was beautiful and clean. Again, lots of lounge chairs and cabanas. Our beach consierge, Denny, brought us any refreshments we could ask for with a smile. Great time! Every night and throughout the day, entertainment and activities were provided by a team of young, beautiful people called the animation team And they were animated for sure! They sang. They danced, They taught areobics and dance and played games and generally did everything they could to insure that all guests had a great time.Not only will I reccomend this resort to others, but I will surely go back myself.

<Content>we loved the Majestic We just returned this Morning from this lovely resort.we were there the 9th through the 17. I must say that before I left I was alittle worried about the resort. But please relax it was wonderful. From the moment we arrived Richard greated us and we were given a cool towel and a majestic drink. He showed us to our room which was very clean and decorated with flowers,we also had a bottle of champane waiting. We were on the third floor with a view of the pool. We could sit on our balcony and feel like we were a part of all the action going on by the pool. Our room was cleaned everyday by 10 am. We had 4 bottles of water and soft drinks left in the mini ref at that time. You could always ask at the bars for more water if you needed it. Food was very good I don't know how someone could not find something great to eat. At the buffet they was always management present to help you. If you had cold food just tell them they wanted nothing more that to make you happy. There was someone that made fresh omlets and crepes and waffles every morning just get your pick directly from them not off the buffet. The bakery was excellent. We loved the japan rest and also the seafood. Jesus at the seafood resturant was a pleaure to have around we love Lobster and we had it many nights.The beach was beautiful the sand was white and yes the water is blue. WE enjoyed getting a coco loco and watching the sunset over the ocean.As for the evening shows they were fun. I want you all to know that my Husband won the Mr. Majestic contest and yes I had to call him that for the rest of the vacation. He also won the Michael Jackson contest. He was the worst dancer and the only one with gray hair. But we had a blast. you only get out of a vacation what you put into it. We went to have fun not to review a resort.I also want to mention that the doors of the rooms all have deadbolt locks that only can be opened from the inside so you don't have to worry about someone walking in your room if you use it. also Please put your belongings in the safe.-it is easy to use even if you have to open it many times a day. I did leave my watch and ring out and did not have a problem. Also bring lots of Off spray we used it everynight before we went to dinner and never got a bite. It also helps if you bring something to hang on your door-they all look alike and the room numbers our hard to read . Some people had ribbon taped on the door. I must say that in the past we have spent five years going to the riviera maya and have tried the iberostars and other resort and I think that this resort topped them. They waited on us hand and foot And we will be back. Don't have second thoughts about this place just relax and smile and go for the fun. any questions please email me. If I must complain about some thing it is that i had trouble finding those little white tables at the beach. also they could use a couple more drink runners on the beach

<Content>lovely vacation My wife and I went to the Majestic Colonial Hotel on our vacation in January. This was our 4th trip to Dominican Republic and our first time at the Majestic. This hotel is now our favorite as it exceeded all of our expectations. The hotel personnel was very friendly and attentive. The food and drinks were abundant and excellent. The hotel manager (Mr. Gutierrez) was great in helping me organize a romantic dinner on the beach. The pool was awesome - I hear it is the longest in the caribbean. The room was the best I have seen - very spacious, with large jacuzzi bath! At night, we always went to see the shows, or to the casino. Great fun! Highly recommend this place.

<Content>Fantastic! I just returned this week from a 7 day stay with the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. It was an incredible holiday. This resort is very beautiful and accomodating. The staff at the resort were extremely courteous and hard working. They really know how to make sure their guests are having a wonderful time. The Majestic's Animation Team were fabulous. Kiko, Melvin, Pablo, Leo, Yimi, Lina, Kelly, Samuel, and Cesar worked non stop to keep the guests entertained and smiling. This vacation would not have been the same without them. Gracias Team! the Dominican Republic is an excellent destination for a getaway, I have been their twice and wouldn't hestitate to jump on a plane and return.

<Content>Maggie and Maria at the Kids Club are excellent Our family of four (kids 3 and 6) stayed for ten days. The most signficant aspect of the trip was that we were for the first time able to enjoy some adult time without worrying about the health, safety and entertainment of our young children. Thanks to Maggie and Maria at the kids club, which features a water slide and a full day program for young ones (my youngest isn't fully potty-trained), my husband and I were able to enjoy a few days of fun alone together. For those of us double-income working families, we know that vacations can be an exercise merely of moving child care operations from one place to another and the parents are usually more exhausted after the vacation than they were before they left. Not so here. With love and care, these two women provide a supportive and fun environment. The club is open from 10 to 6, which allows parents to take a meaningful break.Other thoughts -- make sure you have cash upon arrival in Punta Cana -- there is a ten dollar per person entrance fee into the country; be sure to have some immodium or mylanta on hand -- the food is tough to handle; give yourself plenty of time to get to the airport -- the process is amazingly inefficient; be sure and get a combination swedish/deep tissue massage from Emilia, Pilar or Dulcividia at the spa --- the service, attention to detail and skill of the masseuses is second only to those in Asia.Overall, a good family resort.

<Content>Paradise FOUND The beach is so wonderful, the room was clean, the staff very nice. The drinks were very good (the wine too), the breakfast was great (my eggs were always good perfectly). The Anamacion Team was great. I had class with Lina for stretching and she is very good. I had Melvin and Kiko for Sand Aerobics. Yimi is such a nice, funny guy who kept the atmosphere happy. I am a picky eater and found the food to be good. Yeah, there are flies around but the food is outside so what do you expect? There could have been better shopping but what can you do, the beach made up for it. It can get a little loud where I was staying (4th floor of bldg 2). I got a tan and enjoyed myself. Thank God the weather was good, otherwise I would have been bored.

<Content>Honeymoon with the children Fantastic We just arrived home from our holidays on Jan 10/08 where we spent one absolutely wonderful week at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. I have been following the reviews from Trip Advisor in regards to the Majestic since August/07 and when I arrived home and was reading the reviews before I posted mine I was absolutely horrified. The person or persons writing these reviews must have gotten their resorts mixed up.We arrived at the Majestic at 4 pm on Jan 3/08 and were greeted by cool, wet cloths and escorts to the front reception. Check in was immediate and handled by Paola who was extremely friendly. We then were given a non alcohlic beverage which was very nice, and as the kids were with us I was very happy that it was without alcohol. We were given 4 towel cards and shown to our room which was ready. They had just set up the two extra beds for our two sons who accompanied us. The jacuzzi was full, with bubbles and floating rose petals. There was also a bottle of champagne waiting for us. A banner was put across the outside of our room door the announced us as  The Honeymooners, we saw other doors that said Happy Anniversary as well. The luggage arrived about 10 minutes after we entered our room. At that time we were told if anything was needed all we had to do was call and we were shown our passport to the hotel that was given to us at check in. The boys, 10 and 12, immediately ran out the patio doors and off into the pool. We had a ground floor room although not a swim up room. We were in Bldg 3 Room 3144 which is at the very end closest to the ocean and right at the beach bar and restaurant. The pool bar was directly in front of us and the Spa was slightly to the left. It was a fair walk to the main hotel and the buffet and a la carte restaurants but it was a pleasant one that was set up quite nicely for wheelchair access as well as wheeled walkers. My new husband was delighted as he had free access to the sushi bar that was set up outside on the way into the main lobby and as you were passing on your way to the main buffet. We have been to the Carribean on many occasions before and basically a buffet is a buffet. This one was done quite well. The boys preferred all there meals there and we went with a different a la carte every evening. Breakfast was always at the Buffet and we looked forward to seeing Felix at the omelette station. He always remembered us and always had a smile and conversation for us. On our last day he even wished my husband good luck on his bet for Dallas on Sunday and for my son to get a goal at his next hockey game. This was a person who was genuinely interested in what his patrons had to say. Cooked an excellent omelette as well.The Gourmet Restaurant was wonderful, we ate there first. The beef was done to perfection.The Mexican Restaurant was everything we expected it to be with a very nice atmosphere.The Rodea Steak House and Grill were my favorite as I am a simple meat and potatoes kind of girl. The Matsuri Restauarant had a very impressive Sushi Bar for appetizers and the Lemon Chicken I would definitely recemmend.LeCaberete was our Romantic dinner for two that was offered to us from the hotel. Normally you don't need reservations for this restaurant but it was a meal that was catered only to us by one waiter. The lamb was very, very good. They made a special menu for us as my husband is allergic to all shell fish and this was the Seafood Restaurant. Beef was served with the lamb and was just as good. Actually, I was surprised at the beef in Punta Cana as it was much better that in Cuba or Mexico, The fresh Ceasar salad made the meal.Twice in our room we came in to find pleasant surprises. I should say 3 times. Once we came back to a wonderful fruit plate, another time was the invitation for the Romantic dinner for two as well as a bridal breakfast brought to our room, which we booked at our convenience. (when the kids had left for the pool)On the day before we left we found a piece of heart shaped cake on a platter that was glazed with peaches and kiwi on it and across the platter was written Happy Honeymoon.I never really met our maid but she did a wonderful job. I left a small gift bag with cosmetics ect. everyday and I am sure the gift bag was just as important as what went into it. We always had 6 large white towels and two yellow beach towels in our room as well as our 4 towel cards. We were given two clean Majestic white robes on a daily basis as well. For the person who filled our mini bar we left a dollar everyday and left notes in simple spanish as to what we wanted. Our requests were met everytime, whether it was for extra water, chocolate for the kids, or a couple extra Presidente. We left a larger tip for them both when we left.The beach was absolutely amazing. I have never been to such a beautiful beach. Although I never noticed whether it was raked or not, I never saw a cigarette or cigar butt anywhere. Every morning when we went the chairs were all back in order and never had a problem finding 4 chairs together under a palapas. The ocean is quite rough but made it all the more fun, the boys loved it. They knew not to go down there without one of us with them because of the danger they could be in from undertow. We were never allowed to get any of the snorkel gear as we were told the water was too rough but we used the boogie boards on many occasions and my guys took advantage of the parasailing offered at the beach( extra $$$) $ 45 for a single of $40 for tandem which is quite reasonable. I realize I am jumping everywhere with this but I have so much to say and I didn't prewrite anything this is it in the rough. The stores in the hotel are very overpriced and we just didnt bother shopping there after a $22 munchie stop the first time. The professional photographers were fantastic . I wanted to get pics done but my husband isn't one to pose. The Punta Blanca shopping mall that you can get to from the hotel can be slightly intimidating at first but get bartering and have fun. The rule of thumb is automatically knock off 75% of there first offer and if they don't come back with the numbers you like, then walk away and you will get your price.We travelled thu West Jet and they were amazing, out tour rep met us at the hotel the next morning and we booked our excursions, were always picked up on time for everytrip and also the trip back to the airport where she made she we got standing in the right line for our luggage ect. Preey painless. I know I am missing a thousand things but please feel free to ask me anything. We originally emailed ahead to the resort and told Richard of our plans and everything was made very special for us

<Content>Definitely not 5 star We arrived at the Majestic Colonial hoping for a relaxing 7 day vacation in a 5 star 2 year old resort. What we got was the worst experience we have had so far in 7 consecutive years of Caribbean vacations.My excited son walked into our musky smelling room and sat on the bed which collapsed. One of the feet had broken off and would have had to be evident to the maid. The bell boy happened to be delivering our luggage at the time and said he would send someone right down to fix our bed (never happened) my husband had to fix it himself by going out into the hallway where another broken bed happened to be outside (I guess common problem) and he was able to take a foot from that bed in order to fix the one in our room. Receptacles were hanging off the wall with live wires exposed. The phone smelled like someone had thrown up on it, which is very likely with the food you are served. Quality of hotel finishes left a lot to be desired and it is hard to believe hotel is only 2 years old!!The beach is beautiful although you have to be careful in the water as it gets deep pretty quick. We never had a problem with chairs at the beach or pool. Pool is also fantastic although the water is very cold. And don鈥檛 try going in after 6pm, my son got scolded for doing so. The layout of this resort is not well planned.Lunch buffet at the beach always the same very little selection especially with fruits and desserts. Need a waiter to order your drinks, no where to be found. Try walking away from your plate and one will jump out of nowhere to grab your plate  cutlery ( they want you out fast).Dinner at the Steakhouse 1st night, Appetizers were forgotten so they were served half way through our meal. 2nd night we were served drinks in plastic cups which I could not understand when all the other guests were served in glass cups. After complaining we were punished by being made to wait for drinks while the waiter walked around looking for something to do. Finally he brought us hot drinks with a cube of ice after we were well into our meal. Dinner at the Japanese Restaurant, Nice presentation of sushi to pick from but I don鈥檛 believe they know how to refrigerate this food properly because I became extremely sick for the next 2 days and my Husband and Sons still have Diahrea to this day.We asked at customer relations desk to dial our Signature Rep so we could verify our pick-up time to the airport. She proceeded to interrogate us as to why we needed to make this call and her conclusion was that we could either wait for our rep to come in later on that afternoon or we could go back to our room and get charged for the call. Unless she saw blood or we had broken bones she was not going to dial any number for us. This conversation lasted about 5min where a simple call would have taken up 1 min of her time and would have pleased a guest. She saved the resort $.50 for the call. With the penny pinching attitude that is so evident at this resort I believe she could get promoted for this deed so I left her name out. Towels are located in an awkward place away from the beach. Careful when returning towels they will try to give you less cards than the towels you returned so you can get charged for them.The entertainment team must come up with new jokes so they do not have to rely on making fun of the Chinese language. We are not Chinese and found this to be extremely insulting. The music, 鈥渋t鈥檚 raining men鈥?will replay all day every day, because they play the same  only cd over and over.Willing to pay for late check out that is advertised, Not possible too many guests arriving that day. Storage room for luggage after we had to give up our room was not secured in any way, anyone could have gotten into our luggage so had to carry around our passports and valuables at the beach. Line ups to take a cold shower in the courtesy rooms and one towel for the 3 of us. Hot water did not run out it just wasn鈥檛 connected.First time I ever took the time from my busy schedule to write a review and although I could go on with the disappointment of this resort I believe I have gotten my point across so that no one else has to be subjected to this kind of treatment.

<Content>Loved the Majestic Colonial We stayed at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana last October for one week. It was a terrific, relaxing week for my husband and I. The Majestic Colonial is all- inclusive -- we enjoyed all the restaurants and bars. The food was very good and plentiful. There is a small casino, small stage shows each night, sports bar and disco.The massages and reflexologists are very good and reasonable. Other vacationers were exceptionally friendly. The one pool winds through the entire hotel. And the beach is nice with plenty of chairs and umbrellas. The rooms are spacious and well appointed -- all being reasonably close to the pool and restaurants.But the one thing that made this trip so pleasurable was the attention and service of the staff -- in particular -- Cristhian and Francisco Paulino. They were the BEST! They are one of the main reasons that we are already planning our return trip.

<Content>Best Hotel Ever!! We went with the kids, and it was great. the animation team made the hotel fun. if it wasnt for them it would be boring. (THE BEAUTIFUL LINA, SAMUEL, KIKO, JIMMY, LEO, CESAR, JONATHAN, MELVIN, AND THE HOST HENRY GIPETO) we loved them. there are shows on the beach and the pool. they try very hard to make you enjoy yourself. this was our 4th time in dominican republic, and we will definitly come back to this resort once more.

<Content>Disappointing Not as good as presented by trip advisor reviewers. Before every trip, I review the comments and ratings provided on this site for my desired destination. The data compiled on this site has proven very accurate in the past. Sure you can get some overly positive or negative reviews but usually you can pick up trends to help you understand what the resort is really like. For the first time, I have found that the information provided by the majority of the reviewers for the Majestic resort does not match what I experienced first hand. Normally, I would not provide my own review because I would only be repeating what had been said by other reviewers. But in this case, I felt it necessary to balance things out a little and perhaps save some other innocent travelers the great feelings of disappointment that my family and I felt during our trip to the Majestic. But then again, if mosquitos, musty smelling water damaged rooms, worn out recreational equipment, dirty fitness room, poorly constructed buildings, unhelpful front desk personnel, noisy outside closet doors, unprofessional night time entertainment, and last but not least food that will probably make you ill is your thing then this is the place to go. If you are lucky, you might get one of the good rooms. They must exist because reviewers have documented how if you complain loud and hard enough they will move you to another better room. Unfortunately, we didn't have such luck.Basic information: Duration of vacation was one week. Starting December 27, 2007 and ending January 3, 2008. The weather was pretty good. Plenty of hot temperatures for water activity and just a little rain on one day. Stayed in room 1337. So, that's building number 1 on the third floor in room 37. It should be noted that there are 4 buildings and for the most part they are only 3 stories high. But in spots there are 4 floors. Our room was in one of the locations were there was another floor above us.First, I will start with positives that are not directly related to the resort. The beach was and is amazing. Also the water is pretty rough. I like that because I find it fun to frolic in the waves. So did my son. However, this can be viewed as negative for families with young children. It can be very dangerous. Two adults drowned on December 28th. So you have to be careful. This occurred off the beach at the Excellence. For the record, the Excellence is quite a distance north of the Majestic. The water was rough as far as I could walk in both north and south directions.I enjoy walking the beach. I walked both north for an hour on one day and south for an hour another day and in both cases never reached the end of the beach. This leads to the next group of positives, items directly related to the resort. Location. I liked where the resort was located. To the south there is resort after resort and to the north you can walk on the beach where they are a couple of resorts then new a giant resort that's under construction and eventually parts where there are no resorts at all. Just wild beach with all sorts of garbage laying around. I counted two refrigerators a basketball and hundreds of plastic bottles. I liked the beach but not the garbage. I can't blame the Majestic for that however.Lobby is very attractive. The grounds at the Majestic are very nicely landscaped. The pool is large and it is worked into the grounds in a way that is very appealing. Generally, the grounds are kept pretty clean. I was happy with the cleaning staff with regards to daily maid service. We were there for New Year's and the fireworks display was good. Also, the New Year's buffet was well done.I can't speak about all the rooms but the variant that we had was very spacious and most everything worked as it should. No blocked drains, broken toilets, leaky taps, etc. as reported in other reviews. Oops, sorry there was a problem with the balcony door not always closing and locking properly. Note: Air Conditioner is designed to only operate when door is closed and locked. Our room had a partial ocean view and it was no where near the construction site.Now for the negatives. The room was the biggest disappointment. Stinky. Very musty smelling. Obvious water damage to ceiling and arch over the Jacuzzi. Once upon a time, water from the 4th floor unit above must have leaked down and the resulting damage was never fixed. Another interesting initial observation upon entering the room was that there were many squashed mosquitos on the ceiling and various walls. My wife had asked for a (cot) for our son, in the event we could not get 2 double beds. As it turned out the room did have 2 double beds but the resort gave us the cot anyway. We did not need nor use the cot. The cot is actually a single mattress and box spring. The set in our room was dirty and ragged. Considering it's condition, I would have had a difficult time using it. As stated in the positives, the room was big and had a desk and chair as well as a sofa. The chair was was stained and dirty. The sofa was blocked by the cot and we never used it. For the record, it looked in need of replacing and I saw them bringing in new ones but we never got one. At night, there was a constant banging noise. I eventually tracked down the cause and fixed it. There are utility closets in the hallway that the maids use and I guess some closets provide access to pipes and wires. At night, it is very windy causing the closet doors to bang loudly. I saw down the hall that someone else had stuck a folded up napkin into the space between the closet door and the frame. I did the same for the closets near our room and this solved the problem until someone needed to open the closets. I had to do it a couple of times throughout the week. Even though we arrived very late, after seeing and smelling the room, we asked to change rooms. We were given the old line that it was impossible because the place was full. The person at the front desk suggested that we try again in the morning. The next morning our request was again deferred. Try again later in the afternoon was the response. I know we should have kept complaining but I don't go on vacation to have to constantly complain to get acceptable accommodations. We decided to make the best of it. I honestly picked this place because I incorrectly believed things would be at a very high standard thus avoiding the need to complain. However, this is not the case. So beware, management at this resort does not mind putting it's reputation at risk by sticking customers in rotten rooms. If you go to this resort and things are not to your liking, you will have to complain and complain loudly to get something decent. If you do not enjoy complaining, well I suggest picking a different place.The first morning is also when we realized that during the night we were mosquito bait. I didn't know that I was bitten until I noticed a smear of blood on the bed sheet. For the rest of the trip, we spent countless hours before bed trying to kill all the mosquitos in the room. This happened every night. While my son thought this was an exciting adventure because it allowed him to stay up past his bedtime, I however, did not enjoy the experience. Of course we always managed to miss one or two so we would wake up with bites. Just for the record, this island has mosquitos that carry the malaria parasite. I don't believe they currently have active cases in Punta Cana but they did a couple of years ago. According the CDC, they do have active cases in Haiti and in other parts of the Dominican. Getting bit by mosquitos is never a good idea. But in the Dominican it is especially dangerous. Fogging at the resort occurred every day we were there except one. They started like clock work right under our balcony window at 6:00 p.m.. I'm not sure how the mosquitos got into our room but my theory is that they came in when the cleaning lady had the doors open. One day, I was in the room in the afternoon and I notice quite a few mosquito trying to get in through the balcony door. There must have been a dozen or so. This is midday. I've been to Mexico and other Caribbean islands and I never encountered a problem like this. I've seen mosquitos but not in the rooms and not during the day. During midday, I also encountered mosquitos in the men's washroom by the theatre and in the fitness room. Not good.I worked out in the fitness room 3 times during my stay. The fitness room is found in the games club area and it is not kept clean. Besides the mosquitos, there were many flies and the floors in general look as though they are rarely cleaned. I only saw cleaning staff in there once during the week and they were cleaning the windows. I bet the equipment is never properly wiped down. When in the fitness room, I would wash my hands as often as possible. To do this, you have to go into the washroom. All main washroom doors in the resort are always kept open. So all the bugs were in there too. The equipment is average and in not too bad of shape. The one free weight bar that existed in the place was bent and one of the collars was broken. Really, compared to the rest of the equipment in the games club this was as good as it gets.The other equipment in the games club was in pretty bad shape. The pool tables were in need of a good cleaning. The one ping pong table could only be describe as dilapidated. For part of the week, one of the ping pong paddles was being held together with scotch tape. The fuse ball table was also ready for the dumpster.I like to play tennis but after playing once on the one regulation size hard court, I decided it was better if I didn't. The surface was peeling away. There were bits and pieces scattered all over the court. It was dangerous to play on. The tennis area in general was very disappointing. Besides the bad condition of the one regulation sized hard court, the other multi-use court was strewn with concrete block debris. The one clay court or at least what passes for a clay court in the Dominican was in need of some serious attention as well. There were no facilities near the court. No water available. No washrooms. To get to the courts, you have to walk across a bridge that crosses the swamp. The railings on the bridge were falling off. One day a work crew began tearing off all the railings. I imagine that they were going to install new railings but it didn't happen while I was there. Archery was advertised as being available. But when I inquired about it, I was told that the one bow they had was broken.Reviewers constantly stated in past reviews that finding empty chairs on the beach and around the pool was not a problem. I did not find this to be the case. We still had to play the get down to the beach early game or we would not be able to find chairs in the shade. Same with the pool. One cause of the problem on the beach was the fact that about 10 of the shade structures were missing their palm leaves. It wasn't until the last day that I noticed workers installing the palms in some. I also noticed many discarded cigarette butts in the sand from the previous day. It didn't look like they do much in the way of a clean up. For example, I didn't see any rake marks. Other resorts that I've been to rake the entire beach overnight.I noticed some large crack in the exterior walls in both buildings 1 and 2. I don't know if they compromise the building's integrity but it sure didn't look right. Hurricane damage? Don't know but in my opinion it might be due to poor building standards.Our return flight was at 8:00 p.m. so we requested a late checkout. The person at the front desk said it was impossible. My wife tracked down Victor. I guess Victor is the guy. He granted our request. It is unacceptable that the other front desk staff are told to only say not possible. Again it appears not to matter to management if guests are needlessly disappointed. Another example of poor management is their little passport book directs clients to call a special number to make restaurant reservations. When we called the number the person on the other end informed us that we have to go in person to the restaurant to make reservations.The night time entertainment. Don't waste your time. Very unprofessional. Embarrassingly so. Hard to watch. One show the audio system kept kicking out and the lip-synchers just kept lip-synching. Without music. Very funny for the kids. For those that were still up. The show doesn't start until 10:00 p.m.Last but not least, the food. The unfortunate part about this is we did get some decent food. But we also got some terrible food. Quality is very inconsistent. Breakfast is the worst. If you don't mind standing in line for an omelette(breakfast) or pasta(lunch), you should get something edible. Most of the breakfast and lunch buffet food that is suppose to be hot is not. The food is left out too long without replacing it. I'm use to hot dishes being put on steam tables or under heat lamps to keep it warm. But they are not always doing this. The orange juice tastes like grape fruit juice. The pineapple and lemonade beverages were sickly sweet. The breakfast fruit selection is very limited. In general, the popular stations are poorly located and/or understaffed. The pasta bar down at the beach buffet is setup so the line of people for it blocks access to a main part of the steam table. Also at the beach buffet, my family and I noticed ants crawling all over a tray of cookies. I watched the situation for the duration of my lunch to see if any staff would notice. I warned guests that were about to take cookies from the tray. Unfortunately, not one staff member noticed. My last negative about the food involves how food is stored at the Japanese restaurant. Before cooking the food, (chicken, beef, shrimp), it is sitting in containers with no refrigeration. For example, they don't use the whole container of shrimp for a sitting. So the next sitting will use what is left. This means that the meat and seafood is sitting there for extended periods without refrigeration. To make matters worse, I don't know how long it had been out prior to our sitting. The containers had no condensation on them to indicate that they had at least come from a refrigerator.Besides our disappointment with the resort itself, I must mention that the tour company that we booked with added to the disappointment. We booked with Nolitours which promotes the added advantages of being part of the Cameleon Gold Club. Nolitours advertises a list of additional services available to their customers. Several of the services were either missing in action or just the normal services that all guests received. We did not get a welcome drink, a welcome letter, a preferred room location (unless of course the mosquitos make the room a preferred location), or preferred reservations for the restaurants. As a matter of fact, when we tried make a reservation at the Japanese restaurant, we were told the first opening was after we were due to leave. My wife indicated that this was not acceptable and again after complaining we were accommodated. It is not totally clear what some of these additional services are suppose to provide. For example, concierge service. Other services seem to be just the norm for all the guests at the resort. For example, the Mini-bar being stocked daily with water, beer, soft drinks and snacks. A misrepresentation in my opinion. To top off the poor service from the tour company, we had paid for transfer between the resort and the airport. On our last day, the tour representative told us that the bus to the airport would leave the resort at 4:15 p.m. sharp. We were in the lobby a 3:50 p.m.. At 4:30 p.m. my wife had to negotiate with the Sunquest people to get us on their bus. We never did see the Nolitours bus.As I stated at the beginning, I'm writing this because my experience didn't match what other reviewers had been writing. If I would have known about these conditions in advance, I would not have gone to the Majestic. Since my return, I have notice reviews more in line with what I experienced. I totally concur with the review written by drpdd on Jan. 01, 2008. I suspect the overly positive reviews must be written by individuals with vested interests or the standards mysteriously dropped during one of the busiest times of the year. A time when you would expect management to try and make the best impression possible. They certainly made an impression.

<Content>Great Vacation! My wife and I clebrated our 30th anniversary at the Majestic Colonial Dec. 29th thru Jan.5th. We went there to totally relax and had no special agenda of any extra trips or excursions. We found our room to be very nice (2241) which over looked the swim up bar and main entertainment area at the pool. It was very close to the beach and also very close to a bridge that took you to the other side of the pool and bars. I highly recommend to get into buidling 2 or 3 because 1 and 4 have the balconies facing out at adjacent properties one being under construction(not very good views). We found the food more than adequate with the Mexican restaurant (fajetas) being my favorite. If you went hungry it was your own fault. The steak house was very good and the main buffet always had a very good selection. The alcohol was plentiful if that is what you wanted with the most beautiful pool we had ever seen. The beach was also very clean and nice and relaxing. Victor the bartender at the swim up bar was very nice and always very accomodating. There were always people sweeping and cleaning. The language issue is not that big a deal as we had very little trouble communicating. Over all we really enjoyed our trip and would recommend this very highly.

<Content>Fermin is the best My wife and our best friends went to Majestic Colonial two weeks ago. I cannot say but good things of this resort.Ours rooms were in building 4 in front of the construction and we did not care, as we didn鈥檛 pay for being sat down in a balcony a whole week, we planned our schedule of activities several months of anticipation. !!!!!We went to Saona Island is great. The Marinarium is a must seen.When at the beach, make sure you to get in contact with Fermin, he is the nicest person, we asked him how many dirty monkey could you bring us, he said: as much as you can drink, anything is possible in paradise, also he speaks very good English.We do not usually travel to the same destination, but if we go back to Dominican Republic certainly will be to Majestic Punta Cana.

<Content>Fantastic Christmas Getaway!! We spent 2 weeks over Christmas this year in Punta Cana and loved the Majestic Colonial! The beach was impeccable, the food above-average for an all-inclusive resort ,and the staff smiling and helpful (particularly if you made an effort to speak Spanish!). Our teenage girls loved the activities - we felt thoroughly relaxed after 2 weeks. The only suggestions for the hotel would be: 1) replace all the pillows!! and 2) reduce the noise level of the animation - not everyone needs or wants to hear about the games being played. For transfers to and from the airport: don't get caught by the baggage game. When you arrive move quickly through all the porters blocking the exit; they don't ask permission before they grab your bags. And be careful when leaving the country: I'm sure their baggage scales are a few kilo's out of whack - almost everyone on our tour was asked to pay for excess baggage. I had packed very carefully and knew we weren't over - when i made a fuss about it they let me go without paying.

<Content>Loved the Majestic We stayed at the Majestic from December 23rd until January 6th, 2008, overall we had a fantastic time and would recommend the resort.The resort and gardens are well maintained and staff are always doing something - be it in the garden or painting walls of the facility - they are always busy!! There were three of us on this trip, my husband and I and our 16 year old son. None of us got sick during our stay at the resort and found the food pretty good and our complaint was that we ate way too much and after two weeks were a little bored but we would have been at any hotel!!! Christmas Eve dinner and New Years Eve dinner were both wonderful. We had lots of fun and found the staff friendly and most of them spoke English. The staff who could not speak English very well were always happy and polite. I think ones personal attitude towards others commands the respect you get!!! No complaints there. Tipping was not a pre-requsite for good service either.The animation team do a good job of creating a good atmosphere and gave us many hours of laughter especially with the dancing lessons.The pools and beach are lovely. Not too much trouble with mosquitoes - though we did notice that they sprayed every night - not sure if it was for mosquitoes though? Of course there are flies and ants - it doesn't mean things are dirty - we are plagued by flies, mosquitoes and ants where I live and we are certainly not dirty.Remember you are in a third world country and their 5 star service is certainly not what you would get in the States or Europe. But all in all a wonderful experience. Would I return, absolutely.

<Content>Great vacation We just returned from a wonderful week at the majestic colonial resort. The weather was gorgeous and the beach was amazing. There was a large pool with a great swim up bar. There were plenty of lounge chairs at the pool and the beach. The kids club was great. Magie and Maria took wonderful care of my three yr old son who willingly spend a few hours with them each day. My husband and I were happy to know that he was being well taken care of and that he was having such a lot of fun. We liked the Japanese and Chinese restaurants. If you like fish the selection of fish at the restaurants is good. The buffet breakfast was top notch - we enjoyed the fresh crepes and egg stations every day. My son loved the food too. The room was large and clean. My only fault was the large number of mosquitos - the maids leave the room open when cleaning and the mosquitoes get into the rooms. We did not see all the shows - enjoyed some of the musicals and the live band. I would highly recommend this resort

<Content>Not #2 in Punta cana--really! We have been to this part of Dom Rep for several times and this review is going to be a short one.Compared to most of the resorts we have stayed in before,this one's food is only O.K but I don't think it's very clean because this is the only time that I was sick and many people I talked to all had bad stomach that lasted for at least a few days,myself was bad for about a week.The beach and the pool and the room are the only good qualities of this hotel,entertainment was bad(especially the guys on the stage are so NOT funny it's embarrassing,dancers are ok and Michael J was the only good show).Some staff were very friendly but many were just moody,as I have said before we have been to this country many times,we do understand that the language is a problem but we never minded because the people have always been so nice in this country and a smile says more than a thousand words but I have to say that the staff in this hotel do need to work on the smile bit..I am very suprised that this resort came on the top of the rank in Punta Cana as that was the only reason for me to book it at the first place,after have been staying there I really have to say it doesn't deserve the title,Iberostar Bavaro was far better in so many ways.And we will not be going back there unless there is a significant improvement.

<Content>warning...rushed to hospital. I'm not going to bore you with the little issues we had in our trip. and so I will get straight to the point. We went down Dec 29/08 for 7 days, if you look at the date of this review you can tell we only made it for four days and we are now back in Canada. This was our 3rd trip to DR. This hotel is beautiful, the beaches are spectacular and the rooms not too bad. Everyone knows that at a resort in the DR the waitstaff can be trying and the language barrier issue pops up often, but it's tolerated after all we're on vacation. WARNING- This same level of sub standard service continues into their hospitals. After two days my wife became so violently ill from the food at this resort she was rushed to a local (private) hospital. She (and I) spent two days in this hosptial. After she was admitted i was told to go back to the resort and leave her (no way). I spent two days on a wooden chair in a hallway as I was not aloud into the room...my wife was so de-hydrated from the illness that an I.V. line was in her arm. She took 4 litres in the end over the two days. They tried to give her anti-biotic, but my wife is five months pregnant and studies over here have conclusive evidence that antibiotics should not be administered during as pregnancy. This hospital tried to give her antibiotics and when my wife asked what it was they were trying to give her, the nurse didn't know. She told my wife to take the pills and a needle because the doctor says she had to and she must do what the doctor said. My wife refused and the nurse threw the products against a wall and walked out. After that we never saw a doctor again. Just a nurse who changed the saline. I could go on and on about the no soap or no toilet seats and the ants running around in the washrooms, no pillows or blankets on the beds in the rooms etc etc, but I won't horrify you.All I am saying is that if you get in any trouble in a third world country it can be a very very scary time and you are isolated and most certainly at their mercy. There are plenty of other countries to see.We managed by the grace of god to catch a flight out, but it cost us $800. When I checked out of this hotel (three days early), i explained why...the employee just shrugged his shoulders with no apology or concen and then handed me my spa bill.If you don't take heed to this warning be sure to do the following prior to you leaving...1- contact your private (work) insurer to let them know where you are going prior to departure and get all the necessary phone numbers to contact them in case of emergency.2-make sure you call your cellular carrier and have them place you on their roaming feature so you can use your cell while down there otherwise you phone may not work.3-do not trust the hosptial workers down there, if you feel something is wrong...stop them and don't give in. This country is trying, but they are no where close to our level of healthcare and there lack of education on healthcare matters is evident.I had done the above things and it made things easier, but i think we had some luck on our side too.We have been to DR three times...i guess our luck ran out this time, because you're lucky if you don't get sick. We will vacation in a first world country form now own it's just not worth the risk to our health.

<Content>Fantastic holiday My wife and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial in October 2007. Overall, we had a wonderful stay.Emily (on the front desk) was fantastic. She allocated us a great room in building 2 on the top floor with great views including a partial ocean view.During our stay, all staff members were very polite and helpful at all times. We left our cleaner a small daily tip which she appreciated very much. We also left her a daily note (which the front desk translated into Spanish for us) which thanked her for her hard work.Our minibar was not stocked daily (as advertised) but we easily managed to get drinks elsewhere and bring them back to the room if required.The room was magnificent and well sized. The bathroom was not at all private, but for my wife and I this didn't matter. The lack of privacy would not suit everyone.Some people complained about the mattresses being hard but we found it fine. Yes the pillows are shallow but they have more pillows available in the cupboard.We had mixed feelings about the food, as follows:The best was the gourmet (French). The soup and steak were both fantastic.The steak grill at the beach was also excellent.The breakfast buffet was extremely good - lots of variety.The seafood restaurant was great.The mexican was good.The Japanese (with reservation) was quite good but our cook lacked any charisma, and forgot to provide a started.However, the main buffet wasn't so good. ALL the food was just warm whether it was supposed to be a cold plate or a hot meal. Even the ice cream was often more like cream!!The late night fast-food place served food that went straight into the rubbish bin.One reason we booked this hotel was because our brochure said unlimited use of non-motorized water sports including sailing and kayak. This wasn't true as you are limited to an hour per person per day which means that we could not have visited the shipwreck (about an hour's kayak from the hotel) as we had hoped. So we asked instead about sailing and they said that they only had catamarans and you needed experience to be able to hire one. So we eventually settled with hiring a kayak for an hour - but was told that the water was too rough. Too rough? I have kayaked down white water rivers and the sea was calm! I asked what they meant by this, and was told that the underwater currents would knock me over when I got into and out of the boat. So I checked the sea and was able to stand perfectly without feeling any currents. Each time we tried to hire a kayak, we were told that the sea was too rough. Unfortunately, we never got to use any of the water activities which we were disappointed with.The swimming pool is phenomenal in terms of its size and cleanliness. There is a wall dividing the pool effectively into two, so you have to get out at one point if you want to swim the entire length. It was a little disappointing that everyone was asked to leave the pool at around 6.30pm. After this time, there was very little to do other than eat or watch television.The games area was not too bad. The pool tables were in a horrible condition but then 2 new tables were delivered during our stay which were a delight to use. The table-tennis table was very hard to play on given its poor condition. The tennis courts were flooded (from rain) most days so we were unable to make use of that.The worst point of the entire holiday was our tour rep (obviously nothing to do with the hotel) but she is worth a mention. Emma, the job is not for you!The internet shop was useful but the connection kept breaking. Sometimes it would be down for days. You pay for 30 / 60 minutes in advance and were charged even while the connection was down. We tried politely to get a refund but were refused. However, when the connection was back up and running, it was a useful facility.If you leave the hotel and explore the local shopping areas, you will get very very harassed by the local sellers. A polite no thank you seemed to work in most cases. If you want to buy something, then prices will start off incredibly high. For example, a shop keeper wanted 200 USD for a small bottle of sunblock. We eventually got this down to around 12 USD.The beach and sea were amazing. The sand was white and litter free (in fact there was always a staff member picking up any litter). The sea was warm and although we were warned of strong currents, we never experienced a problem.We loved the hotel and staff. I would suggest that the 5 star rating would be comparable to a good 3 or 4 star in Europe or North America. If you go with a slightly lower expectation, then things can only be brilliant!This is a third world country and it's worth remembering that before you complain to the hotel about every little issue. My wife and I noticed many people ruining their own holidays by complaining bitterly about stupid things! Just relax and enjoy the holiday!

<Content>The best choice!! We just got back from Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. What a fabulous choice. When you get to the airport I highly recommend you take a taxi even if you have already a transfer set with your agency, is much better and you arrive directly to the hotel in a half an hour. When you get to the main lobby it is breathtaking rose marvel all over. The bellboys welcome you with a smile and a refreshing towel what a start. The majestic drink is very good but I went straight to the bar and had a Presidente!!! The food is great, the breakfast in the main buffet is my favorite one. For dinner try le gourmet as I went 2 times to the Rodeo Grill and two times to the seafood one, those are the best option for dinner and the fastest service. The best service is at the beach; they have a staff of beach concierge who work hard to please everyone. Look for Fermin he is the go to guy, for drinks, towels and information. Definitely I will recommend Majestic to all my friends and the choice couldn't be better.

<Content>third time disappointing We are a couple from Europe, The Netherlands,and we stayed in Majestic Colonial for three times. April 2006, May 2007, and 24 November 2007 until 6 December 2007.Our first two times were excellent, but during our last stay in November we have some remarks.We especially choose this hotel for the third time, because of the very nice and HOT swimming pool. But now the pool was freezing cold compared with our first times. Before you can spend ours in the pool, and also in the pool jacuzzi's,and it was delicious to have relaxing drinks at the swim up bar. We asked reception, guest relation, animation, why the heating was no longer working, but nobody can answer our question.It spoiled our holiday for a big part.Also we noticed that quality of the food, especially the chateu- briand was not as tender as we are used to. And it was not once, because we tried it for several evenings.Sometimes it was also almost cold.We also being irritated that thinks in the rooms, lobby and so which are broken , they were not repaired anymore.Comparing our last stay with the others before ,our opinion is that this hotel must beware for keeping there five star service.After all,when you have plans to go to this hotel, please go, you will certainly have a pleasant time.

<Content>Great Staff. Hello all. I stayed at the Colonial Majestic for about a week with family as a Christmas present from my grandparents. Personally I like to leave the resort and the tours to see real culture and real people, and I find the interaction with people to be my favorite part of any trip. I found the locals that worked there, Jimmy and the Animation team, to be very helpful, informative, and enthusiastic. I even learned a bit of Spanish. They made the holiday very enjoyable and livened up the entire scene. Sincerely, Lenny

<Content>Majestic was majestic once again... My husband and I stayed at the Majestic in May for two weeks on our honeymoon. We absolutely loved it and returned in December. The hotel is top notch. Very clean. Super friendly staff. We were repeaters and asked for a different room and ended up with an ocean view! Heavenly!The food here is amazing. Lots of variety. We noticed that the Gourmet restaurant really vamped up their menu and enjoyed it much more this time around. Fantastic!Shows are still the same. Not very entertaining. The only good show was the Michael Jackson one. Saw it three times and never got tired of it! Pool and beach are amazing and clean. However, the beach has many more huts now than it did back in May. It's much busier with less room to move around. This was a disappointment. We enjoyed how there was lots of beach space back in May. But the sand and water was majestic, none the less.If you have the chance to meet Denny (gets you drinks and towels on the beach), Elena (Matsuri waitress, but formally of the buffet), Cristhian, or a tall friendly waitor at the buffet who always says what's up, or the taller man who distributes towels, you're lucky! They were the most friendly and smiled all the time. They're also very attentive. Thanks to them for remembering us and making our second stay just as great. Treat employees well and they will do the same. Most live in the off-site work camp and only see their families after 12 or 24 days of work. They work hard to make ends meet while we're their enjoying ourselves. Yet, they're always eagar to meet and serve you.Overall, this resort is definitely a 5 star. It has strayed from being mostly couples to families, but is perfect for all ages! Not as exclusive as it used to be...But we anticiapte visiting again in the future.

<Content>Perfect Week at a Perfect Resort My husband and I stayed for 7 nights at the Majestic back in May. It was an amazing hotel and we had a wonderful time. Overall, we would highly recommend this exact hotel if you are planning to travel to Punta Cana due to our positive experience there. There was a lot to do and something for everyone. Food:The food was fine, we always found something we liked and would eat. We ate at all of the restaurants and liked the food at most of them. We weren't too fond of the places down on the beach (the grill and seafood place), but we ate it. In the end of the week, we were going to the buffet for every meal since it was faster and we had tried all of the other restaurants. We do recommend making reservations the first day you get there to make sure you can get a seat at each restaurant during your stay. We brought a bunch of $1's to leave small tips everywhere we went...this meant much faster service, especially for the bar and drinks.Room:THe room was great...very nice! We liked it. Had a mini bar which they'd stock with water and beer, we left good tips every day to get more bottles of water. Toilet wasn't too private if you are traveling with friends I could see this being a bit strange.Beach:Beautiful, we loved it. The little huts were perfect for the hottest afternoon hours when the sun was too intense. We walked several miles down the beach and agreed that we had the best set up at the Majestic with the chairs and the huts to stay out of the sun if it got too hot. We loved reading in the shade.Pool:Huge and awesome! One portion of it was actually warmer water than the other portion of it (it was split into 2 pools). The swim up bar was fun too!! We loved the Majestic with dark rum!! So fun!Bars:Several bars throughout the complex. Friendly staff and they got your drinks faster if you tipped a buck or two.Spa:Looked really nice, but we didn't get any treatments.Entertainment:They had an awesome entertainment crew. Although we mostly sat out and didn't participate since we needed relaxation and to do nothing, we could see that many people had so much fun! They were so friendly and we did participate in a few things...so nice and so fun!!Other:Workout facility was small and sufficient for a basic workout. I actuallyl preferred running on teh outdoor path since it was so beautiful...if you can stand the heat, I recommend that!Hmmm...what else? Overall, if you are going to PC...STAY AT THE MAJESTIC!!!! :)

<Content>Great Experience! Just returned from a wonderful 9 days at the majestic. first time in DR and would return there in a heartbeat and absolutely stay at the majestic. The service was excellent, especially the service at the beach where they have a beach concierge, Denny, who takes care of all your needs (fresh towels, drinks, etc.) with a smile! The staff was extremely friendly and hard working. They really made christmas eve special and the animation team was a blast!!!Couldnt ask for much more from a resort!

<Content>Lower your expectations if you want to enjoy this resort This is a very difficult review for me to write - my aim here is solely to help those thinking about staying at this resort, in specific, or in Punta Cana, in general, make an informed decision and, hopefully, have a more pleasant experience. (my apologies in advance for any grammar/typos)Summary: If you are absolutely set on visiting Punta Cana, the Majestic Colonial is not a bad place to say as long as you lower your expectations - Specifically, you will not be dissapointed if you expect a 2-star start hotel. You will be fairly dissapointed if you expect a 3-star resort. And, you will be extremely dissapointed if you're expecting a stay in a 4-star or better resort.Lastly, I DO NOT RECOMMEND you book your stay through an agency unless you receive a significantly lower price than what you would receive through the resort directly. More on this below.I assure you, this is a review from a real person with extensive travel experience. Feel free to contact me by email if you have any questions or are looking for additional helpful tips.The specifics: I stayed at the Majestic Colonial with my wife and 8 yr old daughter from December 13th through December 24th, 2007.We chose this resort based on reviews we read here. Initially, my wife was concerned about some of the mixed reviews we read about the resort. We chose to dismiss some of the negative reviews since no resort can please everyone and since we had stayed at other all-inclusives in the past and felt our expectations were more realistic. Punta Cana: Before you consider this resort town as your destination, I strongly recommend you do some research (you can get a free and extremely helpful tourist guide to Punta Cana by sending a request to cpt@codetel.net.do). Punta Cana is a somewhat remote resort community - it is located in a very rural area that's 3 hours away from the capital city of Santo Domingo and 1 hour away from the closest thing to resemble a rural city. The color of the water there is magnificent, the sand is among the nicest you'll find in the carribean. The superlatives stop here - it's that simple. Overall, my impression of this community is that is it still trying to define itself and still learning how to present a professional experience for the seasoned tourist. Though everyone is eager to help and tries to be friendly, it is difficult to find the knowledgeable and experienced help that you'd expect to find in a supposedly major tourist destination. We consistenly heard from guests at various resorts that the overall service level and food quality at Puerto Plata, Dominica Republic is vastly superior, although the beaches are not as nice. Similarly, having stayed at the Riviera Maya and and Cabo San Lucas ourselves, we found the overall service levels to be much superior. (I am openly very biased in favor of the Mayan Riviera - there's simply considerably more to do there, the resorts are MUCH better, service levels are superior, and the beach and water there are heavenly as well.Our view of the Punta Cana resorts was confirmed by several fellow tourists who we met while at various excursions. Most had stayed at the other upscale resorts in the area (iberostar, bahia prinicipe, riu, etc.) To a tee, they all confirmed that their stay was not up to par. Furthermore, we had several locals (taxi drivers, exursion coordinator who told us the Majestic was the best or second best resort in the area. I would come back to Punta Cana again, but I would probably wait at least 3 years to give the area a chance to grow and find itself. Making our reservation: We booked our stay through Cheapcarribean.com. In the past, we always booked directly through the resort/airline/car rantal company etc. We went through cheapcarribean because the resort was sold out of units and cheapcarribean had apparently blocked some rooms . In hindsight, this was a mistake. Cheapcarribean, as do most agencies, have very strict cancellation fees. At most, you can expect to get a credit, not a refund, toward future travel thru that agency. Compare that to booking directly with a hotel where usually you do not get charged if you cancel up to 24 hours in advance. In this case, we were very dissapointed with the resort after our first few days of stay. Had we booked directly through the hotel, we would've simply found another hotel without any financial obligation. Because we had already paid the full fee to cheapcarribean, we did not have that luxury. Getting to the resort: The Punta Cana airport was quaint in a nice way - it is a small airport and it was built to exude carribean style with tatch roofs and open ceilings. At the airport, you will be mobbed by workers who want to help you with your luggage. I recommend you get one of them to help for a few $. The airport is small, but, it is not necessarily well marked. We had purchased transfers directly thru cheapcarribean, but did not have a clear idea where to catch the shuttle.  The resort: With the reviews we read, and having stayed at other all inclusives (the Riu Palace Cabo San Lucas and Cancun, the Iberostar Maya and Barcelo Maya both in the Mayan Riviera Mexico) we expected and paid for ($580/night on average) a four star or better resort. We also expected a mega-resort comparable to those found in the 4-star category in the Mayan Riviera. To say the least, we were disappointed based on this expectation. (initially, we thought our stay may be better at one of the many adjacent truly mega-resorts - but, as we found out later, this was supposedly one of the top resorts in the area.When staying abroad, I tend to be fairly forgiving in many areas. I know the employees generally work very hard to please everyone. I know the cooks generally try to make the cleanest best food they can. I know management generally try to motivate their people as best as possible. When it comes to the safety of my family, I am not as forgiving. This resort had several areas that were of extreme concern to me:Safety: none of the roomc had peep holes or safety chains. Throughout our stay, we would hear someone knocking at our door and we were not able to safely make sure it was ok to open the door. The hotel saw it fit to have maintenance and maid service people knock on our door as late as 10:30pm. One night, we even had someone knock at our door around 3am in the morning. we did not open the door then obviously. I was appalled by the hotel's lack of courtesy to afford these standard and inexpensive safety features to their guests.Sanitation: Again, this is resort serving thousands of guests and you cannot expect hospital grade sanitation. However, I found general sanitation here unacceptable. Flies and bugs crawling on open food bars - especially the buffet/retaurant facility close to the ocean. Salads and cold foods served without ice or refrigiration (there would be ice around the food when it was first served. But the ice would not be replenished after it melts. not did the equipment supply any refrigiration) Before I would touch any uncooked items (fruits, salads, etc) I would bring my hand close to the food to check for temperature and, without exception, everything was always room temperature. Needless to say, I stopped consuming all salad bar, butter, milk etc period. Even with that, I constantly experienced mild pain in my stomach. (again, I had never had any symptoms throughout travel in Mexico and the Carribean) Water: you cannot drink water from the tap here -nor use it to brush your teeth. You'll have to use bottled water for that. (yes, Mexico has a similar problem, but four star resorts there filter their water for you.)Privacy: Ok, get this, all doors to public restrooms are always kept open. To the life of me, I just didn't get this. I closed the doors behind me several times when using the men's room, and someone would re-open the door. I know this cannot be a cultural thing.... (my wife and I theorized this must have to do with ventilation/HVAC - but were not sure). Though men/women could maintain a decent amount of privacy in most public restrooms, there were some were that was impossible. The urinal would be facing an open door ---- I am sorry, but I found this simply unacceptable.When we arrived, we were greeted with a gentleman who offered cold towel service and another waitress offering the Majestic special non-alcoholic cocktail. The lobby was beautifully appointed and was up to par with our expectations. We took the gestures to be a good omen for a pleasant stay. Boy, were were we wrong. The resort was build about two years ago. To best summarize the situation there, I believe the resort was built with very poor finish quality (open tiles, no mouldings on many doors, gaps in ceilings) the fit an finish in many areas is simply unacceptable for a 3 or 4 star resort. To compound things, it appears the resort may be operating on a shoe-string budget. Many of the repairs, if any, are done poorly. There is a general lack of PROFESSIONAL maintenane (you'll see a lot of people doing bits and pieces here and there - but they do not appear to be highly qualified) As a result, the resort facilities look considerable older than its age.Some find this resort to be huge. In my experience, I would call this a fairly small mega resort. It is considerably smaller than other all-inclusives in the area (the Gran Bahia Principe, Riu, and Iberostar next door are considerably bigger). There is also an overall lack of generosity at this resort. It is difficult to not sound like a spoiled american tourist here for I truly believe we are blessed to even have this opportunity to vacation) I just found it hard to fathom some of the offerings here. For example, the rooms do not have a pen and paper available. When we contacted guest services to request them, they said they do not offer such amenities to guests. None of the telephones in your room are marked - your only option is to press 0 for an operator. In all other resorts we stayed, we received a bottle of champagne and a basket full of fruits or crakers or something, here, we did not receive such a basket. In other resorts, you get 3 - 4 choices of hard liquor in your room, in addition to beer and soft drinks - here you get 2 bottles of beer per day and three bottles of carbonated drinks. Each day, you receive 4 bottles of water to your room (we tipped our waterperson everyday and received 8). One day, we did not receive any water. When we called to request water, we were told we get one bottle per person - that's three 16 oz bottles for three people to drink all day and rinse garggle etc... I had to call a supervisor at Guest Service and angrily point out that they could spare an extra 75cents of water for a guest staying for eleven days in suite at $580 per day. She promptly called someone to get four bottles instead of three :) sweetness. And they tell you you're supposed to drink 64oz of water per person per day to stay health. Their book library (books you can borrow while staying at the resort) consisted of about 30 English books. There were two ping pong tables in the entire resort. One was so delapidated, it reminded me of the makeshift table that was set up on LOST. There was one giant chess area and the pieces were broken and fractured. Guests have a choice of two games boards (Risk and chess). The workout facility was filthy and the floors were made of concrete with no padding or areas to stretch. The spa space was somewhat of a joke and only allowed you to use the space if you booked treatment. yet, many guests sneeked through the back swimming pool so they can enjoy the steam room and jacuzzi. The pools were long. But I found them so narrow and too close to the buildings - they had the feel of your local neighborhood apartment complex swimming pool. There is only one place where you can get towels and you have to look for it - in a resort this size, adding an extra location is an inexpensive option. Lastly, there is really not much to do around the resort (I know this sounds insane to some people) But I was bored a considerable amount of the time and likely found many others who were experiencing similar bouts of boredom.) I've never had that problem in the other resorts we stayed. Again, having stayed at similar resorts in the mayan riviera, you get considerably more for your resort $.  Guests currently stay in one of four buildings - with construction for an adjacent resort going on extended hours (yes 10pm) just yards from Bldg 4, we recommend you not stay in that building unless you enjoy looking at concrete blocks, watching construction, or need the sound and pounding of construction equipment to relax. Bldg 1, on the other hand, is a few yards away from another resort, and should you stay there, you'll have the view of another brighly colored building with many balconies staring right at you (there are not trees to block the view) If you don't like either option, plan on having a talk with the front desk staff (we were told they respond better if you fake being extremely angry) since there's a 50% or better chance you'll end up in one of those buildings. With the problems we encoutered at the hotel, I spent considerable time at the front desk and can assure you the front desk personnel spend a considerable amount of time moving people from Bldg 4 to Bldg 1 to - sorry that's all we have available. We lucked out ( if you want to call it that), in that out first room was in Bldg 3 facing the pool with a partial view of the oceanThe room: with three of us (my wife, daughter and yours truly) we ddecided to splurge on a colonial suite. Initially, we were given a room on Bldg 4, but requested we move to a different bldg and were given another room in Bldg 3. The suite was spacious - two separate rooms with entry, living room, small dining area a sseparate bedroom, jacuzzi, and bathroom with two sinks and one toilet (two would have been nice for a suite). We were pleased with the view of the pool and the partial view of the carribean. We soon found out the hotel had booked extra very pesty guests in our room - apparently the ceiling tiles were not placed correctly and that allowed flies and mosquitos to make an unhindered trip from the very hot ceiling to our room. we informed housekeeping and the maid promptly sprayed some very noxious cock-roach spray in our room - we informed here that we had flying insects and that spray would not work. Language barrier aside, I think she did her best to get us out of the room and into the pool while the insect spray went away. We also found out the shower drain was completely plugged and water would spill out onto the bathroom floor. In order to not re-live the nightmare that we encountered, suffice it to say, it took the hotel three days to fix the drain and on the fourth day a very very angry man concerned about the dozens of mosquito bites on his daughter and wife's legs, not to mention his own, to demand a different room or they would be finding new accommodations elsewhere. We finally moved to another room in Bldg 2. Up to that point, we were literally counting the days when this vacation would end. Things started improving a bit after our move. The new room had small ants everywhere - even our clothes, but we only had 1-2 occasional mosquitos to contend with and the bed did not serve as a biting bug motel like the other room. Also, by then we had ratcheted our expectations way down.Maid service: the maids in our rooms were consistently good and did a decent job in keeping the rooms clean as long as you allowed to come to your room before 12pm. After that, they may or may not come back. THERE IS NO TURN DOWN SERVICE at this resort. So make sure you have enough towels if you plan on taking two showers a day. Each day, we left a $3 tip along with a cosmetic item (my wife got 11 items from the $1 store to leave)I am not sure if this made a difference, but I felt our maids deserved it.Food; As much as I'd hate to revisit this subject, I guess I have to. This is hands down among the worst all inclusive food we've had. This is good if one of your goals in this vacation is to loose weight. I certainly did and so did many guests I talked to. As I mentioned previously, I refused to touch any salads, cakes, cheeses, cold cuts or any other item that required cool temperatures for the appalling lack of refrigiration and ice. The hot foods were without exception cooked almost beyond the point of recognition - I had a tough time finding a single item that would have any crunch to it - broccolio, caulifower, beans, rice, potatos, tomatos, cabbage - you name it, they were all cooked to the point where teeth were no longer needed. Soups were no different - each night you would have a selection of 1/2 dozen of soups that were all cream of something. Meats were inconsistent - some cuts were soft while others were girzzly and very tough. The food invariably was cooked with very little salt (and I watch my salt intake) and no consideration to herbs or spices what-so-ever. Here again, I want to mention the lack of generosity of this resort - limited vegetable selection, limited seafood (shrimp only offered in a paella - no asparagus, no scallops, no salmon, no clams, muscles- You get the same ho-hum offerings day after day - steamed potatos, boiled potatos, steamed then boild potatos...) For breakfast, my wife an I kept joking about how many different ways the cooks found to cook eggs - there were never less than 10- dishes made with eggs - omelett with cheese, omelett with ham, eggs over and easy, boiled eggs, plain omelett, scrambled eeggs, plain egg quishe, etc. The problem was there was very little else that was offered. For fruits, they constantly served, watermelon, cantelop, oranges and pineapple. NOTHING ELSE. Oh, we did find out for breakfast, you can have papaya or mango - but you have to request it directly from the cook there and you have to do it before 8:30 am because apparently both papayas are gone by then. Accordingly, I survived on rice and beans for three meals a day. Food lifesavers: The main buffet offers two pasta cooked to order stations and a lot of people took advantage of it to get out of eating the other food - there, the selection is very limited too - choice of the same 3 red sauces, 2 white sauces, 3 pastas, onions, green peppers, red pepper, canned (not fresh) mushrooms, and olives. I also heard the pizza there was good - my wife enjoyed a few cheese laden slices and I tried one - I found it acceptable.Breakfast: You can have a cook to order omelett with your choice of ham, cheese and onions - that's it folks. Also, they offer a milk-shake bar and I recommend the Zapote (local fruit) shake.Specialty restaurants: The Gourmet french restaurant is good for one dinner - we liked the steak they prepare there.  Beyond that, the food in the specialty restaurants is sub-par. We read the Japanese Teppenyaki restaurant is good and promptly made a reservation. For those of you familiar with such restaurants, you sit in a communal table and watch a chef expertly prepare food in front on you while doing various death defying tricks. We've been to many such restaurants and find the chefs are usually very funny and they've had years to practice and refine their craft. Our experience here was no less than comical. Our chef Francis must have literally read about Teppenyaki two hours before preparing our meals. His entire show consisted of playing catch with a supposedly raw, but obviously boiled, egg with two of the nine guests that were at the table. Next door, we heard sounds and applause from guests who were supposedly appreciative of their chef - but in our room, absolutely nothing. The silence was deafening. After a while, Francis broke down and confessed I don't know..... he said. He stopped short of cyring - but then at least we knew what to expect. By the way, here, the resort's lack of generosity again reared its head. Instead of lobster, scallops, prawns, steak etc that we had come to expect in other such restaurants - our choices were steak, chicken and shrimp with vegetables. That's it. The food tasted average - seasoning limited to salt and hoisin sauce. Here again, I was surprized to see the food sit there unrefrigirated for the rest of the night - our reservation was at 6:30 pm but I felt really sorry for the people who would come in at 9:30pm.What's even more comical is that every guest we talked to who at at the Japanese restaurant had Francis. I am now convinced that Francis is the only teppanyaki chef there and the noises we heard next room were a recording (I guess I've been watching LOST too much)Our theory on why food is so bad: We were later told (this is true) that all leftover food from the resorts had to be shipped and fed to actual prison inmates in the Dominican Republic. Service: at the main dining rooms, service is extremely inconsistent. Please, know that any tips you leave on the table must be shared by all service employees alike. This may in part explain the lack of consistent service for what incentive is there for one person to work hard while others don't. (If you do receive exceptional service and you wish to acknowledge that person with a tip, you must give it to them in their hand. Then, it is ok for them to keep it.) Here, expect that you may get water and possibly be asked if you would like to drinks something. No more. (your dishes may pile up on your table and they may not clear them until you leave). If you get better service than that, you would not get dissapointed. Another extremely dissapointing aspect of food service is the hours of operations. The main buffet breakfast in open from 7:30 - 10am. With the excpetion of the continental breakfast that offered by the beach, more on that below, nothing is served again until 12:30 pm. Keeping in mind, there is nothing to do at the resort after 6:00pm except for eating at the restaurants, a show that begins at 10 pm and goes till about 11:30pm and a smoke-filled disco that warms up about 11pm, your choices are to go to bed early so you can wake up for breakfast, or attend the show and take your chance at missing breakfast in which case you'd have to wait till 12:30pm to have a decent bite to eat. I am sure this resort will find the benefit of moving their breakfast hours to say 8am - 11am in the next couple of years. Room Service: You could order room service any time - Here's the actual menu: cheese, fruit, croissant, and jam $17 US Dollars plus 18% tax and $5 deliverySame as above but comes with eggs - $22Hamburger: $12Cheeseburger $14Steak: $22choice of 3 deserts: $8 eachAgain all items carry 18% tax and $5 deliveryContinental breakfast: Supposedly offered at the seaside facility from 10:30am to 11:30am for those who miss the buffet breakfast. The selection is pitiful: omeletts cooked to order with cheese and onions (if the grill is working or if the cook doen't run out of cheese and onions -usually within the first 30 minutes), stale bread rolls, unrefrigirated processed ham, and 2-3 fruits. If you look closely, you'll find tiny ants crawling all over the food and service utensils - occasionally you'll find someone who actually try to wave at the flies that come to have breakfast here. Sadly enough, this is the only place where you can get decent table service. Shows: A few of the shows are pretty good - after a few days, we found them to be somewhat loud and repetitive - so we avoided going there altogether. Plus, attending the shows, meant we would nothing to eat until 12:30pm and if you had dinner at 6:30pm, that was too long of a wait. One aspect of the theatre that I felt was wierd was how the seating was split up.Basically, the area facing the stage had no seating whatsoever going all the say back to the end of the theatre. So, there was this huge (abot 60 feet wide) open area in the middle of the theatre. Guests could sit to the left or the right of the theatre and only had one way to come in. This is difficult to explain but if you go there, you'll see exactly what I mean. I fail to find a reason for that for there were no performances in the middle of aisles. Exursions: This was the highlight of our stay there. Getting out of the resort made the stay more tolerable. My #1 recommendation if you wish to see the area is to hire a cab for 1 day($150) request an English speaking driver - the one we had is Franklin. The hotel will find a reputable and safe driver for you and you'll have a chance to customize your sightseeing. The nearest town is Higue (about 1 hour away) and there you'll find a cathedral that will blow your mind (it is of similar scale and magnificence to the grand cathedrals of Europe). We also recommend a trip to La Romana where there are numerous tourist things to do, including Altos de Chavon (where they filmed Jurassic Park, Rambo, Anacondas, and other movies) If you like to see the life of luxury, ask your driver to take you to Casa de Campos where you'll see the homes of Sammy Sosa, Steven Segal, Eddie Murphy, Steven Segal among other stars. If you're looking for authentic life, the city of La Romana is wonderful. You ccan also stop by a sugar plantation, a rum factory. Another option is to go on an exursion (wrip-off artists - I mean representatives are awaiting for you in the lobby of the hotel. You'll pay about twice the price and you're likely to see a watered down version of what is advertised (a visit to a rum factory means you'll stop by a rum store to purchase rum - a visit to a school means you'll drive by a school, a visit to a sugar plantation means you'll be taken to another store that sells goods for five times what you pay elsewhere and the drivers openly get a cut of the action. - Here but it is still an option.I heard some wonderful things about the capital Santo Domingo, but we did not have a chance to go there.Pharmacy: Make sure you bring insect repellant and some anti-itch cream with you. You will be bit whether you stay at the beach during the evening hours, you get our room in Bldg 3, or if you go out for an exursion. After I asked four different people at the resort about where to get anti itch cream for us and recieved 4 different answers - I learned there is a small pharmacy on premises next to the medical center. I was surprised to see the person there spoke excellent English but dismayed she wanted to charge $20 US dollars for a 1 oz tube of anti-itch cream (compare to about $5 in the US and $1.50 outside of the resort) and anther $20 US dollars for a small bottle of insect repellant. At first I thought she was asking for $20 Dominican dollars and then I thought she was haggling. She made it quite clear the price was $20 US and that prices were set. I later learned she charged $1.50 to other guests for 4 bandaids.

<Content>Our Wedding @ the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana We arrived at Majestic November 15th  the resort took our breath away, it was absolutly gorgeouse. We were upgraded to an ocean view room  it was breathtaking. The room was huge, had a beautiful view  was very clean  elegant. We met with our Wedding Coordinator Larissa the second day we were there to decide what kind of flowers, food etc we would have for our wedding which was to take place on November 20th at 6 pm. It took all of 30 minutes to make some decisions  it was very quick  easy which is what we wanted. Larissa knows what she is doing and makes you feel very comfortable  confident that everything will go exactly as planned.We brought our Wedding clothes to Larissa to be steamed  it took a little while to get our clothes back but she assured us we would get them and not to worry! She was right, they were back in our room the day before the wedding/steamed  pressed.We used the photographer at the resort who was absolutly amazing. We had casual pictures done the day before the wedding and then pictures the day of the wedding and they all turned out beautifully and we actually ended up paying more so we could get them all as we could not decide which ones not to take they were all so beautiful! Our photographer was Dimi  his last day at the resort was actually the day of our wedding, but all the photographers there seem great.The day of the wedding was very relaxing  stress free esecially because we had some time to relax as we weren't getting married until 6 pm. Our photographer went to Scott's room first to take some pictures of him before coming to my room. We had pictures done before the wedding as it was going to be too dark after the wedding. The day was beautiful and hot! After the pictures were done I went back to our room with my parents  we waited for the Justice of the Peace to arrive. Scott was with everyone else at the beach bar. The Justice of the Peace was about 10 minutes late which was not a big deal. We were married on the beach and everything went very smooth  the flowers were gorgeouse and more than we could have asked for. The ceromony was very short  sweet which again is what we wanted.After the ceremony we went to the seafood resturant and the table that we were sitting at was beautifully decorated and off to the side which made it a bit more private. We were so amazed with the day it all turned out so well, we really could not have asked for anything more. After dinner  cake, we went back to our room for speaches/toasted etc as there were only 12 of us total. It was so nice to be able to go back to our room with such a small group and the rooms were large enough to accomodate us all. It was the perfect day and a day we will never forget!Larissa works so hard  plans so many weddings its amazing. We would recommend anyone to get married at this resort, it was a wonderful experience  we truly could not have asked for anything more. Scott  Karla - Edmonton, Alberta Canada

<Content>Beautiful Three of us stayed at the Majestic Nov. 29-Dec. 6. My husband , myself and our 12 year old son.  We were greeted with a Majestic and a cold towel at check-in. Viktor was very helpful, when we arrived at our room there was only a king bed, he offered me a different room but said that the view was not very good (building 3), he told me housekeeping could bring a bed in to our room which I agreed to. When I told my son he was not very happy thinking he was going to be sleeping on a cot for a week, but when they arrived it was an actual bed with a boxspring and mattress. Our room was poolside in building 2, #2228. Great location, pretty much in the center of the resort, shower was huge, not a problem with the open concept toilet, we just sent whoever out on the balcony. Never saw bugs in the room. Pillows are kinda flat but there were some in the closet on the top shelf.Our favorite dinner was in the Rodeo steakhouse, we ate there 3 different nights, also went to Taino, buffet, my husband and I went to Le Gourmet for my birthday. I had read a lot of complaints about this one, but I was pleasantly surprised, we had a great meal. We never had to wait for service or drinks, and Yecy is fabulous. She was always somewhere different, working very long days.The pool is incredible, so long and spacious. There is always people cleaning it early in the mornings. We never had a problem getting 3 chairs together and a small table. We prefer to be near the pool entertainment so my husband and son can participate. The beach is beautiful, and while we were there it was actually warmer than the pool. The sand has a pinkish tint to it and the water is the color you expect for the carribean, even though it is on the Atlantic. We went to the nightly entertainment a few times, the Michael Jackson show was by far the best. Well done, even better than some I had seen in Vegas.My husband booked us a side-by-side massage on my birthday and then I had a manicure and pedicure. I can't remember her name but she did a good job on my nails.There were not a lot of kids there. Never saw anyone at the kids club. But we didn't hang out up there either. My son joined in on all the water polo, volleyball, pool volleyball, beach olympics but he was usually the only kid. No seperate activities for kids his age. That would be the only bad thing i could say about this resort. We had a fabulous time, lounging around, hanging out in the sun. I would definitely go back.

<Content>delightful week Compact , without ever creating the feeling of being crowded, this was a wonderful place to spend a week for our party of four adults and two teens. Staff was very friendly and helpful (got us the tennis courts lit up earlier at dusk).the place is as clean as any such I have seen in the past forty years.Things generally work, none in our party had tropical stomach problems.Food variety is large, even though the over-all display remains much the same from day-to-day.We particularly enjoyed dinners at the steak and lobster restaurant run by Robinso Pereira and his gang.(Walk in early to get a table on the side where they serve the steak chateaubriand!)We shall return!

<Content>loved the majestic Hotel  location lovely - right on the beach. The first day met Denny, the beach concierge who was friendly  helpful. We looked forward to seeing him daily. Also, Francisco Paulino, general mgr. was very helpful  friendly (as were so many of the staff) he went out of his way to try to accomodate our party of 6.

<Content>Ohhhh My Lord, Yeahhh "Paradise Found" I did stay at Majestic Colonial Punta Cana with my wife and two children. The level of service provided at this resort exceeded our expectation as it was our first time in Dominican Republic.When we got to the resort we had assign room 3224 on the second floor so I requested to be in the ground floor, Angel the Front Desk supervisor changed our room and nicely explained us that the extra bed and cradle that were in our former room were going to be moved in half en hour to room 3101. After 15 minutes we had both things in our new room.All the food was varied they have 7 different restaurants: gourmet, seafood, steak house, Asian which includes Japanese and Chinese, the Taino for Dominican Buffet and Mexican option a la carte.The best meal the y serve is definitely breakfast in the main buffet, the omelettes are really good. My only recommendation is that they should have a Kid corner with finger fish, nuggets, French fries and more options for the youngest. That we really missed!!!!!Another member of the staff who really needs to be mentioned is Fermin the beach concierge very professional, he bring drinks, towels all over the beach and believe me the beach is really big. Thank Fermin for the Spanish lessons.

<Content>Just returned As other reviewers have stated, the property is lovely and well-maintained; the beach is magnificent; rooms are probably above average for an all-inclusive. The food, while plentiful, was way below average. Service in restaurants was uneven, but staff were always pleasant.Stretching and aerobics on the beach with Lana and Melvin were a lot of fun. Denny, the beach concierge, was a hard worker and was very responsive to our needs. BEWARE: if you've come here because the website advertised in-room internet, don't count on it being operational -- service was spotty (i.e. non-existent) for the most of our week's vacation. This was a major problem for one person in our group, who really needed to have access for work (and specifically chose this resort based on the availability of internet access in room). There is a business center with high speed internet, and wireless in the lobby (not always working).

<Content>One of the Best Resorts I have traveled all over the Dominican Republic and talking from expereince I can say that Majestic Colonial Punta Cana was one of the best resorts I have ever been to. The hotel it self was beautiful, elegant and easy to get to everything. The 1km pool is the only one on Domincan and it was perfectly positioned in the middle of the resort giving plenty of room to have a pool side view. The food, spectaculer. The options are endless at the buffets and to be able to have gourmet style lobster or steak everynight at the a la carte made my trip that much better. The set up for Christmas eve was out of this World, I don't think I have seen so much beautiful food in one place at one time. The entertainment staff were super friendly and so energitic both at the pool and the beach that just listening to them get everyone involved you want to join on the fun to. They smile the whole time and it's for real not for show and they sing an dance and become your best friend right from day 1, the only reason I'm writing this review is really beacause of them. The live shows at night were better then most musicals I've seen and it's all included. Overall my family, friends and I all enjoyed every bit of the resort, they left nothing out and I give them 3 thums up instead of 2. I would go back again and I highly recommend it to everyone, even those with kids cause they had a whole set up and activitiies for them all day long. Stop reading and go and experience it for yourselves.

<Content>Bring towels! I have travelled to many, many all inclusives through the years, first staying at Club Meds, later on at much fancier resorts. What I missed at many of the more posh places was a lively activities team. It was ok if you wanted to sit on the beach or at the pool all day but I like to play games, do water aerobics and meet other people. The best thing about the Majestic Resort was their animation team. They kept you hopping with fun events, dance lessons, water aerobics etc. etc. They encouraged people to get involved and didn't cancel events because they were lazy. They really made the effort all the time! They also had several evening events that were fun as well.As for the resort itself, it is quite beautiful and well maintained. The food is fair -- nothing to write home about. The fact that they advertise several different restaurants is not a big deal. Most of the places have very similar menus. I am the sole vegetarian in my family but I found the salad bars extremely boring. Usually all inclusives have expansive choices for non-meat eaters but this resort did not. Each restaurant had a salad bar but they basically consisted of lettuce, cucumber, carrots and chopped cabbage with a couple of Chef's special salads which had fish in them. A little disappointing for me. I am not a big drinker but I was told that the liquor was not up to par, especially the tequilla. If you like to have poolside drinks delivered it doesn't happen here. Be prepared to go up to the bars yourself. The major gripe with this resort was the lack of beach towels. When you arrive each person is given ONE towel card. This entitles you to one smallish towel at the pool. Not a bath sheet, this towel does not cover the fairly uncomfortable plastic pool chair. If you come out of the pool dripping and dry yourself off with it you have to put it back on your chair wet. You cannot talk the towel dispenser person into giving you two towels. He is a towel security person and cannot be swayed. If you take your towel poolside so you have it when you get out of the water,and it is stolen, you are told you will have to pay $25.00 for another towel!!!! So bring your own beach towels with you!!!!! We also only had 2 bath sheets in the room, plus two hand towels and one wash cloth. They are certainly cheap when it comes to towels.Also remember to bring books with you - their little library cart has very few books in English.They also skimped when it came to having chalk around the pool tables (finally a tiny chalk appeared on our 5th day there) and the ping pong paddles were an embarrassment until late in our trip when they were finally replaced.All in all, we had a fun week - the weather was glorious, the grounds were beautiful, and the staff was very friendly.

<Content>Great Family Vacation My mother chose this hotel after much research and time and decided this would be the best hotel for us. We traveled as a family (6 people total) with kids ranging in age from 18-25. The airport was a very easy and quick process. Everyone has to pay for a $10 tourist pass, but everything else was very quick and easy, we found our bus quickly, but if you needed a taxi there were plenty available.  The ride from the airport to the resort was about 30 minutes and allowed people to see how the real Dominicans live, which I actually enjoyed. My mother however gets bus sick very easy, and was not feeling great by the time we got to the resort. Check-in was as expected, not as easy or quick as in the United States but still pretty easy. They had the name wrong for one of our rooms, so that took some time to get fixed but not too bad. The only problem was that we asked for 2 rooms with 2 beds but did not get any, all 3 rooms only had a king size bed, and one of our rooms was not ready when we checked-in and was not ready for some time. The Rooms:The Rooms are very nice, but I understand how some people complained about the lack of privacy in the bathroom. It really is not a big deal, but it is an open bathroom set-up, so beware. Our room was on the first floor with a view of the pool, and a hot tub on the back porch, which was very nice for relaxing at the end of the day, but if you do not like the music and noise from the pool, you may not want a room on that side of the building.Just another point, since we had 3 rooms I saw what people said about how some rooms were cleaned much better than others, including how many and what types of towels varying from room to room. I do not have much of an explanation for this, but did see this as well. However a few dollars go a long way with the staff, so keep that in mind!The Bars:All the bars had good, middle to top shelf liquor. I was very pleasantly surprised when I saw they had Stoli vodka, as well as Jack Daniel's, Johnny Walker, and other premium brands. All bartenders are pretty helpful, and very helpful and fun if you are willing to tip a little. The Food:I found the food to be pretty good. Now let me point out that none of my family are the type of people that live to eat, or are extremely critical of food. If you are that type of person, this section can probably be skipped over, because you might have completely different opinions than myself. With that being said, none of us had much of a problem with feeling sick. If you want to be adventurous with what you eat, you can, or if you want to stick to the basics, it is very easy to do that as well. The breakfast buffet I found to be very good. It does get crowded and have a slight summer camp feel with all the people wandering around, but food is good and there is a wide selection. The lunch is much better at the buffet than at the Restaurant La Hispaniola (which is closer to the beach and pool), which kind of stinks, but it is not bad to get out of the sun for a little extra time. Shirts are required which I actually preferred but I did see some people get upset with being asked to leave or cover up during lunch. We did not eat at all the restaurants, however the ones we did for dinner were good. The Steak House and Restaurant Tres Carabelas are located in the same place out by the pool and beach. These are nice places and the dress code is pretty casual, as long as you have on a polo shirt and shorts for the guys it is fine. We also ate at Restaurant Le Gourmet, which required a reservation and was much fancier than the other restaurants. The food was pretty good, and the dress was more formal with all men in pants but most still in flip flops. Come to think of it, I wore nothing by flip flops all weeks! The only other place we ate was Restaurant Taino which was the Dominican/Mexican restaurant. As expected this food was good, but upset all of our stomachs slightly, but the same would have happened if we had at a Mexican restaurant in the US!The Beach/Pool:The beach is gorgeous! The water is crystal clear, the sand is very clean, and there are plenty of chairs and cabanas for everyone. One thing about the beach is a lot of women go topless, which might be an issue for some American families, however is not allowed by the pool, so if it bothers you, stay by the pool. The Pool also has plent of chairs and very clean, although it is louder and filled with younger children than the beach. There is some great snorkeling right off the shore, and the waves were pretty calm the whole time we were there. The entertainment from the Animation Team was great. The dances and contest were very fun to watch and participate in. My family's personal favorite from the team was Jimmy, he was always looking out for us, and knew all of our names after only a short time there, but watch out he is a VERY good volleyball player. Overall I would say the vacation was GREAT! The main reason we went was for the Sun, Beach, and relaxation, and we got all that and more. Sure some things could have been a little nicer when it came to the room, but you know what, I go on vacation to get out of the house, so that was the last of my concerns. One more plus I forgot was the TV in the rooms are actually pretty good, with most channels in English including ESPN, and every room we saw had a DVD player, which is nice if we had remembered any DVDs. This was my second trip to the Dominican in two years during the month of December and it has only rained for about 2 hours total over the two weeks, which also helps makes for great vacations.

<Content>What a blast! Just wanted to comment on how well everything went during our stay at the Majestic. As the bride, I'm so grateful to Larissa, the wedding coordinator for being so accomidating, and giving me more than I could have ever dreamed my wedding would be. Everything down to the room upgrade and small gifts in our suite contributed to the ultimate wedding experience. Props go to the pool bar to one of the best bartenders I've ever had, Vladimir, you made our stay so wonderful, and made us feel welcomed. Thank you for remembering our names after the first time we told them to you, and for the fabulous variety of drinks offered. Take care of your new baby, Vlad, miss you! And a shout out to Nelson, on the pool deck. Happiness radiates from you. And thanks for the speedy drink service, and for letting us borrow your tray to get to the other side of the pool. You made our trip worthwhile. Also, thanks to the bartender at the Disco for returning the sweater I forgot at the Disco to me, I love that sweater, you made my day! Wonderful job to everyone.Thanks again,Karla and Sean

<Content>Simply fantastic and relaxing! My family of three stayed at the Majestic from Dec 14 - 21. We have a 51/2 years old. The experience was just fantastic. We arrived late on the first day - after midnight - and the check in went perfect. We had emailed them a few days prior to ask to be in building 2 based on reviews we had read here and sure enough, we were in a great room - 2118 - facing the pool with a great patio, about half way along from the main building to the beach. Thanks Rafael!The food was great - of course, this is an all inclusive in a developing country so to expect the same kind of food as we would in a North American or European resort would be naive (although it is clear that many still do). If this is your expectation, then you best stay in NA. That being said, we found there was a huge variety at the main buffet, with some changes day to day, but there was always something to eat for even the picky 5 year old. We ate mostly at the main buffet but also went to the Japanese Teppanyaki (you need to make reservations there - be sure to do this as soon as you arrive), and the a la carte Steak place. Be sure to try the chateau b. it is pretty great given that beef is not the specialty in the DR. Drinks were plentiful and delicious - try the mojito at the main bar but do it early in the eve as they run out of fresh mint by late night. The resort was very clean - sometimes there were some cups and stuff left by poolside, but a friendly request gets them cleaned up. The beach is amazing! We are early risers so we always got a great spot whether we were at the beach or pool. The beach is spotless, with lots of umbrellas and the softest sand ever! If you want huge waves, take a walk around the bend to the next resort as this part of the beach is pretty calm. The staff is amazing - like any all inclusive in this part of the world the rule is to be nice and friendly, slide a dollar or two when you get great service and they will appreciate it. We got a stack of US ones and it was very helpful for tipping. I went to the casino almost every night and if you hunt around, you can get a great game of hold 'em going - they also have other poker games, blackjack and roulette. The dealers were great - professional and fun. We have been to DR once before at another resort and in the Mayan Riv and liked this best of all. We will certainly return!!

<Content>Beware of Food! I stayed in Majestic Colonial in January 2007. Nearly a year passed but still my food impresions are with me. 4 years ago I stayed in Melia Caribe Tropical and although the food there is nothing extraordinary, but still much better than in Majestic Colonial.In Majestic Colonial the food is Ok only for US people: hamburgers, hot-dogs, pseudo-italian pizza and bad coffee - everything they got used to. For European guests the hotel food will seem untasty and with limited choice. Also I do remember dirty, greesy plates in self-service restaurants. Disqusting!Beware food poisoning! 2-days medical check and necessary treatment provided by nice and professional hotel doctor costs U$D400. Include medical insurance in your trip!If you are planning to go in January, be ready to strong wind and 1-2 times a day heavy rain.The hotel is quite new, but quality of the construction works are very-very low.Many mosquitoes. But do not worry: they are Domenican - very relaxed and therefore easily to kill.Take a 30-minutes walk along the beach: and visit a nice hotel - RIU Palace. Or maybe it is better to visit it in web before purchasing your trip and choose it instead of Majestic Colonial?..

<Author>MrFantastic74
<Content>A great honeymoon My wife and I stayed at the Majestic between December 6th and 20th, 2007, and this was our honeymoon vacation. We had a wonderfully relaxing stay, despite the stormy weather for more than the first week of our stay. We managed to obtain a room upgrade due to being on honeymoon, which was nice, especially since the hotel was booked solid. We started off in a room overlooking the construction, but were moved to one that sort of had a view of the beach.I will break down this review into three sections: Negatives, Positives and Notes.Negatives:1. BEWARE OF THE PRO PHOTOGRAPHY SESSIONS! Since it was our honeymoon, a special event in our lives, my wife and I decided to get some professional shots done via the photography studio's photo session. When we were first approached by one of the photogs about the session package, we were concerned about the price. The photog explained that it was $8 USD per digital pic and $10 USD per printed pic, and that we could choose as many or little as we liked, but with a minimum of 10-15 shots. This was acceptible to us, as we were willing to spend between $150 and $300 for pictures in total. She also said the photo session was about an hour long, and that it was of no extra charge for service. On the day of our shoot, our photographer ended up being Alejndro (Alex), who was a nice guy who gave us a great time during the shoot. He worked with us for almost 2 hours and took almost 200 shots. When it came time to choosing our pictures in the studio later that night, however, we ran into some difficulties. Alex tried to sell us the whole packge with all pictures and a variety of prints for almost $1300 USD. I tried to explain that we only wanted digital images, and only some of the shots, but he insisted we listen to him while he ran down a list of different packages and prices. When it became clear to him that we were only going to purchase a select bunch of the digital images, he became less and less service oriented, and basically rolled his eyes at us when we were eliminating pictures from the selections. He almost made us feel guilty for not buying all of his precious works of art. We finally settled on 43 digital images for $344. He told us it was cash only... How could he expect anyone to have been carrying $1300 cash?! We didn't have enough cash to pay for this package, so we had no choice but to use the ATM. The ATM only gave Dominican pesos. Having been told by multiple vendors that the exchange rate is 32 pesos to the dollar, we took out the appropriate amount from the ATM. When we returned to the photography studio with our payment, they told us the exchange was 35 pesos to the dollar (if we wanted to pay in pesos)!... So we ended up having to take out even more money, even though I was obviously upset over this fact. By this point in time, we were no longer receiving service with a smile, and no thank yous were exchanged. Poor poor customer service skills. If you decide to have one of these sessions done, be sure to explain to your photog in advance that you only wish to purchase x amount of pictures; it may save you some trouble.2. Our on site travel agent, Felix, who works for Sunquest, was not at the least bit customer service oriented. We had cancelled an excursion due to the bad weather we had had every day of our trip up to that point. We had already rescheduled the trip prior to this, and were told by Felix that the weather would get better within the next couple of days. Five days later, the weather had not improved, and that's when we approached Felix again to cancel the excursion scheduled for the next day. We didn't want to be stuck on a boat in choppy waters in the rain with poor visibility for snorkelling. He was visibly disappointed by that, but we thought nothing more of it. As it turns out, the day of our would-be excursion had fair weather, but there was no way for us to have known. You have to cancel more than 24 hrs in advance, so we made the best decision based on the weather we had been experiencing. A few days later Felix approached us as we were minding our own business and stated that he wanted to make a complaint about us. He scolded us for not believing him that the weather would get better, and said that he's been doing his job for 5 years and knows the country very well. Then he left before we could say anything. Needless to say, we were shocked by the conversation, especially as it became apparent that he was merely disappointed over losing his commission for the sale. My wife's been in customer service for years and was shocked over his behavior. It was the first time she's seen a professional make a complaint about a customer.3. The games area, where they have foosball, ping pong, darts and billiards, is a little dillapedated and not well maintained. The equipment is either broken, dirty or missing vital parts. For those times of boredom between dinner and the evening shows, on nights when you want to do something other than drink at the bar, it would be nice to play games in that area. Oh well.4. Smoking is permitted EVERYWHERE, which is a problem for people like us who feel sick around cigarette smoke. Some of the inside or covered areas, including the theatre where the shows are put on, can get pretty smoky. Many people, usually of the non-English or non-Spanish speaking variety, just light up in the seat right next to you without asking... the same people who cut in front of you in the buffet lines, but that's another story... I saw a couple people smoking while strutting around in the pool. That was gross.Positives:1. The staff was excellent and helpful. They catered to all of our requests within reason, and only fell short when the language barrier got in the way. For instance, we ordered hot chocolate during the stormest and coldest of days, and received cold chocolate milk, even when attempting to order in Spanish... Doesn't caliente mean hot? :) No worries. We tipped the waiter for the hassle, as he was very friendly. 2. The pool, as everyone says, was amazing. It is so big that you are never lacking for a good spot. There are even areas where you can place your chair in shallow water areas while sunbathing. I only wish it had a deep section for diving. It was hip-deep water all the way around.3. The beach was beautiful, and we never had trouble finding a good seat there either. The water is aquagreen and crystal clear in parts. The waves were rough during the stormy period, but died down when the winds receded.4. The drinks are good. We reccommend the Majestic. We don't know what's in it, but it's delicious.5. The steak restaurant by the beach has great Chateaubriand. The pasta stations at the buffets are also very good.6. The entertainment (animacion) staff was great, and the activities they organized were fun. I recommend you get off your tush and participate. You just may win a nice bottle of rum, as I did! Say hi to Jimmy Sexy Black Banana Anaconda for me. I also recommend you learn the taki taki resort dance, and do it on stage after the nightly shows, or by the pool or at the beach in the morning/afternoon!7. The shows were good for the most part. Very similar to the ones we saw at the RIU Playacar in Playa Del Carmen Mexico. The Micheal Jackson show was probably the best one, but even the in-house animacion shows were entertaining. I do have one complaint against many of my fellow spectators, though. Clap! Give the performers applause for their efforts; it's only common courtesy. I find it very rude when people just sit there and do not give the slightest bit of polite applause, and there were quite a large number of spectators that fit that bill. Are you expecting the Cirque du Soleil? The real Micheal Jackson? Give me a break, people. Show some respect.Notes:Malaria.THERE IS MALARIA IN THE PUNTA CANA AREA. My wife and I did not take anti-malarial pills, but we took other precautions that we recommend you take as well. Since malaria mosquitos attack from dusk to dawn, we applied a 28% DEET insect repellent lotion (that didn't smell too bad at all) on all of our exposed skin at night. We would adjurn to our room at about 5PM, take a shower, etc., then apply the insect repellent before going back out. We also brought a $40 mosquito net with us that we slept under at night time, as we did see a few mosquitos in our room at night time. There is also dengue fever in the Dominican Republic, which is acquired via day-flying mosquitos, but the risk of acquiring this illness is much smaller. Just make sure to apply insect repellent when venturing out into rural areas.Tipping. We decided to tip at the bar or restaurants when we received friendly service with a smile, or service with that little extra something. It seemed to work out well for us. At no time were we displeased with the service or the drinks being served. We left $2 USD per night for the housekeeping. We never received any towels sculptures or fancy frills, but we did recieve lots of extra towels and coffee when we asked for it. Candies/ toys for the kids.We brought a bunch of toys and candies from a dollar store to the DR with us, with the anticipation of giving them out to children outside the resort. It worked out well for us; Dominican children are very receptive to this, as are their parents. We also thought we could use the items as bargaining chips with street vendors (we had heard of other people being successful with this), but we didn't really get the opportunity to try it out. We left what was left over for the housekeeper on our last day.Turista.Although my wife and I both took great precautions about not consuming tap water (we brushed our teeth with bottled water and never let any water enter our mouths when showering), and although we took the oral vaccine to prevent it, we still got a bout of Majestic revenge. This may be a result of churn-up due to the hurricane.Rooms.Yes, the lack of privacy when using the toilet is slightly annoying. My wife and I took turns waiting on the balcony while the other was using it. It's not too bad, though. The rest of the room is very nice.Food.Although we liked the steak and pasta, most of the food was simply ok. A 6 out of 10. Don't expect anything fabulous.

<Content>Good but nothing compared to Bahia next door. My husband  I stayed at the Majestic Dec. 8-15th. This is a very nice, clean well maintained resort but unfortunately my review is strictly based on a comparison to our stay at the Bahia two years ago. Punta Cana beaches are the best I have ever seen and I would go back but I would stay at the Bahia before returning to the Majestic.The food was very tasty with great selection but with that said, my husband  I both came down with the Majestic Revenge half way through the week and medication didn't seem to help. We spoke to many other guests who had the same problems on a variety of levels. Because of the tropical storm that passed through, someone suggested that maybe the water system was compromised.The staff was outstanding all very friendly and helpful. We never had any problems getting drinks and the maintenance staff were always hard at work.Our room although very clean, we never received a towel animal or flowers or nightly turndown service. One day our room didn't even get maid service. I agree with others that the bathroom was not very private and did become a problem when my husband  I contracted our bug. I did as others suggested and took scented plug ins and scented candles as the room was a little musty smelling. Our balcony partially overlooked the ocean and partially the construction site. The construction actually was a source of entertainment to my contruction worker husband who is in charge of health  safety. Many infractions in the Dominican  my husband got enough pictures to make an album of how not to do things.Overall we made the best of things and it was nice to get away and sit on the beach for a week.

<Content>Majestic-everything we needed for a great time 12/5-12/13-Sorry in advance if I start to babble too much.The main goal of this vacation was to sit on the beach in a tropical location and just relax. It鈥檚 been a tough, long year. It did not take long to get into it. We arrived at 4pm after a long shuttle ride that we got through Expedia. We were the last stop after dropping everyone else off. So after about 1.5 hours we finally got there. It was a rough ride. Tons of speed bumps going in and out of all the resorts. Next time without a doubt a cab is the way we'll go. We were served cold cloths right on the front steps when we got off the shuttle. That was great my face was really needed it. We checked in, had to wait for our room to be ready for about 20 minutes. Not that big deal we waited we had a couple of Majestics with RUM and they went down so fast. My husband got a brain freeze from it. YUM Tasted like an orange creamsicle. Richard then found us and took us on a tour and showed us to our room. He had only been on the job for a couple of days and that surprised me as he provided us with a TON of info on the place. He made us feel very comfortable fast. Our room was 2246 and the view of the beach is to your left and a part of the long pool is in front of you. We were closer to the beach end. The beach grill was the closest to our room for food for us and the rest of the food was down in the lobby area which took a couple of minutes to walk to, but we didn't mind because we were getting some exercise in. The balcony was a good size and anytime we ended up sitting out there-watching the ocean or the pool or the palm trees swaying it was hard to get up. I did email guest services a couple of times before we left so I think that helped with getting a room with a view like that. Laura Cortes from guest services always emailed me back and I thank her for her great customer service. We are no dummies so we made appointments before we got there for massages at 6 the day we arrived. We both got the deep tissue massage (85$) and they were very good. My body felt very relaxed after and my neck and shoulders were not sore anymore. My husband mentioned something about maybe drooling he was so relaxed. The food was fine. We always found something we liked at the buffets. Loved the thin crust pizza station. The Japanese teppenyaki(sp?) grill was very comparable in taste to good places we have around here. The gourmet restaurant was good. I had a chicken with risotto dish and it they did a great job with it.. The Mexican/Dominican restaurant was decent-we love Mexican food so its stuff we knew and it was quality. At the steakhouse I needed to find out what the hype was with the chateaubriand so I got it. It was more than ok-but I'm more of a rib eye fan. Overall we don't have much to complain about the food. Our attitude towards Caribbean resort food (a lot of the mass produced stuff) is that we just need to find something to soak up the alcohol and keep up energy. We know that wherever we go we鈥檒l find something we like and we did. There were so many different forms of pork that were tasty. They had a pig roasted one night at the buffet and we gobbled that up. oink oink.All the reviews about the beach and the pool are true. Solid A. Everything you'd want out of a beach if you鈥檙e a beach lover. I miss it the most. One day we spent with Tropical Storm Olga. Even though it was stormy all day it was a great experience to watch the ocean change so much. The waves were so angry and powerful I've never seen anything like it. We actually ended up getting a cab and went to the Hard Rock Cafe for lunch at the Palma Real Mall (short cab ride-15 or so minutes) and walked around in there during Olga. It鈥檚 a nice indoor strip mall. No bartering for paintings or wood carvings or magnets. It was good to get out and see our surroundings also.One day we also walked down to the shanty town shops on the beach that sell the souvenirs-about a 35-40 minute walk down the beach a right out of Majestic. We wanted to check it out and the walk was great. We weren't looking to load up on the souvenirs really but if you enjoy the whole bartering thing then this is right up your alley. I only got a pair of Larimer earrings for 10 bucks. Have no idea if they are real or fake but they look pretty. We also got to see other resort's beach set ups along the walk and we didn't see one that we liked more than Majestics. The shows at night-definitely campy but fun to watch with drinks. We went into the disco once and got down. The disco/sports bar was nice. It鈥檚 a small dance floor and the music was like being at a wedding reception back in States. We had a fun night in there so thats all that matters to us. I only have one area to complain about-the casino. All the reviews I read before I left said how rude and horrible the workers are in there. It鈥檚 all true!! The reviews are right on. If you don't know how to play the tables very well don't expect any cordial treatment. We went in there with 100 bucks to waste. They could have easily taken my money with my little gambling knowledge and I would have not been much of challenge. I changed a 20 dollar bill from the cashier and she gave me back all 5鈥檚. We went back to the table to play and one of the 5鈥檚 had a rip and the girl wouldn鈥檛 take it she made us go back to the cashier to change it. HUH???? All this with a scowl on her face, not even saying a word to us-just waving the ripped 5 in our face and eyeballing us to do something about it. MEAN AND NASTY GIRLS!!! Someone told me that they don't work for Majestic, that they are independent so that was the only explanation for them acting that way?? Who knows-maybe it was me. However-there are so many Majestic employees who helped make our stay so much more enjoyable and they work so hard to make their living. Working long hours and still keeping a smile on. Vladimir who typically worked the evenings at the bar outside closest to the lobby was really a good kid. My husband and I hope to stay in contact with him. He talked to us a lot about the Red Sox and baseball and found that we have a great love in common. All of the bartenders were great-Pablo, Felix. Joel in the beach grill was a great waiter and gave us great service. There was 2 men taking care of the beach-Denny and his co worker (forget his name!)always had new beach towels we could exchange our old ones for or if we wanted a drink they got it for us. EXCELLENT!!! Our room was always clean; the housekeepers did a great job. As far as tipping goes-we tipped. They deserved it for the good service they gave us. I brought $100 in ones and $50 in 5鈥檚. We definitely used all of that. I could go on because I was reading the thread on tipping this morning but I鈥檒l save my opinions about tipping for over there. In closing finally-there are ideally a ton of tropical places we鈥檇 like to go before we go back to Punta Cana and the Majestic. But the short money it takes to get there makes it very tempting to go back to the Majestic more often. It has everything we need to unwind, relax and get away from it all. We are already daydreaming about going back to the Majestic soon. p.s if and/or when you get into the mamjauna shots in between the beers or other cocktails-make sure you pace yourself. Maybe even sip it instead of doing a shot鈥?That stuff is no joke and it banged us up............peace

<Content>Very Relaxing! We booked our trip from CheapCaribbean.com. Overall, we felt received an excellent deal and were very pleased with the service they gave. However, they were unable to give us the rebates promised because I changed my credit card number after booking.When you collect your baggage at the very large hut they consider an airport, you will then be thrown into a pit of valets that want to take your bags and escort you to your transfer agency. Don't try to avoid them, its impossible, and you need them to get to your van, as you would never be able to find it. The drive was wild. There don't seem to be any driving rules in the Dominican at all, so I felt like I was putting my life into this maniac drivers hands. Apparently, you have to drive like that though or you will never get anywhere. There were motorcyles and scooters everywhere, some with three people on them, and it doesn't seem anyone wears helmuts. Despite all that, I never saw an accident while I was there.The country itself isn't much to see. Very, very poor. Most of the houses we saw were shacks with aluminum roofs. This is why many people feel it best to stay at their resorts.When we arrived at the hotel, we were given a cold towel (but no drink!) before check in. They were able to upgrade us to a poolside room. I was very disappointed when we got to the room. First of all, it had double beds and we requested a king/queen. It was also over run by flies and smelled terribly musty. The room was near the stairs and very loud with people coming and going. I called the front desk but was unable to get another room and they told me to call back the next day.We were able to get another room the next afternoon, less smelly, but this one had a mosquito problem. I was bitten at least twice a day, but my boyfriend escaped harm.The bathroom is a very weird set up if you are a new couple or traveling with friends. The tiny toilet stall leaves nothing to the imagination for other guests. The shower was very nice, but they only give you two towels, and if room service doesn't clean your room at the right time, you have to use the same set again. The tub only fits one person comfortably.Room service did a good job cleaning, but was very inconsistent with the timing. Also, I was expecting towel animals or fancy designs with the curtains or bedding. We didn't get that at all.The pool was beautiful, as was the beach. We never had a problem getting a chair at either place. the pool water was very cold. The ocean was gorgeous but a little rough. Also, the towel hut was extremely well stocked and we never had a problem getting new towels throughout the day. The man that worked there all day, every day was extremely pleasant.I thought the food was good in most cases if you stuck with the safe choices. Breakfast had lots of options. The omelet station was always popular but worth the wait. Lunch at either lunch buffet always had enough choices, and there was a good amount of variety from day to day.For the two restaurants that require reservations for dinner, make them the first day you arrive. Le Gourmet is well worth it and we ended up eating there twice. We never waited for a table at any of the other restuarants. I was very disappointed in the chateaubriand after reading all the reviews. It didn't impress me at all, and I love steak. Drinks were good, but its hard to find other options when you get sick of the sweet stuff. Sometimes it amused me when you ordered something because it seemed like each bartender made up something new for each drink. For instance, a mudslide at one point consisted of milk, chocolate sauce and vodka. The mamajuana shots were great fun. And don't let them tell you that it is just for men! The main bar on the bottom floor of the lobby area seemed to have the most options.We worked with Andreas from Turinter Tours and he was very helpful. We booked two excursions - the Kontiki Fun Cruise and the Buggies. Both buses to each excursion was an excursion of its own. In addition to the crazy driving, the all felt like they were going to fall apart. The excursions are not as well put together on other more established island. When we arrived at the beach for Kontiki, we had to get on a small motor boat to be transported to the larger boat. It turned out to be a great time. They made sure you had a drink in your hand at all times. Snorkeling was great! So beautiful! After that, they had sandwiches ready for you. Then they entertained you with dancing and some skits.The Dune buggies were also a lot of fun, but we had to drive through such a poor area, with children waving at you in front of their shacks and some trying to sell you things. They made a stop at a natural cave, but I think it was just an excuse to have you stop at people's tables where they try to sell you jewelry and paintings. Every store and place you go has the exact same stuff. Don't let them sell it to you for an expensive price, as most of it is cheap and will fall apart. We stopped again at a beach for more salesmanship. I was also uncomfortable that we didn't get helmuts for this. If you do it - prepare to get very dirty!The animation team was fun, but after a few days, it was just the same stuff over and over again. Plus, they only stayed at one area of the pool and never moved around. We learned not to sit near there when we weren't going to participate because it was distracting and annoying.We never saw any water activities available like snorkeling, kayaks, sailboats, etc, that were promised when we were booking. We thought it might have been because it was too rough.The photo store did offer private photo sessions. We saw what they did with several people. Really beautiful work. I'm upset that we didn't do this.Turinter got us back to the airport with plenty of time to spare. One note - if you are going to buy the Mamajuana, you need to get it pre-made or fill the bottle with rum after washing it out. They won't let you travel with just the bark, twigs, etc, as it is considered vegetation.Overall, we had a great time. This was only my second time at an all-inclusive. Overall, my experience at an Iberostar in the Mexico was much better, but this trip was extremely relaxing and we had a great time.

<Content>Had a GREAT time at the Majestic Finally getting around to writing my review.....my wife and I stayed at the Majestic from 12/5 thru 12/13.Been home almost a week and the trip is now but a memory....So to start off.....I've read a ton of reviews and tried to keep an open mind throughout the entire trip....I have to say I went in with guarded expectations and was in turn blown away.......might be a solid approach for others......but just one man's opinion.Anyways.....We had a shuttle from the Punta Cana airport to the Majestic and found out that its the last stop........if you'd rather have a 35 minute cab ride versus an hour and a half bumpy shuttle ride....its worth the 40 bucks....(the ride should only cost $35 us).Upon arrival we got the cold face cloth....it was great. The Majestic was a little slower to come, but was well worth it, even though there was no rum in it and I got an ice cream headache for drinking it so fast.Richard showed us to our room after 30 minutes while it was finished being setup after the previous guest had a late check out.We were in room 2246, it was faaaaaaaaantastic. The bathroom thing is a little odd. The jaccuzzi in the room was great, used that a few times.The bed was fine, pillows were flat, but extras are in the closet or a call away to the front desk.We always found the staff friendly, courteous, and always willing to help, even if it took a bit to find a common understanding.Our balcony overlooks the pool and the ocean/beach were easily seen.We were there to relax and took full advantage of the resort....we had massages shortly upon arrival (my wife booked them before we arrived) and I honestly will always do this for vacations. Talk about speeding towards relaxing.....unreal massage. The restaurants overall were good. The only ones that seemed to be cooked to order was the Japanes and French Restaurants.....both of which were fantastic. The Japanese was fun and delicious. I got a great cut of steak in the French place.The buffet always was a good time.....so much to choose from. Some dishes looked better than others....if it didn't look good to me, i didn't eat it. I never went hungry. You've got to be realistic for this one.....its a buffet. Better than any I have around home....but its a buffet none the less. I did however always see folks lined up to have food grilled fresh.The Mexican/Dominican place was really good. I love mexican food. The Dominican food is a buffet there and great stuff to choose from. You order off a menu for the Mexican and that stuff was real good too. We hit this place twice.The Steak House was good....not out of this world, but not the worst. Truth be told we never made it to the seafood place...the night we were going to go was Tropical Storm Olga....and we couldn't get from our room to the restaurant without getting wet....so we did the Mexican/Dominican....not at all disappointed by that.A few shout outs to the staff.......who was fantastic...Although we didn't participate in anything the Animation Team did....those guys and girls deserve a lot of credit....always having a great attitude even when participation is on the low side. The shows at night were pretty campy (maybe a little PG-13 too) but its vacation....relax....live it up....its not often you can watch Mr. Majestic or Michael Jackson.....take it for what it is....enjoy the shows!!Denny the Beach Concierge and the rest of the boys down there (didn't get everybody's name)....thank you for being there for towel changes in the morning and drinks throughout the day.Joel in the Steakhouse/Lunch Buffet.....thanks for the service and laughs.Pablo who was always in a different bar, but always quick with a fresh beer and a smile.Juan who was at the downstairs lobby bar....he introduced me to Mamajuana. I sort of hate you for that.....but i sort of love you too.Last but not least.....the man with all the tricks....at the bar outside the lobby, opened from 5pm to 11pm....is Vladimir!!! Always welcomed us with a big smile and hello and kept us entertained thru the whole night. It sucked when the TS put a damper on him opening his bar, we found him in at the show. In fact, if your going to be hitting up the Majestic....here is a preview of what you can expect to see from Vlad!!!![-]All in all, it was a great vacation and I would go back to the Majestic in a heart beat and would 110% recomend the Majestic friends, family, and even strangers.

<Content>Trip was ok, but the staff made it better. Overall our stay at Majestic Colonial was just ok. The resort was beautiful, but they go cheap on many things like no towels in the bathrooms throughout the resort, pool towels are highly monitored, food was very limited between 10:30 and 12:30, food was similar at many restaurants, you get charged for room service, you only get 2 beers per day in your room, and the unlimited booze doesnt include top shelf. I was disappointed in the food compared to other places I have been. The selection of seafood was very limited. Service was below my level of expectations for most except for a few staff members that made our trip very memorable. For instance, we checked in and they tried to put us in a lower priced room without telling us since ours wasnt ready yet, they never had change for tipping, our room wasnt cleaned one day, the phone in our room wouldnt dial out without numbers sticking and we got charged for making extra calls because of it, the beds were very hard, and they didnt always change our sheets. You mostly have to go get your own drinks when by the pool or ocean, and you have to wait quite a while for drinks when the bars are busy. I believe many of these issues are common with the other area resorts as well after talking with other tourists. Also, the nightly performances were pretty bad when they involved dancing. You could tell the dancers were not very experienced. Michael Jackson was ok and the Circus night was good.Once you leave the resort, the area is pretty sketchy. I guess it is comparable to Jamaica, but maybe a little worse.Not everything was negative though. The entertainment team by the pool was great, especially the men. Felix at the beach bar was awesome!!! Nelson overexceeded our expectations and even gave us dancing lessons, and he is sooo cute!!! If Felix, Nelson, and the entertainment team would not have been there, our experience would not have been the same. Pablo at the lower lobby bar was good as well. There were lots of families with small children and wedding parties. Most visitors were from Canada or Europe.

<Content>Beautiful Resort But!! We stayed at the Majestic Colonial the week of December 10, 2007 with a party of 3 adults and one child. The resort is beautiful and the gardens are extremely well maintained. I've never seen so many staff working at a resort. The pool is fantastic and stretches the whole length of the resort. We had storm that passed south of island through midweek which caused major power outages, however, the main lobby and restaurants still functioned. We didn't try the Japanese but the food in all all the other a la carte restaurants as well as the buffet was excellent. I tipped occasionally at the bars, but there is no real reason to. I actually had a $5 tip given back to me at the main lobby bar, the reason being it was unnecessary. My only complaint was that except for one adult, we all got sick by mid-week, which lasted about 24 hours. We were warned not to drink the water in the rooms but were assured that everywhere else use purified water; ice cubes, salad's etc. However, the problem I observed was extremely poor food handling and food preparation techniques. Every day I observed several staff preparing food with no protection on there hands. Also, cold foods like meats, cheese, etc, would sit out in the buffet restaurant, unrefrigerated. Even several freshly prepared cooked items were left to go cold after a few minutes instead of keeping them hot.Other than the food problems we encountered, I would still recommend the resort to anyone. Just be picky what you eat, and don't prepare yourself a cold meat sandwich. This was a common item we all had mid-afternoon one day and may have been the culprit.

<Content>One of the best hotels in Punta Cana We have just come back from a week at the Majestic Colonial from 10-17 Dec. We had read every single review on TripAdvisor which we found useful. I hope others find ours just as useful.Despite having landed in Punta Cana when Tropical Storm Olga made it's landfall, the Majestic Colonial made it all worthwhile. This was our 6th trip to the Dom Rep and our 4th to Punta Cana. Our first and hopefully not our last to this hotel.It did help that we had exchanged several e-mails with the Reservations Dept. (Rafael Ferreira: holiday-saviour) and hence upon our arrival, we basically got what we had asked for (room in preferred block, king-size bed). NOTE: the Majestic Elegance (a new hotel) is currently under construction next to the Colonial and if you are planning a trip to this hotel, request a room in either Block 2 or 3. Block 1 overlooks the entrance of the Grand Paradise Hotel (next door-lots of cars, buses, etc), while Block 4 overlooks the construction site of the Elegance. For some, the construction site could be a problem.Having said that, everything else is certainly worth it. The rooms are great and very big (and we had the standard Junior Suite-did use the whirlpool regularly for a relaxing time). We did not see one person using the outside Jacuzzi provided in the superior suites so it might not be worth the extra expense. These rooms are also swim-up but we go to the Dom Rep for the sea and sand, definitely not the pool (even though it really is an impressive one!).The grounds are extremely well cured and special attention is paid to small details. As mentioned to the staff, it would be great if people did not use the balcony railings in their rooms as clothes lines as it ruins the view of the entire place....especially for all the lovely weddings we saw during our stay (and there really were many!). A possible solution could be for an extendable line to be drawn up in the shower stall, which is triple the usual size.The food was excellent: we tried Buffet for breakfast and lunch, Matsuri-Oriental (as well as the special presentation that you need to book for), the lunch buffet at the beach (Hispaniola), the Rodeo Grill and the Fish place (Las Tres Carabelas) and the French restaurant (Le Gourmet) that requires reservation. They were all really good. 6 Nights did unfortunately not allow us to try the Taino (Caribbean).I think it is important for people to realise that when travelling abroad, it is important to look for the best the place has to offer and not look for exactly what you would have (or even expect) back home. Hence, the pasta is not Italian, the lobster is not the same as in Boston, the sushi is made in Punta Cana and not some sushi bar in New York. Having said this, we tried everything and it really was all very fresh, well-presented (yes, do try the Chateaubriand at the grill, the lobster at the seafood restaurant) they are fantastic!!Did get a wrap at the Spa and the treatment, as well as their prices, were OK (Europeans being favoured with the exchange rate).Small suggestions for improvements, besides the clothes on the balconies: some of the staff could improve their attitude towards guests (I don't appreciate the feeling of being completely pampered to but the opposite also has an effect-no-one likes to be completely ignored-I sincerely hope that this does not have to do with the different coloured wrist bands which I was told by management staff, is linked to geographic origin of guests), but rather to some members of staff who do not make the effort to catch your eye or even smile).Having said that, the vast majority is however very friendly, efficient, professional and eager to please; guests should, for hygenic reason, be required to cover-up at the restaurants: we did see many guests literally dripping sea/pool water when serving themselves at the buffet (by the beach) or using their fingers to serve themselves. This is revolting and controls should be improved or put into place; it would be nice to have a drinks/cocktail menu for those guests like myself who have no idea of what certain cocktails contain but would like to know/try out. Some of the waiters did not know themselves (!) and I even had a couple of drinks that contained various different ingredients!These are all small (some of them) things that could help improve the (already very good) service of this hotel.I hope that my review will help many TripAdvisor fans like myself to decide, but remember what's good for someone might not be the best for the next. There's nothing like trying it out for yourself.

<Content>Loved the Food and Hospitality 3rd trip to Caribbean, 2x in Jamaica, first time in Punta Cana. Family trip with 2 kids, 10 and 14, girl and boy, and 2 friends. Luxurious resort. Beautiful. Well Kept. Clean.Pros: Spacious rooms and grounds, EXCELLENT food and multiple fresh made and pre-made selections, you can eat as much fresh grilled whole lobsters you can fit, excellent animation and activity crews and all schedules are followed promptly, off property tours planned and exectued well(we did the 6 hour swim with the sharks, snorkel, and stingray interaction cruise)Cons: Construction on south side of resort, loud during the day. Language barrier- in Jamaica all is in English, here it was all Spanish, brush up on it a little. Beds are way TOO HARD. I mean it. I am not a baby with hard beds( camp on the hard ground in the summer), but these are uncomfortable beds if you plan on staying a week, expect a stiff back. Our friends stayed in another room, theirs were the same way. Same complaints. Beach is VERY WINDY, sand in the face on some days also rough surf. Alcohol was definately watered down. Rum is clear with no taste most of the time. Don't expect any help from the front desk after checkin, make sure all is in order before you go to your room. Alot of rude French Canadians. Used trip advisor for all trip prep, very helpful. Next time I would go to Iberostar.

<Content>Wonderful Experience Booked this for a 10 day honeymoon and couldn't have been more pleased with the experience. Some highlights:- The staff was absolutely amazing. They work ridiculously long days there and manage to smile and be cheerful til their 12th hour on the job. Make sure to tip staff - they make next to no money at all. They are always willing to talk and make it a point to ask them how they are doing - in the DR, small talk is polite, even if you are just asking them for a towel or drink. - Food was good. It was varied enough that I didn't get sick of it, even after ten days. Big thumbs up to Le Gourmet and the Japanese Restaurant. Book AS SOON AS YOU CHECK IN. Reservations go quickly and they are both totally worth it. Went back to both for a 2nd time.- Wear a Red Sox Shirt or hat - the locals love Big Papi and will treat you like a king/queen and offer to buy the clothes off your back!- The Circus and Michael Jackson shows were awesome. I highly recommend spending an hour there.-The rooms were great - had a Colonial Jr Suite with a hottub outside and view of the ocean. Couldn't have been better. -Denny was great as a beach concierge, very helpful. Freddy in the Buffet and Mexican Restaurant was a sweety. And there were several spectacular bartenders - mostly at the Piano bar, Lobby bar, and the bar in the entertainment area during shows. -As a gay traveller, it was difficult, mainly because what's accepted here in the States isn't really something the locals run into on a day-to-day basis. Kept getting asked where my husband/boyfriend was and getting hit on. We switched to being in the closet after having discussions and explaining to several staffers what the deal was - we just got sick of the long conversations and questions and wanted to enjoy vacation. Not their fault, but something to consider. Lots of gay couples there though!-Beach was nice, warm and wavy - if you are looking for a lagoon, this isn't the place. It was fun! Spouse found 40 bucks in the ocean one day! Sometimes schools of fish would surround swimmers - really cool.-Can't say much about activities - I was happy doing nothing!-Some tips: bring sunscreen and BUGSPRAY. The bugs aren't really pesty down there and they aren't very big. I found myself not even being able to spot some of them, but ending up with lots of little bites (the mosquitos are much smaller in the DR!). Bugspray stopped that!-Make sure to get yourself a shot of Mamajauna mixed fresh at the bar and a Mr. Majestic with Rum! Enjoy El Presidente!I highly recommend this hotel - I cannot wait to go back and am figuring out who to bring!

<Content>Beautiful beach/water, not a 5 star resort This was our first time to the Dominican. We have traveled the world and have stayed in all types of accommodations, but prefer the nicer type of resorts. We traveled with two teens also. Front desk check in was a nightmare. They did not have our reservations, Expedia or they screwed up. Not even our category of room was available but they made it better 2 1/2 hours later by giving us 2 rooms instead of one suite. No welcome drinks were offered, only wet towel. Resort is very pretty, beaches and water are so beautiful and clean. People at the resort were nice but not overly friendly. They were constantly painting and keeping the resort clean and spiffy. Speaking spanish is a must! Not much english understood. The food was abundant but not great. Standout were fresh fruit, anything made to order, salads, breads and desserts. The largest dining room for all meals is dark! Service was good and bad daily-no consistency. Gourmet restaurant food was o.k., service horrible and slow. Japanese food was barely edible, service was good. Steak and seafood restaurants were the best with good service of some of the best food we had all week, just not that great. Dominican restaurant we didn't touch-looked awful. We are not big drinkers and drinks were o.k., in small cups, so bring your own insulated mug if you wish. By the way, we are tippers and tipped constantly. Did it improve our service overall-NO! go figure. Entertainment was too late, inappropriate for younger kids, stupid when it came to the guests and only a few shows were watchable. They do try hard. Would I come back? No, no time soon to this island. Too many other places we've been in Mexico, Caribbean (Aruba is fantastic) would be our next choice again. Oh yeah, my one teen got very sick the 2nd day and we all felt gastro problems on the last day-something is not right in their food or water/ice. Just beware. Just go there with your eyes open, with some info from recent travelers and you should be fine.

<Content>Majestic Mick Here we are! We are having a drink at this vary moment on our last night at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana. We're in a fantastic bar located in the lobby with friends Mick from Ontario and J  A from Niagara Falls (now in Troy, USA). The drinks are the best, the food in all the restaurants was good, Le Gourmet ,Matsuri and Rodeo Grill with the Sirloin was great and shrimp. Breakfast at the buffet is very good. Stay away from the Mexican (Taino) restaurant. Most the theatre show were good. The pool was amazing - never a problem getting a lounge chair. All in all, I can't say I had a complaint. I have been to many resorts in Punta Cana and I would recommend this resort. It is a great size... not to big to have to walk forever, not to small to not offer variety.

<Content>First Class Operation The facility is magnificent. The Beach is gorgeous and very well maintained. The service was superb. The food was plentiful and provided many choices. My only negative comment regards the entertainment. It starts too late at night and having guests make fools of themselves leaves a lot to be desired. When professional entertainers perform, that was worth seeing.The guests come from all over the world and are very friendly. The atmosphere is conducive to everyone having a good time.

<Content>Wonderful Experience Arrived at the Majestic on Dec1 for a 1 week stay. Check-in was easy. Our room wasn't ready but we didn't care. We just went for lunch and toured the resort. Upon entering our room we were blown away. It was a 1 bed Colonial suite. It was on the fourth floor with an ocean and pool view. Thanks Emily.Also want to thank Mike (the former Majestic Mike). We had some confusion with our room category before our arrival. The resort had us in a basic room, instead of a 1bcs. Neither our tour operator or travel agent were willing to help sort out the confusion. Even the resort would not respond to the emails. As a last resort I contacted Mike, who in turn called Norberto (reservations manager). Everything was sorted out that same day, and everything went smooth upon our arrival.We were so impressed with Mike for helping us like that. He certainly didn't have to. I hope the Majestic realizes what a huge mistake they made by letting a great guy like that go.Food: Great. Lots to choose from. Never got sick.Service: Outstanding. The staff is the friendliest we have ever encountered. Beach: Nice. There are rocks in parts of the water, so you must be careful. Pool: Beautiful. Just like everyone says.We have never returned to the same resort. However, after our stay at Majestic, that will probably change. It really is a wonderful resort.

<Author>Pazuzu999
<Content>Great vacation overall!! Overall, the Majestic was the best A.I. resort i've stayed in. I've been to 4 and 5 star resorts in Cuba and Puerto Plata, and was my first time to PC. This is pretty lengthy so read on, and feel free to email me at irishguy876@hotmail.com if you'd like to ask me more questions. Rooms - My gf and I stayed with 2 other couples from Toronto (we're mid 30's) and ahead of time i requested building 2, second floor. George in PR (who replaced Emily) kindly accommodated me and we had excellent rooms, ours in 2205 and the others just down the hall. I recommend this part of the resort, and don't think the swim up poolside rooms would be worth the extra cash. They have jacuzzi tubs outside the room but there's obviously no privacy. We used our jacuzzi tub in our room nearly every night (after a tough day at the beach/pool!) and it was nice to have a little quiet private time in a jacuzzi bath that we could both comfortably fit in.The rooms overall were very nice, and we loved the shower! Didn't care the bathroom door was a frosted glass window.The pillows were pretty flat and the bed a bit hard but no biggie; the kingsize bed was great. Staff seemed to makeup rooms later in the day, but i guess that depends on where your room is. No problem, except for one day where i wanted to get some sleep during the day (more on that below). The resort policy seems to be that they'll only provide 2 beers per day but again, no biggie since you're at an A.I resort and there's no shortage of booze at the bars. And, if you don't use your beers up one day, hide them in your suitcase and the maid will give you two more..then put the other 2 back in the fridge and you have 4 for when you want 'em.The in room safe was great..good to see the resort not charging for this as some I've stayed at charge 20bucks for the week.We had the grey wristbands, and i wasn't sure what the difference was between these and others (pls comment or email me if you do?) but on arrival, we had fruit and champagne in the room, and on nights 2 and 3 we got bottle of wine and sushi/ fruit delivered around 5pm. After that, no more deliveries though! :(The robes and slippers were a nice touch, but one day we left the robes to be replaced and we never got new ones, but no big deal overall.Grounds - Incredibly beautiful. Immaculate. Constant attention all around the resort. In the case of any unthoughtful guests who left cups or garbage (which i simply don't understand), trash was picked up almost immediately by any/all staff constantly making rounds. Service /bars - Above average. We tipped fairly well, and each person in our group probably tipped 50 bucks each throughout the week. I just don't get people who don't tip at all - don't care if it's not custom to do so in Europe..the Majestic isn't in Europe and the staff make little wages. I found them very friendly, helpful and courteous. I also don't understand why some guests (seems to be older European folks to be honest) treat some of these people like servants. I heard many ordering drinks without saying please and thank you,etc. Can't hurt to say hola, por favor, gracias. I didn't have any problems with non English speaking staff for the most part..one night i wanted to order a Sherry but they weren't aware of the term, but the lobby bartender found me a suitable alternate (premium drink, but we didn't have to pay for it). Would be nice to have a menu of drinks to try some variations in drinks, but in some cases the various brands were displayed, including premium brands such as Stoli Vodka which I drank most of the week. In some cases the mix for drinks was flat however. Presidente beer on tap was always cold, crisp and fresh. It seems to be primarily a Canadian phenomenom but our group brought thermos containers or smaller bubba kegs - this is a must. Otherwise you'll get small glass cups where drinks get warm very quickly in the tropical sun. Bevvies stay cold and it's good for the environment. Just don't overdo it with the giant bubba kegs the size of your head. A little crass! The market shop sell the thermos thingy's at a ridiculous price so pick one up at home for 8bucks. Pool - Excellent - by far the best i've ever experienced. The layout means that it forces people to spread out, so there's not a billion people around a circular pool. I walked to the nearby bahia principe and it seemed quite congested around the pool. And, as long as you got to the pool by about 9am you could get a chair somewhere. We're not fans of excessive noise on our vay-k so we stayed clear of the main bar where the animation team was constantly getting things going. Just not our thing, and we found their yelling into the mic in between soundbytes of techno pretty annoying. There were a few staff serving drinks at your chairs around the pool tool, which was nice. You didn't have to tip, but you can guarantee that if you didn't the number of repeat visits by the staff member would decline, which I agree with. Throw the guy a buck every 2nd round - it won't kill your budget. Beach - beautiful sand, great warm water and yes, it's blue. Maybe not photoshop blue..but blue. BRING WATER SHOES. It makes your life easier. There are a few rocks under the water to step on so just save yourself a few ouchies. And don't expect a completely serene, calm bed of water folks. For us, the wavier the better - makes it fun to play around in the water. Otherwise it's just like being in a bath. Best waves seemed to be in the morning and at sunset. Was pretty windy at the beach on a couple of days, but the breeze was nice.Weather - i think the week before us it rained or was overcast most of the week, so i guess we were lucky. It was beautiful every day - on our last day it rained for about 10 minutes and that was it. But were were determined that even if the weather didn't cooperate we'd still make an effort to have fun. In fact, we swam in the rain in the pool..awesome.Excursions - we only took one, the Speedboat/snorkelling trip and it was excellent. $70 per person for 2people in a boat, or $100 per person for your own boat. Very well organized and efficient. Only ate up a half day too. Would have been nice to see a few more exotic fish in the snorkelling portion but no biggie whatsoever.Shows - umm..cheesy. As mentioned before, the animation team/nightly shows aren't our cups of tea. Our group tended to create our own party. I think this is a generational thing perhaps. Older folks may enjoy that sort of thing but we all just sort of laughed at the shows. However, if you like that kind of entertainment..then you will like the shows. Disco/Casino - Again, we created our own fun at these places. I don't gamble and it's basically a one room casino but it gave us something to do when we were revving up our evenings. Shops - don't bother as everything's overpriced, but then again, if you need something..you need something. Public bathrooms - other than an odd earthy smell (perhaps it's the resort's cleaning agent?) the bathrooms were immaculate and always beaning cleaned it seemed. And guys, at some point you'll likely go into a bathroom and need the urinal - if there's a woman in there cleaning/mopping, just proceed with your business. She's not gonna leave and she'll just ignore you so no big deal. Restaurants - Buffet was pretty good overall, and i especially liked the freshly made to order pasta. The pizza was delish too. Service to your tables in the buffet was outstanding. Constant attention to your drinks was the norm. The chinese a la carte was very good, but we decided to forego the Japanese cuz we ended up getting an early 630pm reservation (the only one available when we checked in 5 days earlier..so book a la cartes asap). The Gourmet was quite good too. Steakhouse was mediocre. I loved the Mexican/Caribbean but it could've used some tasty hot sauces! Good that they had some authentic Domincan dishes too. A nice touch. Another nice touch was a mini appetizer/drink stand just outside the main lobby bar every night. If you have food allergies be cautious because the person serving is doing just that and not an expert on all ingredients in the items being served. It was nice to have though because you could have a little appetizer and blue lagoon/punch before dinner. And oh, the late night snack bar is really quite awful so just avoid it if you can. Health issues - On day 5 i got under the weather...by my own doing. It seems i had a bit of sunstroke so i woke up nauseaus and threw up a couple of times, and the next day and a half i had absolutely no appetite. A couple of folks in our group had some minor stomache issues - but hey - it's a different country, different foods and your world has changed instantly with a lot more drinking than you're used to, along with a dramatic change in climate and activities, so it's bound to happen. Since i was up most of one night not feeling well, i was exhausted the next day and it seemed that my room wasn't going to get made up for a while so i had to try and find a quiet corner in the lobby to crash for a while on a couch. Departure day - this may not be a factor depending on when you leave, but we had our check out extended to 1:30 (instead of 12) since the bus wasn't picking us up until 630pm. For $40 you may be able to get a 6pm checkout but it was unavailable when we were leaving cuz the resort was getting filled up. No biggie though. You just stick your luggage in a waiting room (no charge) and take a shower and change in a shower/change room off the lobby. Very helpful. Airport /Transfers - they didn't have our names on the list when we were about to board our bus at the airport to take us to the resort..but we got on anyway. This delayed things by about 20 minutes as they had to arrange a private taxi for 6 others. When i got to the resort i told my Sunwing rep so it wouldn't happen on the way back..He assured me it would be no problem, but sure enough it happened again and there was another delay. It might've been an anomaly and local mixup, but they should get this straightened out really because although it's minor and they made arrangments, people just want to get to their resorts on the way in, and get out of Dodge on the way out.We found that the PC airport when we were leaving was absolute chaos. tough to get a place to sit down really, but whatever..it's still a 3rd world country and developing this type of infrastructure. So sad to see a Wendy's at the airport too. Duty free had decent prices on stuff too. And best of all, while waiting for our plane, the airport had free WIFI (or just unsecure wireless internet!) and we listened to the Leaf /Bruins game online.. a nice segue back to Canada!Oh one other thing. I know there are people visiting from all over the world, and people are proud of where they're from, but in my opinion, people should avoid blatantly wearing clothing that shouts out their country's name. The number one offender, IMHO, was Canadians (and I too am a very proud Canadian). You're on vacation AWAY from your country, so why jam where you're from down the throat of the locals and every other guest? If Americans were wearing USA shirts, it would get more heat wouldn't it? But us Canucks seem to get away with it, which i don't think is right! :) If it comes up in conversation with locals or other guests, that's fine, but lose the Canada/ Raptors/Leafs/Oilers/Roots Canada shirts..all of which i saw last week. Just my opinion..if you don't agree, that's fine too.So that's it..i think. Feel free to drop a line or question!Ryan

<Content>Rivals Sandals After spending a week in both the Sandals Royal Caribbean Resort in Montego Bay and the Majestic Colonial within the last year the latter gave a better bang for our buckThe garden view room in the Majestic was twice as large as the Sandals premium room and featured a jacuzzi tub my wife lived in! (not available at Sandals)Restaurants were fantastic never crowded and the food was varied and flavourful. A couples only Majestic owned hotel is currently under constuction next door thus increasing restaurant selections hopefully as early as next year.The pool was cleaned early each day and as a result was always blue and sparkling.Flowers and grass were watered by sprinkler system. Everything was in great shape as the gardeners were out in force trimming and shaping hedges and shrubsOur maid was observed picking fresh flowers that ended up decorating our bed and Jacuzzi edge. Beach was never crowded and a pleasure to walk and walk and walk...Staff were always smiling and minor room problems were attended to the same day. (dead bolt was sticky and hard to engage)Took the snorkelling trip on the KonTikki boat that was recommended by our Rep Eddie. The afternoon was very entertaining. The entry and exit from the large party boat was via a fibreglass row boat powered by an outboard motor. A common sight around Punta Cana. The waves were running in excess or 3-4 ft causing several anxious minutes ( my wife was terrified). The pitching motion of the smaller vessel as the dozen passengers attempted to climb and later descend a splintered ladder was not what we expected and led to a few expletives to escape our lips.Would we go back to the Majestic? Without a doubt.PS...If you use a face cloth bring one. and smile the staff will return it for sure

<Content>A wonderful resort I had us booked at another resort, but after reading reviews on TripAdvisor about that resort (i.e. smoking EVERYWHERE) I contacted our travel agent and got us booked at the Majestic. I have been to almost a dozen all-inclusives in the Caribbean now and this one was one of the very best. We arrived by way of Miami. This is fine going, but I highly advise against it for the return flight, as I will discuss later in the review. Our flight was out of Baltimore and it is a very easy trip to DR. Thanks to TripAdvisor reviews, we weren't surprised by the thatch huts that make up the airport, and we also knew to avoid/ignore the throngs of taxi drivers. We simply looked for the sign of our tour company and got our transfer to the resort. The transfer was effortless and in about 1/2 hour, we were at our resort for check-in. There were no rum punch drinks offered to us like I read about in other reviews, but we didn't care. There was a line, but it moved at a decent pace. When we checked in, there were 3 of us and 3 rooms. 2 of us had our rooms ready and it was very quick, but one of us they could not find. Not a problem as they got the manager in a few Dominican minutes and he got a room for the third person. Be warned - of all the places I've been, the ability of the locals to speak English here is the worst. I highly suggest a phrase book or some translation software for your PDA if you want to have any real hope of communicating with the vast majority of the staff. We always got by and we all laughed as we tried to understand eachother, but I can imagine that if you ever had a real issue or problem in this country, the language barrier would be a significant hurdle. The grounds and the resort are exactly as pictured. The rooms are amazing and just like the pictures. We requested upgrades, but as the resort was booked, we didn't get them. No worries. The standard rooms were great. And even though it says on their website that room service is only included with the upgraded rooms, we had room service each morning for our meetings and there was no charge. No problems with electricity (the outlets look wierd, but are fine for our gadgets) plenty of hot water, toilets worked great. The rooms are entirely marble and wood. Very beautiful. We could not get the cable internet in the rooms to work for us, but the wireless in the lobby worked great and was very fast. There is an internet cafe up past the casino and it charges $5 per 1/2 hour and you get a code so what you don't use one day, you can use another. 2 of us were in building 3 looking out into the gardens and a third was in building 1 looking out at the neighboring resort. All of us were happy. I could see where building 4 might not have been great as there is much construction along that side of the resort. The pool is just spectacular and really is the crown jewel of this resort. It spans the entire length of the resort. There is an area for activities and then areas of quiet. Although the activities on the beach in the morning disturb the quiet of the one end of the pool, it is over in about 1 hour and after that, it's pretty quiet. The resort itself is a nice size. Not too big, not too small. I hope that doesn't change after the completion of the construction. I've been to monster resorts where you had to get golf carts to get from one part to another, but this one isn't like that. I saw quite a few handicapped persons at this resort and I wonder if this might be due to the size and the plentiful elevators. It is very well suited to wheelchairs and crutches. The food was the best all-inclusive food I've ever had. Understand that all-inclusive resort food is RARELY 5-star cuisine. The sheer volume of the food that has to be prepared each day just makes it impossible that the food is gourmet. But this resort had a great amount of diversity at all restaurants so even picky children would find something. Try the chocolate cake. I've rarely ever found deserts in the Caribbean to be good, but the chocolate cake was fabulous. The main buffet is a huge dining hall. A bit noisy. The beach resaurant was very good and had a great variety to choose from. Very few bugs anywhere. Did get bit a couple times sitting out on the balcony after sunset, but not sure by what because I never felt them or heard them. We didn't do the nightlife. We were on a corporate retreat so after working all morning and then enjoying the sun all afternoon, we were pretty tired at the end of the day. The specialty restaurants are good. We had no problem with reservations. The people are very friendly, but I noticed that in this country, you generally must make the first move. And I also noticed that they seem to mirror the attitude that you have when you make the first move. I made a conscious effort to be very happy and upbeat to everyone of the staff and that was exactly the attitude that I got in return. Consequently, I also took a lot of time and watched people and saw that those who were grouch in the morning, or who spoke to them with disrespect, got the same in return. Dominicans are a hard working and proud people, so be sure to appreciate that and show that appreciation and you will be rewarded. I was appalled by how some of the customers spoke to the staff and found it hard on several occassions not to say something. And I found it to be across the nationalities and not just the Ugly American. The nice thing about this resort is that there did seem to be little riff-raff. I've been to some resorts where it seemed like every freak in a trailer park who could scrape together $599 was there. This isn't one of those places (yet). At the prices in the Dominican, I'm surprised there isn't more of a Greyhound bus feel, but so far, so good. Another nice thing is that smoking is not allowed in certain areas, so if you are like me and get headaches or upset stomach from second hand smoke, you won't be bothered by it. The beach is beautiful but the surf when we were there was quite rough. Don't know if that is a regular thing, but I prefer the more shallow and placid Caribbean waters. There was even a strong undertow, so be careful if you are traveling with little ones. We went scuba diving one day. Somewhat disappointing. The visability wasn't great, but even if it was, there wasn't much to see. It was brown and dead as far as coral went. The fish were beautiful, but nothing spectacular. The dive boat is basically just a dinghy. Getting back into the boat, especially with big swells and rought seas was very difficult. One of us has bad shoulders so getting back into the boat was almost impossible. We did see a HUGE eel and that was a great experience. But we only went on one dive since we just weren't impressed with the first experience. We didn't do any of the organized excursions off the resort, but I did speak to a gentleman and his 12 year old son. They had done the dune buggy trip. They really enjoyed it and the 12 year-old especially enjoyed the 4 layers of mud he had encrusted on himself when he got back!! One of us got a killer massage in the spa. He just raved about Juana and how good her massage was. He said it was the best of his life. Based on his recommendation, I would suggest asking for Juana by name if you want a great massage. Be sure to take some 1's or 2's for tips. The staff at this resort are very hard working and certainly deserve it. The minibar has a 2 beer per day limit, but I just left a note that said 4 mas cervasas, por favor and a couple dollars and I always got what I wanted. The beds are very firm. If you are used to a soft pillow top mattress, you are probably going to end the week with a stiff back. We drank the water, ate salads, fruit, etc. One of us got an upset stomach one night, but we don't really think that had anything to do with the food since we all ate and drank the same stuff and he was the only one who got an upset stomach. I had an upset stomach one night too, but I think that was because I had a few too many pina coladas in the pool! Victor at the swimup bar is great and he keeps the drinks coming. Be sure to take a floaty if you like them since they are $13 in the gift shop. And be sure to take an insulated mug since the drinks (alcoholic and non) come in little 6/8 oz cups and the mugs in the gift shop are $12. We have Verizon cell phones and had no problems receiving or making calls. You don't have to dial a country code, just dial normally with the 1 and then the area code. And we even were able to send and receive email on our cell phones too. We did have a problem with reception in certain places. In our rooms, the reception was terrible (maybe because of all the marble and concrete) but out in the open or on our balcony there was no problem. Oh, one last thing; try NOT to have a layover in Miami!!!! I don't know if it is this way everywhere, but we had to go through customs and immigration (which was fine) but once you do that, you then have to go through security ALL OVER AGAIN!!!! When you are tired and hungry, this isn't exactly a welcome surprise. I have no idea why we had to do that since we had already been through security in the Dominican and the customs and immigration areas were highly secure. From now on, it's direct flights for me!!! Well, I think that is everything. Our trip was exactly what we expected thanks to the advice we got on TripAdvisor so I hope that this review helps someone else.

<Content>Wedding-Beautiful! Resort-Beautiful! Food-SoSo! We stayed at the Majestic from Nov 22-29. The reason we went was for our wedding. We chose the Majestic based on the great ratings, price, and accomodations. Here are a few pros and cons about the resort. Hopefully this helps others when choosing a resort. Also, feel free to contact me if you are planning your wedding at the Majestic and want info.There were 25 people in our group and overall, the resort did a good job of accomodating everyone. The grounds are absolutely amazing. The staff does a great job of keeping the landscaping trimmed neatly and everything is beautiful. The pool area and beach areas are cleaned daily. The weather was great-a bit windy, but warm enough and not too much rain. Room: We were given an upgraded room because we booked our wedding there. We had 2250, 1st floor at the very end of building 2. Our view was poolside, partial ocean. The patio included a tub (which was only used once). The location of this room is not so private. Because the room was on the end of the building, there was a walkway that many people used to go from the beach/pool to building 2. That would be my only complaint with the patio...not a big deal, but not very secluded and private if you are looking for that. Maybe ask for a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor? The room did have a musty smell, but I think it was due to the ocean being nearby and the humidity. The room was clean, however it could use a little polishing. The mirror was dirty and the ceiling/walls appeared as though they could use a good scrubbing. Still not really a big deal. The minifridge is tiny. There is enough room in it for a few bottled beers, bottled water and sodas and that's about it. The in-room safe came in very handy, as we kept all of our valuables and money in there and didn't worry about a thing while we were out during the day. Housekeeping seemed to come clean the room at a later time in the day (usually around 4pm). If it were up to me, I would have preferred to have the room cleaned earlier. As sometimes we would spend a little time in our room in the middle of the day and needed clean towels. The bathroom issue that many people have with the resort was not an issue for us. We didn't mind it at all. I guess if you are sharing a room with someone you don't know very well this might be a problem. The bathroom area is not completely private. The bed was not great. Not terrible, but not great. It's hard and the sheets felt wet due to the humidity. But if you are tired enough everyday from being in the sun, this doesn't matter that much..you just get used to it.Food: Probably the lowest on my list of cons. The food is just so-so. Everything is bland and maybe slightly underdone to my liking. And while there is a lot to choose from, after a few days you realize the variety isn't there so much. The breakfast in the main buffet was the best meal, in my opinion. I always made it to breakfast everyday! We tried every restaurant except for the Japanese-Hibatchi table. The Japanese restaurant is open without reservations, where they have a select menu and a sushi buffet bar. But in order to eat at the Hibatchi table you have to make a reservation. There are only 3 of these tables with 10 seats each. They have 3 seatings a night (6:30, 8:00 and 9:30pm). They fill up quick. I would suggest making a reservation the day you get there, as they are usually booked solid during the first 3-4 days of your stay. The other restaurant that requires a reservation is the French restaurant, Le Gourmet. It turned out to be my favorite. The beef tenderloin there was very good. The main buffet serves a decent breakfast, but the rest of the meals served there leave you with much to desire. The mexican restaurant, El Taino was not very good. The seafood restaurant, Tres Carabelas, was OK...the dinner menus at all the restaurants are very select..so there's not a lot to choose from. Again, the food in general was probably the biggest disappointment for me. But it didn't ruin my whole trip by any means!The wedding: We chose the gazebo location with a private reception dinner/dancing at the parrots bar afterwards. The wedding ceremony was wonderful...everything was decorated beautifully, completely handled by the staff. Other than picking out my flowers and music, I didn't have much to do with the planning. Larissa, the wedding coordaintor on site is somewhat difficult to deal with, but in the end she did a good job of putting everything together nicely. The reception was fantastic. If you plan to marry here and are debating on whether to spend the extra money for a private reception, DO IT! It was totally worth it. We had our own music, our own staff-bar tenders and waiters. We chose the BBQ buffet for our dinner. The selection was nice..soups, grilled fish, chicken, lobster, beef, potatoes, salad, broccoli and mushrooms and a variety of desserts. The wedding cake was also nice and pretty good. Our guests really enjoyed everything, as did we. The photography wasn't that great and in my opinion, if you can afford it, I'd hire your own and pay their way down there or work out soem kind of deal. Our photographer barely spoke english and had us in akward poses we ddin't like. With our package price of $550 we received a cd of 50 pictures. If we wanted the other 57 photos that were taken they offered them to us a $8 a photo! I guess for us it was easy to decline because none of the photos were that great that we wanted to pay for the additionals. Oh well, thankfully all of our guests brought cameras and we have plenty of non-professional photos to frame.Would I go back? Probably not..but mostly because there are plenty of other places I want to see and visit. :) Hope this review was helpful for those who are considering a vacation or wedding at the Majestic Colonial.

<Content>Beach is awesome We just got back from six days at rhe Majestic. I had been there last year and loved it. Was just as good the second time. The facilities are clean and beautiful. The food is very good for an all-inclusive resort. The sushi was quite good and the fresh fish at Tres Carabelas was delisioso. The staff was very friendly. Denny, our beach concierge, was so kind and helpful. And the beach is incomparable to any that we've seen in the caribbean.

<Content>Extremely enjoyable, great value! Bethesda, MD. We stayed at the Majestic Colonial from November 14 through November 18th and had a wonderful time. We read many reviews on Tripadvisor rating it a 5 and have concluded we were getting very good guidance on this resort! This was our first all-inclusive vacation, so we weren't sure what to expect. We went here to relax, get a tan, drink and eat well, all of which we did to our satisfaction. Staff was friendly, our room was upscale and comfortable, beach was beautiful, food was abundant and always available, mixed drinks were decent brands and readily available, and the grounds and pool were beautiful. They provided beach towels, there were plenty of beach chairs and the beach was clean. People would bring you drinks on the beach or you could just go up to the bar that was right there. Included in the price was use of snorkel gear, wake boards, windsurfing and sailboats. To be balanced, the food was fine with plenty of variety from steak to lobster to everything in between, but I wouldn't call it 5-star - and didn't expect it to be because IT'S AN ALL INCLUSIVE! We read that the South side of the property overlooking the construction site got noisy during the day (confirmed) and therefore we paid extra to stay in a ground floor unit with an ocean view. We left daily $2 tips for the cleaning staff and similar tips for the food and bar servers, which they seemed to appreciate. Other than the tips (which aren't required) we didn't need to spend any money and had a great time. We returned home feeling relaxed and that we got a great value for the price. We would go back again and would definitely recommend the Majestic to others.

<Content>Paradise Found This is the most beautiful place my wife and I ever stayed at. The architecture is exquisite and the grounds are absolutely wonderful with Palm trees everywhere and flowers at every turn. We enjoyed the beach (which was cleaned early every day of our stay). There were more then enough chairs for all guests and plenty of room to walk around the chairs. There was no issue of towels going missing as my wife and I went into the ocean multiple times and the towels were left alone.We felt perfectly safe at the resort.There was a pleasant constant breeze that was needed in the heat of the tropics. When rains or the wind would pick up they dropped sheets like sails over openings that looked magnificent and made a difference and added to the overall look of the resort.The room was absolutely beautiful. We had the standard junior suite which included a 4 poster bed and jacuzzi tub with jets. Very romantic especially with the complimentary bottle of champagne. We had a great variety of food among the many restaurants of the resort. There was the French restaurant with a fantastic Pumpkin-Coconut soup. The Carribean Restaurant had a traditional Goat stew that was delicious. We would especialy like to acknowledge the following staff who provided us with excellent customer service with a personal touch:Denny - Beach ConsonsiegeLeyda - Main BuffetFrancisco - Beach Hut RestaurantAll in all we had a wonderful time and would definitely go back again. A true 5 star resort.

<Content>They forget to tell you a few things...... I have just returned from a week away in the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. I had read the previous reviews and wished someone had said something about the building site on one side of the hotel (this will be another hotel Majectic Elegance which will be ready next year late 2008). Just one more small complaint the bathroom is in the bedroom literally鈥?the photo of the woman in the bath with a man standing by in a bathrobe鈥?the toilet is right beside this with a small half door of frosted glass. If you鈥檙e a wee bit shy of sharing those intimate moments with your partner then I would suggest upgrading the room, it can be very unromantic! The staff are wonderful and when we asked to move rooms we had to wait till the next day but did get moved to room overlooking car park the next day, but this was fine with us beach and pool side are lovely instead. The barmen keep your drinks well topped up for the rest of your holiday if you give them a small tip. They don鈥檛 get paid much and work so hard so please tip. When you enter Dominican republic you pay $10 and when you leave you pay $20 make sure you have some cash to hand left for this. We did not spend any money on holiday really because we only left hotel once for the week we where there. We went horse riding which was good fun, make sure you know how to ride before hand though these are not riding lessons! Got fantastic coffee at a ladies house in the mountains the locals are so lovely.If you are looking for a holiday that you sit by the pool and drink has much as you want then this is the holiday for you. If you looking for adventure then this is not the place to go. I hope you enjoy!

<Content>#l Staff at the Majestic My Mom and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana the week of Nov 16th. I cannot say enough about this property. It is a true gem of a resort. The staff are second to none and are very accommodating. All of the staff are very happy and egar to please. I would definiately recommend this resort and will be returning, for two weeks the next time. The restaurants are wonderful with great food selections. The resort is very beautifuland clean. A huge thank you to Denny our beach concierge; who was always there to replace our towel or deliver one of many wonderful drinks made by the outstanding bar staff. Our breakfast, lunch and dinner waiters were all wonderful and a lot of fun. A big thank you to Guests Services and the Gourmet Restaurant for making my Mom's birthday extra special. All of the bartenders are outstanding and a big thank you to them also! The ANIMATION TEAM are the best I have ever seen. They are a lot of fun, very outgoing, very happy and work extremely hard to make sure everyone is having a great time and enjoying their vaction to the fullest. The Animation shows at night are top notch and are always full. A huge hug and thank you to: Kiko, Arelis, Miguel, Sandy, Jimmy - all of the Animation Team!!!!! I truely cannot say enough about this resort. The Management Team at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana should be very proud and honoured to have such fantastic staff. The Majestic Colonial and all of the employees truely know what a resort and great customer service is all about!!!! Cannot wait to return. Laura.

<Content>best resort ever All I can say is WOW!! The resort was absolutely beautiful. The whole place is exactly as beautiful as the website describes. The staff is sooooo wonderful. You don't ever get a chance for your glass to go empty no matter what you're drinking they are right there to fill it to the brim. The rooms are the most beautiful we have ever stayed in. I do have to say the pillows are not good and the bed kind of hard but otherwise it was great, the room comes with robes, slippers, alcohol and a fully stocked mini bar. As to the bathroom, i have some privacy issues and i had no problem with the bathroom so ignore the negative reviews on this website.The food is pretty good if you stay with the restaurants, especially the seafood and steak house. Who can argue with unlimited lobster. The buffet wasn't so great but it's a buffet so what can youexpect. We have traveled to many resorts in many Carribean countries and never have i been able to snorkle right at the beach at the resort. We didn't need to leave the property at all.It was a truly wonderful vacation. I have to say that i have always told my husband i wouldn't revisit a country until I had been to them all but we are already planning a return visit to Majestic Colonial Punta Cana with the kids in the next few months and there are MANY countries we haven't visited yet. So remember ignore the occasional bad review on this website because thosepeople must be impossible to please. Go to Majestic Colonial Punta Cana and you will not be sorry, but do what i did after reading all the reviews and pack some pillows and you too will have no complaints. Happy Traveling Elaine

<Content>Majestic Colonial Beautiful with great people We returned from the Majestic on November 20th and I am finally getting around to my review. We were at the Majestic during the supposed food poisoning time. We did not experience any problems with stomach illness, other than the cause of having a little too much fun the night before. We also met quite a few others and never once heard about anyone with food poisoning. I have to admit it took me a bit to get used to the food and know what I should and should not eat. As many others have said you just need to know your own stomach and what it can take. The steak house was a great place to eat. I loved the filet mignon and the Caesar salad. The service here was very good. Our glasses both water and wine were always full. The only other place that we ate was the buffet. The best time to go there is right after it opens. We found this true for both lunch and dinner. I don鈥檛 recommend the beach restaurant for either breakfast or lunch the selection was not as big as the main buffet. We did have some occasions where we had to grab someone鈥檚 attention to get water refilled or tea in the morning, but it was not a big deal.Our room was 2246 which I requested from Emily before we arrived and she was nice enough to accommodate us. The view from this room is incredible. We overlooked the pool right by the swimup bar and had a view of the ocean. When the sliding door was open you could hear the music from the bar but when it was closed it was totally silent. We had a problem with a leak in the ceiling above the Jacuzzi, we called it in and someone was up there within minutes and got it fixed. That was the only problem that we encountered. Our room did have a musty smell to it and unfortunately I forgot the air freshener but we eventually got used to it. I highly recommend bringing one just in case. We asked for extra pillows and received them without a problem. I slept fine in the beds and the air conditioning was plenty cool. Our room was cleaned perfectly each day and our wet bar filled. We tipped both the maid and the man that filled the wet bet bar each day as well as leaving them little gifts now and then. Whenever we met up with them they smiled and offered a big thank you for both. The maid came early a couple days but found that I enjoy sleeping so our room was cleaned in the afternoon and was ready for us when returned from our day at the pool. My favorite part of the room was the shower. It was so big and the water pressure was great. The small toilet are did not bother me at all although my husband bumped hi arm a couple times but only complained about it once. This room is on the ocean end so you do have a walk to the lobby and the buffet but it was good exercise.We went to both the Michael Jackson show and the Ultimate couple show. Both were good. The couple show was really funny, they take people from the audience and they compete against each other. The service in the theater was great. We had barely sat down and someone was there taking our drink order. After the Michael Jackson show we went to the disco where we had a great time. There were lots of people and good music. I heard a lot of people during the week saying how much fun they had at the disco. The animation team comes there after the show and really helps getting the crowd into it. Now that I have mentioned the animation team I have to say that they were the best part of our vacation. They were at the pool every day at 10 and then again at 4 and full of enthusiasm. I read so many reviews with people raving about the animation team and really never thought that I would feel the same. We have been to Mexico and the entertainment team there really wasn鈥檛 anything to brag about. This group is just wonderful. They created games each day and got people involved. They really encouraged people to participate which was good because it was a good way to meet people. We had a lot of fun with all of them and really appreciate all of there hard work and their great personalities. I could not get over how hard and how long they work each day. Like I said before they arrived at the pool at 10 and them were at the disco which opens at 11 and I鈥檓 not sure what time they left but it was late. We really got to know Miguel, Pablo and Jesus. We had the pleasure of teaching Pablo how to play cribbage. We want all of them to know how much we appreciated their friendship while we were there. In my opinion the animation team made the resort. As others say you can not say enough about them.We would also like to say that the bar staff was great at all of the bars we went to. During the day our bar was the pool bar with Ernesto, Rosa and Ismael (?sp). There were all very friendly and greeted us each day with a smile and great service. At night we went to the lower lobby bar where we met Pablo and Francis (a.k.a. Spiderman) We really got to know Pablo, he was my man for making a mean dirty martini and always kept the mamajuana coming for my husband. Pablo was able to chat with people from many different countries. He made it a point to learn some part of the language. Meeting him was best part of our trip, it was sad saying goodbye. The upper lobby bar was also a good place to go and there you can meet Freddy another wonderful person. We had great service at all of the bars that we went to. They get very busy and you may have to wait a bit for your drink but remember you are on vacation.Well I think I have said everything that I can. I definitely recommend this resort. If you go there with a positive attitude and take the good with the bad you will have a great time. One thing I forgot to mention we walked to the market on the beach. It is quite far, we guessed 1 陆 - 2 miles each way. It is a nice walk and you get to see a bunch of resorts on the way. The market had some good things and the people were not rude at all. Be prepared to bargain though. Everything started at $65 US for me.Thanks for a great time.Kim and Gary (Mr Andrea Agassi as Miguel dubbed him)

<Content>alot of good and alot of bad My husband, our 2 kids (7 and8) and I stayed at the Majestic from 11/20-11/27. The good: The hotel is beautiful, very well kept. very grand. the beach was awesome. The weather was great. The rooms are just like the pics. The price was very reasonable. The breakfast buffet was great also. One of the best parts of our stay was the experience with the kids club and Maggie and Maria. THey were awesome we liked them so much as did the kids. They were very attentive and were wonderful to all the kids the whole time. My husband and I were able to spend a little time alone everyday beacuse we felt very comfortable leaving the kids with these 2 great ladies, Thanks amigas! Keep up the good work. The bad: Extremly musty smell in the room and everything seemed to be moist from humidity including the matresses. We were 2 adults and 2 kids so we needed 4 towels everyday. I had to keep asking everday for more towels and I didn't always get them. I requested to have the room cleaned in the morning, because the kids can't stay in the sun all day and we wanted to shower them mid day. the room was only cleaned at that time twice out of our seven day stay. most of the time we reused our towels and the room got cleaned around 4 pm. The worst thing is that somebody came into our room and stole a pair of my husbands shorts. I don't know why, they were very average, but he had them in his hand to wear and then he changed his mind and left them on his suitcase. The next morning he went to put them on and they were gone. We searched high and low and never found them, I then remembered the review that someone had their laptop stolen, so for the rest of the trip I did not leave my camera and camcorder in the room at all. I kept checking our clothes too. We never ended up complaining b/c we didn't think it would amount to much as we had no proof. So we just tried to forget about it. apart from the 2 ladies at the kids club the reat of the staff was extremely inconsistant. The beach has absolutely no service at all. Some employees were graet most were not

<Content>My Majestic Vacation... I stayed with my boyfriend at the Majestic from November 18 to 25. I chose this hotel over many other 5 star hotels because of its very positive reviews and so I was willing to pay a little extra.Overall, I was happy with our vacation. The hotel itself is just beautiful and very well kept. At night it looks even nicer with all the lighting. The rooms look exactly like on the pictures on the hotel's website. We were lucky to have a nice view of the pool from our balcony. I didn't find the room smelt funny or anything. When we arrived however, they initially gave us a room with two queen beds although I'm not sure why because they had another room a few doors down available with a King size bed - but they let us switch no problem.Beach was great too. When my boyfriend and I went for walks down the beach some of the hotel's beaches weren't as clean as ours so we were happy with our beach.Staff was very friendly, but it is true that the ladies that work at the casino look depressed! They just refuse to smile but we had a regular poker lady named Luchy who after a few days got to know the regulars and seemed to have a good time with us.The evening shows were very entertaining and fun to watch every night at 10:00 pm in the theatre.My only complaints with this hotel are 1- the food which I found to be MEDIOCRE. The 2 restaurants which you have to make reservations for (Le Gourmet and the Japanese Matsuri one) were pretty good. The rest were ALRIGHT. I know I can't expect too much because it's the Dominican and it's a very poor country but I was hoping it would be a little better than it was. 2 - the drinks weren't very good. They either just didn't taste like they were supposed to or were watered down. It was pretty much all their domestic stuff, nothing I've seen or tasted before. So when we drank we took shots instead. They had some familiar alcohol at the casino that I saw like Smirnoff and Grey Goose but you had to pay extra for those. And finally 3 - we just got devoured by mosquitos or SOMETHING in our room at night. I was covered in literally 28 bumps that I could count on my body and they were itchy as hell!Overall, I think this hotel is a 4 out 5. It's a wonderful hotel and we had lots of fun. No regrets booking this hotel.

<Content>Loved the Majestic We stayed at the Majestic Nov. 14th for 6 nights. There were 4 couples traveling all in our early 30鈥檚. I personally LOVED the Majestic and Punta Cana. I have been to Jamaica (Sandals Montego Bay  Ocho Rios), Riviera Maya (Royal Porto Real) and Cancun (Crown Paradise Club, Barcelo Tucancun) and I would have to say with the exception of Sandals Montego Bay this was my favorite. The resort was excellent for the price! We stayed in room 2145 and it was great! It was wonderful to have so many restaurants to choose from and I thought the food was good-none of us starved! Sure it is a little different from home, but it is anywhere you go outside the US. I will say that 2 people in our group got really sick, however I am unsure what it was that made them sick, because we all ate the same stuff. However, that can happen at home too! We used common sense and ate what we knew! The drinks were great, some reviews complained of not enough alcohol, but that was never a problem for us (and we are all drinkers)!The staff was incredible. Some complained they didn鈥檛 think they were very friendly but I think much of it has to do with they do not understand English very well. Some of the staff that really made an impression with us were: Denny-the beach waiter, Pablo at the Lobby Bar-he was awesome, Roberto at the bar by the beach, Victor from the swim up bar and the Entertainment Team (Keko, Jimmy, and Miguel)鈥攖hose guys are so much fun!!! I will say that unlike other resorts we have been to-tipping was appreciated but did not seem to make that much of a difference with regards to service. However, these people work hard, so make sure and tip them well.The beach was the most beautiful beach I have ever been to. There were tons of places to sit in the shade or the sun. The pool was fantastic too, never had to fight for a poolside chair. I loved that the water was not so rough like Mexico. I do wish there would have been more for kids to do, I would LOVE to return with my kids, but I am not sure they would have as much fun as I would, given there is not tons for them to do (8  10 years old). The guys booked an ATV tour from the hut set up by the pool and they had a really great time. The disco was fun and our friend did pretty well at the casino. The weather was really rainy while we were there but that is nobody鈥檚 fault and we made the best of it.I would definitely return! For those of you contemplating, I would say put your worries aside and book it! We got a great deal from beachdestination.com, we worked with JoAnn Ramsey and they were several hundred lower than anything else I could find. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions!

<Content>Average Majestic We stayed at the Majestic from 1st November for 2 weeks. My first impression of the hotel was that it looked lovely. Upon entering the room, there was a very musty smell, the rooms are large and bright but I thought they were quite ordinary.The food at the hotel is mediocre - the japanese was very good, and the pasta and salads were very nice, but after 2 weeks of mainly eating pasta we were ready for a change, of note we were not sick once!The beach is the best part of this hotel - the sea is a gorgeous turquoise colour and crystal clear.The hotel was extremely busy whilst we were there and the beach was crowded, hoards of people walking up and down - it was like being in Benidorm mid summer!We found the staff mainly very friendly apart from the bartenders who were very surly!I dont think we would go back to this hotel or DR, it just didnt live up to expectations. The other caribbean islands I have visited were much better in the fact that once you go out of your hotel in DR its a complete mess everywhere, the roads are terrible, and nothing seems finished. With so much investment in new hotels along that strech of beach why havent they sorted out the roads etc?We did enjoy ourselves but have definately experienced better hotels in the caribbean.

<Content>Majestic was beautiful...service just OK My girlfriend and I just returned from a stay at the Majestic (17th-24th) and the trip was pleasant overall. I do have a few pro's and con's about the hotel and DR. I would give it a rating of 3.5 if I could.GroundsVery nice and clean. The resort itself is beautiful with a ton to offer. Feels very new and is designed well. The lobby and bar areas are stunning.Room The room was designed well but was musty. It was kept clean but always had a musty smell. The separate bath and shower was nice. Overall the room was good (spent most time outside anyway). Bed was hard but big. PoolSimply Amazing and very well kept.BeachPlenty of chairs, nice sand. Lack of drink service on beach. Food Pretty good in general but nothing amazing. A lot of variety with minimal crowding. Steakhouse was our favorite. They need to keep the Buffet food hotter.DrinksBar Tenders were nice. Seemed to be skimpy on the liqour unless you asked for more. The beer was pretty good. White wine was bad. Red was OK. Beer in room is nice. I would bring a mug because the cups are kiddie style :)ServiceThe service was very inconsistent across the board. The staff was nice in general but did not seem to go out of their way consistently. From reading reviews, it seems that service has slipped. This is one area that needs to be improved or they will lose the #1 ranking.On Site ShoppingVery overpriced on grounds. One night, the hotel let outside vendors come in to sell on the grounds. This was a bad experience for my girlfriend and I. The were VERY pushy and wouldnt stop touching and pulling us. It was tacky for the resort to allow this because we had to walk by them to get to dinner. CasinoWas kind of a joke. I wouldn鈥檛 trust the slots. It would have been nice to have an organized poker tournament because the hold em table seemed to be empty often.Dominican Republic (Unrelated to Hotel)I fell like their government is pushing a bit too hard on the tourists. The entry fee is very odd but the most frustrating was this crazy 16% tax on credit card transactions. Overall the Majestic was nice and I would recommend considering it.

<Content>Incredibly Majestic We are a couple in our mid 20s who travelled to Punta Cana Nov 18-25. I have been to Punta Cana before and loved it which is why we returned. I read all the reviews on this website and chose the Majestic Colonial based on that and we were not dissapointed.FLIGHTWe booked through selloffvacations and had a Sunwing Holiday. We flew zoom airlines to Punta cana leaving at 10 am. The flight was long and we pre booked our seats so that we could have 6 extra inches of leg room which was well worth it. The service and food was good. AIRPORTWe arrived in Punta Cana at 7 pm at night. We were the only plane to arrive at that time so going through the airport was quick in easy. We quickly got our bags and hopped a cab to the resort. I didn't want to wait for the bus to fill up. This was easier for us. The price was $40. ARRIVALWe received our cold towel and went to the registration desk. Prior to arriving I contacted Majestic Emely to upgrade to a colonial jr suite. They said that they didn't have any availability and gave us a standard room instead. We were handed English passports with two room keys, a 5 dollar voucher to the casino, and a spa brouchere.ROOMSWe were lead to room #2222 - it was breathtaking. Awaiting us was a bottle of champagne, cheese tray, and fruit tray. The room is amazing. The shower can fit ten people! 4 poster king size bed and 2 person jacuzzi. We had an incredible view of the pool and a bit of a sea view. You also have your two yellow beach towels awaiting you in your room. You trade these in for cards at the end of your stay.BEACHINCREDIBLE!! White sand, no rocks, warm water. There are fun waves! one day the waves were HUGE! We boogie boarded and had a lot of fun:) There are maybe 2 rocks in the sea otherwise the water is clear. It is beautiful. It could be a little windy but otherwise, it was great. One day we walked probably 12 km down the beach (to the west). We walked past a market and all the way to the town of Corticeito (spelling?) and went to the supermercado there. I love how you can walk the beach for miles. It was great. POOLBreathtaking. You can walk for miles it seems. Great swim up bar where are the activities are. There is a a hot tub in the spa. The pool is warm and an average of 3'9 deep. BARSThere are bars everywhere. One beach bar that is in the La Hispanola restaurant. There is 2 amoung the pool area and one before the lobby where a band performs every night. There is on in the lobby which is beautiful, one by the registration desk, one in the theatre and of course in the disco and casino. Always able to get drinks to matter what. The champagne was all inclusive as well as the as much beer as you could drink. Some premium brands were available such as smirnoff vodka or canadian club. The service was good. FOOD The food was overall okay. I had some tummy trouble a couple of days before going but I have a sensitive stomach. Definitly go to the Tapanyaki restaurant. The food there is incredible. I loved the warm crousants, banana milkshakes, made to order crepes and the fresh squeezed OJ at the morning buffett. I loved the pizza at the lunch buffet. The Pumpkin soup at le gourmet was great and the chauteubriand at the rodeo steakhouse was wonderful. DRINKSReally good! The frozen lemonade is great with vodka or rum. The dirty monkey tastes like a chocolate banana milkshake made with rum. The champagne is good:) Also, go to the lobby bar and try the Pablo special! The majestic cocktail tastes like an orange creamsickle! Overall the drinks were excellent. I read a review earlier that you couldn't get bottle of champagne to your room. We only had to buy one bottle and it was because it was above premium. Otherwise, we just went to the disco and were given a bottle of the Rothenburg champagne and two glasses whenever we wanted. We had many a beautiful evening on the beach with that. Just be friendly and nice to these great people and they will treat you really well. We never had a problem getting a bottle of champagne and we got many.ENTERTAINMENTAwesome. The animation team work hard to entertain everyone. The shows were very good. Sunday was Micheal Jackson and it was excellent. They actually do the thriller dance dressed as zombies! Awesome. Monday was ideal couple where they get couples from the audience do fun games to be named the Ideal couple. Tuesday was the Circus show with fire throwers, trapeze acts and all kinds of gymnastics. It was amazing. Wednesday was Miss Majestic. They pulled a bunch of women from the audience to compete to get the title. Thursday was the 70/80s rewind. A dance troupe is in and does the show. It was really good. Friday was Men vs Women. Another audience participation show. Saturday was the international show where a dance troupe comes in and does dances from all over the world. It too was quite good. The animation staff head to the disco after to get people to do the Taki- taki dance. Its fun. The disco was pretty good and there were a few people in there right after the show then it would quiet down. It's open till 6 am.  CASINOWe were there every night and they were pretty fair. The dealers are good and understand the games. Bar service is great too. Anna is the cooler so watch out for her:) EXCURSIONSWe made our own one day when we walked to Corticeito and then cabbed to the Hard Rock Cafe. Food there was okay but we got some goodies. There is a high priced shopping centre there as well. Better off going to the mini mart at the resort.We also did the Marinarium tour. Its a half day one where you go snorkelling, swim with sharks and sting rays and then hit up a natural pool. At first it was a bit chaotic and frustrating. Snorkelling with the nurse sharks was surreal! Really awesome experience. The natural pool is the most beautiful thing i have ever seen. It was incredible. They really worked hard on the boat to entertain. SHOPPINGThere is a market about 30 minutes down the west beach. There is a lot of bartering needed for that. There is a mini mart and a bunch of shops in the resort. I found it easier to just shop there. I hate bartering. They have everything but it is true about the little conviences we might forget at home. It is quite expensive. the suntan lotion is $15 USD. WEATHEROverall it was great. We had two hours of rain one morning then it was beautiful. We had half an hour one after noon and one day of cloudy/ rainy weather. Overall it was really good.OverallWe had an amazing vacation. we met a lot of great people from all over and found the dominican people to be incredible. This hotel is truly a 5 star. The service was amazing and the hotel itself incredible. We would return in a heartbeat! LITTLE POINTS*you can book a professional photography session for FREE. They follow you around for 2 hours and take pictures of you all over the resort in different poses. It then costs $8 a photo to get them put on a CD or $10 for 8x10s. They took 175 pics of us and offered us all of them on a cd with 5x7 copies for $800. *The service at the steak/ seafood restaurant isn't the best.*spa is wonderful. The average cost for a massage is $80 USD*there is a bank machine in the front lobby that hands out pesos only. It is on average 30 pesos to $1 *I do not believe that the room upgrades are worth it. The swim up rooms are not private enough to use the jacuzzi.* Building 2 is the best. You get beautiful views of the pool* NOT a great place for singles. A lot of couples here. We met a couple of singles there with weddings but they had a hard time meeting people.*there are about two weddings a day but they looked beautiful*we tried to get late check out as we didn鈥檛 leave till 930 at night but it was not available. They had our stuff put in a room beside the front desk and they have many shower rooms available to use as well. They let us keep our towel cards for the beach and we never turned them back in. They told us not to worry about it. This place is incredible and my third all inclusive. I would return in heartbeat:)

<Content>Not Majestic.........at all We went to the Majestic for my brothers wedding. Apart from the wedding the trip was a bust. 36 people went and more than half of us got sick and stayed sick the entire time (we named it DR butt). In fact, I have been home a week and my intestines are still cramping. Aside from the medicore food and the cheap liquor, we were ripped off by hotel staff members. Here's the scam. If you go to the tour desk before there are tour operators are there (before 9:00 am) a hotel staff member complete with (picture) ID, receipt book and guest list and uniform will approach you about an excursion and take your deposit, even tell you where to wait and give you a receipt. When you go to the tour desk to ask what's taking so long. You show your receipt, they tell you Majestic doesn't book excursions. Juan took our deposit for 6 people (one of them the groom). The hotel did not reimburse us, nor did they put us on another tour. In fact, I felt, put them blame on us. After hours of arguing, we asked that they call the police, they refused. When I asked them how to dial the police myself, they would not tell me either. I found out later it is 911 (just an fyi). Aside from that, if you bring your lap top, be advised that hotel staff can and will hack into it and view the information you are viewing too (as they did my nephew's banking info). Then there is the casino. You really need to know the game you are playing, how much you are betting and how much you would win. Casino dealers will pay you incorrectly, take your money when you win and then say, No comprende. We did get them to rewind the tape and pay us correctly, once. The Majestic really made an impression on us. Their refusal to help us (their guests, who brought 30 other people) leads us to believe these incidents are not isolated. They know it goes on and they do not care. If you go be very cautious. PS. You can jimmy the in room safes open very easily. Do not be lured into a false sense of security.

<Content>Top Notch Service My wife and I along with 2 other couples stayed at the Majestic from Nov. 13th to Nov. 20th and I have to say it was one of the most georgeous all-inclusive resorts we have stayed at in years. The service was impecable, everyone was always willing to get you whatever you needed, no request was too big. During our stay there were a number of people who I guess just didn't get that they were on vacation. I overheard more then one person complain (and not in a respectful way either) that the food was not good, or the margarita was not too their liking or they lost a camera that THEY left unattended. It blows my mind that there are people out there that act like this, especially on vacation?!?!?!!? The staff handled their poor behavior with kind words and always went out of their way to help. Kill them with kindness seemed to be their motto.Also, I cannot remember many of the names of all the folks we met there but Tyson (I know it is spelled incorrectly) was one of the best, along with the crews at the pool bar and the lobby/outside bars (I guess I had more Majestic's than I thought). Thank you for providing top notch customer service, unfortunately that is something of a rareity these days. Also, I have to mention that we arrived on Tuesday 11/13 and my wife's luggage did not arrive until 11/18?!?!?!!? Instead of getting upset, we took it with a grain of salt (luckily one of our friends we were travelling with packed some extra clothes/bathing suits so it was not a big deal) but Laura at the front desk was always checking up on us making sure we were doing ok (thanks Laura!)All in all, this was one of the best trips we have been on at one of the nicest resorts. I do want to give a shout out to the crew from IL (hope you guys made it home ok, we had a blast) and Brad  Margo from TN (send us the pictures so I can put them on this site!! :-)We will most certainly return to the Majestic

<Content>Tropical Dominican Paradise!! TROPICAL DOMINICAN PARADISE-MAJESTIC COLONIALThis is my third all inclusive experience. My husband and I travelled to the Majestic Colonial for our honeymoon! We were there from 17NOV to 24NOV.This resort is pure paradise! If you are becoming leary due to the last couple of reviews, don't worry...some people just like to complain.CHECK INEasy, efficient, fast. Enjoy your welcome drink and grab another one on the way to your room. Felt relaxed right away!ROOMWonderful! Very large, clean, we had the Majestic Junior Suite with the direct pool access and 2 jacuzzi's. One outside on our patio and one inside the room. Our room was 2104 which was close to the lobby and away from the noise at the swim up bar. I would recommend this for a honeymoon. Bed is typical of the Caribbean...a little hard. We did not have wash cloths for our stay, no big deal for us. Ordered room service once and it was there very fast. Over all, absolutely delightful room!!POOLSo aweaome, it goes on for ever. It was fun to swim all the way down, and the direct pool access was a major plus. Very clean and picturesque. Best pool I can imagine!BEACHThis is a major thing for my husband and I. The beach is so spectacular! It is a very wide beach with lots of palapas and palms. The beach really doesn't feel crowded. The beach was my favourite thing about the resort!!BARSGreat! There are bars everywhere. We were a little dissapointed that there was no drink list, but they really can make almost anything. Majestic with rum! Main lobby bar on ground floor had slow service and we found that they were looking for tips here. Plaza bar was wonderful to sit and listen to the sax and piano player. We also found live music at the beach one night.ENTERTAINMENTWe aren't into daily activities, but it always seemed like there was something going on near the swim up bar in the afternoons. We watched the Michael Jackson Show, Circus Dream, and the 70/80's rewind show. Jackson and Circus were excellent. 70/80's not so good. We chose to skip the Miss Majestic, Men vs, Women, etc. Casino looked fun...not our thing either. Disco was amazing I'm sure...but we were on our honeymoon, more interested in relaxation. Didn't use the spa, but it looked pretty posh.RESTAURANTSI don't see what the problem is here. Anyone who didn't like the food, must not like food. The food was great, we gained like 5 lbs. each! Buffet was excellent for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The beach restaurant was efficient for lunch. The made to order pasta at each of these restaurants was awesome. Your water glass was never below half full, as well as wine or whatever you were drinking. We ate at Taino (Caribbean and Dominican), Le Gourmet, The Japanese Grill show, and the Steakhouse. All of the food was wonderful. It is important to mention that we did not recieve our soup course at Le Gourmet, and they also forgot my husband's appetizer at the Steakhouse. Nothing will ever be perfect. Food, overall, superb!!STAFFOverall quite good service, at times you could feel like you were being ignored at the bars. Our patio door did not lock on arrival, took two times of asking to get it fixed. Most of the staff were very happy and helpful. It's like anywhere though, you can't expect everyone to be in the best of moods all the time. Language barrier not really a problem.TOUR AND SHOPPINGWe took the Outback Safari, I recommend this tour so much!! You got to see more than I ever expected. You will not see the Dominican unless you go on a tour like the Safari. Plantations, crocodiles, beaches, mountains.....also a great way to buy cigars at the Rum Shack (prices in shop at resort are very high, on the tour they are very reasonable.)Shopping market right ouside the resort and to your right. It's called Punta Blanca. Also down the beach to your right about a half an hour is one of the markets on the beach. Bargain, bargain, bargain! Use US currency.WHEWWWWEnjoy your trip! You will love it, don't sweat any small stuff. Just look around and catch the Vacation Spirit. Majestic Colonial is 5* and I would return again. I like new experiences and new places, but I think it will be impossible to match the Majestic when I return to Punta Cana. Hope you have as awesome weather as we did!!RELAX AND ENJOY

<Content>Not so majestic after all........ My husband and I (early 30s) stayed at the Majestic from 8/11 to 22/11 and have vowed never to return to the Dominican Republic!This is undoubtedly a lovely hotel, however, I would think twice about booking a holiday to the Dominican if you are reading this.We booked in April when this resort was receiving almost flawless reviews and as big believers in trip advisor, thought we couldn't go wrong and were so looking forward all year to a magic holiday. It was far from that!The first major problem was the weather - a LOT of rain and big black clouds and this kind of complex is completely dependant on sunny days. Weather is obviously never guarnteed to be good though, is it? Perhaps it was an affect of the tropical storm Noel, I don't know.We had food poisoning TWICE forcing us to cancel two excursions. Violent vomiting and diarrhea all through the night and following day. The temperature of the food served at the buffet restaurants is worrying. You spend the days when you're well, scared to eat anything other than soup or pasta for fear of getting sick again! Food is a major let down at this complex.Mosquitos - we travel abroad each year and have never been bitten until we went to the Dominican! Repellant doesn't seem to stop them either!On a positive note, the rooms are lovely, amazing pool, lovely bars (they did lack atmosphere mind you), great nightly shows and the casino is good although we were robbed (aren't you always!). I wasn't overly impressed with the beach - have seen a lot better.We originally wanted to go to Mexico but settled on the Dominican as it was more affordable - I wish we had paid the extra money! We always had reservations about this island in that so many people we know came back with food poisoning, but still booked thinking we would be ok. Maybe we were just unlucky, but unless you want to spend your days nursing the toilet bowl in your room, go somewhere else and don't be disappointed in your much awaited holiday!

<Content>Wonderful People, Great resort Better late than never. Great visit. The resort itself is great. Nice large pool with more than enough room for swimming. The jacuzzis in the pool are the best. I loved this pool. Yes, there is a swim up bar too. The room was spacious. I didn't care much for the bathroom layout as I was staying with a friend. That's only cause I was with a friend. Otherwise it was fantastic. I never had too much of a problem finding something desirable to eat. Took a little adjustmen, but I managed. Each day there was some sort of snack left in our room. One day it was fruits and wine. Another it was sushi. Another chocolate covered strawberries. It was a nice touch. Went to the disco one nite and that was a blast. Met many great people in there.. Fantastic time. Only once I visited the casin, great thing was that I only walked thru, no gambling for me. The beach is great. IT's so large with many loungers. Loved it. The resort grounds are rather large. Be prepared to do some walking if you forget something in your room. Victor and Keyla at the front desk were of such great help when I needed it. They made the calls for me at the front desk to the hospital.  I went up to the desk about every two hours to check on the status of my friend. Arrangements were made for my friend to be able to stay another night at the Majestic. It ended up being two more nights accomodations made. they weren't going to ship her out anyplace else just getting out of the hospital. They are so kind. I have nothing but praise and thank yous for the employees at the Majestic. Everyone is truly fantastic at the entire resort. We arrived on the 12th and were to stay til the 16th. We went on a dive and that's where the mishap took place. My friend breathed in water and ended up in the hospital.  Going to the hospital there is a complete nightmare (could be any country outside of your own). Take care to not land yourself there. It takes forever hours to get the proper contacts made if you don't have somewhere about a couple grand to get yourself admitted. I would definately return to this resort Thank you Majestic friends for being so very helpful. .

<Content>Beautiful property  We stayed at the Majestic Colonial during Nov 18-23. Overall we had a great time.Pros:- The service was generally very good. A special thanks to Denny, who took good care of us at the beach and to Martin, at Matsuri, for two fantastic meals. Muchas gracias amigos!- The beach was fantastic ... sand castles, awesome body surfing, weather (warm w/ a breeze), plenty of chairs and palapas ... we lived at the beach- The pool was beautiful  fun ... the layout w/ bridges and islands was perfect for kid pool games (e.g., Marco Polo), floating around on my back looking up at the palm trees was very relaxing- Matsuri, the Japanese restaurant was a highlight for us- The property itself is beautiful and well maintained- Housekeeping was very efficientArea for improvement ... the food was just okay. My wife's wisdom - If they fixed the food, this would be a spectacular place.Suggestions:- have more a la carte options, rather than relying so heavily on a buffet format (buffet equates to overcooked, bland, cold, impersonal, etc.)- strive to achieve the personal touch of Matsuri in the other a la carte restaurants- how about parmesan for the pasta, rather than mozarella?- why not truly highlight Dominican food (which can be very tasty) in its own restaurant?- it would be nice to have the trusty American kid staples available ALL the time at most of the restaurants (e.g., hot dogs, chicken nuggets ... my boy was so happy to see Wendy's at the airport, pizza, macaroni  cheese)Overall, I would recommend this hotel for the beach, pool  beautiful grounds and friendly service.

<Content>Mixed feelings We stayed at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana from Nov. 10 to Nov. 17. Overall, it was a great experience, though there is certainly room for improvement. Pros: - the grounds are gorgeous and very well maintained for the most part. We did notice some signs of wear-and-tear that we did not expect in a 5-star, 2-year-old hotel.- the beach is amazing, and there are lots of lounge chairs and palapas. We never had a problem finding a great spot on the beach.- the pool is probably the best I have ever seen - it is huge and beautifully done. - the a la carte restaurants (Le Gourmet, Matsuri, Rodeo Grill, and Tres Calaveras) were all great. We enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. Cons: - the service was not the best. Our return flight was not leaving until 10 pm, so we tried to arrange for a late check-out, paying the $40 fee. You would not believe the hassle - every time we went to talk to them they asked us to come back later or the next day, wait for a supervisor that never seemed to be around, etc. We did eventually get our late check-out - on the very last day, hours before we were supposed to leave the hotel. We were not impressed. Room service was also hit-and-miss, occasionaly forgetting wash cloths, soap, coffee, or sugar. We came back to our room once to find the bed only half made. - the food at the buffets left a lot to be desired, in terms of variety and even quality. Unless you came first thing, as soon as the restaurant opened, the food would be cold and lacking. - the service in some of the restaurants was poor. Some of the waiters made you feel like they were doing you a favour serving you, and others just plain forgot what you had ordered and left you waiting for ever, and then acted surprised or annoyed when you tried to remind them. Granted, some of the waiters were wonderfully attentive, but service in a 5-star hotel should not be hit-and-miss. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for the sheer beauty of the grounds and scenery, but be prepared for occasional annoyances.

<Content>Don't Believe the Hype! Upon arrival everything seemed normal until we were informed our room wouldn't be ready for 2 hours! Things were missing from our room when we finally got in to it. We were served a complimentary fruit plate in our room without any utensils to eat it with. The hotel and beach were beautiful, but couldn't make up for the poor service and ordinary and mediocre food. Getting a water glass filled seemd like a major chore. We had to call daily to ensure our room even got cleaned. The beach cleaners were lazy and often forgot to pick up bags of debris that eventually ended up back in the water.Something must have changed from the time we read all of the reviews 6 months ago and November 10, 2007. This hotel is over rated big time. If your only desire is a beautiful hotel - this is the place. If you have expectations for your money - you'll be disappointed.Notice:BEWARE! The ugly American tourist has been replaced by the over bearing, loud, don't-care-about-your-personal-space Eastern European. We met very pleasant folks from Spain, Canada, Italy, and the USA. The folks from the old Eastern Bloc, and the like were obnoxious and rude.Kevin

<Content>Don't go unless you want food poisoning! My boyfriend and I (who are in our mid-30's) just returned from a week's stay at the Majestic Colonial鈥擭ovember 10-17. After reading positive reviews on this site before our trip, as well as traveling extensively in the past, this vacation proved to be an utter disappointment, please read on. This review is very detailed, but I feel it is a must read for anyone contemplating choosing this wretched hotel.THE FOODFirst and foremost, on day 3 (Tues.), my boyfriend became ill with food poisoning. At this point, we weren't sure from what. We had eaten at the Mexican restaurant the previous night, but for now, I felt OK. We spent the entire day in the room as he rested his stomach. Luckily, it was pouring this day (more on that later).Wednesday early am (3:15am), I awoke with nausea and stomach cramps. Tuesday evening, we had eaten at Le Gourmet, the international restaurant, which requires reservations, where I had the grouper. Since my boyfriend had muscles on Monday, at this point, we were convinced it was the seafood that was tainted. I spent the next 24 hours held up in the room with VIOLENT vomiting and diarrhea. We received medicine from the pharmacy (at a cost of $50) that finally curbed only the vomiting at around 4pm on Wednesday; however, the diarrhea continued for BOTH of us. I was finally able to leave the room Thursday morning after having to reschedule our excursion, originally planned for Wednesday. Despite telling the staff that we both had food poisoning from their ill-prepared food, they were more concerned that we were missing our Sales appointment and called several times, persisting that my boyfriend still come down.We were terrified to eat anything after being so sick, so we ate mostly rolls. Finally, on Friday night鈥攖he last night of our vacation鈥攚e were feeling a little better, so we got meals. Avoiding the seafood this time, I had chicken, and he had beef. Not 10 minutes after this dinner, I ran back to the room with more nausea and vomiting, forced to end my trip at 8pm. We had to take pills by the fistful just to make the flight.WE WERE NOT ALONE! We spoke to at least 5 other couples that we had become friendly with over the course of our stay, and every one had some symptoms of food poisoning. One couple on an off-site excursion said that they lost two days of their honeymoon to the food poisoning at the Majestic. Just imagine how many couples we didn't speak to had this issue.THE ALCOHOLBe warned that, unlike other all-inclusives you may have experienced, the Majestic does not allow you to have bottles delivered to your room, unless you want to pay. There is a two beer per day limit in your room. After that, you have to pay or walk down to the bar. So if you feel like retiring to your balcony and sipping on a bottle of champagne like we did, it will cost you anywhere from $35 to $80 a bottle to do so.... or as so gracefully suggested by a staff member, go drink it at the bar where it's free. If you want beer in a bottle at the bar, $3, but we were OK with beer in cups.Also, we were told by the representative who booked our excursion not to drink the Pina Coladas, as (and I quote), Dominican pineapples contain a 'substance' that make people sick. Why, then, do they serve it? PS - we did not have any Pina Coladas while there, so that was not the cause of our illness.THE RESERVATIONSWe attempted to make reservations at both Matsuri (Japanese) and Le Gourmet (International) restaurants. We were told the Japanese restaurant was booked solid all week. Every night we looked in, only to see more than half of the tables empty. After eating at the French restaurant and seeing the same thing, we learned that both restaurants were grossly understaffed. They weren't filled to capacity; but rather, they could only accommodate a very limited number of people per night. Le Gourmet also pushes very hard for you to purchase wine by the bottle. They scoffed a bit when we asked for ours by the glass, a.k.a. free.THE ROOMOverall, the rooms were very nice and as pictured on the website. The hot tub was smaller than most we have encountered and the jets were very weak, but it still did the trick. The rooms were sometimes not cleaned until 6pm or later, and no wash cloths are provided. All of our faucets were reversed, hot labeled cold, and vice versa.THE OCEANI am not sure if this was due to weather, but the ocean water was nowhere near the color of the crystal blue water pictured on the website. As a graphic designer, I feel that the ocean color may have been Photoshop enhanced in the photos for appeal. It was still very pretty, but definitely more on the green side. Contact me if you'd like to see photos of what I mean.THE SPAWe booked massages for Thursday morning, both of which were very relaxing and professionally done. $80 for Relaxing and $85 for deep tissue. A few points of criticism on the spa facility itself:1. There is a men's and women's steam room鈥攖he men's was out of order, but they told us that my boyfriend could use the women's.2. We were only given 1 locker key for the two of us, causing me to have to carry all of my clothes out of the locker room and give them to him to lock up. It also meant that we got 1 pair of slippers for the two of us, since they were in the lockers, and I had to walk around in my bare feet. They would not budge on this.3. They have two Jacuzzis outside of the spa. One of which was ice cold and turned off. There is also a separate horseshoe-shaped bath area that was also drained/ non-functioning. 4. No soap in the shower areaFITNESS CENTERAs fitness enthusiasts, we work out every day on vacations and have seen some wonderful gyms. The gym was terrible, with two treadmills that would stop at random while you were running due to faulty sensors. The gym is also very warm, cutting workouts a bit short. There is only one set of each free weight, so if someone else is using them, you are out of luck. The man working the gym enthusiastically handed us our towels the first day, but I suppose since we didn't tip him, he ignored us for the rest of the week. He didn't offer spots or any help with the malfunctioning equipment. He just sat there, miserable, or working out himself. Despite this, we still got a workout of some sort in every day. A bad gym is better than no gym. CLIENTELEEveryone at the resort was very friendly. Nearly everyone at our resort was either Canadian or European, with very few Americans. The Europeans were quite comfortable going topless both at the beach and the pool. What was most surprising to us were the few topless鈥攐r completely naked鈥攜oung European girls on the beach. These were not toddlers, perhaps between 8 and 13 years old. Again, I assume this is completely acceptable in their culture, but just be prepared for this culture shock if American or Canadian.STAFFThe staff was very friendly and eager to please. Nelson was particularly nice and looked for us every day. In general, they didn't offer any extra service for large tips. My boyfriend tipped the bartender at the outside bar $20 on one evening, and he didn't even remember him the next day. I would say $2-$5 for good service is sufficient, although not necessary.ENTERTAINMENTThe Michael Jackson show in the arena was very entertaining. I was very disappointed that the poolside/bar side entertainment was very sporadic. This may have been due to the weather, but I believe there was only entertainment in this area 3 of our 7 nights. If you wanted a drink outside at night, you basically sat in silence. WEATHERTo be honest, I am not sure if this is typical Dominican weather, but it POURED all day, every day but two at our resort. Our excursion, the Caribbean Festival snorkeling trip, went out on the water in the pouring rain. We all had a great time anyway, but the bad weather certainly didn't cancel the trip. We had expected a tropical storm that would quickly pass, but to our dismay, the weather was terrible most of the week with no reprieve. Maybe well choose a more desert island next year, like Aruba. :)As you can see, our experience at this hotel was nothing short of horrifying, with absolutely no apologies made by the staff for the food poisoning or the like. After barely making it home, my boyfriend proceeded to the ER in his hometown, where they took cultures to see if it's perhaps a parasite. We'll find out in a day or so. Please feel free to contact me on this resort. This experience was so disappointing; I would hate to see anyone else's long-awaited vacation be ruined as ours was.

<Content>Beautiful Resort but not paradise for us The Majestic Colonial Resort is a beautiful resort which has a lot to offer vacationers. The grounds are breathtaking and constantly being cared for and the enormous pool is truly majestic and never feels crowded. The beach was lovely and you never had to worry about finding a lounger or shade area if that is where you wanted to relax. The ocean temperature was actually warmer than the pool water and the beach was well taken care of and cleaned daily by staff. The staff there were friendly and always courteous and always attempted to provide for your needs to the best of their ability. Our favorite restaurant was the gourmet restaurant and their service and four entrees offered were excellent. The only consistent complaint I would have about the restaurants is that coffee is not readily available. The servers would usually pour a half cup and many times it was prepoured and frequently not hot when it was served. (I wondered if the availability of coffee beans were affected by previous storms as I never noticed this at my stay in Puerto Plata several years ago.) Unfortunately the weather during our stay was not ideal with lots of cloudy days and frequent heavy rains that makes your entire vacation experience less than ideal. The hotel has no control over the weather but the little annoyances that you may not have noticed become more pronounced when you are spending more time wandering around the resort in the rain. Be prepared to wear rubber soled sneakers as the beautiful tiled hallways and walkways are extremely slippery when wet especially during downpours.I don't want to sound like a complainer but would like to comment on some issues I encountered so that other guests may be able to avoid them in the future and enjoy their stay more. Room It was a standard jr. suite in building 4 which was a ground floor room with our balcony facing the construction area that was blocked by a black netting. The construction work did start early and several night went late probably trying to make up for lost hours due to heavy rainfalls. (Noise was an issue if you chose to use the patio but not heard inside room) The room is very large and we had no issues with the layout of this suite. The bed was fine but the pillows could be improved. The sofa is not comfortable(if you were sitting in the sun this would not be an issue) and the fabric covering it and the bench appeared dirty due to old stains. The increased moisture and ground floor location also contributed to increased number of centipede/inchworm type creatures found inside our room throughout our stay. (The rooms were cleaned excellent by staff so cleanliness was not the contributing factor here.) We were unfortunately assigned a room that had a door that would accomodate guests that wanted adjoining rooms. The door is extremely hollow and we could hear conversations of the guests in that room as if they were sitting right next to you. Circumstances had one family with children/baby crying which was tolerable but the last night we were awakened to new drunken guests screaming and cursing at each other several times during the night. When we checked in we were told that the hotel was fully booked so we did not request a room change. I would recommend requesting room on upper floors and not accept adjoing door suite to eliminate the problems I experienced. EntertainmentThe animation team works hard but I only did two dancing lessons as daytime activities. I did use the gym but was disappointed that the treadmill kept shutting off on me after manually trying to increase speed to increase my pace. I chose to walk around the perimeter of resort for exercise but that was interrupted by heavy downpours. The shows at night were not impressive and it seemed like the only other choice of entertainment was the sax and keyboard player who were good but it did become a little repetitive after two nights. No activities available during rain that we were aware of. Medical EmergenciesDO NOT TRAVEL TO PUNTA CANA UNLESS YOU ARE INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY OR HAVE TRAVEL INSURANCE THAT COVERS UNANTICIPATED ILLNESSES. My husband became violently ill with a bacterial gastrointestinal illness. I don't think it matters how or where he picked up this bacteria but I can assure you he has traveled all over the world including many third world countries and knows standard precautions to take to avoid these type illnesses. The hotel MD was a pleasure to deal with and was very competent. My husband was sent to private hospital for IV antibiotics and fluids by ambulance. The cost of these services were $400 and charged to my credit card. I just by chance remembered that I had purchased travel insurance for the first time due to threat of hurricanes and was pleasantly surprised that it covered medical emergencies too. The hotel doctor did tell me to have the hospital contact the insurance company which I did when I arrived. The billing person kept telling me they did not take any US travel insurances but I insisted they call prior to giving them my credit card for guaranteed payment prior to treatment. She then informed me the insurance would pay but again wanted my credit card which I was reluctant to present. The hospital was very clean and of course we did have some communication difficulties as we do not speak Spanish fluently but nothing insurmountable. The biggest problem was trying to be discharged as they wanted guaranteed payment but were not accepting verbal and written confirmation of payment by insurance company and appeared to be insisting on charging my credit card as opposed to insurance payment guarantee. I actually spoke to insurance case manager several times via telephone and she said they had never encountered this before and she had dealt with same facility on prior occasions. As we finally left the hospital I observed another frustrated family dealing with same issue of insurance guantee that we had. I recognize that this facility does not want vacationers to disappear without receiving payment but when they are dealing with internationally known insurance companies there has to be a better way to a confirm coverage without causing patients and their families the increased stress. I would have been willig to use my credit card if that was procedure to get reimbursement from insurance company but they stated they already guaranteed payment and I didn't want to be double billed for services. I also was not able to receive a written itemized list of supplies and cost of services when we left hospital.I think a variety of circumstances such as the rainy weather, less than ideal room location, one bad meal resulting in bacterial infection and hospital experience will not bring me back to Punta Cana in the near future. If I did choose to return and wanted a quiet relaxing vacation and could be guaranteed an upper level floor without adjoining doors I would try the Majestic again as it really is a magnificent property. Suggestions to the management team at the Majestic would be to make sure you have information and maps of property in English and other languagues for new arrival guests. Also it would be a great if they actually had drink menus at the bars so guests could experiment with new drinks and know what types of beverages were available and ingredients in them.

<Content>Not as Good as Last Year This was our second time visiting the Majestic and was very disappointed in the service compared to last year. We had purchased the Majestic Colonial Swim-up rooms, which I would highly recommend, and upon check in told they had non available and would have to be placed in a different category of room. After an hour of negotiations and being told that even though we payed more money to be in the swim up room it is not guarantied and we were not going to be compensated for the oversight. We were eventually given a Majestic Colonial room but you have to be persistent. These rooms are well worth their price as you have your own lounge chairs and direct access to the pool. You also get free room service with this room classification, which the breakfast and lunch menus come highly recommended. Last year the rooms were very clean and the well kept, this year not so much. There were a couple of days that they did not clean our room until 6:00 pm at knight while and we never did receive face cloths (bring your own). We also had mice in our room and when we complained to the front desk they informed us that they had no other rooms to move us to.Last year the entertainment group was outstanding by maintaining a good connection with the guests and keeping their performances family orientated, while maintaining a level of enjoyment for all. Unfortunately, I found this year鈥檚 entertainment group unable to maintain this same level of performance standard. One of the reasons we returned this year was the saxophone player in the out side bar, which he is no longer there. I always find the food at this hotel good with a nice verity of choices. This year they had added a fast food restaurant just outside the disco, which is open all night. We ate there a couple of times and it was okay, but very busy and only one guy working. For some reason it was a challenge for some of the people in my group to get drinks at the bars, which surprised me but did happen more that I would like to mention. There is also an average of 4 weddings a day so it is very busy at some of the restaurants in the evening.Having said all this, I love this hotel and you will not find another pool like the one at the Majestic. This hotel is beautiful with it鈥檚 lush grounds and white sand beach. For the most part you will find it very clean and well kept, but there is construction going on all around it and there does seem to be a lack of staff.

<Content>Great Vacation Location My wife and I had a wonderful week's stay at the Majestic fron November 7-14th, 2007. Here are comments for reviewers to decide if this is a destination to visit.  Cheap Caribbean.com-first time we booked a trip with them, and it won't be the last. They had the best price for us, and were extremely courteous, professional and informative the two times we called prior to our trip. Check out their webpage and give them a try. Punta Cana Airport-has improved it's services since our first visit two years ago. Turinder Ground Transportation-booked through Cheap Caribbean. Very efficient at the airport. The mini-van was clean, air-conditioning worked. The driver spoke very little English, but three other passengers spoke Spanish and translated as the driver pointed out places of intetest. His comment about the Majestic was, Paradise.The trip from the airport to the Majestic was approximately 50 minutes. We had two stops prior to the Majestic , and were behind a slow dump truck for a large part of the trip. You'll understand why if you visit the island. The roads are narrow and not well-maintained once you travel about a mile from the airport. Close your eyes if your squeamish about passing on narrow roads and curves. Recommend you don't rent a car. Either book ground transportation in advance, or local taxis, which are in droves at the airport. We recommend the former, but it's a personal preferance. Bear in mind, this island is fairly impoverished so the ride from the airport should not be construed a harbinger of what the resort is like. Majestic Resort  Spa-very lavish, the upper and lower lobbies in the main building where you register in and check-out is very elegant. The gounds are lush and constantly maintained.As soon as we arrived, we were given a cold towel and a Majestic, the resort's signature drink. Check-in was quick and efficient. Roberto, who checked us, walked us to our room.We had booked a Junior Colonial Suite with a hot tub. This is what were given, however it was in Building 4, which is next to the construction of the resort's expansion project. Our balcony overlooked the construction and offered a limited view of the beach and ocean. The hot tub was on a separate patio, which abutted the building in front of us. This patio, however, was 45 feet long and 8 feet wide with a large hot tub. We advised Roberto we preferred a room in another building, and he accomodated us the next day. We paid a little more and were given an ocean-front room in Building Two. We had the same patio set-up, as the previous room, and fronted the beach. The room was spacious, our maid service was great. We did not experience any problems with the room at all. This being said, we both could see where privacy would be a problem for travelers with more than two people staying in the room. The bathroom area is open to the rest of the room, so if you want privacy, you either gut it out and tell the other guests to turn their backs or go out on the balcony or patio, or you use the large tiled shower to change. The toilet is a very narrow stall next to the shower. Both shower and bathroom have frosted glass doors. Our room had a double sink vanity. Hot water was never an issued. Yes, we used our hot tub everyday, except the last due to rain. Oh, yea, the pillows are not very comfortable, but after a long day at the beach, copious amounts of your favorite beverage, three full meals and the late show, you won't notice the pillow firmness at all. Food: We did not have issues with any of the food, although we both felt the food at Dreams Cancun and Dreams Puerto Vallarta was of better quality and presentation. The buffet offered a wide variety of food at breakfast. Reservations are needed at The Le Gourmet and Japanese Restaurants, so book them as soon as you check in. The Mexican restaurant was our least favorite. The Steakhouse and Seafood Grill both were very good.Service: I know other reviewers have downgraded service at this resort, but we both felt it was impeccable at the front desk and restaurants. The staff hovered around us at every restaurant, and could not have been more friendly, courteous and professional. This was really the atmosphere they conveyed throughout the resort.The bar staffs are overworked especially at the Beach Bar. The only really negative comment is the lack of service on the beach. They only have two attendants taking and delivering orders but they takes way too long to deliver the drinks to you. The beach is spacious and clean with ample palapas and chairs. The water is fairly warm and you can swim. The pool meanders thoughout the center of the resort, and is so large it never appears crowded. Water is chilly but feels good after sitting out in the sun. Your allowed two towels a day-trade in the used and get two clean.There is a large bulletin board outside the rear of the main building outlining daily events and the nightly show. The Michael Jackson Show was was loud, high energy and very entertaining. The entertainment staff puts their hearts and souls into these shows, and while it's not Broadway, the shows are enjoyable. The theater is quite large and comfortable. Shows start at 10am,and last 45 minutes to an hour.Casino: very small-maybe 20 slot machines and ten table games. We won on the slots as did other guests. Check out was a breeze and Turinder's van came early to take us to the airport.Tipping: It's a personal preferance. To us, we feel good service should be rewarded so we tip. Bear in mind the staff probably make a pittance, but still provide great customer service, which my wife and I, who had waitering jobs in college, appreciate. Weddings: Multiple wedding everday. There is a picturesque, large wedding gazebo in the center of the resort, and weddings are held on the beach. This would be a great location for a Destination Wedding.In short, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will return again.Warnings:Avoid flying in and out of Miami, especially returning. If you have to, allow yourself at least 2.5 to 4 hours in between flights. We had a 4 hour layover for our flight to Dulles Airport. By the time we cleared immigration, customs, and security we only had an hour until our departing flight left. If topless bathing will be an issue with you, then avoid not only this resort, but this island. The DR is a favorite vacation spot for Europeans and South Americans, where topless bathing is the norm. A favorite alcoholic beverage is a liquer called Mamajuana, purportedly an aphrodisiac. It can be purchased already brewed, or with the ingredients to make it yourself. We did the latter and were told by customs, at the Punta Cana Airport, to either pour rum into it, on the spot, or have it confiscated. We did have rum so right in front of the customs staff, we filled the bottles, and were sent on our merry way. Save yourselves the hassle, and by it already brewed.I enjoy writing reviews of the place we visit, and answering questions from anyone who hasen't been too bored after reading my comments

<Content>Absolutely Majestic 5 Star Vacation of a lifetime We arrived on a Monday Nov. 5 at the Majestic, on a vacation that we won from work, and was greeted with cool towels and drinks in the most gorgeous Lobby that I ever saw. Truely elegant and filled with the most pleasant people that I have ever come in contact with. We were taken to our room when we were ready to go and were taken to an ocean front room that would knock your socks off. The ocean front rooms, in which there are few, have only king sized beds. Being two women on our vacation my boss and myself, we prefered to have two beds and the management was kind enough to get another full size bed put into our room for me. We were delighted. There was still plenty of enough room left over in there to make it very comfortable. We would like to thank Victor for all hs help with our room accomodations they were astonishing.The all inclusive meals were fantastic. There were choices of 7 different restaurants  9 bars to choose from at your conveience. Full breakfasts, continental as well, lunches and dinners that could stuff you to the gills from seafood, to Japanese, to the Rodeo Steak House which was our favorite. We would like to thank our waiter Joel who served us every time we dined there because we requested him or if he saw us would gladfully adress us as his VIP's. We loved the way he made us feel like Royalty. Keep up the great job, Joel, you are a very valued employee.We had a European Massage at the Metamorphesis Spa that was so wonderful. I commend Joelle, she has fantastic hands and does a fabulous job as well.The beach and pools are outstanding as well. You can exchange your towel for a fresh one any time you would like to and as many times a day as you want. Denny the Beach Consierge was very quick to get you a refreshment even water if you wanted. Thanks Denny. And the Beach Security was outsatnding also. They made us feel safe and secure. They worked hard to patrol the beach throughout the entire day  night (24/7) and also help to keep the daily beach marriages as private as they could. I would like to thank and commend Jordane for doing a great job- you are very a special person! Knowing you are safe is very important. Thanks again Jordane.We did not do any excursions because we wanted our vacation to be a relaxing one and it was. We did see the daily evening shows they were all fantastic. the entertainers were fabulous.On Sunday we went to a Catholic mass at the church right at the Majestic. This was one of the most beautiful churches I have ever seen. Because there were more english speaking guests present the priest had Karina translate for us and had the readings read in English. It was beautiful and nice to receive communion while on vacation.Saul made sure we had the proper times for our return home, which was very hard to do because you don't want to leave once you become mesmerized by by Punta Cana's mystery.We stayed till Now 13 but could have stayed for three more weeks and would have enjoyed every minute without boredom.This was an all time favorite vacation of mine and will go in the books so far as the best ever.This was truely a 5 star Al Inclusive package that I would love to do at least once a year at the best hotel in Punta Cana. A vacation of a life time that is affordable for more than once in a lifetime. Again thanks to Denny, Joel, Joelle,Victor,Saul and especially Jordane for making my vacation the most memorable of all. I miss you. God Bless you and keep you all safe -till we meet again.Sandra, New Jersey

<Content>Overbooked, sorry... next please! We booked (way in advance, somewhere september 2007) a week at this hotel-resort by our travel agent, with Neckermann Holland as the tour operator. As we were planned to leave the other day (!), i couldnt believe the lady from the travel agency telling me that the hotel was overbooked! We immediately contacted and visited our travel agent and neckermann, they confirmed that this hotel just announced they had overbooked us. We were to leave the other day! Everything was packed, brochures, pasports, vaccination, and of course the whole feeling of leaving on vacation... all just vanished! They proposed us to stay at some other resort for at least 1 day and then to move on, or to stay at the other resort the entire stay... We just decided not to leave for the Dominican republic... so no holiday. Beware of this hotel !! They tend to overbook and let you know just hours before you arrive!!D. VerbiestThe Netherlands

<Content>all-around excellent value We just returned from a 5 day stay at the Majestic and would love to go back someday. There were 5 of us (4 adults and a 7 year old) and there was truly something for every age and interest. After a long, 2 plane flight with layovers, we were greeted in the huge lobby with a cool towel and drink. As with many places in the Caribbean, the lobby is open air, so any bit of cooling was appreciated. Even in November the temperature hovered in the high 80's with humidity. Our rooms were next door to each other and exactly 1 minute from the beach. As requested, Emely gave us exactly what we had asked for. The rooms are spacious and kept very clean by the friendly housekeeping staff. A bottle of champagne and plate of fruit was waiting for us. Another day we found a bottle of wine and chocolates, along with flowers on the bed and strewn over the huge, open Jacuzzi tub. The bathroom set-up is more open than many Americans might be used to, but it didn't bother us. The door to the loo is frosted, but does not quite go to the ceiling, so it is not as private as most bathrooms. However, the shower is huge and we were really only in the room to sleep and change.The beach is spectacular with tons of lounges and palapas. The water is warmer than we are used to (thank goodness) but still refreshing with some minor waves. The sand is crystal clear white. Strangely, there are absolutely no shells, so walking is carefree.There are about 7 restaurants to choose from and only 2 require reservations. We loved the gigantic buffet breakfast where there was truly something for the pickiest eater. We remarked that the Europeans all selected healthy yogurt and a bran cereal while the Americans were loading up on bacon, sausage and made to order omelets, or waffles or pancakes. You get the idea!The guests reflect the world, with about 60% from North America (lots of Canadians having a great time!!) and the rest from Europe. There was a little topless on the beach, but our 7 year old got over it faster than the 2 adult men in our group.You had a choice of where to eat for every meal and I thought the food was above average for feeding so many. We particularly liked the Steak House chateaubriand and others told us the Gourmet Restaurant was lovely. We could not visit there because they do not allow children, which makes for a romantic adult evening. Drinks of all kinds really flow and they stock your in-room refrigerator with water bottles, soda and beer every day. My recommendation would be to drink some kind of liquid everyday as you do get dehydrated from the heat.The pool is the biggest I have ever seen....and beautiful as it meanders along one whole side of the resort, crossed by wooden bridges at various spots. Bring a floatie if you are a pool person!Finally, one of the nicest things here was the lovely Dominican people. Every person we encountered, from a gardener, to the maids, to bartenders, waiters and front office staff were charming and working so hard to ensure guests had a lovely time. Please...this is a poor country, so tip them often with a smile. They are working hard to improve their lives and the lives of their families and they responded so kindly to my poor Spanish and a smile.This resort gives you amazing value for the money and we would quickly return again.

<Content>Magic at the Majestic My friends and I recently returned from an amazing vacation at the Majestic Colonial! The resort is beautiful and very well-kept. The rooms are spacious and clean. The pool and the beach are exactly what you want from a tropical getaway. The food is good and the cocktails are plentiful. But the most appealing part of the Majestic Colonial are the people. From the moment you step foot on the property, you are greeted with warm smiles that continue for the entirety of your stay. The staff is extremely friendly and make it a priority to ensure everyone is enjoying themselves. There is constant entertainment-- whether it be games by the pool, Vegas style shows or dancing day and night. The place exudes fun. The animation teams in particular do a fabulous job of making your trip a special one...especially the animation team of Ralph, Samuel, Tyson and Kelly! Their enthusiastic and fun-loving personalities were contagious and made it impossible to be anything but relaxed and happy - the perfect combination of ingredients for the ideal getaway.My friends and I are already planning our return trip back there. It is a place that you will want to visit time and time again!

<Content>Majestical... My family and I attended a wedding at the Majestic Colonial.The resort itself is huge...could easily get lost the first few days. Everything was wonderful from check in to check out...from the rooms to the restaurants. Although the resort was at full capacity...it never felt crowded as the pool runs the length of the resort...therefore, creating many spots for people to relax in the sun. Never had a problem finding shade...always got to the pool around 9am.I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone...worth every penny.PS. The wedding was magnificent...Larissa (wedding coordinator) did a good job for the couple.

<Content>Majestic.......all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!! We just returned from 8 days/7 nights in Majestic Heaven. What a wonderful resort....we read all the reviews before booking, both good and bad, and are so glad we believed the good and took the chance! Check-in was a breeze.....cool cloths, welcome cocktail, friendly staff. Since we arrived early, our room was not ready...so we had a fabulous lunch, wandered the beautiful grounds..went back and were given our room key. The room....large, very clean...no musty smell as I had read. Yes, the bathroom stall is a bit different....but not the problem as described in some reviews. Cleaned at various times but always to perfection. The view was of the pool...........WHAT A POOL!!!Winding thro the resort , clean and refreshing. Pool chairs....MORE than abundant....definitely not the chair game in other resorts. The beach was awesome.......many chairs and huts to choose from...at any time....the sand was like walking on talc...the water clean, sand area clean....just wonderful.The staff is very friendly  small tips, altho not required, are always appreciated...they all work very hard to please you at every turn. The food.........if you cannot find anything to eat in this resort, you must live on another planet..........it was wonderful......fresh, plentiful, amazing choices...the buffet went on forever! The steakhouse is definitely to be tried! The seafood also. We did not try the french as we forgot to make reservations....only the Japanese  French require this...out of 7 places to eat.DO take sunscreen...it is very expensive at the resort...we also took bug spray....but never used it. Also take some snacks, pretzels, peanuts etc. if you think you will need one during the day, these are also horribly pricey.All in all......this was a fabulous place to stay and we will definitely return. There is no take a chance here...it is simply heavenly.

<Content>The best holiday ever !! Arrival to Majestic Colonial:Check in was smooth and receptionist was very smily and polite. Room was awsome and spacious. We had bottle of champagne waiting for us in the room what was a very nice surprise. Bed was very confy and sheets soft. Maids made sure our room was kept nice and tidy although we are bit messy travellers.Gourmet restaurant was little bit disappointting but other restaurants were suberb! There was so many choices what to eat and for sure something for everyone. We did not miss breakfast, lunch or dinner and there was no time when you could not eat.Restaurant staff were very smily and professional.Hotel itself is very spacious and well maintained. Very posh I would say. Have to say my jaw dropped when we arrived!Pool area was kept very clean and pool itself was awsome. Beach was nice and clean too. As pool area and beach were so large it never felt full and stuffed. There was always space and sunbeds for everyone. Casino was quite small but It had all we needed. Some of the girls (casino dealers) looked bit depressed but we found some smily ones here and there.Nightclub barmen were awsome too. Very entertaining people and certainly gave their smiles to everyone and service was fast! Had a great time there.Overall majestic holiday!! So friendly atmosphere. Staff never passes you by not greeting you HOLA ! I will definately return and I can warmly recommend this hotel to everyone.Tara and Joachim, London

<Content>3 late 20s/early 30s couples take our annual trip - this time with +s and -s The group: 3 close couples ranging in ages from mid 20s to early 30s who travel together annually.The time: November 3rd-7th (we left earlier than the other 2 couples because of work).Reviews:-Check-in: was a cluster. We arrived and were happy to bump into one of the other couples we were meeting in Punta Cana. It came out that they weren't able to check in as they didn't have a printed voucher which ended up being a copy of their Emailed itinerary. They literally had to go over to Guest Services and log into Email to get the print out and bring it back - hello, technology? Since when can't you check into a hotel with the credit card you used to make the reservation? At most with a picture ID? There were a bunch of other people going through this check-in hell and the cold clothes and no liquor drinks weren't enough to make anyone happy. We were lucky to have this print out but when we checked in they had no rooms available and it was 3:00pm and we had been up since 3:00am. Our check-in attendant was less than helpful, would not listen, and we finally had to demand a room and were promptly placed next to the construction (which we never heard so no big deal).-Rooms: The rooms are beautiful, spacious, and well kept. We were welcomed with a bottle of champagne and a stocked mini fridge which was nice. Extra shower towels would have been fantastic but were delivered upon request. The in-room safe was great, especially considering I was nervous about leaving important things in the room. The shower was spacious and jacuzzi tub in the room was a nice touch. The bed was like lying on a tiled floor and the pillows were marginal but we made do.-Customer service: You found some, you didn't. We met 2-4 really great people at the Majestic. Pablo and Jose were excellent to us and remembered us - many of the bartenders were smiles and fun, always taking the time to talk to us and interact. The staff at the restaurants leave a LOT to be desired. I've never seen such poor attitudes and bad customer service. The front desk staff, as indicated above, were subpar, with the exception of Rafael who coordinated transportation for us via our Blackberry the day of our arrival. Maybe it's the culture, but it seemed more often than not that we as guests were bothering the staff. The spa ladies were superb, however!-Food: Below average. I was SHOCKED at how the food was, especially after reading so many positive reviews. Maybe I come from a location where the food is way beyond average and have traveled to other islands with phenomenal food but this was probably the largest disappointment. After a day or so, we were able to navigate and remember what was good and what was bad and so it seemingly got better. The food at Le Gourmet was good, with French influence but not French cuisine. The food at the Japanese place was good, but this was our most horrific experience of customer service so that was a bit shadowed. Suggestion: get reservations immediately upon check-in for these two restaurants as we weren't able to do the Japanese hibatchi portion of the Japanese restaurant. Taino was a decent Mexican/Dominican buffet and the breakfast was pretty good (aside from the rubbery french toast and pancakes). I suggest lunch at the main buffet as the one on the beach rarely changes and isn't all that good. Also, the buffets are even strict on attire, so it was somewhat frustrating to not be able to walk off the beach/pool and get lunch without changing into clothes. Also, there is no 24 hour access to food - this was disappointing as sometimes between meals you want a quick snack (especially when drinking) and it was not there.Beach/pool: Phenomenal. I have been all over and this beach was one of the best beaches I've been to and it's the best pool I've ever been to. The ocean is like being in a wave pool - a ton of fun for boogie boarding! There are ample amounts of chairs and huts which is excellent. I suggest taking advantage of the massage on the beach as it was so relaxing and beautiful! The pool is SO clean and has lots of neat spots with jacuzzis, ledges to sit on, a swim-up bar, etc... Again, plenty of chairs and huts.Overall: Pretty good. It's a shame that the check-in experience, poor customer service, and so-so food brought my experience expectations lower than before arrival because this resort is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are well kept, extremely tropical and pretty, clean and full of life. The Michael Jackson show was a blast and many of the bartenders were charismatic and a lot of fun to be around. The rooms were pretty, the beach and pool some of the best I've seen. I think the Majestic can easily improve upon some of the things I've listed and it will truly attract return visitors. Will I go back? Not unless someone gets married there (which they pump out multiple weddings a day - crazy!) or the group decides to return. I think there are better places in the Carribean and look forward to experiencing them - however the Colonial was a great time, excellent experience and I encourage others to visit with the understanding of some of the shortcomings I've identified.

<Content>Great Place with very nice people This hotel is a great place to spend your holidays. The beautiful beach and the huge pool offer more than enough space to relax in the carribean flair. 8 different restaurants give an excellent posibility for dining. The entertainment programm which takes place every night in the theatre and later on in the disco is remarkable.My special thanks to the animation team. We became good friends and had lots of fun together. Many greetings my thanks and the best wishes to :Geidy, Miguel, Sandy, Henry, Jesus, Pablo, Nelson, Lina, Kelly, Samuel, Kiko, Andres and Taison

<Content>Loved the Majestic! The three of us stayed at the Majestic from Oct 27th to Nov3rd and it was a great experience.I stayed at the Majestic last year when it first opened and have to say that it was good then but MUCH better now. We got there a few hours before checkin which really sucked because we were tired from our trip and wanted to shower and take a quick nap before hitting the beach- Victor at the front desk was great! We didn't have to wait for checkin time, he gave us our room key right away and we totally appreciated that.The staff were great! Felix at the buffet took great care to make sure that our cups were always filled with coffee and that our plates were picked up promptly. They even remembered my sister and I and that I start my morning with a cappuccino! The pizza and pasta guys were the best, they were really quick and super friendly- they would make the pasta and pizza exactly how we wanted!! The staff go out of their way to smile and be super friendly, they engage in convo and will even remember you when you come in.The beach concierge Dennis (Denny) was also great! He does wander around the beach but that's basically his job, not everyone wants his services all the time- but he's never far away and did a great job grabbing me a new towel or a coco loco :)We went to the French restaurant which was really good, and our server Benito and Boris also did a stellar job!The management at the resort are also great. It's nice to know that they around and go out of their way to make you feel welcome, Francisco and Oscar were very friendly.The rooms were clean, but we could have used a couple extra bath towels- that being said, when we called down to concierge to have some more sent up, the service was very speedy!Tips don't seem to be expected- you'd get great service with or without tips- but they really are deserved by the staff.The food at the buffet was good- I've been to a couple other resorts and the food was not nearly as good as it was at the majestic. The buffet is also kept nice and clean, no splatters here and there or flys. I loved the steak house and the gourmet restaurants. The hotel is big but not so big that you couldn't walk from one end to the other, no need for that silly golf cart of people pushing to get on at this resort. The pool is huge and there is a spot in the pool for everyone. The thing I loved is that at anytime you could go to the area of the pool close to the beach and it would be bumping with fun activity and liveliness, but at the same time, you could go to another area of the pool and get total peace and quiet! there is something for everyone.We will definatley be back next year!

<Content>fantastic Dominican Republic, Punta Cana, Majestic Colonial.Just fantastic!We have just returned from a 2 week stay at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. Already I wish we were back there.The food was superb (and I'm a very fussy eater), the rooms were immaculate, sheets changed every day, floors mopped, bathrooms cleaned etc etc. My family and I have experienced many all inclusive holidays over the years and to be perfectly honest we had gone off the idea of all inclusive as drinks  food over the years had become dreadful.We booked this holiday very last minute after checking it out on Trip Advisor. I can honestly say it is the best and most entertaining holiday I have ever experienced. The shows were excellent especially The Michael Jackson Show(not to be missed). The animation team worked really hard and every single member was extremely friendly and welcoming. We would especially like to thank Miguel, Henry, Jesus, Pablo, Geidy, Samuel, Kiko, Nelson, Taison, Alex, Andres  Kelly for making our holiday (especially our daughters) a memory we will treasure forever.At this hotel there are only 2 restaurants, the Japenese and the Gourmet for which you require a reservation, all of the others, Steak, Seafood, chinese, Mexican  Domincan and the Buffet restaurants you just turn up at your leisure.........FANTASTIC!!!The whole complex, hotel, gardens, pool and beach are to die for. Everything is so clean and well cared for, even our drinks were well known brands not cheap alternatives.My family and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.Thank you very much to one and all at the Majestic Colonial.Kindest RegardsKim, Phil  Chelsey Capewell from Berkshire England.

<Content>Great Hotel! Would go again! Hi,We have just returned from Majestic ( Oct 27 - Nov 4). At first we had have reservations of going there with a 2 year old todler...but it turned out to be great! The staff is great with kids - they love kids in Dominican, there are always high chairs available, milk was given to us upon request, and there is a kids disco at 8:30 p.m. every night which lasts 30 minutes - that was a nice break for the parents. The beach is great with white sand and the waives are not too high - so you are able to swim. The food was ok - We liked the Fish Restaurant on the Beach - very fresh fish and lobsters.Pool is great - its huge. Lots of entertainment during the day from the staff.We got a room in Building beside the construction and it did not bother us at all - the room had an ocean view ( which we did not pay for) - so it was great!Would go back!

<Content>Loved the Majestic Wow, this hotel was great! The pool is an oasis of beauty, it truly is. We received welcome cocktails and cold washcloth upon arrival and there is a jacuzzi in each room. The staff was friendly and MIKE TYSON and RALPH and SAMUAL ADAMS were the BEST, tell them Colette from New Jersey misses them very much. I just got back on 11/03 and stayed from 10/27/07-11/03/07. I arrived right in the middle of hurrican noel, but even that could not put a damper on the beautiful majestic. The food was better than any all inclusive i had ever been at ever. People, this is the carribean so stop being so critical...ENJOY! I did se the Micahel Jackson show, and it really was a great show, so be sure to catch it. The entire staff was smiling and saying hola at each and every encounter. And Ralph remembers everyone's name. The beach is gorgeous and the grounds are impeccible. I have not a bad word to say about the majestic, agreed the mini-mart prices are insane a bottle of suntan lotion was $20.00 and a club soda was over $3.00. I would have liked to been able to rent a movie off of the TV and charge it to the room, remember I was there for four days during a hurricane. My room was 2211 and it was beautiful. I received a massage at the spa and it was to die for, GREAT and well worth the price $80.00 for one hour. So, please go and enjoy the majestic as I did, I will be returning soon.

<Content>Awesome!!! My husband and I stayed at the Majestic from 10/27 to 11/2. We arrived around the same time tropical storm Noel did. Even though we got rain for a day and a half we enjoyed our stay and the animation team did an excellent job of keeping everyone entertained.Our check-in was flawless. We upgraded to a swimout room and thought it was well worth the extra money. It was extremely convenient to have the pool outside our patio, and we were still very close to the beach. On our first night the staff sent over a big platter of cheese, fruit and some champagne, our second night they sent sushi and wine, all very tasty.The rooms are beautiful, well appointed. We did have a minor leak in our room but the Majestic staff had someone fix it immediately and all went well.The Michael Jackson show is a must. They did a fabulous job.The only thing I was amazed with was the food. It was a little bland. I must say that the Grill, Le Gourmet and the Japanese restaurants were really good. Overrall, this resort was awesome. The people are nice and extremely friendly. I would definetly go back. I highly recommend this resort.

<Content>The Majestic is Majestic Trip Advisor was very beneficial to us when booking our trip so I want to return the favor.We were at the Majestic from 10-27-07 and arrived home last night 11-3-07. It was a wonderful stay.You pay a $10.00 fee per person when you enter the Punta Cana airport , pick up your luggage, hop in a cab and you are at the resort in 35 minutes and the charge was $35.00. We were greeted at the hotel with a cold washcloth and a nice cold drink. Check in was very smooth and we went to our room - 2223 - and the view was wonderful. (Thanks Emily - I did e mail her the week before we went with my request.) We were right in the middle of the resort. and I could not have been happier with the room.Ask for a room in Building 2 (preferably) or #3. Building one looks over a parking lot and building 4 looks out to the construction of the new Majestic now being built and is expected to open December of 2008. It will be an adults only. If I had a room in building 1 or 4, I would not have been happy.The pool is absolutely beautiful and huge. No one played the Saving Chair Game and the chairs were plentiful at the pool and beach. Also there were many huts available,. The beach is just beautiful but just be careful - at times it can be a little rough Right in front of the hote the beach is rocky - just walk to the right of the beach and there are hardly any rocks there..Breakfast was good - could be a little warmer - and also lunch. We ate at the Steak House and the first night was great but the second trip there was only so-so. The service at that restaurant the second night we went was just ok. We went to the French Restaurant twice - what can I say - it was excellent. We made the reservations for the French Restaurant the morning we wanted to eat dinner there and had no problems with getting reservations.We sat on the beach for 7 days and never once did the server on the beach ask if we wanted a drink He seemed to be just wondering. This was really not a problem but this is one area where I think the Majestic can improve. When you walk to the beach bar - there is only one bartender and you have several people in line waiting for drinks. When the line was too long at the beach bar - we then had to walk to the pool bar to get a drink. This is one area where they can improve the hotel - put another bartender or two at the beach bar and on the beach,A couple of suggestions: Bring a lot of ones, use the room safe at all times - bring lots of suntan lotion - it was $20.00 in the Mini Mart and most importantly - be careful of walking. I can not tell you how many people fell on the ceramic or marble floors. We saw at least four people in wheel chairs with their foot bandaged. The floor at the hotel and in the room are extremely slippery - especially when you are a little wet.There is entertainment in the Courtyard every night which was a great thing. There was a band playing and also a sax player and pianist. It was great to go and listen to the music before dinner and afterward.The only show we saw was the Michael Jackson show - very good.One of the reasons I am not giving this a five star is because towards the end of our week - the service was a little lax and I am not sure why. We had to search for bowls for the ice cream or soup and I can not tell you how many times we asked for Sodas or Coffee and we never got what we asked for. Also at times the buffet looked like it could use a little freshening up. Do not eat the hamburgers - they were gross.The bathroom situation is not as bad as I read about here, however if you are traveling with older children - there is absolutely no privacy in getting changed and this could create a problem. However the shower is huge and you can always get changed in there.This is a wonderful resort and the works are great and I would definitely go back again but this is the reason for a review - you want the good and bad..

<Content>Experience the Friendliness My husband and I stayed ath the Majestic from10/27 to 11/02. We arrived at the same time as Tropical Storm Noel! But, even Noel couldn't put a damp on this beautiful hotel. We give the staff at the Majestic a big Thumbs up! Everyone was extemely nice and friendly, especially Keyla at the reception desk who made everything possible to change our room because we wanted to be closer to the beach. She promised she would change us the next day, and she did!. When you walk through the hotel and you bump into a member of the staff , you always get a bright smile accompany by a hola greeting. This an all inclusive and no tips are expected, but the waiters are all super friendly and go out of their way to serve you. Even though they don't expect to be tipped, it's really appreciated when you do.The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The beach was gorgeous and clean. The water a bit cold due to the tropical storm. But, the winner at this hotel is the pool, which is incredibly beautiful. We almost forgot to mention the Animation Team, which despite the weather kept people entertained at all times. Our only dissappointment was the food which wasn't really that great. We loved the Gourment and the Oriental Teppanyaki, but the rest was really not that great. There wasn't enough variety for a five star hotel.We will definitely go back to the Majestic again.

<Content>Gorgeous Resort-Wonderful Staff My husband and I stayed at this resort October 10-16th. This resort is beautiful. We have been to the Dominican Republic 3 times and this resort is our favorite.Pros: The welcome and check-in was flawless. After we got our key and packet, Juan escorted us around the property and to our room. There was a beautiful fruit platter and bottle of champagne waiting. The room was clean and just as shown on Tripadvisor website.The food was very good at the Caribbean restaurant, Japanese restaurant and French. The buffet was average to above average. The staff was very pleasant and most helpful at all. They also are most friendly.Our room was clean by noon everyday and we had a partial ocean view-room 3343. I wrote a note in Spanish with my bar request and some tip money and received the extra waters and beer. I also did the same with the maid and got the extra towels and soaps as we showered at least twice a day.Language is not a problem but I took the time to brush up on my Spanish and it was greatly appreciated by the staff.Cons: The sports bar had no air conditioning when we were there and the Fox channel has no sound-so if you want to watch your team play on Sunday-that could be a problem. We were not there to watch television but my husband did want to catch 1/2 of his football. Our electricity went out just as dusk was arriving on our second day-they had an electrician there immediately and after I called about the problem they immediately sent a platter of sushi and a bottle of wine. So the customer service was really excellent.The beach is gorgeous-enjoy your trip!

<Content>Nice resort, too many room problems, no suites available. My family and cousins stayed here from Oct 28th to Nov 1st. There were 8 of us, 5 adults and 3 kids (5,3,2). The good: Beach was beautiful. Plenty of chairs available, activities all the time. Be careful with kids, waves were great but a little rough. Water was clear and blue.Food was mostly good. Breakfast buffet was very nice, lots of choices. Lunch buffet at beach was average but convenient for kids.French cafe was the best.We had trouble getting early time for dinner reservations which we needed for young kids. First times start at 6:30 but those were gone pretty quick.Kids explorer club was nice with slide. Only a few kids were there. Not really sure how to sign up for it so we just went there one day and played. It's as far away from the beach as possible so beware. There was a show at 8:30 for the kids each nite and they got to dance on stage with Maria, she was excellent. Also, had a very nice Halloween show where they dressed up the kids and they loved it, have to rate this as the best part of the trip. The disco bar also had some Halloween stuff and many of the staff had masks on. Also had nightly movies for the kids.The bands that played at night were also very talented, but loud. Everything there is loud, loud, loud.The bad:First of all, since we requested adjoining rooms we were probably limited as to which rooms they could put us in. That being said, when we got there, they didn't have us in adjoining rooms but they had us facing the gardens across from the pool. When we requested to have adjoining rooms, they scrambled a bit to find us something. The manager took us to see the rooms (after requesting a few people to run in and clean them up). They were fine but faced the construction side. I asked if we could upgrade to a Majestic suite and they said NONE were available. I'm not sure how the rest of these people upgraded rooms (although with kids some upgrades were not available). We asked several times about upgrades but no rooms were available and supposedly the resort was only 60% full. I think they put us in some rooms that were not quite ready or had problems they didn't want us to know about (4205 and 4204). One room had damp beds and lights not working. The other had no a/c and the worker was trying to fix it at 11:00pm at night while the kids were trying to sleep. The phone also didn't work.After the first day, most of the problems were fixed. One other thing, the music was so loud from the stage shows that you could hear the dj from the room at 11:00pm. Guess people without kids wouldn't care.After asking over and over for and upgrade, which there were none available, I asked (was not offered) for SPA certificates and finally received 5 - 25 minute gift certificates for massage which was very nice from Antonia, the manager. The massages were very relaxing. I guess I was talking to the wrong people because everyone else writing reviews seemed to have no problems getting free room upgrades.Oh yes, think someone else mentioned this. The walking areas are VERY, VERY slippery, especially if there's been rain. They have several little signs everywhere saying 'slippery' but still, be careful, kids and adults, flip flops are the worst for this.Overall, after the first night, trip was great. We had no Spanish speakers in our group so we were confused as to where things were and when, especially kids activities. They had a wall listing all of the activiites and times but if you had questions it was sometimes difficult to get answers. Would be nice to have one area or person for us pathetic Engligh speaking people to get info.It's good walk from the beach to main resort where the breakfast buffet is, so you might consider this when requesting a room. Most of the night activities are around the main lodge.I'm really not knocking this resort and it's my first time to the Dominican so I can't compare it to anything else. The first night was hell and after that, we really had minor issues. We were deciding between Sunscape, Gran Bahia (which is next door) and here. Sunscape was too far away (and they had several complaints of people getting sick). Gran Bahia, we were told, was not as nice as here and the food was not as good. I might try there next time since the reviews there are all good plus it's much less expensive since I believe there is only 1 type of room, no real upgrades available.

<Content>Majestic Colonial Punta Cana- FABULOUS! Our stay at the Majestic from 10/20-10/28/07 was wonderful! The resort is beautiful and the staff are extremely friendly. We were greeted by Laura at the front desk who showed us around the resort and to our room. We were also given the famous Majestic Sunset cocktail upon arrival which is really tasty! The room:Our Jr. suite was nice, just like it appears in all of pictures posted by other reviewers. The open bathroom area was not a problem for us, we are married after all! If you think this may be a problem for those you are traveling with, I would suggest getting separate rooms. One thing I never read anyone mention had to do with the alarm clock. When you leave your room, the power is shut off in the room (except for the AC) and it turns back on when you re-enter. So every time we came back to the room we had to reset the clock. It might be beneficial to bring a 9-volt battery to put in the alarm clock so you don鈥檛 have to bother resetting it so many times. The satellite TV was also hit or miss. Sometimes it was working and a lot of times it was not. But since we were on vacation and there were so many other things to do, this was not really that big of a deal.The pool and beach:The pool and the beach are fabulous. No matter how many people were at the pool, it was never crowded and you could always find a spot with lots of swimming room. The beach also had tons of lounge chairs, but you have to get there early to get one under an umbrella. There isn鈥檛 really a hot tub (unless you enter the spa area) which was a little bit of a let down. There is a bubbly area of the pool though that they show on the resort map as a Jacuzzi.The food:The buffet always had tons of food and a lot of variety. The food wasn鈥檛 always piping hot, but it was always good. The Gourmet Restaurant was our favorite. We had the filet of beef and it was delicious! We went to the Japanese restaurant but it was somewhat disappointing. There wasn鈥檛 really a 鈥渟how鈥?as others had mentioned. The chef just cooked the food and then watched while we ate. The food was pretty good, but not stellar. We tried the Chinese restaurant and it too was just OK. Nothing to write home about. The fried ice cream was good though! We loved the steakhouse (Rodeo Grill), the food was great and we loved that it was outside with a view of the beach. The Mexican restaurant was really good also and also has a little buffet so if you didn鈥檛 like your entr茅e, there were other things you could eat. We didn鈥檛 try the seafood restaurant since my husband doesn鈥檛 eat seafood, but heard it was good.The spa:I went to the spa one day for a hot stone massage and a pedicure. The hot stone massage was out of this world! I have never had a better massage. You even get a facial at the end of the massage! The pedicure was not as great. They are lacking some technology in that area, but my toes still looked beautiful afterwards.The entertainment:The Michael Jackson show was by far the best of the shows we attended. I would recommend everyone who stays here to see it. The 70s/80s Rewind show was also pretty good. The other shows we saw were somewhat boring, but you have to hand it to those guys for trying so hard to entertain so many people from different cultures. There were always activities going on by the pool and beach during the day as well. We didn鈥檛 participate, but it was entertaining to watch. The animation team really does try hard to make sure the guests have a good time.The staff:The staff at the resort are all very helpful and friendly. They were always there waiting to take an empty plate or refill a glass. Most speak at least a little English, but even the ones that didn鈥檛 we were able to communicate with on a pretty basic level.Excursions:Our tour operator was Prieto Tours, so I can only comment on the excursions they offer. We went on the Caribbean Festival and Jeep Safari. Both were excellent! I definitely recommend the Jeep Safari, you get to do a little of everything and get to see a lot of how Dominicans really live. Just bring lots of food or candy for the many children that will be begging when you come in their area. We also went out on our own one day to the Hard Rock Caf茅 and the shopping center adjacent to it. We just got a taxi in front of the resort. It cost $20 each way and the taxi driver that takes you will offer to come back whenever you want to pick you up. If you are looking to shop, it is not really a great place to go. There are only a few shops and they are really small (not to mention expensive). I would recommend just going there to eat at the Hard Rock or the Tony Roma鈥檚 and that鈥檚 it. I would have your driver come back in two hours maximum as there is not much to do there.Overall, we had a great time and would recommend the resort to all types of travelers. We would definitely stay at the Majestic again if we return to Punta Cana.

<Content>Fabulous! We travelled from October 7th to the 14th. Just want to say, this resort is one of the best resorts I have ever been to. We travel twice a year, been to at least 8 Riu resorts all 5* plus, Grand Bahia's, Cuba-Sandals, this resort was hands down one of the best. There is nothing bad to say about it, the food, the drinks, the rooms, one of the cleanest pools ever, the beach the wedding we attended, the staff, all amazing. We had such a great time, we are going back for our group Spring trip the beginning of May. Donna  Tom, Toronto - Canada

<Content>First class resort - Majestic Colonial Punta cana - excellent service My husband and I have just returned home from a magnificent 10 days in the Dominican Republic! We stayed at the Majestic Colonial resort in Bavaro Beach, where we met one of your emplyees, Jenny, who works in Guest services....she was not only helpful and extremely accomodating, but so outgoing and friendly! She went out of her way to help us with reservations, and information, and we are happy to have met her! Jenny is truly an asset to your organization, and wanted her to be recognized for her wonderful qualities! Laureen and Tom TaylorJamison, PA

<Content>Good - But Not Great Have just returned from a week's vacation at the Majestic and while it was enjoyable, I honestly cannot say that there was anything special or unusual about the resort. I have stayed in Punta Cana many times and always at 4 1/2 to 5 star resorts. The best resort I've stayed at was the Paradissus, which you would expect considering the price. However I have paid less at other resorts along the strip and found them just as good and better than the Majestic. I am not sure why there is so much hype about this resort. It does not have the best stretch of beach, in fact there are rocks (many) in the water to the left of the resort, so if you want to swim you must move over to the left. I have never seen rocks anywhere before on Bavaro Beach. Most of the restaurants are just ok, the asian one is the best. The buffet definitely leaves a lot to be desired - food wise and atmosphere. The beach restuarant is positively awful - cannot even serve hot french fries - I just got tired of eating pasta every day. The rooms are large - furniture not particularly nice, kind of cheap looking and for the length of time this resort has been operating the covers on the bed and furniture are terribly shabby. There were large stains on the furniture in my room. Also the bathroom setup up would not suit most people - too open - who needs to hear your partner in the bathroom! The shows are pretty awful, the only good one was the Michael Jackson show, the rest of the shows were just awful and I am not hard to please. On the positive side, the pool is lovely and the service is good. You would not starve at this resort, of course you can always find something to eat and you can have fun in the pool and on the beach - but for the extra money they charge it is simply not worth it. This resort is just an average four star, but that's just my opinion.

<Content>Perfect! We just returned from our Honeymoon at the Majestic Colonial and had a fantastic experience. The staff was more than accomodating and made such an effort to make our honeymoon memorable - from champagne and fruitplate upon arrival to a romantic poolside private dinner and private in-room breakfast, they aim to please! I had read unpleasant reviews regarding food but found all of the restaurants to be wonderful. Taino was a little lacking for me, but only because I am not very adventurous and it was more local cuisine. (Goat stew, etc.) Our room was clean and beautiful and the housekeeping staff made sure we were always well stocked. We were ocean front and the view on the beach is amazing. Many topless individuals which was a shock to us, as Americans, but we joined the trend by the end of the week and really enjoyed ourselves. We met great couples who were also honeymooning. We were so exhausted we didn't make it to many shows but we heard the Michael Jackson one was the best. We saw the 70-80's themed one and were impressed. We definitely recommend this place to anyone and will be planning a return trip. Don't miss out - great quality for the money! *One word of advice, don't expect too much on the excursions. They are good to see the countryside and to get away but the snorkeling, etc is very touristy. Swimming with the sharks and stingrays was very sad but the entertainment on the boat was great.

<Content>Wonderful time at the Majestic Colonial Went to the Majestic Colonial Oct 21 - 25 for our 32nd Anniversary trip. We arrived late afternoon due to a problem at JFK with our Airbus. We were warmly welcomed with a Majestic drink and check in was very quick. Sofia took us to our room #4406 which was beautiful until I looked out the balcony and terrace and saw all the construction of the new Majestic Elegance going up next door. Plus, we were way in the back of the resort. I was sad and the hubby went down to see if we could possibly move. Since the hotel wasn't full and not in season we were very lucky that the Manager Mr. Ramirez offered us an upgrade for no extra money. ( I love this man!!!) The next room was gorgeous #2350 and up at the ocean. We had our complimentary bottles of rum, whiskey and champagne waiting for us plus the fruit and cheese plates. :-) We had a large terrace with jacuzzi outside plus the beautiful suite with jacuzzi indoors too. The animation team was a lot of fun with the games at the pool which is where we spent most of our time. The pool is huge and beautiful and runs all the way from the beach to the lobby. It's quiet in the back section if you are there for just rest and relaxation. The pool bar was great and the bartenders very nice with no wait for your drinks. The waitresses came around to your lounge chairs often also. The beach was very nice and breezy so we would take a short late afternoon nap there before going in to get ready for dinner and the evening show. The Michael Jackson show was the best as stated by many others. We had somegreat audience participation in the other evening shows that made for many good laughs. The food was very good and yes there are some strange looking foods there especially at the buffet but you had many entrees to choose from. I enjoyed dining at Le Gourmet and had the filet mignon. I also loved the ChateauBriand at the Steak House on the beach. Don't miss trying the pasta bar too. Our favorite drinks were the Majestic, Coco Loco, Dirty Monkey and Miami Vice made at the lobby bar by Pablo or Vincent. We tipped all the time so our drinks were always very good and restaurant service very attentive. The mini bar is just a chilling box and not a real refrigerator so keep your ice bucket full. Their coffee is very strong so I had to drink it half coffee and half milk. The maid did a nice job in the room as did the guy who fills up the mini bar. Remember tips for them too. We did not go off the resort since we were there for a quick stay. According to the applause at the evening shows each night it sounded like there were mostly Americans there for our days visiting with Spain coming in #2. We had no problem with the employees speaking English to us. I have heard in season there will be mostly Europeans there. I would definitely recommend the Majestic to all my friends to stay at.

<Content>A fabulous vacation!! We just got back from a 6 day trip to Punta Cana and couldn't have been happier with our vacation. The other reviews of this hotel are very accurate and can be relied on. I have some additional comments: Food: Overall we were very pleased with the food choices. There were many choices for breakfast so everyone should be able to find something. The local coffee was very strong! We ate at the Steakhouse 3 times during our visit and 2 out of the 3 we ordered the Chateubriand. It was fabulous and I wouldn't suggest ordering anything else. We also were very please with Le Gourmet and ended up making reservations there twice. We were pleased with the menu choices as well as the wine list. We also at at Taino one night -- a sit-down, no reservation necessary, Mexican/Domincan fare place. The fajitas and burrito were very good. Food is available around the clock EXCEPT from 6-630pm. It is the only time of day that there is nothing available. I would suggest packing snacks to have in the room in case you are a grazer and get hungry for snacks. I didn't feel that there were many options for a small snack during non meal time hours. It was especially difficult to find something that wasn't deep fried. Casino:We were very disappointed in the attitudes we encountered of the dealers in the Casino. It may be that they are taught to stay quiet and not socialize with the players, but we felt that the overall feel was not fun. The cards were dealt very quickly and there was no casual banter so once we lost, we left and didn't go back. From previous experiences with gambling, it's more fun when the dealer interacts with the players more so than they did at the resort. However, since we did not go there only to gamble this did not put a damper on our trip. Pool/Activities: There is definitely something going on at all times during the day. The only thing we noticed after a couple of days around the pool is that there is no variation in music, which got a little annoying. The same upbeat songs are used multiple times during the day for the various activities. If you tend to pay attention to music, as we did, you will probably find this annoying as well. The staff does a great job getting people involved though!Overall: I felt that this was definitely a 5 star hotel. From the moment we arrived, we were treated very well by the staff and wanted for nothing. The rooms were clean and large; the pool was absolutely wonderful and the beach was as tropical as you can imagine. We had a wonderful and relaxing trip and I would highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for an afforable, deluxe vacation.

<Content>Majectic Colonial Experience Just returned from the Majestic Colonial Resort in Punta Cana(10/20/07 to 10/27/07. Had a great time, but also had some issues. The resort rated as a 5* or 6*, but was overall a 4*, due mainly to the quality or lack thereof of the dinner food. It was basically buffet quality, even in the separate fine dining restaurants). Not one of them had decent food. However, breakfast and lunch was very good. The resort structure itself was beautiful. The rooms were large and well appointed except for lounging chairs and missing desks shown in the marketing material. Large complex, but you need to walk off the booze and food. The pool area was great. The beach and water was the best, just gorgeous. The side trips for the most part were overpriced for what you received in return. The Outback on ATV's was a nice take to see the countryside. I would return to this facility but with slightly lower expectations. As a side note: topless was pretty much the norm here, but absolutely no problems unless your a female visiting from the USA. They have too many hangups with body images or privacy. Go and enjoy this two year old resort keeping in mind the above and you will truly enjoy your stay.

<Content>Simply Majestic... We just returned from a week long stay in Punta Cana at the Majestic Colonial. For a 4-star hotel, this place provided a 5-star service and everything was available at all hours of the days and nights. The hotel provided plenty of activities during the day and night at no extra cost but also offered off campus excursions for an additional price. We did not engage in any off those. They seemed a bit pricey. My wife participated in the pool aerobics and dance classes every day, while the men enjoyed volleyball and water polo. Plenty of seating with and without shade is available by the pool and beach. The sun can be brutal, pack a lot of sun-screen. Upon arrival, you're greeted with a drink called La Majestic and cool wet towels. You can make this drink alcoholic by telling them to add rum. It鈥檚 offered non-alcoholic for the obvious reasons. This drink is the staple of the hotel and must say, it beats your standard pina-coladas and Hawaiian punches. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful with all our needs. Since the hotel is never fully booked or over booked, majority of the room views will be either full ocean view or partial ocean view rooms. The rooms with partial ocean view, face the pool and that in itself is just as pretty a view. Our room had a Jacuzzi in it. The room bar is complete with candy bars, water, soda and beer and is replenished every day. Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner: The hotel requires you to make reservations for The French and Japanese restaurants...MAKE'EM. They are upscale and the food is delicious. Japanese food was the best, followed by the French and all others are pretty standard. Between those two, the steakhouse, seafood and buffet, it turned out to be enough variety for a week long stay. The steakhouse and seafood place is huge and therefore divided into two sides. They鈥檙e both on the beach. You can always ask them to serve you dinner on the beach with timely advanced notice. You can have dinner under the moonlight on the beach while being serenaded by a musician. Breakfast: Two places were open. Almost like a college cafeteria with different stations offering different types food, but better quality than your normal college cafe. Eggs, fruits, juices, bakery, meat, low-carb/diet stations and cooks if you want something made especiallyfor you.Lunch: There is a choice of few places, but if you're baking in the sun at the pool or the beach and after having a late breakfast and drinking all morning, anything is edible. A sandwich, pizza slices usually sufficed, but there is more.If you're in an All-Inclusive package, the concept of tipping is almost non-existent. But we did leave tips for the staff we got to know over the 6 days, and the ones that went beyond their service delivery, especially the bartenders and maids. Go see Pablo and Frances at the plaza bar. This package includes the shuttle to and from the Punta Cana airport to your hotel. Depending what hotel you鈥檙e staying at, it can take anywhere from 15mins to an hour to get there. Don鈥檛 bother renting a car, the roads are smaller and local drivers are erratic and there is no sense of direction when driving. Nightlife: Casino, Disco  Sports Bar, Local Shows. Nothing extravagant, but still well put together. This is a vacation spot for a little R  R, if you're looking for a wild night life; visit the other side of the island. This place died down around 11:30pm...but started hopping around 6:30pm, just before dinner. Currency Exchange: Don't bother converting, take the dollars.

<Content>Nice Hotel This is a very nice hotel.The service was very good, the staff very friendly, the food was good as well.We arrived on Oct. 19th, check in was fast and easy. We were greeted with a drink and cold towel and then escorted to our room by the girl at the front desk. As we walked she pointed out the hotels restaurants and bars, This was very nice as we didn't have to go searching on our own.The room was clean and spacious and there was a bottle of champange waiting. In the afternoon, we received a fruit plate.The next day a bottle of wine and sushi. The third day we got a call from Angela to make sure everything was ok and if we needed anything (this was a nice touch)The beach is simply amazing, clean and we never had a problem find a spot in the sun or shade.The weather was perfect as well.The food was good as well...not what we are use to in North America, remember you are in the Dominican. we did not have any language problems, seems that everyone that served you spoke some English and you are able to communicate.I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Perfect Wedding and Honeymoon for us and all our guests!!! We just got back from our Wedding and Honeymoon at the Majestic!! One word - phenomenal! We actually booked our Honeymoon at the Excellence, and once we got there after a week at the Majestic, we made some calls and went back there!We had 56 guests join us from MA, FL, SC, MI, and Canada and everyone of them had a blast! We had been planning our wedding with the wedding coordinator, Larissa. I'm very type A and had graphs, charts, and several questions... but Larissa and her team took care of everything wonderfully!! We met with her the day we arrived (Thursday) for a Saturday wedding. We confirmed everything we had planned a head of time and decided on the few things we hadn't.We stayed in a gorgeous suite! All our guests had great rooms. We did have a rehearsal in the Chapel and a rehearsal dinner to follow on the Friday night. It was in the Main Buffet but set up and decorated beautifully for 24 of us! The day of the wedding it poured but Larissa had a plan b and everything went better than we could have hoped. We had a blast at our own wedding. Details for any brides out there: the resort steamed my dress and husband's suit; the flowers were expensive but GORGEOUS; the photographer Kiko.... late but AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!; the food at the reception was delicious; our service was excellent; the DJ played from the music we brought and worked out great....what else? We did have to move the reception from outdoors to one of the meeting rooms which ended up being great because it was so hot and so humid from the rain, this way we had A/C at least. I did do my own make-up which Jama advised - but the girls did an awesome job with all our hair - 7 of us total and all different lengths  types.They spoiled us for 2 weeks. Most of our guests stayed 5-7 nights and we all had so much fun! Denny at the Beach, the whole Animation Team, Jorge at the Piano Bar, the servers at all the restaurants.... soooo good to us! The management team as well - Jose and Victor especially.There was a Tour Operator representing one of the vendors who booked our trip, her name is Jama, and she was American. She was a lifesaver giving us all kinds of info and tips...we became very friendly!! She took care of so many little things for us - someone forgot their book of vouchers; someone's was wrong; she helped us get back to the Majestic when the Excellence disappointed us!The guys went golfing the morning of the wedding to a Golf Course called La Cana Golf Course. on the water and absolutely loved it!!!! They said it was worth every penny.Everyone was so nice to us and took great care of us. The Majestic in addition to the champagne breakfast and romantic dinner you receive as bride and groom, also took care of a couple's massage and romantic dinner on the beach for us! Both were fabulous and you can't go without doing either!! The dinner on the beach was very special!So back to the Excellence.... we were so focused on planning the wedding at the Majestic that maybe we didn't give enough thought to the Excellence, but we had heard great reviews. It was very disappointing. First, we had to wait almost an hour for our room after we arrived (after a hot and scary 45 minute cab ride); the room there was half the size of one of the ones at the Majestic - with no working A/C!!!; our ocean front room that we payed a small fortune for was actually a view of the market next door (we were on the end) on the other side of the barb wire fence - dogs barking here and there was actually a sign on one of the hut's that said WALMART!! (not honeymoonish); the ocean was off to the right if you stretched your neck; the sheets were dirty; and the whole place a run-down/ dirty look to it. We tried to walk around - no one was friendly like at the Majestic and the last straw was when we tried visiting the beach and even the table there had old napkins stuck to it and was dirty!! So were able to get out of there and the Majestic put us up in an even larger suite with a hot tub on a private roof. They were so good to us.Everything at the resort was very clean, very discreet. The pool and beach chairs almost magically got straightened up they were so in the background! Our party tipped a lot too which I'm sure helped but what $5 is to us compared to what it was to them! The chateau briaund (spelling?) at the Steak House was to die for. The French restaurant was excellent too....they all were. The only one we didn't go to was the Mexican.We are planning on starting a vacation club so that we can all go back in 1 or 2 years!!

<Content>Majestic Service We have been all over the Caribbean and this is our first ever entry into 'Trip Advisor'. No question that the most important element to all of our vacations has been to get to know someone with pull at the front desk immediately upon arrival. At the Majestic we were fortunate enough to meet Keyla who proved herself to be an immense help with any of our requests.  If you travel looking to get the best possible value as we do, then you know your trip quality will be amplified by making an effort to be friendly and courteous to hotel staff. Practice simple Spanish before you come here as English not that strong overall, new hotel, new staff it seems. New hotel is very key to room quality and you won't be disappointed. Get a pool view! As for the Majestic we found it a great combination of many resorts previously visited. The size allows the ability to walk to all destinations, very important to myself with one ailing foot. The variety of food along with location and availability within the resort are also key. The benefit of not requiring long pants at every night venue allowed extra luggage space and a relaxed feel all week not being pressured to make reservations. The beach bar is more of a restaurant so dress for lunch but the Pasta Chef at lunchtime is worth it.  If you are a fan of nice pools then this is your spot. If you are a major beach lover then the Grand Bahia next door may be more your speed. GB is much larger and room placement is very key there as to whether you get a seat on the tram or not. Great resort but stay right at the beach or up top, not in the middle part, trust me. We got moved to the beach and loved it. The Majestic we found more friendly and social. The Theatre is far superior with service right to your table. Night life is right next to the theatre along with a snack bar being open late with food and drinks. Premium Canadian drinks available throughout the resort. The service and smiles made this trip a good one. The couples we met went on day trips and seemed to have good things to say. The half day snorkel with Sharks was a big hit. Snorkeling the beach for shells was enough for me! They are building a brand new Majestic Excellence next door so will definitely try that in the future. We have to say overall yes we will return, thanks to Keyla and people like her who can create a great vacation from an already good one.

<Content>Loved the Majestic and Can't wait to return!!!! We have just returned from a week long stay (Oct. 13-20th) at the Majestic Colonial and had a marvelous time. We traveled with our 20 month old daughter and my parents. We all cannot say enough amazing things about the resort, staff, beach, pool, restaurants, etc. I have been to other inclusive resorts and I never liked standing in lines in the mornings to make reservations for a la carte restaurants. At the Majestic you only needed to make reservations for one restaurant . You never had a problem getting a reservation for this restuarant either. If you wanted to eat at the Japanese restuarant you needed a reservation there as well. However, we got in w/ out one b/c a couple didn't show up. A lot of people were successful with that approach. If you are interested in the hibachi dinner, make your reservation when you arrive as there are only 3 tables for 10 guests each.The beach: never have to run to get a chair early in the morning: tons of chairs and huts for you to choose from. Super clean and gorgeous! Restaurants: 7 to choose from!Pool: huge, again, a lot of chairs everywhere.Rooms: very clean and spacious even if the tub is in the middle of the room. I really don't know why people have to complain about mattresses and air conditioning. All were fine. And really, who cares about these trivial things? You're not at home anyway. Bars: All over the placeStaff: Amazing! They were amazing w/ our daughter and super attentive to her. High chairs were always available as well as milk. Bartenders were givings us boxes of milk for our fridge for our room. Everything is in walking distance at this beautiful resort. THey thought of everything. Suggestions off of other tripadvisor reviews were very helpful, like tiping bar tenders, housekeeping. insulated mugs for drinks, bug spray (didn't really need it though), bring rafts or floats from home (very expensive in mini mart) I did find one floating in the pool and used that. Thursday night vendors come to sell their products from 3 pm-10pm. YOu must bargain, bargain, bargain. I found their products to be expensive. Maybe taking a trip to the plaza might be worth it. I didn't do it so I'm not sure.We stayed in building three and had an amazing view of the pool. I booked through Costco and they did a wonderful job. Feel free to email me with any questions.

<Content>Didn't want to leave!! After much research, my husband and I stayed at the Majestic for 6 nights for our honeymoon during September 2007. We got there and we greeted with a fruity drink and a towel to wipe our hands. When we got to our room we realized there were ants on the counters and tables, we called the front desk and they said we could change rooms the next day. Everything was handled well, we ended up getting an even better view of the pool and we didn't have ants in the new room. (Thanks Victor!)The food was good. Especially the Japanese and French restaurant, which you need reservations for. I probably gained 5 lbs. The drinks were good too. The disco was just ok, I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are looking for a place to party every night. Its more laidback and chill. We did have fun at the beach party and learned new dances with the hotel workers, which was a lot of fun.Everybody was very friendly. I couldn't get enough of the pool (its huge) and the beach was like paradise. Oh yeah, the Michael Jackson show made me feel like I really was at an MJ concert. Great place to relax and leave your worries behind~ Can't wait to go back!!!!

<Content>Beautiful Resort! Needs to work on a few things!!! I just returned on Oct 16th and figured I would write a review hoping that someone from the hotel will see this.  When we arrived for check in we were pleasently suprised to find out that we we upgraded to a colonial suite which has a living room, a large patio with a jacuzzi tub, and a large patio on the 4th floor. I prefer higher floors because there are less bugs and the view of the beach/pool was spectacular. Room service was included although the options are very limited. The room was clean and spacious. They really need to work on those beds and pillows though. The pool was immaculate. There is not one bad thing that I can say about that pool. There was always a palapa or just a beach chair in general for that matter. There was always enough room for everybody and never over crowded. Loved that!! The pool is extremely clean. The only issue was the pool bar. It's far unless you are on that side of the pool.  Now the food. We have alot to discuss. There is no snack bar during the day, which baffled me. No place to get a good hot dog, hamburger chicken fingers, chicken sandwich nothing. I know I am not in the US but sometimes you get a little craving for a snack. When they did have hamburgers at the beach restaurant, which was once, they are a mystery. I have no clue what kind of meat those burgers are made from. I don' t think I want to know. The hot dogs were defintately no better. They did have a snack bar from 11pm-6am. Who the heck feels like walking that distance for in the middleof the night. We did it one night because we got extremely hungryand only wound up liking the chicharrones (fried chicken chunks). Please majestic change thoose burgers and get an all day snack bar. This is the only hotel I have ever been to without one. The service is something to be desired. You would wait a good 15 to 20 minutes for someone to even take your order. Alot of times we would just seat ourselves which shouldn't be. Especially for the buffet. The waitresses didn't know who needed drinks etc. Very disorganized !!I went to every restaurant except the french, Le Gourmet. The seafood restaurant was good I had grilled lobster. The steakhouse was delicious get the ny strip.Buffet restaurant was okay. The food was always lukewarm or cold. My boyfriend ate something bad and about 2 hours later he was in the bathroom.The Japanese was okay also. We have definately had better japanese at all inclusives. The real winner for us was the fried ice cream.The Michael jackson show was good and I won $400 at the casino. Thats about all the entertainment I did, but it was fun.The beach is incredible. It was honestly the best beach I have ever been to and I have been everywhere, including Paradisus Palma Real. There are no rocks or seaweed. The waves were a little rough but it was worth it.All in all, this place has the potential to be a great hotel. It just needs a little tweaking. I thoroughly enjoyed my 8 days of relaxation. Thanks for reading!!

<Content>Majestic can't be beat My boyfriend and I stayed at Majestic in May 07  it was our first time with an all inclusive resort and we couldn't have been happier. We booked our vacation with BOOKIT.com and everything was exactly as it was advertised. The rooms: beautiful and comfortable. Our room didn't have the best view but we could still see the beach from our balcony. The bed was comfortable to sleep in and always turned down. The bathroom and separate jacuzziu tub was amazing we went in everynight. We had a regular colonial suit not the one with the outdoor jacuzzi but there were no complaints at all. Our minibar was always stocked and we tipped everyday about $2 which got us a whole lot of good service. The pool/beach: MAGNIFICENT! the pool goes along the entire resort so you never have to worry about being in a crowded pool. There were always chairs available on the beach and by the pool. the beach was also beautiful and full of plenty of places to sun tan. I have to admit that snorkeling on the beach was a lot better than the $30 snorkeling excursion we paid for. Don't get me wrong the excursion was very cool we saw a TON of fish, sharks (in a cage) and sting rays (also caged) however on the beach we saw an eel, crabs, and more of a variety of fish The Food: it was excellent and I was really worried about this because all the reviews told us to pack plenty of pepto, but i didnt need any of it. The only food that wasn't so good was the lunch bc its a buffet. My boyfriend and I LOVED the breakfast so we filled up on that and skipped lunch and went to the restaurants for dinner. The restaurants are fabulous especially the french and japanese one. We were disappointed in the mexican, but it really didnt affect our trip much. Entertainment: All the staff members were very nice and helpful whenver you needed them. We didnt need them much bc we really had no problems at all. At the pool there is alot of entertainment and staff coming around to take pictures with different animals like lizards and macaws. The night shows always had a bunch of people there watching however it was all in spanish and seeing as my boyfriend and i dont speak it we had a little trouble with that. But the michael jackson show was great! We understood that one! All in all Majestic is the best resort for your money. You get plenty and there really is nothing to be dissatisfied with. We are planning to go back in June and cant seem to find another resort that compares to Majestic. So if you need any advice... Choose Majestic! And remember $1 goes a LONG way in the Dominican!

<Content>Majestic Colonial all inclusive hotel and resort My husband and I just got back from spending four days at the Majestic Colonial. We were there from 10/07-10/11/07. We have been to another all inclusive in Punta Cana;Gran Bahia Principe the previous year and wanted to try another hotel. Do we ever regret this decision! To begin with the food is not that great at their Buffet Restaurant, which is the only place you can get a full breakfast. We had a twenty minute wait just to place our order at the Chinese restaurant, which by the way is in the same area as their Japanese restaurant. It got VERY loud in there as apparently the japanese restaurant puts on a great show. Three couples left the restaurant because no one ever bothered to get their order. The best had to be the three managers, yes THREE managers, that could not believe that I dared to complain to about their lousy service. They kept saying that they were understaffed. I don't pay good money for a vacation to get excuses. The housekeeping staff was a joke. Our second night there our room was not cleaned until 7pm and only after I complained to the front desk. Our room safe was locked when we got to the room and after FOUR requests to the front desk did someone come by to open it. The only thing that I can say is that the entertainment was fabulous as well as their discoteque.

<Content>Great hotel with great staff My husband and I stayed here 30th Sept 07 for a week to celebrate our 2 year anniversary and we had a fab time. The people working there were lovely and were always smiling and very friendly. I read many of the reviews prior to booking the hotel and it was because of all the positive feedback that I ultimately booked the Majestic.Positives:- - the people - all very nice and accommodating. - the resort itself - always clean and tidy. - the pool - HUGE and seemed clean. - the room - our room 2347 had a lovely view of the beach and the pool but was a good 7 min walk to the main building. If you have children may be a little far. The jazcuzzi was really nice and I had a relaxing time using it whilst also watching TV! - the food - we actually found most of the food to be good. Breakfast in the main building was great - lots of variety and all fresh. We really enjoyed the French themed resturant and ate there twice. - the shows - the Michael Jackson show is super! Every show was of a high calibre and we throughly enjoyed them. Although at 10pm every night it was a good way to end the day and lead to the disco.Improvements:-- the disco - there were many times when we felt the music played was more geared towards those who worked in the disco rather than the guests! - the gym - had no AC so was hard to work out as it got so hot.My husband did unfortunately get a mild case of food posioning but the onsite doctor was great. She took care of him immediately and within an hour his temp was down and he felt better. This is a great aspect of the hotel esp with all the buffet food which can lead to such cases.Re the toilet issue - I agree with many of those who said that it wasn't a big deal if 1) you are aware of the situation and what to expect and 2) you have an open relationship with your partner. Just take some air freshner like we did and you'll be fine!We booked our trip via cheapcaribbean.com and thought we got a very good deal. If you are looking for a relaxing place with things to do if you want but also with peace and quiet than this hotel is great. We didn't speak a word of Spanish but this was also no issue as everyone spoke very good English.ENJOY!!

<Content>Best Hotel/Entertainment Vacation Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The hotel pictures speak for themselves. It is a beautiful resort, no doubt about that!!! I'll break it down for you:Beach: Clean, golden sand, nice warm and turquoise waters. You can take kayaks for a ride and it's an excellent exercise if you wanna keep in shape during your stay. Lots of lawn chairs and you will never have to look to find an umbrella, there are tons!Hotel Rooms: The best ones we've ever been to. Not only one jacuzzi but 2! One indoor and one outdoor...It's best to get the rooms on the lower level so you have your own private access to the pool.Food: French, Steak house and main buffet a MUST!Entertainment: A special thanks to the entertainment team (Sandy and Jesus) who were CATASTROPHIC! hehe I mean PROFESSIONAL at the Taqui Taqui dance! They are an amazing group of young people, very enthusiastic and I am telling you I've been to many resorts in the Caribbean, and this group really got everyone going. I don't think anyone does not know the taqui dance by now! Amazing competitions and rum give-aways :)All in all, an amazing vacation and I am already planning to go back in January :)

<Content>Georgeous Resort..BUT This was our first trip to DR and we stayed at the Majestic based on the reviews. The hotel is gorgeous and the pictures do not do it justice. The beach was beautiful, the grounds were maintained perfectly and the pool was one of the biggest I've seen. My husband and I were there celebrating our wedding anniversary with another couple and overall we had a good time at the resort. Note: DR is not a place were you can wonder, so pick a hotel that has lots to do. We had one picky eater in our group who didn't have any trouble finding meals to enjoy. I thought the food was very good but being Latin I do favor Caribbean cuisine. Didn't care for the Japanese dining.The rooms were clean and the staff was great, the disco was lots of fun. The only negative that I have would be that the mattresses were very firm and very uncomfortable. We have found this problem in many of the islands with a few exceptions and think that it might be typical.I would go back to the Majestic if staying in Punta Cana again, but I wasn't impressed with the island so probably won't. Also, you should know that October is there rainiest month but we still managed to have a great time!

<Content>Tom/ Atlanta GA - Can't Wait To Return!! My wife and I spent 6 nights at the Majestic during Sept and the stay was truly Majestic. I researched this resort heavily before we went and it truly lived up to it's reputation as #1.Everything mentioned in most reviews was right on - beautiful beach, fabulous pool, good food with a huge selection, nice large and clean rooms, etc, etc.The staff was great! Everyone we ran into was smiling, friendly and eager to help. I believe they really enjoy working there.Victor and his front desk staff, especially Roberto and Juan, were super! Very nice folks who will go out of their way to help make your stay enjoyable.As I'm writing this, we're planning our return trip to the Majestic Colonial for next month - can't get enough of a good thing!

<Content>Destination Wedding We just arrived home this morning from a beautiful place.Our son had informed us late last year that he and his fiance would be getting married in October in Punta Cana, DR. Where???? At the Colonial Majestic Resort in Punta Cana.Our trip was wonderful. We want to highly recommend this resort. The weather was good, The food was plentful andgood. The drinks were everywhere and well prepared.The people that work at Colonial Majestic are what make it so special. The entire staff, and there are many, are friendly and warm people. They will go out of their way to help in every way.When I was stung by a bee on our first day at the gorgeous beach, Tyson was there offering some medicine to sooth theburning on the back of my neck. When we had a problem with our room. ( The drain was stopped up in our shower) Miguel came to help get us a new room!!It would be impossible for me to mention everyone that helped us out. Yet these people at the Majestic Colonial are genuine and want to make sure you have a great vacation. The friendleist people in a resort or Hotel I have ever seen.

<Content>Relaxing Stay BUT.... Just returned from the Beautiful Majestic. Having read all the reviews on this hotel my husband and I were looking forward to a relaxing week. I will first start by saying the resort was beautiful, the pool absolutely incredible. We spent most of our time at the pool. The beach was very nice, always plenty of lounge chairs and huts available.Our room overlooked the pool and bar. A walk to and from the buffets but that was okay. We enjoyed the Gourmet Restaurant, Japanese, Seafood and Steakhouse, the Chinese was just okay. The buffets were afterall buffets always plenty of food.The maid service could have been better, our room was never made up before 4pm which left us we no clean towels after swimming all day. After I spoke with the front desk they told me had they known it could have been done in the morning.Which brings me to the biggest complaint I have for this resort was the lack of information, when we asked the front desk they said the had no maps in english only in german. Only info on what was going on was to go up to the activities board and read it. I would have liked an informational packet in the rooms with times of meals,activites, and shows etc. We have stayed at other all inclusive resorts and had much more info available even the daily weather would have been nice. There was also a lack of snack food in between lunch and dinner..from 3 to 6:30 there was no area available that had snacks. The lack of fans made it feel hotter as the air just lingered in the main building and theater. Highly recommend bringing your own insulated mug they keep your drinks cold longer. We had read to bring a float/raft but didn't wished we had as many couples did and relaxed in the pool. And yes the beds were not the most comfortable to say the least.All in all we had an enjoyable stay. The only waitstaff we found to be outstanding was Cristian...He was the friendliest !!!!

<Content>Deserving of its top rating I chose this based on my budget and the Trip Advisor reviews. I did not come away dissappointed. Its not the best place in the world, but could be the best in Punta Cana.What can I say to add to the other reviews. The beach is superb of course. I like being a little out of the way at an all inclusive instead of seeing hotels next door so that was nice. We walked down to the Bahia, which was my runner up choice and I'm very glad we got what we did. The beach is cool being on a little point and curving around offering lots of room to roam in the water.We never left the resort in our 5 days because we didn't have to. I never had a problem with service. In fact I tipped a 5 on my first day at the beachfront restaurant and recieved excellent service from a nice lady the rest of our time. We ate all of our meals in that palapa because my girl insisted on getting seafood everynight. She thought it was the best food she ever had ( she lives in Russia), I would say it was pretty good but nothing special.The rooms are nice, I guess bordering on luxurious. The walkin shower is a nice touch and the bath next to it is quite relaxing. I'm a clean freak and I found nothing dirty during our stay. The toilet door thing is no big deal, I just took care of that business when she was sleeping hehe. We liked the balcony facing the pool and you could hear the music at night and just watch the resort. Very romantic. The crowd was nice, a mixture of Europeans, North and Latin Americans. We found some Russian families but mostly it was the Italians you notice (they go topless). We liked the people we met...You would have to be quite spoiled to not like this place.

<Content>Absolutely the best hotel you can ask for!!!! Just back from a week at this lovely resort. After reading all the positive reviews I was quite confident it would be nice - but it surpassed our expectations! From the convenient layout, the beautiful landscaping and the huge rooms - we were thrilled. The food was amazing, so many choices and so delicious! The staff is very attentive and always willing to help you make the most of your vacation. This was also the FIRST resort in the Carribean where the entertainment didn't suck!! The shows were very good and very entertaining.One of the differences here as well, was we did not have to worry about reserving chairs on the beach or by the pool - tons to go around so that is another nice bonus.So, don't hesitate to spend some extra $$ and book here - it's well worth it!!!

<Content>Wonderfull Words cannot describe what a wonderful place the Majestic is. The beach is pristine and the pool so large it was never crowded. We had no problem with the food even though the seafood was not up to New England standard. I had my first and last rock lobster.....nothing beats our lobster.The waitstaff was always there to attend to what ever you needed.We had our favorites but all were exceptionally nice.We stayed in room 1149, beach front left of the pool and we could not ask for a nicer room. The buffet dining hall was at the other end of the resort but that was fine with us....it helped walking the food off!I would love to go back but on a flight that does not take you thru Miami....that is a hassel.All in all this vacation was exceptional!

<Content>great hotel Newly weds here! we went to majestic for our honeymoon, what a great experience! The hotel was excellent! The beach was clean, spectacular, soft and relaxing! Bad things first: : as soon as we got there, we couldn't reserve to some of the restaurants. That was a little frustrating given that we tried to reserve the minute we arrived at the hotel. Also; which is very normal, you must be able to speak spanish if you want excellent service. Most of the waiters and staff don't understand much english. If you choose to go on the safari or swiming with sharks it is fun but it is kind of corny and very expensive! and you must be patient! Our room was always well cleaned! We left a tip the 2nd night we were there and then we saw a huge difference in our room. and leave a tip for the mini bar in room (you get more water and stuff!) and one for cleaning staff! Travelors: bring alot of singles for tips! also bring water floats for pool and ocean! Blondes: be careful with your hair, it will turn green by the end of the week, talk to your hair dreeser before going!!!!! If you go shopping : we took a taxi into town to a little shopping center and it was fun but bring your patience. They will be harassing you to buy, it got irretating! and PLEASE BARGIN! They pretty much sell necklaces, cigars, keychains, t-shirts, rhum and other regular stuff you can find anywhere! We went to the buffet often. It was very good but at supper MEN must wear long shorts and t-shirts polos (my husband got refused once b/c of his attire!!!) Overall we had a great time, we really relaxed, we didn't really go to the bars at night but there was alot of people! Everyone is very polite. Everyone says Holla and the front desk staff is very nice and curtious! All in all we had a wonderfull time. Have a great vacaction everyone!

<Content>Great Trip The hotel room was a little dingy, smelled like mold/mildew. Some of the patchwork was done shotty. The hotel staff was wonderful, so helpful. They kept the trip very entertaining! The resturants were great. Food was good, but it depended on what you chose. Orange juice was Tang. :( The beach was awesome. There was plenty to do and so much to see and take it. I don't know that I would take small children there. It didn't seem like there would be enough for them to do.

<Content>One of the best vacations ever.... I just returned from my stay ay the Majestic Colonial and dont know where to begin. Everything at this resort surpassed my expectations. The resort itself is spotless and pristine, the staff is incredibly friendly and will do anything to make your stay perfect. The beach and pool are like a postcard - breathtaking! The food was great and fresh - nothing pre-packaged here! The highlight of the week was our beach concierge, Denny. He was one of the nicest people we met there and his service was exceptional. He always brought our drinks with a big smile and I really enjoyed getting to know him. I highly recommend this resort to anyone who wants to enjoy their vacation with no stress!

<Author>AhWell...
<Content>Amazing! We stayed here from the 11th Sept to 25th Sept on our honeymoon. We flew with Thomas Cook airlines from Manchester, flight was excellent and transfer from airport went fine. Arrived at the Majestic about 5.30pm, greeted with cold towels  the Majestic special drink. We were checked in really quickly and brought to our room. We were in 3343, which was in a great spot, near the beach but also opposite the beach restaurant and pool, our view was fantastic, both the beach and the pool area. There was a bottle of champagne and fruit plate for us on arrival which was a nice touch. The rooms are lovely, decorated really nice with a huge four poster bed. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. The maid service was great, our maid came every day and kept the room spotless, we used to leave her a couple of dollars everyday and we were never let down. The minibar was kept well stocked everyday with beer, bottled water and soft drinks. The shower was great, it was massive you could fit 5 or 6 people in it, if you were into that sort of thing!! :) We never used the jacuzzi though. A good point about the room also is that we couldn't hear our neighbours next door, outside noises etc which was great., they seem to be well sound-proofed.The service is absolutely fantastic at the Majestic. All the staff (except for the Casino...) are friendly, helpful and cheerful. These people work so hard for a very modest salary, so if you are thinking of coming here, please tip them a few dollars, they really do deserve it. A few names we have to mention are Francesco the waiter down at the beach restaurant who also worked there at night-time in the steakhouse, Poppy and Juan the barmen in the piano ground floor bar, Laura the Guest Services Manager and Hanison who works in the burger bar beside the disco bar. They were always willing to go the extra mile and were so lovely, thanks guys! The entertainment staff were absolutely brilliant, they were up from early morning to well into the wee hours trying to keep all of us amused, well done guys and keep doing that mad Taki Taki dance! Also, go see the shows in the evening if you can, they are on at about ten o'clock in the theatre, the Michael Jackson one in particular is excellent. The pool is really spectacular, the best I've ever seen. It's huge, it basically runs from one end of the resort to the other, with loads of sun-loungers and umbrellas, there was never any hassle trying to get a space at the pool. The beach is stunning, white sand, crystal clear blue water and loads of palm trees, it really was heaven. The resort itself is gorgeous, they never seemed to stop cleaning, maintaining the gardens, sweeping, it really is a credit to the staff on how well kept the hotel is.With regard to the food we found it to be very good. Granted, after 2 weeks it gets a bit repetitive, however the food overall was fine. There was plenty of variety, our favourite restaurant was the Steakhouse, the Chateaubriand was really good. The Seafood restaurant is nice too, we had the lobster and it was delicious. We only went to the buffet twice at night-time, not too bad, Japanese was fantastic, one of the highlights, Le Gourmet was really nice as well. Don't go to Taino, we went and it was terrible, from the variety, service and the food itself it was not good. The breakfast was great, especially the omlettes and the buffet at lunch was fine. We usually drank at the beach bar before dinner, then the piano bar on the ground floor afterwards. The drink was always fine, if you didn't think there was enough alcohol in it, just ask them to add more! Also, a couple of bucks to the barman went a long way and they will look after you with some good measures :) The Casino was fairly unremarkable, it was small but the main problem is the staff who are rude and just stare at you and make no attempt to be friendly at all. The Disco bar next door is a bit hit and miss, mainly because of the music. They really could do with adding a bit more variety, we saw people walk in and walk straight back out because they were playing dodgy meringue or rap music in Spanish. At the end of the day there is all nationalities staying here and it's not really fair playing 90% music in one language. We also went to a nightclub twice called Mangu which is in downtown Bavaro, good craic, 8 dollars in - it just breaks the monotony a bit to get out of the hotel the odd night.Anyway, I have rambled on enough here, but in closing I would definitely stay here again. We met some lovely people who were here on holidays too, namely Gappy  Lorraine, John  Ava, Les  Jean, Tori  Luke, Steve  Melanie and Jimmy  Letha. I'm probably leaving out loads of others, but we truly had a great holiday and I am so depressed being back home. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is considering booking it, I looked up reviews of the Majestic prior to booking it and I was honestly not let down at all, they really do deserve to be 5 out of 5. Taki Taki!!!

<Content>Shame we didn't get a 5 rating experience!! We have just returned from the Majestic Punta Cana but after reading all the 5 star reviews I am sad to say that we must have been unlucky and missed what they experienced. Don't get me wrong it was a really nice place and we had a great holiday but unfortunately there were a few things that let it down.First of all on arrival we booked in and were told that they did not have any information booklets in English and had to make do with French? Great. Might as well have been in Klingon for all the sense that made!! Only a small thing I agree and we did manage to get one in English later in the week but by that time we had found out most things ourselves anyway.The room was fantastic with jacuzzi, huge comfy bed, tv and mini-bar etc. However, be warned!!!! I would seriously advise people that if they are allocated room 3144 that they decline and ask for another. That is unless you are an early bird who likes to get up at the crack of dawn to see sun-rises etc. Now me, I have to suffer being woken up really early by an alarm for work everyday so when I go on holiday I want to be able to lie in if I wish and wake up naturally feeling refreshed and ready for the day. But what did room 3144 give us? It is positioned right next to some sort of store room or cleaners room so EVERY day at around 7am we would be woken by the sounds of banging and cleaners shouting and screaming to each other right outside our room and it would continue for almost an hour. Talk about stressful. Despite a visit to reception where we were told there was nothing they could do and despite going out to politely ask them to be quieter it still happened every single day!!!!! We'd then get back to sleep to then be woken up at 9am by the mini-bar guy banging on the door and if you didn't let him in you didn't get your mini-bar filled at all that day. It was such a shame as all that noise really could have ruined a great holiday.The staff at the dive centre are great. The diving is not the best in the World but the enthusiasm of the staff makes up for that especially Bernardo who will admit himself he is the best diver in the World!One rather important thing to mention is the mini-market. Do not forget anything as you will need to take out a second mortgage to buy anything from there. A bag of crisps was $8 and for a small deodorant they tried to charge $47!!!!! Don't forget a mosquito plug in like we did or you'll be a very tasty meal!I would certainly reccommend this hotel. It was well worth going although it was more like a one week holiday repeated rather than a two week holiday as all the entertainment and shows the second week were exactly the same as the first week. Just a shame about the cleaning staff.

<Content>Majestic Memories We flew Sun Wing Vacations from Toronto to Punta Cana 鈥?Sept 15 鈥?22nd. Flight down was uneventful and airport  shuttle bus service was trouble free  efficient. We arrived at the Majestic about 12 noon to be greeted with our wet towels  majestic drink along with a quick check in. Our room, 2345 was ready  waiting for us and Guest Relations Manager, Laura personally showed us around the resort  to our room. Emily  Laura made themselves available for any questions or concerns we had. Thanks to you both.Good Points:Accommodations are absolutely beautiful. Our view was tremendous of the pool  ocean. We had no issues with musty smells. Maid service was perfect, with our maid coming as we asked her, about 10 am every day, once we had finished breakfast  were on our way to the pool or beach. Most every day our fridge was stocked with what we asked for. The bed was comfortable and we asked for 6 pillows on arrival and had them within an hour! The shower  hot tub were both wonderful and the toilet was not an issue, knowing what to expect prior to arrival like we did. The rooms are extremely sound proof. You never hear any outside noise, doors closing, your neighbors etc.Service is wonderful at the Majestic. Everyone is friendly, smiling and willing to help. Language was not an issue. We were 鈥榮urprised鈥?the first few nights with Champagne  cheese/crackers, sushi  white wine along with Red Wine  chocolates. We received courteous  friendly service at all the restaurants. Our wine or water glasses were never empty and someone was always coming by seeing if we needed anything. Special thanks to our Pasta  Pizza Amigos we made at the Main Buffet. Both these gentlemen are great cooks! The entertainment staff work hard and keep things 鈥榟opping鈥?around the pool  the resort. Pool  Beach are both second to none. Lounge chairs were always available as were palapas. Ocean is a beautiful aqua blue and is a comfortable temperature. The pool was always clean  also very refreshing. Restaurants / Food 鈥?We found all our meals to be very good quality. There was plenty of variety for the most part at every meal. Keep in mind there is only so many choices any restaurant/buffet can have for breakfasts etc., so some may think it gets 鈥榬epetitive鈥?after a while, but there is still lots of choices! We ate at the following restaurants; The Gourmet, The Japanese, Steakhouse(twice), Seafood along with the Main Buffet. We tried on 2 occasions to go to the Chinese Restaurant, only to find it closed, which I mention below in the improvements. It is hard to pick a favorite, as we enjoyed all the restaurants, both for the food and service we received. Bars; Lobby bar had great service and had the top shelf liquor. The only thing you were asked for, was your room #, when you ordered a premium selection. This was only for them to 鈥榯rack鈥?what was being ordered and served. There was no charges for any of these premium drinks, be it Kahula or other Top Shelf Liquors. There was no noise issues with the construction that was going on next door.Improvements:There were no 鈥淢ajestic Passport Books鈥?available. When we asked for ours at check 鈥?in, we were told it was only available in German. This provides the guests with information on restaurant times and other valuable information. Due to occupancy, all restaurants were not open every night. This is one area that they could improve the communications on to their guests. On 2 of the 7 evenings, the Buffet was the ONLY CHOICE! On a couple of occasions we arrived at the restaurant we had hoped to dine at, only to find it was closed! Last September (06) at Ocean Sands/Blue, each morning at the Main Buffet, we were given a 1 page information sheet on Daily Activities ( Times, Locations etc. for Entertainment Staff Activities ) as well as restaurants that were 鈥榠n recess鈥? This information sheet was simple but an effective way to let all guests know both what was going on that day and which restaurants they could not dine at that evening. It is understandable that resorts can not keep all the restaurants open each evening during 鈥榙own season鈥? but all the guests ask is they be told in advance which are open which nights, so they can plan their meals to include the restaurants they want to go to. Also, there should be at worst only 1 evening a week, where your only choice is a buffet style meal. That is part of the reason you choose a resort with 5-7 a la carte restaurants, so you can go to them! We took a 1-2 hour trip to Domenico Cigar Factory. We prearranged the trip via email with Heike Niesler (she is the assistant manager). They picked us up in a small van at the Majestic at 9:30 am and we were back at the hotel by 10:45 am. No charge for the trip both ways  promptly picked up when promised! It was a very interesting personal tour and provided the opportunity to both try and buy their finished products afterwards. You must pre-book a time as it is 1 on 1 service  tour. http://www.domenicocigars.com. It is well worth the time if you are interested in Cigars. In closing, find a nice way to communicate with your maid as to 鈥榳hat time works best for you to have your room cleaned鈥?and they will be more then willing to try their best to accommodate your requests. We had our room cleaned the same time 6 days straight. If you want 鈥? towels鈥?or other items, leave a note and a tip and they will gladly accommodate your requests.In the Main Buffet, if you have a special request for pizza toppings, ask and they again will do their best to make it for you. I asked and received a great pizza made within 5 minutes, hot  fresh. Be sure to tip these employees who work hard to make your stay memorable. A few dollars goes a long way and they truly appreciate it.We would definitely return to the Majestic Colonial and would highly recommend this resort to any of the Trip Adviser members.

<Content>The pool was the highlight! My hubby and I just returned from a 1 week stay at the Majestic. We travelled with Sunwing Vacations out of Toronto. Overall, we had a great time. This is most definately a RELAXING vacation, which I found to be a bit difficult to do at times. This was our 1st all inclusive vacation as we usually go on cruises (Royal Caribbean). Due to the fact that we are experienced cruisers, an all inclusive vacation had alot to live up to. The Majestic did not disappoint in most areas. The regular junior suites are amazing. I did ask before hand to have a room in building #2 overlooking the pool. After arriving we were put in building #3. I asked to switch rooms and they did give me a bit of a hard time saying I did have a pool view. But building #2 is so much closer to the pool they eventually switched us. One thing you must ask for when checking in is a Majestic Passport. I can't understand why they don't just hand these out to visitors. Otherwise you have no way of knowing what the restaurant hours are, rules about the towels, housekeeping number to call, etc. There is absolutely no information in your room about anything to do with the resort. That was a bid frustrating, but luckily we had the passport. Now for the food. This is mostly where the Majestic loses 1 star. The food doesn't even compare to cruise food. If you haven't cruised before, then you'd probably think the food was pretty good. The Supreme buffet is pretty good for breakfast, but many items are cold. I always got my eggs or omleets prepared by the cook to ensure they were fresh. The crepes were my favourite part of breakfast. Lunch at the Beach buffet was OK. Not alot to choose from. We would have done better to eat at the Supreme buffet but we were always wet from the ocean/pool. For dinner we tried the Japaneese, Le Gourmet, Rodeo Steakhouse and main buffet. The Japaneese wasn't as fun as I was hoping for. Perhaps our table was a bit on the boring side, but the cook didn't even ineract with us. Le Gourmet was good. It was nice to finally eat at a restaurant that wasn't buffet. I probably enjoyed the main buffet the best just for the variety. I found at all places they tend to cook with ALOT of oils and salt. There is no way I could stay beyond 1 week at the Majestic as the food choices were getting quite boring and routine after a few days. We never got sick thank goodness. The resort grounds are beautiful. No complaints there. We visited the Bahia Principe next door and were VERY glad we chose the Majestic as their layout is much more preferred. The pool is incredible and the ocean was fantastic. The resort couldn't have been more than 50% full so there was always a shady spot to sit. The entertainment crew did a great job. They had so much energy! We saw all the shows at 10 pm and they were good. Perhaps a bit long. Due to the comfy chairs I usually fell asleep.We did 1 exchursion. The Marinium tour where you snorkel with sharks/stingrays. That was pretty fun. The sharks were much bigger than I was expecting. If we were to go back to the Dominican I think we would stay there agin. I can't imagine a more beautiful resort or more helpful staff. The food is just part of the deal and it has to be expected to be a bit lower quality compared to cruise ships.

<Content>highly recommended!! Stayed Sept 9-15th with my husband and traveled with another couple. LOVED IT! I was so excited about this trip after reading the reviews how everyone raves about it, I was half expecting to be disappointed because everyone talked it up so much I thought How could any place be that good? Well... it is THAT good and more. The food is out of this world and there is too much i am still afraid to step on the scale. The tips we got from trip advisor all came in handy:1. bring your own insulated cup for drinks at the bar (the frozen drinks melt before they get to your mouth in their plastic cups from the hotel)2. bring a floatie/raft for the pool. Cheap one you can just leave there when you leave.3. bring lots of sunscreen and insect repellant (the mosquitos bite at night)4. I didn't need any stomach remedies but some people react differently so it is always good to have on hand.5. If you are there the night of the beach party, make sure you participate in the activities - this was the best night of our trip!6. Chateaubriand from the steak house is a MUST!!7. Send an email to the hotel a week before your trip confirming your reservation and reiterating that you would like a room upgrade if available. I did this, they never replied, but when we got there we ended up with an ocean FRONT room that was amazing. Building 2 is a good bet.8. Taxi ride was $35 and well worth not having to wait on a bus transfer or go to different hotels or arrive at hotel and airpot with a HUGE crowd, ie HUGE lines.9. SPA - I did a message at the spa. It was nice. A bit pricey for the level of service but nothing to complain about.10. SO CLEAN - everything about the Majestic is... Majestically taken care of and neat. Everyday some worker was in the pool meticulously scrubbing the tiles. With a pool that large once he would ever finish it would be time to start at the beginning again!HAVE FUN!!

<Content>Brilliant Holiday !! My husband  i stayed at he majestic aug 28th - sept 11th.When we arrived at the hotel check in was really easy  we were given the majestic drink  cool towel.I'd pm'd Emily before the trip  requested a room high up in block 2 close to the beach which we were given thanks emily ! - room 2345. It had a great view of the pool/swim up bar and you could partially see the ocean to the left.The room was lovely, we loved the jacuzzi and enjoyed our champagne which was in room on arrival.The staff were very friendly  helpful, as were the animation team.The only thing i found was the ironing board was difficult to use it wasn't a full size one and was just a small table top sort of one i ended up ironing my clothes on the bed as the cord wasnt long enough  the ironing board really small and kept collapsing !!!,wasnt a problen tho as i just used the bed !!We had a lovely king size four poster bed which we found comfortable.In the first week i got bit quite a few times but not as much the 2nd week we had spray as well  a plug in repellant next to the bed.Another thing we saw one night after leaving the sports bar was the biggest spider i have ever seen it looked like a tarantular (sp)it was lucky id had a drink or i think i would have passed out !! just sitting there on the path i thought it was a toy spider at first ! it wasnt though my husband took a picture of it which i didnt look at till i got home as i would have been paniking the rest of the holiday ! ( i am petrefied of spiders ) !!! that was the only insect (if u can call it that more like a monster) !! that we saw at the hotel except for a few lizards and a crab one night which must have strolled in off the beach which was quite funny !!!Anyway, we tried all of the restaurants and liked them all ! our favourites were the steakhouse and the dominican and the fish.We also tried the japanise  watched the cooking show which was excellent  the food was lovely.We only tried the buffet on a dinner time which had loads of choice , the pizza was delicious, the breakfast was really nice too tons of choice.The beach was beautiful  the pool was great we mainly sunbathed at the pool. We had excellent weather everday , rained early one morning for a short while then was sunny again.The outside bar on an evening woud have music/bands on  was a nice place to have a drink on an evening, we watched a few shows, the michael jackson was the best .it got quite hot in the theatre though !!The also had the sax player on the beach some nights which was nice to sit  watch.We tried a lot of different drinks our favourites were the Majestics which we liked with vodka !!, Cipriani, mudslides, and the strawberry daquari!!We did the monster truck trip  saona island which we thought were great.Neither of us wanted to come home  wished we were there for 3 weeks instead of 2 !!The Hotel is beautiful  would recommend it to anyoneim gutted to be back home  back at work we loved the Majestic  Punta Cana and are thinking of going back next yearits one of the best holidays we have had !!thank you to everyone for making our stay so enjoyable!hope to be back next year !

<Content>Paradise Found! We just returned from a 7-day stay. It was truly one of the best vacations we ever had. The hotel, the island, the beach and the service was excellent! It's best to stay closer to the lobby end of the hotel. Closer to the beach would put you next to the swim up bar and lots of afternoon activity. All the food is good, although you will find it hard to stay on any kind of diet. The Japanese reservations are worthwhile. We were less impressed with the French experience. Say hi to Jenny, the hostess in the large buffet area for breakfast. We plan to return next year.

<Content>Great place to get away from it all! My wife and I went to Majestic to celebrate our honeymoon and it was a fantastic trip. When we first arrived to the resort, we were offered warm towels to wash our faces as well as drinks. There was no problem checking in and we were inside our room in less than 15 minutes. My wife and I stayed in one of the bigger rooms facing the pool and with a jacuzzi both outside and inside. Everything was clean and fresh and very bright. We had a simple routine: breakfast, beach, lunch, pool, dinner, show. However, there were many activities you can participate in such as aerobic exercies, spanish lessons, dance lessons, games, etc. at both the beach and the pool. It looks like they do the same activities at the same time each day. Each night there is a show in an open (roofed) theater and it seemed that they got better each day we were there. The club is so-so only because there weren't too many people there. You can also play tennis there and the gym is alright.Part of the package includes free rentals of snorkeling equipment, catamaran, boogie boards. There are other services that you pay for and it seems relatively reasonable. My wife and I did parasailing the last day and it was great ($80 for both of us). We wanted to take a tour of Santo Domingo but that trip was pretty long and we had a limited amount of time.We are both strict vegetarians (no meat, chicken, fish, eggs) and we were worried that we would not be able to eat so much. However, we talked to the different chefs and they were able to create many items for us to eat. In fact, every morning we were able to eat fresh pancakes because the chef made batter just for us without eggs. We did not eat in the french restaurant, and the mexican restaurant looked like it just picked things from the buffet. The japanese place was good because there was a lot of nonfish sushi and they made a special dish for us. The last night, we had the romantic dinner at the beach. Again, because of our diets, the chefs made an amazing dinner just for us. There is a jazz band that plays music on the beach (I guess for the steak house restaurant) but the way it is set up, it felt as if they were there just for us. Our waiter, Omar, was great and really helped make the night special. Afterwards, when we got to our room we were surprised to see that they created a bubble bath for us in the jacuzzi, sprinkled with fresh flowers. We were definitely sad to leave but it was definitely a memorable trip.A few pointers: 1. Carry cash!!! either in DR pesos or US dollars. If you use a credit card, a)it doesn't always work and b)they charge 16% sales tax. There is an ATM in the check-in area and the cashier can exchange some of your money into pesos. 2. I don't know if this affected other people, but my wife and i were attacked by many, many mosquitoes. Carry repellent.3. Try not to forget your toiletries. There is a store on the property but they charge high prices for standard things.4. They are pretty strict about the food timings. When you get there, ask about the timings so that you are not late. 5. Talk to the chefs and waiters. We made friends with alot of the employees there and they would give us advice and ideas of things to do. They loved talking to us.6. Tip the workers. They work so hard and really try to make your trip pleasant. I don't think they expect anything but when you do so, they remember and will help you out more.7. Try to wake up early one morning and go to the beach. It is such a beautiful and peaceful experience. The nights gets very windy closer to the beach.The only drawback I saw was that to do souvenir shopping you have to somehow get out of the resort area. There isn't much other than what you find in the stores on the property and they are pretty expensive. There aren't any snack machines available so if you get the munchies you can buy some from the general store but again it is expensive.It is a great place to go to and unwind. Weather is great and the atmosphere is awesome. I highly recommend it.

<Content>Spectacular Majestic Colonial! Two weeks spent at the Majestic was the best holiday I have ever had. The hotel was wonderful, from start to finish. On arrival we were greeted by colonial-dressed bell-boys with hot towels (very refreshing after the 9 hour flight on a small cramped plane - upgrade to 1st class if you can!). Upon checking in we were given a comlimentary cocktail and a brochure/map of the hotel complex. This map came in very useful given the size of the complex. Unfortunately, they didn't provide a brochure in English, they only had French - but we managed. Accomodation: The rooms are luxurious to say the least. The air conditioning is a god-send and is a must 24 hours a day if you want to keep the mosquitos at bay. We had a room along the side of the hotel, but still had a fantastic sea view, including a ship wreck and coconut plantation. The mini bar was re-stocked daily, although unfortunately did not contain any snacks. It consisted of 2 waters, 2 beers and 4 soft drinks - plenty for each day. The bathroom was lovely, and although not hugely private, it was more than adequate. The housekeeping service was second to none - beds were made daily, towels and dressing gowns changed, and on the one occassion when we were missing some bed linen it took 1 minute from requestin it to having the maid at our door! Fantastic. Careful if using the telephone in the room. We bought phonecards, which are much like mobile phone top-up cards. They take off a $1/2 connection fee. However upon checking out on our last day, the hotel presented us with an extra connection fee bill which came to $20 (for approx. 9 phonecalls to the UK).Food: The food provided at the hotel was amazing. There is enough choice and variety for everybody and it doesn't get boring as there is enough that you can change what you eat every night. Breakfast is wonderful - my favourite meal of the day. The steak house was so good we went there 5 times in 2 weeks. The Chateaubriand I can highly recommend! The Japenese restaurant is out of this world. If you do one thing on your first day - make a reservation for the Japenese restaurant (or, make 2!) and take a camera when you go there! Although we missed out on the French restaurant as we forgot to reserve, friends of ours went twice and couldn't rate it highly enough! I can honestly say that we didn't have 1 complaint about any of the food! The only thing I would recommend is that if you enjoy a snack between meals (as I do) ensure that you take some crisps/biscuits/nuts with you as the mini-market in the complex is extortionate! We paid $40 for a large bag of crisps, 2 chocolate bars and some nuts! Pool:The swimming pool is without doubt the most wonderful pool I have ever been in. It is so big I couldn't believe it! Ensure you get down early to get sunbeds though, and pick your spot carefully as the pool entertainment might not be to your taste - we found it dreadful and therefore picked sunbeds at the opposite end of the pool. Beach:Like something out of a movie - white sands, clear water..just fantastic. Trips:We only took one trip - The Dominican Discovery Mega Truck. This was amazing. A long day, but really good. Take swimming clothes, a towel, wear trainers or something (as horse riding in flip-flops is not easy!). Also, part of the trip stops at a Cathedral and I wasn't allowed in as I was wearing short-shorts, so bare this in mind if you want to go in. I would recommend taking water with you. If you plan to do this trip, take some things from home with you to give to the children at the school. We were unprepared and only had our hotel shampoo etc, but many people had pens, notepads, little tennis balls, etc etc - anything cheap and cheerful that young children could play with would be great. I gave them some costume jewellery and unwanted sunglasses etc. I would recommend doing a few trips if you are there for 2 weeks as cabin fever began to set in half way through the holiday and it was great to get out of the complex for a day. Ensure when you go to the Dominican Republic that you have plenty of 1 dollar bills for tipping. It is hard to obtain change and tipping is essential when you are there. We were a little confused at first with regards who to tip, but we found that it really is up to you. We tended to tip $5 after a meal. For drinks we tipped if at the bar all night (maybe $2-5 at the end of the night) and if being served at the table we tended to tip a dollar for each round. It does follow that the more you tip, the better the service! Ensure you take lots of sun cream, lots of insect repellent and lots of stomach remedies! I suffered with a very upset stomach for 24 hours (cause unknown) and was very grateful I had taken remedies with me! Also be aware that european electrical items such as phone chargers and hair straighteners do not work. The room provides a hair dryer. All in all - a wondeful holiday. I would go back time and time again. The pictures are 100% accurate and the staff are very helpful. You will have a great time here!

<Content>The best vacation ever Went to the Majestic Colonial August 1 to August 7th. Had to reschedule to a death in the family but had a new trip booked by our great travel agent World Travel in 3 weeks.My wife and myself stayed in a Majestic Colonial Suite along with my teenage son and a friend next to our room.There is nothing that went wrong on this vacation.Jacuzzi in the room, on the porch right out to the pool. The food and drinks were fantastic. The hotel staff could not do enough for us. Rafael in reservations worked with us to help make our stay the best. Couldn't have stayed for another week or two. No question this is the best resort in Punta Cana.

<Content>A perfect vacation in paradise My wife and I just returned on Saturday September 8, 2007 from this amazing hotel. I want to say how wonderful the staff is and I personally want to thank Emily and Victor for making our stay at the Majestic most memorable. Upon arrival we were given cool towels and the Majestic Cocktail. Check in was a breeze and Victor escorted us personally to guest services to make reservations for the Japanese Restaurant. The food and presentation was excellent, however the maitre'de Alfredo I believe is his name is very rude and unprofessional. He needs to work on his professionalism or he should find another profession. After we made our reservation, Victor then escorted us to our room. We were upgraded to the Majestic Colonial Suite at no charge due to the fact that my wife has been recovering from a lengthy illness and I had e-mailed the hotel a few weeks before our arrival and was told they would try there best to accomodate. We were so thrilled when we arrived and they were able to accomodate our request. The room was just what the doctor ordered. We were truely treated like royalty throughout our stay and I can truely say this is the most beautiful hotel we have stayed at so far in our many trips to Punta Cana. I would not hestitate to recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a vacation to Punta Cana. Thank You again.The Corbetts

<Content>Very Pretty Resort, but got sick My husband and I stayed at the Majestic from (8/26-9/02). We arrived before the 3p.m. check in time and our room wasnt ready so they sent us down to lunch and we were still able to be in our rooms by about 2:00.The staff was very nice and worked very hard to please.Unfortunatly we got sick, my husband worse than me, so much so that I took him to the doctor on site. Instead of just giving him the antibiotics she gave him some injection that he had a bad allergic reaction too!!! So that was scary being in a foreign place and being at the mercy of a doctor who you dont fully trust!!!!! My husband responded well to the antibiotics and was only out of commission for about a day and a half. I also had bad stomach issues and broke out into hives but after the disaster with the doctor I decided to self treat.The grounds were kept very well, the pool was fantasic and the beach was clean and beautiful.The food was pretty tasty but just didnt agree with our stomachs. I loved the Japenese restaurant, but make sure you make reservations right away, we only got in because someone didnt show up. The French restuarant wasnt great to me, they did have a delicious chocolate cake dessert though.The breakfast buffet was good. I didnt care for the continental breakfast in the restuarant by the beach, the food never looked fresh and despite having an expiration date of mid september my husband got a molded yogurt and the staff at the resturant made no apologies for it.I would just advise those who havent travelled internationly to come prepared with any medicines that you think you may need particularly anti biotics and stomach medications.

<Content>Beautiful Resort My husband and I spent 6 days at the Majestic for our 10 year wedding anniversary. We had an amazing time. We were greeted at checkin with a scented cold towel to wipe our brow and hands, and then we were given a non alcoholic drink called the Majestic. We were completly hooked on this drink. We never tried it with Rum, though I hear it was very good. We found that the best bar to get the Majestic is the front lobby bar, by the checkin. After we received our drink, we were escourted by the most beautiful concierge Gabriella, to the couches to go over all of the specifics of the resort and to book any reservations for the 2 restaurants that require reservations. I highly recommend eating at the Hibachi Bar. Lewis was our cook, and he was great. Gabrielle then escourted us to our room. It was a long walk, but well worth it. We upgraded our room through cheapcarribean.com to the Colonial Jr Suite Oceanview. We were on the 3rd floor and the room was very pretty. It had a musty smell to it tough, but the view of the ocean was breath taking. Gabrielle walked us through the resort, telling us where everything was located. She made us feel so at home and leaving us wondering why we did not book our stay for longer! Here is a breakdown of my Pro's and Con's:PROS:1) The staff is amazing. They have the best customer service. If you do not speak spanish, it is OK. If you atleast show that you are trying to speak Spanish and willing to learn, the staff is very happy to teach. Some of the reviews say that the staff is rude. I can see why some may say that, if they are not sympathetic to the language difference. 2) The Pool and Beach is so amazing!!! They are both so clean and well maintained. The workers on the grounds are doing just that, working. You never see them sitting down. 3)The Michael Jackson show, is a must see. We enjoyed it very much.CONS:1) The food is aweful!! Stay clear of the buffet closest to the beach and pool. I think they serve yesterday'a leftovers. The French Restaurant (this requires reservations) is gross. I couldn't even tell you what I had. It said chicken, but it did not taste like chicken. I was worried that I would gain weight while on vacation, but I actually lost weight. Snacks were never around. If you are a drinker and like alcohol, you will not have a problem, getting the drinks you want.2) The room was beautiful, but the room had a musty smell that came home in our suitcases. 3) The person who refilled the fridge in the room, seemed to miss our room 2 days in a row, so we had to make sure and get bottled water from the bar before going to our room at night.4) We did the Bavero Splash snorkeling excursion. It was alot of fun and the guide was awesome, but the actual snorkel time was about 30 min. We spent more time getting everyone on their 2 person speed boat, than anything. So if you are looking for snorkeling, do not take this excursion. This excursion is fun if you want to do a little snokeling and a little speed boat driving. We meet a really nice couple from the states and had dinner with them one night and meet a few more Americans the last night we were there. There were not a lot of Americans there, but that really did not bother us. It was neat to see all of the different nationalities in one place. Oh I almost forgot, we paid the extra $150 for the romantic dinner on the beach. The food was not any better, but the server treated us like royality and the atmosphere of it all was spectacular. I highly recommend it for any special occasion. I would recommended having it on the beach, and not the Gazebo in the middle of the resort. Yes, it is in the middle of all of the nightlife and is not very romantic with all of the loud music and people walking around.We very much enjoyed ourselves and the pool, beach and customer service out weighed the terrible food. We were sad to leave and next year we will take our daughter and stay longer than 6 days. The pictures that you see on the web do not do this resort justice. It is much prettier in person. I just hope that the cooks can take culinary class and upscale the taste of the food. There is a ala carte side to the Hibaci Bar that you do not need reservations for. That I would say was the best meal, and so was the buffet at the front of the resort. We ate most of our meals there.

<Content>Great Time From the onset, the architecture captured our attention upon our arrival. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful! The food ranged from Mediterranean to American- a testimony to the resort's visitors; the quality was quite good. Another spectacular feature of Majestic was the sprawling and meandering pool. (No one could complain of the pool being too small!)Majestic Colonial was a great vacation experience for my wife, eight year old son and me. I would recommend it to families, couples and singles. Few guests complained about the openness of the bathroom, but it was a situation that did not adversely affect the accommodations. A special mention needs to made to the Animation team who provided entertainment of interactive games and shows - Miguel, Andres, Lina, Alexandra, Pablo, Kelly, Julio and Tyson shone throughout and were approachable and friendly. They did an incredible job!

<Content>Not What I was Expecting AT ALL THIS WAS MY FIRST AND LAST TRIP TO PUNTA CANA AND THE MAJESTIC HOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Before my fianc茅e and i decided on this hotel we read many reviews that stated that this was the best hotel in the DR and that it was a 5 star hotel. All i can say is that if this is a 5 Star in the Dominican Republic i am scared to go to anything less in this country. My fianc茅e and I are pretty well traveled and we have stayed in everything from trucker stops along the I-95 to 5 star hotels in the Turks and Caicos and 2 stars in the Bahamas so I would like to think that we have a pretty good idea as to what to expect from a hotel that claims itself to be a 5 star. As a couple that spends most of our vacation time in Motels and Howard Johnsons and the odd Marriott and doing local trips to save money, we splurge a little on a vacation about once every 2 years and pamper ourselves so we know what we are expecting from a 5 star hotel, and the Majestic is definitely NOT THAT!!!! To make it easier I am going to break this into different sections as there is allot to tell.Appearance:I will give the hotel the just respect it deserves as allot of energy was put into maintaining the grounds and the appearance of the hotel by the management and the staff. The grounds were very scenic with a great beach and a nice pool, even though it was all about 4ft deep with no deeper sections.The AirportFrom the moment we arrived in the DR it felt like we were getting hustled!!!! When you land be prepared to pay $20 per person just to enter the country. After collecting our bags and clearing customs we had to fight our way through the hoards of aggressive taxi drivers and bus boys and baggage handlers that were adamant on taking your bags and convincing you that taking a taxi was the better way. Check inWe finally got to the hotel at about 2pm after arriving at 11:30am, as predicted from other reviews our room was not ready. We waited around until about 4:30 before getting a little edgy as we were still in our Jeans and Socks (Travel Cloths) and were quite hot and bothered after sweating, so we asked to be let into our room just so that we could change into cooler outfits. After being reluctantly being allowed into a room to get changed and securing our passports at about 5PM!!!!! we made our way to the Bar and started to finally start our holiday.The RoomA little later when we decided to get changed to go to dinner we returned to a finally finished room that looked lovely, with a hudge bath and a luxurious King Sized 4 poster bed. I decided to jump belly first into the bed out of excitement AND ALMOST BROKE MY ARM (No exaggeration, my arm still hurts and that happened 6 days ago). I have NEVER FELT A BED SO HARD IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND I WAS IN THE NAVY FOR 6 YEARS!!!! the mattress was about 3 inches thick and coated in some kind of vinyl (5 Star hotels generally have nice beds) the pillows were made of foam and the sheets were like sand paper on our freshly sunned skin. I have never slept so badly in my life!!!! The Rooms on the bottom floors had their Jacuzzis outside, who is going to take a bath with everyone watching?!?! I didn鈥檛 see anyone using them the whole time we were thereRoom ServiceI advise that anyone that goes here to lock up EVERYTHING!!!! One evening my fianc茅e went to put on her deodorant and when she opened the top there was a big black hair on it and she gets her armpits waxed!! 陆 of her lotion was used and her shoes tried on!! All of this from a hotel that claims themselves to be 5 star. After reporting this to a manager on our second day the maids gave us terrible service!!! We had to actively ask for fresh towels and even get fresh toilet roll after having food poisoning.FoodI myself am from a Caribbean country and I come to expect the culinary quirks that the region offers, from over seasoned meats, to orange juice drink instead of orange juice, but both my fianc茅e and I got food poisoning on our third day from the Japanese restaurant and were sick for the remainder of the vacation!! The buffet meals were ok, but there was little to No variation in the selection that they offered, and by the second day we were pretty much eating the same thing over and over and over!! On another of the nights we ventured to the steak house where we got an ok steak with rotten vegetables, yes Rotten. We could see where the cauliflower heads had been shaved to cut the mold off. MarketIf you see a market in the hotel by the stage area, avoid it like the Clapp, we saw it and thought that it was a cute idea, but the people at the stalls were very very very very aggressive and they swarmed you like a hoard, all of them telling you their pity stories and grabbing your arm to drag you to their stall鈥? Even though they all were selling the same low quality stuff.. Well I am not going to go on, but all I can say is watch your change, take Imodium with you, put all of your stuff in the safe and DON鈥橳 GO UNLESS ITS YOUR ONLY OPTION.

<Content>loved the pool side entertainment The group of pool side entertainers were excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed their daily activities! The group consisted of Rey, Andres, Sandy, Nelson, Samuel, Pablo, Lucy, Alexandra, Milly, Tyson, and Jesus. The bartender Densia was also excellent!! My husband and I were there with two other couples and we would definitely go back. The resort was awesome!

<Content>Perfect for Families with Small Kids! Grannie, the kids and I ventured to the Majestic Colonial this year and it was fabulous. Things we loved: the beach stretches endlessly and is safe. There are no barriers between hotels so you can walk for miles undeterred and reach great expanses of white sand where few visitors pass within minutes of leaving the property. It was heaven. And the water was glorious. Somehow I managed to get glass in my foot on the beach but I'm sure that can happen anywhere! The pool snakes through the property so there was somewhere new to rest our bones every day. There were always enough chairs and the kids loved swimming up to the bar for frozen, non-alcoholic drinks. Compared with previous resorts, the food was much better than expected (and significantly better than Club Med) and the portions in the sit down restaurants were much too large. The unconfirmed rumor is that the GM is a CIA-trained chef and well versed in restaurant management. Even if it鈥檚 not true, it鈥檚 certainly believable. (Side note to the self-proclaimed food snobs: If you鈥檙e that concerned about culinary delights, why are you even staying in an all-inclusive resort? Common sense would dictate that you belong at the Ritz-Carlton 鈥?not eating cheeseburgers poolside with the hoi poloi.) With that said, the steak and seafood restaurant by the beach was delicious, the Japanese food was excellent (and the experience was fun for the kids), and the Dominican restaurant was a nice surprise (not sure why it was empty each night). On the last day, I visited the spa for a massage and mani/pedi 鈥?and was bummed that I hadn鈥檛 taken advantage of their services earlier in the week. It is a nice facility with a beautiful outdoor courtyard. The only minor issue is that they positioned the building right next to the pool where the water aerobics and activities take place so it鈥檚 not as serene as it could be. Speaking of which, there is a beautiful, small chapel on the site where a Roman Catholic mass was held on Sunday. The chapel itself is really sweet; the priest, on the other hand, was extremely underwhelming (to put it politely). I think I would have gleaned more from his sermon if they didn鈥檛 have someone translating it into English and I could have made up something of my own . . . The Kids鈥?Club was nothing to write home about. Understaffed with no planned activities. Two shabby slides and a tiny pool. But the kids loved the video games, per usual, and my mom and I loved one of the women working there. She was extremely friendly and fun loving. Another outdoor game room was situated across the way which had a giant chess set that the kids enjoyed playing. The foosball and ping pong tables were rundown and in need of repair. There is a large outdoor room with big, cushioned seats that shows movies every night which we took advantage of more than once. Chicken Little en Espanol for the kids and cocktails for us! The shows, on the other hand, started much too late for families with small children. The vendors from the market outside the property come in once/week to sell their goods at similar prices so there is no real need to leave the premises if you do not want to. They barter with you and have typical tourist goods but it鈥檚 fun for an afternoon. The rooms were clean and spacious; the Jacuzzi tub, for whatever reason, is in the middle of the room without walls around it. Good thing I鈥檓 not modest. The tile floors in the room, however, are slippery when wet. We entered the room apparently after the maid had left and my youngest (who is five) slipped on the floor and cracked his chin open. We had to carry him to the on-site doctor and get stitches. Not a pleasant experience at all but we survived. And, aside from playing the same soundtrack for a week (if I never hear 鈥淗otel California鈥?again, I鈥檒l be thrilled), the lobby is efficiently run. We checked in and out easily with very few people in line at any one time. Travel time from the airport was short 鈥?and we were in a tour bus. Very doable trip. The travel home, as is expected with customs and airport security at these small islands, takes much too long with little children. This is probably the biggest deterrent for our return. Overall, this was, by far, the best property we鈥檝e visited in the past four years.

<Content>First AI Experience, loved the Majestic! Stayed that the Majestic from 15-23 August 2007 with 2 friends and had a great vacation. Hotel: Beautiful resort and spotlessly clean. The resort is big but not overwhelming. We stayed halfway between the beach and the main building (room 3327) and it was a short walk everywhere. The only time it ever seemed crowded was in the evenings for the shows. Clientele: seemed to be mainly Canadians, Americans, and Spanish...with a few Italian, French, and Eastern Europeans guests. Room: large and comfortable. Beds are firm which is good for my back but one of my friends didn't like it so much. The pillows are really flat. Like everyone comments, the bathrooms are oddly designed; the shower could fit a group of 5 but the adjacent stall with the toilet barley allows you to spread your legs when seated (sorry for the mental picture..lol) The lack of privacy in the bathroom is a bit uncomfortable at first but after a couple of days it doesn't seem to be a big deal anymore. Pool: big, clean, great swim-up bear. Not very deep but great for hanging out with a frozen cocktail. No problem getting lounge chairs but people do play the annoying game of getting up at the crack of dawn to put down towels to reserve chairs for later in the day. If you don't want the stress of that, you may not get the spot of your choice but rest assured, you'll still find a place. Beach: again big, clean and plenty of chairs. If you want one of the chairs closest to the water and with some shade, you'll have to get up early and claim your territory (see pool comments). But if you don't care about being a few rows back from the water, or don't care about having the shade..you can arrive when you want. The water was very clear and with a nice sandy bottom. Gets up bit choppy when the wind picks up in the afternoon. Yes some women go topless: get over it and grow up, it's no big deal; your children will not be scared for life. Food: had no problem with the food at all. I ate and drank what I wanted and never got sick. Brushed my teeth with the tap water but other than that stuck with bottled (the ice and the water they serve in pictures at the restaurants is purified so no problems there). My rankings of the restaurants: Beach side grillBeach side seafood (lobster and shrimp excellent)Teppanakyi (sp?)Buffet (breakfast was great and the other meals good)Taino (good fajitas and chili con carne)Gourmet (by far the worst...all the rest I was able to find something liked but this place was really terrible)Animation Team: didn't really participate but they seemed to be keeping people entertained. They weren't pushy about trying to get you involved but made you feel welcome if you wanted to join. Went to a couple of the shows, the performers did a good job but it's just not really my thing. Casino: small but fun. Played Black Jack a couple of nights. Dealers seemed to have a lot of luck....unfortunately I didn't..lolDisco/Sports bar: went one night, was pretty crowded with mixed ages. Gym: small but had basic equipment. 1 bench press, 3 adjustable benches, free weights and a few different weight machines. Treadmill, Elliptical, etc. Went a few mornings before breakfast and it was never too crowded. There had bikes that you could sign out for free if you wanted to ride around the resort. Excursions: book your excursion through your tour operator's on site rep. Water sports can be booked at the beach shop. We booked a 2 hour snorkeling trip with the water sports shop at the beach (marimana?). The snorkeling is just ok; not a lot of variety of fish but bring some bread in a plastic water bottle and you'll be surrounded by tons of fish. The blonde German woman working at the shop is annoying with a bad attitude but other than that, the actual trip was fine. Also booked a full day excursion to Saona Island. It was nice to get off the resort but in my opinion not really worth it. Travel 2 hours by bus (stop at a tacky souvenir shop on the way) then another 2 hours by catamaran to Saona, lunch there (bad food), stay at the beach for 2 hours, then return to the bus by speedboat, stopping at a sand bar along the way. I wasn't all that impressed by Saona, the beach was full of seaweed and it really stunk. Apparently this was due to hurricane Dean but I've read similar comments in other past posts so I'm not sure that's the case. It wasn't a total washout but it's not something I would do again. Shopping: On Wed. evenings they have a marketplace at the hotel. The prices might be a bit higher than what you can bargain down to off resort but there is less pressure from the vendors. Still bargain as much as you can of course. There is a marketplace just outside of the resort. I bought a couple of paintings there but BEWARE that the vendors there will try to take you for as much as possible. Of course all the time telling you that since you are a friend they will give you a special price. The painting I bought (maybe 3 feet long by one foot high) started at 150 USD...I got it for 20 USD. (I saw similar at the resort shop for 40- 60 USD) I'm sure it cost a fraction of that to produce. So don't just don't offer half as some other posters have recommend. Paying a mark up is fine, they have to make a living, but come on... Tipping: the staff really works very hard and does an excellent job....and most are extremely nice. You don't need to tip just for the sake of doing it but if there is staff member that you feel gave you really good service or were exceptionally nice to you, a tip at the end of your evening or end of your stay is very much appreciated. In summary: it was a great, relaxing vacation and I wouldn't hesitate to go back to the Majestic or recommend it to others.

<Content>The Majestic truly lives up to the hype!!!! I just got home a few days ago from the Majestic and I am wishing it was this time last week so I could be on my way there again! I travelled w/three friends and we did a girls weekend at the Majestic and we absolutely loved it! I had been reading review after review about the resort and it lived up to every thing I had read and more w/the exception of the food. So I thought I'd just throw my two cents in and give my perspective of the resort and all it has to offer.When you arrive they give you a cool scented cloth and a non alcoholic majestic. Let me tell you, from the first sip of the drink we were all hooked and couldn't wait to try the version w/rum! The rooms are what you see on the website pics and are very nice. When we walked in we had champagne waiting for us which was a great touch. I had read so much about the bathrooms on here but if you go prepared knowing whats in store it really isn't that bad, My roommate and I brought air freshner and if one person had to use the bathroom the other hung out on the balcony for a little while, it was totally manageable but we knew about it before we went so we were prepared. Be careful when opening your mini refrigerators, the door on ours always flew open and anything on the door would go flying including a glass beer bottle which smashed all over our floor. This did cause some frustration w/housekeeping as a language barrier prevented them from understanding we had glass on our floor that needed to be cleaned up asap and they didn't get to it until the next day but that was the only issue w/our rooms. The beach is absolutely amazing!!!! It was so clean and there were always chairs available at any time of the day. As for the pool, this has to be the best pool I've ever seen or swam in. It is so clean and in the afternoon is a blast if you are up near the swim up pool bar! I highly reccommend getting involved in the activities as they are a lot of fun and learning the taki taki dance was a blast!Now for the food, well that was the only thing I personally found lacking! Coming from someone who has been dieting for months and I let myself off during my trip, I was highly disappointed in the choices and taste of the food. The best meal I had was on my last night at that was at the Gourmet restaurant. Also, the beach restaurant during the day is not that good. We found ourselves going to the buffet for a better meal but if you plan on doing that, make sure you bring clothes to wear over your bathing suits and dry off before putting them on so that they will let you in. As for the nightlife, the discoteque is okay. One thing that threw us girls by surprise was the aggressive dancing from males from the dominican. At first we found it to be personally violating of our space but over time and from talking to others on our plane we found out that this is the way they typically dance and it was a cultural difference not what we thought. Just wanted to make you aware of this if by chance you dance w/a local. The staff and service at the Majestic was absolutely amazing. Everyone always said Hola as they passed and the staff did everything they could to please the guests from the bartenders who kept the drinks flowing (Nati is great) to the maintenance men who were more than willing to let three girls take their pool kayake and row it around the pool (okay we flipped it over too) for fun. The staff was so friendly and so service oriented, they made our stay absolutely wonderful. Last but not least, the resort, it is as gorgeous as the pictures show. You can see how much pride and hard work the staff and owners have put into creating paradise for their guests. With every view you saw beauty and we all just fell in love w/the resort from the get go! This was my first trip to Punta Cana but it definitely won't be my last! When I return I will stay at the Majestic again and will reccommend it to anyone else I know going there!

<Content>The Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana is a Great Place to Stay!! If you are visiting Punta Cana, DR, stay at the Majestic Colonial!!My friend and I just returned from the Dominican Republic where we stayed at the Majestic Colonial and we did not want to leave!! We had a fabulous vacation there! We booked the hotel online because we were impressed with the photographs and reviews only to find out that it was all so true. When we first arrived, we were greeted by several wonderful employees who warmly welcomed us and took our luggage. Before we even checked in at the front desk, another employee greeted us with wonderfully cold hand towels. What a treat. These were such lovely initial gestures and I am happy to say that the service continued at that level.The resort is situated on a beautiful stretch of white sandy beach and includes very comfortable rooms (with whirlpool baths), a chain of swimming pools, casino, gym, several restaurants, a spa, a chapel, a theater and various shops. You should definately take advantage of all these services. I especially enjoyed the spa. Before we visited, we were warned about food in the DR, however the food at the Majestic Colonial was great. There is a huge breakfast buffet each morning with made-to-order omelettes, various breakfast meats, breads, juices and fresh fruits (inlcuding some awesome papaya and other locally-grown fruits). The French and the Japanese restaurants require reservations and I recommend that you make reservations at both upon your arrival. Both are excellent. The walk-in restaurants are great also. The seafood, steak, and variety of salads were very good. Don't miss out on the Santo Domingo coffee. It was wonderfully smooth and you should purchase some to take home with you.While you are there I recommend that you plan an excusion. There are reps near the front desk that will gladly coordinate your trip. Plan a trip to Manatee Park where you will see some wonderful local plant and animal species including the giant turtles, flamingoes and cocatoos. You will also be able to swim with the dolphins!! Take some extra cash with you to purchase local art work (at reasonable prices!). We purchased many beautiful carvings made of wood and volcanic rock. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the very best part of the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana - its PEOPLE. The employees there are super nice, highly accomodating, very engaging and friendly. Its been a few years since I took Spanish, but everyone there speaks at least some English and was willing to speak Spanish slowly. When you visit say Hola to Angel Viscaino at the front desk and all the other staff there. Everyone there always has a friendly smile for you and will make your trip unbelievably fun! There is so much to do at the Majestic Colonial. You will be glad you booked you vacation there. -GailSilver Spring, MD

<Content>Awesome Week with my Family This is very difficult to write in a short paragraph. I apologize ahead of time for the novel. There is just no way to do the Reader's Digest version. My husband and I and our three children(ages 26, 24,  20) stayed at the Majestic from August 12th through the 19th. I couldn't have asked for a more wonderful vacation with my family. We love the beach and usually go to the Outer Banks of North Carolina but wanted to try something different. It was awesome!!  I had booked through Vacation Travel Mart (looked online and then called the 800 number -- sorry, I am from the old school -- I needed to talk to a human!). They have wonderful prices and Beth was so pleasant to deal with. We booked two standard suites, one with a king and the other with 2 beds. I PM'd Emily beforehand and asked if we could have connecting rooms with a pool view and SURE ENOUGH we did! We were located in 3216 and 3217 and the view was so beautiful. We couldn't see the ocean but that was okay. The little bit of time we were on our balcony the pool and gardens were gorgeous to look at. We were located halfway through the resort so it was always an easy walk to anything that we wanted to do. Our sitting area had a sofa bed that we did not use but in the kid's room that is where my son slept and found it to be very comfortable. We found the beds to be fine and the bathroom situation was not a problem even for my children. The rooms were always cleaned in a timely fashion and the refrigerators were always stocked sufficiently. (We always left tips, too). There were no issues with using our hair dryers and hair irons from home so I returned the adapters that I had purchased just in case when we got home. We had a nonstop flight from Philly which was great. We experienced no problems at the airport and quickly found our tour company, Turinter, and were immediately taken to an airconditioned van. The ride was uneventful (other than making some new friends on the van) and took about half an hour. Check in was a breeze and the welcoming cold towels and Majestic drinks were perfect. Yeci checked us in and showed us our rooms (one was ready and one was not) and then she showed us to the Buffet for lunch. She was very pleasant and spoke beautiful English. Lunch was a welcome sight after being up since 3:00 that morning to catch our plane. The food was delicious -- plenty to choose from to make anyone happy. We ate at the Buffet every morning and became very fond of Juana and we were sad to say goodbye. She was always so pleasant and welcoming and remembered how we all liked our coffee. It was a pleasure to leave her a tip every day!! We received several surprises in our rooms during our stay besides the champagne upon arrival. We had wonderful fruit and cheese and crackers, two bottles of wine, sushi, truffles, and chocolate dipped grapes and strawberries. What a nice surprise when returning to our rooms after a day at the beach!! Thank you Majestic!! I know I am going on and on but I just can't stop raving about the Majestic. It is magnificent and we all really felt special being there. We enjoyed the steak and seafood restaurants and enjoyed eating outside with the ocean breeze. There was even a meteor shower while we were there! We also loved Henry at this site and the many MamaJuanas that we drank there!! Oh boy, are they strong!! The Taino  Matsuri restaurants were very good but I think I could do without returning to Le Gourmet. It was just okay -- maybe I just don't have a very discriminating palate!? The service everywhere was wonderful and the Dominican people are just so pleasant and ready to do anything for you. We don't speak Spanish other that a word here and there but got along fine. I did bring a dictionary just in case.  The beach was beautiful. We always found chairs under a palapa no matter what time we arrived. We were armed with our Bubbas which the bartenders filled happily. The ocean was fabulous. The water was warm, calm and clear but did get a little wavier (not rough) later in the week as Dean approached but never rough enough to keep us out. Yes, there were women, young and older, topless, but you kind of get used to it after a while and you know what --they are not as hung up on body image as we Americans -- more power to them!! My husband had never had a massage so after 33 years of marriage I treated us to a couples massage at the wonderful Spa. It was 80 minutes of pure heaven and so worth the $100 each. We went to the Shows nightly. Some were better than others but still were enjoyable. My children enjoyed the disco and also enjoyed taking a swim in the pool one morning at 3:30 after being at the disco. Harmless fun! They also enjoyed the ATV tour that they took with Turinter. My son had done that tour 2 years ago and recommended that his sisters go with him. They all really liked it and they actually rode down to the point where the Atlantic meets the Caribbean.  It is pretty obvious that I would highly recommend the Majestic to all. There is something for everyone and you can make it as quiet or as busy as you like. We are already looking at our calendar to see when we can return. Thanks again to everyone on the Forum. Your advice and information is priceless. That is why we chose the Majestic and were not disappointed!!

<Content>The Majestic is Majestic The Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana is just that, Majestic!As a family of eleven (ages ranging from 16-79) traveling together, including our 79 year-old father who was given the nick-name sexy papa by the outstanding animation/entertainment staff, we had a great time from Aug3-15. This all-inclusive resort is beautiful, the staff is friendly and responsive(special thanks to Laura), there is a big variety of good food to choose from, the bars do what bars do, as does the disco and the casino. The 10 PM nightly shows were entertaining too. You can make your stay what you want by getting involved in the many activities available, or you can do nothing at all.We especially enjoyed the 4:30-6PM taki-taki party time at the pool that culminated in a daily dance lesson. I would like to give the very talented animation/entertainment team special recognition and thanks. They were very inviting and friendly to us, especially to sexy papa who loved to dance with them. So thank you to: Lucy, Angelina, Lina, Samuel, Kiko, Pablo, Miguel, Danny, and a very special thanks to the leader of the team, Sandy, who had a genuine feeling of sincerity towards sexy papa which made dad and us feel very happy.We would definitely come back here for another vacation.Son of sexy papa.

<Content>Luna Miel My husband and I stayed last week at the Majestic. We had a very chilled out and fabulous honeymoon. ( they upgraded us to partial ocean and pool view- gave us a romantic dinner for 2 and breakfast in bed since it was our luna miel)The overall feel of the resort is one of relaxation, calmness and a do what you like attitude. There is always food and drink available, so you dont feel scheduled. Since there are a bunch of different restuarants, you can eat a new one each night.(some good, some just OK) The staff work so hard- your wine glass will never go empty. We found that once we had a chat with them, they were your best friend for your stay. I didnt find that if you left a tip- you got better service. Some nights we tipped and others we didnt and the service was always friendly and efficient. I think you'll find yourself wanting to tip- as they are that good.The beach was the nicest of the resorts I saw. Majestics beach is very quiet and there is always a chair in the shade.The further you walked in the direction of Riu the noiser and more chaotic and crowded the beach got. Keep walking and you come to a market-ready with VERY eager shop owners to sell you their goods.. Have a look at all the shops before buying, that way you can get a feel for who is going to give you the best deal. The ones at the beginning of the market will try to hassle you into their shops the minute they see you. After seeing them all, you get a better sense of what's available ( the better the deals you can haggle.)The nightlife could use some improving, the casino is small and the nightclub is a bit cheesy. They are fun the first few nights, but after that they become old. However, there is a very nice ouside bar that has varying music and theme lighting. Order a Mama Juana from this bar or the casino bar.We didnt have any issues with bugs or noise or sickness.Overall we had a great time with no complaints. I would reccommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Excellent resort, beautiful beach! The hotel is beautiful and well maintained. Nice pool, this was the reason we selected this hotel, but the beach was so beautiful that we spent must of our 7 days vacation (from August 23rd to 30th) there. The restaurants are OK, the Steak House is very good. Service is great at all levels, people are very friendly. You have the option to be involved in all the animation programs or just relax (as we did).We had an issue with the mosquitoes so you better take a repelent, and by the way, a lot of sun tan loton or any other product you may need since the prices at the hotel are sky high (like in every other resort in the world).Hotel staff did everything to make our stay a nice one. The check in and out processes were fast, we recommend that the previous night to your checkout pay the extra charges (Cava, specialty wines which are not included and calls). Thanks to all the people from the Majestic!!!Just as an additional comment, immigration process, both in and out of the PUJ airport was fast and straight forward.

<Content>Very relaxing vacation We stayed at the hotel from August 25 - September 1st. The grounds are lovely and the pool is fantastic. The rooms are large but as noted by other travelers there is almost no privacy. The jacuzzi tub that is in every room is out in the open, however, there is a large, separate shower that you can use if you are looking for privacy. That being said, that is probably the only place where you can have a little privacy in the room. The toilet is the size of a pinhead and is enclosed only with a frosted glass door that doesn't really give you any privacy. Every noise and smell is free to wander throughout the room. The food is buffet food and people should not expect it to be anything more than that. The selections are somewhat redundant and oftentimes they would run out of things. The specialty restaurants have limited choices but the food is better than at the buffet. The biggest problem that we found was the lack of airconditioning. The only place that was airconditioned other than some of the specialty restaurants was your room. The lobby is open air as is the theater and there aren't even fans so the air gets hot and stagnant and somewhat uncomfortable. The staff works hard and try to please. Most people do not speak Englsih but why should they, they live in the Dominican Republic. People that expect English speakers wherever they go should stay in the US or go to England and/or Australia. The check in/out people speak some English as does the Entertainment staff who really did work hard and tried very hard to keep the activities going and the pool hopping. Some top shelf was available at every bar we went to including the swim up bar, but you had to specify that that is what you wanted. Unlike other reviewers, we found the bartenders to pour on the heavier side. Certainly didn't cheap out on the liquor when making drinks. The coffee cups was always filled, as were the water glasses, and the mini-bar in the room. Two beers per day max in the room. We had a very relaxing time and made the most of the pool. Bring your own raft as to buy one in the store on the grounds is $10 minimum. If your planning to buy rum as gifts, buy it at the markets outside of the hotel as it is considerably less money than at the hotel The duty free shops at the airport are a rip off and are more expensive than the hotel. Pack the liquor in your suitcase. You cannot carry it through. Overall, we had a very mellow relaxing time. Oh, nearly impossible to win at the casino, spend your money elsewhere.

<Content>Loved the Majestic bMy friend and I stayed at the Majestic from 8/12-8/17 and we couldn't have been more happy. The place is beautiful, the ocean and the pool just stunning!! The room was spacious and clean and the people were extremely friendly. We had no problems with the food and restaurants, and the chateaubriand at the steakhouse was incredible!! Denny, the man who gets the drinks at the beach or anything for that matter, was spectacular! He worked hard all day and was so friendly. When we arrived, they mentioned that it may be a little slow because they are more laid back. They work harder there than anyplace I have been to. In the restaurants, they never stop for a second to please you and are constantly on the move. Plenty of shopping, I was shocked with the shops and the men come on Thursday to sell lots of statues, paintings and jewelry at a great bargain. Throw a few dollars and you really get the special treatment. Just get to the towel stand by 10am, because the towels run out and you may have to wait about 15 minutes. At the beach we always had a spot and the pool is so huge and they always have things going on. You can just sit at the swim-up bar and watch the activities or meet people. Also a great mix of people. The spa is so pretty and the woman gave me an extra hydrotherapy treatment for free. I would go back there no doubt.

<Content>Enjoyed the Majestic! We just returned the Majestic Colonial and it was a very good experience for us. We have traveled etensively but only have done a few other AI's, others being in Mexico and Panama. Our booking was with BeachDetinations.com aka Solar Tours aka HotelBeds and we had absolutely no problems with any portion of the trip, The transfers between the airport and hotel were efficient, clean and airconditioned. It was a small van and we were not herded into a big bus. This meant we were fast out of the airport and arrived at our destination in record time.Check-In: It was fast and easy. We were of course greeted with a cool cloth and refreshing drink and beautiful smiles. The check in process was easy and language was absolutely no problem whatsoever. This was a good omen for us. After check-in we went to Guest Relations and make reservations for the 2 restaurants that require them. Jenny from Guest Relations was a pleasure to meet and she personally escorted us to our room and made certain we were pleased with our location. We were off to a good start. Room: We had Room #4323 and it was a great location with a expansive view of the ocean and the swaying palms in the lot next door. We had absolutely no complaints about the room. We had a bottle of champagne waiting for us but did not receive a snack or fruit tray as others had but did not make an issue of it. We just opened our champagne and started to get into the relaxed island mood which is why we came. The bathroom layout was not an issue for us. If you are open with your partner and comfortable in their presence, there is nothing to worry about in this regard. The shower was fine with plenty of pressure and hot water. Maid Service: We tipped well the first 3 days ($5/day for the 2 of us) and received one towel arrangement but not much in the way of extras. I brought wash cloths from home so it made no difference to us if the maid supplied them or ot. After it became clear that my tip was not an incentive for anything out of the ordinary, I stopped tipping.Beach: Great, beautiful, beyond compare. No problem finding a palapa at any time of the day. Expect some nudity from the waist up. It is no big deal if you don't make it one.Pool:  Again, great, beautiful and beyond compare. We could have stayed in there all day long. There are active areas and quieter ones to suite every person's style. One day I tipped the man in the towel hut and he was so genuinely happy. I don't think many people think of tipping people in these lower positions. If you can do it, please do. Food: OK, not great. You will have plenty to eat but will never come away feeling like it was really special. We tried every restaurant and the Steak House by the Beach had the best steak and the service was really good too. Japanese (Benihana style)was one of the best meals we had. They were very personable and seemed to enjoy their job there. The Gourmet was anything but gourmet but you should try it for yourself to see. I only had 1 bout of intestinal distress and that was after eating at the Mexican/Taino Restaurant. It may have been the Goat Stew. The Main Buffet was good for Breakfast  Lunch. One week of the food was enough for us. We tipped at every evening meal and occasionally at the buffet if we had any money with us.Drinks: Good and Plentiful! The best bar by far is the upper lobby. It is kind of a secret I think. Most people don't bother to venture up there but they will make you a great Mojito and the Cosmopolitan's were as good as any I ever got in the States. We never waited for service and never had a communication problem at any of the bars. We tipped usually $1/drink and it may have been too much but they really appreciated it and the need is there so why not.Entertaiment: Fun to watch. The evening shows that bagan at 10 pm were a bit under par for other resorts we have visited. But, that didn't keep us away. It is very hot in that area and they really should utlize fans otherwise you sit and sweat. The seats are comfortable and I fell asleep during the Magic Show. It was pretty lame but the kids seemed to love it. The Animation Team was great and the Master of Ceremonies awe inspiring. He could rattle off in at least 5 languages. Very high energy group and good looking too! We really enjoyed the outdoor live enterainment that started around 7 pm. They had hors douevres and a signature drink each night and it was a relaxing and enjoyable time. Dancing was an option.Casino  Disco: We didn't do the casino and rarely did we see anyone there. The disco was OK but we only spent a few minues there and decided it wasn't for us. The young crowed will no doubt love it though.Caribbean Street: The prices at the shops were really not so bad and the workers were nice. They will give you change in dollars and not pesos and that is a plus. If you don't get off the property to shop anywhere else, buy your souvenirs here because they are 2-3 times as much at the airport.Excursions: Despite what they tell you, you can book your excursions before you arrive and you don't have to do it through your travel company. We found Monster Trucks on the internet and they met us there on our first day and gave us our tickets and all arrangements. It was a great day and we paid $85/pp for a full day in the countryside. I would recommend it. Don't bother going on the free cigar factory tour, it is not really a factory, but a small store where they want you to buy their cigars in large quantites. We did buy coffee and mamajuana there at reasonable prices however. I snorkeled one day and it was resonable at $29. Overall Impression:  We had a great time. It is a beautiful resort and we would return if we weren't the kind of people who never repeat the same thing twice. Jenny from Guest Relations contacted us on the evening before our departure to arrange for our luggage pick up and to help us with anythng we might need. This is beyond any experience we have ever had at other resorts and we have been to many. She personally saw us off too. How could you ask for anything more?

<Content>everything great except for buffets I have retured from our vacations two days ago. My husband and I plus another couple visited for 6 nights aug. 21-27. We are in our twenties. I have read almost every review of the majestic for the last month before going. My expectations were very high since it was the number one hotel in Punta Cana. We have visited Iberostar Bravaro ( number 2 on tripadvisor) two years ago and so I will compare the two.First of all the ride to the hotel is better than it was two years ago due to some better roads and it is faster now. We dropped off another couple at Iberostar Dominicana and we were at the hotel within 35 minutes. The hotel itself is soooo beautiful. After all it is only two years old. We were a bit early around 1:45 and the reception staff was very nice and said only one room is ready so we went to our room. Some of the staff at the hotel do not speak any English because my sister had two double beds in their room and wanted one king size bed and the trouble she went through calling and explainig through gestures when someone came who had no idea what she was saying. At the end they put their beds together . The rooms are beautiful. We loved the jacuzzi and the big shower except it didn't want to drain. The beds were hard but useable, the pillows were flat and the toilet area was small. The problem I had with the doors to the toilet was that they were not from the floor to the ceiling. We all know with all the food and the drinking, you will have some bathroom stinkness if you know what I mean and the door allows it to travel into the room. Thank god we brought air freshner. The mini-fridge had four sodas four waters and two beers. We kept taking out the beer so we could take it home and at the end of our stay we had eleven. We left our luggage in one room and went ot the buffet. Since it was our first day we all found something to eat. Then we went to make reservations to french and japanese restaurant.After unpacking and getting our room we went to seek out the beach and the pool. The water in the ocean was warm but refreshing and the same was true for the pool. The pool was magnificant.food- We went to all the restaurants and buffets and that is where we were dissapointed the most. For breakfast they had three stations where they made fresh food- Omlette, fried eggs, crepes. The rolls were nice and hot as well as the churros. Only one kind of ham , one kind of cheese, some cereals , some old looking hot dishes some pancakes and fruit. It was fine for three days but afterwards it got boring really quickly. I was tired of the same food each day. The watermelon and orage juice were great as well as the coffee. The services there was ok sometimes slow but you could see the guy with the coffee literally running around and so we waited patiently .Lunch buffet- the worst. The hot dogs and hamburgers are not the same as in United States. Both were terrible in taste. Watch out and make sure the meat inside is not red. The was a pasta station but I am not into pasta that much so for one day it was ok but the next day I didn't want it and so I had little choice. Paella, bacon, hard staek meat, sweet potato chips, potato salad, green salad and fruits and pastries. Soups were the best.. We usually were there around two all almost everything was cold and twice we went there after three and there was nothing there expect for the humburgers.Steakhouse-The best - first time chataubriand was burnt on the sides ( ordered well done) but still the inside was great. Second time after we hated the chinese place I took the shishkobob with chicken pork and steak and vegetables. Really good too.Chinese- Hated it - I had sweet and sour pork but my husband had lemon chicken and it was ok. Also the sushi buffet there was good.Mexican/dominican- It was ok. Don't take the sirloin because it takes like it was fried. I Had the fajita and it was good.Japanese- I thought they would do a show while cooking everything but no. The just grilled the steak, chicken, fish, shrimp and rice on the grill and thats all. The steak, rice and chicken were good. The shrimp and fish not really. It was a good meal but it wasn't the best as people hyped it up to be.Saefood- I had shrimp in garlic and it was great. My husband had the lobster and it was good too. We can't comment that much we are not big seafood people. To another person who eats seafood daily it might have been so so.French- The appatizers were not good but my chicken was wonderful and I tried some of my husbands surf and turf and it was good too. We had not complaints there and it was one of our better meals.Buffet- everything looked like it sat there forever and so we rather eat at a restaurant and have it fresh made.All the buffets need extra food and they really horrible expect for the salad, rolls and soups.The entertainment- We particapated in many funny games on the beach and by the pool. the entertainment team was nice. Only one person- Nelson remembered my name. I noticed that they really talked a lot to people that spoke spanish and bonded with them the most -understandable. The shows were good, the casino good as well -we lost some money there. The dealers are not really that nice. The disco was good but sometimes crowded so we only went there twice. At 11 by the disco they served food and my husband loved their buffolo wings. They also had calamari, fries, onion rings, ham and cheese sandwich, hot dogs and hamburgers.We also went on the four wheelers trip. we paid 85 for two people -in the hut by the steakhouse- Quadventure. It was great . Now comparing the two resorts Majestic has a better pool, more huts on the beach and by the pool, better rooms only because of the jacuzzi but then again if you don't like the open layout of the bathroom Iberostar is better. The entertainment team and the shows I thought were better at the Iberostar. The Iberostar is a bigger resort and I like the little houses a lot and their grounds were very beautiful. With the food- one plus goes to the Majestic for the restaurants and that you don't need to make reservations to most of them. Iberostar only lets you go to them 3 times for a week stay. One plus goes to the Iberostar for better buffets and wider selection plus their restaurant food was also really good. Last thing is that my sister got really sick with some kind of stomach virus. We brought immodium, extra strength petmo-bismol and nothing worked. For two visits, two shots, some medicine she paid 350 dollars. Her sickness kind of ruined our vacation a little bit but in Iberostar my dad got sick as well. Overall we had more fun in Iberostar but I recommend both resort for they are wonderful and beautiful.

<Content>majestic is royal We just got back from 5 glorious days at the Majestic. The service was impeccable from the moment we arrived and were greeted with a cool majestic welcome drink to the last day when cappucino's were specially made to order at our departure lunch. The rooms were cleaned everyday by 10 the refridgerator restocked and the staff was extremely friendly. The pool was incredible. Clean, warm, never felt crowded. There were activities to take part in if you wanted or you cold just sit and enjoy the atmosphere. There were always pool chairs under palapas on the beach or at the pool available. The food was delicious and the drinks flowed freely with very enthusiastic service at all bars and restaurants. We couldn't have had a better time. Thanks Majestic!!!

<Content>Great beach, Great resort,great country! I just came back from the Majestic and am missing it already. The resort was so clean and new - LOVED the ensuite jacuzzi. Food wsa great with lots of variety (there were four different a la carte restaurants). Beach was great and I really appreciated all the beach umbrellas that were always readily available. Staff was also very nice and willing to help (despite my lack of Spanish speaking skills). I developed a relationship with one particular beach concierge who was particularly helpful. Denny was his name-- he even taught me some spanish. The resort provides non-motorized water sports equipment but they close too early at 4, but that's my only complaint. Otherwise, the resort was just perfect.Oh, and remember to get your fill of the Majestic drink while you're there!

<Content>Want the Scoop on The Majestic Colonial? My wife and I recently traveled to Punta Cana with another couple, and stayed 6 nights at the Majestic Colonial. We loved it! Over the last several months I had done a ton of research and read a million reviews about the different resorts in Punta Cana. Several of the reviews that I read were about the Majestic. Almost everyone had nothing but great things to say, but there were a few people who thought otherwise. Let me just say, if you are looking to have a great time and want to feel welcome somewhere, then the Majestic is the place for you.We booked our reservation through the Vacation Store in Miami, and saved a ton of money by avoiding Expedia, Orbitz, and Travelocity. Seriously, it was a lot cheaper. Prior to my vacation, like many others on TA, I wrote several posts about what I should expect when traveling to the Majestic. To my surprise, I was getting answers from Emily who actually works at the resort. I was so pleased that I had someone providing me with great service, and I had not even left my home yet. She gave me insight on everything from restaurants to the water quality in the hotel.When we arrived to the hotel, we were greeted by a man with cold towels to wipe our faces. The check-in was smooth, and we were escorted to our room by Keyla (from the front desk). On the way to the room, she told us about several of the amenities, and all of the restaurants. We had a swim-up room (2138) and were directly across from the swim up bar and animation team (something that I asked Emily for prior to the trip and she delivered). The room was huge and in my opinion, would be considered superior accommodations in the United States. We had a bottle of champagne and some fresh fruit and cheese waiting for us in our room. This was a great way to start the vacation after a long day of traveling.During our stay, I was blown away with how nice the resort was. The beach was breathtaking, and my friend made a comment that it felt like we were in a Corona Beer commercial. There were plenty of chairs available, and it seemed like we got the same spot everyday. We made full use out of the free watersport activities, and enjoyed watching the entertainment staff teach aerobics on the beach. The animation staff convinced me to play Croquet, and I actually won. I was given a bottle of rum by Keiko for my accomplishment. If you see Keiko, tell him Tiger Woods says hello. The pool has to be the biggest that I have ever seen, and it was not crowded.The entire staff at the resort treated us like royalty. We dined at every restaurant,drank at every bar, and had only one issue where the service was sub par. I think that this may have been because they were in the process of closing for the evening. Otherwise, the employees hustled and worked their rear ends off. One piece of advice I will give you is to give gratuities to the employees. You are not required to, but it really goes a long way. We tipped $4-$5 at every meal for 4 of us. We also tipped our bartenders, luggage handlers, housekeepers, and anyone else who gave us great service.We did a few activities while there, including ATV rides, and a snorkeling trip. If you are interested in snorkeling, go to the Turinter desk and ask for Ronny. Ask him about the Caribbean Festival. They take you snorkeling with Lemon Sharks (they have no teeth and eat by suction) and Sting Rays (they remove the barbs, so they have no stingers),and then on the way back there is an open bar with national drinks, seasonal fruits, and cold cuts. This is a must!!Now I want to address some of the concerns that I have see on the Majestic forums.1) Food Quality - The food was above average. It was not outstanding, but it was also not terrible. There are 7 restaurants, so there is a good amount of variety available. I recommend the buffet in the front of the resort, the Japanese steakhouse, Le Gourmet, and the Steakhouse by the beach in the evening. We had dinner at another resort one night, and the food was not very good. From what I have read, the Majestic has some of the best food in the area.2) Bathrooms - The toilet area is a little small, but it was not what everyone is making it out to be. I am a 260 pound man, and I had no problems with the facilities. The shower is quite large, and it would have been nice if they would have given a little of that space to the toilet area. As for the door on the toilet room, they are similar to a bathroom stall. It was a little unusual from what I have seen, but it was not a big deal. If you are afraid of making noise in front of other people in the room, then have them turn the volume up on the tv.3) Bed - The bed was a little hard, but I slept great each night. I was a little stiff in the mornings, but it would only last about 5 minutes.4) Liquor - If you plan on drinking a lot, make sure that the liquor you like is available. I drink Captain Morgan Rum, and was surprised that they did not have it. They do have several other international brands of liquor available. My suggestion is to submit a post in the forum and a hotel attendant will respond back with whether or not you drink of choice is available. Major Tip For You: Go to Target and buy a Bubba Keg!!! They are only $7. Someone posted this recommendation and we did it. We looked like geniuses. It is so hot there, that the drinks melt very quickly. The Bubba Keg kept our drinks cold for hours.In closing, this resort was fantastic, and I plan on going back next year. We live in Florida, and could not have gone to Miami for less than what we spent to go to the Majestic (including airfare). Trust me, book your stay at this resort and you will not be disappointed. I hope this review helps you if you are trying to decide where to stay. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

<Content>Loved it! Just got back August 25. Had an excellent vacation, thanks to very attentive staff members and seamless, no hassle resort atmosphere. First off, BEWARE EXPEDIA as they NEVER MADE OUR RESERVATION until I called the resort personally. I have never, ever encountered anything like them. Expedia took the money but did not make the reservation,until I spent 1 hour with them the night before. I had to call the resort MYSELF to make sure that we were not without a room in a foreign country. A man named Norberto in reservations personally took control and fixed everything.He even met us at check in and escorted us to our rooms,even though it was an Expedia error. The entire stay, including food, drinks, staff, beach, room, were all flawless. The Dominican people are social, sweet people. Of several trips to the DR this is tops.Happy guests, happy employees, happy me!

<Content>Majestic Just OK Just came back from a 4 day Aug 19-23rd trip to The Majestic I will give the positives and the negatives you can judge.Positives1) Beautiful property2) great pool3) great beach4) very hard working staff5) Spa treatments were greatNegatives1) The food was awful except for the Steak restaurant we recommend the Chateaubriand2) Japanese and the Le Gourmet restaurants were a joke3) Drinks not top shelf and not much liquor put in unless you tip which we did4) We tipped our maid 4 dollars every day and there was never anything special done in our room which we upgraded to a oceanfront balcony suite not really worth the extra money as you are not really in your room Our recommendation is if you don't really care about the food being a problem this is the hotel for you.BRING IMMODIUM

<Content>peaceful and tranquil My father and I traveled to Majestic for 3 nights in August. My father had never been to an all inclusive and most of the time prefers adventures vacations. He said he has never been so relaxed in his life. Our experience was excellent from check in at the front desk to check out. Everyone was so nice and helpful and made sure we knew our way around the resort. We spent our days going to the beach at about 9:00am (I never had a problem finding a seat) and not leaving the beach till 5:00pm. We would occasional go in the pool through out the day for something different. We would go have a glass a wine and listen to music outside before dinner, very peaceful and tranquil. Then we would have dinner, we never had a bad meal. We ate at Matsuri (al a carte) the first night, Le Govermet the second night, and Tonino the third (this was both of our favorite restaurant, and my dad usually doesn't care for Dominican/Mexican cuisine). We would always end up at the sports bar after dinner before the crowd rolled in and end up staying longer and longer each night. The best part of the sports bar and the hole trip was Tyson, he was in the sports bar every night and on the beach every morning. He has such a huge heart , warm personality, and realy cares to know you, he truly touched my father and I deeply!

<Content>Incredible honeymoon at The Majestic! We went to The Majestic for our honeymoon and it couldn't have been better! The people were as nice as anyplace we've ever visited (which says a lot!) The beach was amazing --wide, sandy, white beaches with warm, clear water and plenty of chairs as well as shady areas, for those who wanted them. In addition, I have never seen such a beautiful, not to mention clean, pool. Considering the fact that it winds throughout most of the property and goes to within just a few feet of the beach, I still cannot figure out how we never saw so much as a single grain of sand in the water! As for the food, any reviewer who voices any complaints should take their next vacation to France or Italy, where gourmet food is part of the culture. This is an all-inclusive resort on an island in the middle of the Carribean. There was a wide variety of foods for any taste and you never had to have the same thing twice if you didn't want to. It was always hot, and there was plenty of it. The drinks were well-mixed, tasty and always available. That said, I do have a few pieces of advice to offer:  1. As mentioned, the drinks are plentiful, but are served in small-ish non-insulated glasses. I highly recommend bringing your own insulated mug with a lid (whether you're at The Majestic or any other all-inclusive resort.) The bartenders will be happy to put your drinks in it rather than their own and even if you're not drinking alcohol, it will keep it cold and if you take it to the beach the lid will prevent sand from getting in. 2. Bring a little more cash than you think you need. You won't need it at the resort, but for things like SCUBA diving, they charge a 17% fee on credit cards. Although there were several ATMs in the area, not a single one was working --at our hotel or any of the others along the strip-- the entire week we were there.  3. If you are traveling on your honeymoon, bring a copy of your marriage license and show it to them when you check in. We did and were given a fruit basket, bottle of champagne, complementary breakfast in bed and a special private couples dinner

<Content>A Very Good Choice! I felt compelled to contribute something to Trip Advisor because it was a valuable resource for me. Therefore, I am giving back to those of you who might be considering the Majestic Colonial as I was before booking our trip. I hope this review helps someone make the decision to stay at the Majestic Colonial.My wife and I, along with another couple, stayed here from 8-11-07 to 8-17-07. This was a relaxation trip for us and also an opportunity to spend some quality time with these very dear friends of ours. My friend and I scoured the internet, including Trip Advisor, to make the best decision we could sight unseen on which all-inclusive resort to stay at in Punta Cana. After finding that the vast majority of the reviews here were rather positive, and using our gut feeling, we booked the trip to the Majestic Colonial via a travel agent for the best deal.First, I'd like to address some of the more unfavorable reviews the Majestic has received, mostly because I know the slight doubt they placed upon my decision-making process. Everyone is looking for something particular in a vacation, and my idea of a good vacation might not necessarily coincide with someone else鈥檚. However, as a fairly well-to-do individual who does more than his fair share of business and leisure travel I must stress that the Majestic is a very good property. Based on my experiences in general when I travel, this resort should most certainly meet or exceed most travelers' expectations. To give you an idea of the quality and service level I consider excellent, I regularly stay at places like the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan, various Ritz Carlton properties, Bellagio in Las Vegas, and other properties of that caliber. I am not bragging here, but rather trying to let you know the experience I am used to.With that being said, the surroundings and accommodations you will find at the Majestic Colonial did not disappoint me. In fact, I was rather pleasantly surprised with the aesthetics of the property. In my opinion, it is my feeling that anyone having anything more than minor issues with the physical appearance or quality of the resort are more than likely nearly impossible to please. I hate to be so blunt, but some of the complaints I have read in reviews here are so petty I can鈥檛 help but imagine what a nightmare some of these reviewers must be any time they interact with a service-oriented business. Without even giving the Majestic a 鈥渂reak鈥? if you will, for being in a developing country this resort overall would give a lot of places in the U.S. a lot of competition. If you can鈥檛 be satisfied service-wise and with the surroundings here, you鈥檙e probably more suited for a country club somewhere and might want to consider lowering your standards to something more realistic.Now, I am in no way saying that the Majestic is perfect in every way. However, I feel that the majority of the concerns presented by others here are attributable to cultural differences as well as environmental and national economic influences. I will try to address some of the more commonly referred to 鈥渘egatives鈥?about the Majestic.As for the infamous and regularly occurring comments on the bathroom layout, it is indeed different than what we are used to here at home in the U.S. We stayed in a Junior Suite with direct pool access, and the spacious room is indeed basically one open space. Your bathroom area is in the front of the room when you first walk through the door. There is a double vanity with dual sinks that are on the front wall of your room. When looking at the sinks, your Jacuzzi tub is behind you and behind that is a space that opens to your bedroom/sitting area. To the left of your sinks on that left wall is the toilet and shower. Each of these has their own frosted glass door, and the shower is quite spacious and has marble floors and tile that match the marble floors of your entire room. The toilet is indeed similar to a stall in a public restroom and there is not much room in there, as we see in a public setting. When either my wife or me needed an extended stay in the restroom, the other person did indeed choose to go on the patio for a few minutes. In my opinion this is not the deal breaker that several reviewers here feel it is. Again, I just think that some people will always need and find something to complain about.The food and beverage situation is quite acceptable. Most of the food is quite middle-of-the-road quality, but at every sitting we always found something acceptable at the rather large buffet. Approach the buffet with the mental picture of something you might find in most hotels of upper quality in Las Vegas and you will not be disappointed. Breakfast was rather decent, and had some good selections. This looked the same on most days. Lunch and dinner were also acceptable, but if you found something you liked one day it might not be available the next day. They seem to rotate some of the featured items every day, but we did see some of the staple items were available each day we were there. Food is really a subjective matter, but I consider myself a somewhat picky eater and I did just fine there. As others have mentioned, out of all the specially-themed restaurants to choose from the steakhouse on the beach is probably the best. The Chateaubriand is truly very good, rivaling some of the nicer steakhouses I have been to.Finally, I wish to acknowledge the level of service at the Majestic. Our experience was that the vast majority of the staff here, with only one or two exceptions, were extremely accommodating and seemed to be truly committed to making our experience a great one. However, I must admit that we may have had an advantage- an advantage that I want to mention both for your benefit and for the gracious, hospitable staff members at the Majestic. This advantage is so obvious, it is a shame that it has to be mentioned at all. Tipping, folks. I鈥檝e read a lot about it here, and the offenders we saw might not be reviewers here, but we made a point to observe other people and most people do not tip this staff! Personally, I cannot understand why and neither could the other people with us on this trip. This is an all-inclusive and yes, gratuities are 鈥渋ncluded鈥? However, we don鈥檛 know how, if at all, they are distributed to the actual people serving you. When you鈥檝e basically covered all of your trip expenses ahead of time, I can鈥檛 for the life of me see any other reason for not tipping other than someone being extremely cheap or having no business taking a vacation. We tipped regularly and proportionally, and by Day Two were receiving the Royal Treatment everywhere we went. Sadly, it was at least partially due to the fact that by tipping the staff, we were in the minority. I can鈥檛 help but think that this probably explains why some people are reporting poor service. Something as small as $1 per round of drinks, or $1 per person per meal seems to go a very long way with the staff here. Other than the monetary compensation, I get the impression that the people appreciate the simple recognition of the hard work they do for you. Do like others mention in reviews here and get yourself a stack of one dollar bills from the bank before you head down there- enough to make sure you can tip as outlined above for the number of people in your party. I spent less than $100 on tipping for the entire six days my wife and I were there and feel that we did more than most people around us did. Also, leave a couple of dollars on your pillow each morning for housekeeping- they are the truly unsung heroes. If you can鈥檛 afford or refuse to do this, you either have severe financial problems and should reprioritize the need for a vacation or are simply a cheapskate.I鈥檇 like to wrap this up, so a few short comments on other areas. The beach- gorgeous. Soft sand with a pinkish color throughout when you hold it in your hand. There is a coral rock reef about 150-200 yards offshore that break the waves before they hit the shore, and a few rocks are close in. These are rather large and easy to spot- simply walk around them. This is by no means a rock-infested beach. The 鈥淎nimation Team鈥?is basically a group of fun-loving employees that organize beach and pool games, dancing, exercise routines, etc. Very fun- be open-minded and either participate or watch from the sidelines. The shows at night- Michael Jackson impersonator is entertaining, and we had fun hearing all the old songs and seeing the theatrics. We didn鈥檛 catch any of the other shows. If you are a rum lover, be prepared for strictly Dominican-branded options. I鈥檓 a rum guy, and ended up switching over to other options. The frozen drinks are made with their rum and they were good. We didn鈥檛 do too many of them in a row because the sweet drinks can be tough on you. Presidente beer is good- somewhat Corona-like.In closing, I hope this review comes across as a rational, level-headed approach to this place. It is truly a gorgeous resort, and the food and drink is decent especially considering the value/price equation of the stay. Staff is overall outstanding, and we only encountered one or two less than stellar experiences (mostly at the outdoor bar just behind the front main building and before the pool. Seemed hard to get service there at night for some reason). Bring dollar bills and tip- it goes a long way. Finally, book this trip and enjoy it. I know we will be going back!

<Content>What a wonderfull vacation! Let me start by saying first of all if you don't have a wonderful time at this resort, you shouldn't plan an all inclusive vacation trip, because nothing will make you happy.We stayed at the Majestic August 13th - August 20th. The Majestic is truly Majestic. Like every other review has said before the beaches are spectacular. White powder sand, blue clear water. We brought are 16 year with us and there is always something for him to do. I would advise you that tthey will serve alcohol to teenagers under 18. The staff was terrific, I can't say enough good things about Julio who works at the Steakhouse and Marlinn who works at the Mexican restaurant, they really know how to make your dining experience memorable.The Japenese restaurant was very good but hard to get in to, they have 3 rooms for the dinner show, and it fills up fast, the Lobster Burger at the French restaurant is superb.The rooms are great but remember no privacy in the bathroom, but if you know going in it makes it a whole lot easier, that why you aren't surprised. Hurricane Dean was hitting the carribbean while we were there caused no problems, the activities people still made sure you had plenty to do, thank goodness the hurricane didn't hit.A shore excursion that is a must is Saona Island, it is incredible, the water the sand the food, the open bar all included the catamaran ride was so relaxing. I believe this is a must, if you are planning on taking a excursion.

<Content>Perfect trip Incredible 5 star hotel. Quite new, so with perfectly kept instalations. Also the food was quite nice, better than other hotels on the area. And the best thing the beach, with enough space for all, and with a Beach Conciege called Denny that will bring you drinks if you ask him always with a smile on his face. Perfect for the I'm not moving feeling. Just incredible. But remember, do not go alone.... jajajajaja.

<Content>great service my two friends and I stayed at the majestic colonial hotel. I really don't have anything bad to say except the bathrooms. There wereno doors in the main part of the bathroom, only an enclosure in the single bathroon door and the shower door so it was like an open concept room.....But the service outshined everything. The pool concierge especially. His name is Danny Boy. That's what they called him. We were greeted everytime he saw us. He always sat and talked to us. I felt like a queen there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who has qualms about traveling to a hotel.They really make it out of their way to make you happy. I didn't encounter any rude people while we were there and i find this remarkable since there were probably a few thousand people they see everyday. I applaud them!

<Content>Lives up to the Hype! My boyfriend and I recently stayed at this resort, and neither of us have any complaints. The bathroom privacy was a slight issue, but it was a small inconvenience that was more than outweighed by all of the amazing things that can be said about this resort. The service was incredible - everyone seemed so eager to help you in any way they could. Staff always smiled and greeted you if you walked past them. The cleaning staff did a terrific job, even folding clothes that were inadvertently left out when we left the room. We tipped her 2 to 5 dollars per night, and were always greeted by beautiful towel art upon our return to the room.The resort is absolutely breathtaking. The beach was gorgeous. The food was good (not great, but good), and the animation staff was a lot of fun.We will definitely go back!

<Content>Problem with the ensuite bathrooms My boyfriend and I stayed in at the Majestic Colonial for the last week of July 2007.  The main and number one problem with the place is the washrooms in the hotel rooms. There really isn't a seperate washroom at all becasue the washroom is completely open to the main room where the bed is. There are stall like doors in front of the toilet and shower but no real privacy. This was a problem when wanting to use the toilet. Basically every sqeak squak and toot is echoed through the room is full living colour. My boyfriend and I would take turns stepping out of the room so the other person could use the toilet. This became a problem after the first 48 hours because we both had upset stomaches from the food and often had use the toilet urgently. I am used to having a full door on the washroom so that I can have a small amount of privacy to take care of personal things. The toilet problem really sucked because we found it make us uncomfortable.  As for the beach it was beautiful and there was always a place to sit. The bar and food were good but by no means great. The hotel is pretty and there are good live shows in the evenings.  Again, the bathroom thing spoiled it really. I wouldn't go back.

<Author>TheBlueWaterBreeze
<Content>Nice property, terrific beach My family and I just returned from six days at the Majestic. Here is a summary of things I feel that you should be aware of as you are considering this property:Things we liked:1. Compared to other properties in Punta Cana, this resort appears to be of medium size. Not too large like some of the neighboring ones. We found everything very convenient to walk to.2. The beach. Awesome. Clear blue water, great clean sand, gentle water, great scenery up and down the beach. No shells. Staff rake the seaweed every morning that washes up on the beach. Water was clean. 3. The cold pool at the Spa. Terrific way to lower your mid-day body temperature in a break from the sun. Under cover, fountains, soft music all available at no charge in a very convenient location.4. Main pool(s). Very scenic as they wind through the property. Some areas have a 7 foot ledge in about six inches of water allowing you to place a lounge chair in the water to tan. We had no problem getting lounge chairs at the beach or the pool.5. The steak chatieubriand dinner at the steak house. Very tasty, had it twice for dinner in 5 evenings. Things we did not like:1. Our daughter's cell phone went missing from our room. She did not place it in our room safe and it disappeared on our second day there. We did hear (and I did read) of others who had some similar experiences with room theft. We did report this to the hotel front desk and they seemed like it was my fault since it wasn't locked up properly. Please keep your valuables locked up in your room safe.2. The bathrooms in the junior suites. There is clearly a lack of privacy. There is a six foot frosted glass door separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom area. Sounds and natural odors travel freely. Since it is somewhat of an open bathroom format (no floor to ceiling walls), we actually taped a sheet up to provide some privacy between this area and the rest of the room. (Bring your own duct tape from home)3. Breakfast ends at 10 AM. You need to be in the Super Buffet restaurant by this time. For us on vacation and a desire to sleep in somewhat, getting there by 10 AM for breakfast was a bit of a challenge for us.4. We took the ATV trip Macao Crazy Wheels and found it to be a waste. Do not take this excursion. If you want to quad, find another company to do it with.Other things to be aware of:1. About 15-20% of women at resort are topless2. We found that English was the third most popular language there (behind Spanish and French). You may wish to brush up on your Spanish.3. If you go to the Mini-market to purchase something, or, if you wish to purchase some excursion or a water sport activity, you can NOT charge your room. You must use cash or a credit card.4. If you have a baby stroller you should stay in building 3 or 4. Building 3 would be the best choice. The bridges across the pool all have a number of steps. Building 3 has direct access to poool deck bypassing these bridges.5. Dress code for dinner. The only restaurant that really enforced this was the French one. All the other ala-carte restaurants we wore shorts too. 6. The steak and seafood restaurants for dinner are outside near the beach and not airconditioned. The rest of the restaurants for dinner are all air conditioned. Our room A/C worked fine too.7. We thought that our sofa in our junior suite was a pull out sofa bed. It is not. If you need another bed, you need to contact the front desk regarding a roll-away.8. There are no handles on the sliding glass doors on the outside on your patio. Meaning, getting back into your room if you are out on your patio can be a little tricky.9. My kids went tubing and had much fun. However, due to the type of tubes that the speedboats pull, they all got a number of bad brushburns. You may wish to do this towards the very end of your trip. 10. The food and drinks are okay. They are your typical all-inclusive resort medium quality. 11. The resort is about a 30 minute ride from the Punta Cana airport.Hope this helps. Please e-mail me if you have further questions.

<Content>Majestiic was Paradise!!!!!! Punta Cana, Hotel Majestic ColonialDate: August 17,2007We just came back from a 5 night stay at the Majestic resort. It had everything that you could possibly want. The staff was extremely nice and always tried to make you happy. The minute you walk into the lobby of the hotel you knew that you were in a special place. You received royal treatment immediately. Greeted with cool wash cloths  frozen drinks while checking in. The landscaping was absolutely beautiful with a huge swimming pool that winded around with fountains  bridges. A truly romantic place. Get ready to feel like royalty because that is how the staff treats you. The waiter Omar at the restaurant by the ocean was excellent.. He was the best... The food was excellent, The room was extremly large with a private hot tub. Don't miss out on the best vacation resort ever. The beach was unbelievably beautiful. 5 star all the way. Look for Denny (beach concierge) to bring you drinks, towels or anything you need.He was great. We absolutely loved it  plan to return to this paradise next year. Our first all-inclusive and we can't stop talking about it. We know why it was rated # 1.

<Content>Hotel Management - Issues Excellence at this property exists. From seasoned, patient ghost traveller, this journey in paradise began after 3 room assignments. Majestic Mike, where are you?3 items stolen before luggage arrived at room 2120. Management alerted. Our lovely maids did not steal from us. Luggage was opened and ransacted enroute to our room. Stolen-hairspray...jewelry bagNever happened to me before. It would be my pleasure to give the shirt off my back to anyone if they only asked. Hotel official given grande tip.Attitude is everything when spending hard-earned dollars. Respect is not something a ghost traveller should ask for .. anywhere.Sherman麓麓s No. 5 beach, Caribbean Jim's praise also, the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana - over 1 year old, needs direct attention by owners of said property. 658 rooms is very managible. Majestic Maggie Kid麓s Club Rules! Love, trust  fun. Survey of other guests, same problems- misdirected-pillaged luggage (not Customs). Then casual disregard of ghost's misfortune....

<Content>loved the hotel When you come in this hotel you will feel like in a dream. It is just beautiful. I can not find the right words to explain how beautiful it is. We stayed there 16 days. The rooms are very big and beautiful. All the people try to make you happy. During the day we were at the beach. I made a lot of funny games there. The animation team makes every day new things. They doing a very good job with a lot of power. It can麓t be boring. Thank you to them for the best animation i ever had. In the evenings you can sit outside and listen to good music. Everywhere are things you can do. Also the shows on the stage are fantastic.Not to forget about the restaurants. You eat there very good.I had a very, very good time there and it was very difficult to leave. When you go there you will feel like in paradise.

<Content>What a dream!! All I can say was that the week we spent at the Majestic hotel was amazing. The staff made it memorable and were willing to please. To overcome the language barrier, all you need is patience. They need to communicate with a number of different nationalities, not just english.... and they do a terrific job. The food was good and there is always a wide variety to choose from. The hotel itself is immaculate. I would go back in a heart beat. The spa is divine and we indulged in a variety of different treatments. The resort is very relaxing and just the right size. The only thing that ruined it were the americans who think that the world is there to serve them and treated the staff like they were savages... it was horrible to see. If they want american hospitality and food, they should vacation in the states and not venture outside of their country.

<Content>Beach Activities This was our second trip to Punta Cana. Our resort was beautiful. It was really fun being there. My family and I usually went to the beach. I have 1 child who is 13 years old, and when she was bored she would join in the beach activities. These activities were very fun and active. The games were setup by the entertainment group at the Majestic. However, there was only 1 problem. 1 woman who worked for the entertainment group, called Alexandra, did not let the kids participate in the activities. She would only let them participate after 3 parents complained and told her that our kids came to the beach to have fun and to join in the activities. Usually, adults don't play games. The kids are the ones who do enjoy doing those things. Alexandra was very rude and usually she rolled her eyes at everyone who insisted on letting children play the games. I don't think that this woman should be working as an entertainer if she's not letting people at certain ages play. Everyone else from the entertainment group let the kids play. The rest of the experience at the Majestic was excellent.

<Content>Majestic is a great, classy, perfect size resort I have stayed in Punta Cana before and it was at a very large resort that required trolleys to get around to the beach, lobby and restaurants. This is not so at the Majestic. It is the perfect size to walk to the beach, lobby bars or restaurants. I really enjoyed the ambiance and design of the upper and lower lobby bars as well as the statues and fountains around the properties. The pool is unique in that it winds through out the resort from the lobby down to the beach.The food was better than that at the other hotel I stayed. There was a wide variety of restaurants to choose from and the other benefit at this hotel is you do not have to make reservations at every one. Only 2 of the 7 restaurants require recervations which allows you more flexibility with your vacation plans.Our suite was very nicely designed with a comfortable bed and billows. We had a jacuzzi on one of the balconys with lawn chairs and chairs and table on the other balcony. There was plent of space in the room with a table and couch along with another table by the wall. Even though we had a jacuzzi outside, there was also a jacuzzi in the room.The sinks were double sinks with an individual bathroom and separate walk in shower. The mini bar was stocked everyday. If you wanted extra, all you have to do is ask. The tv/cable offered a wide variety of english speaking channels-which I though was great.Everyone working at the hotel was kind, attentitive and respectful.Overall, my experience at the Majestic was superb. If you are looking for a smaller hotel with a classy feel, the Majestic is for you.

<Content>Great Family Vacation I recently stayed at the Majestic (7/15-7/20)- we were a family of 6 adults 2 teenagers, 2 kids (6yr olds) and an infant, and we had a wonderful time. This was my Second trip to Punta Cana and I fell in love with the Majestic.When we arrived the check in was extremely easy, by the time we got to our rooms our luggage鈥檚 were there waiting for us. The rooms were clean and big! Great shower pressure, and plenty of clean towels. The maid service was excellent, I recommend that you introduce yourself to the maid, find out what her schedule is she may be taking care of your room the entire time you are there if so tip her at least $20 for the time you are there- you will be very happy! That鈥檚 what I did- she even folded the clothes my kids threw all over the place!The food goes without saying- everything there is excellent. When looking for a place to stay at Punta Cana one of the most important items is the food. The Majestic has the buffet and 7 restaurants step up right! The spaghetti station is the excellent- The Tiano restaurant has typical Dominican food that is great!The alcoholic beverages are strong! Parents be careful there is no id check for teenagers- it is very easy for them to get alcoholic drinks.The hospitality is extremely friendly - The staff all say Hola when you pass them! The grounds are great; the Pool is always clean, plenty of beach towels in the morning! The beach is gorgeous a bit too hot for the little kids.The kids club is entertaining but it can get boring after 3 days of the same activities. There are only 2 things that need improvement.One is the nightlife, they need more live music the entertainment needs a little bit of work Finally the entertainment staff needs more seasoned people. The are young and only curve to the older crowds, some of the activities are bit inappropriate for the young kids to watch. It is a family hotel, they need to work on having some family games/programs!This time around we left from Punta Cana airport- it is not air conditioned and they only have luggage carriers no carts- you end tipping 10 people! I prefer Santo Domingo Airport, it is further awaybut it is air conditioned, they have luggage carts! There is a very small selection of shops in the Punta Cana Airport- with younger kidsthe airport was a bit stressful for me.I am so looking forward to our next vacation- I know the Majestic is only going to get better!

<Content>Beautiful and Majestic We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Majestic.We were a group of six all in our late 40's.It was our first AI so I really have nothing else to compare it with.We really had the best vacation of our lives.Punta Cana airport was a bit overwhelming trying to find our shuttle to the hotel,once found we had the trip of a lifetime a bit harrowing but definetely an experience We will never forget.Arrival at the hotel was smooth met with a scented towel and the signature MAJESTIC great afternoon drink although each bar in the resort makes them differently definetely JAUN in the upstairs lobby bar is the master.We were then taken to our rooms,so beautiful evreything that you see in the pictures,we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and were met with champagne and some fresh cut fruit,nice.We then explored all that was there tried a cocktail in each of the bars!!! Make your reservations for the French and Japanese right away we were lucky enough to get the Japanese very fun little noisy but thats part of it.All the food was just delicous.So many choices in the buffet fresh pasta stations pizza, something for evreyone.We went to the steakhouse one night and the seafood another,although its the same place one side is steak the other seafood.Lobster and Chateaubriand both GREAT. Breakfast was fantastic fresh omlettes made to order waffles french toast etc etc.So much food you will be spoiled.The service was the best we just fell in love with these people the warmest most happiest people you could ever meet with smiles to die for.Can't say enough about the staff in all the restaraunts.Just lovely lovely people.TIP TIP TIP bring lots of singles these people truly deserve them.The pool was gorgeous never felt crowded always found the quiet spot when needed always a party at one end.The beach was breathtaking we went every morning after breakfast then down to the pool after lunch.Bring an insulated mug with you it really helps.We did one excursion The carribbeanfestival it was 78 dollars a person that was really worth it.Short bus ride to a HUGE catamarran did some snorkeling than the party starts the rum and music never stopped lots of fun!!will end this very lenghty review by saying if you go to the Majestic looking for a relaxing Fun vacation than that is what you will have.We can't wait to go back.ENJOY

<Content>Great Family Reunion We traveled to the Majestic from July 29th-August 3rd with 18 family members. We booked through Diane (Group Sales) at cheapcaribbean. (All went well!) The ages of our family ranged from 12-81. We had a nonstop flight from JFK which worked out great for our 4 families. The Punta Cana Airport was interesting. Even though we were aware of the $10 tourist fee, it still was confusing and a little unorganized. Also, on our Delta flight we were given a white Immigration form to fill out, however, the Dominicans wanted us to fill out a similar one in blue. The transportation to and from the hotel with Tourinter Tours, pre-arranged by cheapcaribbean.com, went well. It was a large air-conditioned coach. The ride was nice and took about 30 minutes. The guide tried to get us to meet with a rep the next day to schedule day tours. It seemed like he was trying to get us to think we had to meet with the rep to schedule our return ride. We didn't go. Instead, we went to the rep in the lobby of the hotel the night before we left and confirmed our ride back to the airport. Part of the departure terminal is air conditioned.The Majestic is beautiful!! It is uniquely designed and architecturally very interesting. The pool, the beach, and all our rooms (8) exceeded our expectations. Yes, there was a slight odor in the rooms, but as other reviewers have mentioned, it's probably the humidity and the proximity to the ocean. We didn't mind at all The weather was sunny and in the 90s everyday. We spent most of our 5 days on the beach (the best in the country!) and in the pool (the largest in the Caribbean). Every area of the incredible pool has its own personality. Numerous bars make getting a drink very easy. We saw the animation team in one area of the pool and one area of the beach. You can choose to be in a quiet area (left side of the beach)or a rowdy area. Our family used the kayaks, sailboats and went para-sailing. Two played golf and eleven went on the snorkeling excursion. FYI-the boat ride to the open ocean snorkeling is pretty wild. One of our favorite day and night locations was the open air beach bar and restaurant. For lunch, this large facility has two buffet areas serving salads, freshly made pastas, lunch items and desserts. We called the hamburgers mystery meat because one of our group members was a meat-cutter, and he wasn't sure what cut/kind of meat made up the hamburgers. They were really good though and many of us ate them. The open air buffet and airy atmosphere was perfect for our diverse family. At night it becomes two restaurants; Seafood on one side (we found the seafood to be overcooked, and the lobster fell short of our expectations) and Steak (other reviewers were right on the money about the chateaubriand; it was excellent!! The chicken was great too.) And with its ocean breezes, great bar, and romantic views, it made for great memories. We also dined at the French Restaurant (soups and appetizers were good, desserts were awesome, dinners were ok [surf and turf consisted of a piece of lobster the size of a quarter, the lobster hamburger was great] service was the best.) Japanese Restaurant (some family members liked it, others did not) and the Grand Buffet (always excellent). Everyone seemed to find something they liked wherever we went. We didn't eat at the dominican/mexican restaurant. We walked in, saw the goat soup, boar's head and other unfamiliar foods and walked out. Breakfast for us was always at the Grand Buffet and one of our favorite meals. Fresh fruits and fruit milkshakes, waffles, crullers, pancakes, French toast and omelets all made in front of you. Outside of the lobby there is a bar and large patio. In the morning, they have coffee, juice and fresh croissants. Great for early risers. The entire staff was very hard working and always wanted to please. We tipped at every opportunity. (On the bus ride in, you'll understand where these wonderful people really come from.) Yes, there definitely was a language barrier, but we all worked through it. At times it was funny. My sister wanted a little whipped cream on top of my mom's strawberry daiquiri, but instead, he put milk in it. Then, because they always try to remember your drinks, every time my sister ordered a drink from this one bartender, he put milk in it. We all smiled with him, as he thought this is what my sister wanted. We brought insulated cups and had the bartenders fill them with our favorite drinks (pina colada with extra rum and ice).The evening entertainment was mostly in Spanish, but still entertaining. They have some very entertaining, talented people performing. The lobby bar and piano bar areas are not air-conditioned, but they are so open and beautiful, we didn't mind. Several used the gym and enjoyed their time there. Many went to the casino. Be watchful of the casino employees raking your bets when it should have been a push. They will take the chips and cards quickly, sometimes before you have had a chance to check them. Also, check your chips before cashing in. But having said that, those that went had a blast and several of our party walked away a few hundred dollars richer. Two members of our family had some stomach problems for a few days, but overall we remained healthy. In closing, we all had wonderful time with the very friendly Dominican people at this incredible resort!

<Content>Fantasic hotel... shame about the toilets but it did make us laugh! I write as one of the few british people staying at the hotel!I took the opportunity of going to the Domincan Republic without my boyfriend. My friend and I shared a junior suite. I hope to give an honest review of all we experienced:-The Room - was enormous! The beds comfortable. I noticed that some rooms had the bed changed but I figured that that was too much Mama wama and not a fault with the beds!Our beds were made every day and clean towels provided together with the mini bar being re-stocked and new toiletries. i would recommend asking the mini bar people to give you specific drinks if like me you only drink the diet kind - they are happy to do so.The only issue I had with the rooms was the toilet. Being English my friend and I opted to just laugh at the lack of privacy when using the toilet, you can hear everything! As I wasn't on honeymoon it didn't matter, but if I was it might be a little embarrasing. That essentially was the only element to the hotel I wasn't keen on.The food:I am pleased to report that the food was good. I am a vegetarian. I don't think the Dom Rep was entirely equipped for a person that doesn't eat fish or meat. However I have to say that the mexican restaurant staff were fantastic. I had a freshly prepared vegetarian surprise every night! I think I was somewhat of a novelty! The other restaurants were not so accomodating but I really didn't mind as I was able to pop to the mexican before or after my friend had dined on delicacies. We liked the variety of being able to go to different restaurants.During the day we ate at the beach restaurant. The staff were very accomodating here also. The food was fine.The large indoor buffet was perfect for me also, I just preferred the mexican restaurant and as I have said the staff were great.The pool:We didn't use the pool as we prefer the beach in any event. However I have to say that the pool was the biggest I have ever seen. It never seemed busy and over populated as many hotel pools in Europe are. I would also say it was a safe pool as well.The beach:This was lovely! It was very clean. The water was lovely and clear. I usually have a phobia of going in the sea without some form of foot wear but it was lovely and I was happy to walk into the sea without shoes.What was great about both the pool and the beach was the fact that there were plenty of sunloungers available whenever you went to either - no need to take your towel down at 3am to 'bag' your sunlounger as happens in Europe!The staff:They could not have been more helpful. Our glasses were always filled up. As I have already mentioned the staff in the mexican restaurant were particularly good.The weather:I guess I should mention the weather although it has little to do with the hotel. I was concerned that being the rainy season it may be a disaster. It wasn't. The weather was fantastic. A few showers in the evenings which lasted about the duration of my actual shower so they did not matter.Arrival and Departure:Arriving at the hotel was so simple - no queues to negotiate. We were provided with cool face towels and welcome drinks which were very welcome after an 8 hour flight! It was stress free.Leaving the hotel was as stress free. The staff were very helpful.In all I am pleased I picked the Majestic... it was even better for the fact that the were so few English... I really felt like a foreigner and that can only be a good thing!Finally.... would I recommend the hotel.... yes I would!

<Content>Our first trip to Punta Cana This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic and I must say we were pleasantly surprised. I expected it to be a fairly decent place to visit but it was beyond our expectations. The Majestic Colonial Resort was absolutely awesome! When we arrived we were treated with friendly smiling personell and a nice cool cloth to cool ourselves off from the heat and a cool tropical drink to quench our thrist, talk about service, it was great!  The Majestic Resort was just as the name says majestic, the grounds were emmaculate with a swimming pool that ran the length of the resort to the beach. We had a wonderful view from our balcony of the pool area. The accomodations were also awesome! We had a choice of six restaurant, we tried a different one every day. They had a good variety of foods and of course we sampled every one of them. Our favorite was the Gourmet Restaurant. Our main reason for going to Punta Cana was to relax and enjoy the beach, there is nothing like the clear blue waters of the Caribbean. We will definitely be going back!

<Content>Falling Stars We selected this hotel based on the star rating and the alleged top shelf liquor. We were so dissapointed. The rooms were well sized however they smelled musty. The only place you could get beach towels was soo far away from the beach you needed to think twice before taking that long walk. If you pay for Top Shelf Lliqour , good luck in finding it. The only locations that you can have a top shelf cocktail is at the bar close to the lobby, (but no one tells you this). So, if you are dining at the Restaurants by the beach, you would need to walk a long, long way to obtain your drink. We made arrangements for a nice bottle to be made available to us for a special occasion,at the Restaurant by the beach, what a fiasco that turned out to be. The bottle never arrived and no one could figure out why the bottle was not there and worst of all, none of the restaurant staff had the authority to go and pick one up . All of the hotel staff tries to cover for all of their mistakes. No one actually admits to any of their faults. This hotel should be rated three stars at most.

<Content>Tha staff is what makes this Hotel a 5 star. This was our second trip to Majestic and we found it to be even better than last year. We were received with cold wet towels to refresh from the warm weather, followed by a cold fruit smoothie type of drink. Checking in went very fast, as a matter of fact we got to the hotel at 1:00 p.m., the check in time should be 3:00 p.m. and we were given a room at that time with no problem. The staff at the front desk is very professional and friendly. Special thank to Rosmery, Leo and Francisco for making check in so smooth. Our room was a pool view junior suite; we never had a problem with the room not being clean, missing towels or the mini fridge not being stack with beverages or chocolate bars. Special thanks to our maid (Luz) for making sure I had chocolate bars re stack every day. The rooms are different, the laid out is unique I could say, if you are not comfortable with an open area room, this hotel might not be for you. We are a family of three and we had no problem with the lay out of the room, the bath tub is right in the room, we never used it, we only used the shower. What we did was when it was time for my husband to get dress my 9 year old daughter and I would sit in the balcony enjoy a drink or a chocolate bar while we looked over the beautiful pool.The pool is beautiful it is so big that it never feels crowded, we always stayed by the wet bar since that鈥檚 the area where they have the activities during the day. There is always music playing by that area. The activities are so much fun, if you really want to have a good time you should participate in at least some of the activities. If you prefer to just relax and not be bother there is plenty of area by the pool where you can do that. Remember the pool is as long as the hotel is. Special thanks to the bar tenders at the wet bar, Tiburon, Ismael and the rest of the crew. They are great hard working people.Entertainment team, what a blast! This people are amazing always trying to make you have a great time with different activities. There are games, aerobics and a lot of fun by the pool with these guys. There are also nightly shows some better than other, but we enjoyed it. The entertainment team was what really makes us decide to go back next year. Thanks to Sandy, Jesus, Julio, Kelly, Alexandra, Samuel, Maria and all the others for getting us involve in their activities and for making us laugh so much. We鈥檒l see you next year.The food was good, I would say depending on your taste. Our favorite restaurant for dinner was the sea food restaurant, the Steak was also good and the Taino. For lunch we ate mostly at the restaurant by the beach since you can go on your bathing suit, we found it to be easier than changing clothes to go to the main restaurant. Breakfast was good even the pickiest eater will find something to eat, there is a very large variety from fruit to even rice if that is your thing. The waiters are great; they work so hard to make sure you have everything you need, always re filling your drinks, removing your plates and asking if they can get you anything else. A special thank to Joel, Nokel, Jorge Luis (both Jorge) to name a few of the great waiters. The beach I can鈥檛 say much since we mostly stayed by the pool, I did go for a walk 2 times and it look very clean and there was a lot of hut for every one.Last but not least, the kids club. It is a very nice place for you to leave your kids for a couple of days so you can have a little time for yourself. My daughter had so a great time with Magy that all I hear is 鈥淚 want to go back to see Magy鈥?She is the best with kids. Thank you so much Magy for making our stay so great. We鈥檒l see you next year. I hope my review is helpful. I recommend the Majestic to anyone who is ready to have a Blast.

<Content>A pleasant experience Vacationing with two kids that was our first time in Dominican and Majestic did not disappoint. Great beach, extraordinary pool, friendly staff and good looking/spacious rooms made this vacation memorable and enjoyable. Another important asset of the hotel are roof covered walkways - you won't likely to get wet if you happen to be outside during the rain storm. There're a few areas of improvement needed though to make it a family friendly five star resort as they claim it to be.1 Food is not up to the expectation. Very few choices for dining, not enough variety except for the main buffet (not exactly the place for having a romantic dinner).2. Excessive amount of rated R content in some of the nightly shows that have many children below 12 in attendance (although the cirque and the magician's shows were truly world class). Michael Jackson show while entertaining was inapropriate for younger audience - my kids were terrified and we had to walk out (along with many other families with kids).3. Kids Castle - kids run around and jump on the waterslides - it is fun, but we didn't feel safe to leave our kids unattended.A few important tips:1) Bring a lot of sun cream2) Bring something against mosquitos and use it daily3) Get the towel cards for every family member as you arrive4) Make restaurant reservations as soon as you arrive5) Tip the staff and the maid for better service6) Know at least a few words in Spanish7) Don't drink or mouthwash local water unless it is in a bottle.Overall, it was a pleasant experience - if we ever go to Dominican again it is likely we consider staying in Majestic.Thanks for reading

<Content>Sleepless at the Majestic I was happy to leave the Majestic yesterday to return home for a good night sleep. The beds and pillows in room 3412 were horrible! My husband, 12 year old son and I shared the junior suite. It was huge but I felt that I was sharing a honeymoon suite with my son. There were no doors for the tub and a stall door for the toliet. We were going to upgrade to the one bedroom suite but we would have given up our wonderful view of the garden, pool, and ocean. We showered instead and lit incense while using the bathroom. There were no dull moments at the resort. The pool area offered entertainment, aerobics and games everyday until 6:00pm. The same type of activities were going on at the beach but this is mainly where everyone went to relax. (This is usually where my family took their naps.) If you want to drink on the beach I would suggest you bring a large insulated cup. There is a short walk to the bar and Benny is the only waiter for the entire beach.All of the stage shows take place in an outdoor theater at 10pm. It is quite warm and mosquito infested. I brought mosquito spray from home and sprayed our seating area everynight. The best show of the week was Micheal Jackson which is performed on Sundays. Don't miss it!Overall, the food was good, the staff was friendly, many shops on the premise, an outdoor market once during the week, and most important complaints are taken care of immediately. Repeat visitors expressed this was the best resort on the beach.

<Content>Honeymoon at Majestic Hi everyone.We just returned from the Majestic where we spent our Honeymoon from 28 Jul to 4 Aug 07.I'll address everything by sections to keep this short and sweet.Airport: Wow: short and sweet, 30 mins to the hotel. 10$ tourist card was included in our package (flew with Sunwing). You do need the 20$ departure fee when checking in on departure.Check-in: Amazing service on arrival. We had a VIP/Honeymoon package so they assigned someone from the Guest Service desk to assist us for the check-in. Took us aside and made all our a la carte reservations right away including a special honeymoon romantic dinner at the seafood restaurant.Room: we ended up in 2217 (block 2, 2nd floor, room 17) which faces the pool in front of the towel hut and pool bar. Great location as it's not too close from the swim up bar where the activities take place but close to everything including lobby and restaurants but only a short walk to the beach. Room itself was beautiful with Jaccuzi. As per our VIP/Honeymoon package, we received a bottle of white wine and some finger food at the room the first 2 nights (around 5pm), a fuit basket and champagne on arrival and a breakfast in bed on Tues morning. Amazing.Restaurants: This is where the resort lacks a little bit in quality. The buffet is pretty varied and offers some very good items. The a la carte are somewhat comparable to all other resorts we've visited. The Japanese is pretty good but is also pretty typical with 8 folks sitting around the cooking table where the chef prepares the food and then serves everything at once on a plate. The steakhouse is pretty good also other than they cook everything early and re-heat the food as necessary (this is why your steak arrives in about 10 mins...). Don't go there at 10pm as you will get the leftovers (we did that one night and the brochetes were overcooked and hard). Our romantic dinner was at the seafood and we were assigned our own server with a nice table at the edge of the pool. We didnt' get to pick the food but ended up with some gamba and small beef filets which were OK. Carribean/Mexican wasn't great but offered variety. Again, overall, lots of choice but I wouldn't compare the food to a Sandals as far as quality. But the important thing here is we didn't get sick and didn't loose any weight... LOL!Beach/pool: amazing. Always room under Palapas and plenty of chairs regardless of time of day. We did the beach in the morning and pool in the afternoon and never a problem. Pretty windy on the beach the last couple of days so sand everywhere so we stuck to the pool more. Never a problem exchanging towels either (we did 2 or 3 times a day).Activities: typical stuff going on at the beach but mostly near the swim up bar. This is where everyone would go for a drink and watch around 4pm everyday. Shows: again typical. We watched 3 nights. The best was the Michael Jackson. Other nights were the typical guys against girls, Mister Majestic etc... Sad thing is that the shows don't start until 10pm, very late....Disco: we managed to stay up one night and made it to the club where everyone ends up right after the show is over (around 11pm). Only carribean music but a good crowd on hand when we went.Gym: not bad for a resort gym. There is AC but the door is always being opened by some curious folks so it does get warm.There is an attendant there who looks after the eqpt/towels etc... He's constantly near you as you're working out so it can be a bit annoying. Lot's of bikes/treadmill and some free weights and nautilus eqpt so you can have a decent workout.Service: well, I'm going to choose my words carefully (as my wife said... so not to offend anyone here). I'm only indicating this as to offer advice for those who are seeking a resort with a specific clientele and staff. First off there is an issue with english speaking staff. Most don't understand english at all although the Guest Service staff are incredible and fluent in english. However, most servers or shop attendant don't speak much english. Lucky for us we also speak french and some of those did too so we managed. The ladies at the mini-mart were extremely serious, never smiled and got offended when my wife was looking at T-shirts (unfolding them to see the logos...). Additionally, most of the customers are spanish speaking. Again, not trying to offend anyone here. I believe that this resort caters to those folks a bit more as the majority are spanish speaking. This is perfectly acceptable and might not be something the resort was looking for originally. It wasn't a big issue for us but if you are a french speaking person from Quebec city who doesn't speak english or spanish, you might wanna reconsider. For us, we managed well and still had a good time relaxing. Just didn't meet that many foks.Check out: very quick. Check out at 1200 hrs. On the bus within the hour. Airport check-in done in about 30 mins.Overall: We had a very good, relaxing honeymoon which was exactly what we wanted. However, I don't think we would go back to this resort. Again, the issue of staff and clientele was very surprising to us and different from other resorts we've visited where we've met many different people. Surprisingly, there were many, many kids at this resort which wasn't really indicated in the reviews. Although kids are allowed, we thought that this was mostly an adult type resort. Obviously, families are choosing this resort more and more which is very OK as it is very a nice place.The resort itself is beautiful, service in most cases is above average but some areas as indicated above could be improved.Hope this can help some of you in selecting your dream vacation.

<Content>Great Trip...would bo back!! My group traveled July 28th-August 2nd and we had a great time! Please email me with any questions you have and I will be glad to help answer anything I can.Check In:Arriving was easy, we were greeted with Majestic drinks and warm towels. Check in was a breeze. We were given a room very close to the beach and the check in person, Manuel even made reservations for us at the 2 gourmet resturants at check in. Someone walked us to our room, gave us a brief tour of the facility and welcomed us to our room. Great service so far.Rooms:Very nice. Plenty of towels, pillows, stocked fridge. We never had a problem getting new towels, more drinks, a clean room, etc. Everything was perfect with the room. Yes the beds were a little hard but we had no problems sleeping. After a long day in the sun and drinks, you will sleep like a baby. The only small thing I can say that I didnt like about the room was that I couldnt ever get it cool enough. The temp wouldnt go below a certain degree and we slept with only a sheet at night otherwise we were always hot (sunburns could have had something to do with that). No musty smells, it was always always clean, etc. Toilet area was a little different but my husband and I didnt seem to mind with it just being the 2 of us.The beach:OK, this is what makes Punta Cana such a wonderful place. This was the best beach I have ever been to. The water is beautiful, the sand is awesome, the views are breathtaking. Enjoy the beach...you will love it. Always had loungers available and things to enjoy: snorkeling, kayaking, wind sailing, massages, tattooes, etc. There is a place where you can pay for water sports not included: parasailing, banana boats, scuba etc. The guy working this booth (which is not affiliated with the hotel) is soooo rude and service is sooo slow).The pool:Nothing is better than a HUGE pool where you can always find a place to hang out. Lots of room, lots of loungers, always got drinks quickly. I even had someone serve me drinks when I was on the loungers and not in the pool. The water is cool, refreshing and kept clean. The pool winding throughout the whole resort makes the entire resort all that much more special. The food:As good as other all inclusives I have stayed at if not better. The beachside resturant didnt have a very impressive lunch. The lobby restaurant is much better for lunch. Breakfast was OK....the waffles hard and scrambles eggs runny but that can be nitpicking. The dinners were always wonderful. No complaints about any of the dinners. The only thing I really hated was that breakfast is only served until 10 and lunch starts at 12. So if you miss breakfast and youre starving, you will only have a fruit and bread tray to eat from. This is the 1st time I have stayed at an AI and there wasnt more offered at the down times. Room servce would have come in handy here but that cost $$$. Overall the food was good...sometimes wonderful, sometimes OK. I have been to several nice AI resorts and I would say they food was as good, sometimes a little better yet others whom I talked to said that Majestic's food was the best they had ever had. So its all in comparison to what you have had.The drinks:We learned on the 4th day there that the downstairs lobby bar has premium liquor. If you ask for it they will serve it. The smaller bars around the pool do not have these liquors. The drinks were good for the most part. Keep in mind that this is not Mexico and they tequila drinks will not be the same as Mexicans would make it. They have their own specialty Dominican drinks that are great though. JUAN who works at this bar is GREAT. We are from Texas and every night he would yell Texas! and give us the Hook 'em Horns sign that we taught him as we walked into the lobby. Get to know him. He is at the bar every night.The casino/entertainment/disco:Casino was fun at night. This is the only place where I found the staff to be very stand off-ish and somewhat rude. The slots and video/machine games do not despense money. You actually have to call a teller over to collect the $5 you won. Everytime I felt like I was bothering them. They will try to jip you on your winnings so watch the amount of money given to you when you win.The shows at night were great. Very entertaining and you can tell that the animation team and staff work very hard and a lot of work goes into what they do. This is the first resort I stayed at where we actually went to the shows every night and looked forward to them. Danny the MC is great. It was kind of annoying that everything is performed in English and Spanish....sometimes we had a very hard time understanding what was going on. It was almost as if 80% of the audience was Spanish speaking so they were mainly being catered to. And sometimes it was hard understanding the english version...accents are thick. But were were in a Spanish speaking country so I couldnt expect everyone there to speak clear english. Most wait staff understood enough english to get us what we needed. They try very hard so that counts for something in my book.The disco had its fun night and its dead nights. Once again most of the music was spanish/latino music that we didnt understand or never heard of. Tyson who works at the bar in the disco is worth going to disco for. He is fun and entertaining. Great guy and great bartender. He works every night so get to know him.  As most readers have said, this is definetly a resort for couples and families. The night life is somewhat dull after the show but they have several things going on throughout the evening until the show starts. It would be really hard to get bored here.Excursions:Few and far between. This is not like mexico where there are 76 different excursions to choose from. They offered about 8-10 and only 3-4 looked appealing. We did the snorkeling trip withe the sharks/stingrays that I highly recomment that. Lots of fun. My husband and I are more beach/pool/relaxing vacationers so the lack of excursions wasnt a big deal to us.One last thing I would like to add is that the Dominican people are very very nice. It is a very happy, entertaining, friendly culture. Enjoy all it has to offer. The staff was soo nice to us. They work hard and we always tried to tip something to let them know that we appreciated the service they gave. They do a good job. In all this resort is a wonderful place to stay. We would go back to it in a heartbeat. The few things I have complained about are all small in the grand scheme of things.

<Content>Great Value! Wonderful Staff! This facility is just over a year and a half old. I have yet to be at a place that was more eager to serve. Any service issues were at result of some language problems. I think this will only improve, as the staff comes in contact with more Americans. The grounds, the rooms, the restaurants were beautiful and very clean. Staff was constantly policing the beach, the pool, walkways to pick up any litter left behind. The beach is idyllic, the water is sparkling. The food at the seven restaurants is good, not great. There is a restaurant for everybody and every dress. You could virtually get food 20 hours a day. Suggest if you want to go to the more upscale restaurants that you make reservations at check in. Our room was stocked with soft drinks, 2 beers and 4 bottles of water which are included and replenished each day. The bar service and choices of drinks were excellent. Evidentially, there are different levels of guest status. Not certain how that worked. I do know that the grey wrist band that my family and I had included premium liquors which were not generally available. If there was a problem, it may be a cultural issue. The unit I had was super. We had a view of the ocean from the balcony, a small refridgerator, competent A/C, ceiling fan, double vanity -- but alas, no bathroom door. The very large shower and the toilet were entered from the general area via a opaque glass door. The shower wasn't much of a problem. But the toilet was also entered via an opaque glass door. The set up was much like a public stall toilet with an opening at the bottom and at the top. The door is glass and frosted, but may be uncomfortable for those accustomed to more privacy.This resort provides real value. I would be remiss if I didn't mention some outstanding staff members who went out of the way to make our stay more pleasurable. Janet, Leo and Rosemary, at the front desk; Bladimar at the lobby bar and Angela and Emely at customer service. Thanks guys.

<Content>Memories That Will Last a Lifetime!! First with the negatives....After reading over 25 reviews before going on our honeymoon, I was a little surprised at the lack of English spoken in the Dominican. This was not something that I had ever read, but I believe this is really important to note. YES, I know, we are in their country, and need to experience their lifestyle, which is why I suggest going ONLY if you are fluent in Spanish, will learn some before you go, or you do not care if you can communicate or not. Yes, some people who work there speak English, but the majority of the activities are done in Spanish (at least in the pool area). My husband and I were both surprised by this, and we spoke to other couples who felt the same way. Even those who could speak English made us feel bad when we talked to them in English (we often got dirty looks, rolled eyes, etc) and YES, we did attempt to speak Spanish (we always greeted with Hola, and asked for drinks or food in the best Spanish we could). Now, on to the positive aspects of the Majestic Colonial.....our honeymoon was amazing! As far as the appearance is concerned, the Majestic is beautiful. When we walked in, it took my breath away! The pool goes on forever, and the beach was great! We never had a problem finding a seat at the beach or pool area, and there was always a bar open close by. We found that the drinks were a little watered down, but we aren't big drinkers, so this was not a problem for us. Make sure to get a drink called the Majestic---it is delicious! We found the bar in the lobby to serve them the best--but they are good anywhere! Also, many people mention the bathroom being open as a bad thing---what they are not mentioning is that that is only the case for the bathtub. There is a shower with a door, and the toilet has a door, so those are very private. The shower is huge---you could easily fit 2-3 people inside! We used the bathtub, but we were on our honeymoon, so it was wonderful for us, but there is not a need to use it if you are uncomfortable. The staff at the water activity hut is amazing! They were, by far, the nicest at the resort! They have staff available that can speak fluent English, German, French, and Spanish, so this was wonderful! Snorkeling was hard b/c you are only allowed to stay in a certain area, but we did see different kinds of fish. My husband loves kayaking, so he took out the kayaks a lot, and never had to wait to get one. We tried boogie boarding, but there was a lack of waves, so this did not work too well.We booked our trip through CheapCarribean.com and this worked out great! They had an agent named Noel at the Majestic and he was extremely helpful. He spoke English well, and set us up on 2 excursions that were great! My husband and I both recommend doing the ATV ride! It was amazing! We recommend getting your own ATV, and make sure to get a helmet with a visor--you will thank us for this later! haha! Bring your camera on the trip and wear your bathing suit, b/c you will be stopping at the beach for a few minutes! We also took the tour to Sanoa Island. We had a good time on this excursion, but we felt that a lot of the time was spent driving. We had to leave at 6:30 am and did not get back until 7:30 pm. It was a long day. The food at the Japanese restaurant was delicious. The food at Le Gourmet (the French restaurant) was great except for the appetizers (they made my husband EXTREMELY sick for 2 days). The Caribbean restaurant was okay. We ate at the main buffet the majority of the time, and found the food to be pretty good. There is a great variety--something for everyone! We never tried the shows (we were outside all day, so we were relaxing in our rooms usually by 10:00) The movies were cute though, and we heard good things about the shows. Overall, we had a great time. We found 7 days to be too long, but by the 6th day, my husband and I both had stomach problems, which was probably why 7 days seemed so long! Like I said earlier, the only thing that caught us off guard was the lack of English spoken, however, since we were on our honeymoon, we didn't need to talk to other people much....we just would have liked to participate in some of the pool activities, but they were in Spanish 80% of the time we were there. We LOVED having our room right by the pool, and found this to be an extremely relaxing trip, with lots of great pictures! I doubt we will go back anytime soon, but we will have our wonderful memories for years to come!

<Content>July 15-22 2007 We stayed at The Majestic from July 15-22. Overall we had a great time. The resort itself is beautiful and the pool is spectacular. The rooms are great with one exception...the toilet room. We had an ocean view room and the view was great. The food was okay, but you have to remember they are cooking for so many people/cultures. I found the steak house and buffet were the best. All the wait staff and house keeping staff were really sweet...no complaints in that area. However, the cashiers in the casino were very rude. The entertainment team were fabulous. We always sat at the section of the pool where they would come and play games. We did the water aerobics a few times and had alot of laughs. Our only real complaint would be the other tourist. I am not sure from what country they were from but they were very rude. They would jump in line at the buffet, push you out of they way or just run into you and act like it was your fault. I am a Southern American and we were always taught to mind our manners so this was very different for me. After a few days of it you just got used to it and expected it. We went on the 4 wheeler excursion and had a blast. If you are planning on taking that excursion (or the doon buggies) please make sure you bring clothes you have no problem throwing away and closed toe shoes. You will get filthy but it is so much fun! Also be warned the Punta Cana airport is not air conditioned so on your return flight home wear warm weather clothing. We were soaked when we boarded the plane. Another thing, if you plan on going on the excursions, bring candy. The children will hear the bus/ATV and will come running in hopes of candy. This area is very poverty stricken so that is the only real treat they get. Also, we left a few dollars each day for housekeeping with some candy. Bring alot of 1's and 5's. It was hard to find anyone in the resort that wanted to break a 10 or 20. We also left a few bucks each time we ate for the wait staff and they were very grateful.

<Content>Beautiful resort.... We visited the Majestic from July 11 to July 18. The hotel itself is gorgeous. The beach is nice and the pool is FABULOUS!! Nicest pool my boyfriend and I have ever seen. We were very disappointed with the food. The food at the buffet was always cold.... at breakfast the waffles and pancakes were hard, the eggs were always undercooked and gooey... so after the second day we just skipped breakfast every morning. We never really found anything we liked at the buffet for lunch or dinner except the pasta. The pasta was great, the bolognese sauce was decent... so for the last 4 days we ate the pasta for lunch and dinner. We tried 3 of the restaurants, and the only one we kind of liked was the Dominican restaurant... the fajitas were very good. We asked for cheese and got beef. This is how serious the language barrier is.Our biggest problem I would have to say was this language barrier. Most of the staff does not speak English very well. LEARN SPANISH BEFORE YOU GO!! We learned a little and thought it would be enough... but we were really lost. Learn how to ask where the bathrooms are, where to get food at night, and learn how to ask for your beverage of choice IN SPANISH!! They didn't understand us when we ordered our drinks (just asking for a Jonny Walker on the rocks we got a full glass of JW with a bottle of water on the side....??). If you ask for mustard you will get mayonnaise. (BTW mustard= moustaza) It was a lot more difficult than we ever thought it would be.The beach was very nice, you could walk for miles in either direction. However at the Majestic be careful when you're in the area closest to the resort... we found about a dozen pieces of glass... where they came from I have no idea... but make sure you wear your flip flops when you're on that part of the beach. There is NO information about the resort in your rooms. The staff at the front desk don't speak a lot of English so it is difficult to get any questions answered. Make sure you do some research on the hotel before you go, and like I said before, learn Spanish or better yet: buy an English to Spanish dictionary!! Our vacation would have been a lot better with one of these handy.The workers at the casino are SO SO RUDE... the bartenders are GREAT, the waiter was soooo nice,.. but the dealers are incredibly miserable. Watch out when you play blackjack. They scam you big time. Twice the dealer took my money when it should have been a push, but they take the cards away so fast you don't have time to say anything... the first time I let it go, and the second time I demanded to see the cards... the dealer got very upset and the pit boss came over, the dealer argued with her in spanish and then stormed off. The pit boss then just gave me my chips back but really it didn't make me happy. Other people at the resort had the same problem. Also be careful when playing the machines... the power went out 3 nights in a row for almost an hour over the entire resort. There is a computerized roulette game (which is sooooo fun!) BUT if the power goes out, you lose all the money you had in it. When we spoke to a couple that lost over $100 because of the power outage we were sure to cash out every time we hit $20, just in case the power went out again.I'm rating this hotel a 4/5 mostly for effort and for beauty. The resort really is stunning. Lots of trees, and it is very well taken care of. It's not really our type of resort however, or maybe just that the Dominican isn't really our ideal vacation spot. If you prefer to have the type of vacation where you just lie on the beach or by the pool all day, than this resort would be great for you. We are the type of people that like to wander into town, see the sights, go on excursions and stuff like that... and unfortunately Punta Cana doesn't really offer anything worthwhile.Oh and DO NOT BOOK WITH HOTELBEDS. They are awful. The shuttle on the way back was leaking and it completely ruined one of our pieces of luggage, and some items inside the suitcase. We wrote to their customer service department and haven;'t heard anything back. If you did book with Hotelbeds, then don't go see your rep, there are tons of other reps at the hotel that will be happy to help you book any day trips and stuff... and splurge for a taxi to get you there and back. Its worth the money to avoid this company, trust me. To be quite honest, we were not impressed with our vacation. But I try to be objective (hence the 4/5), and I can understand why people return to the Dominican and to the Majestic again and again. We were celebrating something special and the hotel sent us a couple bottles of wine as well as chocolate covered cherries and a platter of sushi. We were impressed and thankful by this gesture. The rooms are beautiful as were the hotel grounds... we will not return but I do understand why other people love it and do come back. It's just a personal preference I think, and if you do prefer to be more active on your vacation than I do not suggest this resort, or Punta Cana in general. It is by far the prettiest resort in Punta Cana though. So if you have been to the Dominican before and love it, I would definately suggest this resort (just don't forget your dictionary!)Cheers!

<Content>Not Meet Our Expectations!! We (Group of 28 people) Travel Last Week to Majestic Colonial for 8 days and the expectations of the hotel changed complettly. First when the group arrived ( 4 of us were older 80 years old) and their rooms were so far away that they practically stay in their rooms for the whole trip, the rest of us were scatter throughout the hotel. The rooms were nice but there were never enough towels and went you went to your room at 3pm the room was not made yet. The small refrigeretor in the room never had regular drinks, everything was diet. When you ask to the reception for beverages, towels or pillows they never arrived. On the Carabelas Seafood Restaurant the service was horrible specially a waiter named Nerido, he is supervisor of the restaurant and he did not want to sit our whole group together or close, we had to talk with the general manager who inmidiately resolve the problem, this guy was disrecpectfull the whole night and the next day he and his staff stop a member of the group in the exit of the pm buffet next to the beach with food for a little girl of 2 years because you can t take carry out food from the restaurant, but if you call the room service they never send your food and they will charge you a fee for it.The Beach had no Bar and if you want a refresment drink only one employee serving for hundred of people on the beach. Practically no watersports equipment on the beach. The Better Place for Sodas And Drinks are in the pool bar, The Food was Great. Some Employees are excelent. The Pool is great and enormous.

<Content>Couldn't Ask For More!! My wife, teenage daughter, and I traveled to the Majestic Colonial mid June 2007. Of all of our vacations, this was the first time we really were not ready to go home at the end of our weeks stay. The resort was incredible, the pool was breathtaking, the room was clean and we did not have any problems with room service.As others had said, there is a little difficulty in communicating with the cleaning staff, but all of the bar tenders and waiters in the restaurants could easily converse in broker english.The food was excellent, even at the main buffet. We found the best service at the two beach side restaurants and the worst at the french restaurant. If you do not get into the french restaurant, you are not really missing anything, just go to the seafood restaurant at the beach and order the lobster.Upon checking in, you are given a wrist band that you have to wear for your entire stay. What you are not told is what the color of the wrist band means. Most American's are given a gray wristband, this indicates that you are entitled to the premium brands of alcohol at all of the bars. We did not find this out until our third day. With 8 bars, you are never more than 100 yards from a cold one.The beach was beautiful and there were always plenty of chairs. The pool went on forever and like the beach, we never had a problem finding chairs. We would go back in a heartbeat!

<Content>Extra Stiff Atmosphere! We stayed at this hotel during July 11th to 18th. Highly recomended but does not meet the expectations.The room was large and comfortable BUT toilette does not have a full door thus allowing natural odors to spread in the room. The room was not cleaned every day and the towels were changed only twice in 7 days. The food was average and the gurmet restaurants were a joke; sometimes have to make reservations two days in advance.We made reservation for 4 at the Japanese restaurant but got only 3 chairs. We had to give up our group reservation.Twice, we got 5 minutes late at the buffet restaurant (breakfast and lunch) and the staff did not allow us to eat although there were plenty of people inside. Once, we managed to sneek in but the staff rushed to take the plates from our table. We complained and got it is our policy as an answer.At the bar a 2 $ tip would give you regular water down drink but a 5$ tip would give a full alchool one.The pool is good for children but not deep enough for adults. The beach was ok but a lot of rocks in the water and not so clean like next door resorts.Someone from Grand Paradise (the next door resort) came to visit majestic, for a wedding reservation, but the guards harrased the lady because she did not have the great bracelet.We noticed some other examples of policy self antiadvertising.Can't blame the workers, they just follow the stiff rules and try to keep their job. If you want to relax, go somewhere else!

<Content>Worth the trip! I just returned home from the Majestic Colonial july22, 2007 and loved everyday of it !!!!!!! The weather was overcast but that didnt stop any of the guests from going on the beach or to the pool, and we still worked on our tans !!!!!! You must wear sunblock at all times the sun is very strong.We had a few sunny days and were thankful for the overcast days because we spent more time out to enjoy the beach and pool .The food is good and the selection was great. I did not travel to punta cana for the food , i went for the beauty of it. Some of the food is not what my family liked but we all have different palates. The dress code is neat and casual, you MUST wear long pants [ men] in the french restaurant and japanese. You can wear jeans as your long pants though. No tank tops anytime at dinner for the men. Ladies can wear most anything. It is hot so dont wear long sleeves. The rooms are beautiful but if you are traveling as a family in one room it can be hard because the shower is right in the bedroom with no privacy for changing. If you are getting a garden view room make sure you dont get the rooms facing the roof of the grand paradise resort, it is not a pretty view, we faced the pool and it was perfect. The staff is wonderful and will do whatever it takes to make you happy. I know tips are included but we tipped anyway . These workers are poor and yet so happy.The pool is the most beautiful ever,the shows were great and the beach by the majestic is the largest seating area compared to the other hotels. There are topless ladies all over on the beach. Overall the majestic is so far the best resort ive ever been to. Yes there is a language barrier but you cant expect the workers to learn every language of every guest !!!!!! There were no bugs. Just remember to pack all of your own toiletries, medicines etc.... it is so $$$$$$ to purchase that stuff there. enjoy your trip i know you will love it like we did !!!!!

<Content>disappointing Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor when I was planning my trip to Majestic Colonial, Punta Cana, I was really looking forward to my vacation there. Unfortunately I was very disappointed.The concierge staff was very matter of fact and the staff of the hotel was not friendly. The rooms were very spacious but you have no privacy at all because the bathrooms are wide open (NO WALL OR DOORS) and if you should want to get up in the middle of the night you will wake everyone in your room. The toilet bowl is in an enclosed area 2 feet by 3 feet (this is not an exageration), a big person will have great difficulty manuvering. The refrigerator in the room did not refrigerate any thing. After a rain storm we had a leak in the room. They claim to have seven restaurants but what they really have are three restaurants and two huge buffet restaurants all severely understaffed. The food however is the same where ever you go and is mediocre. My all family got food poisoning and we spent the last three days of our vacation throwing up. A bottle of sun tan lotion is $28.00. 75% of the people who go to the theatre can not see the stage; if you want a decent seat you must get there one hour before the show and since the shows are very amaturish, it is not worth the time invested. We decided to take a Safari Tour with a company called TURINTER; it was a total rip off and at one point we were attacked by some haitian sugar plantation workers brandishing machetes and demanding tips. The tour guide never intervened to protect the members of his group. If you are going with children there is a $70,00 a day fee for each child to enter the childrens park. Although the beach was ok. (nothing spectacular) I would have enjoied it more if I din't have to explain to my children why a number of women were topless. We should have been warned about that.

<Content>Great time at Majestic My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Majestic Colonial for five days (July 13 - 18) and had a fabulous time. Everything was great:* The food - Loved the restaurants that had buffet style dining.* The beach - You could take part in one of the many beach activities, walk along the shore, or simply relax on the beach for the day. Not to mention, the view was absolutely beautiful. * The bars - Make sure you meet Ernesto at the swim up bar; He makes some of the best drinks at the resort.* The rooms - Although the air conditioning unit was annoying at times (it operates on motion detectors, so it would constantly click on and off), our room was very spacious and well maintained (housekeeping did a great job cleaning it daily).* The entertainment - Great shows; Also, the entertainment team went out of their way to ensure all guests were having a great time. Samuel, Taison, Jesus, Maria, Rey, and Julio thank you for making the trip more enjoyable.I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again for future trips to the Dominican Republic.Tanya

<Content>Had higher expectaions, but OK trip My boyfriend and I visited the Majestic Colonial from July 6-July 13, 2007. Overall, it was a good trip, but I think all the reviews are a little exaggerated and slightly misleading about how great this place its. Neither one of us had ever been to an all-inclusive resort before, nor had we ever been to the Dominican Republic. I must say, first of all, that the resort/beach is BEAUTIFUL--we loved the location, the resort grounds, etc--we had perfect, blue sky weather everyday (got really lucky on this) and for the most part, thought the room was very nice (we upgraded to the direct pool access room which I would highly recommend--it was very convenient to be able to walk out your door to the pool). There was a slight bug issue in the room (lots of small, ant-like bugs on the furniture (especially desk and nightstands), but I guess what can you expect--it is a tropical climate, etc. I would strongly advise reading as much as you can about the resort/what it has to offer/etc, because the rooms have NO guides/information about the resort (ie-no info about the restaurants/hours of operation/menus, etc/no instructions on how to use the phones even...this was fairly frustrating, but thankfully I had done a lot of research prior to coming and knew, somewhat, what to expect. We did have some issues with the phone that were frustrating...I had purchased an international calling card (which i do not recommend) prior to leaving home and intended on using this rather than our cell phones (which did work, but cost 2.00/min to use while there). There is a 2.00 connection fee anytime you use the hotel phone and you have to dial 0 to get the operator to dial the number for you. I tried 3 times to get the calling card to work, it never did, and was told that we wouldn't be charged as no call was actually made--we ended up just using our cell phones--upon check out, we were charged and told that it didn't matter what we had been told and had to pay for these calls--this was frustrating--we also spoke with others at the resort that said their calling cards would not work either--not sure what the problem was. My biggest complaint was the FOOD--in my opinion it was TERRIBLE--I am a slightly picky eater, but my boyfriend is not at all and we both had a lot of trouble finding things that tasted OK. There is certainly no lack of selection, everythinig just tasted strange and was very greasy--especially the breakfast. My best recommendation would be the French Restaurant, Le Gourmet--we ate there twice and I got the Pumpkin Cream soup and surf and turf both times and this was my favorite meal by far!! I was very disappointed w/ the Japanese Steakhouse Matsuri and the buffett--the beach steakhouse was OK, but definitely not good. I would STRONGLY recommend bringing snacks--towards the end of the trip, I couldn't take the food anymore and bought a small/med bag of Doritos from the gift shop that cost 7.00!! I ate that for 2 meals!! I would also STRONGLY recommend bring pepto bismol--we used all 24 tablets of ours--we didn't drink the tap water and never got sick, but had upset stomachs several days and assume the food had a lot to do with it. As far as activities go, I did the pool-water aerobics almost everyday--would recommend, and we took the Isla Saona trip, a little long, but would also recommend (we were gone from 6:30am till 7:30 pm and it cost approx 85.00/ea)--it's really interesting to drive through the cities and the Island is beautiful. Overall, we had a good time, probably wouldn't return, but if we did would definitely plan no more than a 5 day stay--8 was a little too much.

<Content>Great vacation!!! We stayed for two weeks at the Colonial Majestic. Everything was great. Great service, the food was very variated and the drinks were very good.We fully enjoyed two weeks at the wonderful resort.Especially the service from Danny the pool concierge was great. He managed to provide the guest with drinks and clean towels at the pool during the hot day. This is a great service and it would be great to have this service at the beach as well!We will definately return to this hotel!Marcel  Kim (Holland)

<Content>perfect I have NO COMPLAINTS!!! We picked this place for our company 4th of July Trip alot because of Trip Advisor and everything was wonderful!!! The only problem I had was of my own fault when I forgot and left the room voucher from my tour company back home in Texas. This meant my stress level was at a max. upon arrival at the hotel. (esp because it was for my sons rooms) The staff at Majestic was terrffic and handled the problem quickly and with ease, getting my sons in there room along with the 23 other people to there rooms within a matter of minutes. Also by letting my know to relax...your on vacation I know that people can find fault in any place if they try hard enough because that is human nature but they would have to really try hard to find fault at the Majestic! In my opinion if you are looking for a wonderful resort with a beautiful beach Majestic Colonial IS WORTH A TRY!!!!PS We used cheapcarribean.com and they are a company I plan on dealing with from now on!!!!!!!! Thanks Diane for all your help and thanks Noel for all they help at the resort

<Content>Can't Wait To Go Back!!!! I just got back yesterday from Punta Cana, and I'm already missing myvacation!! I was with a group of 10 people (we're all in our 20s) and we all loved our stay at the Majestic. We had had a long day of travel, but arrived to the resort to smiling faces and complimentary cocktails atcheck-in and cool towels. We were all escorted or driven to our 5 separate rooms and our baggage was carried or delivered shortly afterus. The resort itself is beautiful - the pool, beach side, and all of thefacilities. Our hardest decision during the vacation was whether to start off at the pool or beach. Both were always very clean. We neverhad a problem getting chairs at the beach or the pool (even with all 10 of us). We had 5 rooms and all of them were great - very clean and well-maintained. They were the most basic rooms you can get there (of all the types of suites they have), but still one of the best rooms I've ever stayed in (and there have been a lot!) The shower was HUGE and the hot tub was always decorated with fresh flowers. I'm not sure what other people are writing about cracks and wear in the rooms - all 5 of ours were perfect!! We did find that we loved the buffet for breakfast and lunch, but not so much for dinner - definitely take advantage of the other restaurants they have there. Also, if you are planning to eat a late lunch (3-4pm) avoid the Steak/Seafood buffet area as they kicked us one afternoon to start setting up for dinner. We really loved the Mexican, Steak/Seafood and French restaurants (wewould have gone twice to the French if we could have made more reservations!) But yes, as a lot of other reviews have said, make reservations for the restaurant as soon as you get there. Our last night and best experience was with the hibatchi steak restaurant (Japanese). The shows were just okay - we saw the Michael Jackson and Circ de Soleil like ones and enjoyed them. We spent some nights in the discoteca where there is lots of dancing - salsa, meringue, hip hop, something for everyone. Definitely tip! You will be amazed at the excellent service you get at the bars and restaurants and it will definitely be remembered. We tipped when we first got there (and throughout the trip) and never had any trouble. The service was EXCELLENT! One thing that happened 3-4 times during our week stay is that the power went out. This was actually amusing because it always happened at night so we made the best of it. It was only out for about 5-10 minutes but the air conditioning in the rooms had to be turned back on manually so the first time it happened, our room was very hot whenwe returned. Just something to be aware of. One of the couples in our group did an excursion around the island (Jurassic Safari, I think it was called) where they went to see a sugarcane field, coffee factory, a cave and had a typical Dominican meal. They raved about it! You can make reservations to do things like this in the lobby. Half of our group got deep muscle massages at the spa and they were amazing! Very affordable and the women were all very professional. A great way to end our trip! Everyone on staff is very attentive and polite. We had nothing but excellent experiences with all of the employees and other travelers! I would definitely recommend this facility to all ages - there were lots of families, couples, and travelers of all ages. It was also very affordable going off season - We had a great time!

<Content>Great resort, but NOT for singles The Majestic Colonial is a clean, beautiful, well run resort. Many of the typical complaints about Dominican Hotels don't apply here. The service and food were both above average. Ants/bugs were controlled well. The pools were clean and well maintained, as well as the beach and sand. This is a great place to go with a significant other or a group or your family. This is NOT a great place to go if you want to meet other singles. In a full resort, we (4 single straight men) were the only single men there! With 600 rooms, you would think there might be a handful of single women. Nope. We made and found our own fun off resort, but it was a pain in the [--]. The staff was super, but we became the running joke of the staff by the 3rd night of our trip. It was just awkward to see 4 guys trolling the grounds in a sea of families and couples. NOT FUN.I can't really blame the resort for this. They have to cater to their clientele. But, we obviously weren't it!Dollar tips will go a long way. If you regularly tip your staff, they will remember you and go out of their way to serve you and make sure your glass is always full!

<Content>Beautiful Majestic Just returned from the Majestic Colonial stayed from July 11-18th. The Majestic is a beautiful resort. On arriving you are greeted with cold towels and drinks. The lobby is breathtaking. Now the rooms, the room is beautiful but privacy is an issue. I didn't quite get it from the other reviewers when the talked about this issue. The problem is there is no dressing area that is closed in, you have to get dressed in the small toilet area or the shower stall. I dealt with it but at times it was annoying. Maid service was wonderful, the room was always cleaned and restocked. The beach and the pool are breathtaking. Bring plenty of sunscreen the sun is very hot and humid. The staff were wonderful from bartenders to servers to gardeners. The entire staff is very friendly and courteous, yes dollar bills help alot. We were always taken care of. Food- The food was ok some food better than others. We live in New York so maybe we are a little critical. Breakfast buffet has something for everyone large variety of different foods. Lunch was a little disappointing not large selection of food and the same thing everyday.Dinners were good some better than others. The Japanese is really good (make resevations as soon as you get there) We did not really care for the French, except for the Pumpkin soup that was really good. The International Buffet was terrible, but the Steakhouse and Seafood restaurant were very good, as was the Mexican restaurant.Animation Team- wonderful crew they try to get everyone involved in different activities. Hands up to this team they work long hours everyday and they will make your trip wonderful.The Michael Jackson show is wonderful very entertaining. The circuqe show is very good also. They need to have some better entertainment at night than these two shows. The disco is small as is the casino. This resort is more for families than singles. My son is 20 and there was not much for them to do at night except go to the disco.The spa is wonderful I has a full body massage and facial, very relaxing and well worth the money.Overall the Majestic was wonderful. We will definetely go back.

<Content>Paradise My daughter, husband, two children and I had the greatest time of our life, The rooms, service, restaurants, pool, beach, shows, casino, activities at the pool and beach could not have been better,I sent all my friends emails from the hotel and told them that their next vacation had to be a must here.We had the opportunity of meeting the owners. There is a chapel at the grounds and there we met the owners. Wonderful people.As soon as we got back we checked with the agency to book for Thanksgiving.The tour people that they have at the Hotel were also very nice with us.I recommend this hotel to all my friends. I spent there the best 8 days of my life.

<Content>Well worth the money Let me say that this is my third time in the DR. We stayed at Casa de Campo 7 years ago which is my favorite. Paradisus Palma Royal(Royal Service) in March 2007 and Majestic Colonial July 5th - July 12th. THE GOOD--Our Rooms- were 2119,2120,2121. They were situated right by the pool ground level. The rooms were clean and were cleaned every day in a timely manner. Pool - Clean big and beautiful and ran the length of the resort right by our rooms. We went to the pool every day about 4:30 it was great. Beach - We stayed at 3 beaches in the DR the Majestics' was the cleanest the best sand and the water was the best. I was concerned about the water for people said it was rough. To us it had movement but was calm and clean and not rocky at all. We sat on the beach to the right of the restaurant. No problem getting chairs and huts on the beach. We stayed on the beach most of the day and ate lunch at the beach restaurant every day. It was convenient and fine. Service People - Always helpful and enjoyed teaching us new Spanish words we had no problem communicating. The BAD - It was not only my room that had a weird smell but all the people we asked had the same problem. We bought sented candles at the Spa and it made it much better. Within a few days it went away or we got used to it. Buy your scented candles at home and bring them with you. In GENERAL - Don't go to the DR expecting great food(Only Casa de Campo) because it's just not. It's ok- Breakfast at the buffet and lunch at the beach was fine. (You can find something) Dinner we had a good experience at the Steak restaurant we ate there twice and the French we found good. We paid $1500 a person including air. We all decided that for what we paid the Majestic Colonial is a wonderful resort.

<Content>Just Another Day in Paradise! Five nights at the Majestic were just not enough! After relying so heavily on Trip Advisor to help choose a resort, I wanted to give our opinion. Many others have gone into great and helpful detail, so I'll try to limit my comments.Folks have noted the beds are firm. That's an understatement. Hard is more like it. It took 2 nights to adjust. But adjust we did. As we also adjusted to flat pillows and sheets with little pills. It's a reality of travel that everything is not going to be like it is at home. Sometimes that's good. Because what we don't have at home is a gorgeous beach with lounge chairs, tiki hut umbrellas, palm trees with soft breezes and clear clean water. Enjoy! Enjoy the huge, beautiful clean pool for all its different possibilites. The active side, the peaceful side, the hot tub and it's partner with almost ice water. Enjoy the antimation team. They work hard to include everyone in the good time. The entire staff is very agreeable. Even the ones who don't understand a word you are saying. I never heard a negative comment about any staff member except in the Casino..(What's up with that?)The scenery is magnificant. Take lots of pictures, but also seekout the excellent professional protographer who will make your friends and family look great. And why nit-pic the food? There is a great variety and many options to choose from. We enjoyed the Sushi in the Japanese area, the French, the Steaks, the Seafood, and the regular buffet. You can always find something good! At many all-inclusive resorts you are limited to one or two special restaurants and must eat most meals at the buffet. That's not true here and my family appreciated that. Alcoholic drinks were not watered down as you will find in many all-inclusive resorts. If anything - you must ask for a bit more mixer if you want to stay upright!.For folks needing more privacy in the bathroom - I suggest bringing some duct tape to tape a sheet over the opening between the bedroom and bath. Bring plenty of reading material. That is expensive at the Majestic. A newspaper was over $10. US cable channels are plentiful. That was great to watch movies or the news in English.Another tip. Go to Guest Services on your first day. Ask for a map and any helpful information they wish to give. It will save some aimless wandering. If you want to take a helicoper ride or go on another excursion, book early in your stay. We waited too late to be able to get into some of these.This may not be the nicest resort we''ve ever visited. The Melia Paradisus hotels are more luxurious, but also more expensive.. Tthis resort is beautiful, a great value for the money and lots of fun. I would highly recommend it to anyone. You can't go wrong. You'll get a lot for the money.

<Content>Great Place Didn't want to leave Just got back from the Majestic Colonial. We stayed from July 6th thru July 13th. Our party consisted of 5 people. My husband, two grown children, ages 20 and 24, my brother in law and myself. We had a great time. The weather was great, with a little rain a couple days, but it only lasted 10 minutes and was done. A little back ground...this is the second time my husband and I have been to the DR, so we kinda knew what to expect. We booked thru CheapCaribbean and air flight with Delta, leaving Detroit to Atlanta, then to Punta Cana and had no trouble. Once we landed at Punta Cana airport, bought our $10.00 entrance card made it thru customs, got our luggage and found transportation to the resort, which was Turinter Tours, we were at Majestic Colonial within 35-40 minutes. The ride from the Punta Cana airport to Majestic Colonial is an adventure in itself. The way the people drive is something in itself. Quite amusing. Just sit back, hold on and enjoy the ride.We checked in without any problems, got to our rooms and changed into our suits and headed to the beach. It's a beautiful beach and the water is clear blue and clean. Each morning we would be at the beach by 9:00 -9:30 and had no problem getting front row palapa's. As you walk to the beach to the left (I think west) you can see mountains which are simply spectacular. And to the east all the way down the beach you can see the merchants tents. More on the merchants later.... The beach bar was the place to get a great drink from Flelix. What a great smile. I told him is was famous on trip advisor and he said he knew that. All the bartenders at the beach bar were very friendly. Everyday we would snorkle. Make sure you take some bread with you and an underwater disposable camera and the fish will find you. Our rooms were 2238 and 2237. Facing the pool. Right where the animation teams perform. Something that may help you out is room number...the first 2 is building #, second 2 is floor number, third and fourth # is room number. We could see the beach and watch the entertainment if we wanted to.The rooms were very clean and did not smell musty. The bathroom situation was a little odd, but we adapted well. We were on vacation and were only in the room to sleep basically. The shower is huge and great pressure. The toilet is a little cramped but not an issue. The housekeeping was excellent. Clean room and towels everyday. We tipped them a couple dollars everyday, and I think they appreciate it. Anytime we would see them walking by, they would smile and say holaThe pool was magnificient. We called it the never ending pool. IT starts by the main lobby and ends by the beach. Like other trip advisors write, you could find a quiet spot to float or participate in the activities by the swim up bar. Very nice.Our food was good. Something for everyone. Some people have written in and said the food just so so, but were were impressed with the Japaneese, Gourmet, and breakfast buffet. The Japaneese was very entertaining and a good time and great food.. The Gourmet food was great. Please try the pumpkin soup, and the beef wellington. WOW!!! Our breakfast each morning consisted of fresh squeezed orange juice or mamosa, omlets, potatos, bacon, sausages, waffles, french toast, fresh fruit...I could go on. We would eat lunch at the beach buffet. Salads, fruits, fresh pasta, hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, fish, palea. You could eat at the beach buffet in your swim suits. Men, remember you must wear a shirt, but us ladies can go in our swim suits with wraps or covers. One day we went off the beach and changed into dry clothes and went up to lunch at the main buffet. To be quite honest it's the same thing at the beach buffet only you have to be in dry clothes. So we decided it wasn't worth it to go up to the main buffet for lunch. All and all the same food. We also ate dinner at the steakhouse and at the seafood restaurant. Same building only one side you order seafood and the other side you order steak, sausage, etc... Almost all the restaurants are air conditioned except the steakhouse, seafood restaurant, and lunch buffet. (Same building) It is open air concept. But with the breeze coming off the beach it was really no problem.My daughter and my brother in law had made a pack that each day they would try something new and different to eat. Needless to say, I did not participate in this adventure. It was quite fun watching them try new food and then watch the facial expressions. On two different days, went to the water taxi east of the resort (to the right of the resort when you face the ocean) There were two men with a boat and they would take you anywhere you wanted to go. Bargain with them. We paid $20 dollars for 4 of us for them to take us to and from the merchants tent which is about 2 miles down the beach.We just told them where we wanted to go and what time to pick us up. When we were done shopping they were there waiting for us. No problem. Quite an experience at the merchants tent. They are so friendly and try to sell you something. As we got off the water taxi they were right there to greet us. My husband and I have been through this before and as long as you don't let the touchy - feely, close talking get to you then you are fine. Everything was cheappy, cheappy, 99% off. Better sales than at Wal-Mart. (heard these phrases alot.) I bet we spent $250.00 buying paintings, jewerly, statures, and t-shirts. I wanted my grown children to experience this and they both had a blast. By the end of our shopping experience they had come out of the merchants tent loaded with bags of goodies. And great memoriesAbout Wedensday, my daughter and I craved some American munchies...we went to the Mini market at the resort and bought a $2.00 Milky Way and a $5.00 stack of pringles. UNBELIEVABLE. The checkout lady must have seen the look on our face and asked how much this would have cost us in USA and we told her and then she had the same look we did. But the $7.00 we spent was worth it. Believe me that Milky Way never tasted so good.Check out was a breeze. You have to be out of you room by 12:00noon. A CheapCaribbean rep was there and we got on the right bus, and headed back to the Punta Cana Airport. No problem thru customs, and immigrations. The flight back to Atlanta went very smooth. We even got bact to Atlanta 30 minutes early. Last year when I wrote about our adventures, coming home thru Atlanta was a disaster. So landing in Atlanta again was something I wasn't looking forward to. However, it went very smooth. The customs and immigrations people were wonderful. I guess last year must have been a bad day. We were welcomed back home with warm greetings and smiles. (Unlike last year) Really only one bad situation...It has been 20 hours since we flew into Detroit Metro and we still do not have our luggage. But we got a phone call a little bit ago and everything is being delivered yet today. And we are 90 minutes from Detroit. When we realized that some of our luggage was not in Detrout we had to go and file a claim with Delta Airlines and describe our lost luggage. (5 bags) I asked what had happened. The Delta rep said that Atlanta customs are so overwelmed and they want to thourghly check every bag. Sometimes the luggage doesn't make the flight. I was fine with that. However my husband wasn't. But I feel they are doing the best they can considering the world we live in today. Delta airlines have always been good to us and I know they will do everything possible to help us out.In closing (sorry this is so long) just some suggestions: * Remember you are in someone elses country. Try to respect  enjoy their heritage and their lifestyle. * Try some new food each, you never know you may like it * Tip the Dominican workers. they are warm, wonderful, happy people and they work for very little. *SUNSCREEN, SUNSCREEN,SUNSCREEN *Go to the merchants tent. A great experience. Buy something from them. It's cheapy, cheapy.Thank you Majestic Colonial. We had a wonderful time and made new family memories that will last a lifetime. We can't wait to come back.

<Content>best resort i have been to This was probably the best resort I have ever been to. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The service is amazing, everyone was very friendly and sweet. They make you feel very comfortable there. The food and drinks were great. There is a huge variety of food to choose from. The rooms are HUGE and very clean. The entertainment staff is the best I have seen. They get everyone involved in the activities and work so hard all day. I would suggest this resort to anyone who is going to Punta Cana, and am planning on returning myself.

<Content>Majestic is Majestico!!! This is my second time to the Majestic, but this time we were 26 people, ranging from 10 to 72 years old. As usual the Majestic Staff went completely out of there way to please my whole family. You can't get bored in this 5 star resort. The key element of this resort is the Entertainment Staff led by Ralph and it's members, Nelson, Rey, Pablo,Kelly, Andres, Isidro, Samuel, Alexandra, Sandy, Jesus (El Jefe de Animacion), Julio, Jackeline and Maria. They will keep you charge All the time you are there with their Taki, Taki dance and their games. My teenagers were amazed with everything in the resort. The entire staff is geared towards quality customer service and will make sure that your stay is numero uno! I will definitely go back to the Majestic.

<Content>Great Honeymoon My wife and I just came back from our honeymoon at the Majestic Colonial. The hotel was amazing. We were given an oceanfront colonialjunior suite and words could not explain how nice the room was. The terrace/balcony was about 25 feet long and had a great view of the ocean and a jacuzzi on it. The AC worked very well, the bed was very comfy and our room was cleaned/minibar restocked everyday. The beach was beautiful and not as crowded as some of the resorts that are further down the beach. The pool was the best I鈥檝e ever seen and as other reviews mention you could always find a place where there was action or where you could be alone - that goes for anywhere on the resort. Food was very good as well. We enjoyed all the restaurants and there was a nice variety at the buffet. Only drawback was that wefelt the service was a bit rushed at the Steak, Seafood and Mexican restuarants. But overall service was great at the restaurants and thebars and everyone understood english. The management and workers werevery nice and granted any special requests we had. The Majestic seemed to offer a great all aound package for everyone. Nice beach, good service, nice rooms, nice pool and not too far from the airport and excursions. The animation shows were hit or miss for us. We liked the performance shows more than the audience participation ones. But the animation team works very hard to keep the place fun for those who like to participate in activities throughout the day. Excursions: We took the carribean festival tour which was $78pp. It was nice, some snorkeling, swim in shark and sting ray pen, drinks and snacks and some dance performances. Only con was the ride there which took about an hour because we had to stop at several hotels on the way. The ride back was only 30 mins.Dunno if I would call it an excursion but also rented a speedboat at the majestic. $70 for 2 people for one hour. Highly rccommended! Had the time of my life driving it, and you鈥檙e taken on a nice, speedy tour up and down the coast.

<Content>Doesn't live up to the hype I was more than a bit disappointed with some aspects of the Majestic Colonial. The good--the beach was beautiful and huts were always available and the entire staff was helpful, friendly and accommodating. The bad...there was no information on anything at all in the room. It would have been helpful to know the dress code for the restaurants and what type of restaurants there were. I didn't know there was an italian restaurant until I got home. We were alwaysdressed wrong for every restaurant and had to go back to the room to change. Food was ok, nothing more. Breakfast and lunch buffets were boring...same thing every day. No room service, no washclothes, no tissues, no bathrobes, nothing to put in the jacuzzi tub, mini bar was only stocked with two beers and a couple of sodas, pillows were awful, beds were not much better and towels were like sandpaper. The ugly...Ripped, dirty slip cover on couch in room. All the cushions inthe lobby were so stained and filthy I would not sit on them. Not at all worth the price.

<Content>Loved Majestic Colonial! Majestic Colonial was a very nice stay. The food was great and the people were friendly and very hospitable. The rooms, grounds, and restuarants were very clean and that is a must for me. I had a very good time and there is plenty to do. I would highly recommend it and I will visit it again next year.

<Content>Avoid The Japanese Restaurant Overall, I was very pleased with the resort. We stayed in the Junior Standard room, which is the most basic available, but it suited our needs. The first room we were given had two double beds, but we were able to switch to a room with a single king, which I found to be very stiff and pretty uncomfortable. The A/C in our room didn't keep it very cold, but the ceiling fan did help a little bit. I liked the roomy shower; however, it came at the expense of the toilet area. There is very little room in the toilet (and I'm average sized) and I kept knocking the phone off the hook. Why there is a phone in there to begin with is a question I have yet to answer. There was a small college boy fridge in the room, although it did not keep things cold at all. I was surprised to find the TV got several US stations (including ESPN), although the satellite did go out on occasion, especially when it rained.Overall the food was pretty good, although I did get tired of it after about the 4th day. At the buffets, I found that most of the food that should have been hot was on the cold side, and most of the cold food was lukewarm. I would recommend eating at the different restaurants to experience some variety. However, I would recommend avoiding the Japanese hibachi restaurant entirely. I cannot stress this enough. Someone needs to put a tent over that circus. If you're idea of a good time is being trapped in a room with people screaming in a language you can't understand and whistling at ear splitting volumes for two hours, then by all means go for it. This, however, is not my idea of a good time, and thus I was about one more whistle away from turning into Jack Nicholson during the last half hour of The Shining. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed the French restaurant tremendously, and also liked the Steakhouse and the Mexican restaurant. The Seafood place was OK, but the lobster was awful. There is a Chinese restaurant that is not part of the Japanese section and doesn't require reservations, unfortunately, we didn't know about that until our last night.The pool is by far the highlight of the resort. It has something for everyone. We mostly stayed in the quiet end, which was near the front of the resort. However, there were louder and fun areas as you traveled down to the beach. There were also some Jacuzzi areas and a swim up wet bar. The pool had several ledge areas, which held about 6 inches of water, in which you could lay down in or pull a deck chair into. It made for a nice relaxing time. The water temperature was perfect.One caveat...if you plan on playing a lot of tennis during your vacation, this is not the place for you. There are 3 courts, none of which are playable. They have something they call a clay court, but where I'm from we call it a gravel pit. It was just a lined plot of gravel with huge rocks. One of the 2 hard courts looked decent, but unfortunately the net was lying in a ball off to the side. The other hard court had big sections of gravel and dirt. We raised the issue to the front desk, and the next day they sent us a note saying the courts were repaired. We went to check it out and found that they had run a few lines of green paint on the court with no net. So much for tennis.The resort had a gym, and I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of equipment, because I expected nothing. They had a small selection of free weights (dumbbells and bars) and some weight machines, as well as some cardio equipment. It's by no means a health club like we have in the states, but it gets the job done for a week. Although I think the guy who worked there was trying to make a play on my girlfriend all week.The beach area was very well kept, spacious, and never crowded. We walked past several other resorts and it looked like a tornado had blown through, with people and stuff everywhere. All in all, I was very pleased with the resort. Nothing was ever crowded, the staff was very pleasant, and there was plenty to do. Just please, please stay out of the Japanese restaurant.

<Content>Everything and More! The Majestic Colonial is immaculate! It takes 30 minutes from the airport. When we arrived we were greeted with cold facecloths and a frozen drink called the Majestic. The lobby area and rooms look exactly like the website photos. Nothing is tired or run down looking at all. The service is very good. The meals were good as well. Breakfast and lunch are more of a buffet style. Breakfast has an egg station and crepe/waffle station manned with a chef. Everything under the sun is offered and fresh!Lunch has some pasta, pizza , and burger stations manned with chefs, along with fresh fruit and salads. The beach is beautiful and there is always a breeze there. The pool is not as breezy but very nice with ample space and a swim up bar. There is no rush for towels or shade...plenty for all. We didn't experience any bugs unless it rains. The service was very good. The workers speak little English but do everything in their power to understand and accomodate you. I think Americans are given gray bands to wear on their wrists while spanish speaking people are given white bands. I'm not sure if this is for the staff for commincation reasons. The spa is very nice as well. The grounds are meticulous! One thing I would reccommend is to bring school supplies for the children. Each day I left notepads and pencils for the maid as a tip along with a couple of dollars and we had the same maid everyday cleaning our room. WE had swans made from towels and beautiful flowers throughout the room. I didn't expect this but I think it was her way of thanking us. I would go back in a heart beat. This all inclusive is a great family get away.

<Content>Loved the Majestic!!!! I stayed at the majestic from june 29-july 4th. First of all i want to say that some people do not do this hotel justice. First off, there is nothing wrong with the A/c in rooms... maybe some people are alittle slow in understanding it. The Hotel is georgeous. The Grounds are very well kept, and the pool is HUGE and CLEAN. The Breakfast buffet is outstanding. Make sure to get there before 10:30a but AFTER 7:30a. Therefore all the food is out by then so u have a chance to sample everything. There is alot of food, something for everyone. There are many excursions to purchase, but also if you are into fishing, DON'T book through the independent vendors on the beach, make sure to book inside the hotel with those tour operators. We booked on the beach and went deep sea fishing.. $85 p/p and i never even HELD a fishing rod.. there explanation was the fish was not biting.I recomend the ATV tour if u like driving it is very much worth it, and the people really make it safe for everyone. The drinks at majestic are really good, the staff is very helpful and the shows they put on at night are very good. The disco is so so, if you are really into partying then you might be expecting more, but still not a driving reason not to stay here. The hotel makes up for it. Also the spa is beautiful. I got an aroma massage and was in heaven. Everything is well kept, and i wish i had the time to get another one.In short I recomend Majestic for everyone! The rooms are clean, although the maid comes very early, so sometimes you will have to call the front desk so the maid can come back to your room, if you are in there when she comes the first time. The shower is huge, but yes the bathroom area is alittle open, so make sure you are comfortable with the person you are going with since privacy is limited. But i did find out that, that is not a majestic practice, but alot of hotel in D.R. I am already looking to plan my next trip there, and will be staying at the majestic. Any questions you can contact me @ Im2Good2BTRUE21@aol.com

<Content>Great Place For the Money Let me preface this by saying this our third ai resort. We have stayed at Sandals Whitehouse, Sandals Montego Bay and now the Majestic.If I had to compare them it would be:Sandals WH: Ritz CarltonMajestic: MarriotSandals MB: Super 8Room:The Majestic is beautiful! We had a great room 2340. We were directly in front of the pool and bar and could see the ocean from the side. We didn't have any problem with the bathroom, but I could see if you had teenage children it might be difficult. The only down side was the mattress. It was rock hard! Lots of pillows and the maids did a great job. I read that people had a tough time getting washcloths, so I bought some from Walmart and used only two.Pool: Amazing! Went on forever. You could have a quiet spot or be in the thick of things. The pool bar was great too. Bianca and Albert made great drinks and were always smiling. We did tip them everday, but they make so little money. It was well worth it.Food: It was good. You could always fine something you liked. We tried every restaurant, but the Chinese was our favorite. And I'm not sure why, but twice while we were there someone brought us a botttle of white wine and sushi and another night a dessert plate and a bottle of red wine. We didn't hear of anyone getting sick, but met plenty of people at the airport from different resorrts who did. One girl on her honeymoon ended up in the hospital. It cost her $3000. They wouldn't let her leave until she paid. They wouldn't take any kind of insurance includind trip insurance, so bring a credit card just in case.I think for the price you pay ($950 pp 5 nights out of Boston on US air) it is well worth it. We did bring about $300 dollars and spent most of it on tipping and about a $100 at the casino. We'd go back!

<Content>An amazing vacation from reality! First, let me say that I feel absolutely compelled to write this review. I stalked Tripadvisor for months trying to decide where to stay on this vacation, reading reviews and reading the forums. Therefore, I would like to share my experience with others and try to share some things that haven't already been shared....although I think that may be hard to do!My hubby and I had gone alone to the Riviera Maya in November 2006. We stayed at the Iberostar Maya (free upgrade from the Lindo) and we were extremely impressed. We were afraid we would be disappointed with the Majestic, as we had high expectations after this trip. But we were not!As a background, I went on this vacation with my husband, my 10-year old daughter and my in-laws. We booked through Cheap Caribbean and received a fantastic deal. We were there from June 1 - 6, although I wish we could have stayed longer! We were looking for a relaxing vacation as the past few months were quite tough for our family. I believe we found exactly what we needed.Unfortunately, the flight from Chicago was a bit of a pain. There was not a direct flight from Chicago, so we flew in through Puerto Rico and flew home through Miami. Long days of travel, but well worth it. Hopefully airlines will realize what a great destination Punta Cana is and will offer more direct flights through major carriers.Upon arrival at the hotel at about 4 PM, after traveling since 5 AM, we were greeted with cool, scented towels and a Majestic. At that point we were hooked on the Majestics!!! I had tried to confirm my reservation a few days before but I believe the Majestic's internet was down, and I never received confirmation. We were a bit nervous, especially since we had been through hell and back with our passports, as we traveled the week before they changed the passport rules. Anyways, Victor, Oscar and Emily had certainly taken care of us, giving us a special check-in and beautiful rooms for both my family and my in-laws. I would strongly advise to make your reservations for the Japanese and Gourmet restaurants immediately. We had no problem getting reservations, but had we waited, I don't know if that would have been the case. Our rooms were absolutely gorgeous! I am not sure as to the room category, but we were on the 4th floor and had two room suites with the jacuzzi inside as well as one on our own private deck. We never had problems with the air conditioning, nor did we have and musty smell issues, as some guests had mentioned. The air in general had a Caribbean smell to it....which was not a bad thing! The beds were harder than the ones we have at home, but I had no problems sleeping at all and no back aches. We had a king size bed in one room and they put a twin sized bed in the other room for my daughter, thus giving us some privacy, which was really nice. Yes, the bathrooms are an odd set-up, but as we had two rooms, it wasn't an issue at all. We aren't too bothered by these things anyways. The shower was big enough to fit a bowling team.....very nice. Never had issues withwater temp as well. No problems with maid service....we left a few dollars every day, and they were clean apon our return. We didn't spend much time in the rooms during the day, as we were enjoying the sun. Our mini-bar was always restocked as well. Always had clean towels. At one point we had some ants, since my daughter sloppily ate some crackers. Housekeeping came very quickly ans sprayed, and even left the can with us. The ants were gone in a few minutes and never returned. OK, as for the pool, I believe everyone has said everything that needs to be said. It is magnificent!!! The water temp was perfect....not too warm, but definitely not cold. I am a baby when it comes to water temps, and I had no problems walking right in. the pools were always clean....which is surprising, due to all the empty cups that people leave lying around. We mostly stayed at the noisy end of the pool by the swim-up bar. We did water aerobicsevery day at noon....quite fun. We participated in many of the games and had a blast. We met a great group of people from KY, CT and Puerto Rico. It was very easy to socialize in this area. The animation team was great as well, although they were geared toward adult entertainment rather that with the babies or kids, as they called them. Regardless, my daughter did aerobics with me, and learned the Tacqui dance as well, and still does what she can remember when it plays on our ipods! You can definitely find quiet areas in the pool as it is so expansive. As for drinks, we mostly drank at the swim up bar. I believe Bianca was our main bartender, and she was very attentive. Of course, this became more difficult at times when it was more crowded, but what can you expect! My daughter must have had at least 30 non-alcoholic Majestics...yummy! My hubby loved the Pressidente, and the guys would often order them by the tray!! We tried shots of Mamajuana.....very tasty, and if you can't catch a buzz, try some of these!! I mostly had alcoholic Majestics, Miami Vices, and I would request Stoli and cranberry. No problems with alcohol content. I would suggest to bring an insulated cup....I had read this, but didn't get a chance to buy them, and I wish I had! The ice does melt fast...duh!The beach was gorgeous, of course. The water was clear, and the waves were too bad. There were a lot of topless women, as a lot of guests are European. We just tried not to look! We brought sand toysfrom home and built a castle. We didn't have any problems getting a palapa, but we usually went to the beach in the morning.As for food, I found it to be quite good overall. Remember to bring pants for the men if you want to go to the Gourmet. I accidently took my hubby's pants out of the luggage and we were not allowed into the Gourmet. We didn't have an issue with pants anywhere else. We ate at Taino, both the steak and seafood restaurants and the Japanese. All were very good. The buffets were great as well. Of course, I wasn't expecting downtown Chicago quality food, but we were not unhappy. I think the food at the Majestic was better than the Iberostar.A few other thoughts to end this monster of a review.....The layout and size of the hotel were great. It was much smaller than the Iberostar, yet had everything we needed. You could find your way easily, and everything was scenic. There is a Catholic chapel on the property, which has mass on Sunday at 11. We attended, and although most was in Spanish, you could follow along. We did not use the kids club for my daughter. She made a friend from Miami, and they would play in the pool while we were doing our own thing (always in our sight, though). There were not many kids there, especially since we went June 1 and most are still in school. While my daughter had a blast, kids that require a lot of activities may not be as satisfied. Again, we did not check out the kids club....although from afar it seemed to cater more to younger children.We unfortunately lost our digital camera the first day we were there. I must have but it down somewhere...no clue. So sadly we don'thave many memories, and this put a damper on my vacation! The last day I did buy a disposable for $25....yikes. The pics were just ok. They have photographers at the resort who take beautiful pictures, but they are also a bit pricey. I would suggest bringing a cheap disposable, just in case. My hubby did have some stomach problems while we were there, but when you eat a lot, drink a lot, and spend the entire day in the sun, what do you expect! We brought any medicine that you can think of from home....tums, heartburn meds, pepto bismal, advil, etc. I would suggest to do the same. Bring a lot of sunscreen! We brought the spray, and it seems to go a lot quicker than the lotion. The sun really is hot down there, so be careful! Bring some aloe as well, for nighttime in case you burn.I heard people had problems with the ATM, so be sure to bring enough cash. We brought at least $100 in singles, and my in-laws brought a lot as well. We always tipped, as the people are so hard-working. Service was almost always top-notch. As for excursions, we went swimming with sea lions. It was a lot of fun. We also went snorkeling throught the hut that is located on the beach, to the left. Otherwise, we stayed and played at the resort. There were definitely not as many excursions as Mexico, and no town like Playa del Carmen. This was fine with us. We never felt bored!!I have much more I can say, but I don't want to take up an entire page on Tripadvisor!!! Overall, this was a great trip for the price, and I would, and hopefully will, return. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at nplestina@yahoo.com. If you are looking for fun, relaxation, great service and beauty, the Majestic is a great option!

<Content>5 star all the way We just returned from an awesome 5 day vacation to Punta Cana. We booked through [--] which was fabulous. We had a room upgrade at the Majestic Colonial which is the number 1 hotel in Punta Cana. The service and the rooms are beyond compare. It is the best vacation we have ever had. they keep the grounds and the beach in top condition. The Japanese Restaurant is really worth trying. But all the food in general is pretty good as far as an all inclusive goes. the coffee is better than Starbucks, I brought home 10 pounds of it. We had a great room, it was 2145 with direct access to the pool and our own private terrace with lounge chairs and an outdoor jaccuzzi, and we were only a few steps from the fabulous beach. I am going back and I will not stay anywhere but at the Majestic.

<Content>Watch your towels My wife and I stayed for 5 nights and 6 days. The service was great! The food was above average. Make sure you reserve a night at the Japanese resturant right when you get there. Ask for Fried Chicken (that's the name of a chef). The pool is gorgeous and the Animation team were always making you enjoy the day by the pool. Danny stood out as a great entertainer with boudless energy. He definately got us involved the whole trip.The room was decent and the bathroom is poorly set up. The tub is in the middle of the room and the toilet gives you no privacy. Bring lot's of singles(we brought 200). Even though it's all inclusive the staff will appreciate being tipped. We tipped 2-3 dollars at every meal. We gave a buck at almost every drink order by the pool. And we tipped the animation team and the maid. A few dollars goes a long way.MAKE sure you keep your eyes on your YELLOW pool towels. We put ours out to dry on our 1st floor patio and when we came back 1 was stolen. I called guest services and they told me to go to the front desk and get a new towel card. The guy at the front desk made me feel like he was doing me a favor by giving me the card. The next day i put out our towels by the pool around 8 am ,which i have done everyday.And of course someone stole 1 of my towels again.Luckily a member of the animation team totally took care of me and got me a new towel. If you lose these towels you will have to pay 20 dollars each.So be careful.The overall experience was great.

<Content>Romantic Anniversary Trip My husband and I visited the Majestic from June 1 鈥?June 8 to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. It was our 2nd trip to the Dominican Republic and we have visited many other all inclusives throughout the Caribbean. The Majestic was by far our favorite鈥?My husband and I both have both worked in hotels (He was a Catering Director and Bar Manager. I was a Guest Service Manager and Rooms Division Manager) so we feel like we know what we鈥檙e looking for in a nice hotel鈥?Before we left for our trip, we had emailed both Emily and Norberto (who we heard about in the forums) and had asked for an ocean view. They both emailed us back in a timely manner and were so polite and courteous that we couldn鈥檛 wait to start our trip. Our room (4336) had a beautiful ocean view and we couldn鈥檛 have asked for more. We booked through beach destinations.com and upon arriving at the airport, couldn鈥檛 find our ride to the hotel. It turns out you have to go through hotel beds. Since we were the only people going to the Majestic at that time, we ended up being put in a van where we waited for 20 minutes and then switched to a cab with a driver who did not speak much English. Hotel beds also makes you come back to the lobby the morning after check in to set up your return ride to the hotel. In all, I believe we ended up having to go back to speak to the hotel beds rep. 3 times about our transportation. He was only available after 11 am so it was pretty inconvenient.Check In 鈥?Everything went perfectly鈥?received cold towel and a Majestic cocktail鈥?Oscar Ramirez, the Rooms Division Manager, came out and met us. He introduced us to Laura who helped us set up our reservations for the Japanese and Gourmet restaurants. We had no problem getting reservations (perhaps because we arrived on a Friday?) but I suggest making them at check in anyway. Laura escorted us to our room. Laura and Oscar were especially helpful throughout our stay. They were wonderful and made our stay very special.Room 鈥?Our room was gorgeous. It was just the basic room (no outdoor Jacuzzi) but had a great ocean view. The room was huge! There were a large number of English language channels on the TV which was nice. The air conditioning was great! Our room was always nice and cool. We didn鈥檛 have any ants (not sure what others were talking about). There was a little bit of a musty odor but it wasn鈥檛 offensive. We brought a Glade Plug In with us and that made the room smell fresh throughout our stay. I鈥檇 definitely recommend bringing one. We didn鈥檛 have any problems with housekeeping, the beds, or pillows. We left $1 per day on our pillow for housekeeping. Our room was always clean and we always had more than enough towels. We鈥檇 heard about the doors in the bathrooms but they weren鈥檛 really an issue for us. The shower was huge! We used bottled water to brush our teeth and always drank bottled water in the restaurants. We never got sick. Employees 鈥?For the most part, all were very helpful鈥?especially Laura, Oscar, Albert (at the swim up bar), Nokel (at the buffet by the beach and who waited on us at our private beach dinner) Norberto, Emily, and Felix (in the buffet restaurant).Entertainment 鈥?The shows were the best we鈥檝e seen at an all inclusive. We preferred the 鈥減erformance鈥?type shows versus the audience participation shows. Although we didn鈥檛 have our kids with us, we thought that having kid鈥檚 movies in the evening was a great idea. The casino was pretty small. Enlarging it would definitely help. I believe the space is rented out to the casino and not run directly by the hotel. The sports bar/nightclub was a little disappointing. It was not very big and did not seem busy often. The most crowded we saw it was during the NBA playoffs. Nice big screen鈥?br/>Pool 鈥?It鈥檚 already been said鈥?Pictures do not do it justice. It is huge and never appears crowded. You have the option of being near the action and games by the pool bar or relaxing in one of the many quiet areas. We loved the bahama mamas and blue lagoons by the pool. Bring a bubba keg. You can buy them at Wal-Mart or Target and the bartenders will just fill them up for you if you ask. They keep your drinks nice and cold.Beach 鈥?It鈥檚 absolutely beautiful. We never had any problem getting chairs or a palapa. The swimming area is rocky (rocks are to your left when facing the ocean) in some areas and is good for snorkeling (equipment can be rented for free at hut on beach). There is a rock free area at the right end of the swimming area. Water was just right鈥?not too hot, not too cold. Dance lessons on the beach were fun. There are some topless sunbathers but after the initial shock, you tend not to notice. According to my husband, the ones who went topless were not the ones you wanted to see topless anyway. Note to women鈥?almost everyone wears bikinis here. It does not matter what size you are. Feel free to tan your stomach. No one will notice.Food 鈥?We thought the food was better than at other places we鈥檝e stayed. We liked the fact that reservations were only needed at 2 restaurants and you had many 鈥渙ff-the-menu鈥?choices. Here鈥檚 the breakdown鈥?br/>Taino (Dominican-Mexican) 鈥?Never ate thereRodeo (Steakhouse) 鈥?We LOVED the chateaubriand. Awesome steak鈥?served with fries (weird but okay)Tres Calaberos (Seafood) 鈥?The shrimp was excellent鈥?my husband thought the lobster was just okay鈥?had some weird spicesLe Gourmet (French?) 鈥?Not all that impressed. The desserts were amazing but service was a little slow. Food was okay. Reservations needed.Matsuri (Japanese) 鈥?Awesome show cooking! Huge portions of steak, chicken, shrimp and fish. Reservations needed. You can also go without reservations and eat Chinese.Buffets 鈥?Beach buffet not that great for lunch鈥?basically some fish, hot dogs, and hamburgers. We preferred the buffet by the lobby. It had similar food for lunch and dinner鈥?great pizza and pasta. The lobby buffet has an amazing breakfast鈥?don鈥檛 miss it!Grounds 鈥?Beautiful, very well kept. Miscellaneous 鈥?Try not to shop inside the resort. Prices are outrageous! There is a shopping market (where you can haggle) just outside the gates of the hotel. You walk straight past the lobby, out the front gates and it is on your right. Much better prices.Calling the U.S. from the phones in the room is VERY expensive. Phone cards are available in the gift shop and give much better rates. Don鈥檛 forget your bubba keg.DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE SUN! Bring lots and lots of sunscreen. It is EXTREMELY expensive in the gift shop. You will need more of it than you think. My husband never burns and burned after applying 30 SPF. I used 30 and even 50 SPF and was fine.Stick with bottled water as much as possible. Why take any chances?Take advantage of the photographers walking around. They will take pictures of you at the pool, beach, etc鈥?We did a free photo session on the beach which was so funny! We had a great time and bought a cd of the pictures as a souvenir.Try an 鈥淥h My God鈥?at the lobby bar鈥?Delicious! Beware of the Mama Juana. It鈥檚 very potent, doesn鈥檛 taste that great, and you usually have a piece of mulch (bark) floating at the bottom of your glass.We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and found out through Laura that we could book a romantic private dinner on the beach. We did it and loved it. It was around $150 (pricey!) but seemed well worth it for such a special occasion. We had steak, shrimp, salmon, dessert, and champagne surrounded by moonlight, tiki torches, and candles. We had our own private waiter (Nokel 鈥?the mama Juana man). It was very romantic. They gave us flowers and treated us like royalty. During our stay we received fruit trays, wine, and other special gifts from the hotel. They were amazing!Don鈥檛 be afraid to make some friends鈥?Hi to Jess and Matt from Philly who got engaged while we were there and to our English friends we met at the lobby bar on our last night. We had a great time hanging out with you all!I would highly recommend the Majestic to anyone looking for a romantic getaway!

<Content>beautiful resort This was a very nice resort. The rooms were comfortable, the food wasgood and even excellent in the restaurants that you had to make reservations for. Bring all your medications with you or you will pay. I payed $6.00 for six tylenols. I'm not sure what did it, but I was sick in my stomach for a couple of days...perhaps it was the rum.

<Content>Absolutely Amazing!!! I would recommend this hotel without hesistation. The service was exceptional, in every sense of the word. From the moment you step on the property up until the time that you leave the premises, you are treated like royalty. The ambience is beautiful. The food is delicious. The entertainment is diverse. The grounds are well kept. The rooms are cozy. The staff members are courteous and friendly. Each day is event filled - exercise classes, dance lessons, contests, sports, live bands/insrumentalists, shows, etc. There's always someting to do.

<Content>avoid colonial majestic Large group of us agreed on the following about majestic.1 air conditioning works very poorly in this hotel. get ready for sweating while you sleep2 bar staff were very slow. long waits dont belong on vacation. some were fast, but slow service was unavoidable3 catamarian trip overpriced and one and a half hours ride while bus goes to 9 other hotels. Instead, get a cab directly there - 10 minute ride to dock. No need for advance reservation, either. This is the shark snorkling trip4. not nearly enough staff to handle bookings for excursions. again, get ready for long slow lines5. refridgerators dont work well at this hotel. contents are usually almost room temp - bad for baby bottles or beerNot worth the $ savings, unless you deal well with hot rooms. Too many others in Punta.

<Content>Davila's family the best vacations We just came back from Majestic Colonial and we have a great time . This week was the best vacation for my family. The hotel is very good. We liked the pool at lot. Pool is beatifull. The bars and restaurants are excellent, especially las Tres Carabelas, very good food and we received excellent service from Gino, Anthonino, Julio and Jose Luis. We thank you for treating us like kings............=) . The dinner in the Jappaness Restaurant was wonderfull , Pedro is an excellent cook and nice person , also Cristian was very nice with us all the time giving drinks and very good service. The nigth at the taino restaurant was excellent, delicious Dominican food. We would like to have lunch in this restaurant. We liked the Buffet also and people very nice (Joselito and Guillermina ).My son Diego is 13 years old and he was very happy all week . He loved the game room he played billar and ping pong and he said that he have beatifull vacation but that place should be a little biger with more game tables or different games. We thank Ezequiel at the game room for been so nice with my son. he is very friendly and very professional wit the kids.Rooms are excelelnts one of the best we have stay at. Bella , the housekeepng was very nice and she did excelelnt job.For last we want to thank Juan at reception for been so nice at are departure and wellcome us back and said he personally will take care us.Only complaint and reason that this resort did not make it to excellent is that they do not have a single fan in the open restaurants, theatre for shows and lobby.Thank you very much again.

<Content>Absolutely loved the Majestic! I stayed at the Majestic for a family vacation May 28th-June 6th and it was outstanding! I don't have any complaints. The rooms were beautiful with great views. The pool area was great! I've never stayed at a resort with such a wonderful pool. If you wanted to relax by the pool the end by the lobby was good for that or if you wanted to be by the action, the beach end of the pool as perfect. As for the food-delicious! I loved the seafood restaurant. The lobster was delicious. We also went to the Japanese steak house and that was great! The portions were huge. My parents and brother LOVED the fish they served at the steakhouse. For lunch we went to either buffet. There is something for everyone. The paella was my favorite. The pasta station was also super. I would recommend making reservations your dinners as soon as you arrive. You only need reservations for Japanese and French restaurants. They fill up very fast and many people didn't know this. The Japanese also has a Chinese restaurant in it where reservations are not required. The lemon chicken was delicious. The only place we didn't try was the Dominican/Mexican restaurant/ At night we watched the shows and either headed to the sports bar to watch a game or hung out at one of the many bars. They had a drink called a Dirty Mokey which was refreshing. We did take the Jeep excursion which showed us a lot about the country. I would recommend bringing a camera and wearing lots of sunscreen. Also, when laying out all day make you are you reapplying your sunscreen because the sun is a lot more powerful there then in the US. The market was right outside the resort and you can get great deals. DO NOT pay the asking price. You can expect to pay about half the asking price, if not less. If they don't offer you a price you like, move on to the next vendor. Most of the staff understood basic English so it wasn't too hard to communicate. I found the staff to be very helpful and polite. We met quite a few people. A few people we met were on their honeymoons and having a great time. The Majestic deserves the wonderful reputation they have earned. I will definately be returning to this resort-hopefully in the fall already!!

<Content>Excellent Service and Value for the Money! My wife and I visited June 15-22nd. We are Sandals Signature Guests and were greatly impressed by this resort's appearance, service and value. Very little Spanish helped us communicate nicely with staff. Food was very good for AI. Broiled Lobster for an appetizer, a few drinks in between and main course in the Steakhouse with the Chateaubriand! Desserts were good. Breakfast omelettes were great; freshly squeezed juices were nice touches. Morning Mimosas worked for my lady. Le Gormet restaurnat was good for us. Japanese restaurant was good and entertaining. Seafood Restaurant and Steakhouse at the beach were great. Taino(mexican and Dominican) was not to our liking. Drinks were strong when bartenders were politely addressed and tipped. We had no compalints there. Beach was beautiful; pool was the largest we have seen and very clean. Don't be offended by the topless ladies( I got caught looking a few times myself) Cheapcarribean.com was the way to go for us. . . $2100 for 7 nights with direct Delta airfare from ATL(3hrs) upgraded to pool side suite. We will be back next year with our three daughters and their husbands--great resort, great value for the money!

<Content>Wish we were still there! Stayed with my friend at the Majestic from June 9-16 and it was so much fun. Minor to no complaints overall. Victor at the front desk was the one who truly put smiles on our faces as our room had the best view and it was very quiet up on the 4th floor. The animation team, especially Tyson, Rey and Jesus made our trip more fun and memorable.So much has been said about every detail already it isn鈥檛 easy to come up with anything new. Each restaurant had its good or so-so points but overall the food was great, fresh and varied. Breakfast was always excellent with all kinds of bread and pastries, custom made omelets, fresh fruit/yogurt and the champagne and orange drink was a yummy starter. No wet bathing suits in the main buffet restaurant meant we had to eat at the beach restaurant every lunchtime but we loved the fresh salads and french fries and cangrejo (crab) so we were satisfied. Too bad the grilled fish and chicken was so dry but the beer was delicious and the service fantastic. We switched it up every night trying each restaurant and they all had something to choose from. You can never go hungry or thirsty!The place was well designed for rainy times when you could leave your room and go almost anywhere under cover. The beach was so fabulous we rarely left it except at meal time or for drinks at the pool bar which was the best bar of all. The pool was nice for a fresh swim but the breeze from the ocean made the beach way more appealing. The weather was fantastic every day. Music, exercise and dancing on the beach with the animation team was always a highlight 鈥?those guys are such great dancers and so energetic!The bathroom set up was weird so we took turns going out on the balcony or somewhere else for private time but I was told it was our own 鈥淣orth American hang-up鈥?so I assume the rest of the world enjoys this very non-private arrangement. The 2 sinks were very handy anyway. The one thing we did miss were those little bottles of body lotion in our bathroom which was not included so ladies 鈥?bring body lotion for after sun/shower or you will have to buy it in the store 鈥?no big deal but we were a little surprised that particular item was missing. I have read many times that overhead fans are much needed in the non-air-conditioned seating areas and this is very true.Finally once again thanks so much to the animation team who were so charming always taking time to chat and make us laugh, doing the taqui taqui dance and teaching us Spanish moves in the disco which made the vacation totally perfect and to Victor who put us in the best room. Muchos gracias amigos.

<Content>Awesome!!!!! I just got back from a week-long stay at the Majestic Colonial and my boyfriend and I LOVED it!! Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted with a cold towel and a frozen drink called the Majestic Sunset (a frozen creamsicle). The rooms are absolutely beautiful, complete with oversized beds, ceiling fans, a jacuzzi, and a deck! The only downfall is that the bathrooms are not entirely private (aka they are constructed like bathroom stalls). Let's just say my boyfriend and I made a deal to go on the deck or blare the TV when the other one had to use the bathroom. haha The pool is 1/4 mile long and has something for everyone. Both ends are rather quiet, while there is a wet bar in the middle and games and activities near there. The beach is about 20 feet from the pool and they have different activities there too. I played volleyball a lot and my boyfriend and I both participated in a coconut-throwing contest on the beach. The hotel has energizer staff to get the crowd pumped and involved in all of the activities and it worked. Even though you are there to relax, the activities are a lot of fun. The one thing I would highly recommend doing is taking an excursion. We booked ours through Prieto Tours (in the hotel lobby) and went on a day-long excursion to Catalina Island. We were picked up at 7 am and our tour guide, Carmenia, was the nicest woman in the world. We drove for an hour to Caso de Campo, and she educated us about the Dominican Republic and its people. While it was very interesting, much of it was also very sad since the Dominican Republic is a very poor country. Once we arrived at Caso de Campo, we saw the villas where Michael Jackson, Sammy Sosa, and Shakira all have homes and saw an ampitheatre where Frank Sinatra used to perform. After leaving here, we took a catamaran out to Catalina Island and went snorkeling on this deserted island. We enjoyed a lobster lunch, vitamina (Dominican rum and coke), and dancing on the catamaran on the way back. Most of us were a little drunk at this point from the vitamina and the waves tossed us about like we were fish...let's just say it made for some funny dancing. Anyway, the Majestic Colonial was amazing and I would go back in a heartbeat. I had heard mixed reviews about Punta Cana in general before I went and I can't figure out why. Perhaps we enjoyed it more because of where we stayed....the staff were warm and welcoming and made us feel at home. Overall, here are some tips:1. avoid the water - drink only bottled water!! They will tell you that they use bottled water in their pitchers to fill your glasses, but it's not true. ASK FOR A BOTTLE THAT YOU CAN OPEN YOURSELF. 2. Food: The stewardess on the way down told us to avoid pork products. We also stayed away from most fish. You aren't sure how they keep it and cook it, so it's better to be safe than sorry.3. We were awakened early by the maids about 4 of the 7 days we were there. I think they had a censor/motion detector outside the door to indicate to them whether or not we were in the room (iRobot?), but if you are asleep, clearly you aren't making any motion. You might want to ask how to avoid this at the front desk. Or, just make your own Do Not Disturb sign and hang it on the front door.4. Drink lots of Presidente beer!! - the mixed drinks are not good. Plus, the yeast in the beer helps eat up any bad bacteria that you may have eaten.5. Apply your sunscreen religiously throughout the day...otherwise, you will wind up positively scorched. My boyfriend and I sat in the shade (he had 50 SPF on) and he still got burned!! 6. Bring single dollar bills with you. Often, they don't have change or you have to get money from the ATM in pesos. 7. Bring snacks! I was craving American food by the end of the week and paid $5 for a thing of Pringles!!! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at lradano@gmail.com. Have a wonderful trip and enjoy the Majestic Colonial!!!

<Content>Great pool - matress is a killer Stayed there from May 20 to May 27, 2007. Used Cheapcarribean.com. Got the upgrade but did not want a first floor room where all the upgrades are. The reason is that only the first floor has the outside jucuzzi. Who wants to sit in a hot tub with people walking by. There are no walls between you and the public. I never saw one person in their outside hottub the entire week, day or night. No privacy at all. so took a 3rd. floor room that was smaller than the upgraded first floor and it was fine. The toilet has no privacy . Who wants to hear other people's bathroom sounds. Gross. The worst thing was the mattress and pillows. The mattress was so hard after 4 nights my back was killing me. I tried sleeping on the floor with blankets, in the tub, but to no avail. I ended up going to the Sports Bar at 3 a.m. and getting sloshed so I could sleep. the couch is a tiney loveseat and you can't sleep on it either. I ripped the sheets off the bed on the 4th night and spilt soda on them so they would replace them with clean ones. Never could get a washcloth. Pool and ocean were great. Ocean has coral and a firend stepped on a anemone and had 7 barbs in the heel that broke off. Thank goodness i brought perioxide, antibiotics, Bactine, pain pills, neosoporin, etc. Would recommend you bring your own medicines because it really saved a bundle. Food was fine but make sure you go immediately to the Service Desk next to the Check in and book the Japanese and Gourmet restaurants. They were the best. Also, the chateaubrion at the beach was great. The Mexican restaurant was pretty lame. Who wants lots of tacos anyway. Kids maybe. Chinese was worth it also, would have gone there more often if had stayed llonger. The buffets were pretty boring after a few days, same ole same ole. Overall, if I went back would have gotten the upgrade but only if on the pool side and away from the Pool Bar where all the noise (speakers on at 10 am till 6 pm). They have loud music (and Games - tic, tac, toe, exercise, etc) all day long . Would have bought an air mattress at the store and used it on the mattress. Would not have brought a laptop, links are $5.00 US per 30 minutes. Connection was lousy. Would have brought rubber sandles for the area in the beach where there is coral. Did snorkeling (brought my own) and that was neat. Saw several pretty fish. If you don't know how to use a catamarand, they won't let you take one out, even tho it is free. I saw several captsize is why.

<Content>Good Deal My wife and went with two other couple friends and stayed for 5 days. Overall, our experience was good. The rooms were relatively clean and spacious. The showers, jacuzzi and bathroom areas were the nicest. The beds were tough, the bedding thin. Air-conditioning was cold! TV only had a handful of cable stations, Showtime being one of them. The food was okay. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. The lunch buffet was bad. The dinner options were varied but we had only a handful of good experiences. Make sure to get langustines at the grill near the beach for dinner. Drinks were plentiful and free since we were all inclusive. Room service was just okay too. They should rethink their approach to food in general. But couldn't complain since it was all inclusive. The pool was nice and large - so no fighting for spots. The beach was nice too, but getting chairs was a bit more challenging near the water. Sand is soft and pink and the water is blue and slightly rough. They try and make your stay fun with activites and games. I played in a ping pong tourney while there and won! Casino is small but adequate and well air conditioned. They also have shows of varying themes each night. If you're not into either, there's not much to do around there, unless you leave the resort which seemed more trouble than it's worth. Glad to go with friends because we spent lots of time together and helped pass the evenings. Bring DVDs if you want to pass time at night. Overall - this place is a great deal for the price we paid. I would go back if going with a large group.

<Author>PCLOVERToronto(ont)
<Content>Fantastic,Amazing,Top Notch, Our Majestic adventure started off from Toronto.We flew with sunwing airlines.It was a very smooth comfortabile flight .Absoloutley no problems. We arived to sunshine and blue skies in Punta Cana And we were lucky because that is how it stayed for the entire week that we were there.We wisked through the plesant airport and were off to the Majestic.  We arived at the beautifull Majestic,We were in awe as to how beautifull this place really is. Pictures do not do justice to this place.It is amazing how stunning this place really is .Beautifull, Breathtaking, We were given a cool towl and a cool Majestic drink wene we checked in.The people at the front desk were kind and courtious, and has helpfull as can be. We booked our 2 dinner reservations right off the bat,took a little tour of the place,courtesy of the great lady at the customer sevice desk. We were given room #2345.Wich over looked the beautifull pool. We were right across from the main pool bar and the faboulouse animation team.Truley an amazing room and and amazing view. If you tilted your head to the left we could see the ocean. I new this trip was going to be alright.Our room was spacious clean ,just beautifull.I know Iv been using the word beautifull a lot but let me just tell you this place ,What a place , you must see it to understand what im talking about. The rooms are an open concept room. But if your with your hubby it shouldent be a problem.There were plenty of channels on the television ,the movie network ,espn,discovery channel.There was a mini fridge stocked with water, and pops,and beer, There was a safe in the closet for your valubiles. before i left for this trip I found out that the pool was rated as the best pool in the carribean . Well let me tell you what a pool it never seemed to end. And no matter how many people were in the pool it always seemed like no body was there. It was huge plenty of room for every one. you could find a quiet place to relax or if you wanted to party it up you could find that to . There was always something happaning in the pool .Pool volley ball, water polo, water arobics, Im still felling the affects of that one.Just awsome. The beach is one of the most beautifull beaches i have ever seen ,and wich is one of the main reasons why i keep comming back to Punta Cana, and why I will continue to keep commimg back to Punta Cana.Simply beautifull . We never had a hard time finding a pallapa hut. There was plenty for everyone. But i would sugest that you get to the beach earlier to get a hut if you really want one . We were at the beach every morning at around 10:00 no problems. There are tons of food options . Breakfast at the main resteraunt was very good . Tons of food options. Lunch was not to good in my opion . The beach resteraunt for lunch was not as good as the main resteraunt. Dinner no matter where you go was fantastic. We loved the Jappanese resteraunt. And if you go ask for the cook named fried chicken he was amazing. This resort is very beautifull and the staff in my opion are very good . You just must remember that you are in there country and a little respect and a little smile goes a long way. these two words will make your vacation that much better .HOLA, and GRCIAS. Well my Majestic Exsperience was very good .I would recomend this hotel to anyone. I cant wait to go back .I am already trying to book for next year . Dont wory about bad reviews about this place because honestly there are none. This resort is truley amazing you wont regret it trust me .

<Author>Boston_ABbaby
<Content>Heaven, Heaven, Heaven I'm going to start this with a few basic facts about us because I believe it's important to contextualize my experience a bit. First: I have never been to an AI before, my boyfriend has been to one, in Aruba. Second: I am 27 y.o. and my boyfriend is 30. Third: I'm going to try and keep this brief, and just share what I think are the most important details. Third: We were there from May 22nd-May 30th, 2007Airport: Arrived at 2:30pm. Paid a $10 Tourist fee. We were through the airport and out to our bus (we booked through AAA and our transfers were included) in about 20 minutes, including time to collect bags/go through customs/use the bathroom.Arrival: The same as all the rest. Quick, easy, low key. Lovely non-alcoholic cocktail. Cold, Lavender scented towel. We were loaded into a small van with our bags and driven to our room. Only one of our keys worked when we got to our room and the man helping us zipped right back to the front desk and brought us a new one within ten minutes. That one didn't work either, but we learned from other guests throughout the week that this is common, but eventually we got two keys that worked; it just took a few tries!!Room: Lovely, big, clean, and cool. We had an ocean view with a balcony. We paid for the basic room and I emailed ahead and asked for an ocean view/king size bed/not on the first floor. We got it. The bed was hard, the sheets not so soft, and the pillows thin. We were so tired by the end of the day that it didn't matter and we both fell asleep without problem. The jacuzzi was great, the shower huge. There is a large closet, two sinks, hairdryer, robes, just a few hangers, a safe that you program yourself, and a large TV with remote. We got lots of channels, but reception was spotty, so we mostly relied on Discovery Channel and CNN. There was a complimentary bottle of Champagne when we arrived and the mini-fridge was refilled daily with beer, diet pepsi, pepsi, orange soda, 7UP, water, and chocolate bars. We never had a problem with noise in the room. Our room was cleaned daily without problem; and we hung a Do Not Disturb sign on the doorknob each night before bed. We bought $2 worth of washcloths from Target before we left after reading everyone's complaints of not being able to get them and then just left them there when we came home. Scented candle was quite helpful.Food: Fine. Some things were very good, some not so good. But we could always find something we liked, and many things we really liked. We always ate breakfast at the main buffet and bounced back and forth between the main buffet and the beach buffet for lunch. Just a note about breakfast: there is a seemingly little known about continental breakfast served out by the pool bar where the band plays at night for those who don't want to go all out. We ate dinner most nights at the main buffet, although we did branch out for the Japanese and Gourmet, both of which required reservations. Both were very good. Illness: I always get sick when I travel. That said, I also tend to be someone who believes When in Rome... and will eat just about anything because I feel that often the best food in a foreign country is what the locals are eating at small food stalls. This trip, however, I was adamant about staying healthy and was quite careful about what I ate, as was my boyfriend, and neither of us got sick. The people I met who did get sick ate without thinking; subsequently my advice is this: Take acidophilus/pro-biotics before you go and while you're there. You can take Pepto as a preventive thing (the CDC says two tabs, 3x a day) but we quickly learned that this caused the exact opposite problem we were trying to avoid. If you don't recognize it, don't eat it. If it's supposed to be cold and it isn't, don't eat it. If it's supposed to be hot, and it isn't, don't eat it. If it's been sitting there for two hours, don't eat it. If it's raw, don't eat it. Also, people keep saying the spent so much money on supplies when they did get sick. We brought our Pepto, Tylenol, thermometer, Gatorade Powder (to prevent dehydration in the event of illness), etc. Although we didn't need them, we met people who did, and who had spent $90 on the same things in the DR.Alcohol: Plentiful. Wonderful mixed and frozen drinks, beer, and wine. I recommend the Dirty Monkey, the Majestic, and the Mojito. My Cosmopolitans were also quite good. Bring an insulated mug (whether it's a Bubba Keg or not, doesn't matter. We brought our travel coffee mugs and were SO glad we did. The plastic cups are tiny and the drink melts.)Beach: Perfect. Nothing more to say than that. Never a problem getting a palapa. Clean, soft sand. Miles to walk. Places to snorkel right off the becah. Bring a floatie ($3 at Target), it's great for the beach and the pool....Pool: Enormous. Lobby to beach without stopping. Plenty of space for quiet and plenty of space for fun. Again. Bring the floatie. It gets hot in the sun, and reading while floating is lovely.Entertainment: The band, the piano bar, and the sax player were great each evening, and sitting listening to music in the open air with a cocktail before dinner was perfect. Appetizers: Every night in front of the main bar at the bottom of the Lobby stairs. And they always had a Cocktail of the Night to go with the food.We went on this vacation looking to eat, read, sleep, tan, drink, float, swim, snorkel, and relax. And that's exactly what we got. We are planning to return at Christmas with our families; which means we loved our trip so much that we have recruited 12 people to return with us in less than a year.

<Content>Very pleased We stayed at the Majestic from June 16 - 21. Read the reviews on Tripadvisor and knew what to expect.We were worried though about the weather but it was hot and sunny throughout except for a brief 20 minute drizzle on our last day.I'd give this place a 4* rating. Pretty good, minor complaints.Some points:Cons-1. Food was not the greatest, but we still ate like pigs!2. Rooms could have been a little nicer. Cracks in floors and furniture. The phones did not have instructions on it for contacting the front desk or friends in other rooms, so we just did not use it. Bathroom was an issue, built for couples who do not have secrets. 3. Grounds were well kept, but the concrete by the pool was broken in some areas and couldn't walk barefoot. Plus with all of the groundskeepers, always a smell of pesticide.4. Language barrier, not a huge problem, but was a pain to get soap restocked, even though they restocked everything else in the room.5. Tennis court is really far away, didn't even try to walk there to play a couple of matches.6. Don't expect much from the Disco or casino, if those are priorities, would not come here.7. Shows were ok, but most of it was audience participation. I'd avoid it 'cause there's no AC.Pros-1. Absolutely gorgeous grounds. Layout is pretty good and doesn't feel too big.2. Friendly staff, they really work hard and are very accommodating.3. Food was ok, but I would stick to the main buffet - lots of variety and best food around. Didn't get sick, but bring some pepto just in case.4. Bars everywhere, but all well drinks. Stick to the rum (pina coladas, Majestic con rum). Mamajuana isn't the smoothest going down, but will hit you hard if you drink a few shots of it. Presidente beer was also cool and refreshing. 5. Rooms were nice, no musty smell, nice view, and the AC was decent. 6. Beach was nice, just had some rocks and seaweed, au natural. Pool was great, even for a late night swim.Tips-1. Bring dollar bills to tip the great staff, about 15 - 20 bucks per day, on average.2. Bring lots of suntan lotion, gets really hot and can burn easily and ruin some of your days. Plus expensive in stores there. 3. Check your cell-phone to see if it has international calling. Had a $5 phone card, but no pay phones. Wasn't gonna venture off the property, or risk spending lots of money on hotel phone. 4. Always haggle at the shops/tables, could get items originally quoted at $30 for 8 bucks! (about 32 pesos per $1)5. Bring a thermal cup for drinks and even an inflatable raft to take to the pool. Bring an OFF candle, gives a nice scent and keeps bugs away. 6. Don't need converters for electrical devices, safe was easy to use, most of staff speaks English well. Didn't bother with spa, excursions and so forth, just relaxed!7. Not the greatest for singles or young groups.If you just wanna chill out in a decent place, then go for it.

<Content>Not as good as it sounds We arrive on Saturday June 16, 2007 a family of 9 . I must say that we were not impress with this hotel or it鈥檚 hospitality, this place is overrated and not what I was expecting, me being a returning vacationer in Punta Cana was disappointed with the food the activities and the hospitality the casino and the staff, so far I think that the Ivero Star is not as nice as the Majestic but it beats the Majestic in every other category, This hotel should be rated 3 stars not 5鈥?. RC and family

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We just returned from the Majestic yesterday and thought I would write before time goes by. This was our 7th A.I. resort and we learn new tips each time. My family consists of a 15 year old boy and a 12 year old girl. Here goes:1. Rooms- Beautiful, but do smell a bit musty. No big deal...just bring fresheners. We did not find it a problem with the frosted glass door as the toilet door. WE did request adjoining rooms, but were given rooms next to each other. With a 15 year old boy I wanted to keep a closer eye on him. Went to the front desk and was able to switch the next day...no problem. To address the people that complained that the front desk was not friendly I just want to say it's ALL in the approach. If you go to them demanding things that's what you're going to get anywhere.2.Beach- It was the most beautiful beach we have been to date. Very large with plenty of palapas to choose from. I do agree that there needs to be a beach bar and waiter service on the beach especially being a 5 star resort. They need billiard tables down by the beach area.3. Activities-The Animation team was superb!!! They were really good at getting people involved without being too pushy. One tip...they say they have a banana boat....yeah they do, but for $12 US for 15-20 minutes per EACH person!!! Suffice it to say we never saw the boat out.4.Food- Buffet was just OK. Food was rarely hot and sometimes not even warm. Gourmet was excellent. Wanted to try Matsuri, but the earliest we could get was 9:30 all week even when I booked right when we arrived. The restaurant by the beach was fabulous. Tip- Dinner at night had steak on one side and seafood on the other. The only thing I didn't like was you coulnd't order seafood on the steak side and vice versa even though it comes out of the SAME kitchen!5. Drinks- No need to ask for doubles! If you want Mojitos you must get them at the bars in the lobby areas and they often ran out of mint. Be careful if you have children. My 15 and 12 year old seemed to get alcoholic drinks at the lobby bar on our last night.6. Tours- We went on the Monster safari tour and had a blast. They have old Russian Humvees-8 wheel drive. The staff was terrific. Would highly recommend it. We did take a free trip into the cigar shop. It was a small shop in a new plaza with nothing else nearby. I was thinking cigar/jewlery/souvenir shop....NOT so! The cigar shop was a couple of locals trying to get their business started. They were nice enough, but nothing name brand. Did not go to the market right outside the resort. The shops on the resort are ridiculously over priced!!!! Tip- a pack of smokes in the cigar shop on the resort $10.00 and NO Canadian smokes.Finally, bring lots of ones for tipping...yes they deserve tips for a job well done as well. Booked through Cheapcarribean which was fine except for American Airlines part...That was a disaster both going and coming...won't go into it now, but 2 days home and still NO luggage!!!!!!

<Content>Great time at the Majestic My family and I just returned from six nights at the Majestic. We booked a two room suite since we have 2 children. Upgrading to a suite is something I would recommend. AIRPORT: Alot different than the states. The only thing that bothered me was when you first enter the airport, you are greeted by two girls dressed in island costume. They take a picture of you and your family with them and then they basically tell you to go away. I did not like how we were treated and did not purchase a photo. RESORT: Just beautiful. Check-in was very easy and we were shown to our suite by Victor The suite was on the fourth floor and was more than we expected. The main bed was HUGE and having the extra room and oversized balcony was excellent. Our room overlooked the pool and was great place to relax and smoke a Dominican cigar. Everyone is right, there is no privacy with the bathroom. The showers are oversized and the jetted tub was nice. Maid service was good. Hint-bring a plug in room freshener, eliminates any musty smell. Did I mention that the resort was beautiful.FOOD: I have been to many all-inclusive resorts in Mexico. The food here is just as good or better. Yes, its not perfect or mom's cooking, but we did find the buffet to be very good. SKIP the French Restaurant, it was terrible. The Japanese restaurant was great. The chef cooks the food right in front of you, and it was very good. My main complaint was the so called Beach Grill. It was confusing as to when they started serving food and then they would only allow you to sit in certain areas. Not impressed. Oh by the way, desserts were too good. BEACH AND POOL: The beach was very nice and there were just enough waves for my two boys to have a good time. The pool was great just as the other reviewers have mentioned. We spent time in both and had a great time. EXCURSIONS: We did three excursions; the Caribbean Festival Cruise where you snorkel and swim with sharks/stingrays. We drove the four wheelers and also did a Safari truck trip. I enjoyed all three and it is well worth your time to see the country. To summarize; The Majestic is first class and we would not hesitate in returning.

<Content>Perfect! My husband and I stayed June 15-June 20 at the Majestic Colonial. We booked through Cheap Caribbean. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised. The excellent service began as soon as we walked into the lobby. We had a free upgrade to an oceanview room which was a nice surprise. Pictures don't do this place any justice. It is so beautiful. I don't quite understand the negative reviews. The bed was comfy. The room was clean. Our fridge was always stocked. Everyone at the resort was very pleasant and went out of their way to make us feel like royalty. We tipped well. The staff earned it though. If you are reading this please learn a little Spanish if you don't know any, in preparation for your trip. I thought it was rude that alot of guests never greeted the staff in Spanish. They always approached me with Spanish so learning some definitely helped us. My husband and I did attend a couple of shows. We were entertained but not impressed. They worked hard to put on a show but it was a step up from high school talent shows. The theater was nice however there were ALOT of rude guests who would stand in the front of the theater recording the show with their video cameras and blocking about 50 people behind them,It was very annoying that no one had any regard for the people behind them. At both shows we went to we always had a problem. Between the abnoxious large man in front of us who kept standing up to call attention to the barmaid and kept sending the same drink back at least 3 times and the people taking pictures or recording the show we decided to not attend anymore shows. We would have liked to watch them without constant interruption. People please kneel if you decide to take pictures in the front of the theater. Have some respect for others! Our only issues were with rude guests and the security at Punta Cana Airport. At the airport, security treated us like animals. They were very disrespectful to my husband and I. I do intend to file a complaint with mgmt there. The hotel was AMAZING and the staff was AMAZING. We do plan to go back one day. If you are going to the Majestic I wish you a safe trip. Embrace the beauty of the resort and the Domincan people. Please have a drink for us. We loved it. God Bless you! Email me w/ any questions. TracyAnnV@comcast.net

<Content>Loved The Majestic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We stayed at the Majestic in May. I was with my husband for our 20th anniversary. We never travel alone so we didn't know what to expect. Just to give more of a background, we are mid-forties and travel at least twice a year to all inclusives. We have been to Aruba, Mexico, Bahamas,Jamaica and Martinique. We have three teenagers who travel with us in July. If we are not with the kids we are with our best friends. This trip was different!We loved the Majestic!We thought it was beautiful. The pool was something like we have never seen before. HUGE  spotless!We felt that the service was the best we have ever encountered. If I sipped my water at a restaurant, someone was there to fill it. All of the help were so gracious. We love the Dominican people anyway but these people went above and beyond.We Loved the food. The only complaint we had was that the food at breakfast was cold. The coffee,however, made up for that. Delicious!!!!We are going back on July 24th with our kids and we can't wait!!

<Content>Majestic is Paradise I recently just got back from the Majestic and I wish I wouldn't have left. From the moment we arrived the experience was everything I thought it would be. Once you get off your Transportation from the Airport you have a bellboy handing you a cold towel with a hint of mint on it. That was a great refresher due to the extreme hot weather their was that day. I didn't even walk 10 steps before I also received a cold and refreshing fruit drink from one of their staff. That hit the spot after traveling 2.5 hours. Checking in was very fast , but one thing was when we arrived at the room we asked for two double beds instead of a king size bed. But that was corrected with one phone call to the reception and they sent over a bellboy with a new set of keys to the new room and helped us with our luggage. This saved us from walking back to reception which was a long walk due to that its a pretty big resort. The food was excellent we ate at the seafood restaurant the steak restaurant located next to the beach so their was a nice breeze at night. Also tried the buffet for breakfast , lunch and dinner andit was great. Fresh food at all times. The service was great I don't think I had for more than 30 seconds an empty glass of water or a dirty dish in front of me. You must check out the Beach and the Pool. Try to get a chair under the tikki huts on the beach because it gets very hot. The pool you can pretty much find a chair since the pool is so big. Met alot of new people made some friends at the end it was worth the every penny!!!!!! Some advise for them would be to build a bar at the beach so you don't have to walk far to get a drink or add waiter serivce to the beach. Also make sure they don't promote activites with prizes you won't get after winnning the contest. But at the end it was oney well spent, If I ever go back I plan to return to the Majestic.

<Content>Majestic is the best! First a little background. We are a married couple, I鈥檓 in my 40s and hubby in his 50s. We have travelled to the DR 4 times now and other islands in the Caribbean including St Lucia, Barbados, Tobago and Grenada and we have also stayed in Mexico鈥檚 Mayan Riviera. We have also travelled to other parts of the world including North America, India and Australia as well as various European countries (we love our vacations!). I speak a little Spanish (I took it at school many years ago) and people always seem to appreciate the effort, even if I make dreadful mistakes these days with my vocabulary!The purpose of our holiday was to relax in a nice resort on a good beach in a good room with good food at a la carte restaurants (we don鈥檛 like buffets for dinner). We have previously been to Sosua (15+ years ago when there were no big hotels) and 2 years ago to Ocean Bavaro Spa  Beach Resort, last year to Sunscape the Beach and then this visit to the Majestic Colonial.Ever since I booked Ocean Bavaro 2 years ago I have been an avid reader of TripAdvisor and it was based on the reviews that we first chose to go to STB last year and then chose to go to the Majestic this year (we would have returned to STB except that we wanted to try and find better food and a shorter transfer time).In summary of our review that follows 鈥?we absolutely loved the Majestic and I don鈥檛 feel the need to try and find anywhere better in the DR, our next beach holiday will definitely be back at the Majestic. We were at the Majestic from 4-18 June.Arrival at check-in. Greeted with the wet towel and refreshing cocktail. There were only 3 other couples checking in at the same time as us and check-in was speedy and very friendly. Our room was 2340 which we went to and our baggage followed us about 10 minutes later. Our room was excellent. It is the largest standard room we have stayed in in the Caribbean. I requested a top floor, pool view near the beach and was lucky enough to get it. We had a four-poster large double bed, and the usual bathroom as described by others. The Jacuzzi was great 鈥?we鈥檝e only had that before in Mexico. The shower was very large and the water pressure good and the water was always hot. We also had a vaulted ceiling which was nice. The balcony is of a very good size with a table and two chairs. We had the pool view and a sideways view of the ocean 鈥?beautiful! The a/c worked fine although you do need to re-set it if there is a power cut. There was also a ceiling fan. The a/c remains on while you are not in the room and only goes off if the balcony door is left open. You do not need a 鈥榢ey鈥?to activate the a/c. Another good thing as far as I was concerned was that there was enough bright light by the vanity units for me to apply my make-up in the evening 鈥?quite often rooms in the Caribbean are too dark, there is also a magnifying vanity mirror which is great for those of us who need reading glasses! There were also enough available electrical sockets for all my husband鈥檚 chargers. Apart from 2 days when I had to ask the maid for them, we always had 2 face cloths with all the other towels. Robes and slippers are also provided. Our room was clean and kept clean very well 鈥?one of the cleanest rooms we have stayed in and in fact the whole resort was kept very clean all the time. We had no bugs in the room while we were there and did not have any need of the can of roach spray we brought with us (we always do when travelling to humid climates). One of the light bulbs in our bedside lamp wasn鈥檛 working when we arrived. We went to guest services to report it after breakfast(I wanted to meet them, rather than call) and it was fixed by the time we got back to our room to change for lunch.Beach 鈥?Bavaro beach is just beautiful. You can walk for miles should you so wish in either direction. It is also the first resort where we did not need to play the 鈥榯owel game鈥?for a palapa on the beach (my husband burns very easily). The resort was fairly empty the first week of our stay but seemed to be at full capacity in the second. The thing that really pleased me about the beach was that if you didn鈥檛 want to hear the animation team and their music, you didn鈥檛 have to 鈥?you just went to the other end of the beach, whereas at other resorts it has not been possible to avoid the noise, or they even have piped music onto the beach/around the resort which personally drives me crazy. At the Majestic, if all I wanted to hear was the sound of the ocean 鈥?I could. However, if you wanted to participate in the activities 鈥?no problem. There is no bar service on the beach but the bar at the restaurant by the beach is very close and I did not consider this a problem. My only negative comment would be that there are only 2 ladies rooms near the beach, and there was usually a queue. The beach has showers to rinse off the salt and sand at the 4 entrances to the beach.Pool. We mainly kept to the beach, as that is what we like but we did spend a few afternoons by the pool and it is beautiful. We always managed to find a palapa when we turned up and also you can find a quiet area if you don鈥檛 want to be in the middle of all the activity/noise. They do not provide floats at the Majestic 鈥?which I personally think is a good thing as when we were at STB they just seemed to be a source of conflict with people taking them out of the pool and not sharing. We took our own floats and spent a happy time floating around the pool. There is waitress bar service at the pool and Bianca is a very friendly and helpful waitress. There are also two bars (one of which has swim up section). Again, there are showers by the pool to rinse off in. We never had any problems getting fresh pool/beach towels, even when the hotel was really busy.Food 鈥?daytime. Breakfast in the main buffet restaurant is from 7 until 10 am. There is an excellent selection of food from juices, fruits, pancakes, waffles, eggs cooked to order, bacon, meats, cheese, cereals, yoghurts, breads, pastries, etc. The thing that really impressed me was the speed of service at the tables for coffee and tea and clearing away dirty plates etc. This is the best service I have ever had anywhere. We made sure to sit in the same section each day and our waitress always brought our drinks without asking 鈥?my tip would be to sit in Mirian鈥檚 section 鈥?she is absolutely the best. If you miss breakfast here, you should know that you can get a continental breakfast from 10.30 until 12 at the restaurant by the beach. We never needed to try it but it looked fine.Lunch 鈥?you have the option of returning to the main buffet restaurant or eating at the buffet in the restaurant at the beach. We did both and our preference was for the main buffet as there was more choice. Please note that if you use this restaurant you cannot go there in wet costumes as the seats are padded and you will be turned away, which is only right as people eating there in the evening don鈥檛 want to sit on wet seats. However at the beach restaurant they have removable seat pads which are taken off during the day and you can eat there in your wet costume no problem. The selection of food is varied and at the main buffet you can always get pizza or pasta as well as fish, meats, salads, paella etc. Again, if you are at the main buffet sit in Mirian鈥檚 section and if you are at the beach restaurant Francisco will take good care of you.Evening. We don鈥檛 like buffets in the evening and chose the Majestic as it has a selection of a la cartes. The food was the best we have had at an AI. We tried all the restaurants and our favourites were the Seafood restaurant (Tres Cabaleros), the steakhouse (Rodeo Grill) and the Tepanyaki. We also liked the Gourmet restaurant and the Chinese a la carte. The Mexican was good 鈥?but neither of us is a big fan of Mexican food. The seafood was very good 鈥?the lobsters and prawns fresh and well cooked and if you wanted more then all you had to do was ask. The Rodeo grill鈥檚 chateaubriand is excellent and they cook it just how you ask for it. Francisco is a great waiter and we tried to always sit in his section, although service was also good from others. The Tepanyaki (reservations required) is good fun and entertaining and the food is also good. We liked the Gourmet and ate there twice but to be honest we liked the seafood and the steak restaurants so much we chose to go there instead.The thing that impressed me was that we didn鈥檛 have to wait for a table except for once or twice when it was literally only a couple of minutes. If I can compare this to STB it is a big difference. They also operate a no-booking policy (there are 2 restaurants at the Majestic that you have to book but everything else is on a turn-up basis). At STB we were often turned away from restaurants because they didn鈥檛 have the capacity or, if they didn鈥檛 say a flat 鈥榥o more tonight鈥?the wait for a table was around half to three quarters of an hour, not a problem, but it is much nicer to be able to get a table where and when you want to. Both resorts appear to have a similar amount of rooms and we stayed at STB at a similar time of year last year and I would say that occupancy was about the same, however the difference is that the restaurants at the Majestic appear to have a much bigger seating capacity. Also the service is faster (but they don鈥檛 chase you out of your seats if you want a leisurely dinner). Again, the standard of the food and the service we received was the best we have had. We didn鈥檛 have the silver-grey wristbands of the North Americans 鈥?so a tip (although we always left one) wasn鈥檛 necessarily expected and we didn鈥檛 have the red wristbands of the Spanish, so we weren鈥檛 obvious Spanish speakers either. We do however always smile and say thank you, which goes a long way wherever you are.Throughout the resort we found everyone friendly and helpful without exception.The shows. Typical AI Caribbean shows, some better than others. The theatre is a nice set up and comfortable too and the waitress service very efficient.The Casino, small but seemed bigger than the one at STB to me. Generous slot machines (although I managed to restrict myself to two visits only 鈥?my husband can鈥檛 bear gambling).Disco, can鈥檛 really comment on this as we were usually too tired or preferred a drink at the lobby bar (which is a great place to be). Others have commented on the jazz player in the early evening 鈥?and it is lovely to hear the music while you are either out on the terrace bar or inside at the lobby bar. There is also a piano bar in the upstairs reception, but we didn鈥檛 really use this.Guest services. What a lovely group they are. They were all fluent in English, friendly and helpful. We met Emily 鈥?who is a very friendly, efficient and well educated person. Whatever you need 鈥?from any fault reporting to reservations to bellboys 鈥?guest services is the number to call. Check-out was speedy and no problems and we were even able to get bellboys at the last minute when, due to a power failure in the area, the lifts were not working and we really didn鈥檛 fancy getting hot and sweaty taking our bags down stairs.OK, I must apologise for this long, long review, but I wanted to be sure to cover as much as possible (and I know that as soon as I post this I will think of something else I meant to say). We just had a truly wonderful time and I cannot wait to go back there (and no, I am not being paid for my review!)Any questions, just ask.

<Content>Food Poisoning on my 3rd day I stayed at majestic colonial in 2006, but never had a chance to share my views. I seen good reviews for it then and good ones now, and I have no idea why.. fake reviews?My experience:Food:HORRIBLE. I got food poisoning on my 3rd day there, and my stomach is not sensitive at all, I usually never get this. Had diarrhea all night and day, until I could not take it anymore and went to see the resort's medical staff. I was charged around $200 to get anti-diarheal shots and pills. Resort would not pay for this.Service:Below Average, it felt like they are doing you a favor when you call them.Hotel:Above Average. Rooms were beautiful.In general, I am shocked by the ratings on this place... makes me wonder how to compare to other ratings

<Content>Take me back to the Majestic! Since I have just come back from my stay at the Majestic, I dream all day long of returning back there. I wish I could hop the next flight and be back on the gorgeous beach once again. I traveled down to the Majestic with 3 of my girlfriends and 2 of our mothers. We did vary in age but I can speak for all of us and say that we had the best time. When we first arrived we couldn鈥檛 stop smiling. We were greeted with warm towels and a drink, how perfect. The rooms were stunning and also very clean. I couldn鈥檛 have asked for anything more. Everything about the Majestic was just perfect. We were greeted with 鈥淗ola鈥檚鈥?and a smile everywhere we went. The waiting staff was on top of everything and never slacked off. The bartenders and servers were great and very friendly. All of the staff was a pleasure to get to know and be around. The most lively of them all was of course the entertainment staff. We were constantly on the beach doing aerobics, volleyball, contests and of course dancing. The show at night was always entertaining thanks to Dani who was so full of life and energy. The staff were some of the greatest people I have ever met and thank them all, Kiko, Rey, Nelson, Tyson, Pablo, Samuel, Andres, Kelly, Welise, Alexandra, Maria and of course Jesus the great rapper, for making our trip so great. We would all travel back just to see them, that is just how much we appreciate them. And of course we have to thank them all for teaching us how to dance so good, especially with the taqui taqui:)I have nothing bad to say about the Majestic. The food and drinks were all good. On the beach it was never an issue of finding a place to sit, it was all there for you. All in all the Majestic was an awesome place to stay. The rooms, the service, the beach, the activities, the workers, everything and everyone about the Majestic were just perfect. I would highly highly recommended anyone to stay at the Majestic, take my word for it, you won鈥檛 be disappointed.

<Content>Great, with some quirks My trip overall was great. The hotel was beautiful, and most of the staff were friendly. The airport experience was hard because many of the employees did not speak engish at all. On the resort some employees spoke a little engish, at least enough to understand our need, etc. As an American the first few days on the resort, we were the minority to other visitors of the hotel who were from all over the world. There was a great mix of international spice!!!! The weather was awesome, and there was always a breeze on the beach. However, shopping on the resort is really non-existent... they only sell really cheap jewlery for way too much and knock off American clothing. I also had my cell phone stolen out of my room while it was charging by an employee while I was out at dinner, who came in by using an swipe key. SO MAKE SURE YOU PUT EVERYTHING IN THE SAFE at ALL times!! There was also a slight problem with bugs in our room. It is the carribean so it is expected, but it got to the point where they were in our bed one night. Overall, it was an awesome trip, just a few quirks. I would recommend this place, with caution.

<Content>Wonderful Honeymoon Newly Wed from St. Catharines Ontario CanadaMy new bride and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial for our honeymoon from June 2 to 9. It was a suprise to her where we were going and shewas very pleased with my selection.The Food was excelent, the staff was always adding fresh food to the buffet, and the Dinner resturants were all well staffed and friendly,with plenty of selection for all picky eaters.The Beach was beautiful and white, and we had no problem finding shade, even after lunch, without going down to reserve chairs.The Pool was perfect, if you don't like salt water, and the free flowing shape is very pleasing to the eyes.Our room was always clean and tidy, and if you leave a little tip on the pillow every morning that extra little effort is put in by the staff for you.It was a wonderful stay and I would go again!!!!

<Content>Nice resort but not a 5* resort Stayed at the Majestic for 10 days. It is a beautiful resort with nice rooms but cannot give it 5*. See klhoek review for a detailed review. Booked through cheapcaribbean and got a good price and it included an upgrade to a majestic suite (pool side room with outdoor jacuzzi). Airport-ArrivalJust get in line, pay your $10 and get your tourist card, stay in line, go through immigration, walk towards baggage claim where they take your tourist card. The walk from baggage claim to the tour buses is a short distance so tell the guys no or they will grab for your luggage.Airport-DepartureWhen you get to the airport, the bus pulls up and they start unloading the luggage onto the curb while the guy on the bus is telling you goodbye and where to go. The guys already have their hands on your luggage waiting for you when you get off the bus. Here you even have a shorter distance to walk to the counters then when you arrived. If traveling to the US, you have to get in a separate line to have a quick inspection for food and other prohibited agricultural items. Then you get in line to check your luggage. Go through immigration again, then security and wait for your flight.ResortIt was beautiful. One of the nicest resorts I have stayed at in the Caribbean. Upon check-in, did not receive my upgrade to a majestic suite but they said check back tomorrow. Put in building 3 on the 3rd floor. Very limited view of the ocean but it was only for one night. That night got stuck in the elevator for 15 minutes. No air conditioning so it was like a sauna. Next day received the majestic suite so no more elevators for the remaining 9 days. Housekeeping was hit or miss for the entire stay so an area for improvement.BeachThe beach area is beautiful with plenty of chairs and some in the shade. The water is clear but there are many spots with coral on the bottom instead of sand. Plenty of sea urchins in the coral. Get snorkling in the water and you will see what I mean. The current is rather strong here also. Went on a snorkling trip to the marinarium and the water has a lot less coral and there was almost no current. If you have small kids who play in the water, you may want to stay at a resort closer to the airport because of the condition of the water.FoodFood was good especially breakfast at the main buffet. Steakhouse was good as was the Japanese. Chinese was bland and service took forever. Gourmet was also good. After reading some of the reviews I wasn't sure what to expect but the chicken was delicious and it had the best service of all the restaurants. Lunch was at the beach buffet. Same food everyday, hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, pasta station and some hot dishes that did change. It would be nice if they served pizza at this location instead of just at the main buffet. Never got sick on the food or drinks but stuck to the filtered water or the bottled water.DrinksOne word. Bubbakeg. Had a 52oz bubbakeg and was worth it. Otherwise, the little 8oz cups are to small if you are at the beach most of the day and would have to make several trips. The majestic drink is very good also.ScubaI received my scuba certification while at the majestic. Glenn is a great instructor. It takes 4 days so be prepared. First day is watching an instructional video for 4-5 hours. Second is testing, paper and in the pool for several hours. Third and fourth days are two dives a day (4 total). Well worth it. There are some great dive sites just off the beach and south of the wreck Aston. Saw a turtle and a barracuda. Others saw a moray eel plus many different types of fish. The only complaint is the boats they use. It is an oversized rowboat but with an engine and storage for dive tanks. They expect you to jump, swim or pull yourself into the boat after a dive. I had to request a ladder which is an old rusty thing they hang off the side and is not stable. They also beach the boats for you to get on and off. Some of the other resorts use scubacaribe as their water sports company. We went by their boats and I was jealous. Nice catamarans with seating for 12 and 2 fixed ladders for getting back aboard. The majestic needs to insist upon better boats for scuba diving because they cannot compare to the catamarans. Other people who were there to dive also noticed the difference in the types of boats and were not happy.Overall a nice resort but not up to a 5* rating.

<Content>Great Resort! Me and My Wife stayed at Majestic Colonial June 1-6. Airport: Had a great experience both ways. Thought the Punta Cana airport was nice. Much nicer than Miami, where we changed planes. Check In: When we arrived at the Majestic, we were immediately greated with cold towels and a Majestic Drink. Front Desk staff was excellent, Oscar (Rooms Division Manager) showed us where to make restraunt reservations, and gave us a short tour while walking us to the room. Room: We stayed in 1407, a Colonial Jr Suite. The room was excellent, we had a large patio with a private jacuzzi. The room was large and the mini bar was an excellent feature to have. The open concept of the bathroom was not a problem at all for us, but I could see how it could be an issue if you were traveling with kids.Food: The food is by far the hardest part to review. We had some excellent meals, and some not so good ones. I am a very picky eater though. I think the thing to remember is that the food is different than the US. If you remember this when setting your expectations, you will not be disappointed. Teppanakki (sp?) was by far the best meal we had there. It requires reservations, so make sure you try to make them when you arrive. Even if you can't make reservations, you can go to the restraunt at the seating time and see if anyone cancelled there reservations. A couple we met did this and was able to get in when we went without reservations. Pool: The pool is the best feature of the hotel. It is the length of the interior of the resort and has two bars. It is large enough that you can tailor your experience based on what you feel like doing. There are plenty of quiet areas where you can enjoy a good book, or active areas where you can participate in the events with the animacion team. We spent most of our time at the pool. Beach: I prefer the pool to the beach, but the beach was wonderful. White sand and turqouise water. The times we did go out there, we were allways able to find a spot. Bars and Nightlife: We never saw a show in our time there, not our thing. Most of our nightlife was spent in the Sportsbar (Air Conditioning). The staff in there were great. Taison, the manager was excellent and knows how to make sure everybody is having a good time. The bartenders at the main bar were great too. Staff: As stated in some of the prior reviews, the staff was hit and miss at times. The hits from the staff outweighed the misses by a lot though. I'd say that most of the misses could be attributed to the language barrier and the staff not completely understanding what we wanted or needed. Oscar was definitely one of the good ones, and went to lengths to ensure our stay was wonderful. Overall: We had a great time and would reccomend this resort highly. For a point of reference, this is only the second all inclusive we have stayed in, with Sandals Grande Antigua being the other. Valuewise, this was a much better trip than our trip to Sandals. And we definitely regretted only staying five nights.

<Content>Awesome Getaway This was our second trip to DR , but our 1st to the MAJESTIC and it was awesome. My wife and I stayed at GRAND PALLADIUM BAVARO last year which was a romantic stay. We came back with our 2 children ages 15 and 12 and 6 other family members. The Majestic was great fun. The staff was amazing my wife and sister in law loved Ray and friends. The food was really good and plentiful compared to last year. The resort was very clean and landscaped beautifully. We never had problems with housekeeping or any one else for that matter. I feel the resort is perfect in size easy to get around. A big difference to our last stays at other resorts was that the beach was not so crowded and you did feel crowded. The lobby could use a some good ceiling fans like the airport but hey the seabreeze was great. So if you want a great allaround resort I would recommend it highly and we will be back not soon enough lol. If you get the chance take a few excursions like Bavarro Runners and the Isle Siona theey are awesome and entertaining

<Content>Completely Overrated - NYC, NY Was very disappointed with this hotel, I basically booked based on reviews here, which I've done in the past, but I found them off the mark this time. Punta Cana beaches are beautiful  easy to get to from NYC, so we'll be back, but would not stay here again. We stayed at the Sol Melia a few years back  it was MUCH nicer.Overall, the place was showing some serious wear  tear. We got stuck in the elevator one night, the landscaping was shoddy, the pool was looking dingy /dirty around the edges, etc. The rooms were nice, although the couch in ours was disgusting, I wouldn't sit on it. The food was beyond terrible. I've eaten at some bad buffets, but this was the worst I've ever seen. The salad bar was tiny, and who wants to eat hot pasta when it's 95 degrees out? The Dominican restaurant was the best out of the lot, but not great. Don't bother ordering wine (a la carte), they must not keep it correctly because the 2 times we tried it, it was terrible.The plus is that we always found a shady spot at the pool  there were plenty of spots at the beach, which is really what mattered to us.After walking down the beach  checking out other places (and staying at the Sol Melia in the past), we know that there are much nicer spots in Punta Cana. Don't waste your time on this one.

<Content>Even Better the Second Time! Just got back from an incredible 11 day vacation at the Majestic Colonial Resort! This was our second trip to MC. We were there last June as well. Everything was so much better this time. The food quality has improved on the buffets. Breakfast buffet has an amazing variety of foods, fruits, breads, etc all very fresh and delicious. (The warm croissants are amazing!) The beach restaurant is a nice choice for lunch, with burgers, hotdogs, papa fritas (fries), paella, pasta station, salads and more. The resort is breathtakingly beautiful. They do a great job keeping the grounds clean and tidy. The people are very friendly and always accommodating. We received excellent service the entire time. The best of MC . . .The Pool - unbelievable - you can stay in the pool all day. One end is quieter with a nice hot tub area. The other end has entertainment and activities and a swim up bar. There is also a pool in the spa.The Restaurants- So many different choices and all of it is good. We loved the seafood restaurant -great grllled lobster! The Chateaubriand at the Steak restaurant is delicious!! We hightly recommend the Cooking Show at the Japanese Restaurant - Great food and a lot of fun!! The beach Clean, Large, beautiful water, many aquatic activities.The Kids ClubWe are a couple with two children (ages 4 years old and 11 months old). Our four year old absolutely loved the kids club. He went everyday for a few hours. They have an amazing program for the kids that goes from 9 am to 6 pm. The kids club area looks like a castle with it's own pool and two water slides. There is a beach area with sand and palapas and beach toys. They also have toys, videos and video games inside. We spent the mornings together as a family and our son went to the KC in the afternoons. He loved the waterslides and the pool, so much he never wanted to leave. He also loved Maggie (the kids club coordinator). She was always happy and kept the kids engaged. MC definitely has the right person in the KC. She was so much fun and very responsible with the children. She even remembered our son from last year. We felt very safe leaving him and he had a blast. The peopleWe loved the friendly staff. Everyone went out of their way to give good service. There were moments when language was a barrier, but they are always polite and kid.Wish we never had to leave!!One Con . . .The area around the pool has many potholes in the cement. Can be uncomfortable if barefoot. This was the only maintanence issue we observed.We're already planning next year's trip!!

<Content>Majestic Rocks! This was not only my first vacation since 1990, but it was my first time out of my country and the first time I have ever traveled alone.I chose to stay at the Majestic Colonial Resort in Punta Cana and my time there will be a memory cherished. About the hotel鈥?.It was stunning! The rooms were large, romantic and clean. Each suite had its own Jacuzzi tub, which room service delightfully filled with sudsand beautiful flowers on my first day. Each room had its own bottle of wine to greet its guests and a stocked fridge with all your favorite soft drinks. The food was excellent and for some reason I felt better than usual there and the food never upset my stomach. My guess is there food is more freshly prepared and does not contain all the chemicals that we are forced to eat in the states. There was also soooooo much food to choose from so many different restaurants鈥?It would be nice to just live there on the resort.It was a little difficult being there alone, though I liked the attention that I got from the locals. There was always something to do or you could just choose to relax. Being there alone and a lil bitshy鈥?I chose to relax a lot. However, if it were not for the Animation Team, I probably would not have enjoyed my trip as much. They were always around, getting involved with the guests, playing games, dancing with us in the disco, and making sure that everyone was enjoying themselves. I would like to add that I made some cherished friends鈥?.My very very special friend Pablo, and Samuel kept me dancing, and playing. These boys and girls of the Animation Team are a huge asset to this resort. I just love them all. I also made a very beautiful friend at the gym, Ezequiel, who gave me special attention, and got me set up with a core workout routine. He was a great friend to me while I was there. He is another great asset to the resort.Actually everyone there was very friendly and would go out of their way to please. Every night they had shows. Some were really good, some well鈥︹€?though they had potential were in need of a lot of help and were a little painful to watch. Overall, I would definitely go again, even if only to see my new found friends again. The only thing I don鈥檛 like is the no fraternizing rule, because being single and alone I really wanted to meet, and make friends with the locals and learn the culture. The only suggestion I have for the hotel specifically would be FANS Put fans in your lobbies and your restaurant at the back of the resort. It gets terribly uncomfortable for your guests and the employees.My suggestion to all the hotels in the area would be to take care of a larger portion of your beaches. Make it your mission to take care of your island, to keep it beautiful beyond the resorts.

<Content>Our perfect wedding @ the Majestic! **********************************************WOW!****************************************************** This was an amazing resort. The beach, hotel, and staff were incredible. There is nothing not to like about this resort.  The Buffet has everything! Even the hardest to please will find something to enjoy. The Steak house is to die for. We have never had steak like that before. We found ourselves going back again and again!  Always something to do. Daytime activities by the pool, many evening shows and disco. All were amazing! The evening shows weren't very exciting, we found ourselves spending time at the poolside lounge instead. The resort is very large and therefore finding a quiet place to relax is never a problem. Aurelio was great. He is the man when it comes to weddings! He, and his staff made every detail perfect. My wife and I were very, very pleased. We had our special day in the gazebo, and it was wonderful! Zero compliants. You can rest easy if you chose the Majestic for your special day. The onsight photographer is a little pricy, but after you see his work you will understand why. Our photo's are amazing! We have recieved more compliments on them then you could ever imagine. Our reception supper was at the Steak house and it was perfect. The staff waited on us hand over foot. We wanted for nothing. Before you could ask for another drink it was at our table. Our day was the best. Infact the only thing more beautiful then the Resort was my Bride! We traveled with 22 friends and family, many first time travellers and no one was disappointed. I am sure they will all return to the Majestic sometime in there lives. Yes they are that good. They deserve the five star rating and then some. The only bad thing about the whole trip was our air carrier. Sky Service left a very bitter taste in our mouths. Our flight was dealyed nearly half a day. This caused a very late arrival at the Resort and the loss of a full day of our vacation. I have sent a letter to the company and still have yet to recieve any response to our concerns. My wife and I will never travel SkyService again.  Remember that this is a very poor country. They are also very accustom to begging the tourists for anything and everthing. They will try to take the shirt off your back! They are very needy but do not give them money, instead consider giving to a local charity in the area. They do a lot of good for the children and the education process there. They are people helping their people. It seems like the best way to lend a helping hand. Thanks and hope you enjoy your stay at the Majestic, you will love it!

<Content>Beautiful, but hard to understand! After reading all the reviews listed at this site and getting a special upgrade offer, we decided the Majestic Colonial would be an ideal place to spend our week-long vacation in Punta Cana. I noticed on the reviews that everyone loved the pool, but the food and staff got some negative remarks. I chalked this negativity up to high standards. First, the positives. The resort was beautiful. Nice landscaping, great pool, very nice rooms. We had two jacuzzi tubs (one inside, one outside). We were right by the pool, so we were able to open our patio doors, roll our lounge chairs to the edge of the pool and jump in..that was nice! They also had a variety of restaurants. You could always find a place to get a drink, if that's important to you.  Now for the negatives. The food at the buffet was ok. I'm a picky eater, so it was just a matter of finding what you like. But there were enough options at the resort that it really wasn't a problem. Yes, the mattress and pillows were pretty hard, again, not a big deal. We were awoken every morning by housekeeping. The front doors hardly kept out any noise; although you could barely hear anything from the patio or the other rooms?? They experienced brief power outages throughout the day. We would reset the alarm clock 3-4 times a day. The ocean was pretty rough in this area, but it was pretty enough to make you forget. My biggest gripe; however, was the language barrier. I understand that we are visiting an area that is Spanish-speaking and I am the first to give credit to them, because I figure they know more English than I know Spanish (I only took one year of Spanish, my boyfriend took two). However, the language difference was a huge problem here.  First off, our room keys worked, so we went back to the front desk and tried to explain...they didn't understand, but soon swiped the cards and sent us off again. Needless to say, it took four trips back and forth from our room to the front desk before they understood that the scratch on the back of the card is why the one card wouldn't work...that was nearly the beginning. Through out the trip we had a hard time relaying our message to just about everyone. We had a small leak from the ceiling in our room, which I alerted housekeeping about, because it was dripping onto the outlet. The first gentleman told the girl who cleaned our room...she brought bug spray. She later sent maintenance, who simply said no comprendo, eventhough he could see the leak. I inquired about a shopping center that opened in December with guest services. I wondered if there were many stores open there. All she kept responding was yes, it's Wednesday, they are open. Needless to say, we spent $40 on a taxi, only to find out there were only about 12 stores open. One night we decided to check out the light nite fast food restaurant. . We were the first ones in line, the gentlemen took my boyfriends order, but not mine. Then when I asked for a burger plain, he started spewing words and stormed in back. Later two coworkers came to see him and he turned around, pointed at us and yelled all kinds of words (probably a good thing, I couldn't understand). I so wanted to tell someone, but the problem was....noone would understand me. Time after time, language was huge issue. Even those people that did speak English, didn't seem to understand what it was they were saying. You could repeat the same words to them and they were confused. So after a week, I was very frustrated and didn't want to talk to anyone. Overall, the resort was very nice, but I wouldn't go back because I don't like feeling left in the dark.

<Content>Magical and Memorable Anniversary This resort is absolutely perfect in every way! The grounds are meticulously kept, the rooms are beautiful, the pool is beyond words, as is the unbelieveable beach. I have been to several beaches in Mexico and Hawaii and none are more beautiful than this one. The employees of the hotel are awesome, everyone is so friendly, even if they can't speak your language. They make you feel important and special, even if you are an average Joe like myself. Our favorite restaurant for lunch was the grand buffet - the coconut ice cream is unbelieveable. Favorite dinner spot was the steak house - better food than the French restaurant that you need reservations in. If I had one complaint it would be the entertainment - not in my taste but others seemed to enjoy it. This didn't affect our stay one bit. We loved every minute we were there and had a magical 25th anniversay celebration because of the Majestic Colonila!

<Content>Beautiful Majestic! We visited the Majestic from April 27th through May 03 of this year with our two children, ages 21 and 17. Everything was top notch and we were not disappointed in any way! We booked with our travel agent through GoGo Tours. Transportation from the airport was quick and trouble free and we arrived at the resort about 3:00PM. Our check-in at the Majestic was very fast.Rooms : We had two pool view suites on the 2nd floor. My husband and I had the end room directly across from the main building. Every night the jazz band and sax player were right outside of our balcony. The suites were lovely and sparkling clean. The shower was awesome! Beds were comfy and there were plenty of pillows. We had no issues with the open set up of the bathroom since my roomie was hubby. Kids did not have an issue either. Beach: The beach was to die for! Perfect, clean white sand and clear blue turquoise water. I did walk down to save chairs for us most days so we could grab some shade. Even if I didn鈥檛 save chairs there was always plenty of space. We walked on the beach everyday and it was interesting to check out the other resorts. From what we saw, ours was head and shoulders above the rest. Pool: Just spectacular! Also the entire pool is covered in tile so it is very easy on your feet, knees etc. Food: We found the food to be very good overall and plentiful. The breakfast at the main buffet was delicious! Made to order eggs and omelet鈥檚 tasty, plenty of fruit, baked goods and mimosa鈥檚 each morning. We also loved the Dominican coffee. We had lunch daily at the beach buffet and could always find something good to eat. For dinner we enjoyed the steak house and main buffet the best. We tried the Chinese, Mexican and seafood also. The food at the seafood restaurant was not great but I think their seafood is just different than we are used to. My son had two entrees on several occasions and the servers were always friendly and attentive. Drinks: Drinks were plentiful and not watered down. Presidente beer was pretty good and had a light beer taste. We found the drinks at the lobby bar to be the best. Juan the bar tender hooked us up with some awesome drinks and was loads of fun.We would definitely return to the Majestic again!

<Content>Love the Majestic! June 10, 2007 Just got back from a fun filled week at the Majestic! Our family (myself, husband, daughter 16 and son 12) fell in lovewith Punta Cana and the Majestic. A big shout out to Victorthe front desk manager! Even though the resort was at 90%capacity it did not seem crowded at all....no problem findinga chair at the pool or beach. The food was good-as all inclusives go-We ate at the French, steak house, seafood, and Japanese restaurants. The resort overall is very beautiful and immaculate. The rooms are nicely appointed and very clean. I particularly liked the marble showers...hot and great water pressure. The bed was softer than other placesI've stayed in the Carribean-table top hard beds seem to be the norm. The only negative about the room would be the musty, mildew smell. I would suggest bringing scentedcandles or odor eliminating sprays. Again, this is true of other hotels in the Carribean. I imagine the high humidity makesthis unavoidable. For excursions, I would highly recommendthe Outback Safari. In the most entertaining way you will learnmany things about the dominican culture, history, and people...not to mention the free flowing Dominican champagne...Danny Boy....you made our trip! It also helps to know a little spanish. I would recommendtaking lots of small bills for tipping (50-75 dollar bills). Even though tips are included at the resort , it helpsto show a little green. Having small bills also makes bartering easier.It's better to do souvenir shopping on the excursion. I packedan extra suitcase with things for the children at the local schoolson the Outback Safari. You can look at their website for a listof items needed. Overall, I recommend the Majestic and PuntaCana for your vacation destination.

<Content>Good Times in the DR This was our second trip to the DR, first time we visited Puerto Plata and have to admit that we were a little disappointed, however, we were willing to give the DR another try and boy are we GLAD that we did!! :o)We went to Punta Cana and stayed at the Majestic Colonial from May 23-28 for some rest and relaxation and to celebrate my birthday. The trip was fantastic!! We booked the trip through CheapCaribbean.com and could not of been happier with their service. Their price was fantastic and we booked during one of their promotions and got the free upgrade upon arrival so we had a jacuzzi in the room as well as one on the terrace and were only steps from the pool and we had the great lounge chairs so we never had to worry about having a chair at the pool. Great room!! We were in room 2144 and we were only about 30 feet from the pool bar....can't beat that!! Walk out your back door jump in the pool turn to the right and walk a few steps and there you were at the pool bar and where all the entertainment during the afternoon was, we couldn't of asked for a better location for our room. Plus, it was very nicely located near the beach too. As for the rooms....yes, the toilet area is a little akward with the door not going completely to the floor, but we are a couple who went and we didn't have a problem with it. I can see how that can get weird for some. The shower area is HUGE!! It was very nice. The sink area is nice too and double sinks so that is also nice when trying to get ready for dinner.The beds are a little hard and by the end of our stay we were looking forward to going back home to sleep in our nice pillow-top bed. Everything else is pretty standard...desk and chair. Small loveseat and a coffee table. We enjoyed both the jacuzzi indoors and outdoors, however being on the bottom floor there is not much privacy for the outdoor jacuzzi.They offer a safe to store your valuables that you set the code for and we used that and did not have any problems during our stay.The hotel staff were all very helpful and very nice. The CheapCaribbean representatives were also very helpful in the lobby and they even helped my boyfriend plan a surprise birthday cake for me on my birthday which I thought was a nice surprise and it just showed me that they were willing to go that extra step to make sure that we were happy with our vacation. By the way....the cake was so yummy!!The restaurants and food. Comparing it to the last time we were in the DR, the food at the Majestic Colonial is amazing!! Yes, there were dishes and things that we didn't like, but the best thing about staying all inclusive is that you can try something else. We really liked Taino (Dominican and Mexican food) and we ate dinner there twice. You do not need dinner reservations there so that is a plus too. We also really like Le Gourmet (french). Here you do need reservations and we made them when we arrived after checking in because you need your room number to make the reservation.The Steak House, located in the Palapa Hut on the beach, is good as well. We did not try the seafood restaurant or Matsuri. But, we did do room service on evening. I would not recommend it because the selection is not good and very small, it's best to get out and enjoy one of the restaurants and get the variety. Breakfast is better at the buffet up near the lobby of the hotel. They have everything that you can think of and could want. The breakfast that is offered at the Palapa Hut on the beach is not much of anything so if you are hungry get up early enough to hit the buffet.We did lunch at the buffet near the lobby (same one breakfast is served at) and at the Palapa Hut on the beach and they were both really good. Their deserts are also very good. I recommend these little coconut cookies....very good!!! Oh, and the chocolate cake....yummy.I think that even the most picky of eaters will be able to find something. I am one of those picky eaters and I ate well all week. Also neither one of us had any problems getting sick or anything else like that.Drinks: I didn't try anything that I didn't like. Everything was very good. You will get better or fancier drinks in the lobby bars than you will at the pool bar or at the bar in the Palapa Hut on the beach. We got absolute vodka at the lobby bars!!Spa: we got a couple massage and it was really good. Not sure it was worth that much $$ though. Last time in the DR only paid $45 for an hour massage...so prices at the spa were much higher at the Majestic.Beach: The beach is nice. There is some seaweed that can be gross at times, but it clears up in spots and just go there and swim. The water is clear and warm. The sand is white and never gots hot to walk on. There was always plenty of chairs and palapas to sit under. Nightly Entertainment and Excursions....can't really comment on these since we didn't do anything like that. We didn't go to one show in the evenings at the hotel we would rather hang alone or with the bartenders down at the Palapa Hut. We did, however, go to the shopping center at the entrance to the Majestic. They seemed to be overpriced and the prices at the hotel were just as good, if not better on things like t-shirts and things like that. Plus, you get hassled by the locals a lot there. I realize that they are just trying to make a living, but I would rather not put myself into that situation.A few cons.....we ordered room service our first night there and put the dishes in the room service closet and the dishes were never removed during our stay. We checked every day and it became a joke by the end of our stay to see if there were still there or not and even the last day they were still there. They should really watch that because uneaten food can atract bugs.The maids never changed our sheets and really didn't do a very good job at cleaning and there were some days when they would only leave us one towel. We did tip each and every day because I understand that they work hard and don't make a lot of money, but they could of done a better job. Also we made coffee and they never would take the dirty spoons that we would mix with....weird.Also we brought our own beach towels and had them on the back terrace drying over the chairs and on the last night there someone came and took one of the towels. I know....bummer. I chalk that up to it could of happened anywhere and at any hotel...I am just writing it down to warn you to maybe not leave your stuff out over night. Just be careful if you are on the bottom floor. Besides that we had no problems.Well....I think that is it and I hope that this review helps someone out there. All in all I thought that the Majestic Colonial was great. We had a fantastic vacation and would definitely go back there.Happy and Safe Travels!! :o)

<Content>Majestic in some ways!! First of all, let me say that the staff was pretty good, always saw a smile on them except for the management people though.After getting off the plane you have to pay the $10 tourist fee or whatever they call it there. When you leave the airport, please keep an eye on your bags because there are people trying to fight for them so that they can get a tip.The ride from the airport wasn't as bad as I thought it would be versus Jamaica. But the people there do drive crazy!! When we got to the hotel we were welcome with a refreshing drink and a cold towel. Checking in was easy but our room wasn't ready because we got there in the early afternoon.Room: The room was huge but nothing to WOW about. Bathroom is an open concept which mean there are no doors except from the frosted doors for the shower and toilet. If you want something in the room. Let's say towels or more water, tip the maid and put some in the fridge and it will be taken cared off. You will need the extra water because you cannot drink the tap water in the rooms (was not going to take a chance getting sick with brushing our teeth with the water either, so use the bottle water to brush your teeth)Pool/beach: It was wonderful, only 4 feet high throughout. The water in the pool was actually warmer then the beach!! The beach was kept pretty clean and you can snorkel there as will. There were some topless people there also. Food: Nothing too fancy but it was edilble. The Steak house was the best in my opinion. The buffet was pretty good considering it was an all - inclusive hotel (comparing it with Cancun). Food was always available. For the late nighters, there is a place for food until 6 AM.Excursions: We did to excursions. 1. The 1/2 day ATV was a must do excursion ( one in the morning and one during the afternoon). You are going to get dirty/dusty, so bring sunglasses and wear something cheap. In the middle of the ride you get to do turns and going thru big bumps/hurdles ( like motocross but smaller ).2. The Santo Domingo tour which is a whole day. 3 hours there and 3 hours back ( 6 hours total coach ride, bring a jacket because the bus is cold ). You get to see the largest city in DR plus you get to go see the amble museum, Columbus palace, tourist stuff, plus a little shopping. Lunch is included which is at the Hard Rock cafe.Also if you are planning to bring Mamajuanna back, make sure you fill it with rum or some sort of liquid and put it in your luggage. If not, they will take it away from you at the airport or make you fill them up. When you get to the airport, take you bags quick because people are fighting for them like crazy men!!! LOL They just want the tips but it's only 2 feet away, so you can do it yourself and save 1 or 2 dollars!!!! There are two lines, make sure you're in the right one. The first line is the pre-screen line which you have to go to first!!! You Do Not have to pay the $20 exit fee if you are US/Canadian citizens. Not sure about the others though.All in all, Majestic is pretty decent for the amount that we paid through Cheap Caribbean, no upgrade though, but the room was nice enough even without the upgrade.

<Content>Perfect!! Over Spring Break my friends and I traveled to the Majestic. It was the best vacation any of us have ever been on. Everything was perfect and we couldnt have asked for more. The food was delicious and there was always plenty to eat anywhere you went at any time of the day.The drinks were great too, and of corse free! Try the blue shots!The pool was unbeleavablely gigantic and amazingly clean.And compared to the other resorts around, the Majestic's beach was by far the best and cleanest.We made friends with all of the staff and after a few days they knew us all.The animation team was one of the best parts of our trip, they teach everyone their dance called the Taki Taki and make sure everyones havingn a good time. They were all so nice, and we will never forget them!The shows at night were incredible and afterwards dancing at the disco was a must.If you are traveling to the Dominican Republic the Majestic is deffinetly the way to go. And if you do go, say hi to Andre, Sandy, Ray, Rudy, Mariel, Water Aerobics Guy, Mi Amor and all the other awsome people that work there!

<Content>Great Time at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana We spent 6d/5n at this large, beautiful facility with our 6 year old son. It was very safe and comfortable at this location. It is a very kid-friendIy facility and the Animation Team, most especially MariaMagie at the Kid's Mini-Club, were excellent with him. We are fromthe USA - primarily English speaking, and on one day in particular our son was there with kids from other countries who only spoke Spanish. Maria assisted our son and made every effort to help him communicate and understand the language differences. Pool - I can't recall having seen a longer, larger pool anywhere I've traveled... it was terrific! The only drawback was that our room was close to the beach and there was only one towel hut that was in the center of the facility - and it was a huge facility so it took a while to walk and do towel exchanges every day. It would be nice to have additionaltowel huts at each end of the pool as well (remember I said it was a very, very long pool). The bars were well placed, the only deficiencywas that there wasn't one directly on the beach. Not that we're alcoholics - but as hot as it was, by the time you got back to your chaise lounge to enjoy what was your frozen drink - it was now liquidy and warm. Be sure to ask for a shot of additional rum as they were the typical frozen-machine selections and were very weak. Also, you were limited to 2 beers per day in the room mini-bar - why we'll never know! They were strick on that too (I tried to negotiate an additional few and lost). The beach bars were not well stocked, but the lobby bar had some top-shelf brands/selections. Another stange thing was that I had to enter my room number on a sheet each time I ordered a Grand Marnier (available only at the lobby bar) - there was no charge, so why did they ask for my number? The only bottled beer was the two-per-day in the mini-bar... none at the other bars (I can understand not having bottles at the pool bars, but why not at the others?). And, all bars only had one beer on tap - the brand was Presidente; a local brew I was told. It was an OK pale ale - and was better with a lime slice! Restaurants - We tried all of them except for Le Gourmet (no kids under 12 allowed - which was understandable to us). All of the others we tried were fine. That's to say that there were sufficient menu selections and we were successful in finding food that was between satisfactory to above average at each. The fruit everywhere was outstanding! Room - it was very large, but we found that the lack of a wall separating the bathroom area was a little strange and sometimes uncomfortable. We didn't use the tub as it was in-between the two sinks and the bed - wide open in the middle of the room - also a little odd we thought. Room service was nice except that the towel distribution varied - some days we didn't get wash cloths (which we both use). Entertainment - they had good shows and a nice variety. The only drawback was that some of the shows were scheduled a little late in the evening for our son to fully enjoy - for example the circus started at 10:00 PM (22:00 hours). It was hot and humid during our first week of June stay and that made it a little uncomfortable in the outdoor theater - which is where the shows were held. It is a huge theater with a very tall roof and open-air sides...they should have ceiling fans to move the air - not only to comfort the guests, but also help cool down the entertainers. We would recommend this facility to our family and friends. P.S. If you walk just outside theentrance to the flea market, be prepared to be EXtremely hounded by the merchants - more so than what we experience anywhere else we've traveled. We never did get to all the stores as we made a few quick purchases and quickly headed back to the hotel!

<Content>Hot In Punta Had a great time, very clean, very friendly. Food was good but not fabulous, there was plenty of it so you won't go hungry. Lots of bars but somewhat limited on choices. You will recieve great service whether you tip or not.Casino was very small and limited on games, so if gambling is important to you this is not the place to go. The casino was also the only place we felt the staff was not very friendly for some reason. We went to the casino more than once and felt the same about the staff. Overall great resort and well worth it for the cost. We would go back again.

<Content>food stinks We recently returned for an anniversary trip and were somewhat disappointed with the Majestic. This is hardly a 5 star hotel. The service is adequate but not very helpful or friendly. The room is nice but freezing cold air conditioning and very musty. The food was the biggest disappointment. The salad bar was terrible. The fruit didn't even taste as fresh as other caribean islands. Most choices were greasy or fried. The steak house and the japanese were good. My husband got very ill after eating at the Gourmet. The drinks are mostly all premade which stinks. Overall this place is alright but I would certainly have lower expectations compared to previous reviews. The pool and beach are excellent but would not return.

<Content>Just ok... My fiancee and I visited the Majestic Colonial on May 23-28, 2007. We had some good/some bad experiences....Pros...The Beach: its beautiful!!!! a little rocky but not much. The Room: the jacuzzi tub was nice and the shower was big.Food: We liked the French restaurant and the Steak House.Excursion: we took the monster truck to the country side. it was a great experience. we got to see how the locals live. if you go, make sure to bring things for the children there. The Service: the cheapcarribean employees were very helpful, most bar tenders where pleasant especially the ones near the beach, most employees did not speak english Now... The Cons...The Room: It smelled really musty, the bed were uncomfortable (very hard), the sheets were close to sand paper, when we checked in we were suppose to get a free upgrade but they actaully downgraded our room (although it was fixed after i had to ask for the manager)Excursions: we had a very bad experience- we went on the atv trip and stopped at a small place to get something to drinks. we were the only americans on the trip. there were 5 people before us that left without paying (the person at the counter did not charge them) and he expected us to pay. so we gave him a 20 dollar bill the drinks were 6 dollars and he tried to give us 7.50 us dollars back. so we told him he owed us more and he did not have the change so he expected us to just take the 7.50 and leave!!!! if he charged the other people, maybe he would have change.

<Content>Still trying to figure out how it got a 2007 travel award! We stayed at the Majestic from May 23-June 3, 2007. I am still trying to figure out how it was rated 2007 travel award. Seriously, i stayed in punta can 2 other times and this was rated 3rd. The Iberostar bavaro was excellent and the other was the Melia. This came in 3rd place. Food wasnt so great and the grounds were not anything great. Not much music going on in the day or activities. Would not recommend this hotel although if this is your first time at a resort in punta cana, you may like it but there are definitely others out there better than this.

<Content>loved this resort This was the first time traveling to the Dominican for me and my husband. We stayed at the Majestic Colonial on our honeymoon and loved it.They had very clean rooms and restaurants, and the pool was kept extremely clean.They had tons of activities going on during both the day and night so there was always something to do or watch.The only negative comment I have is that the beds are very firm.

<Content>Some +'s, Some -'s My husband and I went for our 1 year anniversary to the Majestic Colonial from 5/28 to 6/1. There were definitely some pluses and minuses from this vacation.We arrived at the Punta Cana airport and took a taxi ride to the resort. I was told this was better than taking a shuttle, as the shuttle has multiple stops before Majestic and could take up to an hour to arrive at the hotel. There is no line at the airport for the taxi ride, and it takes about 30-35 mins. Cost is $35 US dollars.When arriving at the resort, we were given cool towels but no drinks. I read some people got cold drinks as they arrived but we did not. We got to the reception desk to check-in and we were helped by Jenny who normally works at Guest Services, but was filling in at the check-in counter. She put the gray bracelets on for us and told us room service was included with these bracelet. Due to this, we ordered room service all week and found out at check-out that this was false information. I'll get to the details of this later.We get to our room and got 2 double beds instead of 1 king size bed. We called the front desk and they told us they will call us back in 5 mins. We waited in the room for their callback for 15 mins before calling them back. They put us on hold and told us they are switching our room and the bellhop will come by and take us to our new room. It took them 30 mins to finally come and take us. We wasted so much time on getting the room situation straightened out. I was not pleased.Rooms: The bathrooms have NO privacy. Unless you're 100% comfortable with the people you are staying with, do not share a room. Since it was only my husband, I did not care, but the toilet area is VERY small with no lock on doors and no privacy to toilet or shower. Also, we saw little ant-like insects crawling around our sinks all week. I think I killed about a hundred of them during our stay. Food: We tried making reservations at Matsuri but was told they are all booked during our stay. They suggested us going there early and taking places of people that do not show up for their reservation. Luckily, we were able to do that and the food was GREAT. Steakhouse was really good, Chinese was good, the Buffet was super. Overall, the food was wonderful. We really enjoyed every restaurant there, but we are not pick eaters.Beaches and Pool: BEAUTIFUL! There was never any problems getting chairs at either places. We got unlucky with the weather as it was only sunny for a few hours early in the day, then rained most of the afternoons and nights.Shows: The shows we saw were - Ideal Couple, Circus Show, Mr Majestic and the Magic Show. All shows were entertaining in a cheesy kind of way. I enjoyed it more than my husband did. Oh, and also, we got TONS of bug bites while watching the shows. Make sure you take bug spray if you go.Service: We encountered some really good service and some really poor service. Some bartenders were really nice and some just did not seem to care. We still tipped $1 for every drink. Take plenty of $1 bills for tips. We tipped normally $1 per drink and $2 - $5 per meals. Most people do not tip but we could not help it, they do work hard.Casino: I normally play blackjack but there were only 3 blackjack tables. Don't expect too much from the casino, it's VERY small with limited seats if you go late at night. We always stopped by after the nightly shows and it got pretty crowded. Also, I'm not sure if the dealers do this on purpose or not, but they mess up A LOT. You have to watch them carefully, as I caught them several times messing up on our pay.We did not do any excursions because of the bad weather. It basically rained most of the days we were there, except for the first and last day. BOO :-(Check-out: We got into a heated argument with the hotel management and because of this incident, I will never go back to Majestic again. During our check-in, Jenny (who normally works at Guest Services) told us room-service was included with our all-inclusive package. As she was putting the supreme gray bracelet on us, she told us that that was the highest level bracelet and that all room service was included. Because of this my husband and I decided to take advantage and order room service during the rainy afternoons. When we were checking-out, we were told that the room service was NOT included with the gray bracelet and we owed over $100 US dollars. I spoke to 2 different supervisors there (Francisco and Victor) who both told us that we should've double checked and told us we had to pay up. I told them Jenny told us room service was included, and they're response was there is no Jenny that works here. There is 1 Jenny at Guest Services. We tried telling them that was the correct Jenny that helped us check-in, but they didn't do anything about it. They looked at us like we were liars. They did not seem to care and did not even try to handle the situation correctly by getting Jenny to come over and talk to us. SO, I had to walk all the way to guest services myself and bring Jenny back. They basically told us that Jenny did not know the correct rules and told us false information, but that it was our responsibily to double check. We were furious, and about 30 mins of arguing with them we noticed lines starting to form behind us (usual check-out time). They FINALLY decide to credit us the money but they were not happy with it. I feel like the only reason they decided to credit us the amount was because they did not want us to make a scene in front of other guest. Our stay at the Majestic Colonial was just OK but we left with a lot of anger. I was furious at how they treated us while we were checking-out. It's funny how one incident can totally change your mind about the place.

<Content>Awesome Place!!! I went with my boyfriend for days (from May 23rd-June 1st)...it was a great trip all around from start to finish...we got upgraded to an ocean view which had a jacuzzi inside the room and outside. We had direct access to the pool and to the beach grill...I wouldn't of paid for it but ask nicely (like we did) and they might give it to you!The food was excellent in my opinion. I read the mixed reviews but you aren't going to be able to please everyone all the time...must try the churrasco at the steak house. It's delish. The seafood place was so/so...I wasn't impressed. Make reservations for both the Japanese place and the French place as soon as you get there as they sell out really fast! At Le Gourmet make sure to order the pumpkin soup (omg! so good) and the chocolate dessert (I put on 7 pounds on my stay!!!) The buffet is good...but make sure for breakfast you get there before 10am...because they do close!!! And then you have to wait until 12:30pm for lunch (one of the only drawbacks of this place)...Daily activities were fun...always a party at the pool by the swim up bar...get towels as soon as you can...because they are FAR from the party area. The nightlife was ok...the performers work hard and the Michael Jackson show was great...the club (if you can call it that) was usually dead by 12am. But if you want to hit up a popping club then you need to take a $15 cab ride to club Mangu. The casino...where to begin...my boyfriend and I LOVE to gamble. We play blackjack. The odds are NOT in your favor at this casino...the girls who work there NEVER smile and actually get mad (suck their teeth) if the table does well...my man and I were convinced that they must get a cut ...anyway...they don't check to see if they have blackjack so if you have 21, you may still lose. ALWAYS COUNT YOUR CARDS! they are quick to take them off the table along with your money (even if you pushed)...so stay alert and aware. Also, if you have blackjack you CAN ask for even money (they won't tell you that)... We ended up doing really well there (surprisingly)...but you meet some great people playing (HEY JACKIE FROM ATL!!!! and Fah from Canada (eh?)As for excursions...we went on the party festival boat that takes you snorkeling, then swimming with sharks. It was awesome. For $80 per person, an experience of a lifetime! As for buying things on the premisis...you can haggle a little...but just outside the hotel down the road there is are shops where you can haggle more. All in all, it's a great trip. I don't recommend it for singles, as it was more a couple place...but still, I can't imagine anyone NOT having a great time at the majestic colonial punta cana. Any questions, email me at highblueeyes@yahoo.comI will be glad to help!Leah

<Content>Not so relaxing vacation I stayed at the Majestic for 5 days, and like everyone else I chose this resort because of it's review. Let me start with the good. The grounds are beautiful, the staff(not including management) are amazing. The rooms are also great.Now the bad. Our room key didn't work on 3 occasions, due to no battery. Luckily there was a maintanece man who broke into our room and almost broke his neck. That cost us a 10 dollar tip. After a long night at the disco no one wants to wait in front of thier room for 30 minutes in the heat at 3 am. Mangement should of had the problem fixed when we first complained instead of giving us keys that did not work. This problem was brought to the attention of the public relations desk and they simply said these things happen. Our room then got flooded due to the rain coming in to through the bottom of the door, some of our things were near the door and where ruined. Went to the front desk hoping that they at least would offer to wash the cloths that were soiled. They simply said they are working on making the problem better that obviously didn't help my situation. Lastly we made reservations to the French restaurant, which men must wear pants to. I called public relations to ask if nice shorts were ok for men since the pants were runied in the flood and they said sure. Needless to say we get to the restaurant and we are not allowed in, I call the public relations person and they apologized for giving me the wrong information. They failed to ask me if I was inquiring about men or women dress codes. The manager also insulted us by suggesting that we eat next door. At this point I was fuming.I had my cloths runied and was humiliated at a restaurant. They tried to make up for it with a fruit plate the day I left. Sorry, but that ain't gonna cutting it. It is a shame that the management relies on the staff to make the stay pleasent, mangement (Laura especially from the PR desk and Victor from reception) takes no responsibilty for what went wrong. If you want to get treated with any type of respect stay away from this place. I left feelig like my money was wasted, regardless if the grounds were nice the food and higher up were a waste of my energy. I also feel very bad for the staff because they make no money and work so hard, it's pretty depresssing.If you do go to the Magestic just hope that you do not have any minor issues, because no one will care.

<Content>Perfect holiday I just got back from a one-week stay at the Majestic and it was just a perfect holiday! I am really glad I chose this hotel because I got to see a few other ones during my stay and it was by far the best one. The grounds are just so beautiful: the room is incredibly comfortable and clean, the pool is amazing (I realized after 2 days there that it stretched even farther than I thought) you can swim through it for hours and the beach is just paradise. Although the weather was not great (it rained for 2 whole days :-( and was mostly cloudy the rest of the stay ), it was still wonderful to just sit there and enjoy the view, especially since it is so spacious that you feel alone in the hotel most of the time. The food was good and I felt I never ate twice the same: I especially recommend the beach restaurant for lunch, to be able to enjoy the wonderful sight as you eat. It turns into a pretty great steakhouse/seafood place at night.Travelling solo to Majestic, I was scared I would get bored very quickly but the animation team was quite amazing, especially during the dancing lessons and at night at the disco. So you can manage to relax and have lots of fun at the same time... The only thing that didn't work for me was the special shows like MJ, international dance and circus which I thought were beyond average. I had much more fun with the shows held by the animation team where they interacted with people from the audience (cheers to you Scoubidoo wherever you are!) .Finally I recommend going to the Santo Domingo excursion, where you get to see some countryside during the 3 hour trip and then visit some of the historical landmarks of the DR. So that you don't feel just like a tourist locked up in a fancy hotel.I will go back to Punta Cana as soon as I can (see you next year as the customs officer said!), and most definitely to the Colonial Majestic...

<Content>Nie trip to Majestic Colonial We just returned from a 7night stay (5/23-5/30/07) at the Majestic Colonial. Let me preface this review by stating that this was our 4th AI vacation, and give our vacation background: We honeymooned in August 2003 at Sandals Antigua, and have vacationed the past 2 springs in Cancun at the Iberostar Paraiso Maya (2005) and Secrets Exellence Riviera Cancun (2006). All of these properties have been rated as 5 or 5+ stars on all travel websites that I have visited. Given our vacation history, I cannot rank the Majestic as a 5star resort. It was a nice resort, and there was nothing missing, but after visiting superior properties, the differences were glaringly obvious. That said, we still had a wonderful time, and have no major complaints at all about or vacation.Check-in: Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted with the aforementioned cold towel and a Majestic. We arrived at a time when there were very few other people checking in or out, so were processed through very quickly. The front desk staff were very friendly. However, our room requests were not granted. We booked a Colonial Jr Suite, and I requested building 2 or 3, closer to the beach than the lobby. Therefore, I was very disappointed to discover we had been assigned room 1407. This room was in building 1, and was the Col Jr Suite closest to the lobby. I was even more disappointed upon arrival at our room to discover that both our balcony and terrace overlooked the neighboring property's parking lot. I have to admit that after all the research I did, and knowing which buildings I preferred to be in, that this room location was terribly disappointing, and probably to some extent tainted my view of our entire vacation (just being honest here).Room: Our room was very nice. We had a Colonial Jr Suite, which was on the top floor of our building. There were only 2 Col Jr Suites per block of rooms (and not all blocks had them). It was pretty much exactly as all the pics I saw. As our room was top floor, we had a vaulted ceiling (which was nice). The bathroom was as desribed, but the glass on the doors to the shower and toilet were longer than I expected and the frosting was completely non-see-through, so no problems there. The bed was very hard, and very uncomfortable. And the pillows a bit odd--1 wasn't thick enough, but 2 gave a bad crick in the neck. In addition to the regular balcony that all rooms had on the back of the room, we also had a private terrace with a jacuzzi tub on the side of the room. This was wonderful, and I am very glad that I upgraded for it. We used the terrace just about every day. I layed out topless a few times, as no one could see into our terrace. We also used the jacuzzi as a private pool, and filled it with cold water during the day if we were laying out on the terrace. Only used it as a hot tub one time in the evening, but still got good use out of it.Food/Dining: We did not have any stomach prblems at all (in contrast to our last 2 trips to Mexio). In fact, the breakfast and lunch buffets at the Supreme Buffet were some of the best that I have had at any AI! There were some hot food stations that stayed the same everyday (eggs, omlettes, crepes and waffles made to order for breakfast; pasta made to order and grilled meats at lunch), but the pre-prepared hot foods were different every day. My usual breakfast consisted of fruit and yogurt, 2 churros, and 1-2 crepes. The freshly grilled chicken and the rice option at lunch were always very good. On one of our last days there, I discovered that the chef could make pesto pasta, and it was great (especially when adding a scoop of the cream sauce). The deserts were surprisingly good on the buffet (which has not been the case at other AI's we have visited). Even hubby agreed that the chocolate cakes were some of the best we have had.Dinner was hit or miss. . . . Day 1: Matsuri. This was OK. I had lemon chicken (which was decent), hubby ordered seafood chow-mein, but got beef instead. Appetizers, sushi and deserts were fair.Day 2: Rodeo Steakhouse. We both got the Chateaubriand, which we both thought was the best meal we had while there. The steak was really, really good, while the side dishes left a bit to be desired. We had really great service here, especially from the wine/water guy, so gave him a tip as well.Day 3: Taino. We had really bad service here. No waiter for at least 10 minutes, and we got our food before anyone offered us a drink. This was also an odd set-up. They had a Dominican buffet set up as an appetizer bar, and you ordered off a menu that was Mexican, but it was Mexican unlike any other I have experienced. I actually thought the Dominican buffet was quite good, and should have just eaten that for my dinner--what I got wasn't very good at all. I would recommend that you try the buffet first and see if you can get enough to eat before ordering off the menu. The local foods were quite interesting, and surprisingly tasty.Day 4: Supreme Buffet. We were tired this day, and didn't feel like dressing up, so just went to the buffet. It was pretty much the same as lunch, plus a few additional appetizers and deserts. Still good, just nothing spectacular.Day 5: We were supposed to go to the gourmet, but our reservation got mixed up, so we went back to the steakhouse and got the Chateaubriand again. Just as good the second time.Day 6: Teppanyaki Grill. Great service, great show, great food. Sure, I know that I can get the same thing at home, so it wasn't anything special, but we both agreed that this was our second best meal at the Majestic. There was a nice appitizer platter, and you got TONS of food! The shrimp was a bit overcooked, but I was pleasantly surprised by the fish and beef. Day 7: Gourmet. Surprisingly, after our reservation snafu on sunday, we were able to get a reservation for our last night there without a problem. This meal took a while to serve (we were there for close to an hour and a half). The appetizers were a bit strange, but the pumpkin soup was fabulous. The puff pastry crust really makes it! We both had surf and turf (beef wellington with a little bit of lobster in the center of the roll). It was OK. Deserts were pretty good. Hubby had tiramisu, and I had the Majestic Pinapple which was kind of like a thick flavored creme brulee.Pool: HUGE!!! There was a place for everyone at the pool! Lots of chairs, so never had a problem getting a lounger. They have these little ledges all around the pool where you can lay, or move your chair so that your feet can dip into the water. These are very nice! The animation team was centered at the swim-up bar, so it was very noisy there, and something was always going on. Lots of drunk people planing games. LOL. After a day or two, we gravitated towards the quiet end of the pool. There was a bar there, too, although not swim-up. There were no servers delivering drinks to patrons at any of the pool bars, they were all self-service. The spa pool was also connected to (but separated by a partial wall from ) the main pool, and the water there was about 10-15 degrees cooler. They also had hot and cold (FREEZING, actually!!) plunge pools.Beach/Ocean: one word: WOW!!! The beach was gorgeous! The sand was powder soft, and the water crystal clear. There was not much seaweed at all while we were there (except for one day following a storm). You could walk the beach for hours! You can check out snorkle equipment at the beach, and the snorkling is actually pretty good. There is a rocky reef-like area just a few feet from the beach underneath the swimming bouy markers. Just take some bread from the breakfast or lunch buffet with you, and you will have all kinds of fish following you around! I had a school of about 100 fish following me around for at least 1/2 hour on our last day there!Shopping: There are a few stores on the resort where you can get some souvenirs. Some things are reasonably priced, others quite expensive. There is no bargaining. On Thursday nights, there a caribbean market is set up in the plaza. You can bargain with these guys. In fact, you pretty much have to, b/c there are no prices on any object. You just pick out what you want and they give you a price for it all. Their first offer will make you laugh. We were told not to pay any more than half of what you are offered. Same holds true for the shops at the shopping center out front of the resort. They will try to rip you off! Another bit of advice we were given is to offer the vendor a tip in exchange for a deep discount (he will only make a small fraction of the selling price in commission, and an extra few bucks from you will likely make him willing to sell to you cheap). This worked well for me at one of the stores.Clinic: Unfortunately I had to visit the medical clinic twice while there. Got water stuck in my ear due to excessive wax, and had to have it flushed out. The cost of the visits was a bit high, but the doctor was professional and very nice, and I was very glad to be able to hear again after several days of half-deafness.Excursions: We didn't leave the resort. We wanted to do one of the snorkle trips, but then I had trouble with my ear and was advised not to swim.Clientelle: While Cancun seemed to cater largely to North American tourists, Punta Cana seemed to be a very popular destination for European travelers. I would guess that less than 50% of the guests were English-speaking. There was a large contingent of French, German, and Spanish-speaking people. That said, there was also a LOT of topless sunbathers, especially at the beach. And not only sunbathers. . . .they loved to take walks on the beach topless, too. And, as my husband noted, the majority of topless women were older (over 50), and their parts were not attractive (so guys, beware. . . topless does not always = good! LOL).Language: We were also informed by our tour operator that education is not mandated in the Dominican Republic, and that a large number of native children do not even have access to a school. As such, grasp of English by the staff is not always good. This was by no means a problem for us, just be aware that many of them do not speak English at all.Tips/Suggestions: Bring your own washcloth. You may or may not be given one in the room. Bring your own bar of soap. The ones they leave in the room are TINY, and I didn't feel like I got clean when using them. Bring an insulated mug for the frozen drinks at the pool. They melt fast in those small plastic cups. Bring a pool float. I got ours at Walmart for $1.50. We didn' use it much, but it was nice to float on the really hot days. Bring lots of sunscreen and reapply twice as often as you think you should. I got burned on our first day after sweating off the sunscreen on my chest whan laying face down. Also be sure to lather up even on cloudy days. We saw a LOT of really badly burned people who didn't put on any sunscreen on a cloudy day. If you need change in US$, go to reception. If they cannot break your bill, try the porters--as they work for tips, they usually have small bills and can easily break 10s and 20s.Overall, I felt that this vacation was a great deal for the money that we spent. The resort was nice (although the grounds were not kept up as nicely as other resorts I have visited), the staff very friendly (especially Maximo and Lennin at Reception), the beach and pool beautiful, the alcohol always flowing. If I had not been to a 5+ star resort last year, I probably would have given this resort a higher ranking, but after going to a luxury resort it was easy to spot the difference. Nothing was missing or wrong with this resort, it just wasn't as sparkly/shiny and the service wasn't nearly to the same level as what we have experienced previously. That said, the resort we went to last year was quite a bit more expensive. . . . I guess you get what you pay for.Would I go back to the Majestic? Probably not. Hubby and I usually like to travel to different locations. However, we both agreed that we would be willing to go back to the Dominican Republic.

<Content>Amazing place We stayed at this hotel form 5/21-5/31. It was my first time booking such a long vacation, usually we only spend seven days. It's was our 4th time in D.R but first time at this amazing hotel. We traveled with my daughter who is only 3 years old and we absolutely loved kid's club and special thanks to Maria nad Maggie for their time and effort to entertain kids. The food was also very good, we always had a problem in Dominican, cause either me or my husband would get sick, but it never happened in Majestic. I appreciate all nice reviews that were given to this place before. It's definetely worth it.

<Content>Loved the animation team  My first time in Punta Cana was incredible. I had stayed at the Majestic and enjoyed every minute of it. I had gone with a large group for a wedding. The wedding was perfect and the rest of the week was an enjoyable vacation.I had shared a room with my sister and a friend that was clean and well kept. Our view from the terrace was beautiful especially first thing in the moring and late at night. It overlooked the pools and garden area. The beach, shows, restaurants, and the disco added to the alluring atmosphere of the Majestic.What I enjoyed the most about this hotel was the Animation Team. The ones that impressed me the most were ANDRES, JESUS, SAMUEL and REY. They entertained us with fun activities and exercise throughout the day and danced up a storm with us in the disco at night. They work long hours and still manage to keep smiling and entertaining us with their enthusiasm. We tourist appreciate them and hope that the mangement at the Majestic appreciate them as well and hope that they are rewarded accordingly. They all deserve a 100% raise...they are the BEST!!!! With all that said, I plan on returning for another amazing vacation to hang out with my favorite Animation Team. Keep up the great work!

<Content>Majestic is Awesome My wife and I spent our honeymoon at the Majestic from May 20 - 27. We flew in from Atlanta on Delta and getting through the airport was no problem. The baggage carriers are fairly agressive but a few firm no gracias and they will leave you alone. We went with 3 other people in a Turinter tours van directly to the resort where we were greetd with cold towels and a majestic. Our baggge carrier drove us in a van to our room which was 2142 and directly across from the pool bar and just 60 seconds from the beach. We were pleasantly suprised with the upgraded room which featured 2 jaccuzzis which we never actually used during our stay. Our room had a musty odor which never really left. I forgot the Fabreze but it was really not a problem. The room was absolutely gorgeous and the location perfect. For a cocktail I only had to walk 15 feet from the porch to the pool, hop in and walk another 20 feet. The grounds of the hotel are simply stunning and the beach is as fine as any in the world. Never had a problem getting a palapa, although I was usually on the beach by 7:30 each morning.Food: We were pleasantly suprised by the restaurants. The breakfast buffet is awesome with tons of items including passion fruit, mangoes, made to order omelettes, crepes, sausage, smoked salmon, mimosas and a variety of juices. Lunch at the main buffet was also very good and the pizza was excellent. The seafood restaurant was alos pretty good (we had the lobster) and the chateaubriand at the steakhouse was very good. I did not particularly like the chow mein at the Chinese restaurant but hte sushi was very good. I was also dissapointed with the Gourmet but I was rather full from lunch when we ate there so that may have influenced my opinion. Taino was very good (Goat stew was awesome) and I had a good red snapper dish off of the menu. My wife had the grouper which she also enjoyed. Last the Japanese restaurant was also very good with lots of shrimp, steak, chicken and salmon.Bars: The bars were all very good and I never had to wait very long for a drink. Brugal was only to be found at the lower lobby bar but I did not mind the Barcelo. They also had Stolichnaya vodka at all of the bars. I probably had well over 100 drinks during my stay and tried coco locos, pina coladas, daquiris, capirahnas, mojitos (excellent), cuba libres, banana mamas, bloody mary's, majestics and of course mamajuana and presidente.Pool: The pool was gorgeous and the water temperature was just right. You could walk the entire length of the pool in about 35 minutes at a leisurely pace, stopping for a cocktail or two at the pool bars. If you wanted to be around loud, silly drunk people just hang out by the main pool bar. If you wanted peace and quiet gravitate towards the beach end or the lobby side of the pool.Beach: Stunning. white sand, blue water and coconut palms everywhere. You will see topless women as well and I was suprised to see my wife topless after returning from the bar with a few drinks. There is coral on the left and right side of the beaches so watch your feet when you venture into the ocean. We went snorkeling one day and took a couple of rolls from the beach buffet and were swarmed by fish. It was not spectacular snorkeling but well worth the effort. The water temperature is perfect and a bit colder than I expected it to be. Shows: The shows for the most part were very good. I loved the Michael Jackson show and I cannot even stand him or his music. The dancers were awesome with Las Vegas quality talent. The circus was also unbelievable with one really talented and very strong guy who did amazing things on the ropes/trapeze. The 70s/80s rewind show was also very very entertaining.Casino: We never made it except a brief trip through it. We talked to numerous people who said they won there though.Disco: Did not make it ther either as we were to tired to go after drinking and being out in the sun all day.Shopping: Cigar shop at resort is a rip off (like $20 - 30 us for one cigar) as well as the convienence store there. We went to the shops off site (front gate) and were hassled to no end by shopkeepers. They will give you a free cigar and shots of mamajuana for free however. My advice is to barter to 50% of asking price. My wife got a Larimar/amber bracelet and larimar/amber earings, a bottle of rum, a pound of coffee and some post cards for like $50.00 US which I thought was apretty good deal. A similar bracelet in the jewelery store in the hotel was like $125.00 us.Excursions: We did the Saona Island excursion which we both enjoyed, although it took like 12 hours roundtrip. The catamaran ride was nice, the island had probably the nicest beach I have ever seen but be prepared to be hassled by pushy salespeople selling jewelry, coconuts and massages. The buffet on the island was also very good. On the way back they stopped at the natural swimming pool which is a knee to waist deep area about 1/2 mile off shore where there are lots of starfish. We found 4.Complaints: We only had three complaints and they were minor and in no way detracted from our experience. The first was that they advertise catamarans as being included. Well they are only if you have experience with them. If not they want to charge you $50 US for a lesson, which we thought was false advertising. Secondly, when using the internet cafe they charge $5 for 30 minutes or $8 an hour. If you go over your 30 minutes they will charge you an additional $5 unless you specify that you want a whole hour from the get go. Last, the henna tattoo lady tried to rip us off. She initially wanted $25.00 us for a small tattoo and my wife laughed and then she went to $15.00. Well we talked her down to $12 and she drew up the design and only included a portion of it (incomplete design). We walked away and she just sat there without any business for the rest of the afternoon when she could have made $12 for like 10 minutes work.All in all the Majestic was excellent. We never saw any bugs or mosquitos other than like 3 ants on our patio. The weather was awesome although humid at night. Without a doubt it is the nicest resort I have stayed at and we will definitely return for an anniversiary.

<Content>paradis My husband and I went with 16 other friends and stayed at the majestic hotel. As soon as we arrived we were given something to drink (as it was quite hot) and a cooling towel while we waited to check in. Now that was only the beginning as we stepped out of the bus. The rooms true to the pictures we have seen. We cannot beginning to say enough about the cleaniness of the room and also about the staff at that resort, never did anyone of us ever go without. The pool side staff alexandra,alexander,pablo,maria, ray,sandy and many others that constantly entertained us and provided us with lots of laughter and made it so memorable for us. we could hardly wait to go back, hopefully really soon.Highly recommend

<Content>An Okay Stay Stayed 5/6/07-5/14/07So this was my second time traveling to Punta Cana and I went with my mom who travels to the Dominican about 2 times a year. My family usually stays at the Iberostar resorts, however we read great things about this resort so decided to give it a try. We were travelling from Boston and had no problems w/delays or anything. As a tip, try to take some snacks with you as the airports are pricey. Hotel grounds: The grounds were very nice. The hotel is the perfect size, not too big or too small. Tons of bars. The only thing missing was animal life we had seen at the Iberostar hotels.Weather: We looked online for the weather and it said rain everyday. On our actual vacation we only had 1.5 days of rain.Room: We had room 3333 and it was great. Try to get rooms closer to the beach and further from the stage as it tends to be loud at night. The beds were comfortable. The TV channels seemed a bit limiting. The jacuzzi was amazing. The bathroom set up was weird and would have been a problem if my dad would have come with us. Service: The service at the restaurants was great. A bit too much even at times. We usually left a tip. I was very disappointed with the housekeeping. We like to go to the beach early, like at 8, and come back at 2. On our second day, we come back and the room still isn't clean. I called the front and told them to send someone earlier (in the morning) for the rest of our stay. So the next day she comes at 10, but the days after she would come at 4. Since this was inconvinient for us, she ended up not cleaning the room for 3 days. On our last day, as we were packing up to leave, now she comes early in the morning, trying to rush us out. Food: This was also a bit disappointing compared to Iberostar. We did not care much for the buffet. I'm used to things being cooked made to order and for the most part the dishes are made ahead of time and don't look so fresh. They also don't have a very good bakery. We ate at the Chinese, Gourmet, and Steakhouse. At the Chinese we had the sushi and the Mahi Mahi..very good. At the gourmet, the pumpkin soup..delish even though I don't like pumpkin, and the beef wellington, we really liked it here and went here 2 times. At the steak house, the chateaubriand and the shish kabob...this place was the best and we went there like 3 times. At the seafood we had the lobster which was disappointing, we also tried the calmari and shrimp since the portions were small and found them to not taste that good either. We didn't go to the Mexican because it didn't look fresh and we didn't care for the Japanese, we went to the steak house instead. Desserts were a bit disappointing at the resort except for the fried ice cream at the chinese and the tiramisu at the gourmet. Bars: These were very good and better than at the Iberoster. Try the dirty monkey, mudslide, and cosmopolitan. These drinks aren't too sweet, like the Majestic, and are just right.Shows: The shows were like those at Iberostar. I was impressed with the international show. Casino: The casino is small, but has 5 cent mashines, so for 2 dollars you can spend about 30 min there. Beach: The beach was very nice. We tried to go every day since this was the reason we came. Not too many waves and very spacious. Tons of palapas. It wasn't crouded like at other resorts and the water was great. The waves were just the right size.If I had a choice between this resort and Iberostar, I'd choose Iberostar, but if this resort was a better deal, I'd go here.

<Content>Just OK--totally honest opinion Having traveled to several countries I am well aware of the cultural differences in food, culture. However, I would have to say that that our time in the DR was just ok. I read the reviews on trip advisor and went there with an open mind since I know that you cannot please everyone. The hotel--A++ for the beauty of the grounds, the pool, the beach, the rooms and the overall layout of the resort. I have no complaints whatsoever about any of these. The pool is huge and VERY clean, the beach is stunning and VERY clean. The resort itself is gorgeous. No problem at all getting chairs, shaded huts, etc.The food--I'd give it a C at best. Trust me when I tell you that I was not expecting Amercianized food but even their local fare just was not good. I would say edible at best. Fruit--excellent--you can't go wrong here. Chatueaubriand was very good and the French Restaurant, while not spectacular, was by far the best. The Sushi at the Japanese place was also decent. The drinks are made with bottom of the barrell liquor. They have stoli IF YOU ASK but everything else is the cheapest available. My husband did get sick but I am going to chalk that up to too much alcohol and sun. But lunch at the beach restaurant is not good at all. There were clearly rotted vegetables, things that should have been kept cool just sitting out baking in the heat and not a great selection. Stick to the main lobby buffet. Service: F. The front desk staff was very good and helpful. Beyond that you are on your own. I was truly made to feel as though I was inconveniencing anyone else including the bartenders. They look at you solely as money and that's it. I am a firm believer in tipping as we are told these people are making $50-$60 a WEEK, however, I will not tip just because. At no point did I feel as though anyone was happy to serve. There is zero beach or poolside service. You have to get your drinks yourself.Entertainment B+. The entertainment staff DO work hard. The Michael Jackson show is by far the best I have seen at any resort anywhere. Shopping: F- If there was a grade lower than F they would get it. There is a shopping area just outside the resort. AVOID THIS. They hound you to point where you can't even LOOK. I understand they are trying to make a living but they are beyond agressive. We left after 10minutes because they do not leave you alone for 1sec. Pay a little extra on the resort and save the hassel of being harrassed. The main thing we didn't like is that we felt like we were in a prison. You cannot leave the resort under any circumstances unless you are taking a tour. You are hounded for money from the second you get off the plane to the minute you leave. It was a nice place to rest and relax but we will not return to DR.

<Content>Majestic Colonial beautiful My husband and I just returned from The Majestic Colonial. The resort is absolutely beautiful. The pool and the beach are to good to be true.We had room 1347 a beach front junior colonial suite. We had a hot tub on a very large balcony, also 2 chaise lounges and a table and 2 chair. The room was very clean. We tipped the maids daily and left a tip in the mini bar daily we got extra beer and water everyday. The air conditioning was weak. It never seemed cold enough. It shuts off if the balcony door is left open. The T.V. didn't work from wednesday to sunday complained 3 timesno one came to fix it.The food, we ate at every restuarant. Some are better than others it's all a matter of taste. I love the Rodeo (steakhouse) the best.Overall the place is beautiful and the people are fanstastic. But not a 5 star more like a 4.

<Content>Unbelievable Value Wife and I stayed at the Majestic 5/21-25 and loved it! This resort is a great value. We stayed four nights for around $1100 taxes and all including transport to and from the airport (which I recommend getting ahead of time, but NOT from Hotelbeds). I am not a cruise person and not really all about all inclusives because I'm a foodie. But I was pleasantly surprised with this place.The Food: none of the food is going to top the Zagat survey, but it is all pretty good and the breakfast buffet is excellent. My favorite thing was the Churrasco at the Rodeo Steakhouse, very authentic. The Japanese grill was neat to experience in a Latin country, but it was no better than a Benihana in my book. But that's a good thing, cause you would still drop $40 or more a head at a joint like that in the U.S., which is a steal at an all-inclusive. Le Gourmet, the French restaurant is pretty good. It was a big surprise to find that they did not enforce the dress code at all (people in nothing better than beach wear) and the service was probably the worst of all the restaurants, including the beach buffet. The food was impressive for an all-inclusive. If you are saving your dessert calories for one place in the whole resort, get them in at this place. The Tiramisu is very good but the Chocolate Fondant is out of this world, among the best I've tasted. The lunch buffet in the main hall is OK, the pizza's not bad and everything else is average. The beach buffet I wasn't too big on, eventhough we had it two or three days for lunch. It was more cafeteria style food. We did not try the Chinese part of Matsuri but we heard a lot of people saying it was not good at all. Taino, the Latin place, was pretty good. I recommend the stews, both the Dominican and the Goat were great. The Fajitas were what you would get at any shopping center Mexican joint in the U.S., not bad and not great. The only complaint I have is the time some of these places opened. Nothing was open from 10 until 12:30, so you have to schedule your day around lunch or eat breakfast twice. And most of the dinner joints didn't open till 6:30 or 7, if you wanted to eat early and then go back out for dessert or a lite bite later like many of us like to do at the beach. This was especially inconvenient on check out day since you had to check out by 12 but no food is available till after that and anyone with an afternoon flight needs to head on to the airport.The Drinks: I do agree with some of the negatives here. The drinks didn't do anything for us. The house drink, The Majestic, is very good. But basically what they do with all their frozen beach type drinks is premake them with no alcohol and then just pour a heap of rum in the bottom of the cup before pouring the mix over it. This makes for an OK pina colada, but not so much for other drinks that would make more sense with a dark rum, whiskey, tequila, and so on. The beer in the mini bar is Brahma, I could look at it and make my decision, I am a beer aficianado and I let my wife try it and she confirmed my concerns. Not good. They do have Presidente on tap, which is OK for a Pilsner and good for hot weather. That's about it. The room: we had a top floor garden view with a balcony that looked toward the beach and the neighboring resort to the West. I was very pleased with the overall decor. It wasn't the Ritz but it was very nice and had a good airflow. The thermostat stops at 20C (68F), so no luck in getting it any cooler in there, but I can understand the need to regulate this. The big fan helps. The bed is not great, we didn't have any back pain or anything but it wasn't a tempurpedic by any means. The sheets were probably 200 count at best, not sandpaper but not good. There is a 24 or 27 inch TV in the room with about 25 channels of DirecTV. We are from Atlanta so we found it hilarious that the DTV provider at the resort was Atlanta as well. It was like we were still at home. They carried Starz and I think there was HBO, I can't remember, didn't watch too much TV. Had ESPN though, that's all that matters. The bathroom is certainly not for private people, the open floorplan was great for me and my wife but it would not be good at all if you were sharing the room with kids or other people. I felt the cleaning crew did a good job daily, the floors were mopped and free of sand daily and my feet never felt grimy, so that's saying a lot.The resort: The grounds are beautiful. They have to work hard on the garden ponds, they have a lot of algae, but other than that this place is pretty much flawless. You would see no less than 30 workers out all day picking up and manicuring the grounds. The pool is too cool to even talk about. It is without a doubt the coolest pool I've ever seen beside Atlantis' Royal Towers. The freezing water in front of the Spa is great too in the hot day, it makes for a nice jolt. The lobby is very pretty but nothing awe inspiring. There's a good shop near the reservation counter with some nice handbags and other goods that were pretty reasonable. They had a free market the Thursday night we were there outside. It was alright, nothing you wouldn't find in the towns for a better price but they didn't seem to be robbing people either. The resort is long and narrow, so you might luck out and get really close to the beach like we did or you might get really close to the food, but for one of the two you are going to have to walk a long way most of the time. The walkways are a little weird, no straight path from front to back of the resort.The bathrooms: I section this off because I can't stand bad bathrooms at a resort. The pool water closets were not half bad for pool bathrooms but could have used better up keep. The bathrooms in the main building were so hot because that building has no air conditioning, it is open air. So the bathroom is like a sauna. Be warned, it is not a place to cool down.The service: I wasn't blown away by the service but I was never let down either. We didn't get into the whole Animation team thing, but they seemed to work really hard to entertain the people that wanted to participate. The counter service for check in and assistance was on par with most places, but I've certainly had better in other countries at cheaper prices.The beach: AMAZING. This is one of the most gorgeous stretches of sand (that's developed) I've ever seen. Powder soft and very well taken care of. They clean the seaweed up each morning and have people picking up trash all day. The Palapa huts (grass umbrellas) are very big, you can easily fit two loungers under them in full shade and three in partial. The beach was never overcrowded in my opinion even though the resort was full. Plenty of space. There is a great breeze all day that makes it so much more bearable here than Florida or other Caribbean islands I've been to. The beach is topless optional and many people choose to exercise this option. Wives and Girlfriends shouldn't be too worried, though, most of the women I saw scared me. The pool seemed to have a lot of topless sunbathers too, just be sure to know this before you go if it might bother you.The Ocean: I was disappointed in the snorkeling. The water itself is beautiful, clear to the point of losing depth perception. But it is very rocky on the Eastern part of The Majestic's beach. The rocks are full of sea urchins, although I never heard of anyone getting pricked. There were maybe 12 varieties of fish, some nice tropical colors, nothing over 10 inches in size. Friendly fish though, good for swimming with. I heard that you could take snorkeling and diving tours outside the resort that were great, but we did not do one ourselves.The Country: I've you haven't been to the D.R. yet, it is very similar to other Caribbean nations. They love to nickel and dime you outside the resorts but for the most part the people are kind and harmless. Don't drink the water, even though the resort doesn't tell you that, it took my bowels four days to recover from the trip because I drank a little from the tap during the night. The airport is a joke, be prepared for a LOOONNNGG wait on your return flight home, it took us every bit of 2 1/2 hours to go from the curb to boarding the plane and we were in a line the whole time, we never sat down. Seriously. There is food at the airport once you go through security. Most of these resorts have you check out by noon and you miss lunch. So thank goodness there was some food at the airport.A couple of notes, if you book through Expedia or GoGo, see if you can get a different transport provider than Hotelbeds. I won't go into our experience here, but I was very disappointed in them. Several people on the same flight as us had other transport companies and got to and from the resort way faster than we did and were picked up on time. Also, they tell you that you have to pay a $10 tax to enter the country per person and a $20 tax per person to leave the country. They got everyone with the $10 coming in, but I never saw anyone pay the $20 on the way out. But then I heard some people say they did pay it. So this is kind of a crapshoot. The Majestic only has one ATM in the main lobby and it only gives Dominican Pesos. The fee from the bank was $3.All in all, any flaws we found with the Majestic were negligent compared to the value in staying in an exotic place this nice for $250 a day all-inclusive. For that kind of money on a cruise ship you might get a balcony room if you get upgraded, but a crowded pool and rushed dashes to crowded beaches await you. Here, it's a moderate walk down to a gorgeous beach with plenty of room and shade where you can just relax all day and do nothing if you wish or find plenty to do. I highly recommend this resort on your next trip.

<Content>Amazing holiday Well - just returned from 2 week stay May 7 - May 21 and what a great time was had by myself and hubby.The fantastic reviews are spot on - a beach which is picture postcard and will never leave my memory. Fantastic pool - activities for all and great animation team - my husband likes to keep active whilst my fair skin stays under an umbrella and we both had the best time. Always got an umbrella but usually up early to secure this - OK up until about 8.30am - depends how important this is to you I guess.Ate at all restaurants during stay - our favourite by far was the Rodeo Steak House at the beach which does the best chateaubriand - it simply melts in your mouth. However, anywhere you eat will be great. The buffet restaurant has great variety for all meals particularly breakfast. The late night food bar serves up burgers and chicken wings for those hungry after too much alcohol and partying.Great drinks - try the Dirty Monkey - tastes like chocolate/banana milkshake but contains lots of alcohol. My husband also liked a Diperrinna - not sure how its spelt but was like a strong gin and tonic taste but contained white rum. Very sociable place to visit - if you want to socialise with others there is opportunity to do so particularly at the main bar area downstairs where special mention must go to Juan the best bar man in the world!Mainly Canadian and American visitors along with a handful of British and then other Europeans who do go topless mainly on beach but not problem for us (even saw some topless power walkers along beach - slightly unnecessary I think!).Rooms large and spacious - we were 3rd floor so used the stairs to try and work off some of the food and drink. They tried to put us into room beginning with 1 which had view of back of hotel next door (apparently garden view?!). Rooms beginning 2 and 3 have pool views and then 4 means you overlook the mangrove area on the other side of the hotel. Complained and were moved to pool view which was far better. Contrary to other reports they are not keen to upgrade you free of charge and wanted to charge us US$30 per person per night to upgrade to poolside room - would have worked out too much for our 2 week stay so declined that one!Nice casino - not massive but does the job - minimum bets on blackjack table US$5 or 100 dominican pesos which is equivalent to US$3 so cheaper to bet in pesos - bare this in mind if you're not looking to lose lots of money! The croupiers speak little english and are quite serious - they dont get involved with holiday makers or game which isn't so good. Also be careful and concentrate when playing as they sometimes dont pay out the correct chips or add up correctly! Be warned...Shops as mentioned by others are a complete rip off.Shows very good compared to other hotels I have visited - some of them do repeat weekly but we did see some different ones as well. Michael Jackson show very good as well as Circus and Magic - how does he make his assistant who is quite a tall girl disappear!! Disco a bit hit and miss - rocking some nights and then others no-one to be seen but good fun to have a little boogie and give singles chance to meet people.Took day trip out to Saona Island with 2 hour coach trip each way and then catamaran to the island and speed boat back. Enjoyed these boats but overall island trip disappointing for US$90 each. Sea bed rocky and difficult to walk, sea although Caribbean not very clear and sharp dip when entering water. Much better sea/beach at Majestic.Overall excellent relaxing holiday at superior resort in Dominican - have previously visited the North of the island but Punta Cana is much nicer both in terms of beach,sea and the resort. We could not end this review without mentioning the best buddies ever - Mini G and FB - we're coming to Boston to visit - like it or not !!!! You made our holiday x

<Content>Second time at the Majestic and still number one Gatineau, QC jegjsamson@sympatico.caWe spent the first two weeks of May at the Majestic Colonial and our holiday was just fabulous. We were treated very well by all the staff. At the reception, Mister Victor, Juan, Roberto, Richard were always ready to help. Although the hotel was 94% full, they were able to change us room to accommodate us with a quieter suite. Everyday at the buffet restaurant we were greeted with smiles and felt welcomed by Joselito, Martina, Jaqueline just to name a few. The bellboys were also helpful whether it was with the luggage or give us singles for tipping for our ten dollar bill - Edgar was our favorite. The maids were all very nice and smiling all the time. We enjoyed the food at the buffet, Japanese, Steakhouse and Sea Food Restaurants. There is so much variety that there is something for everyone to enjoy. The beach is awesome and the ocean is very warm - we went swimming everyday. We did not use the pool because we simply prefer the beach but the pool is huge and seems very clean. We also used snorkeling equiment and fins that was provided by the resort and we were surprised to see the large number of fish right in front of the resort. We were at this hotel last year when the resort was awarded the five stars - and what a party is was. Some local dignitaries were invited and the staff really went out of their way to put together this event. To summarize this review, we are absolutely satisfied with the Majestic Colonial and next year we are hoping to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary there. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need to be convinced that this is the place to book.

<Content>This Place Is Fun!!!! Four of my friends and I have been to The dominican before and I speak for all of us when I say that this place blew the others out ofthe water. The pools were clean, the bedrooms were out of this world(which included complimentary bottles of wine). The only complaint that I has to do with checking in which took us a good hour. I would advise for the drinkers the Majestic, orgasmo, and the dirty monkey. IF we were going to back again next year I wouldn't hesitate for a second on going back to the Majestic. This Is a great place for singles beacuse there are alot for single groups that go here, and everyday there are just more and more people showing up. It is such ahot spot that they overbooked for the Friday night that we were thereand we had to stay at another hotel that night which just goes to show the kind of reputation this hotel has (they let us know before going on the trip that it was overbooked.P.S For Da Boyz!!!

<Content>Majestic Colonial Great resort! I just returned home on 5/16/07 after a nice vacation at the Majestic Colonial. This was my seventh trip to the Dominican Republic and one of the best. I have one criticism.- the beds are hard as a rock. I would gladly go back if softer and better mattresses were installed.

<Content>The best vacation so far! First let me say that we booked this vacation through CheapCaribbean, who did a fantastic job and took care of all the details. They even got us an upgrade to first class on the trip down. I would highly recommend working through them. The price was good and the service even better. We stayed at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana from May 11-16 and we could not have had a better time - relaxing, beautiful and they treated us like royalty. This resort is more upscale than some of the others and the beach is also much nicer. The staff at the resort was first class, our room was gorgeous with a stunning ocean view and the food was great. We ate at each of the 5 restaurants at the resort. My only complaint, and it's not really even a complaint, is that the nightlife leaves alittle to be desired. I wish they had some live music or local groups to play in the evenings. Most everything started at 10:00 p.m., which is late when you've been out doing things all day. The Michael Jackson show was hilarious!The stores in site are kind of high in price, but you can get great deals at the Plaza outside the front gate. It's about 2 blocks away and you can walk or take a taxi. The shopkeepers are very aggressive and will hound you to buy from their shop. I just kept my head down and focused on what I was looking for. You also have to negotiate on everything. My rule was to automatically take 50% off the quoted price and then negotiate down from there. You can usually purchase items for about 30-40% of the original cost. Once they see the money in your hand, they won't say no.The beach and water are breathtaking - crystal blue with the cleanest sand I've ever seen. I have to stress that everyone needs to use sunscreen everyday. The sun is strong, but you don't realize it until afterwards. My husband got burned pretty bad the first day and had to watch it the rest of the trip. I was fine with using 30  50 each day. The animation team does lots of activities on the beach - stretching, aerobics, dance lessons and games. They were a good group with LOTS of energy. We took the Monster truck excursion which was fun and very educational. You really got a sense of the people and culture. Visiting the Voodoo Priest in the sugar cane fields was the highlight of the day. It is hot when you get away from the beach, so dress appropriately. Hats and sunscreen are a must. I would definitely recommend this excursion.We had a great time, and the cost and trip were easy. We will go back again next year and try one of the other resorts. I highly recommend the Dominican Republic.

<Content>Second time at Majestic Colonial I recently returned from my 2nd trip to the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. I was there for the first time last Fall about 6 months ago and we loved it!!! The hotel is beautful and wonderful and clean accomodations. The one thing I had noticed this time and was very disappointed in was the change in entertainment staff. On my first trip they seemed much more enthusiastic and motivated but not this time around. They were still very pleasant and offered alot of activities but for some reason, they did not seem as happy this time to be there. I do not know the reason for this... but I hope that this changes because entertainment was so wonderful on our first trip and they really do make a positive impact on your vacation stay!

<Content>Great Honeymoon Destination I researched many possible honeymoon destinations for several months prior to finally deciding on the Dominican Republic and my wife and I were certainly very pleased that we did. We honeymooned from 05/14 thru 05/19 and this resort and it is absolutely fantastic in my opinion and I've never been around people that were so polite and freiendly as the staff is at the Majestic. Below are some of my observations and recommendations:1. If possible bring with you air deodorizer that will eliminate mildew odor. We had a lower level room and it smelled a little musty. We purchased a scent candle at the gift shop that helped a little, but I would have loved to have had a can of good old fashioned Lysol. Overall, it wasn't bad enough to register a complaint.2. Insects were not a problem either. However, I would recommend bringing a small can of bug killer as at times we did notice these tiny little ants crawling around near the mini frige. Overall though, they were not a big enough problem to register a complaint as they eventually just disappeared.3. The staff does not expect tips but these folks are always on the ball, very polite and try very hard make sure your needs are met. We tipped a lot mainly because the serivice was exceptional. We tipped anywhere from $2 to $5 depending on what service they provided. We asked for 2 extra bath towels once and from that point foward we always had 2 extra ones without asking after housekeeping cleaned the room. Again, the service is great and tips are apprecitated and well deserved IMO.4. The food is your standard buffet fare. Not great, but not bad either. Breakfast is very good. Lunch is okay and dinner is okay. The Japonese restaurant is very good and I recommend it. We did not get the chance to try the seafood restaurant, but the dishes that I saw looked very good. The steaks at the steakhouse were good too. Overall, we had a great time and will return to this resort. Our main objective was to honeymoon somwhere where we could simply relax and the Majestic certainly allowed us to do that. Hope my information helps!

<Content>Team Animacion This hotel would be perfect for couples and people who are trying to rekindle their marriage. As a 21 year old single woman I was a bit bored at times BUT that changed due to the great people that they have on staff. These people were always seen on the beach in the morning, at the pool in the evenings and at the shows and bar at night. They dance with you, converse with you and are very pleasant to be around. Their names are: Nelson, Kiko, Ray and Sandy. I want tosay thank you to these people in particular for making my stay a pleasant one. Their outgoing nature and abiliy to make me laugh was priceless. I hope that they are rewarded for the work that they do.

<Content>Excellent All Inclusive Resort! We have been to the Dominican Republic 2 other times but at Puerto Plata area instead of Punta Cana and this is our third time to DR and first time to Punta Cana. We were there the week of May 12, 2007. We stayed at another 4 star hotel the Hilton Coral Marien in Puerto Plata and it was no where in comparison to the Majestic. Majestic is very nice hotel and most who have stayed there have nothing bad to say about it. It is the same for us. However, since different folks have different preferences on what is consider a good resort, my review will consist of a list of the pluses and minuses in my opinion of the resort for each person to decide for him/herself.Pluses- Lobby area is grand and beautifully laid out for entertaining.- Pool is a huge river like format that flows from the lobby area to the beach area.- There are always available clean chairs around the pool and beach area whether you enjoy the shade or the sun.- All areas of the resort are scenic and clean. Most areas are formal and elegant.- The rooms are great and the one we were in had jacuzzis inside and outside our room in a private patio area separate from the balcony.- Staffs are courteous and friendly.- Since it is May, we did not have any trouble with mosquitos which is a really good thing for me personally since I hate having to put on bug lotion every night. I am not sure if it is just this resort that doesn't have them or because it is in May. There are other bugs like small ants occasionally near the sinks but that's given for hot weather tropics.- Walkways are well lite so it feels safe to walk around at night.- There is a safe in the room free of charge for all your valuables so you can feel at ease leaving things in the room.- The mini frig is stocked daily with bottled water, soda and beer for your enjoyment free of charge. There is a bottle of champaign to welcome you on the first day.- The resort gives out free bottled water if you ask at any restaurants you eat at. This is great since you can't drink tap water there.- The nightly shows are decent. They are not lame like the other resorts I have been to. We saw a Michael Jackson impersonation show and a gymnastic circus show and they were both decent. There are actually talented entertainers at these shows to keep your attention.- The resort is only about 30 mins car ride from the Punta Cana airport which is better than some which are 1 hour away.Minuses- Food was just OK at all the restaurants. Maybe it is because it is a different country so the meats like beef specifically tasted a bit game-y. Other than that, if you stay with the basics like chicken and pasta, you will be fine. There are enough variety for a few days to find something to keep you satisfied. If you have reservations to the French restaurant, try the Grouper (fish), it was really good if you like fish. If you are at the Japanese restaurant, you'll be having Hibachi style chicken, shrimps, fish, beef, veggies, etc.- The pool and the beach are pretty much closed after 6 pm so there is no late night swimming. The weather is so nice sometimes you might want to jump in after dinner but can't.- The toilet in the room is very very small. Everything else in the room is great except the toilet which is a separate stall from the shower and very narrowed so if you are afraid of small spaces, you will find it a little weird. I am a very small person, less than 100 lbs and I still felt trapped.Not Applicable to our trip:- We have no kids so we don't know how the resort is for children. We did see a children play area with water slides just for the kids. There is also a children pool.- We did not do any excursions this time but have to say that the staffs are courteous enough not to hassle you if you are not interested in them.- We did not go to the disco at night so we are not sure how great it is.- We briefly checked out the casino and it was a decent size for a beach resort hotel.

<Content>The greatest vacation!! All I have to say is fantastic!! We arrived on May 7-13th and it was the best week I've had this year. My friend and I (both single women) did not know what to expect going in, especially that it seemed that many couples visited the resort. We were hesitant, but decided to give it a try. Best idea I've had in a while. Not only was the resort beautiful, but the staff was amazing, the food was close to impeccable and we made some great friends (singles, couples, staff etc...). The rooms were very nice and quite large compared to other chain hotels/resorts. The disco was fun, but only until about 12:30 or 1, when people started to leave, whether to go out on the town or just back to the room. On themed nights ( tropical night, 70's-80's night), there were more party goers who stayed out later and the entertainment staff did a great job every night of getting everyone involved. You know who you are Nelson, Tyson, Rey, Samuel and the rest of the team!The shows performed were good, but the theater is open and it could be a little stuffy with all the humidity and drinking. We ended up skipping most of the shows.Please do not miss the pool, that's where most of the action takes place, between the Taki Taki dance, water polo, grab the towel and salsa lessons it was always a delight to be there and, of course, the pool bar.Best restaurant was the Rodeo Grill. It's perfect, right on the beach with the best chateubriand I've had in awhile. The buffet by the lobby was also great for all meals (although we always missed breakfast) and the food was exceptional.Security is pretty tight so outsiders (such as straggling vendors on the beach) are kept at a minimum.There are vendors who arrive on Thursday and try to sell you souvenirs. They are pretty aggressive and you can barely walk by without them coming up to you. They were located to the right of the water fountains.I think this a great resort for all travellers and should not be missed!

<Content>Service Horrible! I stayed at the Majestic Colonial for a girl's weekend trip in May. I have to say the service we received there was less than desireable.It took us over an hour to check-in. Once we finally received our room key and open the door, a man was coming out of the shower! My girlfirend trekked back to reception (and she speaks Spanish fluently) only to wait another 30 minutes to speak to someone about the room being occupied and ONLY then to argue with him for another 20 because he didn't believe her when she said the room was already occupied. The fella who helped us with the luggage stayed with us because he thought it would only take a few minutes for the my girlfirend to get another room, but after waiting for 45 mins he went down to reception to see what was going on. It was only after he went down and told the front desk that the room was occupied did we get another room. Once everything was done it took almost 2 1/2 hours to check in! Unbelievable!!If that wasn't enough, my luggage was ransacked and money was stolen out of my suitcase. It was buried so deep in my belongings (I took enough clothes and shoes for a month) that just before I discovered the theft we noticed that the room wasn't cleaned properly. No fresh towels or wash cloths. The sink wasn't cleaned, floor wasn't swept, the bed was barely made. No doubt, because our belongings were being searched when the room was supposed to be cleaned. To make a very LONG story short, my girlfriend called the front desk to speak with the hotel manager, and after being passed around from person -to-person like a joint, she finally got someone and when she asked who it was that she was speaking with, the person had the audacity to say DADDY YANKEEE. Needless to say... we were not in the least pleased. It took over 6 hours to get some sort of resolution -- after to talking to 1/2 dozen people. In the 5th hour of this ordeal, I was offered an upgrade on a room the next time I stayed there...AS IF I would go back to a place where my belongings were stolen. In the 6th hour, just before I was ready to leave, they finally agreed to pay for my spa treatment. Oh, by the way for those of you that were wondering...the safe was broken.I love the Dominican Republic, I go often...however, I will NEVER stay at that hotel ever again.

<Content>Fun in the sun I stayed at the Majestic Colonial with a group of 6 ladies from May 7-12. The Majestic is a beautiful resort, and is just as amazing as the pictures show. The beach took my breath away and I have been to several places in the Bahamas and Mexico.We had a few minor issues in our room--3208--small ants and anytime someone called into our room, it sounded like a helicopter was on the line...we could call out, though, but it was a challenge to make a credit card call. I would suggest bringing international calling cards as my cell phone was supposed to be international call ready and wouldn't work while I was there. We did see other people using cell phones at the resort. We spent time between the beach and the pool during the days. The animation team could be found at both places doing their best to get everyone involved in the activities. We did aerobics on the beach, which was fun and a great workout. The guys were great, and added so much fun to our trip--always had a friendly hola and smile whenever they saw you around. They would be in the disco every night after the show, and we danced often with many of them--Keiko, Alexander, Rey, etc...The only excursion we took off the property was the ATV tour that Jerry from VIP set us up with and it was a blast! We had the best time riding through some of the town and having the children wave to us--we rode on the beach and through some wildly huge, awesome mud puddles, which resulted in a mud bath for most of us...fun fun!Some drinks you may want to try when you're lounging around the beach or the pool are the Miami Vice, the Majestic, the Blue Hawaii and sweet basul(?).Make sure to take lots of pictures as we did not and now regret it! If anyone has any pictures they could share with us we would be very grateful--especially any of the animation team.

<Content>The Majestic is the place for anniversary fun! We stayed at the Majestic from April 17 to the 22nd and had the time of our lives! Just my husband and I for our 15th anniversary and what a great choice we made. ROOM - Excellent! We were in room 3401 - fourth floor on the end looking over all the action at night with the wedding gazebo right in front of us to watch the wedders. Although the shows went on at 10:30pm right next to us and we were sometimes done by then - the noise did not come into our room and it was perfect!FOOD - We always found a great meal. The chateaubriand (sp?) was fabulous, melt in your mouth at the Steak House. The Japanese restaurant was a blast and food was great. The chicken fajitas at Taino were just what we were looking for. The buffet always satisfied our bellies with their massive selection at any meal. STAFF - We can't say enough about them. Always friendly...never waited for anything. Animation staff was so energetic too and pulled us into some fun games and I think my husband had a crush on Lucy! She even got him to do beach yoga one morning. Ha! And the biggest shout out goes of course to Majestic Mike who was a master at getting anything accomplished you required. Such a lovely person and always was able to help you out. I miss him already. Best guest services guy we ever met!BEACH - Stuff a couple rolls in your pocket at breakfast or lunch and then sprinkle them in the water when you snorkle right off the beach to the left and it's phenomenal. We saw a ray swim right under us and so many fish of every variety and can't even begin to name them. We did this off and on all day long. TRIPS - We did the Marinarium and had a great day. Had a couple of quick storms out at sea and just made it more fun. Great staff, great snorkling, great drinks and fine tunes.All and all, you can't go wrong choosing this resort. It's so gorgeous and well maintained. Every night we danced under the stars and every day we swam, sunned and slurped many Presidentes!playallday

<Content>Very Disappointing We recently spent 10 nights (Feb 20-Mar 2) at the Majestic Colonial resort. Our Travel Agent warned us but we looked at the reviews on this website and were misled. This is the list of the problems that we unfortunately encountered during our stay: - Arrived at the Resort on Feb 20 and my wife became ill the next evening after arriving, accidentally messing up the room with vomit and we called housekeeping for room cleaning service, was promised to clean up soon, but housekeeping never show up on that day. The room was not cleaned until the next day. - Housekeeping frequently used a single full-size sheet to make the king-size bed. Because the full size sheet was so much shorter than the king-size bed itself, there was about a foot of the mattress exposed without any sheet Some days there were two bottom sheets to fully cover the bed other days just one leaving the mattress partially uncovered. Another result of housekeeping trying to use a single full-size sheet to cover the mattress was that by morning the sheet would be fully un-tucked from the mattress. - Resort has NO mattress pads for the bed which made us feel so uncomfortable without it.  - Not enough towels and shampoo, body gel... sometimes. Housekeeping was very inconsistent in replacing these critical bath items.  -The 2 glasses provided for mouth rising laying up side down on sink counter were not changed daily after use a few times they were noticeably dirty. - Noisy toilet running water none stop from time to time by itself, and we had to stop it by shaking the handle in order for it to stop.  - Shower door would not close completely. You had to be careful to keep the entire bathroom floor from getting all wet and becoming very slippery to walk on. - Room didn't get clean on wed, Feb, 28, so NO available clean towels for that day. We had to go down the hall to get towels from the maid's cart, and were promised by her for the room to be cleaned later that day, but room didn't get cleaned.  - Because the room had very limited supply of toiletry and didn't get clean the day before, so there wasn't a supply of toilet paper, we totally out of toilet paper. Again we had to chase down the maid for a roll of toilet paper after using the last available paper in the room.  - My husband had a gross experience sharing real cloth hand towels in public bathroom of the gourmet restaurant with hundreds of other men in the resort! He ended up having diarrhea the next day too. So we were not sure because of this dirt public hand towel or the food or could possibly both. - Shortage of electric power at least half dozen times for few minutes every time it was out while we were there for the 10 nights (had to eat in the dark or whatever we were doing). Also, every time the power went out the a/c had to be reset so if we were not in the room at the time it became very stuffy and smelled damped. - Light was so dim in the room, so neither my husband or I could easily read our bibles and we had to wait for brighter sunlight up in the morning, so we could stick our bibles in standing position by the patio door to read every morning. - Sometimes we could watch CNN or movies, and sometimes we could not watch it at all as a notice popped up covering the TV screen for an unpaid bill for satellite service. - Low quality food being used for guests such as broccoli wasn't fresh and often looked being cut off on tips of flowers and it looked more yellow than green.  - I ordered 2 appetizers in Chinese without planning to have any dessert or soup, so I could have enough food to eat, and was questioned by the waiter because he tried to stop me from ordering 2 appetizers. The waiter insisted that we order 1 appetizer, 1 soup, 1 entr茅e and 1 dessert. For this reason, we felt we couldn't freely eat as much as we like or whatever we liked, even though it is supposed to be an all inclusive resort. Any deviation from the normal menu (extra appetizer, extra entree or no soup) threw the service completely off resulting in longer than normal waits or failure to serve what was ordered. - We didn't have enough bottle water in our room, so we decided to get more from the bar to bring back to our room for the evening, but when the maid saw more than 4 bottles of water in the room the next day, she NEVER stock us anymore than 4 for us as we needed. We had to hide them from her in order for her to stock more for our consumption. Even though water was all we drank, but hardly anything else.  Other than all these problems that we had, one thing we appreciated the most was the entertainment. It was really good and funny. Best of all the animation staff started everything very punctual on the program they provided and NOT changing the program either like other resorts often do. So it seemed more guests participated in it and it was more fun. That's we appreciated and enjoyed a lot. So this became the BEST part of our trip! As you see with this negative experience that we had during the 10 nights we were in Majestic Colonial Resort, we felt that the resort didn't provide an adequate service the way it should to reflect as 4.5 stars resort that we were promised with such as clean room and good food and drinks, TV service...that we paid for. I would rate it closer to 2.5 stars.

<Content>Okay with some issues My husband and I just got back from a 10 day stay at Majestic from May 3-12. I will start by saying that resort grounds are well maintained and that the pool and beach are amazing. The food was average if that. The buffets are pretty standard but offer the same food pretty much daily. My husband and I found the Hibacchi to be the best meal of all and the nicest service. The only other a la carte that we enjoyed was the steak house. The seafood was horrible. Breakfast each morning was nice, you can get just about anything that you want. The standard suite does not include room service and I mention this because on the third night that we were at the resort I was ill and unable to go to dinner. My husband went to the italian buffet and asked if would be able to bring me back a piece of bread as I was unable to make it through a meal and he was told no more than once. They instead told him to order room service...we both found this interesting because each time that we were at that restaurant we noticed people taking plate fulls of food right out without being stopped. I was a little put off after that fact considering the price that we paid and every other place that I have gone that was all inclusive didnt care if you took food out. I was very upset and told my husband that I was going to search out Majestic Mike, whom I had read so much about. Until my husband told me that he believes that Mike was one that told him that he couldnt bring any bread to me. So much for that. Rooms were spacious and I loved the balcony. We were given a lovely room that overlooked the pool and had a small ocean view. Only problem was the amount of bugs (I would have expected this if I had brought food back to the room and let it set out) there were tons of ants and spiders. Some is to be expected given the climate but it was a little over the top. Not a good thing for a husband with a terrible fear of ants, especially when they are in the bed at night. The bed was a nice king size, I enjoy a hard mattress and it was that, I think it may have been two mats put together because from my husbands side to mine there was a definite dip that started right in the middle. There were plenty of pillows so that can help make up for the hard bed if you dont care for one. The only thing the pillows dont make up for is the sheets that dont seem to fit the bed and always came up, this meant by morning I was sleeping on the plastic cover (?) that was over the mattress itself...I felt like a toddler who might urinate the bed. The air never got cold and we had three lights out in the room. The balcony light sometimes went off at night and sometimes didnt making up for the lack of light inside but killing a good nights rest. I didnt mind the open concept. The toilet stall does have a door on it that gives visual privacy but yes you can hear things. If your a couple, your bound to hear those things eventually though right, lol. Entertainment staff, was great, there was always something to do. There were days that we didnt want to do anything and there was plenty of space for that. We always seemed to find a spot in the shade no matter what time of day and the hotel was sold out during our visit. Beach was awesome sand reminds me of Bermuda. We rented snorkeling gear thats included with the stay...they dont give flippers unless you pay for a snorkeling excursion which we happened to do. We had a blast on this trip, it was two hours and probably the best part of our trip. The one day we walked way down the beach and saw a cop with an automatic weapon escorting locals off the beach, this is not unusual of the caribbean in my opinion. Expensive...make sure you pack everything that you will need. I forgot our Tums and we got a small bottle at the minimarket and it was $10 US. Everything is very expensive, the one day we were buying a photo that was taken of us...I overheard a couple asking to purchase a disposable camera, it was $45 US. Needless to say they left without making a purchase. We only bought gifts when the vendors were all set up along caribbean street, your able to talk them down a little but I would have consider the prices we got to be a bargain by any means. We got a painting for $45 US after we bought it the girl said she was wrapping it up for us...well she took it completely off the frame and handed me a rolled up canvas. I noticed that everyone else was given the painting the way that it was for sale, including a frame that the picture was mounted on. Oh well, she was nice enough and Im sure they work hard for their money so I didnt say anything. I guess they list this place as a five star, I would not agree with that rating. I think this would be a great place for families or spring breakers but not someone who is looking for luxury and great food.Staff, some were great some could have cared less. It was busy when we were there and sometimes when you asked for things there were never given to you. We tipped everyone, regardless of their niceness. I have read how little the employees make and that leaves a spot in my heart. We noticed that some of the male employees approaced the females and had dates to go out with them later in the evening, so any single women looking for a How Stella Got Her Groove Back type affair, Im sure you can find it at Majestic.Now some stuff that I didnt use to evaulate my opinion of this hotel but things that I would have liked to know before going to the DR. Its a very poor country, lots of run down places that you pass on the way to the hotel. There doesnt seem to be the happy atmosphere that you get throughout the caribbean. The scenery lacks greatly. Not many flowers or things along that line. Be advised the airport is a nightmare to fly home from. We were flying first class USAir and there was only two sets of people in front of us, we waited over 30 minutes because people would come up behind us flag someone down with a $20 and get taken before us. Now mind you , the entire time we were waiting they were yelling for people in the coach line to come to the front if there were flying to Philadelphia. I finally went right to the front and just told them to get my ticket printed that I wasnt going to watch anyone pay their way to the front of the line. Im not sure why but our transfer picked us up at 12:30 (originally we were told 12:00) and we didnt get to the airport until about 1:45, our flight was leaving at 3. After all was said and done, this was probably the worst vacation that we have ever gone on from start to finish. All of this is just the opinion of someone who has traveled greatly and was expecting something classier. This is a perfectly suitable resort for plenty and if it were not located in DR, I would go back on a budget friendly trip but I guess its like the line...if it seems to good to be true, it is.

<Content>Total Relaxation! I would give this hotel a 5/5 for sure. The only other place I've stayed is Occidental Xcaret in Mexico. Majestic was waaay better.Food: Excellent for an all inclusive, some foods tasted strange; but thats when you just go get something different. Rodeo Steakhouse- great serloin steak. Caribbean- awesome chicken and beef fajita's! Seafood was decent- the shirmp was awesome too, but they only give you like 6 small garlic shrimp. Unfortunately we were not able to go to the japanese a la carte beause they were booked... We also didnt try the french. The buffet was huge; including salads, fruit, yogurt, pasta, meats..basically they had tons to try at breakfast and lunch. My husband and I didnt ever get sick and we ate and drank freely...the coconut juice had no effect on us. Our Room- We had a Colonial Junior Suite, room 1347. Huge deck with private jacuzzi, right on the beach and right beside the next resort. The view was so beutiful that it was hard to leave the room. Being beside the next resort was fun because you could watch people getting drunk and dancing...very entertaining!! Everything was super clean, the bed was very firm, but they give you like 8 pillows so we used them to our advantage. We had some very tiny ants through out our room, but they didn't bother us at all...PERFECT for couples.Overall we did not participate in any activities, we stayed to ourselves and had THE MOST RELAXING vacation I have every been on... At night they have disney movies at 7 in the theatre.. its just kinda neat. I WOULD NOT reccomend this hotel to people with children, the kids club is somewhat secluded from the pool and I never saw children or staff in that area. Beach- awesomeReccomend: get your picture taken with the monkey and the parrot- they are so fun to take home and show off!email me for pictures : aimee03reynolds@yahoo.com

<Content>Severe Post-Vacation Withdrawal We just returned from a six night stay at the Majestic (May 4th-May 10th) and will definitely be going back. This was by far the best vacation we've ever been on. This place leaves nothing to be desired.HOTEL ROOM AND GROUNDS: The room was amazing. Our room (2101) had an internal and external jacuzzi with direct pool access, a comfortable four post bed, a complimentary bottle of champagne on our arrival, teri cloth bath robes, and amazing temperature controls. The pool, beach, and grounds were absolutely spectacular and well cared for. The entire place was spotless and every inch was beautiful. The pool was the best we've ever experienced. It was large enough that if you wanted seclusion and privacy, you could essentially have your own section. If you wanted more of a group/activity filled experience, you could have that too by the wet bar. The animation team was constantly organizing games, races, and dance lessons at the pool and the beach, which were all so much fun. The beach was picturesque with extremely fine sand and warm, clear water. We played beach volleyball everyday and had a blast. Special thanks to Kiko of the animation team for involving us in all activities. The entire animation team deserves a huge thank you!FOOD: This was our first all inclusive, but I can't imagine many others being THIS good! There was such a variety for breakfast, lunch, and dinner at each of the restaurants. The wait staff was filled with incredible people who were so sweet and helpful. We are from Manhattan, New York and are used to pushy quick service, so we really appreciated the laid back conversational atmosphere. The meats at the Japanese and French restaurants were delicious. Our favorite place ended up being the indoor buffet for dinner because of the variety.NIGHTLIFE: If you stay at the Majestic, I'd highly recommend attending each of the nightly shows. The shows we saw were;Battle of the Sexes, International Dance Show, Michael Jackson Show, The Ideal Couple Show, Mr. Majestic, and an acrobatic show. All were amazing. The casino was alright, and the disco/sports bar was a lot of fun if that's your thing.All in all this was an incredible bang for your buck resort, where if your interested there's never a minute that you'll find yourself bored with nothing to do. We'll definitely be coming back!

<Content>Animation Crew was awesome I went to the Majestic for a wedding. There were 26 of us in the group. Everyone had the best time. The beach was awesome, the food was good, the people that worked in the resort were unbelievable. The animation crew deserves a lot of credit. They work so hard to get the guests danicng, singing, playing games, aerobics and so on!!! The rooms were beautiful and the beds were comfortable. Everyone in the resort is very friendly and always willing to help. The wedding was just the way the bride and groom wanted it. Everything went right for them on that day. I would definitly go back to the Majestic, especially for the atmosphere, it was great.

<Content>Great time - I hope to be back My wife and I stayed at the Majestic for four nights at the end of April/beginning of May 2007. This is the 3rd all inclusive we have been to, but first time in the DR. I would go back again in a minute. Rooms I booked through [---] and grabbed the most basic (garden view) room available figuring I wouldn't be spending a lot of time in the room. We ended up in room 1311 鈥?Building 1, 3rd floor. For a cheap room, I was very impressed. Room was complete with a complimentary minibar with bottled water, a few sodas, and a few beers. Coffee pot was also standard. Shower stall was large with good water pressure. Toilet stall was strange as others have noted, but it didn't bother us. Our room didn't have any rooms above us, so they vaulted the ceiling over the bedroom area 鈥?nice touch. The balcony overlooked the resort next door. It didn't bother me because I spent a total of 30 minutes out there.A few suggestions: better pillows 鈥?I needed to use 3 when I normally use 2 at home. Wasn't a problem because we easily got more from the housekeeping staff. Our room only had a small garbage can in the bathroom. Not sure if this is standard, but a garbage can in the room itself would be very helpful.Food Just a general comment on the food 鈥?If you don't enjoy the food here, consider yourself a food snob. Yes, I found a few dishes on the buffet I didn't care for, but 95% of it was just fine. You can't compare an all-inclusive to fine dining from back home.Breakfast Buffet 鈥?The selection and quality of food at breakfast was excellent. I looked forward to breakfast every day. Crepes, pancakes, waffles, churros, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, cook to order omelets and egg stations, bacon, different types of sausage, plus a few other hot dishes.Lunch Buffet 鈥?I enjoyed lunch almost as much as breakfast. Again, plenty of select and good quality of food. The pizza choices were interesting 鈥?I hadn't seen corn on a pizza before, but it tasted fine. Plenty of salads and soups, cook to order pasta station, and a variety of hot dishes.Dinner Buffet 鈥?I didn't get to the main buffet for dinner, so I can't comment.Beach Buffet 鈥?The lunch offerings at the beach buffet were your basic hot dog/hamburger offerings. Nothing too special, but it worked.Japanese 鈥?Try to get a reservation for this place as soon as you check in 鈥?it books up fast. You don't really get a choice on the meal 鈥?it's fried rice, beef, chicken, shrimp, and fish cooked up hibachi style. You can take a stroll to the sushi bar and get choice of desert. I've definitely had better quality at home, but the variety during our stay made this restaurant worth it.Chinese 鈥?Same area as Japanese. No time for a visit on our stay.Steakhouse 鈥?The chateaubriand was excellent. Best meal I had during our stay. My wife had the sirloin and it was very good as well. The steakhouse and seafood restaurants are in the same building by the beach. Great atmosphere for an evening dinner. Get there early and you can pick a table with an ocean view.Seafood 鈥?We also enjoyed the seafood restaurant. I had grilled red snapper and my wife had shrimp. They don't skimp on the size of the shrimp either 鈥?very respectable for an AI.French 鈥?The French restaurant is the other ala carte that requires a reservation. Again, no complaints from the dining here. The chocolate fountain dessert was my wife's favorite of the whole trip.Dominican/Mexican 鈥?This is the only restaurant I would give a so-so rating. My wife had a seafood combination meal that she didn't care for. I had fajitas and they were fine except they only give you two tortillas 鈥?no big deal, just ask for more.BeachBavaro beach is one of the finest I've seen. You can walk miles either way from the resort and still be on the same beach. No rocks in the sand and crystal blue water. I went snorkeling around the perimeter of the swim area and saw 8-10 different types of fish.If you want a place in the shade, be sure to get down there by 8:30-9:00 to stake your claim to a chair. Otherwise, you can find a shade spot later in the afternoon fairly easy. It seemed like most people frequented the beach from morning to early afternoon.PoolThe pool is the crown jewel of the resort. It winds through the common areas between buildings. Water was plenty warm and it was never crowded. The swim up bar was a popular hangout, but it never took more than a few minutes to get a drink.StaffThe staff were helpful and friendly. The language barrier was never an issue. Knowing a few phrases in Spanish is helpful. They work long hard days, so be sure to tip a dollar or two for good service. They appreciate it.

<Content>I am going back ASAP....Awesome Resort Majestic Colonial is the best resort I have ever been to. The people are very friendly and attentive. Food is awesome, drinks are good butthe liquor is cheap liquor and hits you hard the next day. The beach and resort is absolutely beautiful. I had read reviews stating problems with bugs. I only saw a couple flies, no big deal, I see more bugs in my home state then I did there. I know enough Spanish to get by but all the staff that I talked to could speak English. It even rained one day and we still had a blast. I was impressed. I do not have one complaint at all. I highly recommend that everyone go.My friends and I are already planning our next trip there.

<Content>great resort My husband and I just came back from 8 days at the Majestic Colonial. We went there to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary. Everything was great. The service was unbelievable especially in the restaurants. The staff was constantly clearing off the table and refilling the wine glasses. Everyone was very polite too.The food was very good and I am a very fussy eater. We ate in the breakfast buffet, the Italian buffet. the steakhouse and the seafood restaurantOur room was on the first floor facing the pool. It was roomy and had all the amenities you would expect. The bathrooms are not totally private but it didn't matter to us.The pool is so large that you have no problem finding a lounge.and plenty of room to swim without bumping into people. The beach also had enough lounges.We went on the ATV tour which we both enjoyed.I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved the Majestic! Stayed 1st-8th May 07. This was our 3rd time back to Punta Cana, but our 1st time at the Majestic - what a great place!BEACH: Bavaro beach is gorgeous (hence why we have been back 3 times!). Powder white soft sand, very wide beach with a beautiful turquoise sea. The beach at the Majestic has the best location and the biggest area compared to other hotels along the stretch - loungers/palapas are well spaced and lots of them - never crowded despite hotel being fully booked.POOL: Fab! A very long winding pool running through the middle of the resort which ends just short of the beach. A couple of jacuzzi's in there too and swim up bar. Always able to get a lounger. WEATHER: Absolutely scorching every day!ROOMS: The best room we have stayed at in the Dominican. The shower is huge! Rooms are very open plan - not sure how it would work for a family - but as there's only 2 of us, we loved it! FOOD/DRINK: I am a very picky eater and I did not have a problem at all. There is so much choice, I don't think anyone would go hungry here! Food and drink are available practically 24 hrs. ENTERTAINMENT: The Animation Team work really hard to put on good shows - and they do just that. Not the usual 'dancers in frilly dresses' type shows which seems to be the norm - their shows are really entertaining; the acrobatic show was great, the ideal couple show was hilarious and if you only see one show you MUST see the Michael Jackson show! Shows normally start at 10.00pm and finish at 11.00pm - after which just wander across to the Casino or Sports Bar.ACTIVITIES: Usual non-motorised watersports, plenty of paid watersports on offer too. My husband went diving and a cameraman went with him and filmed him - we bought the dvd for 拢25 and it was well worth it - edited so professionally to music. There's tennis, football and a golf course next door, gym, jogging track - there is plenty to do if you so wish.TIPPING: It's nice to tip here and there (bellboy, bar staff etc) - the staff all work so hard and are very obliging. We also left a dollar in the minibar each morning and got extra beer. We also left a dollar for the maid each day. OVERALL: This is a lovely hotel, great service, staff, facilities - I cannot fault it. It is quite big, but It's not 'enormous' as some say - (only approx. 240 rooms) - it's just a nice size, spacious and very well laid out.

<Content>Great experience My wife and I stayed at the Majestic for 4 days May 4-8 and had just an amazingly great experience. We wanted rest, relaxation and peace and got it. Hotel: beautiful place everything from the main lobby to the grounds to the pool to the buildings are magnificent. Room: We stayed in room 4240 - jr suite ocean view. The room was towards the back right hand side of the resort (opposite the pool side rooms) and looked out on a palm tree grove and the beach/ocean. balcony had a direct line of sight to the ship wreck. Incredible view. One negative was a old beat up chain link fence that ringed that side of the resort. Room was great, big with many nice touches. Bathroom was big (shower was huge) and was nice. Toilet was odd as has often been stated with only a 3/4 door but didn't bother us (I could see how that would be a big negative though for others). This was the second upgrade available to us (majestic jr suite was the first).Food/Drinks: I thought the food was pretty good - it didn't blow me away but I had a good meal each night. I ate at the Japanese one night and that was by far the best. We couldn't initially get a resv. but as we found out there are usually cancellations so we got in at the 6:30 seating (3 seatings - 30 people each seating). There was also a sushi buffet at the Japanese rest that was available to all diners. The Dominican/mex restaurant was also very good. The steakhouse was pretty good, the wife and I each had the chateau briand which was decent. The seafood rest was ok, fish was fresh (lobster and shrimp) and I like grilled seafood. In all the food was pretty good slightly better than expected. Drinks were always very good but it can be difficult to get exactly what you want at times depending on which bar you're at. Not a big deal as I stuck to the basics. Wine wasn't to my liking and I brought a few bottles down and brought one to the steakhouse which wasn't a problem. My rec to the resort would be to upgrade in the house wine dept. The buffets were better than expected - breakfast always had great fresh fruit - awesome passion fruit - and more than enough variety for our short stay. Lunch was as good. Beach buffet was basic and good if you didn't want to head into the main building. Pool/beach: Pool is unbelievable and the best I have ever seen or heard of. I spent almost all day each day at the pool bar which was quieter. If you wanted more action there was a swimup bar (wet bar) where the animation team spent the day. Beach was incredible as well with nice water (not too rough) and beautiful sand. getting chairs wasn't a problem at the pool we usually dropped off some towels on the way to breakfast and never had any issues. Spa: Wife had a facial, manicure and pedicure and was happy with the services. I stopped in the spa when she made her appts and the place looked very nice. Other: Did some shopping at the Punta Blanca plaza right outside the gate which was standard. The vendors can be a bit much and I probably could have paid less for what I got if I wanted to be a pain the arse but was happy with the deals I got on rum and some pics. I also traded a titleist hat for a bottle of rum so feel free to bring down some stuff to trade. I also went on the Don Lucas cigar tour which was ok, prices weren't great and it took a lot longer than I expected but none the less it was ok. The prices at the resort were good and bad. Some stuff was crazy expensive but there were a few things that we got some good deals on. Staff were great and always helpful. Most understood my rudimentary spanish or english. All in all a really beautiful resort that met or exceeded my expectations and I would definitely return.

<Content>Great Vacation at the Majestic Colonial - NS Travellers We stayed at the Majestic Colonial from the 8th - 15th of April 2007. Had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed this resort. Our stay was made more enjoyable by the ever ready animation team who went out of their way to try and ensure that you had a terrific time on your vacation. Special thanks to Rey, Lucy and Chocolate for all the fun, hope to see you next year when we return for another visit. The service and food here was excellent and the rooms were great too. Found this resort to be the right size for our taste.

<Content>Best vacation ever First let me begin by saying my husband and I have visited many places in the Caribbean. Aruba, Anguilla, St. Marteen, St. Thomas, Bahamas, Grand Cayman to name a few. Punta Cana and The Majestic Colonial is our new favorite. We were a little skepitcal reading some of the reviews before we went, but believe me we were more than pleasantly surprised. We vacationed with 5 other couples and had an outstanding time. The people in the resort were wonderful and tried their best to fill your every need. We enjoyed the food even though I read some negative reviews our experience was just the opposite. The beach was paradise....Pictures of the resort do not do it justice. From the moment we stepped in the lobby to when we left everything was just perfect !!!!! The rooms were great and it did smell a little musty which I think is coming from the air conditioning unit and probably cannot be prevented. We sprayed some of my body splash on a napkin and placed it in the vent and that took care of it just fine. I would suggest bringing all $1 bills for tips and those large thermos cups for drinks. Not that the drinks are skimpy or hard to get they certainly keep them flowing, but it will help to keep your drink cold. We would highly recommend the Majestic Colonial it was fabulous !!!!!!! We cannot wait to return next year.

<Content>Where Your Dreams Become Reality Upon arrival at the Airport we were unaware of the many wonderful memories that would be forever embedded in our minds. We arrived at the hotel and were immediately greeted by the hotel staff providing us with a frozen refreshment for our parched selves. Be sure to endulgein the Mama-Juana, mama wanna (Dominican Viagra). I have been to 5 different resorts for vacation 3 of the 5 claimed to be 5 star. The Majestic is a true five star resort. I have already looked into booking a return visit for the whole family (10 of us)! The food was wonderful, myself nor my girlfriend got sick once. The food selection varied wonderfully from Dominican to Japanese to French.... With options at the buffets only pictures can describe. 7 restaraunts, and always somewhere to get a bite. The rooms were great, and the hotel staff very friendly. The beach was perfect, not one day did we have bad weather. Rain is almost guaranteed, but we were lucky enough to only see it at night! I feel this resort is best for couples or groups of friends. We have made a number of friends on this trip that we will stay in contact with for years to come! Feel free to contact with quesions. If you book through Priceline be sure to add a transfer from the airport to hotel, and back to the airport. I was lucky enough to realize this prior to leaving for the Majestic. This is the place to go, especially for Red Sox fans!

<Content>Exceptional.... To begin, I used this website to read the reviews before booking my vacation. And I must say, I took everything that was said in to careful consideration. To say the least...I was NOT disappointed. My vacation was from April 26-May 3. Right off the airplane we were greeted by two lovely women dressed in traditional DR wear and took our picture. Walking through to the luggage terminal was very easy and luggages were out and I picked mine up in 5 min, I walked over to my bus and was taken to Majestic. It was about a 45min CRAZY drive to the hotel, but I loved it from the moment I walked off the bus. We arrived late at night, approx around 10:30pm. We were greeted by a bell-boy who gave us cold refreshing wet towels. I must say, they smelled very nice, and was very very refreshing. As we walked to the front desk to check in, we were greeted by a waitress who gave us a welcome drink in a martini glass, that was their signature drink titled Majestic, heehee not very original. Check in was easy and we were quickly taken to our room. Walking through the foyer and out to the courtyard, I saw beautiful palm trees, felt a lovely breeze and great structures and decor. We quickly freshened up changed and went for some dinner. Our first stop, the only thing open, was the Taino Restaurant. Keep in mind it was approx 11pm by this time, there was not the greatest amount of option for my taste, but there was enough.The next morning we were up at the crack of dawn and we began our day in BEAUTIFUL Punta Canada (heehee many staff were correcting visitors by saying we were from Punta Canada). The day was bright and the weather was perfect. Breakfast is great at the Buffet Restaurant Supreme. Its located just to the left once you exit the lobby. Their lunch is pretty good too. They have a large asortment of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We also spent some time at the beach restaurant for lunch, because it was convenient to access it from the pool and beach. Their lunch is good as well, but their dinner is more fancier and it is a-la-cart. It is separated in two different restaurants. One is Steakhouse, the other is Seafood. The ribs are EXCELLENT, Im not a fish eater, but the couple we stayed with said the seafood was excellent as well. No reservations needed. The other two restaurants we ate at were Le Gourmet (French) and Matsuri (Japanese). Both are a-la-cart and both require Reservations. But the trick to Matsuri, is that the reservations are only held for 10 min. the evening of your reservation and if you are more than 10 min late they get cancelled. So, for those who cannot get any reservations made (because it is a very good and very popular restaurant) the longest you will wait is 10 min. Because they accept walk-ins if reservations get cancelled. There are also appetizers such as sushi. This restaurant can only accompany 36 people at a time for Japanese, due to the fact there are only 3 rooms with 12 people each that serves the Japanese. There is a dining room with tables and chairs at the same location that serves Chinese food (a-la-cart). Food is exceptional, and you are offered hors-d'overs, main dish (rice with veggies, stir fried veggies, and a selection of chicken, tiger shrimp, beef, and filet of fish (or all of them), then there are 3 options for dessert (fried ice cream, fried banana, coconut flan). Le Gourmet also offered appetizers, main dish and dessert. We had pumpkin cream soup with a layer of puff pastry cooked over top the bowl. We then had chicken with potatoes and veggies. Not your regular chicken and potatoes. It was very good! And you also had a choice of desserts. All to many to mention!Offered through my rep from Signature Vacations were various excursions that are all very well examined, insured, and tempting. My boyfriend and I chose to visit Don Lucas, which is a Cigar factory that demonstrated how they were made and offered a cigar for my boyfriend to try. In the building next to it was a store that was filled with jewelery, clothes, paintings, figurines, cigars, rum, coffee, mammajuana and vanilla. If you plan to buy any of these things, take it from me, buy them here. We bought vanilla, coffee and rum and the prices were great. With $60 USD we bought 2 bottles of rum, 2 packages of coffee, 1 bottle of vanilla and 10 cigars. They offered savings if you bought two in stead of one. Taxes are included. Best of all, this excursion was FREE.We also did the Outback Saffari. I was not too impressed with this one. The guide took us to an old couples home and I felt as though I was intruding in their home, and glamourizing the way they live; and they live very poor. On the other hand, we saw coffee bean trees, cocoa bean trees, passion fruit trees (my new fav fruit eventhough not very appealing to look at), mangoes, wild life, sugar canes (and tasted), bananas, beautiful mountains and we ended by being taken to a secluded beach where we did boogie boarding. It was a full day excursion and we were provided a well balanced lunch. Another thing that I didnt like to much, was the fact that the guide expected a tip. He actually expected $15-20 USD from us. To be honest, I didnt feel as though he did anything above or beyond to deserve the tip. I had encountered other staff on my resort who deserved it much more, because they were exceptional. This trip cost $80 USD which perhaps was not worth it.There are other excursions that the resort offers, and one that I wish I would have tried was the Sanoa Isld. I hear that it was just beautiful and they were able to swim in Caribbean waters as opposed to ocean. They were taken a little further out in the waters and were able to see many starfish and were able to swim with them. They were also given a buffet lunch. Not sure of the price.The casino, shows and disco. What to say...the routine we usually took was after dinner we would head out to the casino until the show began. My boyfriend was the gambler. He stayed at the BlackJack tables. We won a fair amount of money over a few days. The minimum bet at the tables are $5 USD. You are also able to gamble with Pesos. This casino also has roulette, poker and slots. Although it's fairly small, we enjoyed it. The shows, make an effort to see them. We enjoyed all of them, even the Michael Jackson show. The person as MJ was a perfect replica of him. That show was full of lights and dancing and action. We enjoyed it very much. The rest of the shows were just as entertaining. There was one called Ideal Couple, I believe, and it was just HILAIRIOUS!!!! The things these people had to do were outrageously funny! We miss the announcer and his actions. This guy can speak Spanish, English, French, Italian and German. And he did so EVERY time he spoke. But it was soo natural for him that it was very quick. I love my job! Is what he frequently said when people on stage were acting very silly. These shows are very entertaining. I highly recommend catching them. You catch one, you will want to see them all!After the show, was the disco. All the staff that are apart of the entertainment shows will be at the disco. They will be making sure you are happy and you are dancing. There are 3 dances with choreography that occur each night. Follow the leader and two others. All three are entertaining and fun to do. Their entertainment is also carried over to the pool and beach. Just infront of the main lobby, there is a board that shows what the theme is for the show in the evening, and the times that various activities take place and where. Every night around 7pm they also show movies for younger children. Water aerobics every morning at 11:30am was my favourite! My boyfriend also enjoyed water/beach volleyball. This resort is great for families, young children, weddings, couples, and a group of friends. It has everything you need. The rooms are spacious, except the toilet area can be a little snug. But, the shower more than made up for it. I cannot say enough about the staff. They are sincerly EXCEPTIONAL, they make you smile and have a good time. Mjority know English very well and Gaby at guest services is also very nice and knows English as if it were her first language. We asked for a new iron and shower robes and said it was no problem and returned our call to make sure we received it. The staff really care about their service and really cater to you to make sure you are content. I would go back tomorrow if I could. Leaving was sad, you grow so attached to the staff that they almost become your family, even if you dont tip. But when you do, they would kiss your feet if you asked them to. They are very gracious and humble. They appriciate your company and like I said they remember you and will go out of their way to please you. The pool and room and beach and restaurants were awesome. There were no glass windows anywhere. Huge arches that were cut out that allowed for the breeze and sunlight. There are no doors to the entrance of the lobby, but entering the property of the resort there are gates and a security guard standing there watching who goes in and who comes out. He is quite the distance from the main resort, and you only see him when you enter or leave through the main gates. There is staff that are constantly cleaning, and maintaining the grounds of the resort. From the crack of dawn they are on the beach collecting the seaweed that washed up on shore. We walked down to view the rest of the resorts, and I must say, we had the cleanest beach, many huts (for shade) on the beach, and many chairs. We did not feel the need to reserve our chairs, but we were able to leave our towel there for lunch, and leave our stuff there if we decided to take a dip or a walk. We came back and found everything there. We also saw two gentlemen walking the beach collecting garbage that guests may have left by their chairs. There is also another gentleman, standing guard on the beach watching for any beggars, or people selling merchandise. Every Thursday, there is a market that takes place on Caribbean St. They sell anything and everything. You can bargain the prices down a lot. You pretty much make the price and they will most likely agree. If I were given the opportunity, I would leave again tomorrow! I reccomend this resort to ANYONE and EVERYONE. It is a perfect spot. You will not be disappointed. Also, if you are a beach bum or a pool babe, there is no need to take an Ocean View. I was hardly in my room and always by the beach. Paying extra for it is not nessecary. I had the perfect Ocean view from the beach. Reconsider the Ocean View...it will be a waste of money, in my opinion. I had the standard jr room, with a great view of the garden, and I was content. I was in the middle of everything. I was 5 min walking distance from everything. Please enjoy your trip, dont worry too much about the little things. You're there for vacation, dont let anything stress you out. Have a couple Blue Lagoons and all will be forgotten. It's a tropical paradise, enjoy it to the best you can!!!

<Content>BEST VACATION EVER, MAJESTIC COLONIAL, BEAUTIFUL RESORT My husband and I travelled to Majestic Colonial from April 7-14, to clebrate my 50th birthday. We knew we were in for an enjoyable time, as our cousins and friends had been to this resort in February. Boy, were they right !!! This was our 6th time to the Domenican Republic. The grounds of this resort are beautiful. I can't say it better than all the other great reviews that other travellers have posted. It is true, this is an excellent resort to visit. I kept thinking about my little 3-year old grand-niece, who would have enjoyed the kiddie pools and the little water slides, and yes, the great food that children and adults will love. There are all kinds of great, tasty foods everywhere on this resort. We didn't even get a chance to taste everything. There is a restaurant by the beach where you can have a lobster dinner every night if you wanted to. We never used the immodium, or any medication whatsoever. Never got sick, always felt good. I haven't heard anyone mention the Domenican at the centre of the buffet that cooks fresh pizzas all day, all kinds of different toppings, in a big pizza oven.For breakfast, there was just about everything you wanted, and so good. They had fresh croissants out of the oven every day, fresh fruit like i've never seen, and oh yes, that Passion Fruit that we can't get in Canada, was so good, fresh as ever. Beach was beautiful, blue turqoise water. Weather was near 30's every day, not a drop of rain.There's a church right on the resort, we went to Mass on Easter Sunday, was it ever neat. Father Antonio was right when he said, God brought us Paradise to the Domenican Republic, so you can come and visit us. This is one resort i will definitely visit again. Everything was perfect. Thank You Majestic Colonial, you're truly the best as most agree when they go there. Great Place, Great People, Great Food !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>A little piece of paradise Returned from a wonderful week April 12 - 19, 2007)at what we call a little piece of paradise( the Majestic Colonial), My husband and I and friends of ours had a wonderful trip from start to finish. We had heard so much about how great his resort was , we were worried that it was hyped up too much. Not so. This is a definite 5 star resort.The rooms, the beach, the bars, the entertainment, the animation team,the incredible pool, the spa, the casino and the BEST service I have ever had at a resort . Food was above average for an all inclusive resort. The only thing we could find wrong with the Majestic were the bathrooms. No privacy. European style toilet area, so the door did not go all the way to the top or bottom. Not great for having friends over. However this was a minor inconvenience as we did not spend much time in our room.Majestic Mike and all the staff were very willing to help with any concerns you may have.Don't miss the Japanese restaurant. This was a real experience and the best food ever.I could go on and on, but this sums up a terrific week at an amazing resort.

<Content>Fantastic Resort - We'd Definitely Go Back! We spent 4 nights / 5 days at the Majestic Colonial and it was a fantastic time! Here are some of our observations / opinions, we hope you find them as helpful as we have found some of the other reviews here:The Lobby - We were greated with lavendar scented cold towels upon arrival, great touch. Our room was ready and the gentleman at the desk was extremely friendly and funny. The lobby is open and airy and beautiful. The Room (Garden View w/ Jacuzzi) - I read some other reviews before going and I can see how some people would find fault in the rooms for it's open layout. The toilet has a frosted glass door that is open on the top and it's rather small. The shower also has a frosted glass door that is open on top, but it's very large and spacious. We had no issues with privacy, though. The rooms are very spacious, open, and clean. The bed was on the firm side. Our patio had access to the pool as well as a jacuzzi and 2 lounge chairs, plus a small table with 2 regular chairs. At night, with the pool lights lit up, it was a fantastic little retreat for us. Our only complaint was that our room was never clean by the time we returned around 5/6PM. We had to call house keeping every day, but they were responsive. The Beach - The beach was beautiful! There is ample seating, but in order to get a tiki shade close to the water, we put our towels down around 8:30AM. If we hadn't, we still would have been able to find seats, just not in our ideal location. The Pool - Huge! We didn't spend too much time there, but there was also ample seating all around the pool. Restaurants:Japanese - Make reservations when you arrive at the hotel for this one if you want to have the private room with the hibachi chef. To our surprise, the food was very good! We definitely recommend it. Everything had a very fresh, ginger taste.French - Make reservations when you arrive, but this one has much more seating so it's not as difficult to get in. We had the steak, and it was excellent. They have a great wine selection as well. We recommend this restaurant.Carribean - A mix of Mexican and Dominican Food. Ok selection. The food was good. We'd recommend the Japanese or French over this one. But our preference usually isn't for Mexican food.Seafood - Great location, right off the beach. There was minimal appetizers, but the fish itself was excellent. Their lobster tails were huge! We recommend this restaurant.Steak - Didn't go, can't comment.Breakfast / Lunch - We went to the main buffet for breakfast. They had everything you can imagine! We were big fans of the fresh fruit and spanish tortilla. Lunch was our least favorite meal. They have a little bit of everything, though. Entertainment - There were activities all day long from dance lessons to yoga to funny games during the day. At night there was a band playing near the lobby. There were shows most nights. One night vendors set up a small flea market. We really didn't take advantage of these (except for the live band), we were more on a sit and do nothing vacation this time around. But with as much action going on, we had no problem finding a quiet place to sit and relax. There is definitely something for everyone! Our favorite things - The Beach, and having drinks at the different bars. The resort has so much seating, you can always find a place to sit and relax. The staff is very friendly. Bring singles to tip, although gratuity is included, they do accept tips. Pictures do not do this resort justice. It is absolutely beautiful! We highly recommend it and would definitely return for a future 5 day getaway.

<Content>This resort is perfect The hotel and grounds were beautiful. Our room was extremely large and very comfortable. Everything was imaculately clean. The beach and pool were the nicest we have ever seen, the food was incredibly good with lots of variety and really beautiful presentation. But far and away the best part of the resort was the incredible hospitality of the staff. Every person we met was cheerful, friendly and very accomadating. Victor at the front desk was terrific and made sure the whole week was perfect. We had four teenagers with us and they had a really great time and were constantly busy.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation Spot We visited the Majestic April 14th -21st. Overall the resort was a fantastic vacation spot. Food - Very good, with something for everyone. We especially enjoyed the Taino, and Steakhouse restaurants, and the main buffett provided an exceptional breakfast selection to meet any traveller's taste. i.e. fresh fruit, rolls, breads, real orange juice, and a various assortment of hot breakfast dishes made to order etc. Mini bar in our room was stocked daily with beer, soft drinks and bottled water. All drinks including bottled water were also available at all the bar facilities. We did not have any illness. Our travel representative at the hotel did caution us to take it easy with our consumption of the specialty drinks. Most are made with fresh fruit and can cause some unwanted health issues if you drank too much (either with or without the rum). Rooms - very nice, however we would consider them more suited to couples than families due to the room lay out. The beds were firm but certainly quite comfortable and the pillows were also quite good. We were located in room 2341 - 2nd building from the beach, on 3rd floor over looking the pool. Great location if you wished to be near the beach and away from the main lobby entertainment in the evening. Rooms were very quite and you could not hear noise from other rooms. We did not have any musty smell in the room. Rooms cleaned everyday, with fresh linen, and towels. Occasionally we did not receive any face cloths, however this was not a problem. Service - We had one or two occasional requests during our stay and the staff was more than helpful, delivering items right away. Our room had a minor leak caused by the air conditioning unit. We called at 7:30 a.m. and they assured us someone would be available by 8:30 a.m. They arrived as stated (3 workmen) , corrected the problem and left the room within 20 minutes. In general all the staff were very friendly, and helpful including the front desk. At our arrival, they had extra staff on to meet the new guests arriving. We were quickly served and directed to our room. We did leave some items for the maids daily, and tipped the waiters. Take some US $1 the staff certainly appreciated the gesture. We also took a few items to give to the gardners or outside beach cleaners etc. . These fellows work very hard and don't receive items or much in the way of tips. They were very appreciative of the gesture. Entertainment - Live entertainment each evening outside the lobby /buffett area - OK. Piano upstairs in main lobby - easy listening. Shows at 10:00 p.m. nightly in theatre - Michael Jackson show was the best. Several had audience participation and overall some what amateur, but funny. This resort did not have the professional style entertainment we have enjoyed at other resorts in Cuba. Beach /Pool - FANTASTIC - there were lots of huts on the beach however most were taken by 9 -9:30 am daily. We did note they started to be available again early in the afternoon. The pool was fantastic also with huts and lots of loungers. Overall this was a wonderful vacation resort and we would certainly consider returning.

<Content>You Will Have a Fantastic Time -- Do not hesitate or have doubts After sorting through dozens of hotels and tripadvisor ratings, I was admittedly somewhat paranoid about, well, any hotel. But the truth is, you'll almost always find someone who had a terrible experience. Don't let one person's misfortune or, sometimes, obnoxiousness, ruin your vacation plans. The Majestic Colonial is a great hotel. It's not a Ritz-Carlton. But the price different between it and a hotel of that class is enormous. The difference in service however, is minimal. The Rooms are large and impressive. Be nice to the receptionist when you get into the hotel from the airport. Very nice. Ask for a room closer to the ocean and she'll honor your request if at all possible. We got a room that had a view of the pool and the ocean. It was perfect. The rooms are very comfortable, very new and very spacious. No complaints here. The food is above average for an all-inclusive resort. While the standard cafeteria offers a typical buffet, the restaurants where you can make reservations are great. The French restaurant is very good, and the Japanese place is also great. Make sure you make the reservations as soon as you get to the hotel, because they fill up quickly, especially the Japanese place. Luckily, when we went there, the other people did not show up and we were the only ones served by the Chef. The steakhouse near the beach is also great. Alcohol. Few complaints here. They will make you almost anything, and if they can't make *exactly* what you're asking for they'll make you something very similar that sometimes will be better. For instance, I asked for a Mohito at one point, but they made me a Caipirinha instead, which was very good and very similar. For some of the higher end alcohol, there may be a charge, but that is clearly indicated on the drink menu. However, sometimes the waitress conveniently forgets, especially if you are friendly. Don't be alarmed if someone asks you for your room number when you order a drink that you thought was free. This is for statistical purposes (they call it control). Beach is fantastic. No more needs to be said. Take an excursion. Take the free trip to the cigar factory if you're into cigars. The factory (it's a room in a nice compound) will give you a tour of the manufacturing process and then take you into the shop where you have the option of buying something. He puts no pressure on you and speaks very good English. DO NOT BUY CIGARS from the shop in the hotel. They are incredibly overpriced. We also took the Saona island excursion. It was fun to get off of the resort and see the countryside, but it wasn't as fantastic as I had imagined. It's still a good idea to try to get off the resort for a day. The staff at the hotel are wonderful. They are genuinely nice and interested in helping you. While some speak little (or no) English, they will try to help you in any way possible, even if that means finding someone who understands you. If you speak Spanish, you'll have a blast. I had the opportunity to talk to a lot of Dominicans on the trip. They are all extremely friendly people who are willing to share more about their culture and life. While tipping isn't at all expected or necessary, having a lot of singles on you may not be a bad idea. $1 is a very nice tip for most of these people. If you're in a group, and in one of the reservation restaurants, or being served by a waitress for the night at the bar, leave a few dollars, and they will both remember you and be extremely grateful. Many of the people who work at the hotel live in the complex because their families/homes are too far away to travel each day. They get paid a few hundred dollars a month and yet they are genuinely happy to have a job and to work with us tourists. All in all, a fantastic time.

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous!! Spent a week at the Majestic from 4/17 through 4/24. Here are the highs and the lows:Airport was probably the worst run I have ever seen - no organization, hundreds of people swarming with no ropes to form lines, no idea of where to go or what to do. Once through immigration found one of our bags was missing - tried to communicate with an airport rep and filled out a form. Miraculously the bag arrived at the hotel at the end of the day - sheer luck! We arranged transportation through Expedia and had no problems there. The only annoying thing was that they couldn't tell me what time they would be picking us up at the hotel for the way back. I was forced to go meet the rep at the hotel 3 times before they could give me that info.Arrived at the hotel around 1:30 - the 2 rooms weren't ready so we went for lunch at the buffet. Finally got the rooms around 3:30 and they were next to each other but not pool views. Also, one of the rooms had a terrible musty odor. I went to the front desk to try and switch rooms but they said the hotel was full. They promised to send someone right away to wash the room and try to eliminate the odor. Well after calling THREE more times no one ever showed up so we just gave up. Eventually as the weather dried up the smell went away. The rooms were big and comfortable with awesome air conditioning. The shower was huge but the toilet area was a little small. There were a few too many mosquitoes for my taste but that is to be expected in the tropics - just a few bites on the kids, or so I thought....Next day my 8 year old woke up with his eye completely swollen shut! We took him to the 24 hour medical clinic on site. The woman doctor there was very kind and helpful and gave him a shot of something that brought the swelling down after 24 hours. A little unnerving but the response was comforting.The food: all the food was better than I expected. I am NOT a fan of buffets but how else could they feed all these people economically? The breakfast was unbelievable - fresh juice, eggs, omeletts, pancakes, waffles, breads, rolls, crepes, yogurt, fruit shakes, etc. But the best thing were the freshly made churros - nothing like the mushy ones you get in the US! I ate at least 4 every morning. And the coffee? Best I've ever had. The lunches were a little limited - 2 buffets - one on the beach and the breakfast one. Dinner was a choice of the breakfast buffet where they had Italian, or the other sit down restaurants - Mexican, steakhouse, seafood, Japanese and gourmet where only 12 and up can go. All were pretty good but the menus were small and not child friendly. Initially my 8 and 10 year olds didn't eat anything because there were no chicken tenders or mac and cheese. But guess what? Since they were hungry they tried new things and now they both like steak! Pasta was only available at the main buffet for dinner. The desserts were also fantastic - a different variety every night. The chocolate cakes were the best and they always had an ice cream bar - you must try the coconut ice cream - it was so delicious! Believe me, we did not go hungry. My daughter did get diarrhea from the 3rd day until we got home but the rest of is were ok. I tried to not drink too many of the tasty frozen drinks just in case.Now the reason I rated this a 5: the beach and the pool. I have been on many vacations and these were by far the very best I have ever seen. The pool was so big that it never seemed crowded and it was clean all the time. The temperature was perfect and the ledges in the water were ingenious for sunbathing. I didn't want to leave. Since there was so much grass and vegetation around the pool you didn't feel like you were in a hotel - it felt like paradise. The beach was also beautiful - the softest sand I have ever felt. The water was clear and blue although not as calm as I would have liked. And I have to say that this was the ONLY beach in the caribbean that I have been to that did not have the annoying locals trying to sell you hair braiding and jewelry - what a wonderful change!The kids club was a little dull but my kids only went to hang out with other kids so it was ok for them for a couple of days. At the beach and pool every day they brought a different animal for people to pose with and then purchase the pictures for $10 a piece. A little pricey but I'm glad I bought all 8 of them - a python, 2 different monkeys, 2 macaws and an iguana - pretty cool for the kids.We went to a couple of the shows but they were a little cheesy. I tried the casino and that was fun - won a little money too. The nightlife is not fantastic but we were happy to relax in the room and read or watch tv. Wanted to get up early anyway to enjoy the outdoors.All in all this was a great vacation if you can get past the little annoying things. I have been on cruises and to other caribbean islands but for a family of 5 this was the best value around. If you want to relax and sit by the pool and the beach this is the place for you!

<Content>LOVED Majestic Colonial This hotel resort was FAR above excellent. Everything is VERY clean and the staff will go out of their way for you. The spa was great and relaxed. I walked through the two neighboring resorts and the guests there were VERY different. At the Majestic Colonial, you can relax and have a good time withouth loud smokey drunk people. Yet, the drinks at the MC were excellent. Food was excellent. You CAN drink the water served w/ dinner. We had the most wonderful week there. Thank you Majestic Colonia!

<Content>Animation Dear animation-team from Majestic-Colonial!Heartly greatings from D眉sseldorf in Germany where the sun is shining ;) We had a great time (even thou the wheather wasn鈥檛 always caribbean-like) which was also due to your hard animation-work. And it鈥檚 not ironical, because there is nothing so difficult than to make people laugh and enjoy.We had much fun with aerobics (special thanks to Tyson, the 鈥渂oxer鈥? and his infectious energy), step-aerobics (thanks to Samual who made me think of Denzel Washington, the sweety), volley-ball and the dancing lessons (thank you, Jes煤s, because even my husband did appreciate, which is not so easy). A little bit of criticism: Lucy, try to be a bit more friendly and powerfull: animation is perhaps a hard job, but you don鈥檛 have to show it so much. I loved the disco, even thou the DJ seemed sometimes to make music for his own pleasure: I remember, once he played super-loud and hardest techno-music while there were only aged people (55-60) on the dancefloor, two minutes later they gave up and disappeared. It was a pity to see.The shows: the moderation from 鈥淪paghetti鈥?(sorry, I forgot the name) was very good and professional, but we missed a bit the change. Each week the same program is not so interesting for people who stay for two or more weeks in the hotel.I loved very much the three club-dances. The first, Taqui Taqui, I managed to find on the internet, the second, Follow the leader, I have on CD at home, but the third, Slide to the left and so, the coolest as I think, I couldn鈥檛 unfortunately find nowhere. I don鈥檛 know if you can answer, but if so, please, PLEASE, could you tell me the title and the interpreter?Many greatings and thanks once again fromKarin and Andreas

<Content>Great Time at the Majestic Colonial I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Majestic in Punta Cana. It was such a great vacation!!!! The hotel is only 14 months old and it is in perfect condition. The rooms were large and beautil. There is little privacy in the bathroom but it did not bother my friend or I. I could see how if you had small children there the bathroom privacy might be a problem. The grounds of the hotel are gorgeous. The hotel itself is in a horseshoe shape, with the beach at one end and the main lobby at the opposite end. In the middle is the pool, which runs throughout the entire center area of the hotel. There is a swim up bar, two areas with jacuzzi like bubbles and there is also a ledge where you can put your chairs and tan while in the water. It was very nice and remained very clean the entire time we were there. The spa offered some great things but we found the prices to be a little too much. The ocean and beach were amazing and it was not too hard to find a beach chair in the morning. There were activities onthe beach that were fun i.e. cocnut throwing contests, sand people contest, water areobics, stretching and many more. There were also activities by the pool that were fun to participate in.The animation team were very friendly and helpful. Tyeson, Samuel, Nelson, Julio, Lucy were all great people and add so much to the enviornment at the hotel. The sun in DR was sooooo hot remember to bring your SPF because in the store at the hotel it was about $18 for a bottle of it. A little too pricy.The food was great! The only resturante we did not enjoy was the Dominican. The seafood was great!!!! I did get sick one night but nothing a little imodium couldn't take care of.The staff were all very nice. The only staff we did not find very friendly was the staff in the mini mart.Thursday's the hotel has local vendors come on property so there is no need to go outside of the resort if you do not wish to. I loved my stay there it was as relaxing as I had hoped it to be!!!

<Content>A wonderful vacation! I travelled with my sister to this resort and it was our first time to the Dominican Republic. We read the reviews on tripadvisor.com and we were glad with our choice. It also helped set our expectations.Service: The service was great. Everyone was extra nice and they really made a genuine effort to make sure you are happy. The animation team were amazing. It's hard to describe how wonderful the staff was. It does help if you know Spanish but they were patient and they made every effort to make sure they understand if you made any requests. Casino/Disco Club: Casino is small but I like playing blackjack and I never had any problem waiting for a seat which was great if you like to gamble. The disco is small but probably the appropriate size for the resort as some nights it was not too busy. I am no longer a club type person so this did not matter to me.Rooms: I felt they were lovely and they were huge. It's true that there is a lack of privacy for the bathroom but I was with my sister so again this was not an issue for us but it would be an issue if you are travelling with someone that you are not comfortable with.Gym: There is a small gym there with new equipment. It was adequate for us. I only went once but my sister went three times and the trainer that was there was a cutie. :-DNightly Shows: They were ok. I thought the Couples show was funny and they put alot of effort in the Michael Jackson show. The Grounds: Absolutely beautiful. The pool is the full length of the resort and is nicely lit at night.Spa: I can not provide feedback here since I did not sign up for any services.Beach: Water was warm and the sand felt great under your feet. We did not have much problems finding a chair but perhaps it was due to the fact that we usually did not head to the beach until the afternoon.Restaurants: For breakfast and lunch we at at the buffet. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet because I am a crepe lover so I had that almost every morning with fruit and bacon.We ate at most of the restaurants for dinner except the Chinese (where no reservation is required). The Tepanyaki (sp) was entertaining. We loved the seafood restaurant and the steakhouse by the beach. I enjoyed the lobster and the chateaubriand at these locations. We both loved the buffet at the Mexican restaurant since it was the closest to island food (our nationality is Jamaican) and we ate here for two nights. The sweet potato there is awesome but the options vary slightly each night. The restaurant we would recommend that you stay away from is the french restaurant Le Gourmet. In the menu they offered Surf and Turf but after observing another patron taking aa few bites I decided to order the chicken entree which was ok. The shrimp appetizer was nice.Overall we were happy with the food, mainly because our expectations were not high based on reading reviews for several hotels in the DR.I also enjoyed the fact that we met several patrons from all over. I got the opportunity to practice my French and learned a little bit of Spanish while I was there. I like that international vibe.I would also recommend this place if you are considering getting married on a resort. After speaking with a couple of people who got married there that week they were very happy with their decision and felt that they had an absolutely beautiful wedding.I would definitely come back to the Majestic Colonial when I return to the DR and I would highly recommend this resort to anyone planning to come to the DR.

<Content>Great Hotel but Careful which Tour Operator! This was a very nice hotel as advertised. We found the staff lovely and attentive. Facilities are well kept and excellent. The food getsold (doesn't matter whether you use the restaurants or the buffet, It's essentially all the same) after a while. They did provide a goodassortment of fruit. Prepare to gain some weight.The old, 'towels on the chairs at the pool and the beach' is in strong force there. Gets tiring when you see people plodding down to the beach or pool at daybreak just to get the chairs they want. The biggest drawback is that you have little sense at all of the Dominican culture, unless you venture to the market just outside the hotel, in which case you see a very negative side of the culture withpushy and presumably desperate salespeople who will do nearly anything to get you to buy their trinkets. It's as if you are in a Dominican theme park in the US. If you are considering this hotel for its kids club, forget it! There is no Kids Club to speak of. There is a tired castle facility with two little water slides and a kiddie pool. Unless you want your kids playing video games all day or watching movies. The woman there doesn't even watch the kids - busy reading a book. She claimed there were daily activities but couldn't be more specific. Hmmm. There is no separation between older and younger kids, except the older ones can play video games. I didn't dare leave my children with the staff there, They don't greet them as they come in that I saw, in fact there is very little interaction at all. They just lookup from time to time to gaze at them in the pool and go back to reading. I am not exaggerating here!Above all, avoid GOGO tours. It took us 2 hours for them to get us from the airport to the hotel because they were waiting for other people and kept us sitting at the airport for 45 minutes then stopped at 5 hotels on the way. We rode in an old bus with attached trailer which had to slow down to 2 MPH to cross each speed bump. It was like riding in a tank! Then, their representative Hector, was hardly ever available. US Air lost our luggage and when we appealed to him for help he kept giving us the wrong information. Our bag finally arrived 2 days later in the middle of the night. At the end of our stay, he told us to catch a 12:00 bus going back tothe airport for a 3:00 flight. Bus finally shows up after 1:00- guesswhat? No seats available! Naturally, Hector is nowhere to be found. The hotel staff who were very helpful, offered to call a taxi for $35but we tried to hold out. Finally another GOGO bus arrives, takes us to 3 other hotels on the way, and we arrive at the airport after 2:00. We only make our flight after paying a $25 bribe for another tour operator to get us to the head of the US Air line, which is about 50 people long. He pays off the US Air agent, and we get on ourflight with minutes to spare. Nice hotel but lousy tour company.

<Content>Less than expected experience My family (sons ages 11 and 9, daughter 13, and my wife) stayed at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana from April 13th to April 19th 2007. From the reviews on this website, we thought that it would be beyond excellent, and were somewhat prepared for that; we didn't really receive that service, but I guess that is what you get for expecting too much.We arrived after a nice flight at the lobby to a great first impression. We were brought Majestics, the resort's signature drink, which set a tropical atmosphere. After this, though, things didn't go so well. We requested pool-side connected rooms preferably on the second row or higher, none of which were available. They gave us a set of keys for two rooms which they claimed were connected. Once we got to the rooms, we discovered just the opposite. Trip 1 from the lobby to a room and back to the lobby was completed.We were given another room set which was connected. They faced the forest; not exactly the view you would like going on a vacation like this. The next day we took trip 3 to change our room, where they changed us to first floor, connected, pool side rooms. We were promised that Sunday we would move to a fourth room, on the second floor and closer to the beach, exactly what we desired. Long story short: on Sunday, when I went to change the rooms, they had mistakenly given them away. Thus, we were stuck in first floor rooms right across from the ice machine and closest to the theater, so we could almost hear every word from the animation team each night, listen to people yelling outside our door at 2 in the morning, and count the number of ice cubes people craved at whatever time of day.The maids did a nice job; my daughter was able to tell them to please make the beds in spanish, as they speak one or two words in english.Our first night we ate at the steak restaurant, which was comparable to Peter Luger's in Brooklyn (no joke!!!!). The chateaubriand was excellent, as well as the brochettes and steak. We liked it so much that this was the one restaurant we opted to eat at twice.The second night my sons and I went to the seafood restaurant, which was unimpressive. My wife and daughter wanted to try le Gourmet, so we split up for the night. They said service was excellent, the atmosphere nice, but the food fair. When they asked if they could bring their desserts back to the room for us, the waiters brought brand new dishes back. Overall, this restaurant had the best service from their opinions.Next, we tried the chinese restaurant. Eating at 6:30, we were practically the only ones in the room; our food was out in an instant. It was pretty good. Soon, though, we were forgotten....It took what seemed like a week for our dessert to come after asking the waiters a few times.Monday we ate at the Mexican/Dominican restaurant. The service was absolutely HORRENDOUS. We arrived at 6:30, didn't receive drinks until 7, and menus until 7:15. Finally our dinner came at quarter of 8. The food was alright.Our final night, Wednesday, we ate at the hibachi. Make reservations the second you arrive, this was the first opening for reservations, which we made a couple hours after getting to the hotel. It was just like any restaurant in the US, only the fried rice was just a little different than the kids were used to.Breakfast was interesting; I never knew churros could be eaten at breakfast, but boy was I wrong!! The crepes were very good, as well as the omelettes. Lunch was the same, but we found that the beach shack had a a better lunch, the breakfast place just wasn't that great.We took the snorkeling trip one day from the hotel, which was a nice thing to do, especially to get the family ready for scuba diving. The advertisement leads one to believe that you get certified for $95 per person, which is not true. They required that I pay all the money 2 days ahead of time, so I walked down to the Bahia Principe and booked it there, paying right before the boat left for the dive. The people at Majestic's scuba hut were hard to work with, I found the Bahia people much nicer, as well as the fact that it was cheaper to take the dive there.As with any beach vacation, for us, 6 nights/7 days was too long...We stayed at Iberostar Puerto Plata 2 years ago for 4 nights/5 days, which was not quite long enough. (By the way, this was 10 times better.) The compromise will be our choice next time, as we were bored out of our mind by the final day.All in all, a nice experience, but we probably won't be going back.

<Content>Would Return Again We had the pleasure of spending almost 5 days at the Majestic this past week. Having done alot of research on this website, I had a good idea of what to expect and was not letdown. The staff was helpful, hardworking and pleasant. Our room was clean, spacious and had a great view of the pool and beach. We each had our favorite dining experience, my younger daughter loved the Steakhouse, my older enjoyed the Dominican cuisine. Each restaurant had a variety for everyone. The pool was beautiful and the ocean incredible. For those wanting to keep busy there is a track to jog around, a well equipped weight room, tennis and watersports. For those like myself, I brought a raft and a book and left Boston behind. We would return in a hearbeat!

<Content>Resort was beautiful but.... Resort was gorgeous, rooms were alright, alot of the staff dont understand english. Down fall was they cleaned the room different times of the day so if you wanted to have a nap you were intereupted. Dont need to tip all the time. Dont recommend the hair braiding if you are sensitive (we broke out from it). Pool was amazing, food was as expected for an island resort. Loved the steak house it was the best. ALERT On the Shopping - MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR PACKAGES BEFORE LEAVING THE STORE THAT WHAT YOU BOUGHT IS IN THE BAG. Vendor tried to rip me off and I had to go back an collect my goods the next day.Also if you go topless on the beach you do take a risk. We saw locals taking pictures of women with their camera phones. (You dont know what they are doing with those pictures)

<Content>We would go back again  We stayed at the resort at the end of March. Punta Cana in general isthe best place. This was our 2nd time there, so we knew in advance what to bring...and what not to bring... Let me first say TNT vacation has been great to all of us. Yes all of us... we had 4 couple go this year and they knew when we were in the room (thanks tobig papi)(Steve). One thing everyone should know before going here ismake sure you tip the staff. Understand that they live off of about $200.00 US a month. And if you tip they do remember who you are. Don't be cheap thinking it's all inclusive, it is but come on... We didn't see anyone leaving any type of tip. We even brought things like Red Sox hats and other things they can't get there like perfume.It's great to barter with. Ok lets start with the rooms. They are great, plenty on room to move around. We were in rm 4132 I think...We had views of everything, the pool, the gardens and the beach. We did a lot people watching and drinking out on the patio. I'm sure we were pretty loud with 8 peoplebut no one complained that we know of. We left house keeping $5.00 a day so she gave us what ever we needed. We also left money for the guy who stocked our mini bar, yes it's different people. The food, we were very impressed this time with the food, the last time we stayed at the Bavaro princes and my lived off of rice, bread and bottle water for the week. This time we even brought a hot plate with food in a can with us just incase. Needless to say it never came out of the suit-case. The steakhouse I think was the best (Ohma)we requested him 2 or 3 nights. We didn't have any problem getting into any of the restaurants. I think words travels pretty fast in resorts and if they know you tip them well; they WILL get you in.The Pool, We spent a lot of time a the pool it's so big that it seems to never be over crowed.The beach well what can you say they are so nice and you can snorkel right there just follow the rope and let the water take you. It's awesome. We used to bread rolls from lunch and the fist come right up to you. Pictures, between all of us we have about a 1,000 pictures so if you would like to see some just send me an email. peter-darlene@comcast.netThere is also a professional photographers that will follow you around for about an hour and take pictures of you and you don't even have to buy them, I highly recommend this, they are great and really know what they are doing, I loved them all!What we brought with us, well everything but the kitchen sink. From medical supply items to my owe juice and Dunkin's coffee, we even putour cream in our freezers the night before and brought it with us. They don't get their milk from cows. So if you're use to that you may want to bring your own. I had an entire small suit-case just for liquids. All in All this resort is top notch!

<Content>Nice place to be All the good things written in other reviews are true, the resort is a wonderful place to be if you do not mind small things, like problems with room service - there was never 3 hand towels( we had 3 people in the room), or no bottled water in the minibar, or your toothbrash trown away, or the table not cleaned up. To give management a credit - you call room service and they'll bring you requested stuff right away - but after calling few times for different reasons it gets annoying... The minibar is not stuffed for deluxe resort - no nuts, chocolates, they only make sure you have 2 beers in there daily. Oh, no one mentioned it - the resort do not provide body lotion, only shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, so make sure you bring your own, which is inconvenient with current flight rules if you do not check in your luggage. If anyone wants to know - there is plenty of taxis to take you to-from the hotel and airport, cost $35 and it's 30-35 minutes ride. Food is OK, but talking to people from other resorts - it's not something outstanding anywhere around. However, if you have a kid that craves for Wendy's type food - it's only available at the airport and is twice expensive compare to the US. At the end - resort grounds are beautiful and well maintained, but the best place is the beach, compare with the surrounding resorts it is less crowded and calm.

<Content>My favourite so far We stayed for two weeks in a standard room from March 25 - April 8, 2007. As per the other reviews, the Majestic is a great hotel. I've stayed at eight other all inclusives in the Caribbean and this was by far my favourite to date.Pros: Lots of variety in food so that you're never bored and can always find something you like. Also it is offered frequently so thatif you want a snack or don't eat at the usual times, you can always find something. Drinks were good, lots of fresh fruit and smoothie offerings. Pool was fantastic and large. Beach was beautiful. We snorkelled right off of it in the coral although there is a great sandy area to swim as well. Chairs were rarely hard to come by no matter the time of day although sometimes shade was at a bit of a premium. I loved having internet available in my room for a charge of10$ US per day. We didn't do it everyday but it was fun to have from time to time. The room is beautiful and big. We didn't use the jacuzzi as much as we expected due to the fact that the water in it wasn't all that warm. I'm assuming this was due to the fact that in the evening many people are using them as well and it puts a drain onthe hot water available. Even showers before dinner were a little cool. The shower itself is big and beautiful. The open concept bathroom didn't bother us but there is definately a lack of privacy that may be a little disconcerting to some. Grounds are well kept and beautiful. The workers were constantly changing and maintaining the plantlife. Even a new concrete walkway appeared by the towel booth overnight.Cons: Cleaning staff was a bit awkward in that they either came by our room at 9am or 5pm. It made sleeping in a bit difficult. However, this could have been the location of our room. Perhaps they either started with us or ended with us. Stores on site are very expensive but they do bring in a market every Thursday where you can bargain and there is a permanent one available just outside the hotelgates. I can bargain as well as anyone but one aspect of the Dominican that I don't fancy is that vendors can be very aggressive.The available excursions are lacking in Punta Cana but that is no fault of the tour operators, more the area. We went on Caribbean Festival (200$ CDN for two people) and a horse backriding tour with RN23 (90$ CDN for two people) and didn't find either to be worth the money. For first timers to a Caribbean location though i'm sure they would be fine.All and all a fine resort and deserving of the #1 rating it has on Trip Advisor. Definately a 5 star to which I would return.

<Content>Great time Great weather We were at the Majestic Colonial From April 2nd to 9th with both our kids and a wedding party. We travel to the Carribean atleast once a year so I will try to make some comparrisons with other resorts.Airline:We traveled with Sunwing out of Saint John NB, after a slow start ie fuel truck ran out of fuel and someone forgot to remove the boarding stairs (left us sitting on the tarmack for an hour) we had a good flight, flight crew was great and flight was smoth but movie was poor both ways. We were also an hour late leaving Punta Cana. About as comfortable as any other charter service we have used. Nice comfy motor coach with A/C that didnt keep us waiting long to leave the airport where customs was quick and smooth. Check in was quick and front desk staff were great. Room: #3328 We paid for a regular gardenview but got a pool view and if you looked hard enough through the palm trees you could see the ocean. Room was beautiful and spacious even with the extra cot in it witch was more comfortable than the other two queen sized beds. Problems: It had a musty smell all week that a candle and opening the doors didnt help. For such a new resort there were allot of poorly done repairs and the maid service was poor she even missed us one day even though we tipped.We don't spend allot of time in the room so it wasnt worth the hastle of moving although I am sure they would have moved us. Also had some small red ants just like every other place in the Caribbean. The bathroom layout was odd but it didnt bother us the shower doubled as a change room. We had larger rooms at Breezes Varadero and a 4.5 star in Jamaica but they were older buildings.Pool:This was by far the most incredable pool we have ever been to, it was over a kilometer long and 4 feet deep throughout. you could walk from the lobby to the beach in the pool. It was busy and fun in places and quiet and relaxing in other spots.Food:The food was good overall but we had better food at the 4.5 star in Jamaica. We have had better buffet food in 4 star resorts in Cuba but the other restraunts were excelent except for the Chinese, the Japanese and the Mexican were excelent and the steak and seafood restraunts were good too. The beach grill was a big disapointment for us, always love the beach grill but had better food in every other place including a 3.5 star in Cuba.Drinks:By far the best drinks we have had, very close to the drinks at the 4.5 star in Jamaica except for the beer in the mini bar that is the worse beer I have ever forced myself (lol) to drink.Service:By far the best service we have ever had except for the maid.Beach:Was great, fine white sand with few rocks, comparable to Varadero butfiner sand with more palm and coconut trees here. Very good snorkeling right in front of the resort, (better than all other resorts we have been to with the exception of a 3.5 star in Purto Plata) we saw a stingray, an Octopuss and dozens of colorful fish. You could walk for miles on the beach in either direction.Off Resort:We wernt hassled near as much as we were in Jamaica, vendors were agressive but not as bad as others we encountered in PurtoPlata. Feltsafe in the day walking along secluded beach, we did encounter a guy with a shot gun but he turned out to be some kind of security for a resort under construction, still not the best feeling as he wasnt identified very well. Can't compare to off resort in Varadero and is why we keep going back there, no one hasleing you and it is safe to ride a scooter or rent a car day or night.In short we had a great time with no big complaints, I would go back anytime but we usually go somewhere different every year.

<Content>3rd Trip to Punta Cana, 1st at Majestic - Wonderful! This was our 3rd trip to Punta Cana, but our first stay at the Majestic Colonial, which was highly recommended by our travel agent. The travellers were me and my husband and our two sons, ages 5 and 8 months, and we all loved it and had such a fun, relaxing, stress-free family vacation there.The resort is wonderful - it is so clean and beautifully landscaped, the rooms were spacious and comfortable, pool was amazing, restaurants, food and service were great (I have a terrible stomach and I did not get sick once during my whole stay there and was so happy about that! I know I stayed well because all the food was sooo fresh and homemade on the premises and there were so many healthy selections. I think that my son even ate healthier than at home.). The beach was beautiful as it is all over Playa Bavaro, although this time there was much more surf than we expected, as we had been in Punta Cana before and the water was much calmer and was much better for children, who could just sit in the beautiful and not be knocked over as they were on this trip. (My husband attributed the stronger surf to the resort's location on the tip of the island, but I don't know if that's actually the case.). The activities were fun, especially the beach aerobics, aqua gym and beach volleyball. We all enjoyed the nightly shows, even the kids. The shops were nice too, although a bit pricy. The spa was wonderful - my husband and I both did massages and they were fabulous and I did a pedicure and it was nice. The spa is clean and very professional and I would highly recommend it.Only complaints are minor ones.1. The rooms - there are no tissue boxes and that was annoying. This is a small investment that the resort should make that would a big difference.2. Also in the room - the garbage cans are small and sleek and look nice, but they are totally impractical and don't fit anything. One diaper in the pail and it was full. They need to buy better garbage receptacles.3. The bridges - this is my major complaint - all of the bridges over the pool had stairs. This is totally impractical and totally unfair for families with strollers and people with physical disabilities or in wheel chairs. The resort we had gone to before - Barcelo Palace - had similiar bridges over the pools and they were built ramp style. I strongly recommend that the resort look into amending this situation by changing at the very least one of the bridges into a ramp to be used by those with strollers or wheelchairs.Overall I give this resort a 5 star rating and would definitely recommend it to family and friends and go back again.

<Content>A piece of Paradise My wife and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial from April 2nd through 7th, and had a wonderful experience. The architecture and landscaping are breath-taking. We had a standard room with an open-floor layout overlooking their large, serpentine pool, with a king sized bed and a jacuzzi tub. I thought the room was a great value, in and of itself.The staff is a standout. English is problematic for many of them, but they make up for it with their warmth and effort. We were greeted at check-in with Majestics, pink cocktails that took all the edge off the usual angst one experiences on arrival. After we entered our room, a housekeeper brought us a complimentary bottle of champagne.The food was plentiful. We were not overwhelmed by the Gourmet restaurant, but the others were very good, particularly the steakhouse and Taino, a restaurant with traditional Dominican and Mexican cuisine. After dinner, a small band plays at an outdoor patio where couples can dance to traditional Latin music, plus popular favorites played with a Latin accent. It is as romantic and idyllic as it sounds.My quibbles were few. The air conditioning in the workout room was broken, a defect that I am certain has been fixed by now. We couldn't get washcloths on a couple of occasions, but were able to remedy that later in the day. Overall, however, we came looking for a rest, and got exactly what we came for. I would recommend the hotel in a heartbeat. We cannot wait to return.

<Content>Awesome Vacation We were at the Majestic Mar 7 - 14, 2007 with a group of 22 for our daughter's wedding. Our AMA travel agent was fantastic and we were booked with Air Transat. The only issue with our travels was the flight there was horrbile. The seats (as on all charter flights) were extremely small and the meals were terrible. I'd strongly suggest upgrading to club class, it would have been well worth it. The return flight wasn't as bad becaue it was direct, on time and we didn't eat the food.The resort was awesome, grounds were clean and exactly as shown on the website. The pool was fantastic, lots of chairs and huts, never an issue. The service at the pool was good however I think the waitress worked another location as she generally disappeared during the lunch hours. The beach was good, always clean, lots of room.Room was great....although we got our daughters upgrade to a suite so it was really large!! The outdoor jacuzzi was great.The buffet was excellent, great food, great service and a nice atmosphere. All of the other restaurants were excellent as well.We really enjoyed the nightly entertainment and the evening music at the patio bar.The wedding from start to finish was wonderful. The gazebo was beautiful and the entire thing was very well organized by the weddingcoordinator. The reception was at the grill and was great. Excellentservice and cordined off nicely for our group. We went to the disco afterwards for the dance which was great.The shops were great, lots of them and really no reason to go out of the resort to the market. The thursday night market was good but of course the guys are really pushy.This was our first all inclusive vacation and we would definitely go back to this resort and Punta Cana. It was a fantastic trip all around.

<Content>GO!!!!! My wife and I are regular vacationers to the DR, but the first time that I felt compelled to write a review. The Majestic Colonial was our 7th trip there and our 6th resort, always at 5 star all inclusive resorts. If you are considering the Dominican Republic for the first time a word of warning...the Majestic will make many other resorts disappointing. We have thoroughly enjoyed every place we have been, but we have found the perfect place for us. We will be back next year.Compared to many resorts here's what they do not have:- no waiting for a trolley to go to the beach, diner, a bar, or the disco;everything is within a 10 minute or less walk (or stumble)- no limit to the use of the 6 a la carte restaurants and only 2 need reservations...most resorts limit you to once per week and usually always require that you reserve- no worries about the quality and variety of food; this may sound odd, but everything tastes like it is supposed to; regulars to the DR will know what I mean- no need to be the first up in the morning to get a towel, beach or pool lounger- no one with their hand out every minute looking for a tip, a word of advise, tip for great service that I know you will get...not to get better serviceI do not need to detail all of the things that were great, simply to say that from rooms, service, food, beach etc. this is a place you should try...with one exception, I would be seriously doing you a disservice if I did not mention some very special people at the Majestic. Trust me on this you will not find a better team of Animation or Bartenders anywhere!Do not watch everyone else participating with the Animation team, you will miss out on a truly great opportunity to meet some fantastic people and they will add to your fun.If you go to the Majestic look for my amigos...Sandy, Rey, Nelson, Pablo, Jesus, Samuel, Tyson, Andres, Moril, Luci, OrchadiaYou will find them working hard every day around the main pool bar, at the show, at the disco...everywhere all day long and always smiling and joking and never forgetting your name. You will miss out on an important part of the Majestic if you these beautiful people.And then there OUR bartenders Ernesto, Ismael, and Dominicia from the main pool bar...coffee ready for me at 7:00 am and knowing exactly what I needed later in the day...at the main lobby bar Juan 1 and Juan 2...you just can not get better service anywhere!We have stopped looking for the perfect place in the DR for us...it is the Majestic Colonial.....Sandy, Rey, Nelson, Pablo, Jesus, Samuel, Tyson, Andres, Moril, Luci, Orchadia, Ernesto, Ismael, Dominicia, Juan 1  2...see you next year!

<Content>Majestic - wow! This is a fairly lengthy review, but we really appreciate all the other reviews people post - it greatly influences our choices of resorts and hotels when we travel. We were a family of 4 (incl 2 teenagers) who stayed at the Majestic March 21 - 28. In summary, we had a fantastic vacation. We were looking for relaxation and escape from hectic schedules, and we found it. The beach is amazing, the water warm and the waves great for boogie boarding. The pool is incredible - just pick your spot based on how much exercise you want (i.e. the distance to get to the swim-up bar). Those multiple trips to the swim-up bar, and long walks on the beach were the only exercise I got.The rooms are beautiful - quite luxurious. We found the bed very comfortable and we slept quite well. The only complaint is that the toilet in the room could be made a bit more private (they should use solid doors and walls from floor to ceiling). We enjoyed the big jacuzzi tub - especially because our kids had a separate room...). We were in first floor rooms in the 4000 block - close to the beach and the pool. Very quiet with a nice open courtyard with fountains outside. At the back, we had a view of the ocean through the trees on the adjacent vacant lot. We had asked for two nearby rooms - one with two double beds (for our kids) and one with a king bed (for us - yeah baby!). We got exactly the configuration we asked for, and the two rooms were adjacent - perfect.The staff was generally very friendly and helpful. Certainly friendlier service than we get in North America. Although they all speak pretty good english, I tried speaking a little spanish with them - either they truly appreciated it or they are just amused by my ham handed efforts. In terms of the attentative service, I'll givean example. The patio door to our kid's room wouldn't lock properly when we arrived our first day at 7 pm. We called the front desk, and they had two maintenance people fixing it within 30 minutes. Based onNorth American or European experiences, I was expecting that they might get to it the next day.The food was overall excellent. The main buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner had great variety and freshness. The beach restaurant/steakhouse had a pretty good lunch buffet as well, but not quite as varied as the main buffet. For dinner, we tried the steakhouse twice - both times the chateaubriand. It was excellent. As tender as any beef we've had in Canada. We also tried the Teppanyaki, which was also excellent as well as entertaining. We went to the Taino (Mexican) restaurant twice. Both times we had the Steak Tempequena (spelling?) which was very tender and tasty. None of us got sick on any of the food except one night I had a raw fish appetizer at the Gourmet restaurant, which didn't agree with me. I don't eat raw fish at home either, so it probably wasn't the smartest thing to do. I wasfine by the next morning, so clearly nothing too serious. The gourmet restaurant was otherwise ok, but probably our least favourite.The drinks were great - we tried many, including some I've never heard of. Marta at the bar by the lobby end of the pool creates some concoctions of her own that are worth trying - just ask her for something unique and tropical. The ladies bringing drinks by the poolwere also great - never left us thirsty. We found that by tipping a couple of bucks here and there made a difference - they'll remember you day to day and come back frequently to make sure you have what you need. We tipped our housekeeping a couple of bucks per day - I don't know if it resulted in any extra service, but to these people those few extra dollars a day makes a huge difference. We did get extra pillows when we asked, so that wasn't a problem.The shows were good - at least we don't expect Las Vegas headliner stuff, but they certainly put in a great effort. We went to 3 of them(including the famous Michael Jackson tribute show). Many evenings we would just sit on a lounger on the beach with a drink, listening to the waves and gazing at the stars. It's a very romantic spot.This review wouldn't be complete without mentioning Majestic Mike at customer service. My wife and I celebrated our 20th anniversary with a small ceremony of renewing our vows on the beach. It was at sunset and Mike officiated the ceremony - I didn't ask to see his religious credentials. Anyway, Mike wrote up the vows for us to exchange, including our two kids in the ceremony. I had met with him earlier to give him a bit of info about us and from that he did it all himself. He seemed to genuinely enjoy doing it - not like it was just his job. The ceremony was a very touching moment and broughttears to our eyes. Mike also came to say goodbye when we were checking out. It is that kind of personal service and attention that makes the Majestic stand out in my mind. Thanks, Mike!!As you can guess from the above, we would definitely go back. If you're looking for relaxation or romance, or both, this is the place. If you want to be more active, then you can do that too - the animation team has an energy level that amazes everyone.

<Content>Wonderful resort and great coffee, outstanding staff but!!!!!!! We had read much about the resort on trip advisor and really did not know what to expect-We got hit at the airport for a 10 fee. The turinter buses were on time but rather old and disheveled. I tried to book the Japanese restaurant as soon as we arrived but it was already sold out! I tried a cash incentive but that did not work either.Junior suite was lovely-close to the beach and poolside-try to get a 4th floor room as the hall traffic is minimum. The extra room that the suite has really should have a half bathroom but does not. It does have an extra minibar and safe. the bathroom is very narrow-It was always a struggle to get extra towels but we tipped the houecleaning 2 dollars a night which seemed to do the trick. The coffee in our room was outstanding (ask for an expresso machine)Beach is wonderful and clean-However if you want a beach hut-be prepared to save the chairs at 7:30 AM or you will be shut outThe gym is anemic with 10 cardio machines but very few other ameneties. The spa was so empty that they had a recruiter near the pool. We were able to book appointments that day and the staff was wonderful. The pool is magnificent. There is a stealth sauna and steam room just outside of the spaThe food was standard fare with the alacarte restaurants far superior. A few dollars in tips at dinner or at the bars goes a long way. The casino was tiny My only complaint-If you are accustomed to traveling in luxury such as the four seasons or the ritz carlton/fairmont you will be in for a rude awakening. The crowd is a very different clientele-about a quarter of the men were tattood, smoking and obesity ran rampant and about 50% of the guests were foreign. Only a few women were topless and they were mostly mature europeans.All in all-Great people-nice resort-but not a five star resort by any stretch

<Content>Had a wondeful time at Majestic..April 1, 2007 Just a quick note to review the Majestic. We returned April 1, 2007 after a one week stay. We had a fabulous vacation. Having vacatoned in Punta Cana several times in the past ( Paradisus Punta Cana) we decided because of a good price we found on Cheapcarribean.com to try the majestic., glad we did. The resort is beautiful and immaculate. The pool as posted is just fantastic and the most appeaing part is if you desire to be near the music and activity staff you can do that..but if you desire quiet or less crowds there are so many plcaes along this pool to sit..and bars near every seat. One thing we liked about this resort were the convenience of so many bars..thus never waited for a drink. Drinks were perfect..the call liquor or lack thereof was NOT an issue..and they would always add more alcohol if you request that of them. Wine..ehh..not so good..but there is a wine list.yet we opted to stick to mixed drinks and beer. Drinks were delicious and plentiful and at most bars outside of the pool..you received nice glasses..martini, rocks etc...and always with appropriate fruit or olives etc. The bartenders are exceptional..so tip them they work very hard with no incentive. Dominican people are the happiest I have ever encountered..and this continues to be proven true at Majestic. The wait staff, room janitorial staff, activity etc...above excellent. Lots of managers on site..a very smooth operation. Food was perfect..it is not what you might find at your favorite restaurant at home but it is absolutely very good and delicious. Room service menu is only avaialble in upgraded rooms..but not worth it. or I should dsay we chose not to use it but the first day.very limited menu..the pumpkin soup though is delish ( also available at the gourmet restaurant). All restaurants are excellent..ans the buffet is the largest and freshest I have found at a comparable resort..just delicious and something for everyone. The buffet dinig room is very large and beautiful..an enjoyable venue for a buffet. Steer clear of hamburgers ( not sure what meat it is..tasted odd and never cooked completely..and the calamari rings..and hot dogs ) probably wondering why we ate those at all? we arrived late day and it was the only available food at that time ( before dinner) we ate this at the ocean fron restaurant Hispainola...it was a mistake..do not eat these items if you do not want to get sick...But everything else was excellent..dessert great, meats great etc etc pasta station also delsih and fresh! Try the paella...one of the best buffet items ( would love that recipe..do not htink it contains seafood..but excellent) anyway all in all food and drinks are perfect. we had 2 1/2 days of rain..( it happens) but had a lovely stay anyway..played alot of cards! They brought apps out in the lobby during that time to keep people occupied..good idea! The activity team also moved their plans inside...very good. The evening shows are fine..if you like that stuff...theatre is beautiful with waitress service..but the shows get old I thought..but we went to several of them. Need to get there early on the popular show nights to get a seat iof the resort is full like it was last week. Casino is quite small but fun. Especially enjoyed the auto roulette..this was FUN.Try it! Sports Bar/Disco is nice pool tables in there and big TV ( great to watch NCAA action)...we did play tennis and they had equipment to borrow..fun! they are building a baseball diamond right now too. Our biggest complaint is rteally not alot of places to walk ( I mean to take a long walk..besides the baech)...loved that about paradisus..but that may not affect you at all. Beach is gorgeous..do set you clock for 615 to catch a sunrise on the beach ..very special. Beach has lots of tiki huts and shade..never a prob at beach or poll finding chairs or shade. we did the ATV excursion ( used the guys at the booth near the waterfront rest. ) lots of fun...tried to fo deep sea fishing but it was either booked or the waters too rough while we were there. The spa is great and very beautiful and quite reasonable. have Lydia do your pedicure she does a great job! Gym is small ( only one treadmill) and was crowded...decide to wait til we got back home instaed of hanging around for who knows how long to get the machines. Rooms are just like the other posts say. The jacuzzis on thepatio are NOT hot tubs but jacuzzi bathtubs..oh well. We did use our 2 nights after 11 when the patio lights turned off automaticallly ( resort controls these, no switch in your room)..but it was beautiful at night to use the jacuzzi. The inside jacuzzi tub is fabulous but they woulddo well to maybe add a pull down shade or curtain of sorts..and the bathroom...raelly could use to have the door go floor to ceiling..but it is what it is, so make do. Otherwise the rooms are gorgeous and very comfy and luxurious..all marble. Our room 2126 was in the middle of the resort and pooside..great locatrion.. All in all..we would go back in a minute. Very relaxing, excellent service, food and expereince. The price was right too..much much less than Paradisus..( but remember paradisus charges more prob because golf is included..and that adds up) but for a neww resort they are doing an excellent job! we liked!!! any questions you may write me at pixiefinn@aol.com..happy to help you. we booked flight and room thru cheap carribean from Boston to Punta cana.

<Content>Stayin Solo at the Majestic I travelled solo to Punta Cana and I must say the staff at the Majestic made me feel at home. The animation team were fabulous and extremely friendly - special thanks to Nelson, Ordiyllea and Ray for making this trip amazing... I found this resort to be great in providing laughs thru games and activities.. by the beach or the poolside.. The food was great and i liked the selection provided. The rooms were beautiful and spacious... the beds arent that stiff... i still had a great night sleep.The resort was clean, tidy and orderly. I would definately recommend this resort to anyone who is looking for a nice escape for their vacation.

<Content>An experience to remember! We have recently returned from a one week stay at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana resort. I have never had so much fun in my entire life. Not only was the food awesome and the service as well, but the animation group was especially out of this world. I have been to Punta Cana three times, and many other places around the world, and i have never seen such amazing animation. They truly surpassed my expectations. I was alone, with my parents on vacation, i am 17 years of age, and i thought that it would not be that interesting. However, because of the animation at this place, i had the time of my life. The animators are always willing to entertain you and make your stay extremely enjoyable. They interact with people of all ages; from children to the elderly! A special thanks to Francisco, who is honestly out of this world AWESOME, and always makes the shows and every day fun! Also, Sandy is extremely fun!

<Content>majestic is excellent Stayed at the majestic in the middle of march 2007, and had a wonderful experience. The resort grounds were kept in impeccable shape, I never once saw a piece of trash.The rooms were very modern, the shower was very nice. Despite the large number of rooms at the resort, I never once felt crowded, be it at the beach or the bar. The few negative reviews I read while researching the trip were way off, the pillows were fine, and the food was great. The breakfast buffet was outstanding, as well as the surf and turf at the french restaraunt. I would return to this resort in a heartbeat, perfect for a romantic getaway with my girlfriend. I would not fly on US AIRWAYS ever again, lost 25 hours of my 4 night trip in philadelphia airport.

<Content>The best place so far! I have been to the Majestic with my husband from March 11 to March 18 2007. This place is absolutely perfect. The food was great, the fact that you do not need reservation for the steak house and the seafood restaurant makes your life much easier, there are a lot of palapas on the beach there is no need to get up early to reserve a nice spot. The rooms are nice except that there is not much privacy in the bathroom if you are with children or among friends. The service is just fantastic. I traveled a lot to Cuba, Hawaii and I have never seen so many employees and so much service. They are very friendly and helpful. I prefer the beach in Cuba but it is still very nice I would strongly recommend this place and would certainly love to go back. The only negative thing is that we had to come back Oh and the internet was down.

<Content>Beautiful Beach!! This was our first time at an all -inclusive resort so we have nothing to compare it to. But all-in-all we had a great time.Room: When we checked in it went smoothly and we recieved a ocean/beach view room on the second floor. Not knowing which area to ask for we were pleased with it's location-close to the beach! Friends we were with got a great garden floor room facing the beach, which they loved. The rooms are pretty, but be careful of slippery shower floor-I almost went down a couple of times. Pillows are too thin, and only one bath towel per person.(I'm sure you could ask for more). The first full day we were there the maid didn't show up until 5:45pm. So when she came we promised a good tip each day if room was done by noon.Presto-a clean room by noon each day! Also left small tip each day for young man who stocked the fridge.Beach: Beautiful!!!! No seaweed our week-just clear, blue water. We love the ocean so we were in it a lot. Only went to the pool once, just for swim up bar. Beautiful pool too, but we're beach people. I was up at the beach by about 7:30 a.m. to claim a thatched umbrella and chairs. Just put your towels across them and fold down the backs. We snorkled right off the beach and saw lots of fish. Fun to go get a cocktail and sit and sip while relaxing. Our favorite drink: caibineta(sp.?)-similar to a mojito. The creamy drinks too sweet and thick for us. A friend and I joined the beach excercise class a few times-yoga and cardio. Quite a workout. Activities: My husband golfed a couple of times at different courses. One that was quite beautiful right on the water. We did walk up the beach to the flea market-took us about 45 min. each way. Got most of our trinkets there, as the prices were good if you bartered. Also did the Marinarium with 3 other couples and had fun. Snorkled in a pen with ray's and nurse sharks. Was told the poisonous barbs are removed from the rays(makes sense)so don't be afraid. It was a fun 1/2 day outing. The boating staff are very enthusiastic and sweet.Food: Well, not as bad a some of the reviews made it out to be. I didn't eat beef and stuck to seafood and chicken. We didn't gain any weight, that's for sure. The best restaurant for us on site was the Japanese Steakhouse. Made a reservation when we arrived at the hotel and the soonest available was the night before we left. It was great, though. Ate at Le Gourmet-I had chicken, but just like boiled chicken. The others a beef dish they said was o.k. We lunched mostly at the buffet by the beach-not bad. If you go to main buffet there is much more to chose from. Wish we'd done that a little more often. Breakfast is pretty good. Fruit is great. But the last day or two of our stay the fruit was less plentiful. One night we did venture off site to a restaurant by a beach 30 min. away. It was an interesting place with delicious seafood. We went with 8 other people in one taxi. One of the people knew someone who lived in Punta Cana and it was recommended. A couple of hairy moments on the way home,but lots of fun.We enjoyed ourselves and were able to have fun and relax. Not sure we'd go back, because we like to rent a car and explore areas we visit on our own, and you can't do that there. But we did have a wonderful time.

<Content>Animation team is the best!!! The animation team are great!! They keep you entertained all day and night long. Even though it was quiet at night the animation team kept the party going until the late evening. We had two waiters that were a great help ( Nokel and Felix), they made are days and nights from taking care of us at the beach and in the gourmet restaurant. The shows were great , the rooms were wonderful, the pool is huge with some quiet spots and the beach is picture perfect. We will return!! Great time!!

<Content>Just okay First of all, I stayed at the Majestic from March 8 鈥?14 along with 33 other people who attended my sister in-laws wedding. It was my first visit to Punta Cana. It was an okay trip but I don鈥檛 think I will be going back to Punta Cana anytime soon. I would advise you not to go into town unless you go on an excursion. I would defiantly bring snacks and toiletries items with you. The resort is very expensive. A small can of chips and a candy bar will cost you $5.00. Also sun tan lotion will run you $17.00. Rooms: Really nice for a couple. However, the room is not comfortable for a family of four. . There isn't really any private space to change unless you go in the shower or the bathroom stall. The room is kept clean and if you want your sheets changed you鈥檒l need to tip the house keeper and leave a note in Spanish. Also, for extra bottle water tip the man who delivery it not the cleaning lady. I gave him $10.00 for the whole week and I had plenty of water in my room.Food: It was okay. I am not a picky eater and I can eat almost anything. However, I did not care for the buffets. The group I traveled with is use to Spanish and Portuguese cuisine for which tends is rich. However, some people in the group did have digestive problems. Please be careful, at the buffets because if it looks like they refried some of the food. I would stay away from the Mexican Buffet if you are not use to rich foods. The other restaurants were good (especial, the Steak House and the Seafood). Drink lots of bottle water (even to brush your teeth). Beach: Great! It was a beautiful beach but the water was kind of choppy. I have visited a lot of Caribbean islands and it was one of the nicest beaches I have seen. However, Bermuda is still the best. Pool: Awesome! It was a beautiful 鈥渉uge鈥?pool (one of the best I have ever seen).Staff: The bar tenders at the pool were awesome. I would suggest tipping them if you want to be served before anyone else. The active staff was great (very friendly). The employee who works behind the receptionist desk 鈥渘eeds a personality adjustment鈥? It took us 3 days to get a wheel chair for a family member. Apparently, they did not have enough wheel chairs for people who needed them. I give them a C- for customer service. We did not have a problem with the language since some of us could speak Spanish fluently. Children鈥檚 Programs: Sucks! That鈥檚 all I can say. I would not leave my four year old. Wedding: It was a beautiful wedding. It was definitely one of the best weddings I have ever attended. Airport/Bus: When arriving at the Airport get ready to pay a $10.00 tax per person (including infants). We booked through Cheap Caribbean and the bus that they use for transportation needs to be updated Overall, the hotel was beautiful. But, the all inclusive was just okay... I guess I just expected and wanted more. It is definitely not a 5 start. They need to do a lot of work before they can call them selves a 5 star hotel I would give them 3 陆 to 4 stars tops.

<Content>NOT so hot This is not run like a 4 or 5 star resort. The beach is fabulous-- similar to Bermuda pink sand. Facilities average for the most part: room is large with deep jacuzzi tub out in the open; shower is spacious; toilet is claustrophobic; two sinks. Towels are at a premium, especially face cloths. Beach towels need to be returned to hut, but often runs out of clean replacements. Housekeeping standards are fair.Food is cafeteria style with no variations to salad bar (you too can learn to love shredded cabbage) includes decent ceviche. We were very disappointed with fish/seafood offerings. No made to order fresh dishes. Sitting around makes the fried, baked options very mealy, unappetizing. Best get beef at night. Local food at Taino tasty. Skip the sushi and French altogether -- it's a waste of time. Breakfasts have extensive offerings. Mini croissant and fruit are outstanding.Local beer is good. Mixed drinks use bottom shelf liquor. Ask for Barcelo (sp?) rum at no extra charge. Patrons were not typically binge drinkers--lots of Europeans  Canadians who seem to hold their alcohol well. Bachelor/ette flings are raucus affairs. Weddings go on every day at various venues.The entertainment is uninspired though the jazz sax was good.Our major complaint is with administration. Our toilet's fresh water hose sprung leaks on two different occasions, oth in the middle of the night. First time they fixed the hose; the second they turned off the water and we had to wait until the next morning to get it fixed. I'll spare you the frustrating details except to tell you that they never apologized for my slipping and doing a back landing when I went to investigate the sound of rushing water that first night. I slipped on the wet, glassy-surfaced floortiles and hit the back of my head on the tub. They refused to cover a medical check to ensure I didn't have repercussions from the blow to the back of my head. Very disagreeable front desk staff and manager.The weather was consistently beautiful during our ten-day stay in February/March 2007.

<Content>Best all-around all-inclusive Majestic March 9th-16thOur backround,we have stayed at many all-inclusives,which I think is important in giving a fair evaluation of a property,for comparison purposes, Sandals, Secrets, Royal Hideway, Riu Palace, Dreams,Iberostars,Barcelo ColonialWe booked thru beachdestinations.com with transfers. Solar tour/connect services rep was waiting with a sign for us.We waited for one more group and then headed for the resort about 45 min ,including dropping them off at Riu.Check-in: room wasn't ready untill 3 as expected,so we changed and headed to the beach,they just hold your luggage at the front,no problem.Came back at 3, the room was ready.Room: we were suppose to have garden view ended up with oceanview right next to the beach 3246(inside view)The room was excellent. It is very large and has plenty of space for storage,there are drawers in the vanity.The air conditioning has an adjustment next to the nightstand, ver y convienent.Food: The breakfast buffett ,wasn't the largest selection of fruit pastry, but it was enough. They did make fresh omelettes and depending on what time you go to breakfast,it wasn't a long wait.We ate at the steakhouse the most, everything we had there was very good,the seafood restaurant is actually one side of the same bld,but they will not give you seafood at the steak house or vica-versa.So we ate the steakhouse and when it came time for dessert we walked to the other side got a table ordered 2 lobsters(I don't eat seafood) and when it came I gave it to my husband and went up and got dessert off the buffett.We did that 3 ngts.The gourmet restaurant was excellent we had the beef wellington(surf and turf)they actually hollow out the center of the filet and stuff it with lobster,again I gave the lobster to my husband)Lunch: We tried the main buffet once and then decided it wasn't really any better than the beach buffet so we just ate down there.Pool: As everone says it is really nice,the water was also very comfortable.Beach: Great! We walked both directions for at least an hour each way,you could have walked forever.There is a small section with seaweed, it is no big deal. There is no rocks to be foundMosquitos: I never saw oneEntertainment: In the courtyard in front of the lobby they had different bands or the sax with a keyboard player untill about 10 we enjoyed this more than the shows,people were dancing,it was nice.Shows: We only went to the Michael Jackson,but after a few songs, I was bored so we left.Casino: We went a couple of nights and played the slots,it was funFinal thoughts:This was probally the best all-around all-inclusive we have been to, A great vacation consists of more than just one thing,we really enjoyed all aspects of this vacation,and we would not hestitate to recommend or return.

<Content>A Teens Perspective.. I stayed at the Majestic from Mar.4th -11th, along with my brother(18), mom (46) and dad(44). I, myself am 16 and felt that it would be helpful to hear a review from a teen's perspective. I know when my parents booked the resort I checked Tripadvisor everday for the latest tips and pictures, it was well worth it. I will try to make the review as short, and brief as possible.FLIGHT / BUS-- We flew with skyservice, booking through Sunquest. The flight was excellent, about 4 hours. A full meal was served on the plane which was nice. The customs at Punta Cana airport were well organized and people were off to there resorts very quickly. The downfall was that on the way to our resort the bus broke down. We were told to wait on the side of the road (it was about 11:30 at night, in the midst of no where). Our Sunquest rep. told us another bus would be here to pick us up in 10-15 min., unfortunetly the new bus didn't arrive till 45 minutes later. I felt quite bored on the bus. From previous experiences we have been entertained, and given options to buy drinks. There was no music playing, and the rep. gave us no insight to the town or resort. That's okay though, I was anxious to get to the resort anyways.Grounds-- Astonishing. You always see gardners around picking every little trash off the ground, and weeds out of the garden. Pool-- Refreshing and spacious. If you prefer to relax you should find a chair near the lobbyside of the pool. I personally love to be entertained so I always found a chair down near the Wetbar. Finding a hut and chairs was not a problem. There are about 3-4 bars along the pool, so you never grow thirsty!Food-- The food was good. There is always something to eat and you never go hungry. Fresh crepes every morning, fresh pasta at lunch and fried kabobs at dinner were something to enjoy! The variety was good, I found that Mexico had a bit better variety but nothing to complain about. My dad did get sick from the food on the second last day. He had all the common synptoms, no need to explain. I think it may of been from the pork ribs, thats the only thing he ate that we didn't. Other than that the food was fine. All the al a cartes were wonderful. We never went to the Mexican/Dominican one, its not my fancy. Be sure to book your reservations as soon as your get there, spots fill fast! Be sure to try the Surf and Turf wellington at the Gourmet, The Grilled Garlic Shrimp in the seafood, and of course the Steak! Its amazing. Much better than the buffet.Rooms-- I found the setup to be very different. For familys with teenagers it was not good. My brother and I had our own room. If one of us wanted to have a bath/jacuzzi the other had to leave the room. It was inconvienent at times, but thats okay. The bathroom and shower were also a weird design. I found they were not private at all. After your shower you had to step out into the open, the bathroom is to tiny to change in it, once again he had to leave the room. The bathroom stall was the different. You could see people in it through the frosted glass and could here every little sound. Other than that the rooms were beautiful. Very spacious, though ideal for a couple. The pillows were fine, you can always double the flat ones up. Beds were good. Our converter didn't work, we asked for a new one but it was never delivered. Oh well. There are a few bugs in the rooms. Make sure you check before you go to bed, I suggest putting a towel behind the door at night. We noticed small centipedes would sneak through the crack if we didn't.Entertainment-- The Animation staff was very energetic, always got people going. I enjoyed participating and watching the games and dances. My only suggestion would be to have more teen activities. Many(almost all) were for adults only and the reward was always a bottle of champagne, this is not really useful for a 16 yr. old. Thats okay, my parents of course took it! The theatre was gorgeous. Lots of comfy chairs to relax on. All shows are similar to wherever you go (all inclusive). I enjoyed the Ideal Couple, and Mr. Majestic Shows- they were so hilarious, and enjoyable when they got the audience going.The one thing that we found handy at the resort were the walkways. Althought it only rained once, if it did rain more, no worries. You can make your way all around the resort- staying dry. The main walkway is sheltered from the sky. A couple other things to mention, I don't recommend going to the market. Although you can get some good deals is it really worth it. The sales people really try to convince you to by there stuff. Men would pull you in, and hassle with you. It was intimidating and nerve racking. One other thing, I think the internet prices should be lowered. All resorts I went to offered free internet use. Thats my only real complaint..I'm 16 what do you expect?I have stayed the The Gran Bahia Tulum in the Mayan Riveria, Mexico, El Senador in Cayo Coco, Cuba and Melia Cayo Santa Maria In Cuba. The Majestic was my favourite off all. I say my review is accurate and I think I know from previous experiences. I'd give the Majestic 4.5 stars only because of my dad's sickness.

<Content>Absoultely Perfect, A Peice of Paradise. We stayed at the Majestic from Feb 17-24 and it was by far the best trip I have ever been on. (I have traveled all across Canada and through the United States) Here are some things you should know:The BeachThis was the most beautiful beach I have ever seen, bright aqua coloured water and white sand. The only day we really saw any seaweed was the day they arrived because they cleaned the seaweed off the beach each day. There was always a lounge chair to be found. We also found that the ocean water was warmer than the pool so we spent the majority of our time at the beach. While it is a topless beach if you choose so, most people keep their tops on. If you are interested in fish at all make sure you bring an underwater camera, what you can do is take a roll from the buffet and break it up and put it in an empty bottle of water and go about waist deep in the water and if you put some bread in the water you will see a school of small swordfish. This was very fun.The FoodThe food was excellent at the restaurants, although we found that the buffet got pretty repetitive, but since you only need reservations for two of the restaurants you will have no problem finding variety for dinner. If you like seafood be sure to try the grilled lobster at the seafood restaurant. The sushi bar at the oriental restaurant is also excellent. Just make sure you don't eat too much fruit/drink the fruity drinks because it will make you sick. You probably do not eat that much fruit at home, and then you see all these options of fresh fruit and pretty drinks that look so good you want to try them all, but your body isn't ready to handle that much more fruit per day. Also I found the greasy food bothered me which made it difficult to eat at the buffet but I managed to get through the week absolutely fine, there were still plenty of other places where I could eat. Also I personally found the drinks extremely strong, and did not have a large amount of alcohol while I was there but that is a personal preference. Make sure you try the Majestic Drink, but they are full of fruit so don鈥檛 drink too many.The RoomsThe rooms are gorgeous, we had a garden view on the far end of the resort so we were overlooking a garden next to the service road and the resort next door, some people may not like this because its where they do garbage pickup etc. but we thought it was fantastic because we were worried about noise levels and being woken up in the early morning from reviews we had read but it wasn't a problem because we were on the end of the resort, and did not have any noise problems. The room is kind of an open concept, the only enclosed areas are the toilet and the shower which are surrounded by marble walls and frosted glass doors therefore if someone gets up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, if you are a light sleeper you will probably wake up, but once again not a big deal. We always had fresh towels and a stocked mini fridge, never had a problem with the rooms. Make sure you leave a tip for the maid; it is customary to leave $1 US per person per day. We also left an item per day, make sure though if you are leaving an item to leave a note stating it is for them as well so they can take it home with them.The resort itselfThe resort is huge! It was fully booked while we were there but you would never know there were really that many people there. I have read about some resorts where if you didn't have your towel on a lounge chair by 9am you wouldn't get one for the day, we had no problem with this sometimes not getting to the beach until after lunch. The Entertainment Staff is fantastic, and the shows were always entertaining. Some of them are actually shows where acts that are not from the resort come in and do a show, others are like game shows led by the entertainment staff. These are great things to go see at night. Occasionally due to the humidity the power will cut out, sometimes two or three times an evening however the longest outage we saw was 5 minutes so it wasn鈥檛 a problem just make sure you restart the air conditioner in your room after an outage.ShoppingMake sure you remember to bring all your toiletries with you (such as sunscreen) because it is expensive on the resort (I paid $17 US for a bottle of sunscreen) however most things are very affordable. The shops upstairs in the lobby are more expensive but they are a cigar shop, Harrison鈥檚 Jewellers and a shop that features designer items. Down below there are more shops including a mini mart where you can get things like chips, rum, sunscreen, and souvenirs. There are shops that have carvings, paintings, swimming gear, jewellery etc. If you are planning on going to the market there are two in the area off the resort, one down the beach and one down the road. We went to the one down the beach which our tour operator told us was about 30 minutes away, in reality it took us about 80 minutes to walk there and 80 minutes to walk back so if you plan on doing this the best time is if you have an overcast day so it isn鈥檛 too hot. Make sure you barter well because you can get some really good deals, if the deal is not something you like walk away. Odds are they will chase after you with a better price. There is also a small market set up at the resort on Thursday nights.ExcursionsExcursions are an option for you as well although they are an additional cost, you can do things such as go parasailing; take a tour of the Dominican where you will see a cigar factory, a sugar cane plantation, a Dominican school, a Dominican house etc. Another option is the one we went on at a place called the Marinarium. There you will go swimming on a coral reef, then over to a protected area to swim with Sharks and Stingrays (Nurse sharks, and the Stingrays have their poisonous barb removed) and after that you get back on the boat and they take you to a natural swimming pool in the ocean where the water is about waist deep and warm. This is about a half day long, and cost $78 American. Overall a great experience.The Majestic Colonial was absolutely fantastic, we had no complaints whatsoever, our room was incredibly clean, and we did not see a single bug other than the occasional bee near the plants. Just remember to watch what you eat, put on some sunscreen and you will have a fabulous vacation here!

<Content>Nice, but not as nice as expected I stayed at the Majestic from March 3 - 10. It was my third visit to Punta Cana. It was really nice, I just don't think everything is up to par.Rooms: Really nice for a couple. Doesn't seem ideal for a family. There isn't really any private space to change unless you go in the shower.Food: Ok - the specialty restaurants were pretty good... the buffets weren't the best. They'd run out of things like fruit a lot because they would only put a small amount on a dish were most resorts have trays full of it. The beach buffet was disappointing. They didn't have a big selection at all... They didn't even have pizza! Who doesn't serve pizza at the beach buffet??Beach: Really nice - no seaweed - on the Bavaro beach so of course it's nice.Pool: Nice and big - quiet spots and also spots with entertainment.People: This was really surprising. Part of the reason why i like Punta Cana is because the people are so friendly. The ONLY help that was friendly here was the animation team. Nelson was by far the most friendly and very nice... I was sad to say bye to him. Ray was also really nice and would talk to us a lot and get us to play all those crazy beach games. There is this guy Tyson who was in the gym for most of our stay but we met him at the end - he's very friendly and speaks English very well.The hotel is really nice... I guess I just expected more. I would give it 4 stars tops. The lobby is beautiful, the rooms are nice and as you can see, most people were a lot happier with the resort then I was.

<Content>Incredible Vacation! My fiancee and I stayed at the Majestic from March 4th - 11th. We had a fantastic time. It was my first trip to the Dominican and I loved it, would go back anytime. I'll try to list the things most travellers would want to read about the resort:Room - We stayed in room 2127 which was on the ground floor. The room was beautiful and very clean. We could walk out our back door and jump into the pool. We also had a patio in the back that had an outdoor jacuuzi tub, very nice. The shower was very large and nice. The toilet was seperated in a stall which was a little weird, but it was my fiancee and I so it was ok.Hotel grounds - Very very nice. The pool is incredible. The whole pool is less than 4' deep so we could just walk around the whole thing, which is quite a long walk. There were staff constantly cleaning up garbage so it was very clean.Beach - Also very nice. We only went to the beach one day because the pool at the hotel was so nice. Staff - Excellent. Most of the staff spoke english fairly well and they really liked when you spoke or tried to speak spanish to them. They were all very friendly and helpful for the most part.Food - The breakfast buffet was very good. There were always lots of choices and the omlette station was great. We didn't eat lunch for the most part but I heard the lunch buffet was very similar to the dinner buffet. I can't say the buffet food was fantastic, but for an all inclusive resort I think it was pretty good. We ate at Le Gourmet one night. We weren't all that impressed, didn't go back. The Japanese restaurant was by far the best meal we had there, but it is hard to get reservations so make sure when you get to the resort you book right away. The steakhouse was also a great place to have dinner, it's close to the beach so there's a nice breeze and the steak was very good.Weather - Couldn't have been any better. It was sunny and about 30 everyday. It rained a couple of times at night but not for very long.We truly enjoyed our stay at the Majestic. In fact we're planning on going back next year to get married. If you're expecting to go on vacation and eat food like you do at home and you don't want to see the occassional topless woman and you can't handle people smoking then I would suggest you stay home, as the rest of the world isn't like Canada, but if you don't mind these things then I highly recommend the Majestic. Thanks for making our trip even better Charlie and Lisa!

<Content>Great choice for a family with small kids we just came back from a week vacation at this hotel which was great for us and our 2 children (4  2) years old. We liked everything about the hotel especially the kids club, we had the choice of dropping them off every morning from 9 till 6 in the evening. they take good care of the children, magie used to prepare them for the small pool available there and by lunch time she takes all the chilren to the beach restaurant as they would be really hungry, she serves them the food they like and takes them back to the kids club for some other activities there. Everything else in the hotel was good especially the service, people there were very simple, like to serve you all the time.

<Content>Great Time at the Majestic Colonial My wife and I went to the Majestic with our 9 year old son during school vacation week. It was our first time to the DR, and first time that we stayed at an all-inclusive resort. At first, I was a little overwhelmed by the size of the resort (600 rooms and totally full that week). But things settled down pretty quickly, and within a couple of days, we were relaxed and into the pace of the vacation. For me, two things helped immensely. One was getting out and playing golf on the new Nick Price designed golf course that is 5 minutes from the resort (they pick you up in a golf cart). I had brought my own clubs and ended up playing 3 rounds there. Excellent course, quick but true greens, and very well manicured. Wonderful staff at the course also. The second key to getting into the pace of the vacation was the very welcoming crowd and staff at the main bar in the hotel. I met many charming couples--a number of Canadians in fact--while drinking a few nightly Presidente's at the bar. The experience was enhanced by a terrific bartender--Juan Carbrera--who quickly adopted me as a favored customer, nicknaming me David Ortiz since I come from Boston, despite the fact that I am 50 years old, white, and weigh about half the amount of our favorite Red Sox slugger.Juan not only befriended me and my wife, but also many other patrons of the bar. He speaks five languages, including Spanish (of course), English, French, German, and if you can believe it, even a limited amount of Chinese. He is really a star performer back there, and creates a fun and festive atmospere.The other bartenders and staff were also terrific, as was the staff at the various restaurants, stores and front desk.Despite my fears from reading reviews on TripAdvisor prior to going on the trip, the food at the Majestic was quite acceptable. Good variety and a lot of restaurant choices.The room was great and the overall experience at the hotel was also very good. Fantastic pool that spans the entire distance from the main lobby all the way down to the beach. Our son had a great time navigating the pool on an inflatable raft that we purchased at the resort. We also went on the Swimming with Dolphins excursion that turned out to be alot of fun. Having your wife and son kissed by a friendly dolphin is a surprising and unforgettable image.Overall, I would rate the resort and the vacation itself very highly, and we will definitely consider a return trip.

<Content>Fantastic Holiday Our stay at the Majectic Colonial was amazing. My husband and our three girls ages 21, 16, and 13 along with 9 other friends all stayed at the end of February. The food selection was amazing and the service was outstanding. We didn't have to wait for anything. We all have different taste and the resort had something for everyone from pasta for the younger kids to chateaubriand for the adults. The animation team of Sandy and Rey was also outstanding. Their friendliness towards the adults and kids was always welcoming and enjoyable. From the games we played to the exercises to the Spanish lesson to just the friendly conversation was outstanding. They always managed to start and end our day with a smile. The accommodations and housekeeping were great and as well the overall size of the hotel and the proximiately to the beach are great. We went snorkling, scuba diving, golfing and deep sea fishing as well as long walks along the beach. We always felt very safe at this resort. The wet bar and the bartendars were always friendly and understood our needs and accommodated us completely. The kids loved ordering daquaries at the bar and we never worried about alcohol with them. The pool was very clean and georgeous, it probably took us an hour to walk the whole length of the pool. Honestly this is probably the best family resort vacation we have had.

<Content>complainers are crazy! If you want a short review here it is...absolute perfection, a dream vacation, and we not only highly reccommed it but would go back ourselves. For more details, see below.Okay...if you want a resort where everyone speaks English, where the food is always hot and always cold, where the grounds are impeccable and the shows (though they will cost you $175 usd) are fabulous, where the European custom of sunbathing topless is not allowed...I strongly suggest the Wynn Hotel or other 5 star in Las Vegas! And please, if that is what you want, stay away from the Majestic, because those of us who appreciate the fact this is a thrid world country, who like to challenge ourselves with learning the language when we travel, and who are there for a good time really don't want the complainers around!!!The Majestic was gorgeous! We were there from Marhc 2-9 and loved the culture, the climate, the pools, the ocean, you name it! The only annoyance was truly those visitors who expected to be treated like kings and queens, who loudly fussed about everything, and who marched around like they were entitled to some mysterious ideal. The resort itself was a dream!The food was good, better than I have had at other all inclusives. Yes things get warm...but since much of the hotel is open air, you rol with it. You are in the Caribbean for heaven's sake!! What do people expect!As for getting sick, don't worry about it. Here are my simple steps to preventing illness when on vacation. Don't drink the tap water, or even brush you teeth, but that isn't a problem because there is bottled water everywhere. Don't eat and drink to excess every minute...your body isn't used to that much rich food, and free flowing alcohol. Don't drink too many of the frozen slushy drinks...they have coconut milk which is a natural laxative. And for heaven's sake wear a hat and some sunscreen. People were purple they were so badly burned, and sun stroke will make you sicker than anything. I am extremely fair skinned, and I managed to stay totally unbruned the whole time. And if you are really concerned, look into Grapefruit Seed Extract...a natural remedy that there is loads of info on the internet about and widely available at health stores...perfect for travel.The hotel was at capacity and we found chairs in the shade every single day, and were never out of our room before 10. Yes lots of people save them...so what! Somedays we did have to move a chair that was in the sun into the shade - big deal! The bathroom were fine, but maybe my husband and I are more comfortable with each other than some people. I expected a real shocker considering some reviews, and it just wasn't the case!Consider upgrading to a Junior Colonial Suite...that was what we booked and we had a lovely private deck with hot tub we filled and soaked in and watched the moon. And the shows wree not high class but fun and certainly worth it!Seriously, if you can't handle breaking out of your comfort zone a bit, I don't think you should go to any third world country...let alone Dominican! But for the rest of you who want a safe, lovely holiday...don't miss the Majestic!

<Author>QuebecFrank
<Content>Simply the best First, let me say that we are picky people... So picky, we had to try a Sandals last year to finally get satisfaction from a all inclusive resort.I really can't find anything worth complaining about this hotel. The Grounds are beautiful, the rooms are lovely, the beach is fabulous, the pool is amazing, people are friendly and will do everything they can to make you happy. The food is great everywhere. I didn't really enjoy most of the deserts (I mostly ate passion fruit as desert), though the fried icecream was very nice... The first thing we look at when booking a resort, is the food. Quantity of a la carte restaurants, and food reviews are our #1 concern. If this is the same to you, then this resort is just the place you have to go.BREAKFAST : You had 3 choices hereThe main buffet had EVERYTHING, and I really mean everything... omelettes, pancakes, crepes, french toasts, saussages, ham, bacon, toasts, cheeses, yogourt, fruits, champaign, fresh juices, coffee (that's not even half of it...)the Square Bar : Had fresh coffee, freshly made orange juices and croissants.The Beach Grill and restaurant served Continental Breakfast.LUNCH : 2 choices here (in form of buffet)The main buffet was really the best choice here in terms of food quality, and choice, but some people complained beacause they wouldn't let you in with your bathing suit on. Women could go in if they had a lite dress over their bikini (given they were dry). Men couldn't go in speedo (which is good if you ask me), they had to be dry bermudas with dry t-shirt. There you had plenty of choices again : all kinds of salads, pasta stations, Pizza, Fajitas, nachos, Chicken, Ham, Steak, saussages, soups, Paella, potatoes, some seafood (but not much I have to agree) The beach Buffet had seafood salads, tomato salads, soups, French Fries, Hamburgers, HotDogs, Paella, pasta stations, fried seafood etc... We ate there often, but only because it was right on the beach, and we didn't have to change ... just put a t-shirt on, and eat (don't get me wrong, the food was great, but not as great, and not as many choices as the main buffet) . Service here was amazing, I never saw the bottom of my glass... DINNER (the best part)We never went to the buffet for dinner. There are 6 a la carte restaurant (4 which don't need any reservations). The first night, we ate at the Gourmet restaurant (reservations needed) which was excellent, but we found it came 6th.2nd night we ate at the chineses restaurant (same restaurant than the japanese, but 2 different menus, and Japanese needs reservation) The food was fantastic. Wonton soup, egg rolls, chow main, sweet and sour pork, Everything you'd expect from a chinese restaurant, and everything was great... THEY EVEN HAVE A SUSHI BAR. The sushis were not the best we've ever had, but they were still very good (except for the cooked tuna ones...)3rd nigth was SeaFood. Shrimps and Lobster (they would bring you more, and more until you told them to stop). Simply Fantastic (my personal favorite)4th night was caribean. Again, we all loved this one. Lots of local stuff, everything was good.5th night was Japanese. If you've ever gone to a japanese restaurant where they cook the food right in front of you on the Teppan-Yakis, well that was it. The cook is not particularly spectacular, but the food is amazing...6th night, we went again to the chinese restaurant because it was my wifes favorite.7th night we went to the SteakHouse. We all took the EntreCote, and all loved it. We also ordered Bearnaise sauce which was just fabulous.As I said, Food is really a priority for us, so that's why I took so much of my review to talk about it... but there are so many things great about this hotel, I really can't see why anybody wouldn't like it.All other positive aspects : Friendly staffLots of bars, with quality drinksHuge pool.Spectacular grounds.Fantastic Beach.Front Desk very helpful, Our friends asked for a room change, and they got it right away. They also spoke Spanish, English as well as French.The guards at the beach send away unwanted sellers.Some negative : The sea in front of the hotel is rocky, but there is a wide sandy spot about 300 feet wide by 200 feet long (identified with boeys...), the rest is not really nice for swimming, (but great for snorkeling)The architecture of the site is amazing, but the construction quality leaves a lot to be desired... Certainly not canadian construction standards...The hotel has their own trip sellers, and they can be quite insisting the couple first days, but When they understand you're not interested, they leave you alone. ( I heard this is quite normal in PC )That's it for the negative... everything else is perfect.Hope this review helps. Excuse my English (I'm a French Canadian)

<Content>The Best Vacation Ever!!!!!!!!!!! It's been a week since we returned from our vacation and i still havent gotten over being back in cold NYC.The hotel was fantastic ......lush grounds staffed but what i can only describe as the friendly people on earth (sorry disneyland)Everyone greets you with a warm genuine smile and makes it his/hers mission to make your vacation outstanding.The rooms are lush and the terrace ( if tou re on the 2nd or 3rd levels) looks out over the pool which runs the full length of the hotel.The beach is clean and the waves inviting.Dont be put off by weather reports that say cloudy It seem the DR version of cloudy is 3 clouds off in the corner of a bright blue sky.Please take me back w/you hahahahahMark J WeinbergBrooklyn New york

<Content>Majestic Colonial is Awesome! Stayed at the Majestic March 1st -6th. We were impressed with the hotel from the moment we stepped off of the bus. Before we could even make it to the check in counter, our bags were taken care of and we had frozen drinks in hand.Our room was available upon check-in, we stayed in 2351 (Ocean Front). Room was absolutely beautiful and the view was breath-taking. We spent a number of nights on the terrace enjoying a drink and the sounds of the ocean. Jacuzzi on the terrace is awesome, however, takes a good 20 minutes to fill (well worth it once you get it going!)House-keeping was great and had no negative expereinces. Mini bar was refilled daily with water, beer,and snacks.Pool and beach are awesome, we typicaly arrived at the pool between 8:30-10:00AM and always found chairs available. The entertainment team is great! I found all of them to be very personable and professional. Most of the team spoke 2-3 different languages. Our favorite was Paublo who took the time to introduce himself not to mention he is a great Spanish instructor!The Spa was very good and reasonably priced, we enjoyed a 55 minute couples massage. I found the massage to be equally as good as one might experience at a Spa in their hometown.We found the food to be average / good with many choices to select from (Breakfast  Dinner meals we enjoyed the best). The beef  pork taste very different than here in North America (although some enjoyed it). Service was always excellent, our glasses were never allowed to go empty and we were always greeted with a smile.The shows in the evening (especially the Michael Jackson Show) were very enjoyable, followed by time at the disco with the entertainment team. The casino is small but enjoyable.Outside of the hotel resort grounds there is a small shopping plaza. I DO NOT recommend shopping there. Extremely high pressure, none of the items are marked with pricing, and you are usually quoted prices much higher than the items are worth. We always offered 70-80% less than what they quoted and they always took the offer. All the items at the shopping plaza are also offered within the hotel resort, properly priced and marked accordingly with no pressure.Overall we found the Majestic Colonial to be a great resort and a good value for an all inclusive. You won't be disappointed at the Majestic!If you have any quesions feel free to send me a note and I'd be more than happy to try and answer your questions...Ray

<Content>3 star hotel This hotel was actually rated as a 5 star hotel which is why we booked this establishment. We have stayed at 5 star hotels, this is why were were disappointed. First the positives. The hotel grounds and our room were beautiful..As were the pool and beaches. The tennis pro Julio and Dominico the Sax player also first rate. Wonderful massages at the beachThe negativesThe food was average to good. The fact that we were unabe to make reservations for the Japanese or Le Gourmet Resteraunts until the end if our stay was totaly unacceptable. We were actually able to gain entry to these restaurterants much earlier by talking to some of the other guests who informed us of little tricks such as walking in to the chinese section of the restaurant and gaining access to the japanese section and I found it quite interesting that Le Gourmet was half empty at all times, but you could still tip the male host to get a table. The seafood restaurant was ok, mexican restaurant terrible unless you like goat-japanese-good, steakhouse-good, le gourmet-average-good. I am not a fan of buffets which unfortunately is every breakfast and lunch. They don not understand what oatmeal is, even though they have a pot of it the consistency is water. Decent omlets. Food aways cold. Got sick on tuna pasta salad.Considering the fact that the facility is only a year old we found that the tennis courts were peeling and that the equipment in gym were plastic-really made for home use!!!!Hotel did not have a printer available for use-unable to print airline tickets. Had to pay for computer time. Hotel refuses to exchange money for american dollars-total inconvenience.Topless bathers, men fondeling women on the beach, topless women in the baby pool clearly in view of children.!!!! Women changing bathing suits on the beach in clear view of every one!!! The smoking was intolerable. People eating, smoking and coughing at the tables.(outside restaurants)The nightly entertainment was a joke., including the Michael Jackson Show which everybody seams to brag about. I would give this a 3 star rating at best We will not return to this hotel

<Content>Beutiful Place, Lackluster Service My husband I went the week before Christmas. The grounds and room are truly spectacular. The beach is absolutely beautiful. I would rate the facilities an absolute FIVE. The service and food however were very much below our expectations. We had several issues during our stay. First, we wanted a room change because our guaranteed ocean view room was on the main level and directly in front of the activities hut. So we saw more grass hut than ocean. Our new room was awesome, but it took several calls and several hours to get a bellman to move our bags to the new room.The food was average at best. We weren't able to get a reservation to the Japanese restaurant, which was disappointing. I enjoyed the Mexican restaurant the most. Overall, the food was either too salty, or just plan bland. By our 5th day, all of the food pretty much tasted the same. After doing all kinds of research, and even calling the hotel ahead of time, we were assured that we fell within the time frame to receive room service. However, once we arrived, it was made very clear to us, that room service was NOT included in our package. Very disappointing, as we would have liked to enjoy at least one breakfast in bed. I would say that our check-in process was relatively easy, but found the check-out process very cumbersome. We were in the farthest building and had to lug our bags on our own for fear that our bags would not make it before our scheduled departure. Overall, the resort grounds and rooms are worth a trip, if you find a good bargain. I personally don't believe this resort is capable of offering a true 5 star service any time soon.

<Content>Fairly Nice for an All-Inclusive - 3 Star Quality HOTEL REVIEW: 3.5My wife and I stayed at the Majestic in September of 2006 The Majestic is a nice all-inclusive resort that has a more intimate feel to it compared to the other resorts in Punta Cana. The place is pretty new and the vegetation around the grounds shows it. Also the service is hit or miss. Overall pretty good for the price and I can't complain since it was $144 / night for both of us. Not that I expect 5 star quality at that price, I also don't expect them to advertise themselves as a 5 star resort.Food was ok for being an all-inclusive but probably same quality as the rest of the all-inclusives in the area. It was nice to have a wide variety of foods (mexican, domincan, tempenyaki (more chinese flavored than japanese, french, steakhouse, seafood, and italian.)Overall we had a nice time and enjoyed ourselves, if you are set on going to Punta Cana, this is a good choice for the value. DESTINATION REVIEW: 3Punta Cana as a destination is great if all you like to do is sit by the beach and pool all day for 7 days, the pools are very nice and the beaches are great! However, if you like doing other stuff like taking excursions, or going to the downtown for dinner or shopping, there are much better destinations. When going on an excursion for example, it takes at least an hour or two to get to the where the activites are since the shuttle buses need to pick up people from 10 different resorts before driving 30-40 minutes to the activity.Also, there isn't a nice downtown area. The only shopping you'll find are little artesan shops, which are ok but once you see one, you've seen them all.We probably won't go back to Punta Cana for these reasons.CIGARS 1.5:Don't expect to get a good deal down there. In fact its cheaper to buy them from a reputable dealer on the web then to get them down there. Plus, in most shops they sell very low quality cigars, unless you know what you are doing don't stray from the classics and brand names.STAY AWAY FROM DON CARLOS CIGAR FACTORY. They picked up up from the hotel (they advertise free transportation to-from), when we got there they told us they'd give us a great deal and a discount on their cigars. However, at the cash register he did not offer any discount and additionally he charged me an additional 3% for a credit card transaction! I politely told him that I prefer not to make any purchases and that we'd like transporation back to our hotel. They had us waiting for over 1.5 hours!! We would have left earlier on our own accord but they kept promising that the car was on its way. Finally I called a cab. These guys were creeps and not very customer service oriented.Note: My rating reflects the Quality of the Hotel and is not influenced by my overal experience in Punta Cana. I hate it when people post a review complaining about things that are outside of the responsibility of the hotel.

<Content>Great - once we got our room! We went to the Majestic Colonial for the February vacation week. It must have been a bad omen hearing a story on the flight from a gentleman who was booted from a different resort last year due to overbooking. Well, that is what happened to us upon arrival, thankfully for just one night, however. We arrived at 6 pm, hungry and tired with 3 children in tow only to learn they had overbooked and could not accomodate us till the following day. They transported us and several other parties to a nearby (45 min!) larger resort although it was like going from the Hyatt to the Best Western. Not what we paid for. We later learned that it was the internet type bookies like us (we used Expedia) who got booted, not the clients from the large tour operators like Apple, Funjet vacations, etc...So, just a note of caution when booking a trip on your own, you are low on the totem pole. All the confirmation papers and yelling did nothing, they simply did not have the rooms!Now about the resort: we've done many all-inclusives and I would say the rooms are by far the nicest and most spacious. No bugs, no odors, perfect AC. Food was above average for an all-inclusive but don't expect gourmet. Beach was spectacular, plenty of chairs to go around. Of course the palapas go first, although not at 6:00 am, but by 8:30 am, so a little more humane.The week we were there there were a ton of families with small children, and couples in their 20's, 30's or retirees. We have teenagers, didn't see too many families like ours, there were some but that was fine. You never know, each week can be different. Pool is huge, clean, again plenty of chairs. I would say we were in the minority as Americans, many Europeans and French Canadians, a ton of smoking so thank goodness everything is open-air, and expect topless sunbathing.The staff is all very friendly, I would say the activities staff could have done a better job of engaging the guests, particularily the kids, of that I've seen better, particularily at Club Med. All in all, though, it was a wonderfully relaxing time in an excellent resort of this type.

<Content>Majestic was great Booked the Majestic for our honeymoon. Pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the resort was. + points for Great food, good variety, and atmosphere to dine in, Pool was vast and clean, lots of chairs to select from provided you got to the pool or the beach by 9:00am, drinks were generous portions and not watered down, water when requested, you got a bottle of it and not a glass, Beach was clean most days but disappoined with the brown sand (we had stayed at the Punta Cana Princess a few years ago and the white sand at Bavaro is amazing) apparently Majestic is not on Bavaro beach., Jazz band and dancing under the stars is wonderful. - points for entertainment. The theater is excellent, but the show quality is poor. In one week we saw only one show that featured colorful costumes and dance numbers even though it was not properly synchronized or choreographed, it was better that the other days, when they had only interactive shows. the Michael Jackson show is over rated and did not impress me much, the magic and circus show was something unusual and entertaining, but geared towards children.Other than that...highly recommend it..would go back there again.

<Content>5 Star? After reading many positive reviews, my family (my husband ,our 2 sons...ages 12 and 16 and I) decided to stay at the Majestic. The airport in Punta Cana was very quaint and got us in the caribbean mood immediately. The transfer was fairly quick, with only a couple of stops along the way. CHECK-IN We were immediately greeted with a cold refreshing drink, which was very much appreciated. We were told our room wouldn't be ready for a couple of hours but they provided us with a room to change, so we could enjoy the resort in the meantime. When we went back to get our room, the check-in was a bit of a zoo. We originally had a room on the top floor, but was moved to a ground floor room once we explained that I suffer back problems.ROOMS For a couple, the rooms would be great but there wasn't alot of privacy for a family of 4. I still can't understand why they would build the toilot as a stall. They were extreamly small, with very little privacy. The beds were extreamly hard (but that seems the norm at all inclusive resorts) and the pillows were very, very flat. Housekeeping was very quick to accommidate our request for extra pillows, as well as other things like face cloths. Housekeeping kept the room fairly clean but dust was visably seen in some areas.FOOD The first thing 3 of us ate once we arrived, was a hamburger at the buffet near the beach. It wasn't till we were halfway done, did we realize that the hamburger wasn't fully cooked. Needless to say, we didn't eat the rest of it. That night, my 12 year old got sick, followed by me the next day, then my husband. Thankgoodness we brought Immodium!! Unfortunately, I ended up having to see the doctor at the resort and after 36 hours and 2 IV treatments, I was feeling better. From then on, we were very cautious about the food. In regards to the buffet, we are not picky eaters but we were hard pressed to find something to our liking. The kids ended up eating pizza all week and my husband and I stuck with the pasta. The japanese cooking demonstration fun and entertaining, the caribbean was just ok but the steakhouse was great. I would of been nice if the breakfest buffet was open a little later, as we always seemed to miss out on breakfest. There is a contenental breakfest in the restaurant by the beach, but it is extreamly limited. The snack bar is only open from 11pm till the wee hours of the morning and is tucked away behind the shops (by the kid's section). With 2 growing boys, it would of been advantagous to have a snackbar near the beach and open all afternoon.POOL  BEACH The pool is very unique and large enough to accommadate those that want to play and those that want to relax. In the early afternoon, lounges were always available, but as the day wore on, it seemed harder to find a group of four togeather. A waitress was always available to take your drink orders and deliver them to your lounge....a very nice touch. It is a shame that some vacationers toss their empty cups in the bushes, when there are garbage bins close by. The entertainment staff at the pool were always full of energy. They always managed to get participants to join in and rewarded the winners with a bottle of spirits. Unfortunately, when the kids were victorious, they didn't make provisions to reward their efforts. The beach was beautiful and usually there was a welcomed breeze coming off the ocean. Most people spent the early afternoon at the beach so a lounge by the water was difficult to find. The beach was always maintained and tidied up each night. The water was a little on the rough side, but it only added to the fun. Taking a insulated cup to the beach is a great idea as there are no bars directly on the beach. Other guests were telling us that the prices of water activities would change depending on how busy they were. For example, if the parasailing was slow, the price would be cheaper than those times where it was busy.BARS The bars were always busy and at times it took awhile to looked after. We found this especially true in the evening, where the only bars open were in the lobby. Waiting 20 minutes to be served was not out of the norm.ENTERTAINMENT The evening entertainment in the theatre didn't start till 10pm, which seemed a little late. Every other night, the entertainment consisted of audience participation and got to be boring mid week. The magician show was great, as was the Micheal Jackson show. As the resort matures, I'm sure their entertainment will grow. The sax player was awesome...especially when he played down by the beach. He always encouraged people to get up and dance but those that wanted to sit back and listened were always welcomed.MEDICAL There is a doctor on the premise 24 hours/7 days a week. She was very nice and kept a tight eye on you if you needed her services. MONEY There is an ATM machine in the lobby but it was out of money for a few days during our stay. Apparently, this is the only source for cash at the resort. It despenses passos only, so becareful not to withdraw more than you need. Even though we had a few rough days, we still enjoyed our holiday. We wouldn't say this was a 5 star resort, but it is definately a solid 4 star (regardless of the food incident). If we travel to Punta Cana again, we will definately try a different resort.*make sure you have $20/person set aside for departure taxes. The airport requires it in US$ or passos and will only accept cash.

<Content>Amazing!!!! My husband and I travelled to the Majestic with 5 friends from January 20th-27th and had an amazing time! Neither my husband and I have been to an all inclusive before but all of our friends have been away many times and warned us that we had picked one of the best resorts they had ever been to. Everything about this hotel was amazing! I can hardly believe we have been home for a month and I am just writing about our amazing time now.First and foremost we want to thank all of the staff at the Majestic who made our time there amazing. Eduardo was our coffee guy in the buffet restaurant and every day we made sure we sat in his area. The chefs for the omelettes and crepes not only made the best breakfast food but they always greeted you with a smile.Franklin was one of the restaurant managers and he entertained us in the Chinese and Japanese restaurant. My husband Robbie loved him!!!Now for the entertainment staff...we did activities with them every single day at the pool and had an absolute blast. I especially want to thank Sandy...you are the best!!! and I also want to thank Jesus, Pablo and the rest of the entertainment team.The Pool Bar staff are incredible and we ordered our Bianca Specials daily from our waitress Bianca and when she was on holidays Ishmael (sorry if I spelled your name wrong)All the staff are amazing and they try their hardest to make your vacation amazing.Rooms: Our room was on the main floor facing out to the pool and it had a jacuzzi on the balcony. The rooms were beautiful and very clean. Our bar fridge was fully stocked every day. We had lots of towel art in our room and left gifts for our cleaning lady to take to her family. She was great. We had lots of pillows so even though they were a little flat they were still comfy. We slept great in the beds. Our favourite part was the shower which was huge...had great pressure and hot water. The jaccuzi tubs inside and out were also great.Food: Breakfast was one of my favourite meals of the day. The omelettes and the crepes were delicious. As for the complaints on the food being cold it wasn't an issue for us as there was lots of other choices. They would even cook fresh eggs for you and if you didn't want an omelette they would scramble them! Fresh fruit was plentiful. The restaurants were very good with our favourites being the steakhouse, Chinese (no reservation needed) and Japanese (this is a must do!!!)Pool: Was huge and had tons of chairs. The resort was at capacity while we were there and we never had to go early to reserve chairs. We went down at about 10am every day and got chairs at the pool bar with no problem. We liked it here because of all the entertainment but if you are looking for something a little quieter the pool is so long that you will not have a problem.Beach: Although we didn't spend much time here because we loved the pool so much the beach was very nice and again tons of chairs and palapas for shade. You can go there at any time of the day and find chairs.Entertainment: The shows were really good and entertaining. The disco was fun although it got really smoky in there so we tended to go there later at night when it slowed down and the lobby bar closed. The saxophone player was great and played a good assortment of music.All in all this was a great place to spend a week of holidays and I would recommend it to anyone.Thanks also to all of the amazing friends we met!!!!

<Content>Very Nice w/ a few drawbacks My husband and I stayed for 5 nites at the Majestic Colonial. We were greeted warmly and given a welcome drink while checking in. The rooms are lovely. We stayed on the ground floor facing the pool (we had actually requested a garden view, but as it turned out, the pool closes at 6pm so my worries about listening to the sounds of children screaming were unfounded).The staff is, for the most part warm and welcoming. The property itself is gorgeous. A spacious lobby and plenty of seating. A few tips for the traveler:If you wish to get a pool or beach chair, you must arrive early and simply place a towel, or even a token item, such as a comb, a t-shirt etc.) on the chair and, unfair as it seemed to me, the chairs are yours for the day. You can go have breakfast, nap for 2 more hours, and Voila, you chair remains vacant. I told my husband that I felt creepy doing this, but the first day, we could not find a place on the beach, and it infuriated me that for hours, chairs were available, but I could not sit in them.The are only 2 restaurants that require reservations. We were lucky enough to get a reservation at both the japanese and the french restaurant. The japanese experience was really great. You sit a table w/ 8 people and watch as the chef prepares the meal. It is just like the Kanki Japanese steak house here in Raleigh, NC. On the other hand, we felt that the french restarant was a complete waste of time. The service was unfriendly and the food was almost inedible. You had to pay extra for anything other than the house wine, which was pretty bad, but drinkable (my advice, order the white house wine)Other than a few other things that bothered us (we had stayed at the Paridisius Punta Cana last year and there were a few details that were better at that property) I would still choose the Majestic.

<Content>First AI, loved it, will definitely be returning We just returned from a week at the Majestic Colonial. This was our first all inclusive (AI) experience, and while we don't have other DR hotels to compare against, I'll simply state my opinions based on our experience.Rooms - We booked the standard room and it was very nice. Next time I would consider the poolside room just so we could get our chairs into the sun without having to reserve them in the morning with everyone else. The room sizes are plenty large, and well maintained.Service - Excellent, everyone was friendly and went out of their way to please you. Those more comfortable with English tended to be more outgoing, also the Animation team (entertainment group) tried to get you involved whenever they were near (but never annoying). However just using some Spanish phrases and smiling a lot usually got warm smiles in return and an eventual understanding. It really made for a more special experience. Additionally, rooms were cleaned well, bar fridge was stocked daily and with extras if requested. One more point, Majestic Mike, who frequents the forum quite often, was very helpful on a number of occasions.Value - The cost for the Majestic was comparable to the other resorts. The grounds were beautiful, the beach was easily accessible, rooms were great, amenities were good.Food - Reservations are needed for Teppenyaki (Japanese) and Le Gourmet restaurants. These are absolutely worth it, and book your meals immediately after checking in as reservations can be tough to get. The main buffet restaurants had a good selection of food, including fresh pastas at lunch and omlettes in the morning. We also loved the banana smoothies and champagne orange juice at breakfast. Another favourite for us was the Rodeo steak restaurant for dinner. Try the brochette and chateaubriand.Bars - Plentiful and with an excellent selection of drinks. The Majestic, which is basically a frozen creamsicle mix, is excellent with dark rum, and wound up being the drink of choice for the week (and was for a lot of people). Remember though to drink lots of water if you're going to be out in the sun.Entertainment - Movies for the kids are available in the evening, and the nightly entertainment was varied. Do not miss the Michael Jackson and Circus Dream shows, they were by far the best of the week. The animation team also had lots of daytime activities down by the wet bar/beach area. There was also a great saxophone and keyboard duo near the lobby playing almost every night, an excellent deviation between dinner and the nightly shows or simply as a stand alone event.Pool - One of the signature points of the Majestic, the pool stretches from almost the main lobby area to just before the beach. Great for a dip when the heat got to be too much.Beach - The views were fantastic, the sand soft and clean. I saw workers cleaning the sand of as much garbage as possible.Casino - We only went on one evening; it's fairly small but we enjoyed ourselves.Sports Bar/Disco - Though we didn't go, we heard good things from people we spoke with.Spa - My wife had a massage and found it quite good and comparable to those she receives from a licensed massage therapist here. The facility was beautiful and most inviting.Golf - Punta Blanca is immediately next door and is still developing. The price was very reasonable; $105 secured a cart, greens fee, lunch, unlimited course drinks, and range balls. Additionally, a cart came to pick you up and drop you off. Club rentals at $40 are quite reasonable for a resort (I played with newer Callaway Big Berthas). The course was good, though the waste bunkers still need some work. Also, there are no ocean view holes despite the general proximity to the sea. A good value nonetheless.Side Trips - Tour operators provide their own enhanced excursions, but with some ingenuity I was able to procure a day trip with Tropical Storm, a catamaran tour which took us to a shipwreck, provided snorkel gear to see tropical fish and coral as well as stingrays and sharks, stopped at a resort for some fun on a three story slide, and finally took us to a private lagoon for drinks and a great lunch. Also I was picked up from the hotel for a short trip to Don Lucas Cigars, where you can not only purchase cigars, rum, coffee, art and clothing, but you also see the cigar making process (you can even roll one yourself). The shops outside the hotel are interesting, but make sure you negotiate well. Handmade items starting at $30 can easily be negotiated down to below $10. Finally the Majestic shops can be pricey, but the quality of the items are fairly much assured. Any forgotten items (suntan lotion, etc.) are easily attained, but at a significantly higher price ($15-$20), but the clothing is reasonable as are the trinkets and artwork.My overall impression of the Majestic is that it's an excellent resort that doesn't try to cater to every possible traveller, is still developing but does a lot very well for such a young resort, has excellent staff, has beautiful views, great rooms and amenities, and good food and drink. I would highly recommend the Majestic to anyone.

<Content>Don't come here for the food!!!!!!!!!! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Majestic from February 9th to February 16th. The best way to describe this hotel is 鈥渃lose, but no cigar鈥? At a glance, everything about the resort looks amazing. However, if you take a closer look, you鈥檒l find that this place has many flaws. I can deal with most of the flaws. The food was by far the worst thing about this resort, followed by the not so private bathrooms, and the fact that they reserved the wrong room for us. The FoodBefore choosing this resort, we read all the reviews relating to the food choices and found that the reviews were mixed. We got the impression that the negative reviews were a result a few snobby people who expected way too much from an all-inclusive resort. On the other hand, we got the impression that the super positive reviews were the result of a few people who still consider spaghetti and pizza a foreign food. We figured that the food was probably of average quality (at least the buffet food)鈥bout on par with or just below the quality of food you would find at restaurants such as Friday鈥檚, Bennigan鈥檚, Ruby Tuesday, and others just like it鈥othing spectacular, but decent. We expected the specialty restaurants to be slightly better. We figured that a five star hotel should at least be able meet these food requirements鈥ot too much to ask鈥ight?鈥rong!!! Now I don鈥檛 consider myself a food connoisseur, but I know bad food when I taste it. Most of the food here is terrible, has no flavor鈥ust completely bland and boring. So, unfortunately, I have to side with the few snobby people鈥 guess that makes me a food snob. If food is important to you, then I would not recommend this place for you. However, I鈥檓 sure some of you probably already made your reservations or think my review is flawed. If that鈥檚 that case, then read my reviews below of each restaurant as a guide while at the resort鈥iterally, print this review and take it with you鈥ou鈥檒l thank me. As a quick tip, the best food at the resort is at the Dominican food at the Mexican restaurant鈥o figure鈥he Dominican鈥檚 know how to make Dominican food.Breakfast-There is only one place to eat breakfast, which is at the main buffet building. Not to worry though鈥he breakfast is very good and always fresh. The omelet stations (more than one) can prepare eggs of any style. Almost every breakfast item you can think of is available such as pancakes, french toast, waffles, crapes, sausage, bacon, pastries, awesome fruity milkshakes, an assortment of breads, and much much more. The breakfast seems to accommodate all the major nationalities that attend this resort. (FYI鈥he Dominican coffee they serve is not high quality Dominican Coffee鈥ou have to leave the resort to find good coffee鈥ut I like the coffee from McDonalds better than Starbucks, so what do I know).Lunch-You have two options at lunch鈥ross and disgusting. Lunch is served at the main buffet building and at the restaurant near the beach called La Hispaniola. The lunch at the main buffet serves basically the same thing every day鈥lmost all of it is gross鈥ood enough for a dog. However, sometimes they do serve Dominican food, which is very good鈥ut it鈥檚 hard to find because they don鈥檛 label it as Dominican food. As for La Hispaniola, don鈥檛 be confused by the name鈥his place does not serve any latin food. They serve hamburgers on hard buns, hotdogs, and french fries. On the plus side, both restaurants do have very good desserts. Dinner- For dinner you have eight options鈥? most are disgusting (Option 8 is the best). Option 1 (The Main Buffet) 鈥?You guessed it鈥ross. It was the same thing every night. We did not go back. Options 2 and 3 (The Rodeo Grill Steakhouse and Tres Carabelas) - Both are located at the La Hispaniola location, which is split into the two restaurants for dinner. At the steakhouse, I go the steak, which was about on par with a steak that you would find at a breakfast diner like IHOP. I ordered my steak as medium rare鈥鈥檓 glad to report that it did not get me sick. My girlfriend ordered the pork chops鈥hey were dry, tough and tasteless. We did not go back. Tres Carabelas is a Seafood restaurant. I got the lobster and she got the shrimp. Both portions were very small鈥owever, they did offer to give us a second helping鈥ven though we thought this place was a little better, we declined as we were still not impressed鈥his was no Rudy Tuesday. Option 4 (The French restaurant) - We didn鈥檛 get a chance to eat there so I have no comment. (Reservations required) Option 5 (Hibachi Grill) - The hibachi grill located in the Asian restaurant. All the food is loaded with way too much soy sauce鈥ike licking a salt lick. The egg rolls and dumplings they serve were once frozen. If you know what Japanese food from a hibachi grill should taste like, then you won鈥檛 like this place. On the other hand, if you鈥檙e the type that has never used chopsticks before, then you鈥檒l probably love this place. (Reservations required)Option 6 (Chinese Food and Sushi) - This restaurant is also located in the Asian restaurant as well, but you don鈥檛 need reservations. They serve fake sushi (California rolls鈥o raw fish) and Chinese food. We did not try the Chinese food or the fake sushi. Options 7 and 8 (Taino Caribbean Restaurant) - The featured food at this restaurant is Mexican food (option 7)鈥ut take my word on this鈥he Mexican food they serve makes Taco Bell seem like a gourmet restaurant. Option 8 is by far the best food to eat at the resort. Option 8 is the Dominican Soup and Salad Bar that is located inside the Mexican restaurant鈥ut don鈥檛 be fooled, the Dominican food they serve is not just soup and salad鈥hey serve pork, chicken, beef, goat (just try it鈥ts very good), sweet plantains, beans and rice. Remember, when traveling to a different county, you should try the local food鈥hy鈥ecause that鈥檚 what the know how to cook!!!!!!!! Funny story, I told some guy at the Asian restaurant that only good food at the resort was the Dominican Soup and Salad bar鈥e responded with these exact words 鈥淚 know鈥 agree with you鈥鈥檓 one of the people that makes this whole resort possible鈥濃€asically, the guy, who I think was an owner or investor, told me that that food at this resort sucks and agreed that the best food was the Dominican food at the Mexican Restaurant.The BeachThe beach is gorgeous鈥t least if you don鈥檛 mind the occasional seaweed build up. Up and down the entire beach (at all the Punta Cana resorts), seaweed drifts down the entire coast. The amount of seaweed along the Majestic鈥檚 stretch of the beach varied from day to day鈥ometimes it was hard to avoid it as it wrapped around my ankles. However, it wasn鈥檛 a big deal on most days. The seaweed does build up on the beach鈥ind of ugly, but they rake it up every few days. Even so, a nicer resort would remove the seaweed each morning. As for the water itself, it鈥檚 crystal clear (when calm). I鈥檓 not sure what the temperature was, but it was prefect and refreshing. One caution though鈥f you鈥檙e bring your children, keep in mind that the water gets deep pretty fast鈥t was over my head about 20 to 25 feet out (7 to 8 meters). There weren鈥檛 too many rocks鈥 only found one area were I couldn鈥檛 avoid stepping on some rocks鈥hey are hard to see as they are the same color as the sand. As for the beach, the sand is white and soft鈥ots of chairs and umbrellas. However, on some days, small roots are exposed that are annoying to step on鈥ther days, the roots were covered by the sand鈥robably covered the same day the seaweed was raked off the beach. Other than that, the beach is generally clean鈥otel workers are always walking around picking up trash. (FYI, if you want an umbrella, place your towel on the chair under the umbrella before 10am鈥lthough some people dropped their towels at 9am and didn鈥檛 return to their spot till hours later鈥lease don鈥檛 be one of those people). There are plenty of activities on the beach. Every morning around 10:30am, an aerobics class is held on the beach. Keep in mind that the instructor plays the same load music every morning that can be heard from every point on the beach鈥ind of annoying when you are trying to relax or recover from a night of drinking鈥o bring your ipod to drown out the sound. This lasts for about an hour. Around 12 noon, the same aerobics instructors begin recruiting beach goers to participate in the daily beach Olympics (egg tossing, tug of war鈥hat sort of thing)鈥gain, they play the same loud music every day. This lasts for about an hour as well. There鈥檚 another aerobics class around 2pm as well鈥nly this time the class is located closer to the waters edge. All of these activities are free. The resort also has your standard non-free activities, but I think they were overpriced鈥?25 for 10 minutes of water skiing. (FYI, there is no bar on the beach and no waitresses taking drink orders on the beach) The PoolThe Pool is very appealing to look at鈥ot to mention enormous鈥aybe two and half football fields long (about 200 meters). There are four bars at the pool, including a swim up bar. About every hour or so, a waitress does walk around taking drink orders. Most of the action at the pool takes place near the bar that is connected to the swim up bar. Here you can participate in more organized activities, aerobics, and pool volleyball. Again, the aerobics music is loud, annoying and the same every single day. The pool is large enough to find a quiet spot鈥ometimes鈥owever, you can鈥檛 control large groups of loud people that migrate to the quiet section鈥hat鈥檚 what happens at these huge resorts. If you are looking for a quiet vacation, then this place is not for you. The RoomsWhat鈥檚 the deal with these bathrooms? I didn鈥檛 quite get it from the reviews I read. Everyone was complaining about the privacy of bathrooms, mainly the toilet. Let me explain. The privacy of the toilet is that same as the privacy you would experience while in a public bathroom鈥nly, your girlfriend can hear every loud noise you make at 3am鈥nd the walls that help amplify the sound which doesn鈥檛 help the situation鈥 hope you don鈥檛 get sick. The toilet stall is not a separate room. The door to the stall does not reach the ground nor does it reach the ceiling. One of the toilet stall walls is shared with the shower wall, which does not reach the ceiling either. This does not help contain the your normal bathroom smell鈥f you catch my drift. The shower on the other hand is great鈥arge enough for two people. The showerhead is detachable and the water pressure is great鈥ood for getting the sand off your legs. The bed is hard鈥ut its not bad鈥fter a long day on the beach, falling asleep was pretty easy. The pillows are soft, but very thin鈥ust ask for extra pillows and you鈥檒l be fine. The A/C takes a little while to kick in, but it eventually makes the room nice and cool鈥ou can lower the temperature to 20 degrees Celsius (68 F). The TV has about 37 channels鈥ost in English.The Casino The casino is small. It has about 8 card game tables, a roulette table, about 15 slot machines, and a bar. I only played blackjack, which has a minimum bet of $5 and maximum bet of $100. Watch out for the blackjack dealers, they don鈥檛 always know how to count. You can only bet with the American dollar or Dominican Peso.The DiscoThe Disco is right next to the casino. It has a few pool tables, a large bar, many couches and longing areas, a small dance floor, and a wrap around bar. I didn鈥檛 go inside, but it seemed like the only music they played was house music鈥ot my cup of tea. The ServiceFor the most part, the service was fine. The only negative I had was that they gave us the wrong room鈥nd it took some haggling to get them to switch us. Apparently, there was a long list of people who were given the wrong room.

<Content>Great Deal! Would go back! We traveled to the Majestic 2/10-2/17. We had a great time and thought it was an awesome deal. The room was ready on arrival. They did forget to give us our towel cards when arriving though and we had to go back to get them. We booked through Cheap Caribbean. I have booked before with them and I will continue to go to them first. They seem to have better prices than a lot of the other sites and provide excellent customer service. We had room 4316 facing a fence and we has a little bit of a view of the ocean. The room was a little noisy some nights from the entertainment. Also the hotel cleaning staff could be heard early in the morning. There were no clocks in the room. The bathrooms weren鈥檛 very private. You would be able to hear anything anyone is doing in there. The toilet is in a little stall with a frosted glass half of a door. The pool was perfect. There is nothing you could really ask for more in a pool. The resort is showing a lot of wear and tear for such a new place. The bathrooms over by the disco/casino/sports bar were gross. They did an awful job with the tile/grout work and this place will need a major overall in a couple years if it expects to still be a 5 star place. The grounds and landscaping are very nice. They spend a lot of time grooming them. Also I didn鈥檛 notice a lot of bugs. I got one mosquito bite. (usually I am eaten alive) We took anti-malaria meds as recommended by CDC when traveling to Punta Cana, but my boyfriend didn鈥檛 get bit at all. The ocean was a little seaweed-y. I think some people put their towels in the chairs under the huts on the beach when they weren鈥檛 even on the beach all day, which is unfortunate. You could get a hut on the beach though as long as you were there by 10am so it wasn鈥檛 like you had to be up at sunrise or anything. The beach wasn鈥檛 too crowded. You could walk past other resorts and people seemed a little more crammed in at some of the other places. However, there are not enough bathrooms either -- 2 stalls in ladies room for beach/pool area. There was always a line. Staff is constantly trying to clean them though. The food was so-so. It was better than some other all inclusives I have stayed at before. All Inclusives are not exactly known for great food. We did have a little but of stomach troubles despite drinking Pepto-Bismo everyday. We brought the Pepto with us. You wouldn鈥檛 want to pay the gift shop prices. WAY expensive. They just are trying to gourge you in those places. We were able to find quite a few different food chosies that were ok despite the fact I can be picky and my boyfriend is allergic to nuts and eggs. If you eat eggs, the eggs were probably the best thing for breakfast too since they are cooked fresh to order. The fruit was very good too. I was a little disappointed you couldn鈥檛 order a bloody mary or anything like that though. They did have some cheap champagne over by the OJ dispenser though. They don鈥檛 seem to be concerned too much with keeping cold foods cold or hot foods hot. There are also a lot of flies in the beach restaurant that sit on the food. The best places to go we the French and Japanese (of course the only two where you need reservations). At the French place we ordered Surf and Turf which was a breaded steak stuffed with a small piece of lobster and it was pretty good. We had lobster at the seafood place and it was the worst lobster I ever had, but it wasn't awful. They also always ask you if you have had enough so if you wanted two of those little alien lobsters, they would be happy to give you another. The meat wasn鈥檛 super high quality, like a fancy steakhouse or anything but it was certainly better than fast food. The Mexican was also decent. People were raving about guacamole. They have a nacho bar as well 鈥?got to love that. We talked with some other people on the beach from other resorts and it sounded like the Majestic had better food then the competitors. We went on an Outback Safari tour and the food provided was almost exactly like the Majestic鈥檚 food and the people from all the other resorts were claiming that the food provided by the excursion company was much better than their resort food. So I guess the so-so Majestic food is as good as it gets in the Dominican. Staff is very friendly. They ask you how you are and when you respond, they smile and nod. I don鈥檛 think most of them know more then some basic phrases in English. I don鈥檛 think learning some Spanish before you go will help you much like some previous posters suggested though. What simple phrases you would learn are probably the same simple phrases they already know. The bars up front did have premium liquors. A couple times they tried to tell me they were out and I was like I can see it right there and they went ahead and poured it. I don't think they were trying to hide it, I think they just didn't know what I was asking for. It would be nice if they had some more variety over at the beach and pool bars. The premium liquors were reserved to the bars in the lobby. They ask you for your room number if you order a premium drink, but you are not charged for them. They are also constantly asking you if you want another drink. Doesn鈥檛 matter if it is some fancy frozen thing, coffee, or a beer. The photos the staff took (the ones you have to pay for) were awesome. We got a couple with animals and they came out perfect. It also looked like you could do some sort of photo shoot with them, I am not really sure of the details because it isn鈥檛 advertised and they never approached us about it, but there were a lot of people in the photo shop going through some very professional pictures.We were going to use the spa since it looked beautiful but it was a little too expensive so we went on the excursion instead. When we arrived at the airport it was like our plane was the only one there, the place was so empty. When we left our van dropped us off 2 hours 45 mins before departure and we almost missed our flight. It was awful. No a/c, babies screaming, and over 2 and a half hours in line. The security people don鈥檛 even look at the monitors as your bag goes through either making this miserable process pointless and thus even more frustrating! The resort shows were a little cheesy, but they try real hard. They also have waitresses in the theatre which I thought was nice. A lot of the other places I have stayed at didn鈥檛 have service come to you. The band they played at the pool bar at night was great and so was the sax player. The casino was pretty small and not very busy. We never stayed up for the disco, but I doubt it every really got going seeing the lack of crowds out that late. Overall this was a great beach vacation 鈥?beach and pool were awesome, customer service was good, the food was really the worst part but I went here to get out of cold snowy NY and relax which is what I did and I didn鈥檛 starve. I would go here again. I though it was a great deal.It is always easier to write about the bad than the good, but this place is very nice.

<Content>Simply the Best......................... This was our second stay at The Majestic. Congratulations to Ricardo Espinosa {General Manager} and his ever friendly and accommodating staff for making yet another memorable visit to the DR. When we stayed last February the resort had only been open approximately 8 weeks. The staff were very attentive,yet a little green and hesitant in their execution. What a difference a year makes. The grounds are now mature, spectacular and maticulously groomed. Food was great last year and even better this year. Housekeeping, Room beverage and Bartenders get AAA+++. {Some of the staff recognized us from last year and we were greeted with Hola, Amigo, a hug and a kiss} As I stated last year, don't be hesitant to tip staff for exceptional service. The staff really appreciate the gesture and very quickly acknowledge it with their attentiveness. We once again stayed in one of the few Ocean Front suites. Although a little more expensive, the views of the pristine water and the access to the beach and the beach front bar make it worth while. If you are looking to be pampered, enjoy 85 to 87 degree sunny days and are in need to relax and recharge, the Majestic Colonial is the place for you. Hola, Ricardo. Send our best wishes to our extended DR family. Keep up the great work. See you next February.

<Content>The Beach is breathtaking!! Highly recommend this resort especially if you have children.We stayed there (6 adults 2 children 13  11  1 toddler 2 yrs) from 2/10-2/16 and we loved it. The hotel still needs some tweaking here and there. The rooms are immaculate and my only complaint about the room is there is no privacy if you are staying with a family in one room. As soon as you open the door the bathroom is right there with no doors. The bathtub (jacuzzi) and two sinks are out in the open. The toilet area has a door but no room to change and the shower stall is amazing it could fit a whole family in it!!!!! We left a few bucks every day about $3 so she would leave extra towels. I would call them the 1st day and tell them how many towels you will need each day. You are only allowed 1 pool/beach towel per person. Here is some advice if you are traveling with children, bring your own Suntan Lotion!!! It will cost you at least $20.00 to buy it there and bring your own pail and shovel if you are traveling with kids. I had to buy my son a ball which was $8 and a bucket w/shovel which cost $24.00!! The prices are outrageous if you need items. Bring your own diapers and wipes as well, very limited in a brand I never heard of. The milk is served hot so learn this phrase Leche Frio which means cold milk. If you ask at the buffet (breakfast) they will give you one to take to the room. The pool is amazing always something going on there. I loved it there and its great for children  adults. All the premade beverages are NON Alcoholic so ask them to put the Rum in 1st!!!! Throw them a few bucks and they'll remember you... The best drinks are in the lobby area. My overall rating is excellent just don't expect much on the food. Stay away from the Chinese Food we all got sick. Also the liquor is low end you can pay for premium. Bring your own travel clock there are no clocks in the room, thank god I read reviews before I went and it helped me out tremendously!!! The beach also is amazing just there is no waitress service at the beach, expect alot of walking which is good so you can burn off the food from the buffet. You will also have to figure out what restaurant has what at what time they don't have a schedule. But these are little things that can be overlooked. The weather is picture picture but make sure you use a spf I used a 50 and still burned...I hope you stay is as memorable as ours was. We were very impressed with the resort itself and how well kept and maintained they keep it. If you plan to go to Punta Cana you must stay here. Even the locals will tell you its the best Resort in the area!!!! Just make sure you have alot of singles  $5's with yoU... The Moore Family, NJ

<Content>a great Valentine's getaway We had a great stay at the Majestic for a quick 5 day getaway during Valentine's week. We are a married couple in our mid forties, celebrating an anniversary. Most of the guests this week appeared to be older than we were, although as the American holiday weekend approached, the crowd got a little younger. Our garden view room turned out to have a beautiful, unobstructed ocean view, near the beach, on the quiet side of the hotel. We were thrilled. We spent most of our time in the shade on the lovely beach. The weather was perfect, mid 80's with a breeze all week. The pool was clean and beautiful. It was long and always seemed uncrowded. We had no problems with communication or service. All staff and servers were friendly, cheerful and patient with our bad Spanish. We tipped moderately but inconsistantly, and never felt that the good service was dependent on a tip. The food was plentiful and wholesome. with lots of choices. Some of it was very good, and some was mediocre, but nothing was terrible. All of it was presented beautifully. The decorations and fruit sculptures (with a Valentine's theme) were outstanding. The beds were what we expected. The mattress was very, very firm and the pillows were about one inch thick (I rolled mine up into a bolster shape), but the sheets were clean and nicely made up each day. We would definitely like to return sometime. This would be a good place to take a group of friends, if only to have some other English speakers to talk/socialize with. The language differences meant that most of the guests (if not part of a large wedding and family group) tended to stay to themselves.

<Content>10 days of Bliss!! My husband and I just returned from 10 glorious days at the Majestic. We arrived Feb 8th - Feb 17th. I spent alot of time reading the reviews to ensure we had evrything we needed (and them some) so hopefully I can answer all the questions I was looking for.The place is gorgeous, staff very friendly and helpful. We arrived early in the day so our room was not going to be ready til 3pm. So take along the swimsuits or shorts in your carry on. They have great washrooms for changing or showering in the lobby. Well thought out.Rooms - if you want be closest to the pool the 2000 buildings are where you want. Starting with 2100 is closest to the lobby and the 2150's is closest to the ocean. 21's are ground floor, 22's are second etc. The 1000 building overlooks the next resort and the 4000 - 3000 are on the other side of the walkway. Hope this helps. We had room 2136 which was perfect. Ground floor, outside jacuzzi - Right by the pool, volleyball, activities, swimup bar. If you want the action that's the area to be. We brought a bunch of do not disturb signs but you don't need them, the rooms have motion sensors in them to let the staff know when no one is in the room. First class rooms all the way. We found the food great in all restaurants, and you can always get seconds. Most of the wine was very good, if you are a rye drinker (CC or Crown Royal) bring your own. The only place we could get CC was at the big lobby bar and you had to pay for it. They have lots of whiskey but not rye. Everything else was fine.The shows were good, they had sound trouble the night we went to the Micheal Jackson show so it wasn't as good as we'd heard - but the entertainers are very talented.I forgot the pillows!!! They have resolved that problem we had three big fluffy pillows and two king size pillows. We loved the firm beds - slept like babies.Can't say any more about the gorgeous beach except they need to clear the seaweed in the water a bit more often. Long walks on the beach were great. Lots of chairs and huts, unfortunately people are very selfish and save chairs and never even come down. But they have lots. The beach bar has a beautiful view, we could stay there all day.The sax player they have most nights is fantastic I couldn't get my husband off the dance floor and we had to buy his CD to bring back all the great memories. They did a great job on valentines day, balloons everywhere, flowers and T shirts for the men. Nice touch.I would have liked to have heard more upbeat, local music being played around the lobby etc. especially when you arrive, you're excited about being there and hear elevator music in the lobby, sorry I can hear that at home. We met alot of great people and staff are tremendous. One more thing - bring your own bandaids (fabric not plastic) lots if you get blisters - they charge $2US for about 5 bandaids and they are not good. Hope I haven't missed anything, we'd go back in a heartbeat, this was our 2nd trip to PC and are already saving for next year.

<Content>Can't go wrong with the Majestic! Just got back from a week at the Majestic Colonial in the Dominican Republic Punta Cana Feb 9th- 16th. To start I highly recommend the resort and leaving on a Friday to Friday. We traveled with our family of four and another family of four. We did not have to wait in line other than for 5 minutes at the Domincan airport. Everything just seemed to fall into place!The hotel was very good! The food was plentiful and delicious. The buffet that was offered at Valentine's day was the best I have ever seen not just in the presentation but also in the selection and taste. The best part of this resort other than the fact that it is not huge is that the restaurants did not require reservations other than for the Japenese restaurant and the Le Gourmet restaurant. Never had a problem getting in at the time you wanted. Service was very good!The staff were friendly and very accomodating! They genuinely love children! The kids club was excellent! Maggie and Maria who took care of the children were wonderful and made the children feel at ease which in turn made the parents feel comfortable. All four of our girls had a great time and enjoyed the mornings they spent at the club on the waterslides. and drawing pictures. The kids club facility was extremely clean. The resort offered entertainment both for the kids and the adults in the evening. We enjoyed the shows.The rooms were very nice ....huge showers and a bath in the rooms. The balconies were very large. The rooms overlooking the pool were nice. Spacious and very clean!We would highly recommend this resort to anyone considering the Dominican Republic. The beaches were gorgeous as was the pool that ran through the whole resort. Never had a problem finding a spot on the beach and pool provided you got out to reserve your spot by 9 am or so. A few of us had tummy problems temporarily but that is what happens when you go to a different country and indulge in a lot of different things. Although I am not a doctor I would highly recommend the Dukoral (travelers anti diaherea oral vacination) that can be prescribed by a physician. Worked for me! Just an extra percaution that could be and was worth the extra cost. Enjoy your vacation! Lay back and relax. Don't be in a hurray and you will get your monies worth and more from this resort!

<Content>Majestic Colonial Stayed at the Majestic Colonial Feb. 4 - 11. This resort is absolutely remarkable and we would return again without any hesitation. The grounds, buildings, etc. are extremely well maintained and absolutely breathtaking. Check out the chandelier in the lower lobby bar. It is amazing. The rooms are very comfortable. We found the beds and pillows to be very good as well as we had no problem at all with the layout of the bathroom. The room was cleaned very well and usually in the morning, and the fridge was restocked daily.The food is very good and plentiful in amounts. We ate several times in the Steak restaurant. It was our favourite. Good ribs, steaks, and even sausages. Plenty of variety also at the buffet, especially the fresh fruit and juices in the morning.The pool is amazing. You just stroll along the lazy river, sipping your fav. bevy.....never crowded. We always found chairs without having to play the towel game. And of course the entertainment staff was wonderful to watch. Not sure I will ever be able to learn the Taki Taki dance, but it was fun.The beach is beautiful and not at all overly crowded, considered the resort was full when we were there. The water is wavy but nothing that caused a red flag.On Thursday nights the resort brings in some of the local vendors to sell their goods, pictures, t-shirts, jewellery etc. And last but not least, all the staff, from the gardeners to the hotel manager are extremely friendly and helpful. This was a fabulous vacation.

<Content>Really nice My family (4 kids, 8 adults) stayed at the Majestic from 2/9-2/14. It's a beautiful resort, really nicely maintained with a great beach. This was my 5th Caribbean stay in the past 6 years and the Majestic was definitely the nicest of all of them. Unlike Iberostar, there was never a problem getting a chair by the beach or by the pool. There was a nice little area to play pool, foosball and ping pong when you get tired of the beach, lots of shopping (super-overpriced, however), and a kids area with water slides that our kids asked to go to hourly. Noise can be an issue so if you're going with small kids try to get a room not near elevators, and preferably closer to the beach. Food is just okay -- no real options for snacking during the day  pretty limited buffets (aside from breakfast). My family loved the steakhouse (no reservation required). No one liked the seafood restaurant (to the extent that all the guys -- including my 4-year-old -- went back to the steakhouse for a second dinner). The Mexican restaurant was great too. The Majestic has staff photographers who are always around and you can set up a time with them as well...we did a family portrait on the beach  the guy who did it was great (took 88 pictures!). The prices in the little market are insane, so if you've got small kids and don't feel like paying $5 for a can of pringles, $3 for gatorade, etc. bring your own snacks. We were in Punta Cana last year and found everything cheap...they seem to have realized in the intervening time that people will pay a lot of money when they have no choice. The Majestic is overall a much nicer resort than Iberostar, but with little kids I think I'd be inclined to go back to Iberostar because of the graduated pool (at Majestic you've either got to choose a somewhat deep kids pool -- my two-year-old wouldn't go in -- or the adult pool at 4+ feet) and the poolside eating area.

<Content>Wonderful place to get married and vacation! I recently returned from two weeks in Punta Cana having spent the first getting married at the Majestic and the second as our honeymoon at Secrets Excellence.The Majestic (to try and keep it brief):1) Resort - beautiful and well taken care of although very large. Some find the walk from the lobby/restaurants etc to the beach and certain rooms very long. Not a problem for us.2) Rooms- amazing. The glass on the shower and washroom doors are frosted and not a big deal with regards to privacy. Sometimes you may have to ask the person you're with to go on the balcony for a few minutes with regards to sounds......The showers are huge have great pressure and are wonderful and the jacuzzi tub is great too.3) Our room- I think we had room 2254 which was absolutely perfect. Ocean view second floor was ideal. We orginially started out in a larger suite however it was located up near the lobby so requested a smaller room beach front and was accomodated.4) Food- Loved the buffet and the steakhouse (for the grilled shrimp). I'm a vegetarian and had no difficulty finding a good variety of food. People in our group did not have great experiences with all the restaurants. We liked the buffet for the variety (although lacking in ambiance for dinners) and found breakfast, lunch and dinner there to be great. Food could be luke warm but it wasn't much of an issue. Lunch was great at the beach front buffet as well.5) Pool- Incredible. Always clean, always a good temperature and a fun place to hang around.6) Gym-not a lot of people write about this but my husband and I are both very much into training and working out (he's very much into weight training) so a good facility was important although difficult to find info on before hand! The gym is okay-decent free weights, hand weights and bench press. Some decent weight machines to work with although some very outdated and not useful. Lots of mats and balls to use.Two treadmills and two elipticals which were in great shape and fairly new. Can be very warm inside despite air conditioning. Great tunes usually going and several t.v. screens but no clock. We limited ourself to an hour a day and often had to guess at the time. There seems to be a Trainer in there but don't ask for any spots-he didn't know what it meant! All in all, decent for a week but we would have struggled for two weeks.7) Weddings- In short, I would highly recommend getting married here. Aurelio was very accomodating although we really didn't bug him too much as I know a lot of couples do! The wedding itself was on the beach and very private but unfortunately it was windy that night which was unusual. I would still recommend the beach over the gazebo as that's what the Caribbean is all about! Our wedding time was 6pm however started later due to the one Judge in the D.R. running slightly late. Due to this, our wedding pictures were taken in the dark-not ideal but they turned out okay. A warning to brides-if you plan to have the salon do your hair, make sure you do a trial run. Despite having pictures our hairstylist made a mess of our hair and we literally had to run back to our rooms with towels over our head less than an hour before the wedding to wash it and do it ourselves. Very stressful. The special touches the Majestic provided after the wedding (flower petals in the room and special bath, bath towel swans, breakfast delieverd the next day and a special dinner the next night) were wonderful extras which really made us feel special. Our wedding dinner table and cake was also beautifully done.I would recommend the Majestic in a heartbeat. We will definitely be returning to Punta Cana someday (possibly our five year anniversary) and it would be hard to decide between the Majestic and the Secrets Excellence.

<Content>Majestic Fantastic!!! We just came back from our wonderful vacation from Majestic Colonial Punta Cana All-Inclusive Resort from 2/3 to 2/10/07. There were a total of 3 couples (age range in 30s) and it was second time in Punta Cana for me and my husband. We usually book all of our Caribbean trips through cheapcaribbean.com and as always everything went smoothly. AIRPORT - We were greeted by local live band playing their music and took a group picture with Dominican Republic ladies with their custom. We paid $10/p for an entry fee and went thru the immigration desk and then walked out to meet our transportation guy provided by cheapcaribbean.com. LOBBY- We were transported by an air-conditioned van from the airport to the resort and greeted with a tropical cocktail at the lobby. Lobby was really clean and nice, marble floor and saw several shops. There were guest services desks right by the resort entrance where you would need to book your restaurant reservations for the Japanese and French restaurant. Other restaurants do not require reservations. At one of the guest services desks, you would meet Majestic Mike (he's Canadian) who was very helpful in everything that you need.GROUNDS- Very well maintained. Beautiful tall endless palm trees and tropical flowers everywhere. Workers were constantly working on them.POOL - Very big and long, amazing. You can stay near the lobby side if you want privacy and stay away from the noise, but if you want action, you can stay near the beach side for games and all.ROOMS - All 3 rooms got assigned to poolview which was great. We were in room 2221, 2321, 2323. Room was very spacious, equipped with mini fridge, coffee maker, safe, ceiling fan, Jacuzzi in the room and full blasting A/C. O, there was a bottle of champagne in each room, too. I asked Majestic Mike if our housekeeper can make a swan made out of the towels and sure enough, she brought it to us that evening. Each room had a huge balcony with a round table and two chairsBEACH - This is what we came for. What can I say. Absolutely amazing!!! Fine soft white sand with beautiful clear blue/green ocean water with palm trees everywhere. They had plenty of chairs and shade. Actually, compare to our resorts nearby, the Majestic had one of the longest beach. There was a local guy who brought different animals such as small monkeys, python, parrots each day and we took pictures with two different monkeys and bought the pictures from their photo shop at the resort.FOOD/DRINKS - Since we were there for 7 nights we tried pretty much all restaurants there. No problems with the food and drinks. Since we had the premieum bracelet (gray color), we were able to drink premieum drinks at bars (like Johnny Walker Red and such). There was a late night snack restaurant right by the casino and it was perfect to order hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, and such late at night.STAFF - everyone welcomed us with a big smile and if you couldn't be communicated by English, they would get someone who speaks English better to help you what you needENTERTAINMENT - They had different theme shows every night. During the day, they have all kinds of activities that you can join or to watch. My husband got picked to participate in Mr. Majestic game which he didn't win, but received a bottle of rum for participation which was cool.CASINO - It's small, but they pretty much had regular casino tables and slot machines. I won $400 total by playing at Roulette table so I can't complain!! It was awesome.DISCO - We were there during the Super Bowl week and they set up the disco bar with finger foods and showed the game on their big screen TVs which was good. We went there one night to join the other guests to dance which was fun.WATER SPORTS AT THE BEACH - they are usually free and we rented a kayak and snorkling gear.EXCURSIONS - Excursions are not part of the all-inclusive package. We did two excursions. ATV ride tour and stopping by at the underwater cave to swim. The other one was Caribbean Festival which was riding the party boat and snorkeling and swimming with the nurse sharks and stingrays. AIRPORT - We bought MamaJuana as a souvienir from Caribbean Festival excursion. It's bunch of herbs packed in a bottle with our own photo posted on the front of the bottle. They said it's like Dominican Republic aphrodisiac. haha... At the airport before we checked in, the security guard told us that we won't be able to take it on the plane if there is no liquid in the bottle so we poured the bottle of rum which my husband won from one of the games he participated at the resort, into the bottle and then security guard allowed us to proceed to the check in desk. Overall, we had a great time and were very pleased with their services and property. It's really cold and snowing in the East coast now so I certainly do miss the Majestic very much now. I highly recommend anyone who wants to have fantastic time in Punta Cana. Go to the Majestic Fantastic!!! :-)

<Content>All-inclusive fun in the sun Just returned from 6 days at the Majestic Colonial (Feb 6-12) and had a fabulous time. We were very leery about going to an all-inclusive but were pleasantly surprised, especially after reading some of the negative reviews on this site.First off, the hotel was beautiful and spotless with a pool that was the most unique one we've ever seen. The beach was fantastic with plenty of lounge chairs and shaded areas. The service was quite impressive and the staff went out of their way to greet you with a smile and a hola whenever they walked by. The room was very spacious and the balcony was quite large with great views from the upper floors. We happily didn't encounter a mosquito during our entire stay so the bug spray went unused. Now for the slightly negative, the food (and wine). No problem whatsoever with the buffet breakfasts. Food was plentiful with a great assortmenet including a pancake/waffle station, an omelet station and an eggs to order station. Add to that fresh fruits, yogurt, cereal, french toast, bacon  sausage and you had a perfect start to your day. Lunch, on the other hand, was a disappointment, perhaps because we weren't all that hungry but the selection was quite boring (and always the same). Dinners were varied. We had great meals at the seafood and steak restaurants (no reservations needed) and mediocre meals at the Gourmet (reservation required) restaurant and Asian a la carte restaurant (no reservation needed except for the Hibachi section). Try to get a reservation for the Hibachi dinner because that was our best meal of the week The wine (from Spain) was more like vinegar but the beer on tap was quite good. They didn't use top shelf liquor so some of the drinks were just average. However, the Majestic was very good as were some of their other specialty fruit drinks, i.e. dirty monkey, bahama mama, strawberry dacquiri and pin a colada). There were 8 or 9 bars and we never had to wait long for a drink. All in all, I would give this vacation a big thumbs up and would definitly consider returning..

<Content>"If You're in the Dominican ....You can't go wrong" Just returned from Majestic and had a delightful time. This was my second time to the Dominican. The Majestic was a nice resort. We had absolutely no problems with the food and we tasted everything. The food was always fresh and hot and there was plenty of variety. The breakfeast was our favorite. They had an omelette station, fresh fruit, quiche, homemade doughnuts all breakfeast meats and really anything you would typically desire for breakfeast. Also delicious Dominican coffee and fresh pineapple, guava, passion fruit juice, etc. Our favorite restaurant was the Rodeo grill steakhouse(anything taste good off the grill):) The room was nice. I would compare it to a Holiday Inn, it was not luxurious, for a new hotel , some steps were missed in construction, I did notice the painting and ceiling were a bit shoddy. I also agree with the other travel advisors that the bathroom set up was strange. The toilet was located behind a frosted glass door and right next door was a large marble shower. If you are modest or traveling with a family this would not be ideal. There was no room to change your clothes in privacy, and when you step out the shower you basically were in the bedroom next to the bed. The bed was very hard but if you like a firm mattress as I do you will enjoy it. The pillows were very thin however there were extra pillows in the closet and once you doubled them up it was comfortable. The resort itself was very lovely, the pool weaving in and out of the resort was beautiful. The lobby, entertainment area, and all restaurants were nice. The beach was wonderful, soft, white sand and beautiful clear water that was warm. All beach lovers must visit the Dominican for this reason alone. Tha average temperature during my stay (Feb 9-12th) was 83 F. The staff spoke English well enough and were very accomodating. The spa was nice, however be warned,again, you modest ones, the attendant does not leave the room when you undress (unless you request). The spa menu was good and offered a variety of standard services, including couples massage. Please do not miss the Michael Jackson show on Sunday nighrs. Also I highly recommend an all day excursion with Jurrasic Safari or Mountain View Safari so you can really get an idea what Dominican life is like. I agree with the others, please tip everyone if you were pleased with the services. The average income for a Dominican family is $250USD a month. In conclusion I liked the Majestic but I liked the Riu Palace a lot more(see my previous review) but hey either one you can't go wrong in the Dominican...ENJOY!!

<Content>Romantico time My Wife and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial from Feb 2-9, 2007.We had a wonderful time and here are some of our thoughts on our stay:AIRPORT - nice and clean and organized we didn't have to wait very long to receive our luggage, but unfortunately there was no sign to direct us to our bus. Other people waiting around for a long time until they found their bus Need clear directions for travelers.RESORT ENTRANCE - Upon entering the resort you notice a stark contrast from poor area to rich area. The very front entrance of Majestic could use some landscaping. We passed Gran Bahia and their front entrance looked amazing, beautiful flowers everywhere.POOL - what an amazing pool. So grand and spacious yet pockets for everyone. If you wanted action you can play volleyball, if you wanted to relax you just swim into the whirlpool areas, if you want seclusion you just swim around one of the many twists and turns that run from one end of the property to the other. Clean when we arrived, but as the week went on it became a little dirty with leaves and debris, but still very beautiful.GROUNDS - Very well maintained. Always grooming and cleaning. The selection of plants and flowers and the varying displays and landscaping was enthralling. Everywhere you walking you see different arrangement of flowers and plants, it makes the resort look even larger and grandiose. BEACH - Make sure you put on some sun block because once you start walking on this beach you will just keep on going until you realize you have walked for hours. The beaches here have wonderful fine white sand, no rocks, shells or seaweed and not just at Majestic, but for as far as you can walk in either direction. Plenty of chairs and shade for everyone. No issues with pushy vendors when we were there.ROOMS - We had an ocean view room with a king size bed and it was great - what a beautiful view and the sound of the ocean waves was memorizing. For me, the hard bed was fine, but the pillows were too soft and thin for the hotel of this caliber. Our room had cathedral ceiling, double sinks, larger shower with bench, but the cramped toilet area takes some getting used to. The safe was included which was nice.SPA - Didn't try it, but loved the fountain they had inside the grounds, maybe next time.FOOD - I read all the reviews about not to expect much quality in the Caribbean and I'm glad we did lower our expectations because that helped us to enjoy the food more. Majestic had great variety and everything was fresh including all the salads, fruits and vegetables. I personally stayed away from cold meats and chesses, but they looked fine. We loved the French and Japanese (too bad I wasn't that hungry that night, but it was delicious). All restaurants were clean, chairs were comfortable utensils clean and the service was prompt and friendly. The ambiance in most restaurants were very romantic especially by the ocean - nothing like having dinner with moonlight and rolling waves behind you. DRINKS - This is were you MUST lower your expectations. I tried a Pina Colada and other fruit drinks, but that was a mistake - terrible. Thank God they had endless amounts of bottled water.STAFF- Cleaning staff were very thorough with our room and restocked our fridge every day. Actually we should give a big thank you to Francisco for helping us with our check-in. We had a problem with our room and he certainly made our stay that much more enjoyable by providing us with a great room.ENTERTAINMENT - We loved the Micheal Jackson show and the acrobats, but the others were just so so. Movies for kids every night as well.SPORTS - Beach volleyball was fun, basketball court needs resurfacing (bad shape). Tried to play some tennis when they had a scheduled tournament, but no staff showed up. Courts looked good (they also had a clay court - sort of). Lots of activities to do.Last but not least, we absolutely loved the piano and sax nightly performances. Especially the sax player, it seemed every time he saw us he would say that its Romantico Time and prompt us to dance and we did!I would definitely recommend this resort. A very relaxing and satisfying stay. We had a blessed stay.

<Content>My Wedding at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana Anyone thinking of getting married South do it!! I highly recommend it and I highly recommend the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. We went down Jan 24, 2007 with a group of 45 people. Aurelio the wedding coordinator was terrific and took care of all of my requests and plans. He promptly replied to all my emails and then set up a meeting at the resort to finalize everything. He is very professional and wants you to be happy and satisfied.We were married on the beach at 3PM followed by dinner and then we booked the disco out privately for 2 hours for our speeches, dances and cake. It all flowed very smoothly. The beach was absolutely beautiful and the photographer was amazing. You have to book the photographer. He had all the great beach wedding photo ideas and then we bought the cd instead of printing photo's out.I used a company wedo.com to get all my papers translated into Spanish and stamped by the embassy.The food at the Majestic was good, service good, disco was a lot of fun and we really enjoyed the disco. Only warning is to monitor your intake of Bahama Mama drinks or any fruit drink for that matter.. if you drink too many your body will react and then people blame it on the food on these forums saying that is what made them sick giving the resort a bad reputation.[---]

<Content>fantastic holiday from belleville This was our first time to Punta Cana and would go back in a heart beat. The Majestic is a beautiful resort . It was very clean all over the resort. We had great service as we were in a group of 12 people. The people are friendly in all parts of the resort. The beach was great and really clean.We did parasailing and had no problem very professional.Our room was clean every day and restocked with out any problem we were in room 3222 and had a great view of the pools.In the buffet we had Franky wait on us and on our last day he did the table with fresh flowers for our send off. He was great on looking after us everyday. So if you go look for him he will look after you.The Micheal Jackson show was really great. very entertaining.We used the internet everynight and had no problem with getting a connect. Very quickly at connecting.The drinks were great. You must try the majestic and the dirty monkey both really nice to drink.I would highly recommend this resort to anyone.

<Content>A Fantastic Vacation! My husband and I vacationed at The Majestic Colonial in mid-November of 2006...although it was a few months ago..I felt as though I still had to share our wonderful vacation experience. The hotel is absolutely breathtaking. We were fortunate enough to get a room facing the pool along with our own private Jacuzzi on our patio. The service was excellent  the staff was extremely courteous and helpful. I would be remiss to mention the fact that there was a slight language barrier; knowing a little Spanish would be extremely helpful. However, we never ran into a problem with this, there certainly were enough staff around that spoke fluent English so if need be there was always somebody to communicate effectively with. My husband  I had been on a few cruises before but never vacationed at an all-inclusive resort before so we were a little reluctant to try this. It absolutely proved to be one of the best and most relaxing vacations we ever had! The beach was gorgeous. You can sink your feet right into the salt-like sand (not that coarse sand-papery sand), and the best part was that no matter how warm the temperature got, the sand was never too hot to walk on, the water was just the right temp and getting a comfortable lounge chair on the beach was not a problem (although getting to the beach by 10AM is highly recommended if you want to put your chair under one of the palm trees!). The food was delicious and plentiful. There were many choices of food, however, there were 2 restaurants that we needed to make reservations for: the sushi restaurant and the Gourmet Restaurant. Well worth the wait! They really were great! The room we stayed in was lovely. Spacious and bright  the housecleaning staff did a good job of keeping the room clean. We brought our laptop computer down with us so we can stay connected to our family..there was a minimal charge for this but it was nice having the Internet connection in our room. The nightly entertainment was pretty good. Some nights, were better than others, but they mixed it up enough that there was something for everybody. There were a few nights that we decided not to go to the entertainment but rather walked on the beach or around the hotel or went to the casino. It is just that beautiful! The guests at the hotel were very nice. We met people from all over the world! The best part was that although I believe that the week we were there, the hotel was almost at full-capacity, it never felt crowded, we always had our 鈥渙wn space鈥? All in all, we made a great choice, it was a fantastic vacation...we would (and plan to) to go back again in the future!

<Content>One of the Best in 15 yrs. My husband and I have been travelling to the Caribbean and Mexico for 15 years. This hotel ranks right up there with one of the best yet!! We stayed for 2 weeks and never experienced one inconvenience or problem. The a la carte restaurants were great and the food was wonderful. The beach and the ocean were pristene. The pool was great for just walking from one end to the other. It was never busy or noisy and we chatted to people along the way. We both celebrated birthdays while at the resort. The guest service manager, Mike, made sure our special days did not go unnoticed. My table at the Gourmet restaurant was strewn with flowers and the staff all sang Happy Birthday and made us both feel very special. Mike went out of his way also, to set up the gazebo for a couple celebrating their 40th anniversary. This was not in the plans until the daughter ( who was getting married the next day) happened to mention that her parents were celebrating their 40th . The couple were treated to their own waiter and had the place to themselves. What a nice touch, Mike!All in all, I would highly recommend the Majestic to anyone. People who nit pick about pillows and the little things lose out on enjoying all the positives of such a resort. Every resort will have flaws but while on vacation just enjoy.

<Content>A Piece of Paradise It was our first time to the DR, as well as our first time trying all-inclusive and we were impressed with both. We are not-hard-to-please Canadians, and found everything to our liking. The trip from the Airport was fine, and the road is under construction, but you can tell that mass improvements are under way. Check in left ALOT to be desired. We spent about 1 1/2 hours trying to get 3 rooms together (3 couples) which was impossible even though we had emailed ahead. Some of the staff just couldnt care less. We ended up with 2 couples on the 4th floor on one end and one couple at the other extreme end of the bldg on the ground floor. Tipping was readily accepted, but made absolutely no difference in service. One couple ended up with double beds, and we all had a view that left alot to be desired~a chain link fence that had fallen half over. So the first day was a total writeoff after check in taking so long. But,....we did make up for it in the restaurant, and after a few bottles of wine, it really didnt matter much!~~enjoyed ourselves anyhow!Weather was terrific. Rained a few minutes here and there, and then cleared off and was beautiful. One week was definitely NOT long enough as the crew we were with werent into doing tours or anything~~maybe if we had had more time. If we returned we would definitely do a tour or two. Would have definitely done the tour that takes you to a school, etc. Brought gifts for the students and just ended up passing them with Majestic Mike, who, by the way, told us that emailing ahead of time to request a certain floor, etc, does you no good whatsoever~just basically the luck of the draw upon check-in. The boys did go golfing which they enjoyed~course was nice.Animation team does a great job~~we really enjoyed the games we participated in. Left gifts for them as they deserved it.The food was great. We were unable to book into the Japanese rest. though; they definitely need to add another Japanese dining room there as the 2 they have now are just not sufficient. Most people dont realize that there is a Chinese food rest that is adajcent to the Japanese that requires no reservation. We preferred the Steakhouse and the Mexican restaurant best. I have a cast-iron stomach and had no trouble all week though the hubby ate a few Immodium along the way. We tried many new foods, and thoroughly enjoyed it all! My favourites were the imported pasta and sauces, calamari, shrimp, fries, and the made to order omelettes for Breakfast. Also be sure to try the fresh orange and passion fruit juice for Breakfast~delicious! The desserts were all incredible. The Ocean water was so warm! A fellow told us that the water was more turbulent than usual~that it usually is much calmer right after Christmas. We didnt think it was too bad~great for boogie-boarding! The beach went on for miles, and was incredibly postcard-perfect, and our resort beach was very clean....again, tip the workers who got up early each morning to clean it!The pool was the nicest we have ever seen.....amazingly long and very clean. We had great times around the pool. Make sure you take a ton of American one dollar bills with you for tipping and because many places will not give change. Do not take Travellers Cheques as a couple that was with us exchanged them at the desk, and they converted them to pesos first and then back to US dollars, and charged a huge fee for doing so, along with losing on the exchange. My good sunglasses and camera were either lost or stolen while there, but that was my own fault for not being more careful. Most folks were very good for keeping an eye out, but I think the camera went missing on the Thurs evening while shopping at the merchants who peddle their goods once a week. Majestic Mike assured us they were all searched as they left the resort, but I highly doubt that was true. We wondered how much Mike told us was true or not.....most employees there didnt have a high opinion of him for some reason, but wouldnt state why. We found most employees friendly (make sure to tip the gardeners, etc and those who dont see the tips often and could really use it~~the bartenders get ALOT of tips, and as I stated, it really doesnt get you any better service) Maid service was nothing great, but adequate. Again tipping made no difference. We left cash and gifts which they took and appreciated, but made no difference in the quality of service. Also know that it is 2 different people who do your room~one is the maid, and another person stocks the mini-bar, so leave tips/note requests for this person IN THE FRIDGE itself. The accomodations (hotel itself and rooms) were very impressive, and we had no complaints with either the pillows or the beds. It was nice to have a safe in each room.We tried many of the drinks which were all delicious and were glad we had brought the insulated cups with us as saved a few trips, and kept them cool.We had a fantastic holiday, and thought the Majestic to be a wonderful place to stay. We would go back in a heartbeat!

<Content>Absolutely Beautiful Vacation We stayed at the Majestic from Jan 24 to Jan 31/07 to attend our son's wedding, along with 42 other guests. We found this resort beautiful and the staff went out of their way to make this a very memorable occasion.The rooms were gorgeous, very well laid out and clean. King size beds, pillows a little flat, but if you asked you were provided with better pillows. No washcloths but clean towels daily. Fridge stocked daily. We did leave gifts for the maids daily but I was disappointed not to see the creations they make out of towels and flowers. Our bed was turned down daily and I did notice that our bed was changed daily. The food was excellent. We did have some people in our group that are vegetarians and there was always a variety of foods that they were able to eat. I think that anyone that complains about the food, first of all you are in a different culture and they do cook with oils and different spices. But on the whole there is no reason for anyone to go hungry and not be able to find something to fill them. From fresh juices, fruit, eggs, meats, breads, you name it they had it. All the speciality restaurants were delicious, except for the chinese which no one in our party enjoyed. Seafood, steak and buffet were scrumptous and I am not kidding.Beer, liquor, liquors they had it. Be careful as we were advised that the fruity type drinks act like a laxative and we all know what happens with laxatives. I asked for hot chocloate with Baileys and I think they thought I was nuts drinking this in the heat but I had quite a few of these. I witnessed people asking for the premium liquor and again it was provided.The Casino was alot of fun and we did have some winners in our group. Staff not always very helpul but who cares, you are there to have a good time and that is what we did. We ran out of money and my husband and BIL went to the 2nd resort past our resort as they have a bank on the premises. Bank is closed on Sundays and in less than 10 minutes we had american money. We went by water taxi ( 10 min boat ride)to shop down the beach and it had some different stuff . Also shopped at the market outside the resort ( 10 min walk go in earling morning as very hot) and again able to bargain. I found some of the locals got mad at you if you didn't give them what they wanted but still able to haggle with them.The younger people in our party went to the disco quite regularily and they had a great time. Didn't hear any complaints so they must have enjoyed themselves. I did hear there is a excellent eatery beside the disco that serves good burgers, fries ect.The beach and grounds are absolutely beautiful. Very clean, garbage picked up daily. I was on the beach very early, every am and the staff would have all the lounges straightened in rows and that is the first time I have seen this at any resort. We took air mattress's and had a awesome time in the waves. Also the snorkelling in front of our resort was good. The kids used the boogie boards and had a blast.Our son's wedding took place on the Saturday and again I can't say anything negative. Decorations and flowers were very nice, Mario the wedding co ordinator went out of his way to accomodate all of us. The weather also was awesome with a little breeze. We reside in Ontario and I have to compliment Mario the wedding planner on a spectacular job he and his staff provided for all of us. He was able to put everything together when we had never met and live on different sides of the world and there was just nothing else he could have done to have made this experience what it was. Thank you so much Mario....We ate every night at the speciality restaurants and he came on numerous occassions to see if all was ok. Our last night we ate at the steak house and the restaurant provided a smaller wedding cake and table decorated as well and my DIL thought we were sitting at the wrong table and maybe another wedding was to take place, but no they assured us this was for out party.Prior to the actual wedding the tables were always decorated in anticipation of a wedding and we were catered to, it was vey nice and again we were pampered.I would recommend this resort to anyone that wants to have a good time, enjoy beautiful weather and not have to worry about being safe. Most of the staff was very helpful and I did notice that there were a couple of staff members that did not know any English and did tell us that they did not understand what we wanted, but we were able to find someone to help us. For anyone going or looking for a resort to go to, you will not be disappointed. You have to remember that for the price, there is no reason not to have a very enjoyable and memorable vacation. Have fun, be safe and most of all enjoy.

<Content>Great experience at Majestic Colonial My husband and I just got back from the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. We were there from Jan 27-Feb 3/07,in a group of 11 people for my sister's wedding.Here are my comments:RESORT - Very nice resort. The grounds were beautifully maintained and it was easy to get around. The pool was fantastic - ran the entire length of the resort and was a consistent depth to allow you to walk through the water from one end to the other. The beach was beautiful too - we walked the 45 minutes down to the vendors shops and passed several other resorts along the way. We by far liked the set up at the beach of the Majestic as the chairs were not as crammed together and there was lots of sun. There were no high pressure sales people approaching you on the beach at the resort, which was great...but you could walk down the beach to the vendors if you wanted to shop and haggle.ROOMS - We had a pool view room and it was great - good size and good view. As others have mentioned, the beds were a bit hard but the pillows were fine.SPA - The bride and one of the bridesmaids in our group had their hair done at the spa the day of the wedding...both wanted their hair loosely curled and had pictures. The result was a disaster...they threw towels over their heads, ran to their rooms and washed it all out and started over again. If you are having your hair done for a wedding, I would definately say it would be worth your while to do a trial run in advance.FOOD - The food was OK, but lets get real...what do you expect....you don't go to the Caribbean for the food. From other 5 star resorts I have been to in the Caribbean, the Majestic is about on par. As we were part of a larger group, the variety offered seemed to be good enough for everyone (even the vegetarian in the group). There was never a long wait for tables or service or food. My only complaint was the issue that we had with our group reservation - Le Gourment seemed to have a big problem honouring our reservation for 11 people and argued with me for a while (until Majestic Mike helped us out).STAFF- The restaurant staff was very good -very attentive and always smiling. The maid service was mediocre (our room was not made up one day until we called that evening). Angel  Francisco at the front desk were both great and very helpful. We had a few issues come up that they tried to help us out with and always knew who we were and what it was about (unfortunately the items that I left in the room before we changed rooms never did turn up after 5 days of back and forth which was a little frustrating). And now for the best guy at the resort...MAJESTIC MIKE, hands down!!! This guy is great!!!! He works crazy hours and is very busy, but always finds time to chat and to help you with your problem and make you feel important as well. The best thing that the Majestic did was to hire Mike to head up their Guest Services department. It doesn't hurt that he is a fellow Canadian either as he really does understand and is able to give helpful advice. Thanks, Mike...you came to our rescue a few times and really made the difference during our stay!All in all, I would recommend the Majestic Colonial if you are going to Punta Cana. It is a great place...just keep in mind that you are in the Caribbean and things are done a little differently there. If you are OK with that, then you will love your stay there...and take a minute stop and say hello to Mike if you do go!

<Content>I would rather cruise I'm finally getting around to writing a review. My daughter, cousin, and I went to the Majestic to relax and enjoy the beach. I would advise knowing a little bit of Spanish, or, take a dictionary with you. The bed was very hard. We asked for extra pillows and towels upon arrival. The maid was outside of our room. I tipped her and had excellent service. The people of the Dominican are poor. A dollar goes a long way. Please, please tip the workers, even at an all-inclusive resort. The room was musty. We had a scented candle with us. Also, leaving the ceiling fan on all of the time, helps ALOT! The bathroom is strange, to say the least. Not much privacy. I didn't like that!  The bar downstairs from the main lobby makes the best drinks. Many people got sick during our stay. I think it's because they ate anything they saw. We never ate food that was outdoors. We were careful and stayed healthy. No goat stew for me. If I didn't know what it was, I didn't eat it. Drink bottled water. The mini-fridge in the room is well stocked. We took drinks to the beach. Many tourists are Spanish or Euorpean. The Euorpeans could be seen(some of them) walking topless on the beach. Didn't bother us. I would feel uncomfortable if my son were with me. The beach is very clean. The entire resort is clean and new.  All in all, it was a wonderful trip. However, I prefer a Caribbean cruise instead. Much more to do on a ship. I have gotten spoiled. I'm very happy I went to the Dominican. I always dreamed of going. I don't think I'll return though. There is alot of poverty. I feel sorry for the residents!

<Content>A Perfect Week in Paradise.. I travelled with my boyfriend to the Majestic in mid December and couldn't of had a better time... I relied so much on TripAdvisor when booking it, so here is my review:ARRIVAL - It is a short drive from the airport and reports of terrifying Dominican driving are highly exaggerated! Check-in was smooth, the staff were unbelievably nice. We never had any problems with the language, as most speak english quite well. Try and speak some spanish, though, its a beautiful language and fun to learn! ROOMS - Our room was breathtaking. I've stayed in numerous 5 stars including the Bahia and this was by far the nicest! A spacious room with gorgeous marble floors... The mattresses and pillows were fine, I don't know what people are complaining about!FOOD - The food was FANTASTIC!!! I am the worlds pickiest eater and found something at every meal that I not only ate, but LOVED! Try the french toast in the morning - yum! My boyfriend is a seafood fanatic and would not stop raving about the lobster at the seafood restaurant - (no reservations required) Delicious pasta bar and omellette stations were favourites of everyone we spoke to! I have no idea what more people could ask for! ENTERTAINMENT - Not bad. The Michael Jackson show was really fun, as was the ideal couple night - we we're made to participate in that so I should know! That's another thing, if you don't want to participate in the nightly show or activities, don't sit near the front! They will drag you on stage! The dance and circucs nights were, to be honest, a little amatuerish, but what they lacked they more than made up for in effort. These performers worked sooooo hard! It wasn't any better or worse at any other hotels.BEACH - AMAZING. White sand, clear water, lots of lounge chairs. I must tell you not be shocked at the amount of topless beach-goers. Many guests were European and it is perfectly acceptable to go topless. Didn't bother us at all. Something we really enjoyed and wish we'd done more than once was take a walk down the beach around 5p.m. and watch the sunset... Very serene and romantic! Also a good way to burn off that buffet!POOL - Huge pool, always a place to sit. The animation team sticks to one area, so if you want to read or snooze you can do so. We mainly stayed at the beach though.MEDICAL TREATMENT - Luckily, with the exception of a little tummy trouble, neither of us got sick from the food. I did however need to fill a prescription for something completly unrealted and there is a doctors office on site, open 24hrs a day, with a fluent, english speaking doctor. Wonderful service.TIPS - We tipped every night, although many didn't. We left $2 U.S for the maid and $2 on top of the fridge. Our room was always clean, and the fridge stocked to the brim. He started to notice what we were drinking more of, and put extra of it in. I don't know what the tipping standard is, but they seemed to appreciate it, as did the dinner servers. SHOPPING - There are vendors outside of the hotel and my godness do they try to rip you off!! The prices are reasonable when compared to the hotel gift shop, but they can be talked down if you are firm with them. Also, the vendors come and set up in the hotel on Thursday evenings.OVERALL - The most perfect trip I could have asked for. The staff were a joy, always greating you with a smile. The hotel was beautiful and had everything you could ever want. I would go back in a heartbeat!!!!!!

<Content>Majestic was fantastic Lynne and Stu Orr from Edmonton, AlbertaWe just returned from two weeks in Punta Cana, January 17 to January 31/07. The Majestic Colonial was one of the best resorts we have been at. We went with another couple and we had rooms 3120 and 3121 which is on the first floor that had a balconey's the accessed the pool. The room was beautiful, all marble, very large, pillows were fine, and the rooms were cleaned every day. We had no problem with bugs, never used our insect spray. Coffee was a little strong so we made Sanka from one of the bars and sat on our balconey every morning relaxing before breakfast.The pool is something to see. Biggest swimming pool we have ever seen. Very clean but bring a towel early in the moring to reserve a spot. We tried to cheat and left one over night but it dissappeared.The bar tenders are very friendly and the drinks they pour are usually three to four ounces of alcohol so be careful if you aren't used to strong drinks, but they can make them any way use want them. Food was excellent in all the restaurants and we tried them all. We had no trouble making reservations and liked the Japanese and the Mexican the best. Some of the bars didn't have premium type drinks available such as Corona which if they had it you would pay $3 US, but they had none. We had premium wrist bands meaning that we could order everything from the bar menus, however, my favorite scotch, Cutty Sark wasn't available, so had to subsitute with JB's or Red LabelThe beaches are fanastic. Some reviews I have read mentioned rocks. We are unsure were they were as we saw none and we walked virtually every day along the beach. The ocean water is like swimming in your bathtub. No much to see snorkelling wise in front of the hotel but there are excursions that cater to those so inclined. We also played golf at the Majestic golf course called Punta Blanca Golf Club. Best golf deal that we have ever experienced. Green fees are 30% off when you stay at the Majestic (regular price is $150) and comes with a cart, free beer and other beverages, and free food. The golf course itself is very forgiving and beautiful. Tee times are such that there was never anyone behind us nor anyone in front of us. Try and find that anywhere else. Green fees are $105 US. Club rentals (Calliway, Titlest, Taylor made) is $40 US. No shoe rentals, so bring them from home The other golf couses not affiliated with the Majestic are $150 US and up. We would go back in a heart beat. The grounds are absolutely beatuiful, the staff very friendly, and most speak english but are interested to teach you some Spanish if you show some interest in learning. We would recommend this resort to our friends andanyone else who asks. If you want you can contact me at: stewart.orr@shaw.ca We can home to a winter storm last night so I guess its back to reality. Damn!

<Content>First trip to MJ 13-17 Jan 40th Birthday for my wife with two other couples.US Air and Delta excellent ontime flights. Be aware if you travel on Delta and upgrade to First/Bus Class you get no food from Atlanta, drinks are available. The Punta Cana Airport is quite nice and functional. The transfers are well organized for all couples. Checkin was very quick and efficient, when a problem arose, the staff corrected it.The Hotel is very nice, the staff very, very friendly. As a matter of fact, the only people that do not say hello to each other are fellow tourist. Some of the bars had top shelf (at least for North Americans) liquor and it was never hard to get a drink. The Beach was fine, we did not spend a lot of time on the Beach due to fairly high winds. The pool is awesome, the hotel was almost full yet you could find plenty of room to yourself when in the pool. Matter of fact as we sent pictures out of us, everyone thought the resort was empty. Food was not all that good, about half of us liked our dishes at the a-la-cart rests. We agreeded the lunch buffet was very good plenty of choices and selection. We are kinda a food focused group, so we are probably tougher than others to please. I would argue with folks, that declare the food bad or less than good. I would also take exception to folks declaring the items we tried as exceptional. All and all, a great place and well worth the money. And as far as the beds, we loved them! I guess we like sleeping on rocks

<Content>Great time at the majestic My wife and I stayed at the majestic from 1/19 thru 1/26. This was our first time at an all-inclusive. We have cruised many times and felt like it was time to try something else for a change. we had a great time with a few minor issues.I鈥檒l try not to repeat previous reviewersPositives: the resort is beautiful (night+day) and well laid out. We liked the fact that everything was within walking distance. The dining and bar staff were very friendly and efficient (virtually no waiting). The bathrooms (suggetstion-install paper towel dispensers) and other common areas were clean.The beach is very nice and there are plenty of chairs at the pool and beach. We loved the relaxed atmosphere of the entire resort. The room was beautiful (especially the shower) and well laid out. The check-in and out was very efficient. The Punta Blanca golf course is next door and was a very nice lay out (will be above average once the course matures). Negatives: the room cleaning was poor,it seemed like all they did was empty the trash,make the bed,supply new towels and gave the sink and countertop a quick wipe-down. It would have been nice to get fresh sheets at least once during the week. Also extra towels would have been nice. The bed was pretty hard. We were on the first floor and the hallway was pretty noisey. If you like to sleep in,request 2nd or 3rd floor. None of this was not really a big deal with us but I think they should have more supervision in the housekeeping staff and try to make the beds softer (maybe egg crates on the mattress).Food: stay away from the beach buffet,the hot dogs and hamburgers are awful. The regular buffet had better food and was only a short walk away,well worth the walk. The Japanese,Chinese and Steakhouse were very good. The seafood restaurant was average. Did not care for the Mexican/Dominican restaurant,although many people liked it. The main buffet restaurant was pretty good (on the level of most cruise ships we have been on),can鈥檛 go wrong with the made to order food. One piece of advice-the Chinese was in the same dining room as the Japanese and did not require reservations.Casino: pretty small if gambling is your thing,I would go elsewhereBars: very nice,great service. My opinion- I think they should supply all of the bars with premium liquors and provide more than just Presidente beer on tap. Special thanks to the sports bar 鈥渢eam鈥?that us up for the NFC and AFC championship games,they really did a great job. Also thanks to our new friends from Edmonton who saved us seats.Like I stated earlier we had a great time at a beautiful resort and met a lot of nice people. We usually don鈥檛 go to the same place twice but we would definitely consider coming back to the majestic.

<Content>My Majestic Wedding Review As I promised here is my Majestic wedding review. I am going to try to answer all your questions throughout the review. If I forget anything let me know.When we arrived at the Majestic it was @ 2 am Sunday morning.( Our wedding was on the Tuesday at 5PM) We were immediately taken back by how beautiful the resort was. It took our breath away. Check in was a breeze and we all were assisted to our rooms quickly and efficiently. This was great. Rob and I were given an incredible suite. It was just fabulous. This was our second marriage so we had children and wanted to be in a room large enough for them as well but not have them directly under our noses. It was perfect. We were all in the same suite but in different rooms. Just perfect.We met Aurelio at 9.30 am the next morning. He was terrific. He sat with us and got to know us and listened to our wedding ideas. He ran with everything we threw at him. He was full of great suggestions and I instantly felt so reassured the wedding would be perfect. We chose our flowers from a catalogue, went over how I wanted the ceremony to play out, our dinner and reception, cake and details about our documentation. We covered everything while sipping on a lovely Majestic sunrise. YUMMMM.The next day I went to the spa located on the resort. I had a HUGE hair mishap here before I left Ontario and needed some real help. The stylist is very good. She colored my hair and we did see her style many heads during out trip. Bring her a picture and she will do it. She speaks NO English but there are plenty of English speaking staff at the spa to assist. No fear ladies she is a real professional and I saw many beautiful updo鈥檚 while there. All I needed was color so don鈥檛 judge her work by my pictures. My hair reacted poorly to the humidity and I attempted to do it myself.The day of the wedding I got ready in my room with my family etc. We waited for Aurelio to come and get us. He did鈥 couple of minutes late (the justice of the peace was running a little bit behind) but it just gave me some extra 鈥渢weaking鈥?time.The gazebo was decorated perfectly. Rose petals on the floor. I had made wedding fans that were displayed in a lovely wicker basket and they handed them out to all the guests as they arrived. All the chairs were covered in linen. We did purchase 2 small arrangements just for decoration. They looked great.I walked down the aisle. Many onlookers cheered (as they do for many weddings). It was in Spanish and translated by Majestic Mike himself. He was fantastic. He was calming and the ceremony was so tranquil and moving. Not a dry eye in the house. Mike did a great job.After the regular ceremony we had a sand ceremony which Aurelio had set up for me. I brought the sand and containers with me and he set it all up. I had one of my guests do the reading for it.Immediately following we made out way to the beach for many pictures. They were fun. This would have been @6- 6.30 and it was nicely cooled off and just getting dark. The pictures looked really neat as the sun went down.From there we went off to the steak house. (this was free because it was just one of the regular restaurants) I had name tags for everyone place at the tables. They set it up just as I wanted. A head table鈥?4 additional tables for our guests all surrounding a table in the center with our cake (which was the most delicious cake I had ever had).We were served steak and lobster and it was delicious. If you have guests that prefer something else then Aurelio gives you other choices the first morning you meet with him. We drank champagne, cut the cake and had a wonderful meal. (Cake wouldn鈥檛 feed 45 people so you may have to pay a little extra for a larger cake) It was right in the restaurant with the other guests but off on the corner for privacy. Perfect.From there we all returned to our room. We had a huge patio. Large enough for all of our 42 guests. We said some speeches and Rob and I had our first dance under the stars. It was better than I ever imagined. From there it was off to the disco for whomever was interested. Rob and I passed on the disco but most went and continued the party. (we have teenage children that wouldn鈥檛 miss the disco for anything!)This was it as far as the wedding itself went. It was better than I had ever dreamt it could be.I spoke in depth about the photographer in and earlier post so won鈥檛 go back into to much detail there.The resort;WOW! If you have ANY doubts about this resort please think again. We travel often and we have to say it was excellent. The food was great, weather, service, cleanliness, pool and beach were 100%. The resort was spotless. If you ever walked away hungry it was simply your own fault. There is a tremendous selection of food and I enjoyed everything I ate. The chateaubriand in the steak house was better than any I have eaten in Canada. Nobody in our group was sick.!!Aurelio,He works around the clock. He is running from morning until night. I heard he averages 200 emails daily. He really is running off his feet. You will love him. He is simply one of a kind. So helpful and thinks of everything. He really wants your day to be special and he makes sure it is. He was fabulous.Majestic Mike;Knowing Mike was in the resort was always reassuring. He answered so many questions for me. He gave us great direction and support. He was full of super advice and always willing to help out. Ladies, Mike has the most incredible eyes鈥?.check it out when you meet him鈥?you may get lost in them. Seriously Mike the Majestic wouldn鈥檛 have been the same without you. Thanks for all your help and patience with us excited travelers.In closing you can see we were completely satisfied. Please let me know if you have any questions.Take care.Becky

<Content>wonderful holiday we stayed at the Majestic from Jan. 5-12/07, what an awesome place! we would go back in a heartbeat. You find out little things as you go, but all in all a great place. The staff try very hard to please at all times, keep in mind that there may be a language barrier and it's their country and their language. The food was very good except at the buffet at supper time, we found that it was boring and not very hot. The Japanese restaurant requires a reservation as does the gourmet restaurant. We didn't know that there is a Chinese restaurant in the front of the Japanese restaurant that does not require a reservation until later in the week. All restaurants serve amazing food and the wait staff is VERY attentive. Shopping at the hotel is very expensive, for trinkets you just have to walk out to the end of the driveway or up the beach (longer to the right when looking at the water) to the market. They can drive you crazy, but remember to barter, never pay more than half of what they ask..1/3 sometimes works.the pool is absoletely amazing as are the rooms. We will be back, already dreaming! enjoy

<Content>Had A GREAT Time! Date: Jan 23,2007My family and I spent 6 days in Punta Cana Jan 11- 16. I was very happy with the resort and the staff. All were polite and friendly. Dispite what I read the room was clean, had plenty of towels and recieved extra pillows 5 min after a request for them. The refrigerator was stocked the whole time we were there. I think people have to remember you are not home, the beds will be different and the food. My family had no trouble finding something to eat at each meal. The restaurants were good, I recommend the Steak, French and Seafood in that order. We were unable to get a table at the japanese, it was booked. The resort itself was beautiful, pools were clean, beach was beautiful. Plenty of chairs at beach and pool.The room was very large and the only problem would be no place to change if you have children of the opposite sex.This was not a big issue for us.Overall, this was an enjoyable,relaxing vacation. I would recommend resort to friends and family and would go back myself.

<Content>Loved the Majestic!! My Husband and I just returned from the Majestic (Jan. 10-14) and since I relied on trip advisor so much in making my decision, I felt I should comment on our stay. Long I know - but hopefully helpful.First of all, we booked through Cheap Caribbean and would do so again. Everything was as they said, plus it was nice having a representative at the resort in case we needed anything. The reps were very helpful - not pushy at all. Our transport to and from the hotel was all taken care of and they told us where to be when for departure. ARRIVAL/CHECK-IN: Upon arrival we followed the crowd (very cute open air airport) and got our luggage right away. The weird thing was we paid $10 each for the tourist card, but then they collected it about 2 minutes later - when we asked our rep about it he said they do that sometimes - depends on the economy. We were prepared to purchase it again when we left- but never had too. Found our bus transport no problem and it took about 35 minutes to get to the hotel. They are doing a lot of road work trying to make the place easier to get around 鈥?but it was fine. When we arrived, a bellboy took our luggage and directed us to check in - easy process - then he took us to our room. He spoke very good English and showed us where things were along the way.  RESORT (general): It truly is majestic 鈥?the pictures don鈥檛 even do it justice. The grounds are well kept and the resort is so easy to get around 鈥?it runs lengthwise from the beach up the main lobby house. We loved the ease and simplicity of the resort and the open air feeling. There were bathhouses so you didn鈥檛 have to always go back to your room and they were always being cleaned. There were 4 outside bars and 2 bars in the lobby house 鈥?plenty of places to hang out and find a spot to chill - never felt overcrowded (and they were full). At night, everything was lit up - it was gorgeous along the walkways. The interior section of the room blocks were always lit up and the balcony lights went off every night at 11:00 (this is how we knew what time it was!) Never really had a problem with mosquitoes 鈥?could be the time of year though (I got eaten alive in Jamaica). Also, unlike other resorts, there was no one pushing timeshares or anything else down your throat.  As far as the fact that there were Europeans there - it didn't bother us a bit. It really felt like we were on vacation in another country. I hate to say it, but it was some of the other American guests who were the embarrassing ones. Not all Americans were this way, but it only takes one... AND let me also say - this is a Spanish speaking country and the fact that they even try to speak and put things in English was wonderful- we never had a problem. They appreciated every attempt we made at Spanish 鈥?they could tell we were learning, but trying. We had so much fun! Most of the time they would address us in English because we looked American - so I think any attempt to accommodate us like that was great. If someone didn't speak English, they found someone who did. So for those who complain about that - be nice and smile more or go on vacation in the states next time. SPA: We did use the spa and it was wonderful. Most people don鈥檛 realize that anyone can use the sauna, steam room, Vichy showers, and Jacuzzi pool they have in there. We both got massages and they were very relaxing. Prices are about the same as in the US. ROOM: Our room was in the perfect location as we asked to be close to the beach. It faced the pool area and I must say when the balcony door was closed, it was quiet in our room. Yes you could hear if people walked loudly outside the door, but any hotel I have ever stayed in was that way. The rooms were very spacious and nice. Room safe and remote included (some resorts cost$$). There are 鈥? blocks鈥?of rooms ( 1,000鈥檚 鈥?4,000鈥檚) and in some cases 3 or 4 stories. Any of the rooms would be fine except the 1,000 block faces another resort 鈥?so that might not be so good. Great water pressure and always had hot water. We tipped the maid at the end, but we always had fresh towels and a restocked bar. One thing is they don鈥檛 have washcloths 鈥?but the towels were nice and big. As far as the bottled water goes 鈥揼o to any bar and they will give you as many bottles as you want - it was never a problem. Also, they must have listened to people鈥檚 complaints (which says something) because the pillows were soft (had 2 extra in our closet) and there was a card to put outside your door to tell the maid to 鈥榗lean鈥?or 鈥榥ot to disturb鈥? It was usually cleaned while we were at the beach, so it worked out perfectly. SECURITY: You do get a wristband to wear - you can walk up and down the beach and this basically helps them know who is from where. AND speaking of that, there are security guards discreetly placed on the beach that would run-off anyone trying to sell things or enter our resort who didn't belong. We never once felt unsafe and I had no problem walking back to the room by myself. FOOD: The food was fine 鈥?many people again forget that these resorts cater to people other than Americans, so some of the food might seem odd. We ate breakfast every morning at the buffet 鈥?the pastries were awesome 鈥?fresh baked. They had a crepe station, fried egg and omelet station, and by the way if you like coffee 鈥?it was always available anytime day/night. You could also order cappuccino (yummy) and espresso. We ate lunch at the beach bar/grill because of the amazing beach view 鈥?yes, a lot of the same food, but it is lunch 鈥?what do you expect? Dinner was always great 鈥?we loved the Rodeo steakhouse (amazing Chateaubriand with b茅arnaise sauce) and Tres Carabelas (fish  seafood) because at night the beach grill was split into these two restaurants and the open air atmosphere was so nice. The French and Caribbean were also good (didn鈥檛 go to the Japanese place). Overall, we didn鈥檛 get sick and the food was fine 鈥?worked for us 鈥?we were there to relax, not gain 20 pounds. I think if you focus on the food and set high expectations, you will be disappointed at most all-inclusives. But for the value, we thought they had lots of variety and overall was good. We also brought a few munchies for at night just in case, but never needed them - we always got full at dinner! BAR: Let just say they have no problem pouring the drinks on the heavy liquor side! Freddie at the beach bar was great 鈥?his drinks were always good. Some of the bartenders had better personalities than others, but they would still get your drink. As I said before, a smile and patience goes a long way. We liked hanging out in the lobby house at night on the comfy couches - and they do have cocktail waitresses taking orders and cleaning up after people too - don鈥檛 normally see that at an all-inclusive. POOL: Amazing and so cool looking 鈥?runs the length of the hotel - never really used it as we are beach people, but it was very spacious and had quiet places you could hang out. BEACH: Awesome! We had some people from another resort stop to ask what the name of ours was because we had the best beach they had seen along their walk! Never had a problem getting chairs 鈥?people kind of cycled through. Each day we traded in our beach towels for new ones (there are 2 places to do this) 鈥?they always had plenty. ENTERTAINMENT: We are more of the quiet type, but did see the magic show one night (not bad) 鈥?the area where they had shows was nice 鈥?lots of chairs and tables and 2 bars. Even though we didn鈥檛 get to know the animation team, we could see them from our balcony and the energy they had would put most aerobic instructors in the US to shame! They always smiled and said 鈥淗ola鈥?and never hassled us about games, etc. We also didn鈥檛 sit near where they were 鈥?so there were areas close to the action and farther from it which was nice. EXCURSIONS: Didn鈥檛 do any this time 鈥?but will try next time.MONEY: We never had a problem as they were always willing to except cash 鈥?however bring ones, tens and fives because they can鈥檛 always make change on big bills. . We used our credit card at the spa no problem 鈥?they always showed us the conversions which are easy enough to do. In the airport, prices were in US dollars, but at the resort they were in pesos. We didn鈥檛 see the need to tip everyone either 鈥?and if you do, do it discreetly as they really don鈥檛 like to be seen taking tips. We did tip our favorite bartender at the beach bar, the bellboys, the maid (at the end of our stay) and our bus driver 鈥?and we never felt we got shafted in our service because we did or didn鈥檛 tip. Usually a big smile and a 鈥淕racias!鈥?made them happy.SMOKE: My husband and I are not smokers and my eyes and throat get irritated when I am around it 鈥?but due to the open airiness of the resort, it never really bothered me. Plus, the Europeans are very classy about how they smoke 鈥?not in your face like many Americans are (hence some of the rudeness we experienced). FINALLY: I think the real reason we liked this resort so much was because everyone was equal in the sense that there was no special block of rooms, concierge, special pool area that only certain privileged people could use or something you weren鈥檛 getting. Everyone there was on the same page and was made to feel special. That was what we loved the most. All the rooms are junior suites 鈥?sure there are a few that were beach front or a little different, but there wasn鈥檛 that feeling of your room block being so far away from everything else that maybe you weren鈥檛 really welcome there. Again, we liked the ease and simplicity of the resort. ALSO - I have to say that if you stop and watch all the employees for a minute, they were constantly buzzing around working hard - from the boys on the beach cleaning up trash, to the fact that my wine glass at dinner never went half empty 鈥?to when we had a quick downpour they would pull the giant shades down and start mopping everywhere - everyone there was awesome and made sure we were comfortable and happy. They can鈥檛 be perfect all the time and I am sure have good and bad days with service etc., but overall - WE LOVED the Majestic and will definitely return!Beachbums in PA

<Content>Falls short in important areas My review is based on placing The Majestic along side all of the resorts in the Caribbean that I have visited--this is not a How much fun did we have here review, it's a How Does the Majestic Stack up Against Area Resorts In General review. Our Stay: January 8-14, 2006. Room 3234.POSITIVES: The professional and candid photos of the resort really are a true reflection of the property. The main building, the grounds, and public areas overall are quite lovely. The thoughtful architectural design and physical layout ensures that nearly all rooms at the resort have a view of either the pool, the beach, or both. (There are a few very unfortunate exceptions where rooms face an ugly neighboring hotel building, access road and/or chain link security fence.) The beach is large, the pool is huge, and we had little problem finding chairs at either--it was particularly easy to locate chairs on the beach.The service and the staff who directly interact with guests (Animation team, bartenders, restaurant personnel) are very good. NEGATIVES: Despite the nice overall appearance of the rooms (marble floors, large walk-in shower, double vanities), the items that you actually need and/or use in the rooms are poor or nonexistent. Beds are hard as a rock--literally. Pillows are not actually pillows but thin half inch slices of non supportive foam (you need 4 or more to equal one 'normal' down pillow), You may or may not get towels. Our room, despite assurances that more would be sent (that never were) averaged 2 bath towels and one hand towel. For 2 adults, this is not adequate. Never a wash cloth, only twice in 6 nights did we have a bath mat (and the marble is way too slippery when wet to not have that), and twice our dirty towels were just not changed! (We had to use our pool towels.)Our bedspread was dirty throughout the stay, and on one day sheets were put on our bed that had lipstick all over the top of them! When the bed was turned down, there was no possible way that it could have been missed by maid service--but was left nonetheless.Fittings and room finishings are below par. We had a broken ceramic lamp in our room that the maid kept trying to rebalance on it's severed base--it fell over on my head the first night and we requested replacement--which never did arrive although the lamp was removed on the 4th day (they left the shade?!!). Cheap furniture is also already showing wear, slip covers are ill-fit and untidy, missing trim pieces were evident in the bathroom. FOOD and drinks: This is where the resort is most seriously lacking. If your idea of 'good' is akin to 'a lot', then you won't be disappointed with the food and drinks. HOWEVER, if what you want on vacation is fresh, local, interesting, tasty, well prepared, cuisine--GO ELSEWHERE. The quality of the food at the buffets is on par with hospital food and/or public cafeterias. The quality ranges from disgusting to below average at lunch time, average at breakfast, and below average at dinner. The most passable dinners we had were at the Rodeo Grill (steak) and the Japanese restaurant--where you are LUCKY to even get a reservation (we were told both reservation-only restaurants were totally booked during our entire when we attempted to make reservations UPON ARRIVAL). Neither is worth writing home about, but at least the food is average.Drinks  Wine: The wine is plentiful, but it is utterly horrid if you are truly a wine drinker. (And I don't mean 'wine snob', I mean if you like anything above a $4 bottle or box!) Premium brands of liquor are advertised but do not count on their availability. IN SUM: If you like a Spring Break type atmosphere, your goal is to 'par-tay!' and you don't care about food and drink quality--you'll have a good time. (I think I may have enjoyed a stay here when I was in my early 20s.)If you seek a relaxing, romantic, comfortable or pampering get away with good food  drinks, this is not the place. If Trip Advisor allowed, I'd give the Majestic 2.5.

<Content>Wonderful Service...Beautiful Location! My husband and I stayed at the Majestic from Dec 21 to 28, 2006. We were there to attend my cousin's wedding, which made this a unique experience. Below, a brief overview of our fantastic trip:FOOD: If your idea of a dream vacation is gourmet food and spectacular dining experiences, I would recommend against all-inclusives in general. All-inclusives tend to have a formula: breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets, a few specialty restaurants, and more casual eats near the beach. You will not go hungry, but you will rarely have a magical experience. Le Gourmet had a couple of very nice dishes (squash soup, veal), and the Rodeo Steak House surprised us with an amazing steak and fries. At Matsuri, we asked them to make a custom sushi roll (rolled in tempura batter and fried) which was fantastic!! Overall, the buffets were varied enough for a week's stay and fairly tasty. I was trying to be careful not to get sick, so I stuck to simple stuff and I was fine.ROOMS: I thought the room was beautiful! I agree with the reviews regarding the bathrooms being not private enough. I was there with my husband so it wasn't a problem, but if you are sharing a room with kids it could be tricky. Take advantage of the jacuzzi tub!! Beds were comfortable, air conditioning was perfect.POOL: I LOVED the pool. It was crystal clear and we didn't have a problem getting pool chairs up to about 1pm. The swim-up bar was great! Tip the bartender your first few times, ask him his name and get to know him, and pretty soon he'll be pouring you very generous drinks. Bring an insulated mug; you'll have to go back for refills less often and you'll keep the bugs out!BEACH: Beautiful beach! I love the fine white sand. The beach chairs get full pretty early. Personally I prefer the pool since I don't like a bikini full of sand at the end of the day, but the ocean water was warm. Waves can be a bit rough - keep an eye on non-swimmers.SNORKELING: We would not recommend going snorkeling with the company that operates at the Majestic beach. They would not give us a group rate for 12 people, their boat was 40 minutes late, and the boat captain was impatient and barely spoke English. They said they would take us to a site that was calm and good for beginners and that they would have a ladder for people to get back in the boat. Instead, we went to a choppy site, four people on our boat threw up, there was no ladder and people injured themselves being hauled back into the boat, and to top it off, the coral was all dead at the site they took us to. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.SERVICE: I was impressed with the service. Anytime we asked for anything (more towels, water, specially made meals, various wedding-related requests) they were more than happy to accomodate. Don't be afraid to ask for what you need, just PLEASE remember to be polite!! They really do work hard to make a living.DRINKS: This was my other area of disappointment. I am a wine drinker and was excited to order some wines with dinner, but they were sold out of almost all the specialty wines on their list. Their house red and white are TERRIBLE - undrinkable. I switched to liquor - many premium brands are available. The bartenders make some nice cocktails.OVERALL: Beautiful resort, gorgeous beach and pool, enough food, drink and entertainment to keep you happy. We would definitely go back!

<Content>Loved the Kids Club at the Majestic Colonial We stayed at the Majestic Colonial from Jan 12-19th, 2007. This was our 6th time to Punta Cana in 3 years. We love it there! This was the 5th resort that we have stayed at in the DR so we have been around the block down there. =) The first thing I want to talk about is the kids club. It was FANTASTIC. The two awesome ladies that won over the heart of my daughter were Maria and Chocolate. Zo毛 had SO much fun there, we had to bribe her to hang out with us at the beach or the pool. Every day she would go there after breakfast through the evening time. They would take all the kids to lunch at the steak house lunch buffet, and we would meet them there so we could eat together. The kids club had a castle with two water slides that went into the kids sized pool. It was not too deep, just perfect for the kids. My daughter is 6 ( I thought I would mention so you can judge for your kids). The kids club closed at 6 each night. Each night at 8:30 they had a Mini Disco on the stage where Maria  Chocolate danced and played games with the kids. The food was good. Our room was close to the lobby, and my parents was near the beach, so we had the best of both worlds. The rooms are great. They are an open floor plan, with the shower and toilet behind frosted glass doors. In between the bedroom area and the bathroom is the Jacuzzi tub. That was GREAT. We loved it. We put some of the bath gel in, and we had some great bubbles! The night shows were fun. My daughter always loves the Michael Jackson show. We saw a few others and they were pretty funny. They involve the audience, and that can be really funny. My dad had to use the Medical office as he was a little under the weather when we arrived. The Dr was very good - he got him up and running very quickly. The bill was not too bad either. They did run out of towels once while we were there, but it was not that big of a deal, we just went back and got them when they had them. It was only 1x in the 8 days we were there. The pillows were pretty bad, but if you ask for more, they bring them very quickly as they did with anything else that we asked for. The service in this resort was quicker than any we had stayed in. The one problem we almost had, was that they were completely booked up in the Japanese restaurant for the whole week. We ended up talking to a manager and got a reservation, but was disappointed about that. They said that the resort was 100% full due to so may weddings etc so I can see how that might happen, since they only have two hibachis in the Japanese restaurant. They need more of them for user. Overall we had a FANTASTIC time. No complaints.

<Content>Great vacation, Great resort! We just returned from the Majestic Colonial on Friday morning after a week's stay, and I am wishing that we were still there. This was our third trip to Punta Cana, and as always, we had a great time; the Dominican is one of our favourite places to travel to. My husband and I traveled with a group of 8 others, all of who had never traveled to the Dominican before. Since my husband and I have traveled to Punta Cana in the past (Barcelo Beach and Melia Caribe), we were looking for a resort that would service the needs of all the individuals traveling with us. Overall, this was a great resort. We have traveled not only in the Dominican, but in Mexico as well, and I would rate this resort as one of the top resorts we have stayed at. When traveling, I always try to keep in mind that there's no perfect resort out there; there's always going to be things that you like an don't like, but it's the overall experience you have that matters.We arrived at the Majestic around 10:00 in the evening, and we were the only one's at the check-in desk when we arrived. Prior to traveling I had made room requests through our travel agent, as well, I had emailed the resort a week before arriving to confirm our room requests. Of the 5 rooms we booked, 3 of the rooms met (or partially) met the room requests we made. I noticed that my husband and I had been put in a room on the 1st floor of block 1000, which I immediately asked to be changed - we had requested a room in the 3000 or 4000 block on the 2nd or 3rd floor with a king-sized bed. I was told that nothing else was available, and to come back the next morning to request a change. After being persistent, they finally took the time to check if another room was available, however, again I was told to come back the next morning. The result; room 1142 - a room with 2 double beds that overlooked the restaurant of the resort next door. Not very romantic, but how much time do you really spend in your room? That being said, my sister and her best friend were put in a room with a king-sized bed in Block 3000 that overlooked the pool - I question why they put a husband and wife in a room with two double beds, and then put two girls who requested two double beds in a room with a king-sized bed? It doesn't make a lot of sense, and when we questioned it, we were completely ignored. I think that this resort has a lot of work to do when it comes to their services at the front desk, and this is my biggest complaint of the service we received during our stay.We also had problems with the front-desk on the day we checked out. As we didn't fly out until late in the evening, my husband had asked for an extended check-out time (we were told by our Air Transat rep to do this, and that it shouldn't be a problem to do so). He was immediately told no by the individual he had talked to, however, after going back to the front-desk a second time and talking to a different individual, he was told that it would be no problem at all. In general, we got the impression that the front-desk doesn't really care about what kind of service it offers to it customers, and that they just fall back on the excuse that they're at 100% capacity all of the time. This is definitely not the service I would expect from a 5-star resort.The rooms, in general are very nice. We booked a standard garden-view room and it has everything you would expect from a 5-star resort room - large room, bar fridge stocked daily, etc. The open bathroom concept didn't bother us, however, I can see where it would be a problem for families or non-couples. As mentioned in previous reviews, the construction of the rooms (and in that matter, the resort itself) was done in a very shoddy manner (it appears as though they tried to put the resort together too quickly and that the specifics were overlooked). Although this didn't bother us, I heard others complain about it while were were there, and if you are one of those people who likes perfection, this may not be a resort for you.The beach was also nice, however, the other resorts we stayed at on Bavaro Beach kept better care of their beaches - we found that although they cleaned up the seaweed, etc. on the beach daily, there still seemed to be a lot of straws and cigarette butts lying around. At both the Melia and Barcelo they cleared the chairs on the beach every morning and raked it thoroughly. Bavaro Beach is one of the nicest beaches in the world, and I would suggest that everyone at some point in time in their life take the time to visit Punta Cana to see it.The pool was also very nice, however, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, there is some work they need to do to the sidewalks and decks of the pool area - some of the concrete areas around the pool is breaking up and needs to be worked on (sooner than later). The pool was colder than the ocean, so we tended to spend more time swimming in the ocean that we did in the pool.The food and service at the restaurants throughout the resort was outstanding - some of the best food and service we have received. If you can't find someting to eat at this resort, then an all-inclusive is not for you. We tried all the restaurants on the resort at least once, and all were fabulous in their own way - no complaints at all.Overall, this is a wonderful and beautiful resort. As it is a new resort, the foliage still has a lot of maturing to do, however, it is still a very beautiful resort, and in a couple of years I can only imagine how magnificant it will be. If you enjoy smaller resorts, then this would be a perfect resort for you - it's very easy to walk from the beach to the lobby, and vice versa. We have typically stayed in larger resorts, however, enjoyed being able to get around quite quickly without having to rely on a tram to get us from one point to another.Overall, I would rate this resort a strong 4 / 4 1/2 out of 5. There are some small things that need to be done by a resort to give it a 5-star rating, and this resort falls short of that. With a little attention to detail, however, I'm sure they could achieve this.

<Content>Time Of My Life From reading all the reveiws from this resort before leaving to go we were very excited. This hotel has everything you need and want. The room was great and the beds comfortable. Staff are extremley helpful and are always trying to help you wiht your spanish. The drinks were non stop and the pool and ocean never better. I have had bad trips and we went here with 14 other people for a wedding and there was not one complaint from the group. the only complaint i have is some of the guests that were there that maybe did not realize that they are not in there own country anymore and if Great isn't good enough then maybe they should have spent more money to get better. Also the market people are extremly pushy and at times rude when you do not buy from them but this has nothing to do with the hotel. Definatley will be returning in the years to come.

<Content>A great week at the Majestic Majestic Punt Cana6 to 13 Jan 07Hola to the many friends we met among the staff at the Majestic. The staff at both the bar and the food areas were great. Their English was as good as my Spanish, but we got along. The maid service was very poor. A $1 tip on the side of the tub helped a bit but the place did not look like it had been dusted in quite a while. The resort is great and I love the pool. We never felt crowded. The one thing I question is the washroom layout. Even traveling with my wife there are times you want some privacy. I wonder how a women traveling with two per teenage sons would make out. The food at the buffet was cold and not very tasty. They have several cooks working different areas. You can have one of the cooks whip up an omelet or something for you. Then it will be hot. The heating lamps just don鈥檛 do it.The Restaurants are something else. This is the first time in the Caribbean where I have had an eatable stake. If you want a delicious meal any where in the Caribbean order from their sea food menu. The Majestic lives up to my expectations. The seafood is a must do for your evening meal. In the evening there is a show at the theater. The seating is so comfortable it will put you to sleep, only to be awaken by the mosquitoes. Take your favorite bug repellent and leave it to the entertainers to keep you awake.. We had a great week at the Majestic. I would go back

<Content>Looks nice......but be very aware I booked a week vacation for myself and my girlfriend and the plan was the propose on the beach. I had done a lot of research on resorts in Punta Cana, and based on reviews of other tripadvisor members chose the Majestic. What a mistake!Upon arrival we were put into the wrong room on purpose to see if we would complain. I had paid extra for a colonial suite and when we went to complain about our garden suite, they just happened to have a colonial suite available, no questions asked. Did not make sense!Overall the hotel grounds are very lush and green. The pool is nice and the beach, although rough is also very nice. The rooms are not 5 star rooms by any means. Lots of leaks from the cieling. When it would rain, our room would be drenched with water and it took 2 days for it to be fixed. And when it was fixed it was fixed at 11:15 at night. Not very conveninent.As for the food, not good at all. We have been to other all inclusives in Mexico and Cuba, and the Majestic's food was by far the worst. Vacations are not enjoyable when you have to worry about what to eat. My girlfriend got very sick and actually passed out because she was so dehydrated. Staff was helpful, even though they charged $175 for Pepto Bismol to calm her stomach.Beach and pool were the one bright spot of the trip. Proposed at sun set on the beach and she said yes! Some of the nicest beaches I have ever seen, however sometimes can get very windy.Staff and service. Terrible. Even if you tipped, it seemed as the bartenders were doing you a favor.Now probably after reading this you might chalk it up to this guy had a bad experience, as I would probably have, however if you have been to any other all inclusive especially in the Mayan, you will be thoroughly dissappointed, and I would recommend saving your time and money!Hope this helps! Have a great day!

<Content>fantastic majestic went down on mon jan 8 - 15 . the food was fantastic , we had a group of 18 people and no one got sick . some people got sick but it was self - inflicted . warning - they pour some stiff drinks down there !!!the entertainment was awsome . we got married and it was quick and painless which was great cuz the heat can be too much especially for a bride in a gown .the resort was a class act from a to z . the only bad thing was one idiot who called himself dr love . this guy was out of control. he was so drunk all the time and during the stage shows he was a complete idiot . he broke our camera with his wild micheal jackson dancing he jumped on top of my wife and my sister- in law and some other poor woman during the stage show he caused injuries to two of the women . then he went out in the audience and tried to rip the shirt off an 18 year old girl.his wife or girlfriend should keep this guy in line but she is probably in the same class bracket . only a stint in a dominican jail kept this guy from getting free dental work.two of the people he stayed with have never been so embarased in their lives they said they dont know him and that he came with a friend . this guy was in the same shape every night . if you read this my friend - get help - you are not funny - go to AA or something . the only good thing i can say is that after several reports to the resort i hope they blackball you and refuse your next reservation and spare some others from your obnoxious , rude unbelievable behavior

<Content>A veneer of Excellence We stayed at the Majestic because it had been chosen by friends for their wedding. We stayed for 14 nights. If you a planning a wedding then I would recommend the Majestic, as they did a superb job. Just be aware that it rains repeatedly each day !This was our first all inclusive holiday and I am pretty sure that this is the best hotel in the Dominican Republic. But, if you are expecting 5 Star standards then think again.The hotel is very new but the standard of finish is dreadful. At first glance the hotel looks stunning , but it has been built very shoddily and within a couple of years unless they spend a lot on maintenance it will be come very tatty. There is a very long driveway up to the Resort, but if you walk down it you will see that they haven't quite finished the building work ( piles of rubble which haven't been removed or landscaped over). In many places they mixed concrete on the tarmac and never washed down afterwards so you see white patches. All over the hotel the concrete walkways are breaking up, and this is uncomfortable in the pool side areas when you aren't wearing shoes. The paths and pools areas have what could be be nice attractive inlaid bricks, but these are partly concreted over or have fallen out and this really spoils the appearance.In the bedrooms and public toilet areas the standard of tiling is a joke. They could never have used professional tilers as the standard of workmanship is awful. In many of the public toilets the flush mechanisms were broken.There was a lift outside our room and it never worked all the time we were there. I reported 2 faulty lights in my room but they were never repaired. I reported the coffee maker faulty but it was not replaced.Fortunately there is a a very good Doctor on site 24 hours. My wife caught Gastroenteritis and spent 2 nights in hospital, many people in our party experienced upset tummies.They do try to make the grounds look attractive, everywhere you see gardeners hard at work. The restaurants have a wide variety of menus, but there is little variation and it is possible that you would tire of the same food each day. The same food appears time and time again in different restaurants. The service is excellent.The bar and entertainment staff are first class and work very long hours ( always a smile ).The beach is stunning and is kept very clean. There is very good security minding the beach.I would recommend the hotel for breaks up to 7 nights, but you could become bored in the second week as the entertainment repeats weekly.

<Content>Totally Enjoyed It My family of 4 went to the Majestic from Dec 30 to Jan 6 for our Christmas break. This resort is wonderful, clean and the staff who have the warmest smiles will bend over backwards for you.Food: The main buffet is good with lots of choices. I 've been to many resorts and not to eat the pasta bar every night means the food was great for me, seeing I only had it one night. Breakfast was nice, loved the fresh fruit. If you didnt see a something you wanted already cut, the man would cut something up for you. Another nice treat was the champange and orange juice mimosa each and every day.We had lunch mainly at the main buffet, loved the pizza and nachos with salsa! A few times we at the beach front buffet. It was ok not as much choices but if you want a burger or hot dog its fine. I did like making a special drink there using coconut ice cream. I'd get them to put it in the blender with ice and rum. A great afternoon treat! We went to all the a- la carte resturants which were a nice change from the buffet. My sister is a vegatarian and was thrilled with the seafood resturant as she had wonderful lobster. After the first plate they asked if anyone wanted another so a second plate of lobster came. My faviorte was the Japanese. The atmosherpe was fun sitting around the tables while the food was prepared. If you have troubles getting a reservation what we did was went down at 630pm and waited to see if anyone cancelled or not show up because if they dont come with in 10 minutes of their reservation they will give it to someone else! LeGormet was nice, service there was top notch. If our wine was half empty it would be filled imediately. The wine at this resort is quite good being at other resorts with the wine coming out of a barrel, the wine here is in bottles and is nice. Rooms: First we were amazed that there was a bottle of champage there for us.The room was very spacious. My parents had a king size and my sister and I had two doubles. There was a bit of musky smell when we first arrived but we turned on the fan and kept the air at 20 and its seemed to to the trick. The shower are was huge probably 5 people could stand in there eaisly. We would leave our maid small gifts each day. Bars: We spent alot of time at night at the lobby bar with Juan. This staff member was by far the nicest and hard working man. He enjoyed chatting with us and others who sat at his bar. He took alot of pride in his work and kept his bar very very clean. Stop by and see him he makes a great ceasar and apple martini.The swim up bar is nice but depending were you sit durning the day it can be a bit of a swim to get there. There are many spots to stop along the way through out the resort to get a drink.Nightly Shows: The shows are well done, at times a bit repeatative but still nice to see after dinner. The Michael Jackson show was great. Lots of music and dancing. We were there for New Years Eve and they had fireworks, gave everyone party favors and champange for the count down. Disco: We had good nights dancing away at the disco. I do suggest taking a few dollar there as the first night we were there the service was a bit slow as the bartenders seem to tend to people who did have dollars to give. The entertainment staff will be there and love to get people up and dancing, its great. My sister is 24 and am 27 and were happy to see it wasnt just young teenagers and we even got my Dad there one night.Beach: The beach was really beautiful. I cant say I went in the water past my knees but it was warm. Pool: We spent each day at the pool. It was relaxing and if you didnt want to be right in the mix of things with the entertainment staff the pool is big with lots of space to choose from. It was very clean and a nice tempurature to swim in, espcially when the sun was shinning and you were nice and hot. We had a great week here and I would love to go back. It was great for all ages . Finally a vaction is what you make of it and remembering your not at the Hilton like at home. Happy travelling.

<Content>not my favorite hotel Recently got back from a 7 night stay at the Majestic and felt compelled to write a review, something I've never done before. The quick summary is that this was not a hotel I would ever go back to. First, however, let me start with the positives. The grounds were very nice. The pool was very large and quite pleasant, and the beach was nice as well. The rooms were very spacious and were nice as well (except for the bathroom).  That being said, when we got to the hotel, they didn't have the type of room we had reserved. Rather than a room with a king bed, they had a room with 2 full size beds. The room issue did get fixed for the second night. But, I happened to be up at the front desk several times during the stay, and each time saw at least 3-4 people complaining about their room and being told to check back the following day to see if there was a different room available. At least some of these people that we subsequently spoke to were not able to get their room changed. The hotel was also very stingy with towels, both in the rooms and for the pool/beach. The toilet in the room was literally set up as a tiny stall; if you're claustrophobic or if you're a large person, you'll have a problem with this. The pillows were terrible as well. Luckily, I saw a review on Tripadvisor before my trip, and had my own pillows with me, so this wasn't a real issue for me. Now for the biggest shortcoming of the hotel: the food. Let me preface this by saying that I am not someone who demands gourmet food, and I am usually not difficult to satisfy. Breakfast was average. Nice selection of fruit, different types of eggs, cereal, pancakes, french toast (actually was closer to regular toast), etc... Nothing to complain about, but also nothing to brag about. Lunch, unfortunately was the exact same options every day. Much of it was from the previous night's dinner. It wasn't so good the night before, so repeating it for lunch was not very appetizing. The dinner at the buffet was the same every night as well, and the specialty restaurants were not very good either. My wife and I got so sick of the food that we decided to go home a night early, even knowing we probably couldn't get a refund for the last night.

<Content>This hotel is second to none! Firstly, DO NOT be swayed by the few people who complained about this hotel...if you take the time to read their complaints, they are petty, and most complain about their VACATION( ie, excursions, bartering, the airport,what the bus ride was like, etc). All of these items have nothing to do with Majestic Colonial ~ so its unfair to rate a hotel based on these issues!I can't say enough about the Majestic, its staff and the facilities it offers! We stayed for one week Jan. 4, and wished we were still there! The road-side entrance of the Hotel is not too inviting but don't dismay, once you arrive at the main hotel lobby, you forget all that you saw. The hotel staff make you feel instantly welcome, as bell-boys grab you luggage for you and you are directed to the check in area. The Front desk staff all speak English very well, and will check you in while a waitress bring you a nice cocktail to welcome you! All of your questions are answered and your uggage follows you to your room. The walk from the main lobby to your room can be long, depending where you are situated on the property, but when the hot sun hits you, who cares?The rooms are HUGE! As they are all suites, I think it was almost 600sqft in size (average hotel room is 375sqft), and is very nicely decorated with all up to date amenities including hairdryer, iron/board, jacuzzi tub, separate shower(could fit 4 people!), stocked mini-bar (water, pop and beer), oversized balcony with chairs and table, satellite TV. The electicity is the same as Canada, so no plugs are necessary. The pillows are not good,and the matress is firm, but at the end of the day, it still felt good to get a decent nights sleep. A/C is strong, and we didn't notice a musty smell at all. We left the houskeeping staff $2/day, and the bar re-stocker $1/day (got extra water  beer!).The pool is huge, and you can always find a lounger, although we did get annoyed by some people who would put their towel on the best loungers, fold down the back of it and leave it for whenever they felt like coming back to the pool, some HOURS later. Many a time I felt like removing their towel and act confused when they return! HA HA! Bar service is excellent, prompt and although I don't think the staff expect it, even a dollar to them every couple of drinks means the world to them. The Beach area is where we spent most of our time-fine white sand, aqua-coloured water, and lots of sun. It did rain almost every day, but it lasts for about 5 minutes, then blue skies again! There are salespeople on the beach trying to sell you excursion packages or bead your hair...they respect you if you don't make eye contact and won't approach you. When you say no thanks!, they thank you and move on. Believe me, they approached us twice in one week, and that's it-they are polite and are not pushy.The waves did get quite big on 2 occasions, but when you're dealing with the ocean, you have to expect it -water was clean, refreshing and A1!Our meals were excellent! Buffets provide everything for anyone, but they are still buffets-you do get a wide variety of options, breakfasts were very well done. Lunch gave you a couple of options, either buffet or you could eat at the Beach restaurant which served food all day-salads, pasta, burgers, hot dogs, calamari, paella, desserts all up to 3pm, but would extend it if there were losts of people eating late! Your options for Dinners are wide - every night we ate somewhere different! Buffet, Seafood, Rodeo Grill, Caribbean featuring authentic Dominican food, Le Gourmet(reservatoins needed), Maiko-Japanese cooked before your eyes(reservations needed), and the regular Japanese restaurant. All of the meals were done very well, and are worth trying! I didn't have high expections for the food, but walked away pleasently surprised and full! The staff at all of the restaurants are truly OUTSTANDING! They all move as quickly as possible to serve you- my drink was never empty, a dirty plate was wisked away within minutes, inquiries about how our service/meal has been, but not in any way did I feel rushed to throw back my meal to make room for the next guest. My hat goes off to the staff, and leaving a couple of dollars is purly at your discretion for outstanding service!Speaking of staff, we encountered no staff who left us with a negative feeling-all were friendly, approachable and eager to serve you and make you feel like a million dollars! They will speak to you in Spanish first, but most have some English skills, and between my poor Spanish and their poor English, we made it work! My advice is to try to learn a few things in Spanish~after all, we are in their country, and by making an effort shows them some respect. Everywhere we went on the property, we were greeted with a smile, be it the gardeners, the maid, the washroom attendant or the guys who cleaned the beach daily. These people work damn hard, and always have a smile-a tough thing to do! The Animation team - a group of individuals who try to get you involved in daytime activities, for some fun by poolside. If you don't want to participate, they will leave you alone, but they have the energy of 10 men! They keep you entertained during the day and usually have something to do with the evening shows, which were pretty good considering they probably operate on a small budget. Don't expect a Las Vegas show, and you will have fun!Overall, the Majestic exceeded our expectations and I would recommend this property to anyone, maybe not singles, but couples families defintely! You are in a third world country, so don't expect the country to have all the things we take for granted. On the bus ride to the hotel, you will find that the roads are awful, people live in shacks, some have no shoes, and seeing shopkeepers and guards on business properties with guns is not uncommon. All of the Hotels have fences surrounding their properties to keep locals out, and do have security staff. Other than those things, we didn't venture off the hotel property, but did walk along the beach daily (as does everyone else), with no problems or concerns for safety.I will be visit the Dominican again and will stay no-where else other than the Majestic Colonial!

<Content>Super Place!!! The Majestic was truly a great place to stay....we have stayed in the Punta Cana area 3 years ago and have some comparisons to make. We were at the Majestic for 2 weeks - Dec 16th - 30th. The staff was not as friendly as our other hotel. It would be great if they at least acted like they knew us and greeted us as though they were happy to see us. My husband and I had breakfast and lunch at the same restaurants daily. We felt the same way at the bars...but not the bar in the lobby - he was fantastic! We felt like we were infringing on their space. We had also booked a reservation at the French restaurant one evening for 9:30. We arrived at 9:20 and were turned away, despite the restaurant being half full. We just stood outside for 10 minutes and then went back in...however, a little perturbed.I think those would be our only complaints...The food was fantastic...and I see a few people complained about getting sick...you may get the runs as your body adjusts to the new food and atmosphere but there's nothing wrong with the food. The beds are a little harder - we enjoyed that as we both suffer from back pain and it was a beautiful sleep. I also read here that the pillows were a bit off, again we did not find that at all....pillows are great. The beach area was fantastic...very choppy waters when we were there...we thought that was fun - jumping around and getting alot of exercise! Tons to do with the staff!!! If you don't like this vacation - it's because you think of 5 star at the Hilton! Rooms were spacious and clean. The musty smell was there, but you got used to it as you stayed...what can we expect with 90% humidity?

<Content>Don't expect too much The Majestic Colonial is an average all-inclusive. Having stayed at a number of other all inclusives on other islands, it appears that, at least at this resort, the DR needs to do some catching up. We paid for an ocean front room which was lovely (after we went back to the front desk and demanded what we had paid for), spacious, clean and with a personal jaguzzi. While the beach was lovely, the high winds never stopped during our entire trip, making walks on the beach tiring and painful (sand hitting you constantly). There were plenty of lounges because everyone seemed to be at the more sheltered pools, where lounges were at a premium. The water was incredibly rough with whitecaps and rollers inside the breakwater.Food was acceptable to poor, depending what and where you ate. Everything was cold, unless you had it prepared at one of the chef stations.They seem to do fish well and the French restaurant was good. The buffet was the same every breakfast, lunch and dinner. The bars had no snacks, what few hor d'ouvres they put out in one spot in the evening were inedible.Glad we were only there for 5 days, a week would have been way too much.

<Content>You need to consider the food before going We are a 28 year old couple from Boston, stayed at the Majestic for one week in December. Before making your decision to go to this resort, you need to be aware of how bad the food is. I didn't listen to the reviews about the food before I left because it was a very affordable price for such a beautiful resort and beach. The buffets are big, so one would think you could find something, but it's all awful. I tried everything. I never got sick, most people I met there didn't, but it's hard to eat cafeteria grade food all day long when the rest of you is in luxurious resort mode.I tried to not let this bring me down on my vacation, but I would have given anything to have known, I would have brought snacks in my luggage. Even a loaf of bread, for a PBJ would have tasted fantastic. The only restaurant that was good was the japanese, but you can only go there once. The food at the french restaurant is a disaster.That being said, I wouldn't go to another all inclusive. I met a woman on vacation who had been to 11 other all inclusives. She said the food doesn't get any better than this. If they only had a grill on the beach with real meat hamburgers and hotdogs, I would probably go back.The resort and beach are both amazing. Just like the pictures. I had an hour massage on the beach in a palapa hut. It was the best massage I've ever had. Definately worth the 70.00. The rooms themselves are above and beyond. They could easily pass for the Ritz or Four Seasons.If you get a room without a pool view. Don't be dissapointed. The pool is very loud, It was nice to get away from all the noise. The beach is great for long walks. There are hundreds of palapas and you never have a problem finding comfy chairs. For the women, don't forget to pack some summer dresses. At night, most people dress up.

<Content>Liked It But Not As Good As Sunscape The Beach We stayed at the Majestic Colonial from December 16-23, 2006. It was our second time to Punta Cana. We stayed a year ago at Sunscape The Beach. We booked this trip last minute and based somewhat on the reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel property was nice. The hotel requires wristbands that must be worn. The towels require a card. You are only allowed one towel per person. There are reservations required at the French and Japanese restaurants. We found the buffet food to be only fair. It was the same food daily. The Japanese and Chinese restaurant was good. We tried to ask for lobster with our steak in the Steakhouse but were advised it was not allowed. The bars around the pool do not use blenders. They have crushed ice that are shovelled into glasses. The kids club was okay. The children played video games most of the day. The girls working at the kids club were very friendly. They assisted as much as possible. The shows were fine. We watched part of the Michael Jackson show and the trampoline show. There were several nights of interactive participation shows. The bars at night in the lobby had good drinks. The would make expresso and blended drinks. The main buffet restaurant closes at 10:30 am. We advised it was a bit early when we showed up and it was closed. The maid service was fair. We noticed that the bathtub was not cleaned daily. The mini bar was fully stocked. The room has a safe. There is internet access in the lobby. The stores on the complex were expensive. The entertainment staff were fun. There were many activities and games. The pool was huge. During our stay the spa was closed for repairs. The ponds on the premises were drained several times after a thunderstorm. We met several people from around the world. We had stayed previously at Sunscape The Beach and found it much better. STB had free towels, did not require reservations, had not wristbands, had nicer rooms and had friendlier staff. We would go back to Punta Cana but likely try another hotel or go back to STB.

<Content>Best vacation so far! We have just returned from a 2 week vacation at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. Fourteen of us went my whole family and we had a wonderful time. Rooms were great! Food was great, the Japanese was great food and entertainment Henry and cooks were Excellentay! The pool was fabulous and the entertainment crew were alot of fun and very helpful! We enjoyed Tyson , Pablo, Julio,Jesus, Sandy, Samuel and the rest of the gang. OUr pool bar waitress Bianca was fantastic and so were all the bartenders. Every night there was a great zacsaphone player he was great. The beaches are the best anywhere you can walk for 28 kilometers if you wish. A holiday is what you make it the dominican people are very charming and always willing to make your stay a great one. We will back asap. Enjoy any questions my e-mail is kmhogg@shaw.ca

<Content>Great Time by Whole Family I will try to keep this short and sweet...We stayed at the Majestic Dec 28 through Jan 4. Majestic Mike was in the loby ready to great everyone coming in and it was a pleasure meeting him.Food- Overall it was good. Keeping in mind that we were in a different country I was not very fond of the hamburgers at the Beach resturant. The buffet always had a great selection and on New Years Eve they put out the most amazing spread I have ever seen. Hats off to the Chefs. They had a huge tree with lobster tails of all sizes and everything else you could possibly think of. I was truly impressed. I must say I fell in love with the homemade tortilla chips. I am now working out on my exercise bike.Service - From the bartenders to the maids, resturant help and front desk everyone was always pleasant. Our maid even stopped us in the hallway to thank us for the money we left her every morning. I made up envelopes printed on the front with sayings like...The service is great. Thank you etc. for each day and put $2.00 in it for her. Somedays, like New Years Eve I left small gifts along with it. They truly work hard and deserve to be recognized. The lobby bar is where we hung after dinner and was always greeted by the bartenders.Rooms - Breathtaking....We had room 2349 and I think it was the best of the hotel. It was a Colonial Ocean View which overlooked the ocean and pool. It was the end unit and the balcony was huge. I even had a lady from Canada come up to me at the pool and ask me just how big it was. It seems she saw me up there and said it seemed like I was walking forever to get back to the room. We were upgraded to this when we arrived without even asking. We did have an Ocean View reserved but the upgrade was to a Colonial. The hot tub on the balcony we used once. It took long to fill and quite frankly it was like a jet bathtub outside.For those worried about the open concept. I don't think it is much to worry about. My 3 boys did have their own room but often came up to ours before dinner just as I was showering. I would just put the towel on in the shower (towel shelf right in the shower it is that big) come out and then get my clothes and go in the closed door bathroom. No big deal at all.Excersions - We went snorkling with the sharks and sting rays with the Marinarium Marine Park  Aquarium tour. It was a half day and what a blast. Mr. Sharkey was the best and kept everyone dancing and mixing drinks on the boat. Very professional. It seems that each tour group has their own tours they recommend. We also did the jeep safari all day tour. Here we went to the sugar cane fields, school house, Dominican home, lunch at beach and horse back riding on a beach. Great day. Please bring something to hand out to the children. They do run after your jeep especially in the sugar cane fields and look for candy or money. I brought bags of fruit snacks and a bunch of extra change to hand out (most kids are in the sugar cane fields but save some for on the way to the beach lunch). They are adorable and are very thankful. We also went to a cigar factory which was an interesting and informative tour. It was free. They pick you up at the hotel and bring you back. The cigars at the hotel were a bit expensive but this tour had them for much less (my husband is a cigar lover, we have a built in humador in our home so he spend $300.00 on cigars). I got even at the Harrison Jewlrey store!Overall - So without boaring you, the weather was great....oh yea, the anamation team was non-stop can't forget them. It seems like they never stop. They are at the pool, around the bar at nights talking to people, at the shows and at the disco. Do you guys ever sleep? I must say I loved Sugar Ray.....always smiling and remembers your name! Now, Back to the ending, great weather, beautiful hotel and memories. Thank you to everyone at the Majestic for making our holidays so special and one we will never forget! Until next time.......

<Content>I would return Went to the Majestic Colonial for our honeymoon in January 2006. We had an incredible time and really enjoyed the hotel. Some work on the grounds was still being completed during our stay but it did not affect us one bit. This hotel has an absolutely incredible pool. If you would rather lounge on the beach then by the pool then you will be statisfied with this property. The restaurants are good but not great and the staff is very friendly. If you are a golfer plan a trip to La Cana its probably the closest course to the hotel and worth every penny. ( I paid $150 USD) All in all this is was a very nice resort when we visited and I'm sure it will continue to improve over time. If you've never been to the DR before then remember to bring American singles. The locals want them and changing larger bills can be a bit of a pain in the neck. If you aren't a fan of the super resorts that have their own transist system then the Majestic is for you.

<Content>My Majestic My Heart Hola Everyone!My wife and I just spent 10 beautiful days at the Majestic. We went there to celebrate our love and and exchange our vows on the beach. Our trip was originally scheduled for 7 days, but how could we possibly leave so soon!? Complete with amenities that will blow your mind, and a landscape that will re-new your faith, this place has it all!Upon arrival we were greeted by the sweetest of souls in a setting that can only be described as MAJESTIC! I knew we were in for a beautiful trip. What I didn't realize at that moment, was that our lives were about to change forever. The relationships we forged over the coming 10 days with the staff and guest at Majestic was overwhelming. I'd like to take a moment to name a few of these people. First, Mike Bryant, Mike is the Guest service Manager and an amazing human being. This gentleman went out of his way to ensure our trip would be unforgettable. Mike also conducted our service on the beach. Let me say, his words sang to our souls and inspired us forever. The Majestic is only one year old. With a staff that includes the likes of Mike Bryant, they have years of success ahead!!!Second, I can't leave out our friend Aurilleo Sanchez. Aurilleo is the man in charge of the weddings. He is also a large reason the resort is reaching new levels of success. Mr. Sanchez is a gentleman, and true professional. He took our hand and gently guided us through the most special day of our life. He can always be found to answer any questions, and was very committed to our needs. I thank him from the bottom of our hearts. Next, I'd like address someone I was honored to watch at work. As our trip went on I was always aware of the presence of the Hotels General Manager Mr. Jose Maria Gutierrez. Every army needs a General. Folks let me tell you, this gentleman is blessed with the ability to lead and lead well. He leads his staff with a dignity and class I have not seen anywhere. Here in New York I work closely with some of the top restaurants and consult them with ways to run their business better. I would honestly like to send some of the top managers I work with study with Mr. Gutierrez. They would benefit greatly. The detail and precision he works with was admirable. From working in every restaurant to ensure great meals to helping each guest as a friend and family. It was indeed a pleasure. We thank you Jose..And we will not forget you:)Last but not least.........AnimationMy brothers and sisters for life.....I have yet to meet a group of people sooo special. We fell in love with each of them. This group works vigorously and tirelessly all day long to entertain the guest. Led by Jose and Sandy, the bunch gets you up and in the mood to party. We made a very dear friend in Tyson. The backbone of this group, Tyson became a friend we will keep forever. It will be difficult in the coming days to get use to life without them. To not share a conversation with Jose or Mily in the morning. To not dance the night away with Tyson. I will miss them all terribly.A big hello to our dear friends Thomas, Jean Marc, Natasha, Manel and Kevin!!!! Hope our paths cross again!My wife and have traveled extensively over the years...But it was truly the Majestic that captured our hearts. We will return as quickly as life allows....Till then with tears I say good-bye to all my family there....We love you all!!! Thank you!!!Greetings Once Again:It has been several days that Shaska and I have returned from the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. If you read my first review you found our great gratitude and love for the entire staff there. As our post honeymoon continues to bring us back to life before the Majestic, I can't help but to drift back to that heavenly spot over and over. What I realized is I left out so much...ie..The restaurants, Bars, Disco, Nightly Entertainment, the pool, the immaculate beach! Where do I begin....The Beach, we love the beach, it is our true source of comfort. We plan our trips accordingly. The beach here was nothing short than magnificent. Clear blue waters overlapping soft white sand. There was one day when a ton of seaweed came onshore. It was not the prettiest site at all. However, as if on stand-by, a team of about 20 men came down and began to rake it all together and place it all into giant garbage bags. It was all gone in a few hours. WOW. That's what I call quick service. Back to the water...I have many issues with my feet. Ouch, I walk all over New York City all day! I hate going to a beach and stepping on rock after rock. It becomes counter productive to my rehabilitation. No problem here! Just wonderful sand everywhere. Beware the occasional piece of coral. Try to bring it up, they make for great souvenirs. Restaurants....So many to choose from. Our favorite was Le Gourmet. The hotels premier French Bistro. Prepare for a 4 course dinner to please even the pickiest of palates. The service as well was to be commended. For a great steak, try Taino's...This restaurant serves up a wonderful steak and has the best salad bar. Finish your meal with a glass of Mamajauna. The islands signature after dinner rum....YUMMY! Next up, if you鈥檙e a fan of Hibachi, Majestic has an ideal place for you. The chef's presentation was delightful, and the food was even better. For the most part all the other restaurants are a variety of different buffets. I hate buffets!!! However, I have to give high marks to the ones found here. The service could be a bit slow at the tables however, but be patient your on Vacation!!The POOL....AWESOME...Have you ever seen a 4000 sq. foot swimming pool. We walked the entire length one-day with our new friend Thomas from Germany and had a ball. With brief stops at various pool bars, we completed our journey in 40 minutes!!!Nightly Entertainment: There are a few shows that should not be missed. The Michael Jackson Show had us moonwalking out of there. Also, not sure what it's called, but there's a dance show that YOU CAN NOT MISS.....After the shows each night everyone heads over to the disco to dance the night away shoot some pool and have FUN....Try not to get to bed to late, there's just sooo much to soak in tomorrow!!!Streams Of Joy,Joe  Shaska Velez

<Content>Beautiful Family Resort Just returned from a week over the Christmas holiday with our family of 9, ranging in age from 12 - 64. Booked a charter out of Boston. Grounds, common areas and rooms are beautiful and clean. Jr. Suite quite large with 2 double beds and a cot (a twin bed) still gave us more than enough room for three people. Very large shower, double sinks, jacuzzi tub in room, balcony overlooking the pool area, Mattresses quite hard, pillows quite soft. No clock in room. Our first all-inclusive. Food was quite good and sometimes excellent, and certainly many choices. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Some speak little English but we could always make ourselves understood with our list of basic Spanish words and phrases. Though tipping is not required, a dollar or two each day in the room at the bars and restaurants was much appreciated. Lots of sports activities for the preteen/teen kids- basketball court, tennis courts, kayaks, boogie boards and many games each day. Get pool towels early and place them on your pool or beach chairs to reserve your place. Our family also enjoyed a 1/2 day horseback riding trip off site. Weather was in the 80's and sunny. Evenings brought live music on the terrace outside of the lobby, a show at 10pm, the small casino, and a late night disco for those interested (we were all in bed before midnight.)

<Content>Not a five star, but beautiful resort Well I have stayed at a Sandals resort before, so I guess they kind of raise the bar when it comes to All-Inclusives. The Majestic Colonial is by no means a five star resort, however the grounds were lovely, the ocean is clean (Minimal seaweed) and the rooms were well kept. The food is not very good at all. Bring Immodium as my party of 9 all got some form of sickness (from bathroom issues to vomitting). The staff is not very friendly, especially in the casino! I would give the majestic a 3, and would not return there for the money we spent over Christmas vacation to stay there. Also, many of the guests seemed a bit rude and lacking class. I felt like I was staying at a Holiday Inn. Thank goodness for the beauty of Punta cana and the gorgeous weather!

<Content>As expected but probably the last time for an all-inclusive Coming on the heels of our stay last year at Sunscape the Beach, we decided to go back to Punta Cana. Since I couldn't get a room at Sunscape, tried the Majestic.Some observations:1. Well managed. The service level is probably as good as it is going to get at this type of hotel in the Dominican.2. Both the beach and pool areas were well maintained and very pleasurable. I cannot understand prior compaints about the roughness of the surf or comparisons of it to the Atlantic Ocean beaches of the Northeast. Other than swimming in a pond or a lake this is as mellow as the ocean gets. Pool water temp is not optimal as the sun is not as intense in the winter and therefore you cannot hang in the pool as long.3. Food is at best mediocre. Given my experience last year at Sunscape, we expected marginal food options. However, this was worse than Sunscape. Less diversity in salads, no nightly variation (little). Everything seemed old and cold, if it was just slightly fresher and hotter it would have made it a little better.4. We bought alot of snacks (pretzels, nuts, candy, etc.) which served us well in between meals.I don't mind paying the prices (week of X-mas, larger suite) because to be in the sun and have the beach access is worth it.However, this will be my last all-inclusive. I need more control over my food choices and like to explore. My son will be old enough to do that in the future.

<Content>Wonderful Trip!! Overall our trip to the Majestic was excellent. We stayed there from Dec. 20-28th, the weather was beautiful everyday, the few times it rained during our stay happened after 9pm. The food was fantastic, my mom is a native dominican and a lot of the food was dead on perfect. The sancocho is excellent and the mangu is a creamy as mashed potatoes. Christmas Eve was amazing, all the men received santa hats as they entered the restaurant and all the women received red roses, rose petals adorned every table with candles. There was every kind of food you could ever want, huge lobsters, roasted pork, beef, turkey, sushi, and well tons of everything. The pool was amazing and so was the beach. Yes, as some posters have noted there is a musty smell in the rooms (we brought a scented candle), the beds are about as hard as sleeping on a slab of concrete, but I suppose not everything can be perfect. We were never out of clean towels and our mini bar was always filled. I did catch the Michael Jackson show and it was pretty good. The service is fantastic and always excellent whether or not you gave a tip, but I felt compelled to give one to just about everyone because they were just so wonderful. They did have vendors in the hotel for a day in case you wanted to buy any jewelry items, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, it is not real silver and WAY overpriced. We took a taxi twice into the city if Higuey (about 30 minutes away) because we have family there, great food to be found and shopping as well. If you get a chance to go there do yourself a favor and visit the Basilica, you can't miss it and it is a beautiful.

<Content>majestic - good but not great Just returned from the Majestic - a few comments:1. Food was ok - presentation - great - watch out for salad dressings - other cold food - we got the tourist bug - snacking at night not possible - restaurant that we were told would be open late was closed - our teenage son was not happy2. Pool clean and beautiful - ocean - great - beach clean - chairs available at any time of day3. Resort is quite lovely - some staff friendly and helpful - lack of English can be a problem4. Maid service sporatic - when I asked for clean glasses and cups - she simply rinsed them in the sink - using tap water that we don't brush our teeth with - not too hygenic - I went and asked at the bar for plastic5. Saxaphone player is the best - at night - under the stairs - listening to him is delightful6. Gym equipment (treadmill) not working - staff didn't really seem to care - if you advertise a gym - make sure it is up to standardsWe would not return unless they had their own water treatment facility - which other resorts do have

<Content>Loved the majstic I just want to say this trip was amazing. I was to punta cana two years ago but this trip way out did the last one. I attended with a two friends from college and one of their husbands. The couple was on their honeymoon and asked us to join them on the trip. The entertainment staff is wonderful! They put on a great show at night. During the day they are around the pool and the beach offering lots of games for everyone to enjoy. They love to become involved with everyone. We had such a great time hanging out with the group. By the end of the week they knew us by name. It was also great that they were able to hang out at the disco after their show. They helped everyone learn the dances and feel welcome. I don't know how they keep going with all the hours that they work. You would never know it though. I just can't say enough good things about the entertainment team. The pool was excellent. It was huge so you never felt crowded. There were always plenty of chairs so you didn't have to get up early to save a chair. We had a great time at the bars. All of the bartenders that we met were very friendly. Not all speak very much English but they still like to have a good time with you. The food was excellent. We ate at the Mexican Restaurant about every night. It was probably the closest to the American food. We also ate at the buffet and the steakhouse. I can't complain at all about the food. What an excellent resort to stay at. I am sure we will be back next year.

<Content>loved it We stayed for too weeks and had a great time. The best all inclusive i have styed in. The Steak resturant was our favourite. But we enjoyed them all. I dont know why some reviews said the food was boaring. I have never seen so many choices as what was served in the bufett resturant there was everything you could think of including salmon and champagne for breakfast. The staff were very polite we never had a rude member of staff they could not be more helpfull. If you try and speak a bit of spanish they love it. The rooms were great and kept clean. We took our own pillows, but didnt need to as they bought you more if needed. The swimming pool was great  so was the beach plenty of sun beds what ever time you went down. We used mosie repellent in the evening. The entertainment was good , we liked the Jazz player and the entertainment staff did a good job some of the shows were great they are fantastic dancers. The trips are all the same we went on a safari wich was worth doing as you got to see a bit of dominican republic. There is not much to do outside of the Hotel but for sun sea and relaxing i would recomend we will be going back again next year. Take American Dollars otherwise you loose so much on the exchange rates like 35 paso instead of 53 paso to the British Pound. If you are going deep sea fishing (best to book on line (you get a better rate using pay pal ) We used Mikes fishing tours. Biggest Fish caught on our boat was a Blue Marlin 160 pounds sad to say it wasnt my husband that caught it. If you go shopping just outside the hotel there are some shops but barter hard you should expect to pay about 1/3 to 1/2 of what they ask. Shops in hotel very expensive take sun cream etc with you do not buy there

<Content>A Very Nice Place, Especially for Families Overall, this is a very, very nice all-inclusive resort on a wonderful property and beach.First, expect a bus ride of approximately 40 minutes over seriously bad roads, maybe 30 if you have a taxi or other direct hire. The DR needs to invest immediately in improved roadways to the Punta Cana resorts, or they're going to lose visitors.The resort is impressive, and it begins with the entrance. Check-in was easy and fast, with the bellmen in perfect sync with the front desk, the bags arriving at the room as soon as we did. Everyone arriving gets a virgin Majestic welcome drink (or more, if you'd like).The rooms are a very good size, each with a balcony. There is ample closet space, iron and board, a programmable safe, one robe, and lots of space for suitcases. The TV has a good mix of English, Spanish, German, and French cable, with channels for the kids, too. There is a massive shower (enough for 3 or 4--yow!) and a separate whirlpool tub in the room itself. There is a small fridge which is stocked with soda, water, and beer, and you get a bottle of champagne on arrival (actually, it's German weinhaltiges Getraenk).Our looked out onto the resort's single pool, a massive thing stretching almost the entire length of the resort to the beach. The water was consistently clean, with no debris. The pool deck, bottom tiles, and entry railings do need maintenance, though. The pool has plenty of deck space, with ample shade cabanas and very nice chaise lounges. There are numerous pool bars, and waiter/waitress service.The clientele was all over the place. As Americans, we were in the minority here, usually mistaken for Canadians. Lots of Europeans, especially French, Germans, and Italians. Also Iranians, Russians, and South Americans. Consequently, you get a number of topless ladies at the pool and the beach, and a laissez-faire attitude toward a bit of discreet full nudity as many Europeans would change into and out of their swimsuits poolside/on the beach. No big deal.The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful. I recommend a fistful of 5s, 10s, and 20s as tips to the staff, which his always well received. The only staff I encountered with attitude were the two ladies in the mini-market store, who consistently over 3 days had seriously unfriendly and peeved attitudes.The staff is passable in English, but a little bit of Spanish always helps things along. I recommend the Majestic invest in some basic English classes for all of its staff.The food was outstanding, especially for an all-inclusive resort. I stayed at the St. Lucia Sandals two years ago, and their institutional food was awful compared to the excellently prepared and presented food on offer here. There are usually three buffets to choose from, and sit-down, menu-order restaurants as well. Each place offers a variety of local fare as well, which I found most often to be the best food offered. To their credit, the Majestic has established and actually strictly enforces dress codes for the restaurants, such as men having to wear shirts in the beach dining room, and having to wear shoes in all other restaurants. A small touch, but it goes a long way to keeping things classy.There is a massive theater, and there are kids' movies every night. There is also a kiddie stage show, in which they get to participate. This is for the 3-7 crowd. The kiddie play area is small, but adequate. It is not that well developed.The casino also is small, mostly slot machines. There is a sports bar with a single pool table. There is no game room/arcade for the teenagers.The beach is close, and also has dozens of shade cabanas and the same chaise lounges. The sand is white and fine, just short of sugar sand. It's great for digging and sand castles. The surf is just right for kids, with an average beach break of about 2 feet. The surf is not good for boogie-boarding/body surfing. If you want that, you can go north/west about 1/2 mile up the beach for a much better place with a consistent 4-6 foot break about 60 yards out.Snorkeling and scuba from the beach is definitely not recommended, as there's a great deal of boat traffic, often traveling at high speed. The hotel has buoys marking the swimming area, and venturing outside this area is quite dangerous.The beach is marvelously free of hawkers and pitchmen. If you go up or down the beach, expect to be accosted by women wanting to braid hair and men offering parasailing, scuba, snorkeling, jewelry, etc. But on the hotel beach, there is none of that.This is a great family place. I was there with the wife, 2 kids, my sister, and my two parents. Everyone loved the place, and may well return in the near future. The place was packed with many families, and many little children. This is definitely a kid-friendly location. It also is most definitely not a singles destination.All in all, this is an outstanding resort, a welcoming place that is definitely worth every penny you're paying.

<Content>Nice resort but won't go back We stayed from Dec. 10 - 17 at the Majestic. The resort was very nice and was probably 4 stars for a third world country. We found the front desk to be not the most helpful and acted as if they did not understand English. The rest of the staff knew very little English but were always friendly. The pool was very big and very nice we were always able to find a chair. The ocean was nice although they seemed to be having so weed issues, however the water was warm and the sun was wonderful.The food was okay the dinner buffet was nothing special the breakfast buffet was mush better. We eat at the seafood restaurant, which was very good, the French restaurant was nice by way overcooked. The steakhouse was good but got a bug of some sort and had cramps and other stomach issues which are still not completely gone a week after we are home.We found many of the other guests to be extremely pushing and at times down right rude. Do to the various languages being spoken we did not have the opportunity to speak to many other guests.While we did relax and came home with nice tans, we would not go back in the future.

<Content>rest and relaxation in the sun My family just returned from a week at the Majestic. My husband and I took our sons (age 18 and 21) and had a great time. There is something for everyone, or if you want to do nothing, that's ok too. I started everyday (much to my surprise), in the gym. As hotels go, this gym was more than adequate. The equipment is in very good condition (although measurement is in kilograms and not lbs) and there is enough cardiovascular equipment to get a good sweat going (before lying around on a beach chair). Cesar oversaw the gym and he was knowledgeable and very friendly. I even took the 9AM aerobics class with Cesar (good for beginning to intermediate excercisers) to switch things up. Cesar also speaks English very well.My kids also enjoyed the gym, and enjoyed the music played in there.The food was fine, but got tiresome by the end of the week. My kids (picky eaters), survived on pizza and pasta. Breakfast is the best meal! Fresh fruit and juices are great. Some foods were a bit of a mystery. But we had no stomach issues.The beach is beautiful. If you are not one to lay around, then you can snorkel, boogie board, kayak or sail. Late in the day we ended up at the pool to top the day off. It was beautiful and we went to a quiet section away from the many poolside activities offered.Night life was a bit quiet, but we were tired, so that was not a priority. We all went to relax and we did just that. There is a bit of a language barrier, but that was not an issue and was actually a fun part of the trip. We strongly recommend this resort. What you do while there is totally up to you, but there is plenty to do!!!

<Content>Excellent Value - Worth the Visit! This is really a great hotel for the money. It is only one year old. I really recommend this resort - you will have a great time. Before going I read all the reviews, and paid close attention to the negative ones - which made me real nervous. The bottom line is that the negative reviews are not really accurate. Here is the lowdown:(1) The food is actually pretty good if you know where to eat. The breakfast is excellent. The lunch is so-so, but we mostly skipped it because we ate such a large breakfast. The Chateaubriand at the Rodeo Steakhouse is as good as anything you will get here in Boston. The Japanese Habachi style was also excellent. Also know that you don't need reservations for the steakhouse, nor to eat the sushi at the Japanese restaurant (which was pretty good). Sure, there are some spotty things at the buffet, but overall the food was alright. Also, I didn't meet anyone who got sick.(2) We found the service to be excellent. The people are very friendly. Sure, they don't all speak perfect english, but they try and always have a smile. Also, there are a lot of Europeans and Canadians at this hotel which makes it a whole lot more fun than your regular hotel at Aruba or some place like that.(3) The beds are not very comfortable - they are your typical Holiday Inn style bed (actually same brand I think). The pillows are very slim, so bring your own. I think they use these foam pillows to keep out the mold from growing.(4) We had an excellent room. We asked for quiet, and guess what, we got very quiet. Never heard a single thing in our room. We asked for second floor, away from noise, with no adjoining door inside the room. We were really pleased with the quietness. If you are a light sleeper, this hotel has something for you. I was really impressed.All in all, you will love this resort - don't listen to the negative posts. For the money, this is an extraordinary deal. Sure, it isn't the Westin Resort on Maui, but also you aren't paying $400 a night, and to be fair, it isn't all that far from the Westin in terms of quality.

<Content>A perfect week... Absolutely loved it! First time in DR (but we have been to St Lucia  Antigua). Here's what we thought...Resort - we arrived at night and were blown away by the gorgeous lobby and all the sparkly lights through the grounds - it looked lovely... and it was just as beautiful during the day. Immaculate.Staff - lovely, friendly and professional without exception. Room - standard room overlooking the pool- great! spacious, brilliant aircon, quiet, bathrobes. We had twin beds which was fine, but quite snug in one together- couples should ask for king bed room if you like to sprawl.Beach - beautiful, especially in the moonlight. Quite busy, but always sunbeds to be had, breeze off the ocean kept us cool, crashing waves kept us entertained, sea is a perfect temperature, lovely soft sand, shady palm trees - yeah we liked.Pool - immaculate, lovely for cooling off and lazily wading to the bar...Food - very good, breakfast in the main buffet was always great, steak restaurant great, seafood restaurant OK, Gourmet restaurant not so great. Dominican and main buffet for dinner - great.What else? I'm so chilled out I can't remember... ha ha.Bugs. I was anxious about malaria and we even took the meds for 1 week, but felt sick... so just kept our room doors closed and used Deet on exposed bits at night - I didn't get a single bite (I'm usually eaten alive) we saw about 3 mosquitos all week, but did notice a few people who had been bitten...OK, now the downsides... no sorry can't think of any except maybe that the 'entertainment' by the main pool bar during the day was uneccesarily loud, now I'm all for a little bit of step aerobics in a bikini / speedos (!) but turn the PA down please! OVERALL the all inclusive concept works brilliantly here, so if you're looking for a very relaxing, chilled out, week or so in the sunshine with not much to do other than snooze, swim, read, eat - you couldn't do any better than the Majestic.

<Content>Majestic Oh Majestic I took my wife for her 50th(suprise) birthday. Champagne and fresh fruit carved tray in the room shortly after we arrived! Some what nervous since this was our first all-inclusive travel. Debbie at cheap caribbean was GREAT! The pictures on the internet are good but, in real life they don't do justice!, much more beautiful being there! Great selection of food, never went hungry! The French restaurant was dissapointing! The Japanese was AWESOME, met some great people there! If you like SUSHI, you can walk -in no reservation needed! The steak and seafood restaurants at the beach were ALSO great! The entertainment and activities were ALSO great! The activity group was very energetic for the long days they work (Tyson, Catalina and my friend Michael Jackson) were my favorite. Activities and entertainment all day long was great! Music by the main lobby every night was very relaxing (Dominic played the sax and Thomas a hotel geust from Germany also played). The entertainment at night next to the lobby was also Great! Only missed one night, very fun, energetic and entertaining!The beach was GREAT! The staff was very friendly! The bars were GREAT! For our first all-inclusive trip it was GREAT and will be HARD to be BEAT!!The only problem are the PILLOWS!!!! Very thin and soft!I WILL RECOMMEND THE MAJESTIC TO ANYONE WANTING TO TAKE AN ALL INCLUSIVE VACATION!

<Content>Take The Good With The Bad!!! We stayed at the resort from Nov 24th - Dec. 1st. The lobby and hotel was awesome. We went down with 21 people. Anybody travelling with young kids must try the Majestic. We brought our 6 year old with us and another couple brought thier 2 kids (7  3).There is a castle wear you can bring the kids to play. The girl there was amazing. Our kids are very very shy but Maria at the Majestic made them feel so comfortable they bugged us everyday to go there. We would drop the kids off Mid-Afternoon and pick them up at 5:30. It had 2 waterslides, Playstations, Puzzels and much more. It was nice to take a nap on the beach knowing our kids were in great hands. The staff were all very nice but did not speak english to good but we all managed. The place was beautiful, the beach was great. I found there was lots of sitting for everybody. We never had to wait at the resturants and travelling with that many people thats amazing. The bad points would be the house keeping. They never did the same thing twice. Every day we had a different number of towel, we never did get the hand and face towels requested. There was a seperate guy filling the fridge and he didn't show up twice. The noise in the hallways were insane plus if you had ajoining rooms you couldn't even open your suitcase without the next room hear you. But all in all it was great!!

<Content>majestic was sooooo much fun!!! We stayed at the Majestic from Nov. 24-29th, 2006. My husband and another couple went there for 20th anniversary trip. Everything was so wonderful...we booked through Cheap Carribean.com and everything went very smooth. The airport was a little confusing, but everyone there was helpful. Our trip to the hotel was interesting (hang on)!!! Our driver even stopped at a store for us when we told him cervesa!!! The resort was wonderful and beautiful. The food was excellent and nobody got sick and everything seemed very fresh. The entire staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The beds are hard and the pillows are flat, but if you drink enough of ron rum, it really doesn't matter:) We asked for more pillows and that helped. The animation team I swear works 25 hrs a day to make everything fun!! Ernesto was our favorite bartender, ask him to make you a dirty monkey....yum....tastes like a banana split!!!! The french restaurant was excellent. The only bad service we had, was at the Japanese restaurant...the other people we were with spoke spanish and the cook did too...we felt a little left out, not their fault, ours for not knowing spanish, the Japanese places in the states are much better and put on a better show. This also could have been because our reservation was at 9:30 pm (the only one we could get).The beach is wonderful...the sand is so soft and white and never gets hot!!! We couldn't figure that one out!!! The ocean is a little rough....but still beautiful!!!! We wnt snorkling one day and it was very rough out there...but still very cool...My suggestions are take an insulated mug, tip well, don't buy anything from the resort stores...way too expensive, go to the stores outside of the resort. and remember you're in a 3rd world country...things are not going to be like in the states!!!!

<Author>TravelerNJ
<Content>MAjestic? hmmm only for it's looks We just returned from Majestic Colonial November 25th and yes we have booked this vacation with cheapcaribbean.com This is the second trip that we have booked and went to with them and they are one of the best on-line travel planners, and absolutely should be trusted. One thing that happened when we booked through them is we have asked the travel agent to book us airplane sits and told her that we preferred front of the plane rather than sitting at the back, when we got to the airport we found out that she did not book sits for us, I don't know why or what went wrong maybe because it was an international flight she wasn't able to book those sits...but it is a such minor thing...Over all she was very helpful in everything, transportation was provided as promissed, travel insurance was sent to us right after we have finished the booking process. I give them 100%.In terms of the resort itself...Gorgeous without a doubt, one of the best we have been to and we are picky. In terms of food, it's more of a 3* resort. If you already booked don't get discouraged, I strongly suggest that you absolutely must visit steak house and seafood restaurants, we went to them almost every night instead of the buffet, seafood portion is very small they only would serve 6-7 shrimp on a plate with a small side or two...but there was never a problem to ask for another portion, just politely mention that the portion served was very small, same situation with a lobster, it looked like a baby lobster :), I finished it in a minute, because it was that good and small :) they brought out 2 more, no problem :)OK, the famous Japanese restaurant.....pleeeeeeeease, if you have been to the japanese restaurant in the United States...and especially habachi, please don't waste your time going there....I mean it's not horrible but I would give it a 3 out of 5...The Dominican Chef did not show us any tricks, he just stood there quietly and cooked us chicken, shrimp, fish and rice with veggies in it, that was the habbachi (not too sure how to spell it: ) ) Japanese restaurant requires reservation, we made it as soon as we have arrived at the resort. This restaurant consists of 2 things, chinese food (for which you do not require a reservation) where you can order not a very good food, as a matter a fact very very untasty. Sushi was a part of the chinese ...yakky, shop rite (Our local supermarket) sells better sushi, I swear.Fried ice cream is a joke, they rolled untasty ice cream in crumbs and flumbe it (set it on fire for a show purposes, yes it did look nice but the shell of the ice cream tasted burned.French restaurant we didn't go to because they would not let kids under 12 in it, so we missed our reservation, not a problem, we heard that people would get up in the middle of the dinner and went to either buffet or to a steak house or seafood restaurant.Ok, about a beach....up to your knees nice and sandy, after that be careful rocky, a man got hurt because he was swimming and stepped as he thought on a rock, yes he did, but something was sitting on top of it...basically he started screaming and was carried out of the water because he had some sort of the needles stuck on his feet, right next to his toes, he was carried to the Doctors office.Service, only Seafood restaurant had friendly staff, the rest would not even smile at you...also keep in mind, they barely or do not speak english there, very very few of them do....a lot of them say hello in spanish ola and if you respond hello or say first hello in english they would still say ola back :)They do work hard no doubt...but when we went to the market outside of the resort, 2-5 minute walk from the main gate we found out that locals dislike Americans...we pretended to be Russians...and one of them actually said, oh good, because I do not like Americans...to which I said...but you do like American Dollars (because they prefer to get paid in US Dollars rather than Pessos).Entertainment, poor, when we went to Jamaica, RIU OCho Rios entertainment was 1st class, and I thought food was not that great there, in comparison to Majestic it was a 5 * :)Please do not get discouraged, noone has died there from starvation, there is plenty you can find to eat, it's just below my expectation, since I travel a lot I expected better of this resort food wise and beach wise(it was our first time in the Dominican Republic)Resort is gorgeous and just that will boost your vaation on it's own....forgot to mention the swimming pool, one of the best I have ever seen, does not get crowded there, very private and romantic.Rooms are the best!!!!!!!!!!!! too romantic and we were lucky...we had the best view in the house ocean front and corner of the swimming pool, but most of the views are on the pool if you are on the pool side if you are on the opposite side you will face the garden, or the wall to the other resort...:(ask for rooms in the section of 2240+ up to 2252 or higher floors you will not regret.Have a wonderful vacation.

<Content>Great place, but take loads of $1 bills for tipping This is a fabulous place for RR. We had a wonderful time and especially enjoyed the beach, food and swimming pool. If you wanted to get involved with the planned entertainment there was lots to get involved with, but at the same time you were also able to get away from it and find some piece and quiet. We had the most amazing massage in the Spa, which was a real treat. The average other resident was very smart and well turned out especially in the evening, when it felt like a real occasion going out of your room, and the whole atmosphere of the hotel changed completely, assisted by the beautiful lighting.We were bitten by the flying wild-life, so take and use insect repellent, however in the evening the site is sprayed with insecticide.The only element that slightly surprised us (being tight Brit's ) was the number of Americans tourists also in the hotel, who were delightful in themselves but they have a completely different tipping culture to us Brit's, who think that all-inclusive is you get their and don't have to spend any money whilst on site, but leave a tip for the Bell Captain and Chamber Maid at the end of your time however be prepared to tip at any opportunity, for which you are rewarded with amazing service next time. Take at least $100 in $1 bills as change isn't easily available, and plan it into your budget.

<Content>Loved the Majestic We stayed at the Majestic from Nov.22-26. We traveled with our two sons ages 5 and 21. When we arrived at the hotel they had reserved for us two Jr. Garden Suites and we asked if it was possible to be given pool view rooms since we had requested it with the travel agency in Puerto Rico. The person at the front desk was kind enough to upgrade our rooms free of charge to two swimming pool access rooms on the first floor with jacuzzis on the balcony.. We were absolutely very grateful and pleased with the rooms. The rooms are very comfortable. For us the bathroom was no problem. The only thing was the pillows, but that got easily resolved by asking for extra pillows.The food in the restaurants were very good. We went only to the Mexican/Caribbean , the Steakhouse and the Seafood Restaurant where we liked the food very much. We went to the Buffet restaurant every morning and we went twice for dinner. We considered the buffet at night O.K. The pool was beautiful. It ran the length of the hotel. The beach was nice also but we didn't go in because of the waves. People with children beware on the beach where you go because there were a lot of topless women there. We where at one of the beach huts with our five year old and when we noticed that we were surrounded by them we had to leave before our five year old noticed. We also saw a couple of them in the pool area. Shows-We only got to go to one of the shows which was the 70's-80's night. It was very entertaining. The others we didn't get to watch because our five year old was out before 10:00 pm which was when all of the shows started.Tours- We took the jeep safari tour where each group of four people are given a jeep to drive. We were a total of about 9 jeeps. We went through sugar cane fields, a Domincan family house, where we were shown how they lived, and they also showed us how they made coffee, cacao, and other things. We were also taken to a Mercado where you could buy paintings or souvenirs and get something to drink. Then we were taken to a ranch right on the beach where we were given lunch, then took a 15 minute horseback ride then got to relax in the hammocks or go in the water. We all enjoyed this tour very much.All in all we loved the Majestic and would not hesitate in going back at all.

<Content>EXCELLENT RESORT BUT HAS IT'S NEGATIVES TOO I booked the Majestic Colonial for my husband鈥檚 40th birthday. Whilst we had an excellent holiday and thought the hotel was great and the beach lovely, there are 10 good and 10 bad points which I hope will help all including the hotel, tour operator etc.) as follows:-Good Points :-1.The cleanliness of the hotel was superb. The staff are very good and are always cleaning. 2.The Japanese Restaurant was excellent and well worth going to. It is extremely entertaining, with the chef booking everything in front of you, very good service and the food absolutely wonderful if you like Japanese of course. The Chinese part of the restaurant is also excellent and of particular note, the lemon chicken deserves a mention. Sushi of course excellent!!!3.The hotel was very impressive and beautiful with lush gardens given that it has only been open for a year. Very impressive and congratulations to the management team and staff for working so hard to get a good team together in such a short time.4.The staff were very friendly for the most part. Although previous posts have been given on the lack of English spoken, we do not speak Spanish and we had no problems at all. 5.The steak and seafood restaurants were very good. Of particular note we enjoyed the Kebab (I think they called it a Brioche which I thought was bread!), the Chateau Brion steak and in the seafood restaurant the shrimps were lovely. However, all meals were good at these two restaurants and I think you could chose anything from the menu and be happy. 6.The beach was long  beautiful for the most part and we particularly loved the crashing waves that knocked you over and found this entertaining and fun. Again this is personal choice.7.The pool is extremely long and winding and runs the whole length of the resort 鈥?beautiful.8.The rooms are lovely 鈥?we had a standard room but found this to be more than adequate 鈥?we personally don鈥檛 see the point of a very small outside Jacuzzi (the upgraded rooms) when the standard room has a much larger Jacuzzi inside.9.The Michael Jackson evening (on Sundays) was well worth attending and very good entertainment.10.All in all a great vacation with no dodgy tummys and although we have read bad reviews about the pillows, once we had requested a couple more we personally had no problems with these.Bad Points :-1.The standard rooms are interconnecting and so you can hear your neighbours constantly, talking, showering, using the hairdryer, watching television 鈥?need I go on !!2.鈥楽iestas鈥?don鈥檛 exist in the hotel. You just can鈥檛 sleep. The trolleys the porters use are enough to wake the dead (please change the wheels and make them less noisy). We tried to sleep between 5 and 7 pm each day 鈥?forget it!! Never stayed in such a noisy bedroom on holiday 鈥?ever !!. I think a lot has to do with the way the blocks are laid out and the sound just carries 鈥?people walking to get to their rooms. You may think I鈥檓 complaining unnecessarily but believe you me we鈥檝e stayed in Sandals in Cuba, Bahia in Mexico (all 5 star) and never had this trouble before. FYI we stayed in block 4 but I鈥檓 sure it must be applicable to all blocks as they all have the same design.3.The room cleaning was inconsistent. We only had the full amount of towels on the first night and last night!! When I rung down for more they never arrived so we often had to use our fresh beach towels. I would also like to add that the rooms still have quite a bit of plaster (from the newness) that still needs cleaning off in places 鈥?rooms not finished to a high workmanship standard. That would downgrade it from a 5 star in my opinion.4.The buffet restaurant (in main building) is substandard to most places we have been (all 5 star). The hot food is barely luke warm and we had one evening in there and thought never again. Unfortunately you have no choice at breakfast which again was not up to standard, although the service is excellent and coffee very hot which was a bonus.5.There is a space of beach between the Majestic and the Bahia Principe next door ( to the right) which is very dirty and littered with rubbish. I personally would expect both management teams of the two respective hotels to get their heads together and take joint responsibility to try and keep this area tidy and litter free whether the land belonged or not!! Afterall yet again it reflects on the hotel and this vacant littered bit of beach is only to the right of where the Majestic carry out the weddings.6.The hotel don鈥檛 advertise the fact that you can eat in the Chinese/Sushi part of the Japanese restaurant without a booking. We were lucky to find this information out at the beginning of our holiday (though a visitor not through hotel staff) although many people we spoke to had no idea. Why the big secret 鈥?it鈥檚 empty most evenings! The food is excellent in there also. What a waste 鈥?come on hotel sort your act out!! The lemon chicken is devine and Sushi incredible 鈥?advertise it!!7.Even though I had emailed the hotel prior to my departure about my husband鈥檚 40th I was disappointed to find it went unacknowledged. It is afterall a big birthday. I have had cards left in my room before now at previous resorts or a T-shirt on the bed or something!! Also I spoke to Mike and told him I had booked the Japanese for my husband鈥檚 birthday as that was his favourite restaurant. I informed him that although I didn鈥檛 want a cake, an acknowledgement would be nice on the evening, ie a fuss of some sort by the staff!! Nothing happened 鈥?again it went unnoticed. What a disappointment. Hey we had our own celebration but just a point I鈥檓 making. He had a good birthday courtesy of me.8.The beach bar is terrible!!!!!!!! The bar staff are extremely rude and seem to only serve the men first. You wait, wait, wait and wait. In other resorts we have stayed you can help yourself to water and also to the iced cold drinks as they face them outwards and leave cups. This in our opinion is the most important place for drinks from the beach so come on, improve the service and let some half of it be self service to avoid the cues 鈥?how difficult can it be.9.To get away from all my complaints focusing on the hotel I would like to complain about Global who I booked the holiday through. I asked whether we had a private transfer to the hotel and made it clear that what I meant by that was we would only go to out hotel. The lady who I booked the holiday through insisted that if there were 6 people on our flight who were going to the Majestic we would share, but if we were the only 2 then so be it. Under no circumstances would we have to go to any other hotels. The reason I asked the question was because I would have paid for a taxi! She didn鈥檛 known her facts and yes we went to 2 other hotels prior to ours both on the way to the hotel and on the way to the airport on the departure 鈥?please tour operators get every detail correct or if you don鈥檛 know the answer don鈥檛 make it up as it can make or break someones holiday 鈥?it is so irritating.10.Finally, my last complaint goes to Thomson Fly! Raw sewerage leaking from the front toilet all the way home 鈥?sodden carpets, please!!!! Isn鈥檛 that against Health  Safety!!Finally, I was informed by one of the staff at the Majestic that he thought the Brits whinge more than the Americans so the bad points are especially for you!!Seriously though on a final note we had a very good holiday but personally I think everyone should be aware of things that have upset people as well as what they鈥檝e liked (it鈥檚 obviously someone鈥檚 personal opinion) Thank you for reading this.

<Content>Majestic Colonial Punta Can - complain for better service Dear Sirs,We feel the need to make some comments concerning our vacations in Majestic Colonial Punta Can hotel during last week. We travel a lot and every time we do it we normally go to 5 stars hotels and one of the reasons we do it is because we expect to have a 5 stars service. In this hotel it seams that the employees are making a favor to serve us, for example they don't smile, they do everything very slow, they don't speak English (they don't understand it or they don't want to understand, and this kind off attitudes aren't suppose to happen in a 5 stars hotel. Concerning entertainment, we were very pleased to see that you have very good employees (mr.jesus, mr.tyson, mr.nelson and mr.pablo) from the other side we had some unpleasant situations with mr.jose (he should be more professional because as we understand he is the second 'chief'), and the security man in the discotheque (he took us cigarettes without asking for it, we complain in English and he answered something like 'non te entiendo'...).So, we wish that this mail will help Majestic Colonial Punta Cana having a better service.Best regardsjdomingues

<Content>Great Time We spent 7 nights from Oct. 18-25th at the Majestic. Trip from airport was interesting. Pool was nice, beach was the best! Breakfast was the best meal of the day so fill up. Room was great ,service was good, The local rum and beer were okay but I will say we did miss a choice of brands. They had a few other brands however you had to pay for them. That's really the only thing we really missed. We didnt have too much trouble with the language. Also, lots of topless women and to be honest most of them should'nt have been. We would go back.

<Content>MAJESTIC is FANTASTIC From member IslandViewer:The MajesTIC is fantasTIC, romanTIC, and authenTIC; their staff is enthusiasTIC; and the Animation Team is energeTIC!!!We stayed there from Oct 28 to Nov 4, 2006RESORT: New, beautiful, and a very well-planned layout. BEST pool we鈥檝e ever seen (sparkling clear and no chemical smell). Plenty of lounge chairs and palapas at the pool and on the wide beautiful beach. Grounds are meticulously maintained. Walkways between and within the buildings are covered in case of rain. Nicely lit up at night 鈥?especially the pools and the walkways.EMPLOYEES: Courteous, happy, helpful, professional. Every staff member (at every level) that we met would smile and greet us with a friendly 鈥淗ola鈥? The service at the bars and restaurants was excellent 鈥?they always made sure that we were well taken care of. Majestic Mike at Guest Services is a hard working, very knowledgeable professional that we now consider to be a great friend.And our new friends on the ANIMATION TEAM consisting of Jose, Taison, July, Fernando, Mariel, Nelson, Samuel, Sandy, Willy, and Pablo (hope we got all their names here) were incredible!! They have activities starting every morning at one end of the pool and on one section of the beach, continuing throughout the day, then they perform in the nightly shows, and even join us in dancing at the disco late at night. We don鈥檛 know when they stop and rest! They would always give us a big hello whenever they spotted us. A great Team!FOOD: Very good overall. Fresh omelets and crepes at breakfast and pasta made-to-order for lunch in addition to a large variety of buffet offerings at both mealtimes. Wonderful dinners at all of the 7 restaurants (two are reservations only). We loved the Japanese restaurant and the steaks at the Rodeo steakhouse. Great friendly service at every meal.DRINKS: 8 bars and we 鈥榟it em all鈥?!! Very nice  clean and a good selection for an all-inclusive package. Again great service 鈥?always with a smile. Their Majestic drink is good with rum or vodka. Men 鈥?try the MamaJuanna. :) The in-room mini-bar is restocked daily and the bottle of champagne was a nice touch.ROOM: Large, clean, beautiful. Cherrywood doors, digitally-controlled AC, nice balcony, double sinks, a large shower, terry robes, and a jacuzzi. We had a comfortable 4-poster king bed and extra pillows. The maid service was excellent.ENTERTAINMENT: A different show every night. Some have audience participation (and we 鈥榩urticipated鈥?- LOL). The Michael Jackson show was well done. Talented dancers/acrobats. Again, cheers to the Animation Team!! The disco rocks and we heard that it stays open till ~7 AM. (We 鈥榗rashed鈥?by 2:00 or 3:00 each night).Summary: Our best vacation ever and we are a couple in our late 40鈥檚 early 50鈥檚. Great food, drinks, service, beach, pool, and entertainment. Plenty of activities and also plenty of quiet areas. You can do as much or as little as you desire. WE WILL BE BACK.

<Content>True relaxation at the Majestic My husband and I booked 7 days at the Majestic Colonial on CheapCaribbean.com. We flew on a direct flight from Philly, and had no trouble moving through the Punta Cana airport. It wasn鈥檛 always clear what was coming next, but we had no trouble following the crowd, and the Dominican officials just sort of guided us along. We found our tour operator immediately, and we were taken via a private, air conditioned shuttle to the resort.Check-in was a breeze. We were the only two there, where we enjoyed some delicious frozen Majestic drinks, while everything was explained to us. As soon as we had our room key, a porter whisked us and our luggage toward our room. He pointed out the important sights along the way. Our room was 3330, a Junior Suite, Pool View. We explored the grounds, which were beautiful and took a nap before dinner. The first night is the gala buffet, which we did not know until we tried to go to an a la carte and found it closed. We inquired at Guest Services where they directed us to the buffet. It was so lovely! They had a station outside on the walkway making the evening鈥檚 鈥渃ocktail鈥?(I later learned this happened every evening, and it was wonderful) and they gave each woman a rose as she entered the buffet. I like that the hostesses take you to a seat in the buffet and pull out your chair. It eliminates the aimless walking around and hoping you aren鈥檛 sitting at someone鈥檚 table who just got up to get another plate of food.Most days we spent around the pool in the morning, with some ocean time later in the day. The sand was white, and there were huts a-plenty at the ocean and the pool. The ocean was clean and clear, and much nicer than many other stretches of beach that we passed on a walk down the strip. I got in the ocean in front of another resort and it was rocky vs. the soft sand of the Majestic. The Animation team was great, I was pulled into an archery contest with a dozen people who didn鈥檛 speak my language, but it was still fun! We didn鈥檛 participate in many activities, we prefer to take it easy, but we loved having the gym and game area at our disposal. We caught a couple of the evening shows, and they were nice, but the sound system was very loud for our taste.A word on the language barrier. No, English is not the prevalent language. We tried speaking English to the servers, bartenders, etc. but by Day 3, we pretty much gave up and went to Spanish. It wasn鈥檛 a problem, and since the knowledge was there (it came flooding back) it felt more appropriate anyway. But please keep in mind that these people who are serving you know MANY languages. They have a very hard job of walking up to you in a restaurant, looking at you, and guessing what language you might speak. If you courteously insert your appropriate language, they can reasonably accommodate you. Please don鈥檛 take it personally if they don鈥檛 choose the right language on the first try.There were plenty of included drinks on the AI plan, and we were able to eat lobster, shrimp, and filet mignon, which is more than I can say for many of the other resorts that I researched. All of the food did have a Dominican flair, but that does not mean that it wasn鈥檛 good! I probably gained 5lbs. in crepes and Coco Locos in only a week. We enjoyed all of the restaurants that we ate at: Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Seafood, Gourmet, buffet. We missed the steakhouse, and the only night we weren鈥檛 crazy about the food was the beach party night, but it was worth the trade-off for the music and atmosphere.The saxophone player was fabulous and hanging out around the lobby bar at night was a great way to spend the evening. I wish that the pool was open at night, as the lighting is very romantic, and a night swim would be a lot of fun!One night we had a leak from our ceiling at 1am, and though it wasn鈥檛 my favorite way to be woken up, I have to commend the staff on how efficiently it was handled. From the moment I heard the water and woke up, to the phone call, the service man arriving, fixing it, mopping, and leaving was no more than 30 minutes. At 1am, that鈥檚 amazing service! So is the mini-fridge man who brought us 5 candy bars every time we asked because we said we liked them! The drinks during the day were never strong. I鈥檓 sure you could ask for more alcohol, but the Coco Locos, Pina Coladas, Majestics, and the such had maybe a shot of rum in them. They were delicious! But you鈥檙e going to have to drink a lot to get a buzz. The night bars were more what we鈥檙e used to in terms of a serving. My husband and I are not beer drinkers, but we enjoyed the Presidente very much.Bring a pool float, it鈥檚 very relaxing to drift in the beautiful pool! We went SCUBA diving with the dive shop and received a very personalized experience (we had never gone diving before). We also went ocean kayaking, but be careful because all of the resorts look the same once you鈥檙e floating out in the ocean. We tried to turn our kayak into the wrong resort and they turned us away, so we were floundering out in the ocean trying to climb back into the kayak!Our maid was very attentive, but was unpredictable. You never knew when she鈥檇 show up. The shampoo and conditioner was fabulous for a hotel supplied brand, and one little bottle usually lasted me through 4 or 5 washings! It didn鈥檛 matter, the maid replaced everything faster than we could use it.The week went by too fast, and I know that if I ever need a relaxing, rejuvenating vacation that I can just skip back to the Majestic. Our on-site rep worked our departure, and everyone was on time. We met no one during our week who worked on 鈥淒ominican鈥?time! We were ready for the laid back lifestyle, but everything was done super fast! The Punta Cana airport is adorable, and the fans kept the air moving so that you didn鈥檛 mind the heat of the open air design.Some tips: Yes, the pillows are horrible. We brought our own, and thought it was one of the smartest things we could have done. The activities around the pool are similar every day which is great if you like structure, but if you want to participate in everything this might get repetitive. We did have little tiny ants in our room anytime we had fruit around. The fruit tray they delivered on our arrival day and occasional garnishes from our fruity drinks seemed to attract them. As long as we were responsible about our garbage, this wasn鈥檛 a problem.All and all, one of the best vacations of my adult life. An absolutely romantic honeymoon spot, and a perfect place to get married! I would not hesitate to recommend this trip to anyone.

<Content>Great Place To Vacation WOW!!What a vacation! bus ride: Stopped at two hotels first. Lots of speed bumps, took about 45 min. from airport to Maj.check in: we booked a colonial junior suite and were told all CJS's had park views. I don't know if this is true. I believe that all category rooms are given out on a first come first serve basis. We were told that the Majestic suite with direct pool access was an upgrade. We took it anyway and enjoyed the pool view and access.rooms: very large, very clean, a/c worked very well, limited privacy in bathrooms except when using the water closet or the very large shower.food: I am not a picky eater and was satisfied. I grew up in New York and have experienced all types of dining. Gourmet it's not. Good food, it is. Buffet was good, Japanese was good and a lot of fun, Mexican was good but not your typical Mexican food.beach: wonderful. White sand, beautiful water, no shells in the water. Very,very few rocks spread far apart in the water. Didn't wear the water shoes I brought. First three days, rough water but a lot of fun. Last three days calmer water.pool: hard to believe! Lots of fun, quiet areas, swim up bar,clean, warm, not too deep and very big.service: very friendly and good service.Don't trust the weather channel, predicted rain every day....never got a drop!All in all, I would go back to Majestic Colonial in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great vacation spot We spent 5 days at the Majestic and loved every moment. We probably will return next year.Our trip to the hotel was a 35 minute ride from the airport and we had no problems registering once we arrived. Our room was great, we had a fantastic view and never encounted any problems either with the maids or refrigerator refills. The food was o.k., but we did not go for the food, we were there for the beach and relaxing. Yes, the breakfast was the best meal, but the dinners at the steakhouse grille and seafood restaurant were good too. The beach was perfect and like a dream, with enough chairs if you were out before 10. The pool was also great, yes it could have been deeper, but we could still swim around. The spa was good and we enjoyed our massages.The staff was PERFECT. we always got our food quickly and also had our drinks, one right after the other! We never had a problem with finding any help. The people involved with the activites were always at the beach and were always tyring to get us up to exercise or to join in an activity.It was a perfect vacation.

<Content>Disappointment I鈥檒l try to keep it short and get straight to the point, since I know that it gets tiring reading long reviews.We have traveled to the Caribbean extensively; all-inclusive places only. Destinations include Riviera Maya, Punta Cana, La Romana, Jamaica (Montego Bay and Negril.)It was 4 of us: 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 10 and 5.)Hotel is 45 min. from the airport, could be more if they stop to drop others off before you.Check-in was fine, smooth. I was able to get a very nice room, close to the beach, on the side adjacent to the pool, 2343, 3rd floor, with essentially a direct ocean view.Hotel is new, opened last December. Rooms, pool, lobby are magnificent. Pool is over 4000ft long, about 4ft deep throughout, with a huge whirlpool area, as well as several kiddie pools.Beach is fine, lots of chairs, but if you want shade, then need to be out there before 8am to reserve.Ocean -- NOT GOOD! Water is way to rough. At times reminded of Jersey shore water. The weather was great, no winds or rain. The reason has to be the physical location of this hotel. It鈥檚 much further up north, relative to other Punta Cana/Bavaro hotels, away from the Caribbean waters and much into the Atlantic ocean. Early morning and late afternoon were better. However, overall this water was unsuitable for us and especially kids.Food 鈥?Mediocre. Notable absence of a wide variety of fruits, Buffet selection is very poor. Same salads every day. (We were at Riu Negril last year; the selection at buffet restaurant was several notches higher.) Steakhouse/Seafood restaurant is not bad, but it won鈥檛 fill you up. Japanese is ok, try it only if Hibachi is a novelty to you, otherwise, skip it. French, didn鈥檛 go (don鈥檛 allow kids under 12), heard very nice reviews though, so go; Caribbean 鈥?didn鈥檛 try.Kids club is a grandiose castle/fortress with water slides and its own pool! But it is completely misplaced and located near the lobby very far away from the beach and the pool. Weird.Entertainment 鈥?usual 鈥?they try hard, but skill level is low. On the positive note, the saxophone player across from the buffet restaurant entrance is a very nice idea!Service 鈥?average. Waiters are slow and tend to skip your table quite often. Bar service is ok, no problems there.To summarize it, the most important factors for us are food and ocean/sea water with both of them being a disappointment. Hence, I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>You'll Love the Majestic Colonial Majestic Colonial Oct 28 through Nov 3, 2006This is one beautiful resort! We booked 6 days through CheapCaribbean and were surprised to find that everything was just as they said it would be including the round trip transportation to and from the resort. The resort staff is courteous, professional and very friendly. Truly the most relaxing vacation we鈥檝e every taken. The grounds are immaculate and beach gorgeous. We were only able to catch 2 of the nightly shows, but both were excellent. If you are a lover of thin crust pizza, you鈥檙e in for a big treat at lunch and dinner every night 鈥?it was awesome! Don't expect top shelf brand booze here, but it's OK - who cares after 3 anyway. All softdrinks are Pepsi brand, you can't get Coke. The pool is the largest and most awesome I've ever seen - and at night it is spectacular. There are activities continously at the beach and pool from late morning until 6 every night - you won't get bored. They do not offer sail boarding or kite surfing, which was all I was interested in doing other than relaxing.Advice:First of all be sure to bring a pair of long pants are they are required to get into the better restaurants that require a reservation. We did not know this and reviewing of all our documentation it was never mentioned. Being from Florida we were surprised because we can go to the finest restaurants in dress shorts here 鈥?didn鈥檛 seem to surprise anyone else so it must be a Florida thing. Next, there were no bugs so forget the bug repellent spray, but bring plenty of sunscreen 鈥?you can get burned (even in November) just staying in the shade! Giving your bartenders a buck tip every now and then will go a long way towards exceptional drink service 鈥?the Europeans won鈥檛 like it, but that鈥檚 their problem. This is a third world country so part with a few bucks on sheer principal. Bring your own insulated mugs for drinks, around the pool, as everything is served in 6 oz. plastic cups. The shops, inside the resort are way overpriced, so go to the ones just outside the gate where you can barter. Speaking just very basic Spanish will also go along way though you can probably get by without a single word of it. Lastly, the buffets were always cold for the first 4 days, after that everything was warm to hot 鈥?guess someone must have gotten the staff to pay closer attention to keeping the Sternos lit. That just made the place that much better.

<Content>Pleasant experience We just returned Oct 31st from a 5D4N at the Majestic Colonial. This resort is about 10 months old, so everything is quite new here. The accomodations were spacious and the setting is quite lovely. The pool is an enourmous serpentine lagoon style and is very clean. With the pool constructed as it is you never need to feel crowded. The workers were all pleasant and tried very hard to please. Small tips are always appreciated but you never feel that they are in any way expected. The food was good, you can basically eat 24-7 and they had a nice selection as well as quite a number of places to eat for dinner. I did find that the breakfast buffet food had gone cold late one morning but that was easily rectified by having one of the station chefs cook up some eggs for me on the spot. I would give this resort a very solid 4-stars. In our opinion the one thing that truly keeps this resort from achieving a 5-star rating is the workmanship and repairs. The original workmanship is not always of the highest quality, and with only 10 months of use the wear and tear is starting to show a bit. This resort needs to employ a crew to keep up with the maintainence repairs as they happen. At a true 5-star you do not see the flaws because they are fixed! Would I return? Absolutely!

<Content>Great, but not perfect I stayed at the Majestic Colonial based on the reviews I read prior to booking. It was rated the 2nd highest in this area of Punta Cana, and quite frankly, I was surprised after only a couple of days. A few comments: Food - the fresh food was great, but any cooked starch or veggie was way too salty (I don't eat meat or fish, so will not comment on either), and I could not eat my meal at the Japanese a la Carte. I looked like a blowfish all week, and could not get enough water in me to wash out that salt - even my morning oatmeal was salty, I had to cut it with fresh dates. Staff - lobby staff was not helpful the three times I had dealings with them. In fact, upon arrival, I waited 4 hours for a room that I did not book. When I told them so, after 30 minutes, they begrudgingly switched my room, still not as booked, but I wasn't going to change it again. The daytime activities are the same day after day, so if you choose the same spot daily, you'll hear and see the same thing. The fitness staff was non-existent even though the board indicated different activities daily - didn't happen. The rooms - pretty good, but strange open layout if guests are around. Just bring a pillow for a good night's sleep. The chambermaids just chatted amongst themselves, and though I was in the room twice upon their arrival, they did not thank me for the gifts they found on the bed. The mini-bar staff on the other hand were fabulous - I told them only once that I drink the water but not the soda, and my mini-bar was refreshed fully with only water. The grounds and inside stairwells were incredibly slippery after rainfall, very dangerous, and the pool area was very pebbly and rough to walk on barefoot. Lots of bugs, but that's probably because of the 'lakes' and waterfalls, which were dirty, smelly, loud when being cleaned and had pumps and vacuums the whole week, so really, what was the point if they have to keep servicing them on a daily basis? It took away from what should have been a very serene and clean environment. The groundskeepers work incredibly hard in my opinion, and still could not keep up with the mess that my fellow tourists from around the globe created. I was shocked to find piles of cigarettes butts on the grounds, inside and out, where ashtrays abound. Water bottles and empty cig packs were strewn around the perimeter of the grounds. Why would tourists do this? I could not walk around the pool barefoot since I would have stepped on a couple of lit cigs. This is very inconsiderate and disrespectful, but not the fault of the resort. By DR standards, this resort is certainly a 4, but definitely not the perfect 5 star that some have given it. I won't return to this particular resort when I go back to Punta Cana.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation It's taken a long time to write my review.... only for lack of time. So, short and sweet.... it just doesn't get any better. We are a mid 40's couple that went to the Majestic the first week of August '06 and had a wonderful time, met great people (both employees of the resort and vacationers like us), and would go back in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great Honeymoon We stayed at this resort from September 25-30. Here is a breakdown of everything, some of which you have read before and some is new.WEATHER: Awesome! About 10 days before, there was a hurricane close by, but it went north and missed it comepletely. Weather.com is very wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It said 60% chance of thunderstorms everyday! When we got there it was raining, but we did not care, it was 6pm. we ate and then stayed in the room. Tuesday night was an awfully loud storm, but no rain, strange. Everyday was beautiful, hot, but with a cool breeze all the time. There was rain all night I think Thursday night, but it did not start till about 10pm. No rain during the day though. It was great!1. POOL: Fabulous! It is long and great not too cold not too warm, doesnot smell like strong clorine, seems very fresh and very clean (except at the end). The entertainment at the pool is loud, but it is only for a little while at different intervals in the day. If you go past the barrier and go on down, you can get away from everyone and pretty much be by yourself. Only one complaint I had about the pool: IT CLOSES AT 6PM!!!!!!!!!!! What the heck!?!?!? We had a georgeous pool view room, it is all lit up and pretty, but you cannot get in it after 6pm!2. ROOM: Loved it! They are nice and big, lots of storage areas for stuff, and a safe to put valuables in. Large tub in the middle next to the bed was very nice. It had a large shower also. I do not recommend it for friends traveling or families. Like everyone said, the toilet area is very small and has a frosted glass door. You can hear and smell stuff when someone is in there. It didnt bother us much though. Same with the shower, it is frosted glass door. Cant really see through them, but you can make out that someone is in there. Bed was kinda hard, pillows suck. We meant to bring our own but forgot. They filled our fridge everyday with anything that we drank. 3. BEACH: Beautiful! Waves were good, nice and big. Some rocky areas in water, just move over a little. Saw some small fish swimming around, nothing big. We got a kayak for a little, that will tire you out quick. Not a problem getting chairs. There seemed to be more people around the water sports area, which not sure why because it was rocky there on the beach. Be prepared to see some breasts, people are not shy at all. And men in thongs. If you bring kids and they are not used to this, keep them at the pool.4. FOOD: Food was great. Never had a problem with the food at all. The first night we did the steak house. It was ok. Mine was not quite done enough, but flavor was good. The best thing were the hot wings at the beginning. They were awesome. Seafood was good also, got the lobster and it was delicous. Japanese steak house was ok, I did not like it much but my husband did. Gourmet was good, small portions though. Went to the buttet after for more desert. One night they had a party, so the restaruants were closed and it was a large buffet set up in the open air restaruant, that was good. We didnot get sick at all but brough gas-x and pepto with us, also imodium. Took a couple of gas-x one night but that was it. Oh, yeah and sometimes the water smelled fishy, I would get something else if it smelled bad.5.EXCURSIONS: Ours was through gogo tours, and the guy there was very nice, spoke english well. We went on the Catamaran sail to Saona Isle. I have always wanted to do it. Word of advise: Our resort is the last one, which means that it is the first to be picked up and the last to be dropped off. The picked us up before breakfast started, and we went to the next resort, and the next one and the next one and picked up people at bus stops and at the tour places from other resorts. Took about 3 hours on a bus. Then the hour and a half sail to a beach. Not an island, a beach. there were broken coral and shells all along the bottom of the water and lots of seaweed. We ate lunch, which was ok, and sat. and sat. and sat. Nothing to do. It was not the prettiest place and there was nothing to do. Then the speedboat back and they take you to a natural beach It was a shallow area in the middle of the ocean! Hello Shark Feeding Grounds!!!!!!!!! Ok we did not see anything but still. Oh, yeah, I do not recommend the sail unless you are young, and can speak and understand Spanish. Lots of music in spanish and a guy with a video camera that will tell you things in spanish, if you dont' understand him, he will ignore you. 6. LANGUAGE: We did not have a problem at the resort. The animation crew knew both so if they approach you and you say you don't speak Spanish they know lots of languages, that is not your excuse! It is kinda funny to watch people use it though. We dont know any spanish, but it did not matter. We didnt come to make friends, so if you are wanting to socialisze with people, Americans are few and far between. Money was not a problem either, we did not exchange and had no problems with dollars. We didnot tip anyone and everything was fine. We may have gotten a towel made up into an animal if we did though, oh well. A couple of more tips, bring lots of sunscreen. We bought a bottle before we left, but had others at home. They did not make it into the bags and we had to buy some. $18-25 for a bottle there. We did not go outside with out sunscreen, and thus we did not burn. Don't lay out your first couple of days, you will get lots of sun there so wait to lay out for color your last days. We saw a lot of people get VERY burnt and I am sure miserable. Bring a waterproof disposable camera, or a couple. If you go to the beach or go on a snorkle trip or any excursion, you are not gonna want to take your expensive digital camera. Get cheap sunglasses. My husband lost his RayBans in the ocean. Make sure your connecting flight back is at least 2 hours from when you get there. we landed in miami, and had to get our luggage (which took forever), go through customs with it, had to have it all checked out, recheck it back in, go though lines, and then find our gate. Our layover was not very long and we were scared to miss our flight. Luckily it was pushed back an extra 30 minutes so that we could eat something. Also, don't wrap anything up too tight. We brought back a couple of glass and stone items, and had to unwrap them and try to get them wrapped back up.I hope this helps. If you are going on your honeymoon, it will be perfect. We definetely will go back here again.

<Content>Our first and definitely not last trip to Majestic! We absolutely loved our week at the Majestic. It was beautiful, tropical, and luxurious. We even went at the height of hurricane season and the weather was perfect. It was sunny all day and a heavy tropical rain came in every night. The staff was great, food okay, and grounds/beach wonderful. We highly recommend this place. We are already planning our next trip back.Rooms: This hotel is brand new (Dec 2005) and our room was in perfect condition and super clean. The room reminded us of when we stayed in the Venetian in Las Vegas. Our room looked over the pool, which is lit up beautifully at night, and we could even see the ocean from our standard room. As stated in an earlier post, there is no handle to open the sliding glass door once you are on your patio, so make sure you leave it open a crack when you are out there. We did not tip which did not seem to be a problem (although maybe that鈥檚 why other rooms got towel animals and we did not! lol).Grounds: I agree with an earlier post that the resort will look even more beautiful when the foliage has grown larger, but it is really beautiful as it is. There are ponds with fountains everywhere that they are thoughtful enough to turn off at night so the noise doesn鈥檛 bother, and they kept he grounds immaculate! Every morning there are people sweeping the bottom of the fountains, gardening, etc.Pool/Beach: Can鈥檛 say enough about the pool. I could spend all day on the shallow shelf. Maybe take a break to get a drink at the swim-up bar or walk the length of the pool (drink in hand) since the whole thing is 3鈥?鈥?deep from end to end. The ocean is clear, warm and turquoise blue. We went through almost an entire bottle of sunscreen.As stated in previous posts, yes, there are a lot of topless women of all ages, shapes, and sizes: mostly at the beach, but also at the pool area. It鈥檚 not in bad taste since for them it鈥檚 completely normal 鈥?not done to flaunt or anything. My husband loved it and I even tried to act European for a day!Activities: We did not pay for any of the extra activities but decided to enjoy the included ones. The snorkeling, although certainly not the Red Sea, is good even in the swimming area. We heard that the paid trip is no better. The pool activities can be lots of fun. You can choose to join in, watch, or stay in one of the quieter parts of the pool. We played pool volleyball, water polo, aerobics (beach and pool), dance lessons, played throw the ball in the hole, drinking games, etc. You meet people from all other the world. Animation (the group of activities staff that keep everyone rallied) is tons of fun. Nelson, Sandy, Felix, Julie, and the rest are happy, nice, fun people that make sure everyone has a good time. They even dance with the guests in the disco at night. Thanks!Food: We can and have put up with just about anything as far as food during our previous travels so we are okay with anything. For people who like good food 鈥?I mean good as in gourmet 鈥?you will hate the food here. On that level, it is terrible. And the wine, forget it! You do have the option of purchasing better wine though. But for those with standard food tastes, you will be quite happy. The variety for every meal is incredible and diversity in the restaurants is great. I am vegetarian and it was sort of difficult. I鈥檓 sure I ended up eating chicken stock more than once, which I would never normally do. They don鈥檛 understand vegetarian at all so even if you tell them in Spanish, don鈥檛 get your hopes up. There are options, but you won鈥檛 get nearly the food selection of your fellow meat-lovers. The pasta bar and omelet bar were the favorites. Tip: if you do dinner at the main buffet in the front, get some fresh blue cheese from the cheese station and maybe even some artichoke hearts or whatever else you like, and have the guy at the pasta bar add it to your made-to-order pasta dish. Favorite meals included lobster at the Gourmet and sushi at the Asian restaurant. Tip: they do not tell you anywhere, but you can eat at the Asian restaurant without reservations whenever you want. It鈥檚 only if you want to sit in the back w/ the Benihana-style chef that requires reservations (that meal is also very good). As far as getting sick, well, we made many trips to the bathroom, but never felt ill so it wasn鈥檛 a problem.Service: I am a service snob. I could not find any flaw in the service in any aspect of this resort. The room was clean, the staff everywhere friendly and at your service the second you walk up, the restaurant staff (wait, bus, and cooks) really on top of it, etc. Language: Most of the staff seemed to speak at least some English, but we really didn鈥檛 know since we tried to speak Spanish as much as we could. We were in a Spanish speaking country after all and the gall some people have to expect them to speak English is just beyond me. The pool activities are all done in multiple languages.Miscellaneous: There is an ATM in the lobby that seems to run out of money quite often. The Internet is fast and costs $5 US 陆 hour, $8/hour, which can be spread out as you wish. You can get slightly better prices on souvenirs if you exit the hotel and go to the shopping plaza just outside the entrance. Make sure to haggle! Negatives: Not much at all. The pool closes at 6pm, which is nice so there is not a lot of noise in the hotel rooms, but it would be nice if it stayed open a little later. There is no drink service at the pool or the beach. It鈥檚 not a big deal since the bars are close, but don鈥檛 expect a cabana boy.About Us: This was our first trip to an all-inclusive, so we really don鈥檛 have anything to compare to other than other 鈥榥ormal鈥?luxury hotels we have stayed in. We normally do budget travel but have certainly stayed in and worked in our share of 4 and 5 star hotels/restaurants. So although we don鈥檛 mind staying in run-down places, we sure know what is expected of a luxury establishment.

<Content>Very relaxing holiday at the Majestic I arrived at about 9:30 pm sept 23rd and was met by Mike (he never stops working) and while I was checking in enjoyed a delicious Majestic 鈥?no rum. Check in was so speedy I didn鈥檛 even have time to finish my drink before the porter was wheeling my suitcase off to the room. The resort is remarkably easy to find your way around 鈥?everything flows down to the beach from the main building. The buildings are either three or four stories and there are several elevators in each building. My room was on the third floor of a three-story building and had a vaulted ceiling that made the room look even bigger. I was pleasantly surprised with a bottle of Dominican champagne and several glasses when I got to the room and since I was traveling on my own 鈥?more for me!! The room itself was well lit and there were jacks for internet connections and several wall plugs. I had a ceiling fan and air conditioning that was very quiet and could be adjusted in the room. The balcony off the room was a good size and had a table and chairs and plenty of room for air mattresses or pool gear. My room overlooked the pool and at night it is a breathtaking view with all the water and lights. It was fairly close to the area where the animation team do the games etc for the pool people but with the door closed 鈥?it did lock 鈥?I couldn鈥檛 hear anything.The bathroom area had a large wall mirror plus a wall mounted pullout makeup mirror; the regulation complimentary shampoo, conditioner, soap, bathing cap, sewing kit, and comb; a blow dryer and separate wall plug for razor or curling iron. There were two sinks and four drawers so you could put all your toiletries away. The walk-in shower stall was very large and the toilet was in a smaller area. The doors are frosted glass so you can鈥檛 really see in and they go almost to the floor and have a space at the top and were more private than I had expected from what I鈥檇 read in the forum. The Jacuzzi bathtub was great but you have to plan ahead as it鈥檚 so large it takes a while to fill. Lack of hot water was never an issue.The storage area was a closet with approx 15 hangers and four large deep shelves. More than enough for me and I was there for two weeks. In this area there was an iron and ironing board, the mini fridge and a coffee maker with supplies. In the mini fridge there were several Presidentes, diet and regular pop and bottled water and a couple of chocolate bars.The bed was a king-sized bed and I also had a sofa, desk and chair, bedside tables and an area to set your suitcase. The room was immaculate and there were plenty of towels. If not having a facecloth can upset you, take one with you as they don鈥檛 have them. The maids were wonderful and cleaned the whole room every day, changed the bedding as needed and brought in more towels. A separate person brought the mini fridge supplies around every day and recognized what you were drinking and stocked more of that product. The only negative thing I found at the resort was the pillows 鈥?they can only be described as king-size airplane pillows. When I mentioned this, I was told that new pillows had been ordered and I could expect something quite a bit better on my next visit. The outside walkways and stairwells are well lit and very clean. I never saw a cigarette butt or any litter anywhere on the resort 鈥?it was cleaner than Disney world! They even have a fellow who goes around every day and sweeps the ceilings outside so you never see a cobweb or evidence of a bug. I didn鈥檛 encounter a single mosquito while I was there but I did get bitten/stung by a wasp while I was off the resort. Although the resort is less than a year old the gardens are already beautiful and when they are fully grown will be magnificent. The plantings have obviously been well thought out and the gardeners are always at work. If you get a chance, walk on the grass it鈥檚 quite different than ours but very thick and springy. What鈥檚 very nice at this resort is there are extra touches, sculptures and whimsical birds are what you can easily see but there are some lovely tableaux tucked away in unusual spots. There are also several ponds with fountains as well as the large pool surrounding the main building so you always hear water. If you want some 鈥渏ungle鈥?walk along the service road on the Principe side and you鈥檝e got it.The pool is huge, clean, and because it鈥檚 fairly shallow, is always warm. There are plenty of chairs and palapyas at both and on the beach and the pool is so large you can choose the sort of area you like 鈥?quiet areas are in abundance but if you like it busier there is the area around the bar where the animation team spends the day. The animation team are also on the beach and have a program of volleyball, exercise and games there. The animation team were great 鈥?Blackie and Nelson in particular always remembered my name and said hello whenever I saw them and I never once Taki Taki鈥檇 or participated in a game. There was no problem with languages. While I was there I heard them speaking German, Italian, English, French, Polish and Portuguese. I鈥檓 not even going to go on about the beach, it is simply awesome. Clean, white sand, no rocks, no seaweed or seagrass 鈥?it just doesn鈥檛 get any better.The kids club looked like a lot of fun .. waterslides and a pool were out in front and I didn鈥檛 hear any kids complaining when they had to go there. The disco and casino and gym were right across the way and seemed very popular. I only went to the disco a couple of times but the animation team were always there if you wanted to dance. I didn鈥檛 go to the casino and I didn鈥檛 go to any of the shows so I can鈥檛 comment on them but I can say the theatre was the best I鈥檝e seen on a resort 鈥?big comfy chairs set up in little groups 鈥?or however you wanted them, and small tables for your drinks. There were some pretty buff bodies in the gym so the equipment must have been okay - I have to admit I didn't do anything more than look in the door.The food was excellent (and I live with a chef so I鈥檓 pretty picky). I ate most meals at either the buffet or at the beach restaurants and never once encountered anything that I had second thoughts about eating. The Japanese and French restaurants are the only places requiring reservations and that was easy to do by simply going to the guest services area in the lobby. The bars were great fun! Freddy at the lobby bar makes the best drinks 鈥?try his frozen amaretto sour; Lidio at the lobby bar was very patient with us as we practiced our Spanish on him and we were never without a drink; Ernesto at the pool bar kept me supplied with coffee and water all day and occasionally entertained as he danced with the animation team. As someone described the bars, they are kind of bunkers surrounded by a bar 鈥?if you like to keep track of everything going on, simply sit at a corner and you won鈥檛 have a problem. The bars were all stainless steel and spotless 鈥?tongs were kept in an antiseptic solution and all the squishy machines were totally cleaned out each day.The service at the resort was the best I've had at an AI. Most of the staff spoke enough English for them to understand me and they always met you with a smile and a hello. Every single member of the staff I encountered was pleasant and helpful - especially nice when you are travelling alone.The resort was terrific - relaxing to the max and I'm going back in April - need I say more!

<Content>Overall, an enjoyable stay My wife and I and one other couple just got back from the Majestic recently and had a very enjoyable time. Like others, we did a lot of research and picked the Majestic from overall positive reviews. We were not disappointed. The pool and beach are as described. Rooms are large and well appointed. There is a slight musty odor upon entering your room, but I imagine that you will experience that at most all resorts in this type of climate. A little incense took care of it in no time.Food overall was above average with a wide variety of selections at the buffets. Our favorites were the Dominion/Mexican and Chinese/Japanese restaurants. Chicken dishes were excellent and meat and fish dishes fair. 3 of the 4 of us did have mild intestial distress, but nothing that prevented us from enjoying our stay.Staff was pleasant and accomodating. The resort does have more Europeans than Noth Americans, so if you have to have the majority of people around you speaking English, or topless sun bathing is offensive, this resort might not be for you. Neither of these were a problem for us! For English speaking guests, Mike at Guest Services will assist you in any way. He was great!We paid extra for a Jr. Suite Majestic Pool room. This is a 1st floor room with a patio that walks-out to the pool and has an outdoor jacuzzi. Not unless direct pool access is important to you, I don't think its worth the extra $, as all rooms are nice and the indoor jacuzzi found in all the rooms is better than the outdoor one. We've been to Secrets Capri in Playa del Carmen and to Couples in Ochos Rios and, although each has something special about it, the Majestic got 5 stars for their beach and pool!The Dominican all-inclusive experience, particularily at the Majestic, offers you a nice overall vacation and for the price we considered it an excellent value.

<Content>Just What We Needed! Boy, was I in need of a vacation! This was our 4th time to the islands but usually we go in the winter. The weather was great with a few thunderstorms at night to keep me entertained.As for the resort, simply wonderful. Good food. Better than we have had at any resort. The service was always with a smile. Both my wife and I had a great time with all of the staff. Freddy is the bartender I will always remember for his mystery drinks!The Canadian guy in guest services named Mike was great with his knowledge of the resort and the area around. He was always on the go. We saw him everywhere. I must also mention Angela who is in guest services as well. My wife would make a special trip just to say hello! Our maid was always there with a smile and a ola. At night the shows were pretty good, but sometimes the music was too loud for our rural ears. The beach party was great fun.Only went on one excursion to see the countryside. I have a new respect for farming in Canada. We have it easy!We would recommend this place to all of our friends.Thank you Majestic

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic! We have just returned from the Dominican Republic after staying at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana for 2 weeks.All we can say about this hotel is it is absolutely fantastic! Everything about the hotel was great. The friendly service, the food, the facilities and the room were all 'top notch'.We didnt want to come home and are already thinking about going back again next year, maybe for 3 weeks instead of 2.The only, (minor), moans we have are that we felt that there could be more english speaking staff and that the disco/games bar could have been advertised better. (Its sort of out of the way).We struggled a little with the Spanish language, but intend to learn more when we go next. Having said that, there is a guy there, 'Majestic Mike', who is from Canada and a really helpful and knowledgeable guy. Seek him out if you go and he will give you invaluable tips about the local and national areas, plus of course, the hotel itself.All in all, a fantastic hotel and a great holiday!!

<Content>Kids Club This year we have been to the Majestic Hotel in Punta Cana, the stay was very pleasant, but apart from the hotel itself, the beach and the food which were great, for me as a mother the best part was the Kid's Club. I have been to several hotels in the Caribbian and in Dominican Republic and I can say that this kid's Club was one of the best. The person in charge Maggy, Maria Victoria Montero was very professional and kind to the kids which made our stay at the hotel even better. Muchas gracias por todo Maggy!.Julia

<Content>Great resort except for the restaurants My wife and I stayed sept. 2 thru 9. We are in our mid 20's and 30's. I don't speak Spanish and my wife knows just a little. We've been to the caribbean on a cruise and visited several islands, and stayed at an all inclusive in the riviera maya. I read most of the reviews good and bad and thank you for those. I always keep an open mind but also like to be prepared.Arrived at punta cana airport and purchased the $10 dollar cards, fast thru customs, avoided the bag grabbers that want a couple bucks for carrying your luggage 15 feet and went right to one of the tourist companies set up there. I had only bought airfare and hotel, so i needed a taxi or a transfer to hotel. There seems to be a set fee of $30 dollars per couple for a one way transfer in air conditioned mini bus. So if you need a tranfer to a hotel, after customs, just go right to one of the tour companies there, I happened to go to funjet vacations. Bus ride was wild and fun, similar to driving in Italy but with pot holes and speed bumps. Arrived at hotel after 40 minute ride, no wait at desk, guy spoke decent english, got a couple drinks and right to room. Here's where I noticed a problem right away but still kept an open mind. I had asked for a top floor room but got a second story room. From other reviewers as well from past experience, noise from above can be a problem, plus tile floors echo sound. Now for all those that seem to complain about every little detail to the front desk and try to get a better room, well i thought about it. The reviewers who did, seem to do better later. I decided not to complain, i saw positives - the room was on the end of building, so only 3, not 4 neighbors and it was in the middle of the resort convenient to everything. Fortunetly neighbors above were fairly quiet. But when furniture is moved, sounds like someone is vacuuming in your room, very loud.ok, for the room, exactly as expected, very large, jetted tub in middle of room with two sink bathroom, small toilet area and very large shower. no problem with water pressure. bed was comfortable for me and my wife. pillows are long and thin. i rolled my second one up for double support. tv has variety of channels for when you get food poisoning and can't concentrate to read. mini bar always stocked every day. maid came 4 days at 3 pm and 3 days at 10 am. no problem with service and always pleased. she even sprayed air freshener three days because in afternoon, we did get a musty smell from a/c. It smelled like heavy smoke and i tended to turn the a/c off in the afternoon or make sure i wasn't in the room then. smell sometimes came thru mid morning and late at night. Don't know if they have a problem with ventilation system as it may be smokers in some rooms sharing smoke with non smokers in other rooms. I never noticed the smoke when it was time to eat. why would i be in the room when its time to eat - food poisoning.restaurants: breakfast selection is excellent, lunch selection is good. Buffet dinner was best dinner meal we had besides gourmet. Steak restaurant had same food as buffet. caribbean restaurant was bad except their buffet selection was ok. The beef and chicken we got in our burritos and fajita's was tough and inedible. We took a couple bites and left. The following day, I was stuck in my room for 2 days with no appetite and very weak. Luckily i didn't throw up but did get diarreha (however its spelled) after i got my strength back and was able to eat again. Both my wife and i still have it but its finally getting better now that we are back in states. So she ate at buffet when i did not eat. We missed the fish and oriental restaurant. We did manage to eat at the gourmet the last night there and that was very nice. We both had chicken soup, filet mignon and chocolate cake. All very good. Gourmet was only one we would recommend though you are only allowed one visit a week. You can be carefull all you want when eating but you never know when the food will get you sick. My wife and I watched carefully what we chose, ate a yogurt a day, and yet we both got sick. We did see other people actually throw up at the restaurants but that was rare. Not much you can do but get better and enjoy the time you still have. We never got sick in the Riviera Maya. the resort: fantastic!!! pool is long and has activities most of the time or has its quiet places. bars all over the place. try the cooc loco or the majestic drinks. beach is very nice though swimming area is not that far into water. you do have to be carefull of rocks. plenty of chairs. kayaks and windsurfing. no pedal boats though which was disapointing. More up to date people there, so fewer tops. If you don't want to see breasts and ---, don't go to the beach anywhere. In other words, some of the men i saw out did the women in size. So get over the sexism thing people have in america and either allow all to go topless and none at all. spa was very good. Its good to know spanish but you can get by without it. Its polite to llearn a few common phrases and use them. Take the spanish lessons while you are there, it helps. Service was always very good. checking out was easy, taxis are waiting at hotel and are $30 per couple. At airport, you get passport stamped to leave, then switch lines to go thru security. not much direction so be careful you do it in that order. no a/c at airport and normal wait to get through security, so be aware. drink water before security.Overall a very nice resort. If it wasn't for the food poisoning and the restaurant food choices, I would go back to this resort. Activities, beach, pool, resort are great. food and bathroom stall not so great.

<Content>Very Very Nice Gonna keep it short .. This place was great. The restaurants-The Pool ( our favorite ) The Beach ( Unbelievable ) The staff were so-so We originally spent the first 4 day of our 8 day stay in Punta Cana at Secrets Excellence ( for couples only ) and I couldn't help to compare the two .. but this place was beautiful. It's only about 4 or 5 months old and everything was brand new. The only thing I didn't like was the entertainment staff getting in your face about joining their activities .. I mean, I'm on vacation - I want to relax. I know they have a job to do but if I'm sleeping on the beach please don't wake me up to join some half[]game. Take advantage of everything - Enjoy Enjoy Enjoy. It was breath taking.

<Content>Loved the Majestic We went to the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana for a week because our travel agent gave us such a good review of this hotel. It was a big coincidence that she just returned the week before we went to ask for advice about a good hotel in Punta Cana and she told us about The Majestic. Everything there was excelent. The food, room service, personnel at the reception area and everybody in all restaurants. Something that called my attention was the animation team and all the different activities those guys have day and night. I've been in different places in the past but I never found so much to do that you're not going to get bored. My gratitude and recognition to a job well done to Nelson, Blakie, Felix and the rest of members from the animation team. I just hope I can see you again very soon. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

<Content>Place is truly majestic!!! My boyfriend and I (both in our mid 20's) went to the MC Aug 31 - Sep. We arrived a few days after Ernesto, but once we arrived you couldn't even tell a hurricane was anywhere near the place! I booked through beachdestinations.com and had no problems with them. I booked a garden room, however, 2 weeks prior to my trip I emailed the hotel requesting a high level room possibly facing the ocean...and I got exactly what I asked for : ) Entering the country was pretty simple and FAST. the rushed us through the $10 tax line and our baggage came out fast. I was worried about everything I read about the baggage handlers grabbing your bags. I said no once, and they let my bf and I carry o ur own bags. All the tour guides are set up outside the airport with signs. It was very easy to fine our tour guide who showed us to our bus. The bus ride was about 25minutes and they drive CRAZY there...make sure to wear your seatbelt! Like others have noted, it is a pretty poor place while driving through the country. When we arrived there was no line to check in and the front desk workers spoke perfect English. foodAs my bf checked in I headed straight to the reservations table. There was no need for me to hurry to the restaurant reservation desk b/c they had several openings. I read reviews of people who stayed for a week and couldn鈥檛 get into the Japanese restaurant....not true! I walked into the Caribbean restaurant, it didn't look good at all and we walked right out...just as many others did. On 2 occasions we stopped into the chinese restaurant just to get some sushi. It wasn鈥檛 as good as some sushi restaurants I鈥檝e been to...more like the sushi you get that supermarket...but still not too bad. I read horror stories about food poisoning, but I had no problems and tried everything at the restaurants. Breakfast was by far my favorite. Delicious crepes, made to order omelets, milk shake bars, mimosas, they would even cut the fruit in fancy shapes right in front of you if you requested. Breakfast is from 7-10..so you cant really sleep in. Lunch is at 1230 and you can eat at either the main buffet or by the beach. My first 2 days I ate at the beach. It was so-so....burgers, hot dogs, and fries. On the 3rd day I discovered the main buffet lunch...much better! I never did the buffets at night, but heard from others it was the same food from lunch served for dinner. Great pasta bar..pick out of pastas, 5 sauces, and about 8 ingredients. We went to the gourmet restaurant once. The place is all about atmosphere. Place was as pretty as any 5star restaurant here in DC. The waiters were very professional and started the meal with a cocktail, then mango cold soup, shrimp salad, lobster entree, and tiramisu dessert. The presentation was beautiful, but like any nice restaurant the portions were tiny. The chinese restaurant was also great. sushi was available buffet style. The had traditional chinese soups, appetizers, and entrees. Huge portions! I tried the steak restaurant, but wasn鈥檛 too impressed. The meats were dry and no sauces were provided. The Japanese restaurant is a MUST! The chef is such a great entertainer. I felt bad for barely making a dent in my food :( but it was soooo much! Everyone had the same thing - shrimp, fried rice, egg rolls, steak, chicken, sea bass! They also brought out sushi and fried ice cream dessert. We tipped about $2 at the a la cart restaurants.BarsThey have drink menus at every bar, so you can see what is included and what cost extra. I was impressed with the included alcohols..something for everyone...beer, vodka, rum, tequilla, etc...all the basics! you will see the same bartenders at every bar day to day..which I liked! I made friends with the guys at the beach bar and they would have my drink ready when I would walk up (pineapple juice w/ vodka ) :) There is literally a bar every 10 feet! Bars are open 24hrs a day! There is no drink service on the beach..but it's only a 30 sec walk to the bar..so I didn't mind at all. Beachwhat can I say....it's perfect! they had people raking the beach every morning and constantly picking up trash. I reserved a chair under the hut before I went to breakfast each morning, but I didn鈥檛 need to. I would come back after breakfast and still it was so empty. They have some solicitors walking around the beach, which did get annoying at times. I was asked at least 3 times a day at the beach if I wanted my hair braided or go to restaurants outside the hotel. There are a bunch of fish that are in the shallow end, so I was glad I brought my snorkel gear. The water is crystal clear and very warm! the waves were gentle and plenty of people outside the roped areas using kayaks and other boats. They are free to use, but you must leave a credit card as a deposit.ServiceI was worried about the language barrier..but not once did I encounter someone who didn't speak basic english. Everyone was nice and always saying hi. I also read on this site about a shortage of do not disturb signs..but again, this was not a problem. I saw plenty everywhere!RoomsPerfect!!! bathrooms are completely open. I would definitely recommend the rooms for couples, since it's open. The bathrooms don't have door that are completely closed- open on the top and bottom. So basically you hear EVERYTHING! I was in the 3rd building (3344)..it was perfect. Ocean view and across from the restaurants. Our room did have the moldy smell, but we brought candles so it was tolerable. The beds are very firm and pillows are so-so. I brought my own pillow, so I was ok 飦?Our power shorted everytime I tried to blowdry my hair on high setting鈥o I gave up on nice hair after day one. I think the walls are pretty thin..I could hear people walk up and down the stairs (our room was right in front of the stairs). We received the bottle of champagne, which was yummy! Our mini was stocked daily with 2 beers, 4 water bottles, pepsi, diet pepsi, sprite, and orange soda.Weatherweather was perfect, despite weather.com's promise of daily rain showers. It wasn;t humid at all, and temps never were too hot to sit in the sun.GroundsBeautiful!! You can tell the place is new, b/c the flowers/plants/trees are small..but give it some time and I can tell this place will be lush! Tons of groundskeepers keeping the place looking beautiful. I never saw trash anywhere!we were so tired from sitting in the sun all day, so we didnt try out the disco or casino. The disco is open to 7am, but I never heard people coming home that late. This is definately a relaxing place and not a party people resort. Most people were young couples, like my bf and I. I saw very few families and older couples. But I did see terrific looking kids pools and playgrounds. The people I spoke with said a lot of people were winning $40-50 (paid out in pesos of course) here and there on the slots at the casino!CheckoutWas a breeze. Checkout is at 12. They held our luggage at 12 and were able to grab some lunch before our bus came at 1 to pick us up. The airport was much MORE hectoc getting out. they went through EVERY carry on bag very carefully...which took forever! It was about 2 hrs to go through the lines and finally reach the hotel gates. Everyone was sweating to death dying for water...finally we got through the lines and water costs $8 at the minimart!!! I guess they want all your money before you leave.Bottom line is the place is great, and you won鈥檛 regret it!

<Content>Excited with Majestic Colonial Just arrived from Majestic Colonial. Have been our greatest experience in Punta Cana. Hotel facilities are super. The animation team(F茅lix, Nelson, Mariel, Julie, Ricky A., Amada, Blackie, Sandy and Chocolate) kept the people in tune. Are great. Service is excellent, good from Yakaira our room service at room 4402. Victor, the bartender at the restaurant level, was extarordinary, and more to say about Jos茅 Mar铆a Alarc贸n at the beach restaurant; his service was fabulous. We are just looking onplanning our next visit to the Majestic.

<Content>Beautiful Majextic Colonial This was our first time to the Caribbean. We met my son's girl friends family there. The place is gorgeous, clean, has friendly staff, has great food and drinks, and we would love to go back sometime. We were told we might get sick from the food and water, but only one day experienced a little upset stomach which could happen anywhere. I wish we knew a little more Spanish, but the staff knew some English too. It was the best relaxing vacation we have ever had. We booked the all-inclusive through cheapcaribbean[-]. I hated to leave the Majestic Colonial. We went the first week of August, 2006. Barb

<Content>Everything you will read is true Everything you will read here is true. The good, the bad and the indifferent. I am glad I did my research because it definately helped our trip. We stayed at the Majestic for 7 nights for our honeymoon and it was everything we were looking for. I can say it wont be for everyone.Listen to what they say about booking the Japanese resturant right when you first get there. It books up fast. We visited all the resturants with no real favorites, but we did get a little bored with breakfast and lunch because there are only the same two places open. The shows are lack luster. We watched a few, but never stayed for the whole thing.The casino was small. Big enough for my husband to win $200! So no real complaints there.The pool is addictive and so beautiful. It really made it worth it! Bring lots of sunscreen, rafts or a frisbee. They are fun and the pool is definately large enough! We felt no need to tip. Everyone wants one, but no one really needs one. We didn't tip housekeeping and we still got our room cleaned. We didn't tip the bartenders and still got good service. We did tip the guy who fills the mini bar and got lots of extras! (Leave it in the fridge or the maid will take it).We brought IM and Pepto and did use it. I would reccomend at least bringing it just in case.It is an open concept which we enjoyed, but can see how it could be problematic for people with preteens-teens. It is also a topless resort and beach. We didn't care, but we also didn't know about it.Don't buy anything on the resort, it is very expensive. You can walk about and hour up the beach and find vendors you can barter with or if you leave the resort enterance there is a flea market to the right where you can also barter. They love giving you gifts to make you feel like you have to buy (necklaces, shots, cigars) they all do it, so dont feel bad about walking away. We had a lot of nice necklaces that we got for free by the end that we heard some americans paid $10 for!!!Finally DO THE BAVARRO RUNNERS. We were so glad we did! They take you to the sugar cane field, cigar factory, to a typical dominican home where you get to see a cock fight (only for a minute and not a real one, you can also purchase coffee, cinnamon, chocolate and vanilla for $5), and finally a ranch where you eat lunch and ride horses on the beach. We loved it. Definately our favorite part. We also did the Saona Island. This is a LONG day. Very beautiful and fun, but wouldnt suggest it as the only excusion you do all week.All is all it was everything we wanted and expected. Everything you will read in here is pretty much true, but if you are prepared there is nothing to complain about. Keep in mind we have nothing to compare it to and aren't the kind of people to complain about them working on the elevator or painting a wall. We make our own good time. We would go again, but not for a long time, there are to many other places we want to see first.PS We were also told by another guy there that when him and his wife took the long walk up the beach they stopped at other resorts and ate and drank along the way. We weren't so daring, but it sounded like fun.

<Content>Best Vacation by far We stayed at the Majestic from July 23rd to August 6th. Two weeks of absolute fun and enjoyment. Beautiful hotel, lobby area, pool, beach, very well kept and new. Our trips' focus was for our family of five to have a good time and especially my daughter, since this was mostly for her 15th birthday. My parents met up with us for our second week stay (they also had a great time). We had been in Punta Cana twice before and had positve experiences but this by far exceeded our expectations. We traveled my husband and I and three children, ages 15, 14 and 10. From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with their Majestic drink, which is a fruity type of drink. The people working at the front desk were very helpful and gave us our rooms right away. We stayed in rooms 4322, 4323 and 4324. (The girl that made our rooms was nice and very accomodating.) Very nice rooms with partial view of the beach and very quite at night time. The food at the hotel was very good. I loved the breakfast buffet, with a wide variety of choices, omelletes, crepes, cereals, fruits, churros, breads, natural juices and the best outmeal and hot chocolate. There are two lunch buffet one in the main dining roon and the other by the beach area, also very good. At night there is a little of everything. You have the Japanese Restaurant which needs reservations, the Chinese which is right next to the Japanese, no reservations for this one. The Gourmet which has an excellent filet mignon. Here we sang happy birthday to my daughter, they turned off the lights and came out with drums and singing happy birthday to a dominican beat. The Caribbean restaurant has a wide variety of dominican dishes and especially liked the red beans. The two beach restaurants are also very good.The beach is beautiful, crystal clear water and clean sand without rocks or shells that bother your feet. The pool is amazing very clean and large. The pool area has enough chairs to go around and is divided into several areas. If you are looking for some quite time to read or just relax, then the pool area near the dining room is ideal for you. If you are looking to have fun, hear music, do aerobics and play games, then the pool area by the wet bar is for you. As well as the beach has the quite side and the fun side which has the same things as games, dancing lessons, etc. The nightly shows are fun and the most see, is The Michael Jackson Show. There is also an excellent nightly saxophone player by the pool area.The best part of the trip was the entertainment group. They work very hard to make your trip enjoyable. They took that extra time to make sure my children had fun especially my daughter. We will always remember them, Ricky Ahh for your funny ways, Felix the cat, Vladi, Juli, Jose, Gregory, Yismel, Jennifer and last but not least is Sandy (thank you for your advices) and Amada (thank you for being like a sister to my daughter). We love you guys and hope to see you soon, again at the Majestic.......Betty, Ernie, Sr., Ernie Jr., Cristina, Bertha, Miguel and Beatriz from Miami

<Content>Great , Great Real great experience at the Majestic during our 7 nights stay. The hotel is really clean as the rooms . The lobby is really nice and the first impression when you're arriving is that the name of Majectic is well desserved. The check in was quick and drinks were offered to all during the registration. Ask for the hotel guide when checking in , this small guide is very convenient but none of us received the book till we got advised by our tour operator the day after. The room was as expected ( as per the web photos) with a very comfortable king size bed .... but with very thin pillows. The tub/Jacuzzi is nice but as it's positionned right in the middle of the room without any walls it appears not to be so convenient if you're with children. The shower is as big as the restroom is narrow ...and the glass door is not what you are usually expecting for such place ... The overrall feedback was good despite a humidity smell that we didn't succed to kill despite our effort to open doors and windows ...bring some candles. As we were occupying two rooms the strange things was that the other one was not having such smell. The air conditionning was working perfectly and we never had any issue with the temperature during our stay. Regarding the tips we quiet don't understand if they were needed ...we started giving1$ tips and never got the appropriate nb of towels , or bathrobe ...after asking the answer was  in 5 minutes ...but 5 Domincan's minutes are sometime close to 2 hours or longer . Netherless the towels problems we never had to complain about the cleaning and the staff was nice and smilling all the time. We had once a power shortage during 10mm at night and I will recommend to have a torch in the room. The breakfast buffet was awesome with a great variety of dishes , and a dedicated bufftet for fruits where the mango lovers could find a great variety of their favorite fruits. We had some really great breakfast there and tasted some new flavor like Plantin , sugar canne, etc . Looking into some website you are advised to make reservation for two restaurants the Gourmet and the Japaneese one . Dont go to the Gourmet ...the food is really average and the taste is not what we could expect . The lobster tail was not cooked properly and was far better at the seaside restaurant. You could have a better dinner in any of the others ...avoid !!! The japaneese restaurant is separated in two , one need reservation and it 's where we went . It worths the reservation , even if it's not a real japaneese one . The cook was nice and friendly and we enjoy sharing the table with Canadian and Mexican guys. If you want a slot do the reservation the morning after your arrival. We had to wait four days to go there....The two best restaurants are at the front beach . This is a very good buffet for lunch and the place is splitted in two for the dinner. As an advice if you go to the fish space never ask for meat ...and vice versa ...We tried hard and had no chance to got the menu ... Try the tournedo filet and the lobster tail these are really good and tasty . The beach is really fantatstic and clean . You do see staff all the time walking around to keep it as clean as in the morning. What about the water ....awesome , hot and like crystal !!! If you want to see some fishes bring some little pieces of bread and you will be surrounded in five minutes by douzen. If you're lucky then two pelican will fly over you to fish !!!Animation was good with a show every evening , don't miss the Michael jackson show , this the best one. The disco is really small and I will call it more a bar ...they play mainly carribean music and latino , great for a time but I will expect to have more international music . We had two trips out of the hotel : The monster Safari Truck and the Marinarium the best one is the Safari where you could see how the Domincans are living ...big change from our luxury hotel !!! Our guide was named Radi and was really funny and smilly . If you do this trip then carry some pens and paper book that you could give to the school that you will visit. It's not indicated anywhere and believe me , it will bring a lot to the school. You will visit multiple places where small children willl ask you something , again bring small present ( better than $$$) like hats , sweets. The Marinarium was great trip also . You took a boat and do snorkling above the sharks and rays, you then left and go to a natural swiming poool where you have drinks and meringue in the water !!! You will also have a lesson on how to prepare Cocoloco ....with and with gazolina .... A local cigars factory is offering you a free trip to their place from the hotel ...buy cigars nothing else ..you could have better price at the small shopping center right after the exit of the Majestic . Now be prepared to be grabbed and pushed in all shops ...up to you for the negotition . If you pay in $ don't expect to have the change in $ ...or ask to see the change in $ first.

<Content>Excellent value for money We returned from the Majestic last week, and I would like to give my review to Tripadvisor, as the reviews her were very useful in deciding which hotel to go to.First of all, both me and my girlfriend have an education in hotel management and many years of experience in the hotel industry. Secondly, we have travelled extensively around the world, including the Carribean and Dominican Republic, and believe me, we've seen the good, the bad and the ugly! So I hope this review will give an objective picture of what to expect.= the good = ResortThe resort is beautiful! It looks brand new and is well kept. Throughout our stay, we saw gardners, mechanics, painters and cleaners to keep the resort green, pink and clean all day. The rooms are huge, about twice the size you would expect. I believe they all have at least a jacuzzi in the room and a shower that fits 2 persons. The minibar is restocked daily with beer, water and sodadrinks. The large TV has 32 channels, including movie and sports channels, mostly USA channels. One thing I particularly like (although not very environmental friendly) is that you can keep the Airco on all day  night, so it is always 20 degr.C | 68 degr. F in the room. Another thing thing I liked is the large gym, good equipment. If you work out at home, it's worth bringing your gymshoes etc. to the resort to stay in shape a bit.The poolThe pool is excellent. It is very long as it runs over the lenght of the resort. It is clean, lots of grass, flowers, palmtrees etc. around it, and not overcrowded. Plenty of pool beds available, although some French and German guests have the nasty habbit of 'claiming' a bed early in the morning with a towel or single flip-flop and then go back to bed or breakfast.The beachWhat an amazing beach! It ranks high in my top5 of alltime. Again, plenty of beds available under the palmtrees or umbrellas. It is cleaned througout the day. And the best thing: as it is a private beach, you don't have the annoying beach boys trying to sell you trips and fake watches. You can get kayaks, snorkling gear and boogie board free of charge. You can also rent catamarans, go scuba diving and (I can recommend) rent your personal speedboat for an 1-hour trip.The restaurantsPlenty of choice here. I've counted 7 or 8 restaurants, most of them are not bad at all. Our favorites were the Japanese/chinese restaurant (you need to make reservations only for the tepanyaki tables, but the other tables offer excellent food inclusing sushi and sashimi) and the Caribean restaurant, which serves mainly mexican and local Dominican food. And you have to try the lobster in the seafood restaurant at the beach!Shows  entertainmentAs stated by others, the Michael Jackson show is the best one. The other shows vary from good (Latin dance) to horrible (funny gameshows with audience participation is not my thing at all)The daytime games at the beach and pool are not to bad, some of the annimation crew actually have a good sense of humor.= The bad and the ugly = Of course there are also things which could be improved. Service in the restaurants sometimes leaves a bit to be desired, and unfortunately it's mainly the ladies who seem to lack enthousiasm and hospitality attitude. The gourmet restaurant for which you need to make reservations, was the worst of the 8 restaurants. Food quality and quantity was disappointing, and the waiters were nervous, clumsy and unattentive. Kudos however for Reception and housekeeping staff. Tips1. Do not leave the resort unless you have to. Both in the mini-mall just off the resort and in Playa Bavaro you have to run the gauntlet to avoid vendors of cheap souvenirs and fake sigars. They all sell the same stuff and are quite agressive in their approach.2. Do not book the trip to Sanoa Island unless you are prepared to spend 6-7 hours in a bus to a location which is less attractive that the beach at your hotel.. We were warned on Tripadivor, and met people at the resort who did take the trip. They were very dissapointed. 3. If you like cigars: don't buy them in the hotel, it's a rip off (US$30 per cigar!!) Instead, ask the concierge for the tour to the Davidoff factory. It's close by, and I've heard they let you tast the goods before you buy. Be prepared to pay about 4-6 USD per cigar. So, hope this helpes you to make your choice. This is the best all-inclusive resort I've been in, ever. I can recommend it to anyone!.

<Content>Majestic is Fantastic!!! We stayed at the Majestic Colonial at the beginning of August and we had an amazing time. We arrived at the hotel around noon time and had to wait until 2pm to check in, which wasn't a problem since they gave us our wrist bands right away so we were able to enjoy lunch and explore the resort while we waited. We were given a great room, 4413!! Top floor of the fourth building, with two balconies and a view of the ocean! We were truly spoiled!We really enjoyed the sit down restaurants, especially the Japanese and the Steak house. We tried the buffets a few times but weren't really too happy with them.The pool is absolutely to die for!! We spent some time at the beach but spent the majority of the time at the pool. There were always chairs at the beach and the pool no matter what time of day it was. The pool is so large, that you can always find a place to relax and have quiet time if you want or you can join the activities and games near the pool bar. The staff at the Majestic were always kind, polite and helpful! We met a lot of very nice people there and thoroughly enjoyed our time there! We will definitely return to the Majestic!!!

<Content>The Majestic not as Majestic as they want you to believe The majestic colonial is not a 5 star hotel by any standard. I would rate this hotel a 3 star for the following reasons:1) Hotel rooms are not well finished or appear to have proper bath facilities without standing water and flushing toilets.2) The Hotel has and unfinished feeling like it was rushed to be opened.3) The food while not bad was 7-8 on a scale of 10.The positives on the hotel are the Dominican people themselves and beautiful beaches. These people are the hardest working, friendliest and courteous people I've personally meet in a third world country. They are very proud people and it shows with their intelligence and attention to detail. Remeber they can only provide what they have access to regarding amenities. And my times they will exceed your expectations.My advice is to go for the people and beaches and not the hotel Majestic. The Majestic while good has a long way to go before becoming a 5star.Gran Bahia next door is a true 4 star hotel and has better room accomodations but not a great food or staff selection from what I've heard.

<Content>A Perfect Vacation The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and my room was beautiful and well kept. The room was cleaned daily and mini bar restocked. The ladies that clean the room were very friendly.The food was good- I did not have anything that was bad. Yes, some things were better than others鈥?I especially loved the Taino restaurant. The buffets were excellent, offering a wide variety of meal choices.I was warned of bug issues from friends who traveled to the Caribbean often- I brought lots of bug spray but never had to use it. I also had no issues with illness but do bring pepto or something just in case, it is expensive to buy there.I did not experience much of a language barrier at all. As others have said, you are not in the U.S. and their native language is not English. Many of the employees spoke good English. I had a great time trying to speak Spanish and the staff was very patient with me!Speaking of staff, all of the staff is very friendly and hard working and they go out of their way for you- from the housekeeping staff, to Benito at the towel services. They all made my stay that much better. The pool bartender, Ernesto, was the best. He was always ready with my bottle of water or my rum and coke. It is the staff that helped to make my trip so memorable. The entertainment team made sure everyone was having fun and somehow knew everyone鈥檚 names. They were all willing to have a conversation or show me a dance move- you do feel like family by the time you leave. The team has such unbelievable energy and made my stay so much fun. A special thanks to Felix, Blacky, and Tequila for making my experience that much more enjoyable. Thanks also to C茅zar for his friendly support at the gym and teaching me how to play pool. My trip would not have been the same without these people. I am anxiously awaiting an email from my new friends! lmk717@gmail.com

<Content>The Staff was Awesome and entertaining The Majestic Staff was very very good. I thought that the entertainers were very entertaining and nice to everyone. Sandy Animation was friendly and Exorbitant. All of the entertainers were garrulous to all the resortes and enthusiastic for all the activities, i.e. dance lessons, arobics, spanish lessons, and afternoon competitions.I was very impressed with the staff at the Majestic.

<Content>A 'Majestc' 20th Anniversary. Stayed at this breathtaking resort August 5th through 9th. It was our 20th anniversary and I surprised my wife and kids with this trip. We had two rooms side by side, a king suite for us and and Double for the three kids (15, 10, 7). They even put in a extra twin bed for the 3rd child. Let me say I was very aprehensive about booking this trip after reading some of the reviews. However, after visiting the place my self I can attest that some of the bad reviews are by those few that can never be satisfied. Trust me I have been in the hotel business 22 years in the states and there are some folks that you cannot please no matter what you do.The guest rooms are tastefully decorated and are very spacious. We were concerned about the open plan but the shower and tiolet are separate and have frosted glass doors. Also the shower stalls are huge so the kids could actually change in privacy. The a/c was cold some times too cold. We had to turn it up. The view from balconey was exquiste. At night you could sit out and enjoy the jazz (saxophone) playing from the live solo artist. The resort is only 7 months old. While there are minor issues with the finish it will NOT effect the guest experience. The service was great. Like others have said you are in a spanish speaking country get a clue! With that said the staff was eager to please (always smiling) and would speak to you in english or find some that did. The predominately European guest were great. We had no problems befriending them. I even joined some for volley ball in the pool. There were 4 french, five spanish and one (me) american (of asian ) decent and they made me feel welcome and went out of their way to speak to me in English. Felix and his entertainment crew will keep you alive. These guys work day and night to keep the guest happy. From beach aerobics to pool games they work thier tales off for you. The pool winds through the resort so if you want quiet time you can find it.The food was fine and little bland for us but okay. The kids loved the breakfast in the morning. The buffet is overwhelming and you are sure to find something to satisfy you. Get bottled water whenever you can. Your room fridge is usually stocked and a tip to the housekeeper will get you extra bottles (or towels etc) if you need.Last but not least the bars. Smile, tip (a dollar) and your drink will be fine trust me. $1 will go along way and I always left a $5 before I retired for the night. Talk to them, smile and the bartenders will be your best freind in no time. Make sure you say hello to Lidio at the lower level lobby bar. Ask him about Ramona... it will bring smile to his face and extra liquor in your cocktail of choice.To end. This is a extremely well designed, laid out and appointed resort. The staff will treat you as well as you treat them. In speaking to some these people work 15 hours a day for 24 days straight with six consecutive days off. With this they still smile and provide a proffessional level of service that is hard to find here in the U.S.  This place is truly MajesticThe service was excellent. The place is exquisite.

<Content>Majestic Colonial is Awesome!!! We have just returned from a week at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The hotel is fantastic, the property is beautiful and the service was unbeatable. We travel on average twice yearly and stay only in 4 or 5 star resorts, and Majestic Colonial didn't let us down. I'd done some research prior to coming, and the reviews didn't do the property or service justice. We have a 10 year-old daughter and she had a ball too! We highly recommend the Kids Club, Magalie was phenominal. We don't typically use the kids camps, but our daughter loved the camp and Magalie took care of the kids as if they were her own. She's a definite asset to the staff. Our daughter played during the day and danced nightly at the young adult (8-12 yr olds) club. What a great program.The food and spa were also excellent. We ate at 5 of the 8 restaurants and got messages on the beach. We couldn't have asked for a better vacation. The weather was perfect, always a breeze; our room was spacious and we had no problems. The refrigerator was well stocked and the staff were both friendly and prompt.We will definitely return. Now for a response to the typical questions Yes the staff is multi-lingual so if you don't speak Spanish it's okay, they translate, the main languages we heard were Spanish, French, Italian and German. And no we aren't fluent in Spanish, but understand it better than we speak it. We never left the resort, so we can't comment on any of the tourist attractions, but there is a night and day difference between the property and the route between the airport and the resort. Tips go a long way; we brought a bunch of $ 5.00 bills to tip and although most people didn't tip; our service was OUTSTANDING!!! So if nothing else, tip!!! The pool really is 4200+ feet long and what a great workout swimming the entire length daily. Snacks are ridiculously priced at the hotel gift shop so bring extras.The hotel has their own drink called the Majestic that is AWESOME too and they make it without liquor, but it's good with Rum too! If you're thinking about where to stay, I've already recommended the resort to several of my friends and will be returning again soon.

<Content>Welcom to paradis Nous rentrons d'un s茅jour superbe de 3 semaines au majestic colonial. Le service, la qualit茅 et l'abondance des buffets 茅taient superbes surtout les soir茅es de gala qui sont en plus un r茅gal pour les yeux.Les chambres sont impeccables et tr猫s belles jaccuzi dedans dehors...(merci 脿 jacinta notre femme de chambre pour ces magnifiques d茅co ) nous avions une suite majestic proche de la plage avec acc猫s priv茅 脿 la piscine le r锚ve avec des enfants.Le Kids club pour les moins de 10 ans est un site de jeu sympa m锚me si le programme des activit茅s n'a jamais 茅t茅 respect茅. Mais les soir茅e sont mieux organis茅es, entre les chansons au th茅atre suivi de la discoth猫que, ce qui permet aux petits de s'amuser pendant que nous allions au casino (Merci 脿 Jenny et magali).Apr猫s 3 s茅jours 脿 punta cana je risque de changer de destination l'an prochain mais d猫s que je peux j'y retournerai.Petit conseil aux fran莽ais m锚me si c'est all inclusive, un petit tips de temps en temps quand vous 锚tes satisfait, et ils se mettent en quatre pour vous 锚tre agr茅able.

<Content>Mixed Rating This property is quite tough to give an outstanding or poor rating for various reasons. The buildings, the pools, the spa, the beach are outstanding.The food and restaurants are average. The staff tried very hard to do a good but when you mentioned that you didn't like something or you thought it should be different they were prompt to say  if you complain they might change it.The rooms are very well designed and the decor is very nice but if you like to sleep/relax in a comfortable bed.. the beds are like sleeping on a rock!They have all the ingredients to make this a must visit property, but if they don't get help soon, this will property will become another average all inclusive property in the caribbean. They will continue to attract people with beautiful photos and competitive rates but after your first visit you probably won't be back.

<Content>An American who will definitely go back!! Can't believe we were at the same property that some reviewers give such bad ratings. Have traveled all over the world and the Majestic is definitely one place we will go back to again. My wife and I spend 7 nights there in April and not only had a great time but didn't find any of the problems that some spoiled people seem to have had. You are in a foreign country, so why do you expect everyone to speak English?We enjoyed the room, the beach, the pool, the food - we did try all the restaurants (made reservations right when we arrived) and also the buffets. We did NOT have to take any pills, always had good food and sufficient choices. They even made a special birthday cake for my wife and all sang Happy Birthday to her.And most of all we enjoyed the smiles and the friendliness of ALL the people that work at the Majestic. If they didn't speak English, they tried or brought some one else who could communicate with us, which is a lot more than they will do in Europe, especially in France or Eastern Europe. They always went out of there way to take care of us, always smiled, and where the friendliest people, who we have come across other than the fiendly Hawaiians. They were a lot more helpful and took better care of us than most of the hotel or restaurant employees in the States, and especially the ones in Europe.And as to not fitting in, we met many nationalities, and since we have traveled the world we made aquaintances with many of them. From Spain, from Germany, from Poland, from the UK, from Canada, from Brazil, from Norway, from Sweden, and many Americans from all over the US - we had no problem meeting many of them and making friends with quite a few. I guess you get out what you put into an experience. The employees were especially appreciative when we tried to learn some words from them, and showed some interest in them while they in turn were learning English from us. There was no more of a Spanish problem here than there is every day in the States especially in our area in Texas - at least these people are trying to learn English and are required to take classes every day.Don't let the negative reviews scare you off, if you go with an open mind and want to have a good time, with nice people, good food, a great pool and great beach, and people that try hard to take care of you and entertain you, you will have a good time. We definitely will be back again.

<Content>Great time!! Stayed at the Majestic Colonial from July 23-30 and absolutely enjoyed it!It was our honeymoon and we were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a balcony and outdoor jacuzzi. The view was beautiful.The hotel was beautiful and well kept. There was constant upkeep of the place which is good to see!The workers were extremely friendly, happy and helpful. The Animation team were awesome...all of them (Jose, Gregory, Catherine, and all the others who I didn't get their names...sorry guys). The food was good. I wouldn't recommend brushing your teeth with the tap water though. My husband and I got a bit sick, but were fine.The beach is beautiful! The weather was awesome....it rained at night and was beautiful during the day. On the last couple of days of our stay the water was a bit rough...so make sure you book your water excursions earlier just in case of a cancellation because of the possibility of rough water. As a tip, I would recommend taking a lot of $1american bills for tips (yes, they do expect tips-it's their main source of income). If you find that you run out, ask the bellboys. We should have tipped the maids every now and then....I meant to do it at the end, but I don't think they realized that. It was an awesome experience and I would go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>A relly nice vacation We just got back yesterday from a week vacation (07.27.06-08.03.06) at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana Resort. The experience was great!! We really enjoyed our stay and wished we could stay a little longer. The animation crew is awesome and made our stay a blast- Ricky, Shaka Zulu and the rest of the guys - two thumbs up!!I did not find a barrier on the language since most of the staff either speak English; Italian; French; Spanish: Portuguese. Thank God we speak both English and Spanish!There is a kids area but our daughter which is 9 years stayed with us at all times. Also the spa is delightful, we each had two different sessions including a pedicure and was soo gooood! The room was beautifully decorated and VERY CLEAN. We stayed on a junior suite with direct access to the pool besides it had a whirlpool on the balcony no complaints except with the a/c unit. The maids service A++. We tipped the maids/bar/restaurant to share a little of what we have. It is as in everywhere if you treat people nice they will do whatever it takes to keep you happy!The food variety was okay, but certainly there is room for improvement as well as with the drinks.We made new friends with different people around the world, Russia; Spain; USA; Nicaragua; Cuba. I highly recommend it! ;)

<Content>Love the pool!!!! I stayed at the Majestic Colonial for 6 days, 5 nights, and was very happy with my stay. I LOVE the pool! It is beautiful! The entertainment at the pool was also great, but if you didnt want to be a part of it, the pool is large enough to distance yourself from it. I went to the gym which has enough equipment to get a full body workout in. There are free weights, tredmills, elipticals, a stair master, and bikes. There is also other various machines and benches. The guy in the gym, Cesar, was very helpful with the equipment and converting the kilograms to pounds. He also keeps some upbeat music playing, which is nice. And towels are provided in the gymk as well. It was very nice to have so many bi-lingual (and multi-lingual) workers.Make sure you go to the theatre in the evening. The shows are excellent!The only things I was not impressed with was the alcohol and food. I drank non-alcoholic beverages because the alcohol was not very good. If you like sweet, stick to the Majestic and Coco Loco. The food was not the best. All the seafood tasted the same, a lot of fried food, and meat in so many dishes, including seafood dishes. I recommend the French and Japanese restaurants, which are the only 2 you need a reservation for.

<Content>Enjoyable Week This was our 5th summer in a row that we visited the Caribbean. The Majestic is a very nice resort for an all-inclusive property.  The Beach - We have been to Boca Chica, Montego Bay, San Juan and Punta Cana is head and shoulders better than the others. The Resort - The Ritz Carlton in San Juan and in Montego Bay are nicer. The Majestic is nicer than The Coral Hilton in Boca Chica and Breezes in Punta Cana, which is a dump! The lobby is absolutely beautiful! It reminds me of a Ritz. The rooms are nice and spacious. The beds are hard and the pillows flat. The Food - The food was good by Dominican standards. Entertainment- The Majestic has something for everyone. My wife and I relaxed on the beach every day for 7-8 hours. Our 4 sons, ages 16-21, participated in a lot of the games offered by the staff. At night they have a show at 10:00 that was great to some and OK to others( I'm with the others). The same casino was OK but the staff was very unfriendly! The trumpet player was excellent, very romantic. The Staff- Dominicans at the Majestic,for the most part, want to please their customers. They are very hard workers and always have a smile on their face(except the casino employees).The language barrier still exists but has greatly improved since 2003. There seems to be more Americans traveling to the Dominican and it seems as though the Dominicans realize this and are making a better effort to accomidate us. Overall, my family enjoyed their stay. However, my cousin and his family didn't care for their trip. They enjoy The Atlantis Resort more while we enjoy relaxing, eating, and diving.

<Content>A Must read for Americans writen by one. My fianc茅e and I stayed at the Majestic for seven nights from July 23 thru July 30 2006.Our overall impression of the trip was very positive and we both recommend the Majestic and the Dominican Republic.The Dominican Republic:My first impression of the country while driving from the airport to the resort left me a bit worried for my safety. The country does have some impoverished areas and looks a bit scary. However these initial impressions were false and by the end of the trip I was completely comfortable outside the resort.The country itself is worth experiencing - I recommend while in country you book an excursion to get out and see the landscape and its people. We went on an excursion to LaRomona which I strongly recommend. Book the tour thru the Cheap Caribbean representative named Tomas Cruz; he is great and speaks good English. The Majestic:The resort was beautiful and the grounds were immaculate. Bravo to the grounds keepers! The hotel staff was friendly and did their best to speak English. The service was so good from the bartenders, waiters,  housekeepers that I felt compelled to tip them for their efforts. The room we stayed in was the Jr suite, the smallest and least expensive. The room was spacious, clean,  luxurious. Hotel staff cleaned the room and restocked the frig with beer, water,  soft drinks daily.The pool is huge with ample space to swim without bumping into other people. Plenty of lounge chairs are present so there鈥檚 no problem finding one.The beach is gorgeous with plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas. The ocean provides a mix of reef area for snorkeling and soft ocean floor. Alcoholic drinks at the majestic are local alcohol 鈥?they鈥檙e okay - serviceable to get drunk on but not high quality. They do offer the option to pay for top shelf liquor and beer for $5. The entertainment was, for lack of a better word, entertaining. Every night there was a saxophone player who鈥檚 very talented and he set a romantic mood. The shows at night are good and worth watching. The Food:Breakfast is served in the buffet and offers every type of traditional breakfast food I could think of eating. I especially enjoyed the fresh fruit, fresh squeezed juices and made to order omelets. Lunch at the Majestic is adequate. The buffet lunch has many choices but the food quality and taste are average. The Resort does offer lunch at the beach restaurant featuring hamburgers and hotdogs - however the taste is slightly different than what Americans will be accustom. Dinner is exceptional! I recommend you eat every dinner at the restaurants and stay away from the buffet. - The Japanese steak house is on par with Benihana鈥檚, - The Chinese restaurant is comparable to PF Changs. The restaurant has a sushi bar which my fianc茅e said was the best sushi she ever ate.- The Mexican restaurant is good. - The steakhouse on the Beach offers a decent steak with a great view.Overall:After speaking with tourists staying at other resorts, I would recommend the Majestic over the other all inclusive. The Majestic seemed to have the best food  entertainment. The Dominican Republic is a great country to visit.

<Content>Like Hotel I like the experience in Majestic. I have been there with my wife 7 nights and they where the first holidays. I didn鈥檛 know what to expect. My wife was sic because the food we eat but nobody helps us and everybody told me to go to the doctor and I went. It was very expensive to go there. They have a very good professional in the hotel, they are Alexandra and Ricky. In general the hotel works well. The (maleteros) are very rood when you don鈥檛 give money.

<Content>Pretty good for the price My husband and I stayed at the Majestic for 7 days at the end of June. We were very happy with our stay. The resort is kept clean and well manicured. Our room was beautiful! (The bathroom was weird, but we adjusted) The other reviews are correct, the beds are hard as a rock and the pillows are sad. After a few requests, we they brought us enough pillows (8) and we made due. But that was our only complaint. When we first got to our room, our TV wasn't hooked up and I thought OH NO, here we go, but the service man was there within 10 min. and fixed us right up. Our room was beautiful and there was no mold smell whatsoever.The food was ok. There was plenty to eat and I never left a restaurant hungry. Was it the best food on earth, no, but it was fine. The breakfast buffet was the best by far! The steakhouse was very good and the French restaurant was very good (SMALL portions there!). By the end of our week, we decided to try ordering extra menu items, and seeing if it would work. The staff brought us what we ordered with no complaints. We didn鈥檛 go there expecting gourmet food, especially not for the steal of a price we got, and it wasn鈥檛 gourmet. But things were fresh and well presented and there was a good variety. Neither my husband nor myself had any stomach problems at all.The language barrier is a problem, but not unmanageable. The staff was ok, not overly friendly, but can鈥檛 say I blame them. The BEST part however was the spa. We had the best massages of our lives! Absolutely fabulous! The pool and the beach were both beautiful. There were always, at all time of the day, plenty of lounge chairs and 鈥榰mbrellas鈥? The pool and the beach water were both soooooo warm! It was great!Overall, we had a great time and would go back to the Majestic anytime we wanted a good, and cheap vacation.

<Content>beautuful resort...but i do not recommend it unless you speek spanish! My wife and i booked our trip to Majestic in April, and were there from july 21st thru 27th. after 3 months of anxious waiting, it was a very big let down! I wil note that the resort itself is beautiful. The pool is awesome, the beach is perfect! The room was clean and large with a great view (We had an ocean front/view).Now for the negatives:1. I will start with the language issues first, because in my opinion, this is what really made our vacation as bad as it was.Not only do 95% of the staff speak Spanish ONLY, but 95% of the guests as well. As stated in a review before mine, it is very hard to meat people, drink at the bar with people, and get involved in the pool games and activities when you are truly the only Americans and English speaking out of the group. To give a perfect example, they had bingo at the pool, and the letters and numbers were called in spanish only! now, im not a big fan of bingo, but this is just an example. When the staff does try to translate, which isnt very often because they must not feel the need being that all the guests speek spanish, you cant understand them anyway! My wife and I like to meet people, and spend time socially with other people, and we found it almost impossible. For this reason, we chose not to do any of the excursions! And for this reason, we will not go back to Punta Cana. Last year, we went to Cancun and had the time of our life. I highly recommend Cancun...the RIU CARIBE was awesome...to anyone!2. The food. I expected a lot more from a 5 star resort. Yes, they had lots of choices, but the taste of the food was not very good! The meats were very rough, seafood not very good. I dont know if I was spoiled ffrom the RIU in cancun last year, but this did not match up. I STILL have an upset stomach!3. The air conditioning in the room did not get cold enough. I like to come in from the beach or pool, where it is very hot, to a nice cold room. The air conditioners here max out at a certain temperature (19 degrees celcious) and that is it! i had trouble sleeping most nights because the room temperature was very unconfortable. After the first night, i tried explaining the problem to the staff, and nothing got fixed. I realy dont think it was a problem with the air conditioning unit...i just think that they set it so that the room will not get any cooler than the 19 degrees celcious. It may be fine for others, but not me. And my wife is always cold at home, and she agreed that it was way to warm.4. Night club played Spanish music only!I wasnt going to write a review, because i am not a negative person. But when you spend 2 or 3 thousand dollars on a vacation that you only get once a year, you expect more! And when you dont get it, theres really nothing you can do except wait untill next year! It was a big let down! I hope this review helps. If you are Spanish Speaking, you will have a much better time here! Again, it is a bautiful resort, we just couldnt get passed the launguage difference. Next year, back to the RIU in Cancun!

<Content>Majestic Delivers the goods We spent a week in Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana in mid-July (got back on July 27th) and had a nice, fun, relaxing time. The staff were universally helpful and friendly, the food was decent, our room was clean and spacious, and the beach was beautiful.In sum, if you are looking for a nice resort with a beautiful beach, you could certainly do worse than Majestic. Just remember that this is a highly developed tourist area and will not provide you with a nature experience (be prepared to deal with seeing plenty of tour helicopters buzzing overhead, parasails, banana boats, motor boats, etc). We hope that you find this review helpful! Punta Cana: Majestic is one of at least a dozen all inclusive resorts lining the beach, and all follow a similar arrangement. If you walk on the beach west for about twenty minutes, you will pass all the neighboring resorts and it will be more peaceful, quiet and natural there, but no resort staff clean the beach at that point so some trash will wash up there. Walking on the beach in the opposite direction will take you past resort after resort for miles, some of them appearing very crowded. Some times salesmen from other resorts will try to lure you into theirs. We took a sneak peek in some of the other resorts, and they each have different features. We thought Majestic looked the nicest, basically because of its huge, meandering pool. Grounds/Facilities: Apparently the place is only about a year old. The shrubbery is newly planted, and very small, and the artificial fountains on the resort grounds are not all up and running, and the entrance to the resort is still a construction zone. All rooms have nice balconies, or if on the ground floor, outdoor jacusis. If you can, request a room with a pool or ocean view, as the garden views are kind of crappy. The pool: Sort of the centerpiece of the resort grounds, it stretches for about 400 meters, but is only 4 feet deep, so no deep end or diving. The pool is warm, not brisk. It has nice jacuzzi areas and is very pretty at night.The beach itself: much less crowded than neighboring resorts, and we never had a problem getting beach chairs under nice umbrellas. The water itself is divided into small, roped off areas -- one for swimming , one for the boat launch. water is warm and full of fish even in shallow areas. Lovely beach for lounging, dozing, taking in the beautiful view, people watching (see #9).Water Sports: The resort offers use of snorkel gear, kayaks, katamarans and windsurfing at no extra cost, but requires a 50 dollar lesson to use the katarmanans if you have never done so. They also offer fishing, scuba etc at cost.Snorkeling: A 2 hour snorkeling trip (actially about only 50 minutes in the water) is about 30 bucks. They take you out by motor boat out to sea where the water is deeper and the coral formations more elaborate. It is nice but not breathtaking. We heard Catalina island was better, but didn't go (read below). Some people brought bread with them and fed the fish, which led to huge numbers swarming around you. In our opinion the motor boat snorkeling trips should have been inclusive, not extra money.Excursions: There are several different kinds of all day or half day trips offered at extra cost. We wanted to go to Catalina island, but they only offered trips there with forced stops for shopping, corny entertainment, and so on, so we decided to just stay at the resort.Weather: it was hot and sunny pretty much the whole time, except for our last day, which was cloudy. It only rained twice the whole time, both very brief periods. A constant breeze came in off the ocean. There was a pretty strong current moving sideways in the water, and sometimes larger waves which kicked up sand and effected underwater visibility. Wildlife: some pelican type birds at the beach, hunting for fish. We also saw lizards and a large spider. And of course, the fishes.Some notes and recommendations if you go:1) A couple of the restaurants require reservations. Book your restaurant reservations on your first or second day as they fill up.2) Do not rely on the front desk for a wake up call -- we asked for one for 6.45 AM and got a call at 5.50, and oddly another one at 6.00.3) Most staff don't speak English.4) They had several places to eat, our favorite was La Hispaniola near the beach, which had seafood and steak menus.5) They only let you have one beach towel per person the entire time -- a little stingy. Perhaps you can tip the towel guy and get an extra.6) Bring all the sunscreen you will need with you, as they charge rip-off prices for that stuff at the resort.7) The enterainment is fun but cheesy, and a loud, roudy element congregates around the pool bar.8) Most of the resort patrons are Europeans or other Spanish speaking people, which is nice if you want to get away from other Americans. Consequently, the beach sports lots of topless ladies and men in speedos, so be ready !9) Be prepared to wear a plastic band around your wrist all week. This is to distinguish you as a patron of Majestic rather than one of the other neigboring resorts, and make sure you are not a freeloader.9) Go to the beach at night and look at the stars. Have fun!

<Content>OK not great The location is very pretty.Majestic Colonial Punta Cana Rooms are horribly designed. No privacy. Jr. suite is not accurate. It was an open no partition regular hotel room. The bathroom was a little closet and you could hear every bodily noise throughout the room. We paid top dollar for accommodation and were sorely disappointed. The food was poor at best. It was greasy with little taste. Reservations unobtainable at 2/5 restaurants for entire trip. Most staff were nice, the front desk were downright rude. Most did not speak English. Good thing we speak Spanish. Prices for anything not included were ridiculously high!!!Connections via American were nothing but a nightmare. It was a true Miracle that we made our connections on the return flight.The camp like atmosphere; always a salsa lesson and microphoned loud music at the pool and beach were a pain.I was upset that the price of our trip actually went down by about $150.00 after promotion (special price) ended from CheapCaribbean.com.

<Content>Great Vacation My wife and I with our two sons aged 15 and 19 just returned form a week at the Majestic. Just for a frame of reference we have traveled extensively throughtout the Caribbean and stayed at many all inclusives.Check in was a breeze. Our room had a less than desirable view but a quick phone call and two Presidente's later and we were moved no problem. ROOM Very large and well appointed. A few small bugs but nothing to be concerned about as we have seen some of these in most places. The refrigerator is stocked with beer, water and soft drinks. Naturally we needed extra so I left a note with 2USD on the refigerator that said Yo Quiero cinco cerevzas y cinco botellas de aqua. Rough translation I need five beers and five waters. Like magic no problem. Unlike when you travel in Europe if you try your best Spanglish they will try theirs and communication takes place.FOOD Hey its an all inclusive! That said the food was good. It is not five star but you can have everthing from steak to lobster. Go with the proper mindset and you will not be disappointed. We never went hungry and many of the meals were very good. The gourmet and Japanese require long pants but the food was so good even my boys did not mind. We wore linen drawstrings and flip flops. If you want to change walk to the room and pop on the shorts.ENTERTAINMENT Lots to do! The crowd by the pool was always into to something it starts around 9am then they take a break at 1 and then start again at 4pm. I went to get a beer and my son was involved in an arm wrestling match TOO FUNNY!Early and late evening there is a saxophone player by the main lobby named Domingo! He is an EXCELLENT musician and a nice person to boot.. Please tell him Juancito (John) and Barbara (Beverly) say hello. Late night the club is hopping until the wee hours of the morning just ask my boys!PEOPLE This to us was one of the best features. We as Americans were the minority. English is not the predominant language. There were people form Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden etc... My boys LOVED meeting those people from other countries and learinng about how they live. Just as a note because of this international crowd there are a lot of topless women. This is normal for them and really is no big deal. After a day or so you really did not think much of it. My older son met a friend from Germany and we in turn met his parents. We spent a couple of enjoyable evenings with both couples struggling to communicate over drinks.. My guess is that our sons will go to visit one another in the near future.LESSONS LEARNEDTips (a few dollars here and there go a long way)Noise it can be noisy and people stay up a lot later than I did. If you are a light sleeper bring ear plugsDO not fret over the language barrier. Bring a phrase book, use your hands, draw, act like you are playing charades and it is a lot of fun.Stomach stuff can happen and a little happened to me... Drinks, sun, lobster, desert can harm even a cast iron stomach like mine. Bring some Immodoium and or Pepto Bismol and you will be fine.Drink LOTS of water the sun is hot and you need to stay hydrated.We brough our own insulated mugs (Bubba Kegs) so during the walk from the beach to the bar your drinks stay cold.This is a great hotel with a great staff and our whole family gave it very high reviews.PS find Louis in the Taino restaurant and share s shot of their local drink Mamajuana!

<Content>Great experience! Reviewer: A 43 year old mom from Colorado, USAI went to Punta Cana last year and stayed at one of the Barcelo' hotels. Overall experience: 3 stars. This year my daughter graduated from high school and chose Punta Cana as end of school trip. 6 of her friends came along and I went as a chaperone.I highly reccomend this resort. It is great for all ages. My daughter and her friends had a blast. I was concerned about the free drinking since it is illegal for them to drink here in the US, but the general atmosphere, the daily games by the pool, the entertainment in the evening kept them busy with other fun things to do. In the end they drank as much as any responsible adult would have done.All the staff, from the entertainment crew to the room maids, was awesome. They seemed to go out of their way to make us feel at home. Please bring a whole bunch of single dollars to tip them. It is always appreciated.My daughter and I used the Spa for a massage and were very pleased. The Spa pedicure was nothing special (if you need one, just get the regular package).The jazz duo, in the evening, by the Plaza, was a nice touch. The music was Kenny G type. Not my favorite, but definitely very relaxing to sit there with a drink before dinner.The entertainment and dances by the pool were a lot of fun. Everybody fell in love with the Taqui Taqui dance. Our group filmed the moves and almost everyone has the song now on their MySpace profile. Thanks to Jose, Sandy, Felix and the rest for all your efforts and great work! The shows were fun to watch. The male dancers were incredibly good! We specially liked the Michael Jackson show. One reviewer wrote that the shows were not kid appropriate. There was indeed a 9 1/2 weeks dance that at the end was a bit too explicit. The rest, I would say, is rated G.We enjoyed the two buffet restaurants during the day (the food is not excellent but good enough if you are spending the day by the pool or the beach). In the evening we went to the other restaurants. Our favorite was the Japanese. Our least favorite, the Gourmet.The club definetely needs improving. We took taxis (a reasonal fare would be 10/15 dollars) to other resort clubs. The Riu one is good. Areito too. Unfortunately I don't remember the names of the others. The waiters or the show staff would gladly suggest places to go dancing. Bring from home the things you may even remotely think you would need. The shops are outrageously expensive. I heard someone had paid $25 for a small bottle of Tylenol. I had this idea: if you need something (reasonable of course) ask the people hanging out by the pool. Chances are that you will get it for free. I would have definitely given some Tylenol to that poor guy. Our family and my daughter's friends can't wait to go back to Punta Cana and the Colonial Majestic. Thanks for the unforgettable experience!

<Content>Simply the Best! - From Baltimore, MD Where to begin...My husband and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial for 5 days and had the time of our lives. This resort is top notch. I cannot fathom anyone who did not have the same experience as us. The resort itself is absolutely breathtaking. The staff is so on point too. Not a minute goes by that these people are not working. They are incredibly efficient and will do just about anything to better accomodate you during your stay. There is a great cultural presence which is something my husband and I enjoy greatly. From the music, to the dance, to the language etc... you really feel submerged in this vibrant culture. Everyone is so friendly and it seems as though they smile all day long and are very polite. The Food: Not bad at all. Is everything tasty??? Of course not, but come on people. What makes it so nice is the variety. If you are not a fan of something chances are there will be something else that you can find more than edible. You will not go hungry at this resort that's for sure. They had a GALA one night in the main dining area which was fantastic. I was skeptical of the sushi (as to be expected), but was surprisingly satisfied. It wasn't bad at all. As for the lunches, that was the only time I wasn't overly zealous about the food. I'm not a fried food, red meat lover and it seemed to be a bit on the unhealthy side for my tastebuds. But again, there is always something you can find. I stuck with the salad bar and was content. The Rooms: They are large with a modern decor. They are kept spotlessly clean. The refridgerator is restocked daily so no need to worry. I have no complaints. I loved my room. Jacuzzi tub inside and outside the room....loved it!!The Entertainment Staff: You've got to love 'em. They were energetic and humorous. There transition from Spanish to English was comical and I commend them for their efforts. Ricky (Ahhhh) is the best. You've got to go to understand. Felix El Gato is great too. The Michael Jackson show is beyond words. I'm so happy I got to see that performance. The Beach: WOW. Why go to the pool (although it is incredible how they designed it) when you've got beach right there at your feet. You've got to see it to believe it. All in all, I'd return to this resort without hesitation. For those of you considering it...I say go for it. Don't worry about the language thing...lots of Germans, French, Canadians, and some Italians were there during our stay and they seemed to be getting along just fine. I'm sure they didn't all speak Spanish.

<Content>New Mayan Riviera Let me start off with the beaches and water are absolutely gorgeous.The resort is okay. Rooms look okay but.... Air conditioner broke two times in a week stay, $5 coffee pot in room was missing basket and took two days for a replacement basket that had to be hand held to make it work. Food was comparable to a Luby's at best. One exception was the Japanese.I do have to say that when you spend $3000 to $4000 for a trip for two you expect a 4 to 5 star resort and service. This could be rated at a 3, max. English is a minority for guests and the staff, not that this is an issue (makes it more interesting and you get to meet different cultures) just noteworthy. I would also say that its a 50/50 of the impression that the people want you there and the other half dont. I stayed at the Secrets chain in Mexico last year and as someone else stated Maybe I peaked too soon . I would recommend to stay at another resort.

<Content>Great but not for us! First let me say that I traveled to Punta Cana for the main reason of relaxation. I speak very little Spanish and my wife only speaks english. This review will hopefully help others understand a little about the Majestic as well as the Dominican Republic! Hotel: Like others have stated, it is GORGEOUS! We had a room on the west side with a horrible view but spoke to the front desk and were moved to a room near the wet bar at the pool with a view of the ocean. Tremendous! The room, along with everything else there is gorgeous but did have some minor flaws in construction but I could of cared less.. Things to consider with the rooms that we did not care for: My wife is a BIG bath person and it takes about 45 minutes to fill up the tub with the low water pressure. Rooms have somewhat of a mildew smell but not a huge deal. Last is the noise and the maid service. We had some people above us that would move furniture around constantly and were so loud and the maid service usually knocked on our door each day around 8. They started earlier and you can hear them yelling to one another as early as 7 am! Not fun when you want to sleep in a little. (Note to guys: I loved the fact that they had telelvision with cable in English! After a long day at the beach it was nice to come in and relax to watch the British Open!)Food: We did not get sick our entire stay however like others we took pills each day to help prevent this. Food was very, very average. The restauraunts have some good food but the buffets and such are very different. It was not all bad however just bland and the spices and food they use there obviously have a different taste to them. We ate pasta most of the time and that was usually pretty good.Beach/Pool: GORGEOUS! Nice white sand and very clean! We never had a hard time getting a few chairs anytime of the day. It was easier at night as well. My wife and I found it VERY relaxing to walk the beach at night! We would sit and enjoy the sounds of the ocean as we looked into a star filled sky! VERY NICE!! Pool is awesome as well. I love the fact that it winds down around the entire facility. My wife and I never had a tough time getting chairs! Ver nice! Excursions: This is where you need to BEWARE! My wife and I took 2 off resort trips. One was the Bavaro Splash where you ride your own jet boats to a specific site and you snorkle for about an hour and then you return. This was pretty neat! Riding the boat is a blast and the snorkle area is outstanding. You feed fish and see all kinds of aquatic life! It is a half day trip. The next trip we took was the Sedona Island Trip. This was aboslutely horrible. Let me first warn you that it is a full day trip and by this I mean we left at 6:00am and returned at 9:00 pm. We left our hotel and drove 1 hour in a van. We arrived at a location with about 30 others and loaded up on a bus where we then drove another 2 1/2 hours to a village where we went to the bathroom. We then drove another 45 minutes to the beach where we got on a speed boat to ride another hour. We spent 1 hour in a cove that was suppose to have star fish but was not better than our beach at the Majestic and then spent another 2 hours at a very average beach. We then rode a catamaran boat back which took 2 hours and then proceeded to take the 4 hour venture back on the bus. It was a TERRIBLE waste of a day. A 13 hour day and 8 of those hours are on a bus! LONG DAY!Service: This depends. Some days it was great and some days it seemed as though the service did not really want to be there. From what I am to understand they work 21+ days and then get 3 days off so I am sure they get rather tired of what they do. I do not think they liked the fact that we did not speak Spanish. They do work HARD!! They are ALWAYS working on the grounds, cleaning, serving etc..Summary: I enjoyed relaxing at the beach and getting away from the world. My wife and I met some terrific people from the USA and really enjoyed their company! However, if you have never been to the Dominican Republic here are a few things you need to consider before traveling: Punta Cana is primarily a TOURIST location. THere is nothing else there but resorts. This is great however consider the fact that this side of the island does not have any town life that you can visit to go shopping or walk around. You are pretty much isolated to your resort. Because of this the excursions you go on you will have to travel a pretty good distance before you arrive at you destination. 1 hour plus. Beware of the shops. Some of the workers get very hands on and pull you into their shacks! Last but not least consider that 95% of the employees do not speak English and even worse 95% of the tourists do not speak English as well. This made it very, very difficult for my wife and I to enjoy meeting new people and taking part in the activities around the resort. Everything was in spanish and we often felt like outsiders due to the fact that we could not communicate with others around us. It does not seem like a tourist location for Americans. Because of these aspects we would probobly not return however, The Majestic was gorgeous and the beaches were outstanding for relaxing.Feel free to email me with any questions!

<Content>A great vacation!!!! We just returned to the states yeterday from our week at the Majestic and here are some quick tips for making your vacation better in the Dominican Republic.... understand and remember that even though you are staying at a luxury resort, you are still in a third world country and these people are giving you everything that they have. They are a very happy people that are full of life and are constantly busting there humps to make your stay enjoyable.MARKET- WARNING ... DO NOT GO!!! We went off the property to the local market which was right out the main gates of the resort. They are all fighting for your business and will grab you and pull you into their shops and close the door behind you and stand there holding the door knob. As soon as you get out of the door the next person is pulling you physically into their store. STAY AWAY! There are some shops on the resort that will offer the same things and they will also bring some other vendors in from the market that will set up tables during your stay. You can barter with the vendors, just not the shops on the resort. Wait for them to come to you!FOOD- The food was good. We highly recommend the Japanese restaurant (make your reservation as soon as you arrive with guest services as this one books like 4 days out). The Seafood side of the playa Beach area was also wonderful and if you cannot decided from what is on the menu, ask for both and they will be more than happy to bring you two full meals. The Steakhouse was not so great. They offered a good cut of mean, just not prepared well. We did not eat at the Taino or Le Gourmet as the men had to wear pants to get into the LeGourmet. You cannot go wrong with the buffets.... many choices!A good tip is to take Pepto Caplets or Immodium with you and take them every morning like you would vitamins...our stomaches were not used to the unprocessed foods and dairy there. Although the food was good, we would have to make a return trip to the room directly after every meal until we started just taking Pepto before eating.ROOMS- Bring your own pillows. They have Pepsi products at the Resort and in the rooms. They did a nice job of keeping the wet bar filled for us and remembered what we liked from day to day and would make sure we had those things. We would leave $2-3 for the cleaning service and always received excellent results. Keep in mind they do not have washcloths in each room, but you can call the front lobby and get some. Bring some scented candles because the rooms smell a little musty like, but that is only because of the humidity in the air. It took my swimsuit 2 full days out on the balcony to dry and when I would get out of the shower, my hair would stay wet until the next morning. ENTERTAINMENT-The entertainment team was great. There was always something going on with them. You must see the Michael Jackson show, it is amazing. The other shows were good as well, but the MJ show brought the house down!All in all, we had a great time and would definately go back!

<Content>Excellent UNBELIEVEABLE!!!! Arrived May 20th...read many poor reviews...not TRUE. Traveled from Raleigh, NC, met best friend from NY at airport....customs not bad at all...trip from airport...is an adventure...then we were dropped off in Paradise...check in very easy, hospitality better than five star..Gregorio at front desk very friendly...Angel, bell boy very hospitable...room fantastic....rooms very big, air con great, clean, well stocked refig...awesome view.THE BEACH: Awesome, never a problem getting lounges...did not have to reserve early in AM...many to choose from...best spot near volleyball net...not much coral or rocks...white sand, sun, gorgeous water and games if you want to participate. Only problem with the beach is that the bar is a bit of a walk. This beach is enjoyed by all nationalities and many women are topless so take this in to consideration if you have childrenTHE POOL: TOO MUCH FUN! Entertainment Crew was THE BEST! THEY made our vacation UNFORGETTEABLE! Great Games, and VERY HARD WORKERS....Natty, Aurelia, Billy, Sandy, Johnny and Eddie went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our time at the Majestic to the fullest. They are talented, dedicated performers who do all they can to make sure the guests enjoy their time at the Majestic. They work long hours for many days and deserve to make much money!THE POOL BAR: Ishmael is the BEST....we became fast friends, never waited for a drink or a hug! He was always very personable and it was a very short time before he knew what we drank and when he saw us coming, he had our drinks ready for us. Very hard working. Always kept us laughing and having a good time.THE SWIM UP BAR: FUN, FUN, FUN....Alexander you are the BEST....he taught us some Spanish phrases, and even though he spoke little English, he knew exactly what we wanted, when wanted it. GREAT DANCER!NIGHTLIFE: We were lucky enough to see the Michael Jackson Show...it was FANTASTIC...be careful of vendors outside before shows...they want full price for their wares..but you can negotiate...Disco is open after shows...entertainment crew is there getting everyone to dance and have a good time!FOOD: I am a very picky eater (Vegetarian) and my friend is very particular also...the food was not great for us...not that there wasn't a variety or it wasn't well presented, but we pretty much existed on rice, potatoes and cooked vegetables while we were there.OVERALL: Great Trip,would recommed to anyone, would definitely go back...anyone that is looking at the cracked tiles, lack of landscaping or areas under construction etc., is not there to enjoy the beauty and magic of the Majestic.Can't wait to visit again. Hola, Ishamel, Alexander, Natty with my glasses, Aurelia, Johnny ( all-inclusive), Billy and Eddie...you all made our dreams come true...love you, Lexi and LindaP.S. Johnny, hope you are taking good care of the hat!

<Content>Good, but not Five Stars! My husband and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial from July 13th - July 19th. We had a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation. I would be remiss if I didn't write a review as I utilized trip advisor to learn more about Majestic Colonial. The property is beautiful and the hotel tries to live up to being a five star but falls short. There were subtle things that made it apparent, such as, no one cleaning up around the pool. By mid day the circumference of the pool was filled with used drink cups. No one helped with beach chairs. Cards were given to obtain towels for the beach, and when the towel was returned you got your card back. No card upon check out, it was $20 fee. I called to report the pillow cases were wet that were put on the bed, assured that someone would make the change but no one ever came to the room. It was those sorts of things that took away from a true five star hotel. We tipped often throughout the day and found the $1 tip made a world of difference in the service delivered. Felix the bartender at the beach was very appreciative and had drinks ready as we approached the bar . The housekeeping staffed replaced whatever was necessary in the wet bar, when left a note and $1. This is a very poor area and $1 is a lot of money to them. Go with singles because change is not easy to come by.The food was okay, but by no means gourmet. The breakfast buffet was excellent, offering almost anything you can imagine for breakfast with the exception of waffles, but they aren't missed.Other then the buffet between 8:30 - 10AM, there is a continental breakfast offered. Lunch was a buffet at the beach. It had a lot of choices as well as the American fair of hamburgers, hot dogs, and cold cuts. There was another buffet for lunch at Portofino where breakfast is served. That buffet was a bit more extensive but if at the beach it was out of the way to go for lunch. Dinner had several choices, the Gourmet restaurant (reservations needed, and can only go once in a stay or once a week) and the Japanese Masuri is the same as the gourmet. Both are good but not excellent and not over the top. The Japanese cook is Dominican and has only been there for five months, he has no formal training. I found this out at our dinner, which is served at a hibachi table with other people. The gourmet restaurant we went to twice as we went on Friday and were allowed to go again early the next week. The first time is was quite good but the second time was not up to par. Tiano is the Mexican/Dominican restaurant which had a small buffet of Dominican cuisine plus the dish you ordered off the menu. The food is fine, there is something for everyone. There is always the buffet for dinner which seemed to be frequented by families as there is a lot for children on the buffet. The shows were entertaining, somewhat hokey at times but the staff tries very hard to present an hour of entertainment. The Michael Jackson show is excellent and shouldn't be missed. The other show which we enjoyed was the Latin show. All shows are 10PM and last for one hour.Our room was lovely with a garden view. It did have a musty odor.Knowing this ahead of time I came prepared with incense and Airwick Solid Airfresheners, but when unpacking my suitcase, all my clothes needed to be laundered. The musty odor came back to the states with us. There is very little shopping there. The market which is outside the hotel gave my husband and me an uncomfortable feeling. It was unlike a busy market place you might find in Cancun as hardly anyone was there. We came back to the hotel and purchased small items to bring home. As far as sunscreen, toiletries, and drug items, think ahead, they are very costly . Bring Imodium as you never know. I was very careful yet on day four was stricken. My husband who ate everything and had ice in his drinks and was fine. I guess it happens. I brought all the necessary remedies with me and tried hard not to let it ruin the vacation. I brought bug repellent as suggested but didn't need it at all.In summary, the Majestic Colonial is a fine resort and tries hard to meet everyone's needs. I would recommend it without hesitation. Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions.

<Content>Very enjoyable stay at the Majestic My boyfriend and I stayed at the Majestic 07/10 through 07/15 and we had a very enjoyable and relaxing stay. We booked our trip through Cheap Caribbean which was great - everything was taken care of from being picked up at the airport and being taken back without any difficulties. We would definitely use their services again. Be aware that upon arriving at the airport in Punta Cana, you are required to buy a tourist card for $10 which they issue you and then collect shortly thereafter. HOTEL: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful....and it is MAJESTIC! The grounds are beautiful, were constantly being attended to and it is exceptionally clean. The grounds are quite large but not too large that you can't comfortably walk everywhere you need to go. ROOMS: We have been to many resorts on many islands and this room was by far the nicest room we have ever stayed in. We were in room 4319 and didn't have a view but that was unimportant to us. *The only downfall to the room was the lack of privacy for the toilet facilities. It is basically a stall with a door that is open at the top and the bottom. While I certainly wasn't a fan of that, I would think that would be a very uncomfortable situation perhaps for couples who hadn't been together very long or groups or families sharing the same room. Mini-fridge was kept stocked daily. No washcloths but great towels! Awesome shower and jacuzzi tubBeds are very hard and the pillows are very flat - I took my own pillow! We were never awakened early by the maids/staff knocking on our door but I would imagine this depends upon your room location.....we were situated in the middle of the hotel and they probably start at one end and work their way through until they're done. STAFF: Very, very friendly and hard-working. The entertainment staff was exceptional. I was amazed at how they were at the pool most of the day and full of energy and then back for the evening and still going strong! Another reviewer had written an opinion that they were rude and only spoke to those they were interested in getting with and I couldn't disagree more. As a couple, we were approached and greeted by the staff just being friendly. We felt everyone at the resort was very friendly and accomodating. They were also very appreciative of any tips and we tried to do that often. POOLS: Gorgeous - perfect temperature - clean - plenty of chairs and shade available. If you want activity, hang out near the staff where they have games, music etc. If not, just go to a more private area and you can relax peacefully. BEACH: Beautiful water and calm enough to swim in. Plenty of chairs available as well as umbrellas. Just like the pool, you can relax or get involved with the staff playing games etc. - your choice. FOOD: I'm a very picky eater but I didn't go hungry. What I did eat was very good but I didn't get too adventurous! The Japanese restaurant as noted here by everyone else is a must and is excellent. We also did the Gourmet restaurant and I thought it was very good as well. The rest of the meals we ate at the buffet and one night ate at the steakhouse. Honestly, we almost cancelled our trip before we even left after reading so many reviewers commenting on how sick they got! We were really paranoid about eating anything! Like another reviewer, we went stocked up with Imodium and Pepto-Bismol and thankfully, never needed any of it. If you do get sick, you probably won't be very appreciative of the lack of privacy your in-room bathroom provides! LANGUAGE: It was hard to understand many of the staff and likewise, many of them didn't understand much English but we managed okay. We got the feeling that as Americans, we were very much in the minority there as it seemed to be more of a vacation destination for Spanish-speaking tourists (Spain, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Columbia) but it certainly was not a problem at all. It was a beautiful resort and if we return to the Dominican Republic, we most likely would stay there again, however, we like to travel to different places so probably would explore somewhere else for our next trip.

<Content>Simply Majestic My wife and I returned a week ago from the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana (July01-July07). We had an unbelievable time and enjoyed every minute that we were there. Everything that we could have wished for in a resort was met and exceeded.PUNTA CANA AIRPORT: The airport is beautiful and is what one would expect in a tropical paradise. They were very caring and courteous when it came to the issue of our lost luggage. They insured us that the bag would reach us by the end of the day鈥?and it was delivered that night before dinner.CHECK-IN: Check-in was a little rough due to not having our travel vouchers (our fault; forgot them at home) for the hotel. This was a slight problem but after talking to CheapCaribbean.com, the problem was promptly corrected. The front desk manager, Gregorio Jimenez, was extremely helpful, and we were given wristbands to enjoy the resort even before we were properly checked-in.ROOM: The room was absolutely beautiful. I had written the reservation manager, Aurelio Sanchez, before we left for a second or third floor room with a view of the pool and beach; and we were given just that. We were in room 2332 and had a view of the pool, pool bar, pool activities and the ocean. Just what we wanted! Not that we were in our room all that much. The room d茅cor was a dark mahogany and had a four-post bed. Unreal! The room was cleaned thoroughly every day, as well as the mini-fridge being stocked with fresh beer, soda and water.FOOD: The food was amazing and better than what I expected. We ate at every restaurant and enjoyed them all. I did a little research before we left and ordered what others had recommended. I was never disappointed. Seafood Restaurant: lobster, Steakhouse: chateaubriand, Local Restaurant: steak fajitas, Gourmet Restaurant: filet mignon, Chinese: duck; we also ate at the Japanese Hibachi and buffet, and both were excellent as well. My wife generally ordered something different than me, and her food was also very good. We never got sick, but had slight digestive problems that were quickly fixed with Pepto or Immodium鈥攚hat we expected from the new and different types of food we were trying.ACTIVITIES: My wife and I did not participate in the activities, but we sure did enjoy watching. It looked as if the entertainment staff were active there from 0900 until 2400 with no break. They work extremely hard and do their job very well. I was very entertained watching everyone doing the 鈥淭AKI-TAKI鈥?dance.GROUNDS: The landscaping is immaculate and beautiful. It seems as if there are workers grooming the grounds twenty-four hours a day. Never did you find anything out-of-place. BEACH: The beach is perfect. There are plenty of huts to sit under, no matter what time of the day you get there. The sand is powdery white and is very soft on the feet. The beach goes on forever in either direction. I did plenty of snorkeling right out front of the resort, and saw plenty of fish. In fact, we went on a snorkeling excursion and found the fish to be equally impressive at both locations.POOL: The pool goes on forever!!! We brought floats to use and it was really nice to float from one end of the pool to the other while sipping on a tropical drink. Be sure to bring your own floats as the resort does not provide them. The pool was kept extremely clean, and I found it to be the most impressive pool鈥攐f any where I have been. The area of the pool under the spa roof was kept a little cooler and was refreshing to sit in there after being in the sun all day. Again, never a wait for a lounge chair or a hut.BARS: There seems to be bars allover the resort. I am not even sure that we made it to all of them. The service was generally pretty good. However, if you tip and make a friend at the bar, they would get you a new drink even before you finished the first one. Tipping, however, was not necessary, and service would still be good.SERVICE: Service was very impressive. It seemed as if there were two servers for every table in the ala carte. Never once did our waters or drinks go dry before we were served another one. We met a couple of waiters and it seemed no matter what restaurant we went to, they were there also. Enough can not be said about the service at this resort. Not everyone spoke English, but they generally knew enough to get you what you wanted. Just a little respect of their country and resort will go a long way鈥?so will a smile and a positive attitude.NIGHTLY ENTERTAINMENT: The shows were excellent. They were either extremely funny, or laden with talent. Either way, the shows were a pleasure to watch. Our favorite was the Michael Jackson show! It was so realistic. Try to make it to every show鈥?you will not be disappointed. DISCO: My wife found the disco to be fun, but I found that the only music they played was Latin-themed. I prefer more of the heavy beat, rap, techno for dancing so I all I did was drink there; which was ok. My wife actually found a couple of people to dance with, so that was good for her. Also, the volume is very loud so it is a little difficult to communicate within the premise.CASINO: I really didn鈥檛 get to play much, but a couple we met there had a little luck. Games included roulette, blackjack, three- and five-card poker, and slot machines. I wish I would have had a little more time to test my luck鈥?maybe next time. The casino is pretty small but it never seemed crowed as not many people play. Only time it is slightly crowded is right after the nightly show.CHECK-OUT: Check-out went very smoothly. We didn鈥檛 use the phone or accumulate any other charges. Make sure you have (both) your towel cards when checking-out. Otherwise, I believe, there is a $20 charge per towel. Again, front desk was very helpful.OVERALL: We had a wonderful time!!! That about sums it up. We don鈥檛 have much vacation time, but we are going to try and schedule another trip as soon as possible. The people and country are so beautiful. I hope you will give this resort a shot; I鈥檓 sure you will love it. If you have any questions, please feel free to E-mail me.

<Content>Romantic Vacation Resort Our stay at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana was a trip to remember. The service was excellant !!!The staff tried very hard to accomadate our every need. I spoke little Spanish...but still got the drinks I wanted. The alcohol that was included in the package was not the best, but for the price we paid you could not have asked for more.

<Content>Great stay at the Majestic Colonial! And we didn't get sick! My husband and I stayed at the Majestic Colonial July 14-18, 2006. I had read each and every review on trip advisor and was ready for anything. We had packed Imodium, pepto bismo, $100 single dollar bills, and all the other recommended items. We flew in on Spirits on Friday. The Dominican Airport is not at all like the airports I am used to seeing in the USA. It鈥檚 outdoors and very tropical looking. We had booked our trip through beach destinations---(who I recommend highly). They had the BEST prices online for the Majestic. Anyhow, we had booked a transfer from the airport to the Majestic and they were waiting for us when we arrived.We purchased the basic garden view room (the cheapest one). When we arrived to the Majestic, I asked for an upgrade to the pool view rooms in building 2. For a $7 tip our request was QUICKLY granted and we were given room 2319. The room is perfect because it鈥檚 right in the middle of the hotel and we were able to get to the beach, or buffet in equal time. Also, the pool is spectacular, so it鈥檚 a nice view to have. My husband and I speak Spanish, so we never had any problems with the language, but I heard many of the people working there trying to communicate with tourists with the little English they know. And as I said before, the American dollar goes VERY far. The hotel employees get paid very little and some work 13 hour days for 26 days straight!!! We tipped heavily and had fantastic service throughout our stay. The food was actually pretty good. After the reviews I read, I was impressed. We ate fantastic omelets every morning and had burgers and fries by the beach for lunch. The seafood in the beach restaurant was good and we loved loved loved MATSURI! By far the best food at the hotel! (Remember to take money for tips! The chef cooks for your group and it鈥檚 quite a show!) The only food I thought was terrible was at the Gourmet Restaurant. Don鈥檛 bother going there. After that dinner, we went straight to the buffet.We only made it to two shows. The first being ladies vs. men. The show was entertaining, especially the part when they wanted each team to collect items from the audience. I refused to give them my shoes. The second show was the Michael Jackson show, which was GREAT, (but a little odd, I wonder how they came up with the idea to have Michael Jackson in the Dominican Republic?) Unlike others, we didn鈥檛 participate in pool games and spent our days relaxing by the pool, and at the beach. It was a very very very very relaxing and romantic trip and we really enjoyed it!Oh, and of course my husband reminded me to add that we DID NOT get sick! We didn鈥檛 touch the pepto or Imodium during our vacation. I give this hotel 5 stars because it is definetly a good buy for the money. No, it isn't a 5 star resort by American standards, but for price, it's PERFECT! The Majestic has nice rooms, beautiful grounds and good service. I wouldn鈥檛 go back only because I like to travel and explore new places, but I do recommend this hotel!

<Content>OK but not the best! The hotel itself is absolutley beautiful. Staff do not speak very much English at all. Rooms are beautiful and very comfortable. Casino small but loved it! No didn't win but did provide good fun and the shows were pretty good! Especially the Michael Jackson show - a do not miss!Most important is ifyou like to use a wash cloth bring from home. They have none! Called to get one and they do not have any at all. Just large hand towels. TOO large for using as wash cloth. BUT towels are huge and plush and better than any other posh places I have stayed. The food was ok nothing to brag about. Didn't care for the daily lunch buffet by beach and Steak house basically terrible service and after we finished had to go to regular buffet since starving. I had just been to Mexixco in April and restuarants there were like real restaurants not a place to get salad from bar and dessert from dessert bar. They really need to pick up on the service end. Everyone there was very nice though! Pool fabulous as well as beach but if you want someplace wher they wait on you don't stay here! I never knew their were all inclusives with service on beach, at the pool and free room service. Room service here is available but very limited and you pay extra.Very safe enviroment but would not bring kids if they are picky eaters! We did decide the main large buffett area was the best bet for being able to find something everyone may like (other than children)Would consider coming again but would be better prepared. Bring snacks for room as not always something open when you are hungry! Too many other places to go and see so may not be back here again!

<Content>Amazing Vacation Service: The service was there was excellent. There were a few issues in our room such as a plugged drain and a falling towel rack, but those issues were quickly handled. The maids were excellent even though they would knock at the door early in the morning. The servers and bartenders were always quick to help you. Beach  Pool: The beach was absolutely beautiful. The water was warm and clear with clean sand. Beach chairs were not hard to find, neither was it hard to find a chair at the pool. The pool water was clean with beautiful landscaping done around it. Towels were not a problem to get.Restaurants: Food was excellent, especially in the Caribbean restaurant Taino. Japanese was okay, but nothing to rave about. All the food had the same ingredients in it. The chinese was good, along with the steakhouse and seafood. The buffet served the same foods everyday and dinner pretty much served the same food as lunch.Showtime: The shows were entertaining, especially Michael Jackson (Must See)!!!Entertainment Staff: They were very energetic and worked long hours 10 AM-12:30 AM. All were very friendly and funny (Ricky, Jose, Vladi, Gregory, Ana, Sandy, Felix). They made the activities exciting to do and did a great job with that. Disco: Played a lot of spanish music, but then again you are in a spanish speaking country and all the music was very dancable. The entertainment staff made it enjoyable teaching people how to dance to the different music that was played.

<Content>Pluses and minuses Just got back from a weeklong honeymoon at the Majestic. First of all, it was beautiful, clean, and very relaxing. Possibly the nicest pool I have ever seen, although less than 4 ft deep throughout.The service was phenominal. Very very nice people, who tried their hardest to be accomodating despite an occassional language barrier.On the negative side, there is not a lot to do there. The entertainment is pretty poor, the casino doesn't open until 8 PM, and the gym facilities are not up to health-club standards although better than nothing.I must be extra critical of the food. I expected better froma 5 star resort. Interesting choices, although often poorly prepared, likely by non-chefs trying their hands at cooking. Most sauces were from gallon-sized cans of food-service supplies.  I got a bad case of food poisoning, which put a damper on things--many other guests were also ill. I suspect it was from cross contamination or poor food-handling, as these concepts may not be readily familiar to the Dominicans.

<Content>relax at the Majestic I just came back from this resort anf I must say I had a very relaxing 7 days. The beach, pool and hotel ammenities were good. The staff friendly and accomodating, do not believe other reviews that fault the service!!! It is a new resort and some things need fine tunning.It never felt crowded and the restaurants were very good, you must understand that this is the Dominican Republic and most of the foods and all drinks were national...but thet were fine, the price for this all-inclusive vacation can't be beaten anywhere else in the Caribbean. If you decide to visit this resort you won't regret the decision.

<Content>Majestic Colonial Just returned from my trip stayed at the Majestic from July 30 to June 8. The resort is beautiful. The rooms are excellent except for the bathroom no privacy. The pool is the best I've seen. It is huge and there is always a place to sit. The beach was also beautiful you could always find a place to sit whether in the shade or in the sun. The resort is big and there are alot of things to do. The employees were very friendly the front desk was extremely helpful. The gym was nice the trainer Cesar was excellent, very friendly and helpful. The kids club was ok, kids did not want to stay there after the first day. The shows were ok my niece liked them but she's only 10, I've seen better. The food and drinks were ok not much variation. But still a great trip would return.

<Content>LOVED IT!!!!!!! Just returned from my trip and miss it already (was there June 24- July 1 2006). Best place to visit. The hotel was beautiful, clean and well kept. The food was very good and you had a lot to choose from and of course excellent drinks. Make sure to make reservations at the restaurants when you first get there. It was nice and peaceful laying out by the pool and beach all day. All of the staff are very friendly and the entertainment staff was very very fun. You must check out the Michael Jackson show, it was my favorite. After every show head over to the disco for dancing. The staff from the shows are there to dance and boy they can dance!!!!!!!!! Had fun dancing at the disco with all of you....thanks guys!!!!! I would definitely recommend staying here to everyone and would love and hope to go back.

<Content>Majestic...Majestic!!!!!!!!!!!! Planning our (six couples) trip to Punta Cana began in January. Having researched many resorts, our group made the decision to stay at the Majestic Colonial. Periodically, we checked the reviews about the resort and often wondered if we had indeed made the correct decision. Excitement grew as our departure date drew closer. After arriving at the Punta Cana airport, we were immediately taken to the our hotel. The Majestic was truly ............Majestic!! The lobby, the grounds, the rooms, the beach, the pool............all were extremely clean and inviting......8 days of paradise!!!! We had an ocean front room with a king bed, a jacuzzi inside as well as outside, a well stocked cooler, a handy safe, and were just steps from the huge pool and white sandy beach. What more could one want?? The food was quite good and the buffets offered many different dishes. Something for everyone! The steak and seafood by the beach was very tasty, and we ate there more than once. I would highly reccommend the Japanese restaurant as well. Food was not a problem even though some dishes were foreign to us. The waiters and waitresses were always trying to please and were ever so friendly. My husband and I celebrated our birthdays during our stay and believe me.............the staff made both days special complete with cake and drink !!!!! The beach was just as I had pictured it............breathtaking blue water and sand as white as can be. Post card perfect!!! We never had any trouble securing a lounge or 6 huts near one another. We enjoyed the pool and swim up bar in the afternoons. Blue Hawaiians........yum!After a late dinner, there was always the option of a show, a trip to the casino, or just hanging out in the lobby bar or the open air bar with live music. We never did visit the disco....too tired from all the sun and sand.Buying souveniers was difficult, however. The little shops in the resort were very limited. And if you are over 50 and slightly overweight, I suggest you leave the tubing to the younger slimmer guests. Although It did provide our group and much of the island with a good laugh!!!I really enjoyed the mix of people.........it definitely made our stay more interesting. It does help if you speak a little Spanish, but we were lucky as one of our Club members is fluent in Spanish and could help us out when necessary. We also took along some extra cash so we would be able to tip the much deserving staff.Before we knew it, it was time to leave the DR. This vacation was relaxing and memorable. Great place, great time, great friends. Did we make the right decision by booking the Majestic Colonial? You bet!!!

<Content>WOW, WOW, WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! We just returned from paradise. We stayed in the Majestic with 2 little kids (8 months and 2 1/2 year) for 15 days. It was incredible. The hotel was amazing, so beautiful. RoomsThe rooms are extremely spacious, even with 2 extra kids in the room. First they gave us room 1310. We overlooked the parking of the Majestic and the entree of the resort next to ours. Not really what we hoped for, but well... But at night the kids couldn't sleep because of the noise of the theater of the resort next to us. Next day we asked for an other room, and they gave us room 3244. This room had sea and poolview. That added an extra 10% of joy to our holiday, we were a lot in the room because of the kids taking a nap. What I should mention is that it was damp in the room, accompagnied with the damp-smell. That wasn't so in the other room. But well, we took it for granted. So if you want a good room, here is what you should know: There are two buildings, the 1xxx and 2xxx rooms are in the first, the 3xxx and 4xxx in the second. The x1xx number indicates the level and the xx44 number is you roomnumber. The 1xxx rooms are on the back and for most part facing the other hotel and the parkinglot. The higher roomnumbers may have seaview, but I'm not sure. The 2xxx are facing the pool. The 21xx are on the groundfloor and have straight acces to the pool. Those rooms have a jucuzzi on the terras. The higher 2xxx rooms also have seaview. The 3xxx rooms are also facing the pool, but without the easy acces on the ground floor. And the 4xxx rooms are facing palmtreas. The higher 3xxx and 4xxx rooms also have seaview. Ok, enough about the rooms. FoodThe food was great and we never got sick. We ate about anything. So did our oldest girl. We ate a lot in the buffetrestaurants because of the kids. But we also visited Taino, the carribean restaurant, the tepanjaki restaurant, chinese restaurant with sushibar and the steakhouse. We loved the sushi. Our youngest got sick though, but we think that was due to swallowing lots of water in the pool. But if you'can't find anything you like, what I think is hard to believe, you'd better stay at home. We travelled a lot and never found such luxerious restaurants in an all-in resort. KidsAbout bringing small kids. Don't, if you don't like lots of attention. Of people touching you kids, speaking to them, taking them for a walk through the restaurant, or behind the bar. But this proud mum loved it, and so did our little one. The oldest is a bit shy. And the people. They are so nice. They are happy to please you. I can mention some names, but I will do wrong to those not mentioned. They all made us feel so welcome.Other guestMost guest come from the US. Just a few from different parts of europe. We met so many nice people. Beach and poolSuper!!!!! Nice green-blue sea. Beautiful white beach. Incredible large pool. We don't like participating in games, but we found enough quiet places. We were happily to find almost no-one putting towels on the chairs on the beach and by the pool. We usually went for a swim at 11 a.m. and always had choice of many shadow places. Never had a problem. Oh, and I didn't mention swimming in the shadow near the Spa. Great for kids and in case you got a sunburn. TheaterWe didn't watch that much shows. But the once we visited were great. Lots of musquitos though, so use repelent. We all loved the live music that was in the theater almost every night. Other barsSuper. We loved to sit on the patio. Just drinking some nice vino rossado or a margarita. And the wetbar is also very nice in the daytime. The gardenBeautiful. And in the evening, the lights just made it a fairy tale. SightseeingWe rented a car for a day and drove into the hills. The roads are very bad, but it's so nice going there. Beautiful nature, people so nice, almost no tourist visiting. Try visiting a local store. They don't speak english and I don't speak spanish, but that's no problem. It's that we never visit a place for a second time. To many places in the world to see. But I'd recommend it to any-one else.

<Content>Over all a good Place I just stayed there for this memorial day weekend. Overall i liked it and will return.First the goods:The resort is beautiful.The pool is great and huge.Rooms are clean and new,Grounds, loved it; the loby is amazingAll rooms start at junior suits, so you will have alot of space.The beach was my favorite. The sand was clean and soft. The resort has a big coral reef in front, so the water is calm.The water sports are included, especially my fav, the catamaran which you do not need a captain. Most other resorts do require it. Just the first lesson after that you are on your own.Bads:Bathrooms are not fully covered. So if you like your privacy, becareful with whom your room.Food not good, as expected.The doors are not sealed so you can hear outside perfect.Aircondition blows pretty low,I had mine check constantly finally i justgot used to it. I guess coming from miami your use to one full blast all the times.So over all i liked the place. I will return. It's a great place to go with a group of friends, just becarefull who you room with you have that whole privacy issue. You will not have a place to change alone, other than the shower although it is very spacious. And the food expect what you pay for. It's not horrilbe, and its not the best. I recomend the chrasco at the steakhouse and the jap restaurant.

<Content>Awesome time I had an awesome time here... It was a 40th birthday surprise and was it a memorable one. Everything about this place was beyond my expectations in a resort...The grounds and beach were paradise. I would recommend this place to anybody thinking of going to the Dominican....Thanks again baby, you are the best

<Content>Two thumbs up ! I would like to begin by thanking Aurelio Sanchez for answering all of my pre stay questions and ensuring that while at the Majestic my stay was nothing less that perfect. With that said, let us begin the review. Room #1 Majestic Swimout Suite (2146)In a word, great. The room location could not have been better. It is located directly across from the Wet Bar and pool activities. Most importantly, it is less than a 3 minute walk to the beach. The furnishings were very nice (taupe color wood) and both indoor and outdoor Jacuzzis filled up fast and the jets worked well. The airconditioning and fridge both functioned properly and there was no mold smell to contend with. Pillows while flat did the job. I would also like to mention that there were no bugs or critters of any kind to be found either inside the room or on the patio. Maid Service was always good and always early, usually around 9am and the mini bar never lacked anything. I was disappointed when I had to move to....Room #2 Majestic Oceanfront Jacuzzi Suite (2152)Now you're probably wandering why I would be disappointed in an upgrade of this calibur? It's pretty simple, I had to walk a few steps to the pool and wade over to the bar ! Seriously though, the room was absolutely beautiful and huge ! In addition to being larger and having a very slightly obstructed view, the furnishings were Mahogony wood as opposed to the taupe color in the swimout. Airconditioning, fridge, Jacuzzis all in working order. FYI, if booking a Oceanfront, try to get one on the 2nd floor for a less obstructed view. As with the 1st room, Maid service was good and always by 9 or so... Daytime/Nightime EntertainmentThere are theme nights each night of the week at the theatre ie: Latin, International, Michael Jackson, Couples contests etc. Folks, keep in mind that this is not Vegas. If you go with an open mind, grab a cocktail and relax it will be an enjoyable evening. I have to say that the talent of some of the dancers is amazing and these guys work their butts off for us on a nightly basis. Yes the shows are kind of corny but hey, it's all inclusive. After the show you are urged to go to the disco, don't bother. Seriously. It is the place where fed up parents send their kids. The Anamacion Team gets the party started during the day and they do a damn good job. Activities range from Spanish classes in the morning to Sexiest Man contests in the afternoon. There is something for every taste. The guys refuse to let you be bored or have less than a good time. My personal favorite was aerobics both on the beach and at the pool. Really fun and a good workout. Special shout out to sandy, Billy and Sexy Papi Felix. Thank you for making me enjoy myself.Resturants/FoodThis is a very subjective topic. The food ranged on any given day from average to excellent. My personal favorites were Taino and the Lobster place. The Gourmet and Matsuri really were nice, food not as good as I expected but still ok. The Buffet was really good if you get there when it first opens. Avoid eggs at all cost. Note: I did not get sick during my 8 day stay and did not notice flies in any of the eating establishments. Another piece of advice is that if you get hungry really late at night Taino stays open until 6am.BeachGreat. Lots of chairs and palapas. No need to wake up at the crack of dawn to reserve a seat. It did not occur at all. If I have left anything out or if you have additional questions, feel free to email me. Do not hesitate to book the Majestic.Cynthia

You can eat a lot or another choice is that you can go to the buffet restaurants with an enormous choise of food.They are very big,with a good service and a yamy yamy food. THE BEACH: The beach is amazing.The sand is very clean and gets not overheated during the day so you don't burn your feet.There are a lot of palmtrees and umbrellas on the beach to get some shade. The relax chairs on the beach and the pool are very comfortable. The beach is also kept clean by the gardeners from the hotel, even when there's a lot of seaweed on the beach.The beach is also very spacious and quied.The shows: I loved all the shows but the best was the Michael Jackson performance.My voice was gone on that night but was so much fun.But all the shows are nice and funny and the great part is when you dance tachi tachi at the end of every show with the Animation group and another visitors.THE ANIMATION GROUP: Seriously the wonderful part for me was the animation group.They are amazing and now they are my family.All the day I stayed with them and have fun.

<Content>Traveled to Punta Cana several times, Majestic is not a 5-star resort We enjoyed our vacation in Punta Cana, as we always do. Initially, my family was excited about staying at the Majestic (new 5-star resort). During our 7-night stay, we realized the overall service  food selection gave it far less ratings. Otherwise, the overall resort was beautiful, including the pool  beach. I have summarized a list of Pro's  Con's for your reference:Positives: Massive pool area, breathtaking beach, above average suite (room), above average nightly shows, friendly entertainment staff, didn't have any problems with bugs, above average grounds  cleaniness.Negatives: Exactly the same food selection for every meal in typical restaurants, extremely poor service in restaurants (no drinks or refills - mostly had to get yourself, if thirsty), room smells moldy  damp, not a good variety of drinks, refridgerator in room barely keeps drinks cool, some staff wanted a hand-out for any type of service, staff never went out of their way to please their customers, and weak casino. (Overall resort rating = 3.5 stars).During our walk on the beach, we toured another newly constructed resort (RIU Palace - 5 stars ++), it was hands-down rated higher than Majestic. Being a new resort, they may have similar service problems, but it seemed extremely nice. Overall, keep in mind, you are visiting another country, the food doesn't taste nearly the same as home. Typically, it is overlooked because you are in paradise. Our previous vacations to Punta Cana include: Paradisus Spa Resort  Casino (better overall quality than Majestic) and Breezes Punta Cana.

<Content>Relaxed at The Majestic Husband and I stayed for 8 days 6/4-6/12. Check in was absolutely wonderful. Had emailed the resort ahead of time and asked for 2nd or 3rd floor and got 3rd floor with pool  semi ocean view--great room. Resort and grounds are very pretty. Once the foliage grows it will be magnificent! A few problems with construction--for example some of the concrete walkways are already being repaired. The place was totally immaculate! Everytime you went into a bathroom, there was a maid behind you mopping up. Maid service for our room was tremendous. We called houskeeping when we 1st got there and asked for our room to be made up early during our stay and it was done every day before 11am! We did tip our maid every day ($3) and we did bring some little gifts for her children. Our in room bar service was also wonderful. Never had to call for refills--automatically refilled what had been used, including the free champagne. Service at all the bars and the restaurants was wonderful. Always had a smile on their faces and again, we did tip at all meals ($2-3) and maybe a $1 a drink or so. Not every single drink but often enough that the servers knew our faces! Food was very good. Neither of us are big buffet people but the buffets here were better than any buffets that we have ever had at any of the many AI's we have been to. Very fresh, hot/cold and no flies/insects that other people have complained of. The sit down restaurants were also very good. We ate at every restaurant so I will leave my email at the end of this review if anyone has any questions for me. Drinks were okay. I liike a good glass of wine and the wine included in the AI package was so-so. The sweet drinks were okay. We managed very well at finding something everyday to drink. My husband likes Vodka Tonic and they never seemed to have any Tonic so he says he is going to open up a tonic factory there--he'd probably make a fortune. Beach  water was absolutely beautiful! Constructive Criticism: The resort has 2 bars open every day at the beach end of the pool. There are 2 more bars at the lobby end (quiet end) of the pool but they were never opened the entire time we were there and the resort was pretty much full the last 4 days we were there. We got pretty bored with the animation team screaming for people to join them and went down to the quiet end but couldn't get a drink down there unless you went into the lobby soaking wet which I was not comfortable doing and it was quite a hike from the pool! Also ( and this is not the fault of the resort), there were a lot of kids at the swim up pool bar just hogging all the seats and splashing water into our drinks and jumping from the little tree islands, getting dirt into the pool. Now, their parents did nothing about this. I think that with a pool this size, there should be an adult only section, with a bar. And by the way, the pool is the prettiest we have seen! Shows were so loud that we could not watch them--too bad because these kids work so hard on them but my hearing is not worth losing!  Our last full day at the resort was a little rough because my husband got stuck in the lobby elevator!! He was the only one on it and no one knew how to get him out!! It was about 90-95deg that afternoon and he was soaking wet from sweat. There wasn't any clear message in the elevator as to what to do in an emergency! Thank God it is glass because I think if it weren't he would have really panicked! He finally started pushing every button in the elevator and it must have put a light on above the outside of the elevator becasue a bunch of staff members came over and tried to pry the doors open. After about a half hour, they had the doors open about 18 inches and they literally pulled him out! It was such a small space that they had to take his glasses off for fear of breaking them! He was dripping wet when it was all over! They were apologetic about this but you would have thought that a manager would have followed up with us to see if he was okay! Not a phone call--nothing! That was a little disappointing when speaking of service. Sorry this is so long but if any questions please feel free to email me at susiet@twcny.rr.com

<Content>AMAZING the best out of 8 My family and i enjoyed a 14 day stay at the majestic. its by far the best resort we've been to out of 8 4-5 star resorts. Food: The food was great i definetly recomend the carabean a la carte restaurant they have amazing steak and fajitahs. As for the buffet it was delicious!! there was everything: pasta meats fruits vegtables...pretty much anything u could ask for nothing to complain about here!Rooms: The rooms were very nice but our maid didnt always do a good job....we tipped her 2 dollars and a toy from dollarama everyday:) and she still forgot to leave us toilet paper and other useful things. I also found that the bathroom wasnt private enough...it feels like your stuck in a closet to use the bathroom and people that are in your room can hear everything. The beds were not that comfterble but we all had good night sleepsPool  Beach: The pool was amazing. It was huge. i tried to swim from one end to the other and got tired half ways. It was very clean and the perfect temperature (refreshing) concidering we had 100 degree weather the whole time. The beach was nice the waves were pretty high most of the time, but when the ocean was rough the water got full of weeds.i ould definetly return to this resort in the futut i highly recomend majestic colonial

<Content>Paradise at Last !!! My husband and I stayed at Majestic from May 27-30th. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary. I had read alot on Tripadvisor before choosing this hotel and we are so glad we did. We loved it. From the moment we arrived. It was so relaxing and peaceful. The beach was beautiful. Plenty of Palapas and the pool was eternal. There is also a nice spa and if you like you can also have a massage by the beach. The evenings were very romantic , with the trails and pools softly lit and the piano and saxophone playing some nice jazz at the Plaza. The Breakfast was great, What a broad selection. They have some stations where you can order omelettes and even Crepes! Now, my husband is french and he said the crepes were very good and authentic taste. The lunch buffet next to the beach was nice. Your basic choices...though if you are looking for the best meals, You should return there in the evening , when it's turned into a romantic setting Steakhouse and seafood restaurant. We also tried Le Gourmet (must reserve the moment you checkin) and found the food and the service to be great. It was elegant and the service was very attentive ,just like at a luxury restaurant. It was just the setting we were looking for to celebrate a romantic anniversary evening. The evening shows are ok. But the Michael Jackson one was great. Dont' miss it! Michael (heehee) Jackson. Hahaha (you'll see what I mean) The maid had prepared our jacuzzi with beautiful fresh flowers and towels shaped like 2 swans forming a heart shape in the middle. Thanks!Overall a great vacation. P.S. I never saw a woman working at the reception. Only men. I usually find female receptionists to be friendlier. Just a thought for the owner/management : )

<Content>Very Nice - the Majestic We stayed at the Majestic Colonial 5/24/06 through 5/28/06, it is a beautiful resort. We paid the extra to stay on the beach it was well worth it. However, the down fall is that it is a long walk (I just tore my ACL) back to the main entrance and where the majority of the restaurants are located. Even though the resort is new the quality of workmanship could be better. We were not sure if it was the lack of expertise located on the island or what. Just small things in our room, like caulking, trim and tile.The rooms have a small smell but I brought a candle and it worked well for me. I also brought a pillow because theirs were so thin.We spent time at the spa for messages which were great, you must try them.

<Content>Absolutely amazing!! My husband and I just got back three days ago and are already planning the next time we can get back. This place is great! It just opened November 17 of last year, so there are tiny little kinks they have to work out...but none of them affected our vacation at all. I think it was a huge bonus because there weren't any huge crowds or lines for towels. The food was plentiful and very good, the people are amazingly friendly, the rooms are gorgeous, the beaches fantastic and the pool terrific. Yeah, we liked it! After reading several reviews before choosing our destination, we had seen that many people recommended seeing the Michael Jackson show. Well, I'm NOT a show person. I don't go to them. But, my husband convinced me and we had a blast!! The costumes and dancing were great! After that we went to the disco and danced forever. A vacation anywhere can be bad, good or great. It's all in what you are willing to put into it to achieve that result. We went planning to have a great time, and we did. It's a definitely great resort that will only improve with age.

<Content>At resort now. Absolutly beautiful resort, but hot and humid! We are presently at the resort. Had a little problem when we first arrived but the management quickly corrected the problems. Read previously that you shouldn't get bottom floor rooms. This may only pertain to rooms that are closest to ocean at end of resort. There was a musty smell and small looking fruit flies. However, spoke to people closer to the front of resort and none have or had this problem. We changed our room and are extremely happy. There was a problem with the a/c that was corrected on Monday. Seems like the a/c repair people don't work on week-ends. Smell gone now, might have been because of the a/c being broken. This resort is almost completed. Small details almost done. They are correcting a problem with the cement that is around the pool. They are doing it in sections so not to disturb the guests. They started working on a section next to where we were lounging yesterday. Never even knew or cared that they were there. It's sooooo beautiful here. We sat at the restaurant closest to the gorgeous ocean the second day we were here. I was so overwelmed by how beautiful it was, it literely made me cry. Can't believe I'm in a place so breathtaking. We are in our 50's. Great mix of all age groups. Rooms are spacious and very well decorated. Lots of cool marble in beautiful hues of gold and oranges. Beautiful cherry cabinetry. Grounds are gorgeous and well maintained. Tropical and architectual eye candy everwhere. Wonderful staff - very attentive. Get selection of restaurants. Food is very good. Too much to mention, I could be here all day just telling you but would rather continue to enjoy the rest of my vacation. One thing I would like to make you aware of. It's extremely humid here. Drink lots of water. Any questions. E-mail me.

<Content>Magnificent Majestic Just returned yesterday from the Majestic Colonial (May 11-16) and I can only sum it up in one word...Magnificent! I may not be a world traveler but this resort offers everything a person could want or need. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, the pool is fantastic and the beach will take your breath away. The way the resort is designed made it easy to find your way around quickly. The hotel management does a great job in keeping the grounds of the resort in perfect and spotless condition (no trash, cigarette butts, etc.)Upon check in, which only took minutes, we were escorted to our room. My husband and I had an ocean front room (2253) and we do not regret paying for the upgrade. The view and location was worth every cent. The room was huge and the bathroom area beautiful. I can see how the set up of the room with the open bath area may be a problem for families, but for a couple it is great. I had read previous reviews regarding restaurant reservations being difficult to get, but had absolutely no problems. Some staff are friendlier than others but that is no different anywhere you go. I was surprised at how many of the staff spoke fairly good English and communication was never a problem. The food at the resort may not be 5-star by American standards but being that it is an island I felt the food to be fine. The breakfast buffet had many choices - I recommend the made to order omelets and crullers and the coffee was excellent. Some of the items were a little on the cold side but keep in mind the quantity needed to serve many people at one time. We never ate at the buffet for any other meals but breakfast so I cannot really give an opinion for food served at lunch or dinner. Since we spent so much time at the beach, if we ate lunch we ate at the beach restaurant. The selection included hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken, pasta and a salad bar. At dinnertime, we went to the Gourmet, Japanese (wonderful), steakhouse and seafood restaurants near the beach. Our favorite restaurant was the Taino which served a Dominican buffet/Mexican menu. The fajitas were probably some of the best I ever had and my husband loved the Dominican food especially the goat stew! The staff was extremely friendly and lots of fun. We spoke with a few other people and we were all in agreement that the Taino was an under rated treasure! We did not experience any sickness from the food at all. One lady we met had a little problem but for the most part everyone we spoke to had no illness issues.The only negative comment that I can make about the Majestic was the inconsistent cleaning of the room and the stocking of the mini-fridge. Some days our room was cleaned by 11:00 a.m. One day, my husband had to call when our room was not cleaned by 4:30 p.m. and the response from housekeeping was immediate. It was our understanding that when they have a large number of people who check out those rooms are cleaned first for new arrivals. The only issue I had was that I wanted to take an afternoon nap and was afraid that the maid would come in to clean the room. I don't quite understand the inconsistent stocking of the mini-fridge. Some people had no problem and even got extra sodas and beer. We had to call two times in our 5-day stay to have fridge restocked with water and beer. My husband asked for extra beer and did not get it. Other guests would get extra beer with no problem. We used quite a bit of bottled water not just for drinking but for brushing our teeth. I must say that brushing your teeth with bottled water is not as easy as it sounds! As far as nightlife goes, Punta Cana is pretty tame compared to some place like Cancun. There are nightly shows, casino and disco. Punta Cana is the place to go if you want to just relax and take it easy.Our stay at the Majestic was wonderful. We caught a glimpse of some of the other resorts and I must say that Majestic was by far superior. Being a new resort was a plus in my book. If you want to relax, enjoy a wonderful beach and be surrounded by lovely grounds, the Majestic is for you.

<Content>Wonderful time at the Majestic Colonial Like many others, we were skeptical about staying at the Majestic based on all of the reviews. We booked our Honeymoon back in September/October 2005. As soon as we arrived all of my concerns were gone. The hotel lobby is magnificent. We arrived around 4:30 p.m. and were quickly taken to our room, #1407 - building 1, on the 4th floor facing another resort. We had two balconies, one with a huge Jacuzzi tub that was extremely private. We were a quick walk to the main buffet and to the pool. We enjoyed the quiet part of the resort and were very glad not to have a room by the pool.The main buffet was great for breakfast. The omelet station is definitely good. I would say that whenever you have the opportunity for them to prepare the food for you, your better off. My husband and I also enjoyed the pasta station immensely, but have them cook it for you and add fresh vegetables, etc. We ate at Le Gourmet twice and enjoyed the lobster and the filet mignon. We also ate at the Japanese Steakhouse once and thought it was decent, but we were in no rush to go back. We did enjoy the sushi at the Chinese restaurant. The buffet at the Caribbean restaurant was good and we enjoyed the salsa bar immensely. We did try the Seafood restaurant at the beach one night and were extremely disappointed. Needless to say, we did not go back there. We did enjoy the main buffet for dinner when we didn鈥檛 have reservations at another restaurant.The housekeeper came everyday (she even fixed my bathing suit) and cleaned up our room. We did tip periodically about $1 to $2, although it was not at all necessary; it was more something we wanted to do. We also tipped at dinner in the restaurants that required reservations and to the bartenders we visited frequently.As far as the drinks were concerned, they do have Smirnoff, Johnny Walker, J  B, etc. that do not cost extra, but you have to ask for them. We found the bartenders at the wet bar and the large bar near the restaurants (Lidio and Mike) were the best. They will make you anything you like and if for some reason you don鈥檛 like the drink tell them and order another one. We also brought our own insulated mugs and they had no problem filling them up. The shows were fine and some were more entertaining than others, but we by no means were expecting Broadway or Vegas style shows. Take them for what they are and you'll enjoy them. The Michael Jackson show was very good, even if you're not a fan.We did not experience much of a language barrier at all. As some others have said, you are not in the U.S. or Canada and their native language is not English. We brought a Spanish dictionary that was not at all needed. If you attempt to speak their language they will do their best to speak yours. A lot of them do speak English so I wouldn鈥檛 worry about that at all.We also brought our Sirius satellite radio receiver, antenna and home docking kit with the hope that we could pick up stations. It worked and we really enjoyed having it after hearing Spanish music most of the time. We just took our antenna out on the deck and hooked up the receiver through the front TV inputs. Worked like a charm. Also, bring your own pillows, the pillows they provide are as thick as a sheet. They are awful. You will be very glad you brought your own. The snorkeling off the beach is ok; if you want to just see some pretty fish, then it is good. The left side and the right side of the roped off area in the ocean are the best places to see the fish. Bring your own mask and snorkel. Also bring some bread into the water and the fish will swarm around you. To experience the culture of the Dominican Republic we took the Bavaro Runners Safari day trip. It was $81 U.S. per person, but we very much enjoyed the trip and thought it was money well spent. We visited sugar cane fields and a tobacco museum where they showed us how they make cigars. You will also travel to a typical Dominican home where you鈥檒l learn how they make chocolate and coffee which I thought was extremely interesting and tasty. My favorite part of this excursion was the horseback riding along the beach. It had been at least 20 years since I had been horseback riding and this was the perfect environment to try it again.The resort is most definitely suited for couples. It is the perfect spot for beautiful weather and if you just want to RELAX which is exactly what we did. We would definitely go back.

<Content>Perfect - Ingnore the Complainers - Hello Ricky Let me start by saying that we had a wonderful time on our trip. We wouldn鈥檛 change a thing about it. I would like to begin by addressing a few things that I had read on here before our trip. The bugs/insects are not that big of a deal. We brought bug spray, but only used it a couple times. It definitely doesn鈥檛 hurt to bring it though. We were able to live with them. There were no more bugs than you would find in Oklahoma for example. The beds and pillows were not as nice as I would have preferred, but they were not an issue. The pillows were perfect for me, so my wife used 3 and was fine. She normally uses 2 back home anyway. I don鈥檛 know what people were talking about when they complained about the food. It was great. I wish I had been able to eat more. My wife and I found ourselves getting small portions of many different items at the buffets. That way we could try the different things. My favorite restaurant was 鈥淟e Gourmet/French鈥? We ate there twice. Reservations for both places were not a problem, we made the 2nd reservation for the French place halfway into our stay and only 1 day in advance. The hotel did not appear to be very full. Make sure you pay attention to the list of restaurant times to find out when and where the different types of food will be. We were never hungry. As I mentioned before, I wish I had been hungry so I could go try the different foods. If you have a picky eater in your bunch, I suggest the 鈥淚nternational Buffet.鈥?That place had more food than you could shake a stick at. Also, the drinks were great. Of course, we got a couple drinks that were not mixed the way we liked, but that was only a couple of the many drinks we had. That type of thing happens anywhere so I laugh and the people who complained, in fact, I laughed about the complaints people had in general. We had nothing that was significant enough to be unhappy about. I think some people just like to complain. The beer tastes EXACTLY like 鈥淒os Equis鈥?in the green bottle. The white and red house wines are great. Now understand, they are not $50 bottles of wine, but they are very enjoyable. I have had some cheap wines in my day and these are not them. We had a great room (4246), I don鈥檛 think the view could have been better. If you want an awesome view of the beach and ocean. I highly recommend this 2nd floor room. Also, it is not hard to communicate. Most of the employees know a fair amount of English and if they don鈥檛鈥?they are quick to flag down someone who does. This didn鈥檛 matter to me much since I speak decent Spanish. The dancing at the shows was great. We were in a couples contest in front of the whole auditorium on Monday night the 8th of May. We won! We had to dance, etc. The place were you get snorkels, etc. closes and 4 and you have to get your stuff by 3pm. Plan ahead. SCUBA diving was great. Now to my most memorable part of the trip, the employees. I made friends with a guy by the name of Ricky/Rickey. He is part of the entertainment team. They setup dance lessons on the beach, games, and they dance in the disco at night and lead conga lines, etc. Ricky wears huge sunglasses with one lens missing and a red nose stud. The way he greats people is also distinct, he does almost like a tiger claw at you. Then you interlock your fingers with him and do it back to him. When you see it, you will know what I am talking about. That is his equivalent to a high five or the 鈥渉itting fists handshake鈥?in the states. I was so sad to have to say goodbye to him. I miss him deeply. Something about him stuck with me and I will never forget him. I think he felt the same way, I could see it in his eyes. Please, if you read this and see him (he is in the disco from around 11pm to 12pm or on the beach or pool leading games/activites), and trust me鈥?He is hard to miss. Please, tell him 鈥淢ark and Erin from the US鈥?say hello. He knows of this website so if you tell him you saw me write this here, he will know what you are talking abouot. We exchanged contact info and we are going to write each other soon. He will know exactly who you are talking about. We spent a lot of time with him. It will mean so much to him and me. Another fun experience was with the bartender in the casino (Tony?) and his sister the waitress in the casino. He is a pretty muscular guy, real clean cut, friendly. By the way, he makes killer Amaretto Sours. We visited often and we became pretty good friends with them also. So, on the last day, we hugged and said our goodbyes, and he said something in Spanish that I didn鈥檛 understand. It had something to do with 鈥淗e will鈥?and 鈥渢he airplane trip home.鈥?After a lot of gesturing, I still didn鈥檛 understand what he was saying. So he began to draw on the back of a coaster, at first it was a stick figure, then the most touching thing happened. He drew angel wings and a halo on the stick figure and it was clear. He was saying he would pray for us to have a safe flight. He and basically everyone else there, work 14 hour days, 12 days in a row and stay on the resort property to sleep. Then they go home for 3 days to be with their families. That being said, I was disgusted with some of the guests who would be rude to these hard working, kind people. Tips are not expected as they are in the States, they are happy to get one, but if you don鈥檛 tip, the quality of your service does not diminish as it would here. We brought perfume samples to give out as gifts to people we made friends with. They seemed to go over well. Also, people seem to have a lot of kids down there, you may consider bringing crayons or child related gifts.

<Content>no problems here I travel four times a year to the Carribean, always stay at 5 star resorts, and have done so for the past 15 years. I think this is definitely a 5 star resort. The cement problems around the pool are being fixed, the food was great, many people can have upset stomachs and this is no reflection on the food being bad, take something for it ie. immodium, I gained 6 pounds while I was here. No problems communicating with the staff, if your waiter speaks to you in Spanish tell him you speak English and most have no problems switching to English. The service in the restaurants was extremely fast, ate at all the restaurants and can't pick which one I liked the best, they were all good. There is a waiter in the Steakhouse that literally runs to bring you your food. The bar service is exceptional in all the bars, drinks are made exactly how you like and if you try a drink and don't like it, no problem to order something else. No need to order top shelf alcohol, once you add all the rest of the ingredients it all tastes the same and so is the end result if you drink enough. Thanks to Lidio and Michael at the main bar and for taking the great pictures IN the fountain, too many Mamajaunas!!! Animation staff were great, very friendly, gotta love Jose's hair. No problems getting chairs in the shade no matter what time of day at the pool or beach. I had to laugh if I went for a morning walk at sunrise and people were out claiming their chairs, I never went to get a chair unless I planned on sitting in it at the time , I would get to the beach 3 or 4 hours later and still get a perfect spot. No problem with the privacy thing for the bathrooms if it's an issue for you use the hotel bathrooms there is enough of them and usually no one in them or make and excuse to go back to your room and have your privacy. I can't understand what people here complained about, anyone who came in on my flight that I noticed had any problem were the ones who also didn't show up for orientation where you usually get some helpful info no matter how many times you travel.

<Content>Can't anyone see??? The things that are supposed to be beautiful are very beautiful. And very many things were. What we (my husband and I) have a problem with is how can this be a five star resort if the place is falling apart already. Hasn't any one noticed the cement around a good size area of the pool is in pieces? That in it self seems very hazardous. We were on the third floor and I still can't get the smell of the room out of the clothes. The quilty of construction is very very poor (way too many to mention) and untill they fix those problems this resort shouldn't be a five star. Don't get me wrong we had a very relaxing time because that's what we came to do and we were together. But we will not come back.We wait to long for vacations, to pay good hard earn money on what looks beautiful but really isn't.Please do not be influenced by my review I don't mean to say it is a bad place. Just being truthful about what we thought and saw.

<Content>had a great time Just a short note to confirm the mostly positive reviews written over the past 6- 8 weeks.After a clearly rough start it's very apparent the management is working extremely hard to have the resort become one of the best in the DR.I feel that most folks who complain have unrealistic expectations of what a resort in the DR is or should be. This is not Aruba or any other Caribbean country; it's the DR with a clearly different economy  culture. To assume it will be the same as some other island's resort is unrealistic. The facilities, staff, food  service were all top notch as compared to other AI resorts in the DR.

<Content>The best ever in ten years Being a regular all-inclusive vacantioner since 1996.....When you look at the big picture, the Majestic was the best we ever had in 11 different resorts we've been too....From Jamaica, Varadero, Cancun and also another time in Punta Cana, this one was by far the best with the staff trying hard to please the client and this with a big smile.....I will not write about how the food, rooms, service and beaches were because you can read everything about this in other reviews.....There is only one thing to say is that if after being at the Majestic for a week or two, and you don't like it....NEVER travel again in an all-inclusive resort and stay home, because it's not for you......Eric  Wendy

<Content>Still New! Stayed at the Majestic from April 23 until April 28th. When we arrived they did not have a room for us (we also paid for an up-grade room) and shuttled us to a nearby resort for the nite. Took us three hours to get into a room at the other resort and by that time we were exhausted and not happy campers. NExt day we got into a room at the Majestic by three o'clock. So, we felt we lost a whole day of vacation...manager, Linda was very nice and they did give us some complimentary services, but our vacation started off on the wrong foot.Had we not stayed at Secrets in October, where everything was just perfect, we probably would have been more acceptable to the situation.After that first day we throughly enjoyed the resort and its amenities. The food was good, staff was very courteous and efficient. The resort is maintained well and still in its early stages, but quiet beautiful. Honeymooners or first time vacationers will love the Majestic and have a great time and I recommend it.AS for us, we would most likely go back to Secrets, since our experience with Secrets in Mexico and Punta Cana were above average and expectations.

<Content>Loved the Majestic My husband and I, along with some friends, just returned from the Majestic Colonial. After reading the reviews everyday up until the time I left, I was very nervous about staying here. We have been traveling for the past 15 years to the Carribean and I must say this is one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in. Yes, you must overlook some of the workmanship, but the hotel is beautiful, the pool was awesome and the beach is spectacular. We never had any trouble finding a hut and did not play the towel game. The staff went out of their way to help you, they are all so friendly, and try very hard to speak English. If we tried to speak spanish to them, they tried to speak English to us. The food was good for an all-inclusive. If you could not find anything here to eat, stay home. The steakhouse and the Japanese were the best. The service was a bit slow at the steakhouse, but give them time. It will improve. There are people working all over the hotel 24/7, gardening and keeping it clean. You will not be dissapointed. Go with an open mind, relax, and you will have an absolutely great time. Say hi to the boys at the beach bar!!

<Content>Fabulous Week April 21-28, 2006 We just returned from the Majestic Colonial and found it to be outstanding! We flew out of Boston directly into Punta Cana and cleared the airport with no problems. When we got to the hotel we checked in with no problems and when we got to our rooms we were pleasantly surprised, they were beautiful. Our room faced the gardens and our friends had a majestic suite with the Jacuzzi on the patio and could walk right out to the pool. After reading reviews about having to purchase top shelf alcohol we were very worried but after a few drinks we found it to be not so bad, there were plenty of options. We found the piano bar in the lobby not to be so busy and the 3-11 bar tender was great, he would even do shots with the guys. Also the bartender in the morning/afternoon at the beach bar was great, when he saw us walk in he would start making what the guys always ordered. The food was great, plenty of options with the buffet. Breakfast consisted of every kind of meat, pancakes, fresh donuts, fruit, crepes, and omelets made to order. The buffet for lunch and dinner was wonderful as well, pizza, pasta, meats, fresh steamed veggies and much much more. The beach restaurant had a buffet during the day with hot dogs, burgers (not so good), and salad. For dinner they had the place divided into 2, 1 side was the steak house and the other side was seafood. We only went to the steak house twice, it was fabulous. We also made reservations for the gourmet (wonderful) and the Japanese (fabulous and entertaining), I would suggest as one of you check in the other go the the desk to make reservations for these two places and some people did not get in. There were 2 other restaurants, the Caribbean and a Chinese which we did not go to but heard from others that is was good. You do have to wear long pants to get into the Gourmet restaurant, Japanese, Chinese and Caribbean restaurants. The beach was fabulous and plenty of chairs to go around. We only found one day that is was limited. There were plenty of activities around the pool bar during the day but would say if you are a younger couple looking for lots of entertainment than you should probably stay down the beach near the Bavaros up by the Majestic it is very quiet. A great place to relax or bring kids so they can enjoy the fabulous pool and not see things that they shouldn't. Don't get me wrong, there are topless women sunbathing. The rooms were very clean floors washed daily and beds changed daily, we would leave the maid 2 dollars a day. The shops at the resort did not have a lot of souvenirs as far as t-shirts and things to bring home for kids. We did walk to a place right outside the resort gate (very safe) called the hole in the wall. You really don't need to that because on Thursday night all the vendors come into the resort and set up tables and you can barter with them. We never made it to the disco so We cannot comment. We went to the Casino every night and a great time. I am not very good at Roulette. The resort itself was very well laid out and everything was very clean. The staff was great to deal with and tried very hard to understand, we never had any issues. We did two tours, the Bavarro Runners tour, which was just ok. We also did the Marinarium tour, which was a blast. The bus picked us up at the hotel and took us to the beach down by the Bavaro hotels about 15 minutes away, we got onto a Catamaran and went not far off shore and got to snorkel and swim with nurse sharks and stingrays. What a great experience. After that they took us down the beach to a natural sand bar and we all got off and they served us drinks in the water. After that we headed back to the beach. On the way back they were served drinks, we had dancing lessons and they showed us how to make a coco loco. The tours were not that expensive about $80.00 each per person. All in all it was a fabulous vacation and would recommend it to everyone. Feel free to email me with any questions. Not only was I viewing this as a guest but as a travel agent.

<Content>Fantastic Experience We went to the Majestic Colonial from the 23rd of April to the 30th, all in all it was a great time, the animators (entertainment staff) were so very friendly and always helpful.The food overall was great from breakfast to supper including buffet and a la carte.Make sure to make reservations at arrival, also make sure to save pool and beach chairs by 07:00 or 08:00 in the morning if you want a shaded area.The entertainment on the beach was fabulous all of the animators, Ricky Aaaa, Johnny, Jose and Co., always had a Super Crazy Game for everyone to play, along with some crazy music that set up the mood. At the swim up bar look for Alberto and Renato they are superb bartenders. The room was spacious especially the shower, and always kept clean.Mini bar always replenished, with a lot of water, soda (pop) and (Presidente) beer, we always tipped not only the maids and our mini bar restocker, but the waiters and bartenders, who were always more than grateful and helpful, they do work very hard . One day our minibar was not replenished so we called room service,It was immediately taken care of and a courtesy call was made shortly after to us, making sure the matter was resolved. As far as any negative reviews that we have read , they obviously don't appreciate a great destination or don't know how to have a good time.

<Content>2 thumbs up across the board! After seven trips to Punta Cana, I guess we can be considered seasoned travellers, at least where the east coast of the Dominican Republic is concerned. Our vacation goals are simple: we want to relax, enjoy some good food and drink, and get a great tan. Our goals were met and exceeded at this 5 star resort. I emailed the hotel through their website (http://www.majesticcolonial.com) a few weeks prior to our trip to request a second floor or higher room that was close to the beach, and that was exactly what we got (our travel agent included a similar request when we booked). We were in room 4222 on the second floor. We faced a treed lot, but we actually had a pretty good view of the ocean from the balcony. We were about a minute from the beach and a few minutes walk from the front of the resort where the buffet and theatre are located. Our room was exactly as pictured on their website 鈥?soaker tub, 4 poster king-sized bed, etc. We had no problems with the bathroom/toilet set-up, but then, it was just the two of us. The bathrooms don鈥檛 seem to have been designed with families in mind 鈥?those with very small children would probably be okay, but families rooming with teenagers or older kids might find things a little awkward. The king sized bed was very comfortable, though the pillows were quite flat. Fortunately the hotel provides extras in the closet so the pillow situation was easily remedied. The closet afforded plenty of storage space and lots of hangers. The safe (keyless entry/programmable) was also stored in one of the closets. Our mini bar was refilled on a daily basis, and when we left a US dollar with a note for more beer and water (鈥渕as cervesas y agua, por favor鈥?, our request was met (not leaving the note and money resulted in the standard refill of 2 bottles each of Presidente and Pepsi, one bottle each of orange pop and diet Pepsi, and a few bottles of water). The oversized shower with 2 showerheads was awesome 鈥?we never had any problems with water pressure or with shortages of hot water, though the shower was quite slow to drain. I was very impressed with the grounds and landscaping, considering how new the resort is. I expected tiny palm trees and barely-there foliage; what I found were towering, mature trees and bushes in full bloom. In another year or so the grounds will be truly spectacular. Our tour rep told us that the resort was designed to encourage people to spread out, hence the sprawling pool that runs the length of the resort. The idea certainly worked 鈥?we were surprised to learn that the resort was at 100% capacity during our stay. The resort didn鈥檛 seem busy or crowded at all, and best of all, we never had to get up early to reserve chairs. We saw empty palapas at the pool as late as 10:30 a.m. The beach may have been a different story; we spent our mornings at the pool and most afternoons on the beach.I was thrilled with the quality and selection of food in the a la cartes and the main buffet restaurant. Hot foods were hot and cold foods were cold, and serving platters never sat empty for more than a minute before being refilled. Tables were cleared promptly and I don鈥檛 think I ever actually finished a drink in a restaurant because someone was always right there to top you up or get you a refill. We had breakfast each morning in the buffet restaurant. They offered the usual bacon, sausages, fruits, juices and pancakes, along with made to order crepes and omelettes. The omelettes were awesome and were cooked just right each morning. Be sure to grab a slice of the delicious banana bread, too; it disappears pretty quickly. A continental breakfast was offered at the beachfront restaurant after 10 a.m. so if you wanted to sleep in a bit, you weren鈥檛 out of luck for your morning meal. The lunch buffet was open from 12:30-3 p.m and offered an impressive spread of everything from French fries to ham carved off the bone. I鈥檓 not a big fan of pasta, but the made to order pasta station was awesome 鈥?I think I ate more pasta in one week than I have in a year. Reservations are required for the French/gourmet restaurant and the Japanese 鈥?the Caribbean, Chinese, Steakhouse and Seafood were all first come, first serve. We dined at all but the French (we had a reservation but cancelled it in favour of the steakhouse that night) and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. Make your a la carte reservatiosn as soon as you arrive at the hotel - before you go to your room, even! The reservation desk is directly across from the check-in counter, just outside of the clothing store on the upper level. Take whatever time they offer you for the Japanese restaurant 鈥?the resort holds 1300 people but can only accommodate 260 per week in the Japanese restaurant. The food presentation and atmosphere was incredible, and the portions were almost too big. The Chinese restaurant, located just outside the Japanese, had fantastic sushi 鈥?we popped in twice just for appetizers. The seafood restaurant was great but the portions were rather small (easily remedied by a visit to the buffet afterwards for more food or for dessert). We dined at the steakhouse twice and it was delicious both times 鈥?the chateaubriand was to die for. There is some confusion as to what is and is not included in the AI portion at this hotel. Room service is available but not included. After coming home I also learned that in-room, high-speed Internet is included but you鈥檒l pay a $10 US deposit if you don鈥檛 have the appropriate cables/hookups with you. Some premium/top shelf drinks carry an extra fee, though I was pleasantly surprised at the number of brand name liquors that were included in the AI. My better half enjoyed Johnny Walker Red Label with coke all week, and I saw Smirnoff and Jim Beam being poured frequently as well. If you wanted Johnny Walker Black Label or Canadian Club in your drink, that would cost you an extra $9 US, but really, if you鈥檙e going to mix it, why pay extra? House wines were included at all restaurants (the white was okay, the red tasted like homemade wine that needs a few more months to mature) and imported wines were available for purchase, too. Bavaro beach never disappoints in terms of beauty, and this section of beach was no exception ~ the sand was clean of sea debris and the water was crystal clear. There were some rocky patches in the swimming area, but the left side of the roped off section was much clearer with no rocks or sea grass. Snorkelling was quite good on this section of beach 鈥?we borrowed our friend鈥檚 goggles and were amazed at the variety of fish swimming beneath us. At the water sports hut on the beach, guests can borrow catamarans, kayaks, boogie boards, and windsurfing and snorkelling equipment; I believe each guest is allowed 1 hour per day to use such equipment. The pool is enormous and offered plenty of spots to just relax or get in on the fun offered by the Animation team. The section between the front lobby and the spa was typically quieter, while the area from the spa to the beach was more active and loud (this is where all the Animation activities took place). There is a huge warm pool with fountains and waterfalls just off the main pool behind the spa 鈥?this was a wonderful place to unwind at the end of the day (though we found that children tended to congregate in this pool since it was so warm). Saunas were also available in this area, along with cold and hot water Jacuzzi pools. The Majestic offers plenty of things to keep you entertained, whether you participate or are just a spectator. Aerobics and stretching were offered each morning on the beach, as well as soccer, volleyball as well as the typical silly games like coconut bowling and egg tossing contests. Water polo and aerobics took place in the pool, and things like arm wrestling contests, bingo, and Spanish lessons were offered poolside (made all the more amusing with generous doses of alcohol). Evening entertainment took place in the theatre and was your typical AI fare of audience participation shows and dance performances. The only show we attended was the Michael Jackson revue, which was quite well done. I didn鈥檛 enjoy the music so much but the dancing and special effects were impressive, particularly for Thriller. The resort offered a children鈥檚 movie early each evening in the theatre followed by a brief kids show on the stage. Friends told us that the daytime kids club was very good as well. Internet services were available off the main shopping street (hang a left after the medical centre) at a charge of $5 US per hour. We did not use the internet centre but were advised of the pricing by our tour rep. Of all the places we have stayed in Punta Cana, $5/hr is the cheapest I have ever heard of - much cheaper than phoning home just to say you've arrived and are having fun. The resort offers an air conditioned gym which I鈥檓 told is equipped with new, good quality machines 鈥?some treadmills and elliptical trainers, weight machines, free weights, etc. It opens at 7 a.m. each day and there is usually someone there to provide instruction for the machines if you need it. The activities sheet in our room also indicated that 鈥渋mpact walking鈥? light walks, and aerobics were conducted between 7-9 a.m. on a daily basis in the gym. The gym is located just past the shopping area, next to the casino/disco. We did not visit the casino or disco so I can鈥檛 comment much on that, though from the outside, the casino didn鈥檛 look very big. I hear the disco was quite the happening place to be later in the evening 鈥?unfortunately for us, those long days in the sun had us ready to turn in early most nights. The only 鈥渆xcursion鈥?we took part in was an outing to the local cigar manufacturer, Don Lucas cigars. This trip was completely free of charge 鈥?my kind of excursion! Our tour rep arranged our transportation, though the front desk of the hotel could probably also make the arrangements for you. The 鈥渇actory鈥?(it鈥檚 a very small setup) was probably 15 minutes from the resort, but because it was a busy traffic time when we went (around lunch time), it took us closer to 30 minutes to get there. After a brief demonstration of how the cigars are made, we went into the main shop where they also sell jewellery, artwork, coffee and alcohol. Anyone who was interested could sample a cigar, free of charge. We spent $82 at the shop; 4 packages of coffee cost us $20 US, a 700 mL bottle of Brugal Extra Viejo rum was $12 and Brandon got 4 cigars for $50/$12.50 a piece. They did have some Cohibas and other imports for sale, but they were not willing to barter on the prices so most people just picked up a few of the better Dominican brands. Dominican cigars on the resort were selling for $35 apiece, so I think the boys got a good deal on their smokes. One tip for the ladies (and probably for the men, too) 鈥?use the facilities at the hotel before venturing out on this trip. To put it nicely, the washrooms here were nowhere near as clean as at the hotel - if you have to go, do it before you leave or wait till you get back (I learned this the hard way). Shopping on the resort was typical of most AI hotels in the DR; prices were high and the shopkeepers didn鈥檛 have much wiggle room to bargain. I purchased a printed bandana type scarf to cover my hair for $7 US in one shop 鈥?I like to shop in peace so I didn鈥檛 mind paying that price (and I鈥檇 sunburnt my scalp so I was a little desperate). The store right on the end of the resort鈥檚 shopping street is the mini-market where you could purchase snacks, alcohol, post cards, and toiletries. I appreciated that the prices were marked in US dollars instead of pesos. A can of Pringles was $5, a 700 mL bottle of Brugal rum was $15.50, and coffee was $10. If you like to haggle and want more selection, there is a small strip mall type plaza near the hotel 鈥?I believe it is called Plaza Blanco. The fastest way to get there was to walk about 10 minutes from the front entrance of the hotel, then pass through the hole in the barrier wall (it鈥檚 marked with a sign indicating a shopping centre). Our friends picked up some t-shirts there for $5 a piece and Hawaiian-style shirts for $10 US a piece. We were told to pay between 20-40% of the vendor鈥檚 original asking price, but our friends also told us that some of the vendors really did not want to haggle on prices. Be prepared to walk away if you don鈥檛 feel you鈥檙e getting a good deal. Beach vendors were also located about an hour鈥檚 walk south of the resort toward the Gran Bahia and RIUs. We never ventured that far down the beach so I can鈥檛 comment on the shopping there. I have to say that the service at the Majestic was just fantastic. We had very few problems/complaints but those that we did bring to their attention, such as our balcony door not locking right, were fixed within one hour. All of the staff that we encountered, from groundskeepers to the general manager, Jorge, whom I had the pleasure of meeting one evening, were very friendly and seemed intent on ensuring that we had a good experience at their hotel. I was very impressed to learn from our tour rep that the Majestic is one of the few hotels in the region that offers daily lessons in English and hospitality training for their employees. I would often ask a question in (my very limited) Spanish and receive an answer in English 鈥?the staff seemed to be working hard to make use of their schooling! In almost all cases, service in the restaurants and bars was always fast and provided with a smile. The staff worked hard to keep their respective areas in tip-top condition; I was especially impressed with how clean all of the washrooms were, especially those near the pool and beach. I should also note here that the resort seemed very wheelchair friendly. There were elevators in the front lobby area to take you from the main check-in level to the lower level which accessed the rest of the resort. Each block of rooms also had at least one elevator that serviced all floors. I noticed many wheelchair accessable ramps throughout the resort as well, and walkways were tiled in a flat enough manner that getting around on wheels does not seem like it would have been an inconvenient journey.A word on staying healthy: please remember to pack your common sense when visiting anywhere in the Caribbean. Guests rarely get sick from the food in the Dominican Republic. More often, they become ill because they try to consume everything in sight during their first 2 days of vacation. Add to this 8-10 hours a day in the scorching sun, often without adequate sunblock, and almost always without sufficient hydration and yes, you鈥檙e going to get sick. The buffet and the bar will be there tomorrow 鈥?you don鈥檛 have to try everything on your first day. The sun will also be there tomorrow, so apply that sunscreen with a generous hand and you鈥檒l have a much more enjoyable vacation. Toss in a bottle of water after every couple of drinks and you鈥檙e good to go. I ate everything that appealed to me at the restaurants, including salads twice a day, and probably drank my weight in a variety of alcoholic drinks, and never experienced any form of sickness (neither of us needed even a single dose of Immodium all week 鈥?that鈥檚 a first). We were also careful to apply SPF 30 every 2-3 hours, and were sure to chug a bottle of water after every couple of alcoholic drinks. Your holiday is what you make of it 鈥?if you play it smart, you鈥檒l stay healthy and enjoy yourself a whole lot more!To sum up, we were thrilled with the Majestic Colonial and highly recommend it for anyone wanting a top-notch vacation in Punta Cana. If anyone has questions or would like to see photos of the hotel, you鈥檙e welcome to contact me via email at ginnyfyris@yahoo.ca Happy travels!

<Content>We thoroughly enjoyed every minute! Absolute Magic!From the welcome drink we received as we were checking in, until the second we checked out we loved it.Everyone has commented on the rooms, so all I will say about them is that they are beautiful. Spacious and comfortable and immaculate! We had room #2233 and it was situated perfectly, we could sit on the patio and watch the activities at the swim up bar and had great pool access and could see the ocean also! We tipped our maid daily and had made up little gift bags for her everyday and she made us towel art with fresh flowers everyday and kept the room in perfect condition.The water boy as I called him could have been better. He only left a few waters and 2 presidentes in our mini bar everyday even though we tipped him and he didn't leave any champagne at all for the whole week.The food was typical caribbean at the buffets, but there was so much to choose from you could always find something good. We loved the gourmet, the japanese and the caribbean restaurants! I would recommend eating at them as they were the best!! We didn't get a cooking table at the japanese, but you can just walk in and have a regular table as often as you want and the chicken chow mein was wonderful!The pool was phenomenal, the beach and water was gorgeous. The weather was as near to perfect as could be!The staff was constantly cleaning and extremely friendly. We tipped absolutely everyone and they were very appreciative.We only went to the Michael Jackson show but it was superb in our opinion, the entertainment staff are wonderful and very talented.The casino is very small, but we had a good time and left lots of our money there! :)We can't say enough good about this resort. We had an absolutely perfect vacation, we stayed for 7 nights and the only thing we would have changed was to stay longer!!!!!

<Content>Relaxing week at the Majestic My husband and I stayed at the majestic April 17-24. This is the 5th all-inclusive we have visited, and our second time to Punta Cana. Overall, we were pleased with the resort and would recommend it to anyone going to PC. For the specifics:The Beach-Very nice. Beautiful clear water, pretty decent snorkeling right off the beach. Even on days when the weather was less than perfect and the waves were a little stronger it still seemed safe to swim. On better weather days the water was pretty calm. Just be careful venturing outside of the roped off areas as boats occasionally buzzed by kind of close. Beach area in front of the resort was kept clean, and there were lots of palaps for shade although you had to reserve one early in the day or come back later in the afternoon.The Pool-As most have said, it was very large, beautiful and clean. Probably my second favorite pool of all the resorts we have been to. It had a large swim up bar. Service there could be a little slow, but we gave a two dollar tip one day and our drinks never reached empty the rest of the day without being refilled.The Room-Rooms were a good size, with a sleeper sofa and desk on one side and bed on the other. Minibar had soda, water and 2 beers, and was restocked every day. We tipped and asked for more beer in the fridge since there were only two small bottles, and they brought 2 more. Fridge wasn't extremely cold but that wasn't a problem since they provided an ice bucket and had ice machines close to the rooms. A bottle of champagne and a small bottle of rum were also in the room the first day. (Also included) Others have covered the bathroom situation, so you already know how that goes. The room was kept clean and we did not have any bugs of any kind in our room during our stay. The room we were originally assigned was a first floor Majestic Suite with the jacuzzi outside. The outside jacuzzi was the same size as the inside one, and you were only steps away from the pool so everyone could watch you relax in your outside jacuzzi. I told our vacation rep I was not happy with this since I had told my travel agent I wanted anything BUT the first floor, and the front desk staff worked with us and put us in a great ocean front second floor room instead. We saw almost no bugs at the resort in general, but did see a lot of little worms that looked like small centipedes on the first floor. The a/c in the rooms was set not to go below 19 degrees centigrade, and I found that a little uncomfortable for sleeping, but no big deal. They do offer room service, but it costs extra and was pretty pricey (a hot dog was $8, a hamburger was $10-it got worse from there).The Resort Layout-This was a mid-sized resort compared to others we had been to, and we had no trouble getting around. Our room was at the opposite end of the resort from the lobby and most of the restaraunts, but the walk was not bad at all. They also had several elevators in the hallways and two in the lobby, so getting around did not seem to be bad for people who have problems with stairs. Walkways from the rooms to the main lobby and most of the restaurants were covered, which came in handy when it rained.Food-As others have mentioned, you shouldn't expect fabulous food every day at any AI. The food here was good. I liked it better than my husband, but there was a lot to choose from and we liked that you only had to make reservations for two of the ala cartes. We were able to get reservations at both the Japanese and Gourmet. I liked the Japanese, and the Gourmet was o.k. I ordered the filet there and am not quite sure what I got, but it wasn't a filet. Still it was a decent steak. The seafood and steak house are the same place divided in half at night. We ate at the steakhouse part one night and received the slowest service of any place at the resort, but the food was pretty good. We went to the seafood side a few nights later and received the best service of our stay, so you can never tell how it will go. My husband had the lobster and said it was very good. We are pretty brave and tried just about everything from goat to octopus pizza, and neither of us got sick while we were there, which is rare for me because I have some stomach issues anyway. The breakfast buffet was really good, and the self-serve mimosas were a good way to start the day!Casino-The casino was small, but had several slot machines, a roulette table, blackjack and poker. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, and we saw a woman win over $500 on a nickle slot machine one night. Drinks were included at the casino.Service-Overall the service was better than I expected here. We had been to the DR 5 years ago and found the staff at the last resort slightly unfriendly and the service was very slow. I went expecting this again, so I was pleasantly surprised. Every request we made was granted, from changing rooms to extra pillows to extra beer for the fridge. There were some problems with the language barrier, but we were patient and they were patient and we eventually always ended up getting what we needed. Some problems that people had earlier in the year have been resolved. There is now a daily schedule of events at the front of the resort outside of the lobby bar, so you know what will be going on that day and what the show will be that night. They also gave everyone a booklet with a map that listed the restaurants and their hours when we checked in so we knew where everything was from the start.Shopping-There were a few small shops at the resort and they are making a few more. They brought vendors in to the resort to set up booths on Thursday night so there was more to choose from but you had to do the ever popular haggling. We visited the shopping plaza outside and to the right of the front entrance of the resort, (through the hole in the wall and were able to buy things cheaper there than at the resort. I only gave the Majestic 4 out of five stars because I feel that to be a five star room service should be included, and you should be able to adjust the a/c to a comfortable temperature, not one they have set for you since everybody is different. The other thing the resort is lacking is service at the beach and poolside. While I don't mind to get up and get myself a drink, others did seem to mind. It was a little bit of a hike to get from the beach to the closest bar. Empty drink cups sometimes sat around the pool for too long since there was no service around the pool and not many trash cans (we threw ours away, but some people are really lazy you know),and some of them ended up in the pool a few times. (This did not happen very often, don't get the idea that the pool was dirty). None of these things is the end of the world, just small improvements that could be made to elevate the resort to 5 star status in my opinion. I would recommend this resort to anyone who wants to go and relax and enjoy the great pool, beautiful beach and friendly staff.If anyone has any questions, feel free to e-mail and ask and I will be happy to try to help. If you have already booked a vacation at this resort, relax-you will have a great time!

<Content>Love the pool My husband and 2 kids ( ages 12 and 1) stayed during the 16 to 22 April and we had a really good time. I will not go into details of the room as everyone has except that if you have kids take the direct pool access. If you have teenagers you may want to request the direct pool access but request a room that is close to the activities at the end of the resort closer to the beach. The rooms are huge we had a king size bed, a cot and a crib with lots of space to spare. These rooms come with a jacuzzi on the porch and for us with kids of such different ages it worked out perfect. The little one treated it as her own little pool and we could watch the older one from the porch in the large pool which is NEVER crowded because of the size. We could always get space at the beach as well.The great thing about Majestic and we have stayed in quite a few all inclusives across the Caribbean is the variety of food and activities . There is something for all ages. There is live music for the older crowd in the evening with cocktails, there is a good disney movie at 7.00 everynight (Lion King , Nemo etc) and then the live shows from 10.00 which were good and very professional. I mean you can't expect vegas in an all inclusive resort. The staff was very helpful, everyday, we did not have any probs with the language . The buffet has a wide variety . The food was good for an all inclusive( the meats are not the best) The speciality restaurant we could not get in the Japanese ( so book the day you arrive ) and book the Gourmet it was very good. The deserts at the buffet is good every day, surprisingly the chocolate cake was absolutely divine.  If you want to get your hair braided DO NOT use the hotel, 10feet away are locals that charge a third of the cost. Arriving in the airport is a breeze but leaving is a hassle so get there with enough time if you are travelling AA.....I would definitely recommend this to anyone with kids especially around the age 1- 10 .The kids club appeared to be good. Young teenagers might be bored. We don't like to go to any resort twice but prefer to try out different locations BUT because of all the convenience of this resort , we will probably go again...... Ohh the ambience is fabulous !!!  Additionally we got stranded one night( due to AA) and were put up at the Punta Cana beach Resort . This is a big resort but clearly way below the standard of Majestic. The buffet dinner had one quarter of that at the Majestic and not as tasty. In terms of extra activities - Manatee Park well the one year old enjoyed it but it really is nothing big. Do not buy the chicken wings there ( it is the nastiest thing you would taste) everything is also over priced. All and all , this resort is definitely worth the price!!!!! There is really not one thing that you can complain about!

<Content>Loved the Majestic My husband and I just got back from staying at the Majestic in Punta Cana. I have read many reviews on this site that said the food was horrible, etc... The food was great. If you have ever been out of the country before, you know not to expect much at an international all inclusive resort. If you go, try the steak house. It was far the best. The only bad thing about the resort are the drinks. I am a beer and wine drinker and I did not like any of the wine or any of the beer. If you are a wine lover, I suggest you bring your own wine from home to take out to dinner. We did that and so did some other people. The resort itself is really beautiful. Everything in the bathrooms are marble. We also had a jacuzzi tub in our room and also had a jacuzzi on the porch outside our room. Most of the staff were very friendly. The pool is awesome. They also had champagne all over the place. My overall stay was GREAT!

<Content>4 star hotel, some 1 star guests Went with 2 adults and our 3 children ages 9-13 and we had a great time. The weather was great ( a lttle rain here and there) but overall, great weather so that helped. To reply to earlier comments:Staff -- friendly and helpful. I never would have retrieved my lost luggage from the airport without the help of guest services who put through many many calls on my behalf. People don't speak English???? I tried to speak spanish, but no one would let me. The only spanish I spoke was to spanish speaking guests. One complaint was that staff tried so hard to be nice, that they really didn't enforce any rules with rude guests.Rooms -- Clean. Definitely damp-- particularly if you don't keep the AC on at all times. (Once the maid turned it off and all of our clothes for the evening felt wet) One of our rooms had the musty beach smell, and the other had it intermittently. I wish they could find a good dehumidifier solution to the problem!We had a different maid every day it seemed, but never had towel art, though I saw it in many other rooms. But the rooms were cleaned and we always had enough supplies-- towels, soap, water (which is brought by another person, not the maid, and it is generally brought much later in the day). Never, never saw a misquito during the entire trip, though there was a bee in my room on the last day. They spray nearly every night and cut the foliage beside the hotel to curtail insects. We did get bites, but only on our feet, so we suspect it was sand fleas or something. Because of the way the rooms were set up, we didn't really have a big problem with the open bathroom configuration. Some rooms may be set up differently, so maybe it does make a difference in them. I wasn't happy initially about the open toilet set up, but it turned out to be a much better solution, providing for better ventilation. The WC itself was no smaller than many I've seen in Europe, the advantage to this one being the ventilation.OH! and be careful when you put your belongings in the closets. In some rooms, the last closet contains an electrical panel which the workmen open from outside the room and never seem to close up again. Came home more than once to find my daughter's closet open to the hallway with all of her clothing exposed. Beach -- gorgeous. Found exactly three large shards of glass, all under trees which the perpetrators obviously had to use to break their beer bottles. Otherwise, very very clean, though I did get odd pieces of coral, palm slivers and shells in my feet. Be there by 7 to get a chair, or give up until after two. We sat near the volleybal court and found the exercise and game gurus to be great fun. Lots of topless women, so if that bothers you, stick with the pool.Pool -- beautiful. Yes, there is a problem with the concrete. Not sure how they will deal with this. they'll have to close it down for a while to fix it. Food -- we loved it. The fruit was absolutely amazing. Never ate so much in my life. We all got sick one morning after going to the Carribean restaurant. The food there was so good, that we all shared everything on our plates, making it difficult to isolate the problem. But we soon rallied, so no big deal. Got reservations easily at the Gourmet restaurant b/c there were only 2 of us going. We were told NO children of any age allowed. however, when we got there, they told us 12 and up OK. then we ended up sitting between a table with a 7 year old and a table with a young couple wearing ripped jeans and logoed t-shirts. So much for the enforced ambiance.Maintenance and Grounds -- people were working, cleaning, mopping, repairing constantly. It certainly never interfered with my enjoyment and all the cleaning gave me a good feeling about the upkeep.Complaints -- Some of the guests. To give you a sampling, there was the man who decided he didn't like his drink at the swim up bar, so he threw the slushy drink, garnish and all, into the pool. There were the parents who brought their baby to the pool undiapered--with the expected consequences. Then some one stepped in it . . . Ugh! (Maybe the stomach problems are NOT brought on by the food, huh?) There were the parents who looked on admiringly while their children poked the parrots at the pool bar with sticks. (bartender bit her lip and said nothing), the parents who gave their toddler a glass beer bottle to play with in the pool, the child who vomited in the restaurant bathroom, but whose mother brought him back to the buffet to select his food within minutes of the episode (no, she didn't report it to the staff so they could clean up, I did). There were the people who took full advantage of the lack of dress code in the dining room by showing up at dinner wearing cut off sweat pants and muscle shirts. You get the picture. This was the only real downside to our vacation.Would definitely go back -- like tomorrow!

<Content>It could have been better! We did not enjoy the majestic. Our room the minute you walked in reaked of mold though it is only 7 months old. They only give you 2 towels and though I called several times to ask for more did not get any. They give you 'cards' to get your towels, but only 1 towel stand is open though their map tells you there should be more (no one was working those). The food was awful and the drinks worse. They were limited to presidente beer and what was pre-made. Name brand liquor was a charge - not included. Do not get hungry when the restaurants are not open since that too will be a charge. The to do items that were supposedly included - the wind surfer, small boats, cataman, etc - were reserved until the day after we left according the staff there, though we never saw anyone using them. Even we asked again, since they were just sitting there we were told 'no, they are reserved.' The pool and beach were nice.

<Content>Perfect I wouldnt pay much attention to the little details, you are in the Carribean! We got a great deal here for 3 nights and we loved it. My fiance and I actually got engaged on this very property! We are both 25 from the US. If you can't find a single thing to eat at this resort then you are crazy. The buffets and restaurants are all very good, although the service may be lacking. Thats one thing to understand, Dominicans tend to move slower and take it easier, which is no big deal, you just need to understand that. The diversity of the crowd is fun too, lots of europeans and canadians, who were all very nice and fun to chat with.The housekeeping and rooms were spectacular, we loved the room, although we were rarely in it.Overall, I would recommend this place highly.

<Content>Ola! Wish we were still there We (me, my husband, two 13year olds, and a three year old)just returned from 5 nights April 8-13th. I was extremely worried based on the mixed reveiws here. So, if you are worried...don't be. Just go and have fun. The majestic has all the elements to do so. One thing I learned is that two people can have very different experiences and even if they were identical, people will still veiw things differently!...i will give some of my opinions...But to sum it up...Beautiful place and rooms, gorgeous beach and pool! Three of the most important elements to a great vacation.Rooms are all nice, but veiws will vary. We had a pool veiw third floor building 3. 3323 and 3324. We tried for an ocean veiw but with no luck as they were filled to capacity. The pool veiw was actually an upgrade from the garden veiw which we payed for. Veiw was very nice. If you have specific room questions e-mail me. There are definate beter rooms and a method to the numbering system. We had a few minor problems in the room, but nothing major(drainage issue, leak after heavy rain). I do agree that the rooms will continue to deteriorate, due to shabby construction, but for now are still very pretty.Food...average at best. If you are a real foodie(we are from NY) you might not be pleased, if it is an important element to your vacation. For us, this time around, it was not the most important thing. We wanted an all inclusive, no worries with the kids. Our experience was that the dinner and lunch buffets should be had early. They are better and fresher. Breakfast buffet is the best meal there. Much to choose from. Fresh omlettes made to order, Fresh smoked salmon, fresh crepes, donuts, fruit..all good. Load up! You won't need lunch! Resturants...Best in my opinion was the chateau briand at the steakhouse. Fahitas at the carribean resturant, and the chinese resturant (otherside of japanese) was surprisingly good. I had the schechuan beef, fried rice, chicken chowmain, wonton soup, all very good. Japaneese, we waited all vacation and even got a sitter for the little one! And we were very disapointed. However, I think the experience varies greatly based on your chef. Ours was boring, no tricks, no fires, nothing!...Like watching your mom cook! LOL...But the night before, while we were in the chinese portion..we heard cheers coming from the other side! Basically we heard that the food at this resort is the best out of the all inclusives at Punta Cana....So don't change resorts based on the food...change the destination!Drinks...not the place if you like martinis, and good bottles of wine...However, you can always find something to drink...my best discovery was that the lobby bar downstairs makes great mohitos!! And my husband was hppy with el presidente beer.Entertainment. What we saw...Micheal Jackson, was fun. My husband hit the casino one night(lost) but had fun, and we hit the disco one night. Also fun. I think they could use some work on activities for teens, but maggie at the kids club was really good with our three year old, and she also will baby sit in the evening for 15.00 per hour.Thanks Maggie!..This is not a total family destination, there are probably better resorts for that...But they were kept busy at the beach and pool, so was not really a problem.All and all I wish we stayed longer. Takes a bit just to get adjusted, and figure out what you like and don't like. Oh yea, and even when they are full, it never really feels full. No crowds, anywhere...Only thing is people must wake the crack of dawn to reserve the huts at the beach. But I just looked for one that was being held with a mear plastic bag (no towels or personal effects, weak attempt) and snagged it. We never had anyone approach us!My husband did get the runs and felt pretty sick one night...but who knows, we all had a little bit of a bug before we even got there, so can't really blame it on the resort. We were told though, to stay away from too many pina coladas as the coconut creme is like a laxative!Lastly the snorkling, kyacking, and tubing for free at the resort are nice. Hourseback riding on the beach was very nice. half day trip to the marinatarium: snorkling, and then swiming with sharks and stingrays was fun for the teens... Too much time on the bus though...snorkling part was just o.k if you have been to other places like the Caymens or cozamel.People were nice, there is a language barrier (so what), tipping is appreciated but not necessary. Try to speak spanish, they appreciate that!Anyway... I know I have written alot, just felt like I had to, since I did so much reading of other reveiws. I am more than happy to answer any questions..But just go and have fun..The resort and beach are georgous..Nicest carribean beach i have ever been to and I have been to many! Ola!

<Content>Always have a great vacation! We always have a great time on vacation - we have that mindset b/c we pay too much money to go to complain and find fault. We were at majestic from March 20 to April 3. After reading every review since the place opened, I have finally decided to write a review - my first. In short, Majestic was beautiful, but way missing some little things and in time may get it all together. The rooms, grounds, common areas, beach, pool, were absolutely gorgeous - but it is evident things were rushed to open in time and the resort will probably have some maintenance problems in a short time! From reading the recent reviews, it seems everyone had the same problem we had with the leaking toilet stall on rainy nights. Someone didn't finish the vents properly, and now they are all leaking. We put our umbrella over the crapper and left it there for the housekeeping staff - next time it rained we did not leak!!Shopping - many people have mentioned the flea market down the beach, but there is also one - about 30 shops- just outside the Majestic gates. Just follow the road you came in on (off reception area)to the gate - 5 to 10 minute walk - lots to choose from and good bargaining.Food- we always enjoyed breakfast at the buffet but only had one lunch and one dinner there. Found the food about the same as any buffet - we are not real buffet fans - brakfast was great when you got it grilled to order - omellets, eggs anyway, crepes and pancakes. We mostly ate at the a la carte restaurants - the Chinese 4 times - it was great food and great service and you didn't need reservations. A lot of people we talked to did not know it was even there. It was in the same door as the Japanese, in the outer area. We also loved the French restaurant - le Gourmet. If you go and see Danny - the head waiter - tell him the lobsterfisherman from Canada says hello! They treated us like royalty with special soup and special dessert that were not on the menu . And I will say that we are not big tippers - a couple dollars left on the table after a nice meal - and our pockets full of candy for any of the staff that waited on us. The Dominicians are wonderful, friendly, hardwarking people. We went to the Mexican 2 nights - also no reservations required - it was OK, but we are not Mexican food fans - I had the fajitas and found them good except too salty. We went to the steak house once and had blood red chateaubrian after ordering medium well, so didn't go back - it was also very busy that night and the service wasn't great although the head waiter was actually timing the orders from when taken to delivered, but he seemed very tense with the wait staff and the atmosphere was not as relaxed as you like on vacation. I found myself feeling sorry for the people working under his thumb. Did not try the seafood as lobster is something we have at home and the Dominician lobster is nothing like our Bay of Fundy lobster. Went to the japanese once and really enjoyed the experience of eating at close proximity to 8 other people and getting to know them while the chef did his thing right in front on you. The food was OK but enjoyed the Chinese much better. Anyway as you can see, we did a lot of eating. Make coffe in your room, it is wicked in the buffet - poured thick like molasses! I always stay away from drinks with coconut milk to avoid Carribean revenge! Other than that we ate everything and were never sick.One thing I will comment on that noone seems to have mentioned is the music in the lobby and buffet restaruant! CLASSIC!! on a Caribbean vacation?? I even heard TAPS several times in the restaurant and this terrible TUBA or something in the lobby. Not the right mood for us - maybe they are trying to be upscale to fit with the 5 star rating!! The only time we heard any upbeat music was during the arobics and games on the beach and around the pool.Our first room was 44ll and the elevator did not, does not, and probably will never work. It was 54 steps to our room and our middle age legs grew very sore and tired. After our second day and second inquiry at guest services we were taken to a beautiful room right on the beach, second floor, corner room. If you played volleyball and looked up to the first room you could see, that was us! So stick to your guns if you have a legitimate problem with your room and you will be moved. The rooms had everything you could want, huge shower and tub, lots of hot water and pressure, double sinks - bring your own soap and shampoo and the water is very hard do you need a good quality soap (and facecloths) - mini bar with water, pop, beer everyday, coffee pot, iron, ironing board, good size TV, coach, King bed, patio with 2 chairs and table, lots of storage room and very quiet. We also had extra pillows in our closet but some people had to ask for more. And, oh yes,champagne - we had 2 bottles as we changed rooms. Also champagne in the buffet - have it with orange juice in the morning.I am not going to add to the comments on the beach - that is what has taken us back to the Domincian each year for 3 years. Just gorgeous for miles in both directions. We did need to play the towel game the second week, as it was quite busy, but the first week there was no trouble getting lounges. The Majestic desperately needs a couple of bar huts on the beach. It is a long trek from the bottom of the beach to the top, across the road, up two flights of stairs to the beach restaurant/bar for a thirsty tourist!In summation - Majestic was very good, probably will not go back as there are so many other places to see. Last year we were at Grand Palladium , about 5 miles down the beach, and we would go back there in a heartbeat, but I think it will be Jamacia next year! Got to start reading more reviews! CHOW!Any questions you may e-mail us at peggym@nb.sympatico.ca

<Content>Where's the negative Date: April 17/06Just returned from the Majestic April, 16/06. We booked this vaction in Oct/05 even before the resort opened for a great price. Started reading the reviews as soon as they beacame available thru tripadvisor and thought that we booked a bad vaction spot. Let me tell you if you can put up with a few flies flying around and a small toilet you will have the best vaction ever. We were in paradise once we walked in this beautiful resort, friendliest people you would ever meet and yes they speak english. Food was simply amazing anything you wanted was there, four of us not one problem with stomach. Drinks were great no problem in getting smirnoff vodka at no extra cost. Rooms were big and beds were very comfortable pillows a liitle small but get two. Anamation team was great always around trying to make your vaction the best possible. If you go around and try and find the little things you will find them but the overall experience of this place is simply amazing. Remember your not in Canada and quality of construction is not the same but it is done to the best of their knowledge and it looks great. Believe me you will love this place, don't think twice just book and you will see paradise.

<Content>Space and luxury! Just came back yesterday from a wonderful week at the Majestic.What distinguishes this resort is the sense of space. And space, well, in our days, is luxury...The eye travels far and the view is quite pleasing! The amenities are excellent, the food very good, way better than what I would expect (I'm a Chef...)! and the service is very attentionate. The rooms are big (538 sqft) and very confortable, there is no problem spending any time in it...

<Content>We had a great time but............... My boyfriend and I were at the Majestic March 24 through the 31st. The resort is beautiful. The rooms are great (or at least our room was). We were in room 3347. It was an ocean view with a Jacuzzi on the deck. The deck was huge and had a magnificent view! We had only a couple of problems in our room - one morning the power went out. It was only out for about 30 minutes but the water wasn't working either. The other problem - it was raining in our room. We had a torrential rainstorm one night and I woke up and thought to myself Is it raining in the room? - It was. Right in the bathroom. Needless to say I had been sick earlier that night w/ the majestic revenge and was just happy that I was feeling better or else I would have been sitting in the rain if you catch my drift. They did fix the leak the next morning and we didn't have any problems after that. Our shower did have a problem draining which they tried to fix but never really accomplished that. Taking a shower was more like taking a bath if you were in there for a while. The Jacuzzi in the room and on the deck were both great! We were in those every day - although the Jacuzzi on the deck isn't so private so just be sure you do a quick check before hopping in - my boyfriend caught a glimpse of the guy next door getting into his -oh well! The weather wasn't the greatest the week we were there although we never had a full day of rain. My boyfriend was out on the beach every morning no later than 7:00 securing good real estate. If he didn't do that we would have never been able to sit under the huts and you do need that when the sun gets too hot! The beach was gorgeous and there was always a breeze. The ocean was like bath water and so clear that you could see your feet no matter how deep you were. We never were able to go snorkeling because the seas were too rough (b/c of the bad weather we had) but we saw fish even while we were swimming.Now let's get to the food~ I would have to say if you are a buffet person who really just likes to eat a lot of food and doesn't really care if the quality of food you鈥檙e eating is good than you will be in heaven. We are a not those kind of people. We live in Rhode Island and are spoiled by having some of the best restaurants and the most amazing seafood so our taste buds were not thrilled with basically anything we ate. Everyone raves about the Japanese restaurant and we had reservations our last night there. I was so hungry the whole week from barely being able to eat anything that I was beyond excited to go to the Japanese and have some great food as everyone had said. It was ok. That's all I can say. The gourmet restaurant which is the other one that you need reservations for was no bargain either. We both had the filet and it was literally a Salisbury steak w/ mushroom sauce on top. If you've ever eaten at Capital Grille than you would know what a filet is supposed to taste like. We tried the seafood restaurant and both ordered the lobster - soooooooooo not good. I ended up getting sick that night - not sure if it was the lobster or something else. I would say the best dinner we had was at the Steakhouse - we both had the ch芒teau brigand and it was pretty good. Breakfast was always pretty much good. The donuts are awesome and I ate a lot of those. Wish I could say the drinks were better but I give that a 3 out of 10. The beer is good. My boyfriend drank El Presidente the whole time. I basically stuck to rum  cokes. The frozen drinks have potential to be good but they are just not frozen enough, it's like drinking slush. We found our favorite drink to be at the lobby bar upstairs on the main floor - don't know the name of it but the bartender said it was his special drink - it was the most frozen a drink I got at any bar. We aren't show people so we never saw any of the shows at night. We were in the casino mostly. Make sure if you're a novice at blackjack you are sitting next to someone who can help you b/c most of the dealers don't know how to count and my boyfriend caught them making mistakes several times and taking his money when he had in fact won. I'm a roulette player and I got killed at the tables there. They spin the ball so quickly that you barely have enough time to put your bets down. It was very annoying. I'm also not sure I ever saw any of the dealers crack a smile. That is certainly not fun especially whether you are winning or losing.All in all we had a great time but would probably not ever go back.

<Content>So Amazing My boyfriend and I just got back Fri Apr 7, 2006. We loved The Majestic. The resort was so beautiful. Everything was so clean and new. It was very elegant. All the appliances and electricity functioned properly with never any problems. The jacuzzi tub was awesome. The pool is unbelieveable, so big that it could never be crowded. The service was excellent. The staff is so friendly and hard working. Theres so much food that you never know what to eat. Our favorite was the Japanese restaurant. The buffet is great, theres so many choices that if you cant find something you like, than you have serious issues. The shows at night were good (Michael Jacson was the best). The disco played great music, lots of people dancing and having fun. The beach looks like something you only see in magazines. I have nothing bad to say about this resort, it was amazing

<Content>Excellent Resort ............. Me and my girlfriend just returned from a weeks stay at the Majestic Colonial in Punta Cana .... all in all we had a great time .... The resort is amazing ... pool, beach, rooms. everything exceeded our expecations. For the most part the food was great.... its not home cookin' but I wasnt there for the food and u shouldnt be either ... if u want good food stay home. The japanese restaurant was by far my favourite... got lucky with our reservations but keep in mind that 5 or 10 bucks goes a long way down there. If u cant get in go find the manager and slip him some cash and u will be there within the hour... The steak house and seafood were great as well ... we ate at all the restaurants and if we didnt like them we just left and went to the buffet .... which was great as well ... all the people there were great ... were not in Canada or the US so dont expect perfect english .... other then that all I can say is this resort is definately worth its 5 star rating and ANY negative reviews u have read personally I would just completely ignore them... some people are never satisfied... who can complain when the sun is shining and the beers are cold?... we never had any real problems at all down there so I would definately recommend this place to anyone ... I wish I was still there ..

<Content>Phenominal resort My boyfriend and I got back from the majestic colonial resort in punta cana on april 1st 2006. This resort is outstanding, beautiful and the people are the friendliest people you will ever meet in your entire life. The food in this resort is boundless they have everything you could possibly desire and more!!!! It rained almost everyday but only 1 hour each day the rest of the day would be nice and hot.Here are some tips:1.Make sure you save 20$ american for the end of your trip because you will need it at the airport.2. Bring bug spray(I only got afew bites but the spray is really expensive down there)3. Make sure you visit the market 5mins. away from the resort and BARGAIN, BARGAIN BARGAIN!!!!!4.Make reservations early for the jap and teh french ala carte they are very popular restaurants and always fully booked.5.Bring some pepto.....I didn't get sick but my boyfriend did.6.Tips....the people down there are extremely hard workers so make sure you tip them even 1$ american they are so grateful.7.Ask for more pillows and a map you will need it.8. My last tip is to have a fantastic time and fully enjoy what the resort has to offer.We would deffinitly come to this resort again!!!!

<Content>Great Vacation - Excellent Food, Location  My wife and I have traveled extensively, we are used to dining in quality restaurants both at home and when we travel, and while we usually prefer to stay in normal hotels and eat in restaurants outside the hotel, we have stayed at several all-inclusives in the Playa del Carmen area of Mexico ranging from mid-range to high-end. This was our first trip (March 25-April 1)to an all-inclusive in the Dominican Republic.There have been a lot of reviews posted about the Majestic Colonial, and savvy readers of TripAdvisor reviews should be able to glean something approximating the truth from them. Our experience at the Majestic was pretty much what we expected after reading these reviews. We are really picky, and we loved our stay at this hotel.People who dislike this hotel likely fall into one of two categories: 1)those who may have had some type of unusual problem while there and 2) those who simply cannot be happy. The food at this hotel is excellent - by far the best we have had at an all-inclusive. Piles of smoked salmon every morning at breakfast, locally grown vegetables and fruits that taste 10 times better than the trucked-in ones we can get at home (especially in the winter), and uniformly good seafood, duck, chicken, lamb, goat, and pork (I can't speak to the beef, as I didn't try any) were available at the Majestic. Perhaps those who are unhappy with the food did not try the many inventive preparations available -- highlights for us were the grilled shrimp filet that my wife had in the French restaurant and the Peking Duck that I had in the Asian restaurant (for which you do not need reservations unless you want to see the Japanese show). The local Dominican specialties in the Dominican restaurant (and in the buffet) are also a highlight. Try eating some foods that are outside your normal routine and you will be happy at the Majestic. Best of all, unlike any other all-inclusive we've ever been to, we never had to wait for anything (well, there was a short line for the omelette station at breakfast, but there were 8 types of egg dishes including pre-made omelettes available without waiting). I don't know where the people who complain about this place being crowded are coming from. On our one rainy day during the week, when pretty much everyone at the hotel was at breakfast at the same time, there were empty tables in the buffet restaurant. At night, we never ate in a restaurant that was more than half-full. The tables are so far from one another (compared to tables in a normal restaurant) that we were never bothered by even noisy conversation at the next table. Even at the buffet, staff circulate pouring wine at every meal - there's champaigne at breakfast. Service at the hotel is top-notch. Everyone is super-friendly and helpful. My wife and I both felt the staff was a major plus at this resort. True, not everyone speaks perfect English (or German or Italian or French - as there are many European guests here), but the frontline staff do pretty well with it. Try a little Spanish just for fun.The beach is great. The pool is great. The rooms are beautiful. The jacuzzi tub in the room is deep and comforable for two. The lobby with bars and live music is great. Great news about the bars, too. Apparently the management of the hotel reads these posts. Gordon's gin and Smirnoff vodka are now available at all bars as part of the all-inclusive. The local rum is actually very good, especially the dark one. I also had a nice Spanish brandy every night, again all-inclusive. The drawbacks that keep us from giving this five stars have been mentioned several times in other postings. The mattresses are super-hard. I like firm, but these are killers. The hotel should put some foam padding on them, at the least. The bathrooms give no privacy - I spent some waiting time on the porch due to this, which was actually pleasant. Finally, and I think this is an easily fixable problem, the availability of decent food between the hours of 3:30 and 6:30 p.m. needs to be addressed. We arrived at the hotel very hungry and the only food available was at the beach restaurant. There were hotdogs and hamburgers (which my wife and I do not eat) and a few finger sandwiches with flies all over them (the wind was still that day). I strongly suggest that one of the indoor restaurants stay open all afternoon to accomodate newly arrived guests (as the Dominican stays open all night to accomodate guests arriving in the early hours of the morning). This is a nice hotel. I would go back in a second. There are a few drawbacks, but they are all (with the exception of the bathroom privacy) easily fixed by the hotel management - and I am sure they will be. If you are thinking about going to the Majestic, by all means go. You will have a great vacation.

<Content>Loved it... Just returned on Sunday March 26th after a one week stay with my husband. Thought the resort grounds and rooms were beautiful...and of course the weather was perfect. An ocean breeze kept the beach very comfortable to lay out in the sun without sweating. The water was refreshing.Here's some information I wish I had left home with in regards to the room selection. I had some info, but not quite enough. The 2000 series rooms face the pool, and if you sit out on your balcony in the morning, you will have the sun directly on you. If you prefer an inside room, but would rather have the afternoon sun, then the 3000 series rooms are for you. They are on the opposite side of the grounds and have a more indirect view of the pool, but are still nice. In my opinion, this would be the ideal room to request..... An upper level room (I say upper level because some areas only go to a 3rd level where others go to a 4th). The upper level rooms have vaulted (cathedral) ceilings which make them that much more beautiful. Also ask for an outside or end room closest to the ocean or at least on the ocean side vs. the lobby side. This will provide you not only with a front view from your balcony but a side view as well. Just that much more of a view.We initially were given a 4th floor garden view room. The room was beautiful, but sitting out on the balcony overlooked a wooded lot next door. Not ugly, just nothing to look at.One day my husband and I ventured outside the hotel entrance to the shops. I know you have to negotiate with these vendors as they start with ridiculously high prices. A souvenir spoon (which I typically have paid $5 - $6 everywhere I've been) started at $23. I managed to get them down to $10, which was still too high so I walked away from two of them. Really wanting the spoon, I finally gave in and bought from the third vendor for the $10. When we returned to the hotel, I found the same exact spoon in the hotel gift shop for the same price...$10. In my opinion, it wasn't worth the hassle of negotiating for the same price, unless you really enjoy that type thing. The vendors that came into the hotel on Thursday evening where also priced very high with room to negotiate, but I still wasn't impressed with their prices, even after walking away. They are all somewhat pushy and anxious to show their stuff. All tables seem to carry somewhat the same merchandise.We tried all the restaurants except the fish which shares the same roof as the Rodeo steak house near the beach. My husband wasn't impressed with the quality cut of sirloin he ordered. After ordering it medium it was delivered rare-raw. He sent it back and it came back still rare, but he ate it anyway. He's very picky with regards to fat or gristle in his meat so wasn't pleased. I would have to say that was his worst experience all week. No other complaints about the food..everything we had was very good to excellent, including the Filet Mignon at Le Gourmet. Although it wasn't typical of what we are use to at home. The cut was more the thickness of a sirloin steak and was served with brown mushroom gravy. Still excellent though.There was some slight communication issues, but we went there fully expecting that. They certainly would not prevent me from returning.

<Content>Majestic Madness My husband and I just returned from a trip to Punta Cana in the DR at the the Majestic Colonial hotel. This is our 5th trip to the DR and our second time to Punta Cana.This is a brand new hotel that opened in December with some problems. The biggest problem we had with the hotel is that they have built way too many rooms to accomodate the facilities that they have available to their guests. The week that we were here we heard there were over 1400 guests staying here.There are two restaurants for which you had to make reservations for if you wanted to eat at them. A french restaurant and a japanese restaurant. On our second day here we decided we'd like to make reservations to eat at the japanese restaurant. When we went to make the reservations we were told that there was nothing left at either restaurant for the rest of our 6 day stay. We were put on a wait list and were told they'd call us if something opened up. Needless to say we were never called. We only ate in the buffet for breakfast which was good , but it is all enclosed and there are a lot flies buzzing around. Our first night here we ate at the steakhouse which is pretty good. The second to last night that we were here we went back to steakhouse and were told that it would be close to an hour long wait to be seated for dinner. Approximately a half hour later we were seated. Many people left after we got there who did not wish to wait an hour. By far the best restaurant was the carribean/mexican restaurant. The burritos were great and if you're looking for local specialties of the island they have them there and are quite good. For being what I think is the best restaurant that we have tried at the resort it was never too crowded and the waiters are very attentive there. At the grill near the beach for lunch the hamburgers are terrible! Some weird brownish pink color. My husband, the hamburger conaisseur, took one bite and could not finish it. Salads and fresh fruit are good. The last few days my husband and I both had some stomach problems but nothing too serious.The beach is very picturesque, but again crowded. On our first day here we went to find two chairs under a tiki hut at about 10am in the morning and found that not only could we not find a tiki hut but that we couldn't even find a chair. There were many towels on empty chairs that people had left out to hold their spots. My husband had to drag a chair from the pool over so we could sit at the beach. The very aggravating thing was that we found out that people get up at 6am in the morning to reserve a place at the beach. So the next day in order to get a place at the beach we got up at 6am to put our things out at the beach. Towards one of our last days here my husband and I went to go play volleyball on the beach and when we had come back we had found that someone had moved a chair next to us just practically 1 inch from my husbands. We sat down and you would think the woman would get the hint and move away but she didn't and once we saw some chairs free up close to us we were forced to move away because she wouldn't. The pool is very nice but noisy over there with a lot of people hanging out by the pool bar. One day my husband and I dediced to hang out by the pool but decided it was too noisy and wanted to go to the beach. Of course it was full but we managed to find some chairs. One group of people actually had the audacity to put a palm leaf over 4 chairs to reserve them. My husband was so irritated by that, that he asked a security guard if he could move it and take the chairs. The security guard said of course so we moved over there and no one ever claimed those were their seats. The rooms are actually quite nice. Our room was literally the first among the bunch of many rooms. We were put on the first floor practically right next to the theater so any night we wanted to go to bed early we could always hear the show and many people walking about outside. We found more mosquitos in our room than outside. A mosquito net would be a good idea for the bed there were so many. There is a nice jacuzzi in the room and a separate shower. No separation between the bedroom and the bathroom however, so if you have privacy issues this not the place for you. You can also hear everything that goes on in the bathroom. One night I got up to use the bathroom and upon turning on the lights I found a huge cockroach in the shower and I'm talking big!!! That was a bit disgusting to say the least.Also people were tipping here and this is suppose to be an all-inclusive resort. The staff were taking the tips and we felt giving prefence to those that did tip especially at the bars. Every other all inclusive resort we've been to the staff refused the tips. Overall we definately would not come back. There are just too many rooms and not enough facilities for the amount of people the hotel can hold. We found ourselves very irritated with the brashness of the other guests. It seemed no one felt relaxed like they were on a vacation and had all the time in the world. Everybody still had the me first mentality that you come across in our every day hectic lives.

<Content>Take It Easy - Relax - We Loved It We just returned from a two family, 9 day stay at the Majestic Colonial. The beach was great! The pool was great! The rooms were great! The people were great! Can I go on? We went snorkeling, windsurfing (instruction first then by ourselves), sailing, swimming with the dolfins, parasailing, a helicopter ride. This is what the vacation was all about.The food was OK. We ate in every restaurant and our favorites were the dominican and the steak house. The buffets have a lot of variety for picky kids as well as adults. But not close to getting a 5 star rating. That is not what we went there for. We went for all of the great reasons above. So, facilities and beach - outrageously great. Food -solidly OK - nothing more but nothing less. All in all above average and getting better every day from what I can tell.The staff was very friendly and tried hard to please even the very unreasonable guests. We had one problem with the room reservation but we were easy going about the problem and it was resolved way to our favor within a reasonable time. Not in the fist-banging, right away, New York minute of the US, but within reason and pleasantly.Getting stressed out and insistant in English will get you nowhere. Being nice in any language gets you everywhere. The hotel must have hired every really nice person within 100 miles. No creeps. Everyone smiles and says hello (hola!).Take to heart the suggestion to bring everything you need! My $7 aloe aftersun product was $26 at the hotel. I would go back in a New York second and have a liesurely Dominican Republic vacation. We had a great time. Chill!

<Content>Nice and Laid Back The Majestic was nice. Right from the start the staff was very helpful. The room was quite large, and definitely gave you the feeling that you were in a colonial setting, straight out of the Ethan Allen commercial. The buffet was quite good, with great variety to suite many tastes. We were unable to get reservations at the Japanese restaurant, as we stayed under 7 days. However the French restaurant was good, and they were willing to give you as many entres as you wanted. We enjoyed the Caribbean restaurant, as well as the seafood restaurant. The beach was nice, but I agree with everyone here, get there by 8-8:30 if you want an umbrella. They really come in handy if you get a little rain. The entertainment staff was also great and provided everything from pool sports, to beach soccer, to dance lessons, to shows at night, to dancing at the Sports Bar/ Club.It was definitely a pleasant hotel.

<Content>5 Star Sometimes, 1 Star others My fiance and I just returned from a 6 day stay at the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana, and though we had a good time, it could have been a whole lot better. I'm going to break down different aspects of the resort, and hopefully you will find this helpful.Room - The room itself is beautiful, all marble and very spacious. The double sink is very nice, as is the oversize shower built for the 2 and the jacuzzi is wonderful. It made the room have a very honeymoonish feel. The layout is a little revealing, but for a couple it is perfect. However, if you have kids, I would not recommend this resort, as the layout of the room is not very condusive to having any privacy. Another negative about the room is the bed, which is a ROCK! I like a firm bed, but this was like sleeping on the floor, and the pillows are extremely cheap and thin. Beach - The beach is beautiful, very spacious, and the water is gorgeous. There are a lot of chairs, but lots of people play the towel game, which is annoying, so if you want a spot in the shade, you might want to get out there early and drop a towel or two on some chairs. Personally, I just asked people at the beach if anyone was using the chairs with towels on them, and if they said no, those towels got tossed. I recommend doing the same.Pool - The pool is very nice and seemingly endless, and though some people have complained about the noise, there are very few times where loud activities are going on, and the pool is big enough that you can go to one end and never hear anything. The Pool has a bar and a swim-up bar, but one major negative about the pool is that it closes at 6pm. With temperatures still in the 80's well past 6pm (and no part of the pool is deeper than 4 1/2 feet), I saw no reason why the pool wouldn't be open until 11pm. Also the jacuzzi is just an extension of the pool with jets attached, and not a hot tub.Bars - The bars are plentiful and it is never hard to get a drink, but as a previous reviewer remarked, there just doesn't seem to be any management/supervision of any of the bar staff. The staff is friendly enough, but their drink-making knowledge leaves much to desire. Also, the bars do not have cranberry or pineapple juice, making many tropical concoctions impossible to make, which I found extremely annoying. Lastly, the all-inclusive tag only applies to rail liquor, as anything above cheap dominican rum and vodka costs much american dollars ($10 for Grey Goose on the rocks)Food - On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give the food a 3, and that is generous. My fiance and I stayed for 6 days and by day 4, we literally dreaded going to eat. Every meal we ate after day 4 we left with a slight stomach ache, which makes it hard to enjoy the rest of the resort. Breakfast and lunch are both only available at the buffet, which never changes their spread. You can get by on fruit and donuts, but pretty much everything else is pretty nasty. The omelets taste funny as the cheese used isn't real cheese (I don't think there is any milk in the cheese they use) but some sort of disgusting cheese made of filler. Lunch isn't much better, as the cold cut tray and cheese tray that has been sitting out for 2 hours doesn't do much to whet the appetite. Dinner is the easiest meal to eat, as there are different restaurants to choose from, though the Japanese restaurant always seems to be booked (though if you go when it opens, there are usually spaces open later in the evening. The French restaurant is supposed to be the best, but I found the filet mignon to be comparable to a subpar London Broil and the duck appetizer tasted like old liverwurst. I recommend sticking to the Caribbean restaurant (fajitas) and the steakhouse (the pork chops) as those are at least edible. Entertainment - Subpar is how I would describe it. The nightly shows are slightly entertaining, but there is really nothing going on during the day whereas other resorts I've stayed at had well organized trivia games, water polo games, volleyball games and things of that nature. This resort had none of that. Also, the casino doesn't open until 8pm, and the blackjack rules give the house even more of an edge (they don't check for blackjack with an ace or a face showing, making it impossible to double on an 11 vs. a face card or an ace... a major disadvantage if you're a basic strategy kind of blackjack player)Overall, I would compare this resort to an incredibly beautiful dumb girl. You'll love it the first couple of days, as the beauty of the resort will overwhelm you, but as you dig a little deeper, you'll become bored with the lack of substance underneath the initial beauty.

<Content>Great but not 5 Star We just spent 8 days with 2 other couples at the Majestic the 1st week of March. Everything was great including the food. The management went out of their way to accomodate us. We had requested 3 rooms next to each other. When we got there, 2 rooms were together and 1 was down near the end. The balcony overlooked a roadway and a wooded area. We went to the desk and spoke with the manager. Within 2 days we were in rooms next to each other with the balcony overlooking the pool and with an ocean view. All of the people that worked there that we had contact with were very friendly and helpful. My only complaint was that they charge high prices for top shelf liquor. If they are a 5 Star resort, that should be included in the price.Other than that, we all agreed that we would go back again

<Content>One of the Best I've been in The Majestic was an awesome resort. It was quite large in size, relative to other PC resorts. The pool was enourmous, there were many bars throughout the place. The rooms were the best I have ever stayed in; large and elegant. The entire place is 5 stars and definetly top notch. The only downside for me was that the resort was so new (only opened since december '05) that management had not yet establihsed the dive shop---or water sport bungolo on the beach. By consequence. No parasailing, no kayaking, or other water related activities. Sure the hotel offers tours, but the beach water sports was a let down. The beach was huge, the bathing area however was limited to a small corner--all else was full of coral and weed. Though, usually there were not many people in the water anyway, so there was no problem finding a clean spot on the beach. Outside of that I had a great time--the food was great! Except the chinese place--it was awful, all else was fantastic.Even the casino, I saw some poeple actually win pretty big with the slots. By the way, it is a bit out there from the PC airport, took about 35 to 40 minutes to get to the resort from the airport. Overall, I would recommend it. I will most probably return, hopefully the water sports is setup by then.

<Content>Loved it! My husband and I went with another couple to this resort. Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised with a free upgrade to an Oceanfront room. It was absolutely gorgeous! Our friends had a poolview room which was also beautiful with an outside jacuzzi. The pool is so big that you're not crowded at all when you're in it. Getting chairs is a little difficult..you have to put your towels out early. We stayed on the beach more, since that too was soooo beautiful with turquoise waters and didn't find it noisy at all. They were plenty of watersports to enjoy if you chose to do so...what I liked best was that no one pestered you to do or buy anything. If you said no, they said okay and left. Only the people employed by the resort to schedule the watersports or tours are allowed. No local vendors are on the beach at all which was nice.The Japanese restaurant was by far the best. But make your reservation as soon as you check in...it's really worth it. The buffets were okay..the breakfast one was better than lunch, but you never went hungry, there was such a variety. If you didn't like one restaurant, just move on to another! I found everyone there to be so friendly and helpful. I didn't have any language problems with any of them and I don't speak Spanish at all. The rooms are marble, spacious and clean. For a couple, privacy was not an issue.The shower is huge and amazing as is the in-room jacuzzi. Our maid never bothered us..in fact we never saw her once...just always came back to a clean room. Another fellow stocks your refrigerator with as much of whatever it is you want..soda, water, or beer.He comes by in the morning, but never too early. Usually after we got back from breakfast. The buffet does end at 10:00am but it's worth getting up for! Such a variety and great omelets!We hated to leave and would definitely go back if the price doesn't go up too much. I disagree with all the negative reviews previously posted and encourage anyone who's thinking of going to this resort to only pay attention to the positive reviews. Couple of things to bring...bar of soap, facecloth and an insulated mug for your drinks. They will fill any size! Didn't need my bugspray that I had brought, never had any stomach issues, and found the pillows to be totally comfortable. I loved it!

<Content>Liked the Majestic - but got very sick from the buffet. 3/6 - 3/13 I have to say that I really liked everything about the resort - but after eating at the Buffet on the 3rd day I became violently ill as described by some earlier reviews of this resort. My husband did not get sick, but we do not eat the identical food. I thought I was being careful in my choices and never experienced this level of throwing up and runs in the 20 years I have been visiting simular all inclusives throughout the Caribbean. I lost two days of my vacation and my digestive system is starting to return to normal. By the way, I drink very little that is alcoholic and know my limits in the sun so this was not the cause - and believe me this was no flu virus. Also, I did not drink the tap water or even brush my teeth in it. I am not sure if I would return or not. Maybe once the resort is more established and the reviews don't mention people getting sooo sick.

<Content>You'll LOVE this place! First of all, I have absolutely NO idea where the real negative comments come from, other than some people love to find things to complain about.This place was top notch, the grounds, the service, the people (ESPECIALLY their efforts), the guests, the pool, etc. The food could improve to be great, but after a day or so, you know where to find the great eats. The buffet had such a selection that there wasn't a problem finding something you like, don't forget, YOU ARE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, and they cater to Americans, Europeans, and Canadians, etc. so it isn't going to be all steaks and chicken! But you can find good pizza, FRESH turkey or a roast, tons of different vegetables/rices. EVERY person working there (even the maintenance crew, whom I asked for ice for my cerveza and he brought up a bucket of ice and two 6-packs of Presedente), whether it'd be a waitress, maid, bartender, one of the entertainment crew, tried their hardest to help you out AND to speak english, and completely appreciated it when you TRIED to throw some spanish into it. The maid whom maintained our room was excellent, always had a packed fridge with beers and water, and even folded clothes for us. The only place I didn't get a smile was in the casino, BUT that's their job (and if you're nice to them, they'll flash a smile and a wink).There were things to improve on, but in no way was it a problem. It's a huge place and it's only been open for 3 mo. Maybe the music by the pool bar was loud when they had games going on, but the pool is 150 yds+ long, there are PLENTY of places to go to get away, but it was all to entertain and it was VERY entertaining. Food wasn't available 24 hrs a day, like a late night pizza/beer bar, but there is a midnight buffet. Sometimes you cannot get 'reservations' for certain restaurants, but if you're nice to a waiter or bartender, you can ask them to get you on a list or even just walk in, they'll sit you, didn't have one problem with that. Top shelf liquors aren't served, but their stuff isn't so bad, didn't find it to be an issue and I'm a drinker.I could write on and on about this place, to sum it up, you're crazy if you go and don't have a good time. I COMPLETELY recommend this resort, ESPECIALLY in a couple of months when all of the kinks are worked out and the staff gets comfortable working with the visitors. If you go in with a positive attitude and aren't afraid to meet people, and TRY to speak some basic spanish, you're going to enjoy every minute and want to return to this place. I guarentee, if you catch the name of a waiter or bartender and greet them with a personal hola, you're setting yourself up to have a great time. If you go in ready to be miserable, you're going to find little things to complain about.If you're thinking about going here and are just trying to get a feel for it via these reviews, GO, you won't regret it.

<Content>great, if you've never been anywhere else... the beaches are beautiful. however, each morning a staff member starts a workout area in the center of the beach with a loud speaker system screaming nonsense, so you need to move to the opposite side for some peace. second, the quality of the room was very poor. every night we had to air-out the room for 10 mins just to get the smell out. third, the staff are friendly but really didn't know what they were doing. each morning we were awoken to a staff member hammering the tiles outside of our door to apparently check for weak tiles or something?!? fourth, the food was very weak. you were never crowded at the buffet, but you were eating second quality food and the service was spotty. fifth, the crowd is like spring break for sixty year olds, boozing in the afternoon playing drinking games at the pool with a loud and obnoxious staff member screaming garbled english into another sound system. again, no peace at all. on the island itself, there are no places to shop unless you like being harassed by locals selling awful paintings (but, that holds true for most of the world.) listen, i don't want to sound super negative, but to write that this is a four or five star hotel is a complete joke.

<Content>Improvement still needed I just returned from a 10 day stay at the Majestic. Overall the experience was a positive one, but there are some areas which need to be improved in order to rate this a 5 star resort.Good: as has been mentioned before, the Beach is fabulous and the pool area is lovely. One does have to get up early to reserve beach chairs at both area each day. The staff are generally very friendly and accomodating, although the lack of English hampers their ability to communicate effectively. I think this will improve over time. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Traveling with a group of three was a bit of a problem. It seems they set up the rooms for either 2 or 4 guests. It took a few requests to get them to leave enough towels, glasses and bottles of water for 3 people. Eventually they got it and our room was stocked appropriately after that. We requested a third bed and it was provided without charge. The idea of the bathroom opening right into the bedroom is not a plus as far a I can see. Whether you are a couple, a family or just friends traveling together, everyone likes a certain amount of privacy in the bathroom. The food was ok though somewhat repetitive on the buffets. The Japanese restaurant was by far the best. The breakfast buffet ended at 10:00, which I think is a little early when you are on vacation.The bad:The landscaping has a way to go. It appears to have been put in hastily and now there was a lot of replanting going on while we were there. New plants were being added and new topsoil applied, so that should improve over time.Entertainment was very amateurish. They would do well to hire some staff with some dance and voice training to put together some better after dinner shows.Music in general is extremely loud. The bar by the pool blasts out Spanish hip hop music all day long. The canned music at the shows is way louder than it needs to be.The resort is quite isolated, so we never ventured out side. The people that we spoke to re the excursions said that more time was spent on the bus than at the destination, so we decided not to go on any.Shopping was limited to the flea market which came one day and at the hotel gift shops. The items in the gift shops were very expensive. The single worse thing about this resort was the quality of the construction. This place has only been open since December and we witnessed tiles missing from the bathrooms, chipped marble in the showers, broken concrete on the pool decks. Our lites over the bathroom mirror were working intermittantly or not at all. We called the desk to have it repaired. A handyman came to look at it, but it was never fixed. I mention the construction, as I wonder about safety and comfort for future guests. If this is to be a 5 star resort with expensive rates, they will have to deal with this asap.

<Content>Wow !! we were very impressed My husband and I have just returned from a fantastic vacation at the MC. We were so impressed with the elegance of the resort. We stayed for one week and had a very relaxing vacation.The ocean was very beautiful. A turqoise color. There were many fish to see if snorkeling is your thing. I would recommend that you go out early in the morning before the speed boats start going back and forth. Our room was great. It was very big and clean. The maid came every morning and our fridge was stocked daily.The food was amazing !!! We especially enjoyed the buffet for breakfast and lunch. For dinner we usually went to one of their restaurants on the resort. The beach restaurant was very good. I recommend the Chateau Briand with baked potato and sour cream. We also went to the Gourmet restaurant. It was delicious as well. We had the filet mignon.The atmosphere is so... friendly there. The staff was extremely helpful, friendly and always a smile on there faces. They would always greet you with a hola! My goodness they work hard over there. One hostess I got to know a little told me that she works 12 days on and has 3 days off. Her hours were from 7 am to 9 pm.The pool was magnificent. It was the largest pool I have ever seen at any resort I have been to.The entertainment staff were very friendly. They also put on a great show in the evenings. My favorite was the Dominican Folklore and the Michael Jackson show. A must see.The casino was fun however it is very small. The Disco was small as well. One drink that I really enjoyed was called a dirty monkey. You gotta try it. It was delicious.I can't comment on the excursions as we decided not to participate.When you arrive there (after check in) go directly to the guest services table in the lobby and reserve your day and time for the Japanese and Gourmet restaurant. It fills up very quickly.The sun is very strong there so remember to apply sun screen often. Also another tidbit... You can drink the water at the restaurants and buffet but do not drink the tap water. Also squeeze some lime into your water. Apparently it kills parasites and bacteria.My husband and I also brought some papaya tablets and bromeline. You can get these two tablets at your health food store. We had one of each after every meal and we did not get sick at all.Well, hope that this review will be helpful. We would love to go back again however in a year or so it will be too expensive.Have a great vacation and don't worry about a thing.

<Content>Great resort and beautiful beach I returned from the Majestic Colonial March 11. I stayed there for a week with my husband and another couple, all late twenties/early thirties. We loved the resort and would return again. The room was very spacious and we didn't mind the open concept although the toilet could be more private. Unfortunately we had a room with 2 double beds instead of a king but I think my husband was secretly pleased with this so he could stretch out by himself. There were no face clothes available.We ate at all of the restaurants. Our friend called his experience a gastronomical delight and we all enjoyed most of the food. Buffets all good, Japanese/Chinese good, gourmet only OK, steak good, seafood only OK. Our Transat vacation rep advised us that the only thing that would make us sick was eating too much and getting out of our usual food habits and she was right. By the end of the week I was stuffed to the brim, but not sick- just too many freshly fried donuts.The beach was wonderful. The sand is fine and the water warm. There was snorkeling offshore and the waves were fun to play in. There were lots of palapas and palm trees for shade. We walked 30 minutes (briskly) to the market on the beach which had the usual touristy type of goods for sale.The pool was long and not too crowded. The section of pool by the bar closer to the beach was loud in the afternoon from the entertainment team and games but the other sections were fine. The swim up bar was never too crowded.Overall, we really enjoyed the resort. The buildings are all very large, open and airy. We found the staff was attentive and friendly. For a resort with 600 rooms, we found the crowds to be well controlled and dispersed well (wonder if filled to capacity yet). We paid $1300 CDN pp for the week and felt that was a good deal. I could see this trip costing $500-$1000 more in the future when the resort matures.

<Content>You have to out of your mind not to like this place You have to be out of your mind not to like this place. We arrived on Feb.14 and stayed a week. There was 6 of us and all enjoyed everybit of this place. The layout of this resort is perfect. Right from the lobby, to the length of the pool, to the rooms. Anyone going soon, just enjoy yourselves and have fun. Food was good, lots of bars, excellent beach with lots of shade and snorkling right out front. Walk the beach it's gorgous. If you don't wanna see the shows then go and listen to the nightly sax and keyboard entertainment which we enjoyed very much just to relax. It really is a nice place and would definatly go back!!!!!

<Content>Great sun, great fun! We just got back from a week at the majestic Colonial in Punta Cana. After reading some decidely mixed reviews before we went, here are our thoughts!The resort is BEAUTIFUL! The pool is absolutely amazing, the ocean is clean and clear and there's a reef full of really cool fish right off the beach in the protected swimming area. The rooms are very nice too. We arrived on a Sunday, and as we checked in the clerk asked us if there was anything we wanted. We said, how about an upgrade-- and we got one! From gardenview to poolside. It was a GREAT room, 10 steps to the pool and 20 to the bar.We had a jacuzzi in the room and one on the porch, which we took full advantage of. It was really great!As for the food, we thought it was very good. Not excellent, but very good. We would have liked more a la carte restaurants, but the buffet was interesting and changed food each night, so it was just fine. Other posters have written of the need to make reservations immediately upon arrival for the gourmet and the japanese restaurants, and that is important. We met a couple who waited until the day after arrival and couldn't get into the japanese place. We only got in on the last night of our stay! Which led us to ask exactly who was getting all the reservations earlier in the week....The disco was kind of lame, at least when we went it was full of 14 year olds dancing to YMCA.(by the Village People). The casino was OK, small, but it's not supposed to be Vegas!The bars were great, and many of the bartenders were great! There was one bartender who did not seem at all happy to be there, so we just avoided that bar.The service was good, not excellent, but good. Do ask for another bed pillow, the beds are firm and an extra pillow will go far to make it more comfortable.We would go back to the majestic, and would recommend it to others looking for a great 4-star experience!

<Content>Bad bad bad Wow I do not think I have enough space here to write everything that is wrong with this place.....I just came back form this so called Majestic resort and found it far from majestic. If you want rude service and guest (French) then this is the place for you. I was not allowed into the so-called gourmet dining rooms because I did not bring pants on this trip. The guest-service rep even questioned me about not having pants and was suggesting that I was lying to him. I have dined in some of the best places in Boston and worn shorts how can this place be any different. All in all it was terrible and will make it my goal to tell as many people as possible about this terrible place.

<Content>A very beautiful hotel My husband and I were at Majestic Colonial with two more couples from February 10 - 24. We were very impressed with the lovely room. Very large with a separate spa bath. A large walk-in shower, a king size bed and a beautiful patio. We were on the opposite side of the pool but enjoyed it, as it was more quiet. The room services were very good. I have learned from this experience that bringing gifts for the dominican children does not always work out. The maids prefer tips. The food and service are great at the buffet, you have a big variety of foods which changes now and then. We have tried all of the Restaurants, our favorite was Japanese, second the Chinese as we love sushi which they had plenty. Following the sushi you can order a la carte. The worst restaurant was the Caribean. I should also mentioned that they need a lot more experience in cooking the lobster at the Steak and Lobter restaurant. We found that cooking the lobster on the grill was always overcooked and burned. We have been to many different places and Republic Dominican and found that their drinks are very much the same with the rum. Rum this, rum that. One drink we found which was great is their caesars they have discovered clamato juice. Yes! When it comes to tours, watch out they are getting more expensive and less for your money. We took the Aquamarina Tour, swimming with the sharks and stinray was o.k. but the lunch was dry slices of bread and you had to make your own with slices of ham and cheese. We took one tour we thought was worth the price and that is the helicopter tour. Expensive but cheap if you figure how much it would cost you if you would do it at home. We took the 30 minute tour taking us all along the coast and inland. We could see most of the different tours on the coast and all the many different resorts. It was the most beautiful experience I have ever had. They have nightly entertainment, they need better performance but one of the shows was Michael Jackson, that one was the greatest. They need more games and entertainement for the people to participate. They should give prizes or gifts if they want people to be part. All in all I would return again, hoping they would look after some of the little kinks since it is a new hotel and hope the plants and trees would be bigger. P.S no mosquitoes per say to worry about!!

<Content>Very Nice - couple minor problems but would return We just returned from a 2 week vacation at the Majestic Colonial, Feb 17 鈥?Mar 3. On the whole this was a wonderful trip to a beautiful location. The resort itself is very nice and I feel that once they have been in operation for a while and work out some of the kinks in service, it will be a wonderful resort.Here are the highlights of the resort and our vacation:EXCELLENT/VERY GOOD/GOOD:MAIN RESORT:The resort itself is very well done. Once the landscaping takes hold and grows in, the resort will be very beautiful. Lots of top quality materials have been used in the buildings. There are lots of tiles (ceramic  marble), lots of wood, large glass windows in the lobby and dining rooms/restaurants, and the washroom facilities in the main buildings are very nice. There are many elevators throughout the resort 鈥?two in the main lobby, and many throughout the accommodations area as well.The rooms are extraordinary. They are large with a bedroom area, sitting area, Jacuzzi tub, dual vanity and wc/shower. Other reviewers have described them quite well 鈥?the wc is very small and not all that private, but I considered this a minor issue. GYM:The gym is well equipped 鈥?two treadmills, two elliptical machines, several machines (sorry not sure what these are called) for weight-type workouts (leg press, shoulder press, etc.); there were probably 6 or more of these machines all designed to work a separate set of muscles.POOL:It鈥檚 hard to say enough about the pool. At 400 meters long, it spans virtually the entire length of the resort and it鈥檚 beautiful. Bridges cross it at many locations so you can travel from one side of the resort to the other. A ledge runs along most of the one side so you can put loungers along the edge in the shallow water. The water isn鈥檛 heated but doesn鈥檛 need to be 鈥?the water temperature is perfect. Small islands are placed throughout the pool for aesthetics. The pool is the best I鈥檝e seen anywhere. There is still some work to be done around the pool area 鈥?it looks like tiles are planned but aren鈥檛 in place yet. Even without the tiles, the pool area is pretty fine without them. There is some minor crumbling of the concrete in one area, but I noticed a few other areas where patches have been made so I imagine this will be fixed soon.BEACH:It鈥檚 equally hard to say enough about the beach. I鈥檝e been to Puerto Plata, Mexico (Mayan Riveria) and the beach here is the best I鈥檝e seen. White sand, long gentle sloping beach area, little or no coral in the swimming area and miles of this stretching in both directions. Beautiful warm turquoise water. Simply incredible.CASINO:The casino is somewhat small 鈥?maybe 8 tables or so (blackjack, roulette, etc) and maybe 30 or so slots. Warning 鈥?the casino allows smoking so it is pretty smoky in there.CARIBBEAN STEET/SHOPS:Pretty standard. There are about 6 or 7 open. They provide your standard tourist-type items (assorted souvenirs, some clothing and toiletries) and the prices are middle of the road for the souvenirs and clothing, and outrageous for the toiletries; however, this is standard at any resort so come prepared!RESTAURANTS/FOOD:The food was fairly good and compares well to other resorts I鈥檝e been at. The Tepanyaki restaurant is probably the best of the bunch. It is becoming difficult to get a reservation there because it is so popular and can only seat 30 people per sitting (10 people each at three separate stations) so make your reservations as soon as you arrive.NOT SO GOOD/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:KIDS/KIDS CLUB:The kids club is not completed. It looks like it will be a very nice facility when done 鈥?a castle, a separate pool, games area, etc. However, because it isn鈥檛 yet finished the kids are present everywhere in the resort. Normally, the kids club keeps the noisy youngsters occupied during the day so they aren鈥檛 mixed in with the adults but until the kids club is completed expect lots of noisy youngsters during your stay.There is a separate kids pool in the main area, but it didn鈥檛 seem to be well used. This is probably because it is located in the main activity area where the adult activities/games/dancing take place 鈥?not the best location for a kid鈥檚 pool! So 鈥?I witnessed several youngsters, some in diapers, being waded through the main swimming area. Yuck 鈥?please keep kids in diapers in the kids pool.ENTERTAINMENT:Although the entertainment team worked hard, the entertainment was sub-par to other resorts I鈥檝e been at. The best show is the Micheal Jackson entertainer. They do your standard Miss/Mr. Majestic and perfect couple type shows which count on the silliness of the audience attendees to make the show. Other than that, the dancing shows are boring and repetitive.ACTIVITIES:Compared to other resorts this could use some improvement as well, and I expect it will improve as the staff become more experienced. Other resorts often have organized activities 鈥?tennis, archery, shooting, soccer, aerobics, dance lessons, etc. Here, you will get only the basics 鈥?aerobics and afternoon entertainment/activity (3:00 鈥?5:00 by the main activities area).SNACKS:There are no real 鈥渟nack鈥?foods available. At other resorts there is usually a 鈥渟nack bar鈥?which provides things like burgers, hot dogs, pizza, popcorn, nachos, ice cream, etc. to the beach/pool area throughout the day. Here, there is a beach area restaurant that has bugers/hot dogs, but it is really a restaurant (rice, potatoes, meat, salads, etc). You cannot find true 鈥渟nack鈥?food anywhere.WASHROOM AVAILABILITY:For the entire bottom half of the pool area and beach, there is one washroom which only has two women鈥檚 stalls. Consequently, there is a constant lineup anytime from noon until about 5:00pm so be prepared to wait鈥?.SERVICE:The level of service provided at the restaurants is mediocre; I suspect this is due to the 鈥渘ewness鈥?of the resort. The staff work very hard but despite this, the service is very poor. It was difficult to get coffee or drinks (sometimes had to 鈥渇lag鈥?servers down multiple times to receive service) and taking orders in the restaurants took a very long time. At other resorts I鈥檝e been to, normally your coffee/drinks are filled immediately and are refilled as soon as they are half empty 鈥?that level of service is non-existent here. You will be fortunate if you get a refill on coffee or drinks. I expect this will improve once the resort has been in operation longer.DRINKS:Simply awful. The resort was advertised as unlimited local and international brand drinks being included and it simply isn鈥檛 true 鈥?I will be taking this up with our travel agent now that I鈥檝e returned. Pretty much only 鈥渓ocal鈥?varieties of alcohol are included so if you鈥檙e looking for any kind of liqueurs, or specialty drinks be prepared to pay extra. In addition, the 鈥渓ocal鈥?varieties of alcohol offered leave a lot to be desired. A gin and tonic with the variety of gin they are serving tasted pretty awful. The only cocktails that are included are a standard set that they will almost always make based on the 鈥渟lushy鈥?machines running in the bars 鈥?90% sugar 鈥?you can only stomach so much of this. Spoke to other people staying at 4* and 4*+ resorts nearby and they were getting anything and everything they asked for, including Grand Marnier, Bailey鈥檚, Frangellico, etc. all included and I have had this as well at other 4* resorts. For this resort to claim to be a 5* and to advertise international brand drinks included and to not include even the basics was very very disappointing.On the whole, I was very pleased with our stay. The facilities are nice. Most of the 鈥渃omplaints鈥?I had can be easily addressed through service changes and I expect these will probably occur as the resort gets more operations experience under its belt. I would definitely return. I expect by next year the service issues will all be addressed and this will be a truly spectacular resort. Mind you, by that time I expect the prices will rise accordingly :)

<Content>Activities where are they? Hey all just got back from the Dominican .republic stayed at the Majestic (feb 21 to 28)this is a good and bad review.the Good.Beach no trouble getting a place on the beachesBars, many of them at good locations, fair variety of drinksStaff, pleasant although some will go further then others in trying to help make it an enjoyable vacation.Rooms, clean sort of... we made the mistake of tipping on the first day our maid never improved or took the extra step in maintaining the room (I don't think the shower was ever cleaned!) However the maid for room 3402 went above and beyond the call of duty... towel art, over stocked fridge ect..)grounds, spacious will become extreemly beautiful in a year or two, need to do a little work on paths but overall nice design.Food, Now i can't stress this enough when you get your room from the front desk as the person helping you how to get to guest services. Go to guest services tell them you would like to book the Japanese and the gourmet restaurants try to book two of each. There is no limit on how many times you can book a reservation.Japanese, the max capacity for the japanese restaurant is 8 people X3 (because you sit around the bar as the chef prepares the meal). the meal is always the same so if you book this more than once try and spread it out. applaude for your chef before accepting each serving that the chef prepares.tip-- at this restaurant I tipped the chef 3 dollars and the server (name was Chris or Christien) two dollars.Gourmet, we ate here twice (lamb excellent and fillet minion (steak wraped with bacon yum)), there is lobster and shrimp and some type of chicken stuffed with a tastey green veggie of unknown name. the desert is mouth watering and the service is excellent.tip-- we had one server and then two roving people, the server spoke english, was helpful and polite. I tipped him 5 dollars, i felt the service was above anyhting else here except the lobby bar....Lobby bar.. Fausto the ceaser king.. if you like Ceasers then start tipping fausto, he's got a little grey in his hair but the man makes a mean ceaser.. I think i tipped about a dollar to two dollars a day since his bar is always open and he works about a ten hour day. this bar serves drinks in glass and he makes a ceaser with about 4 or 5 ounces of vodka and a small can of clamato and spice...Yummmmy!!BAD BAD BADMy biggest complaint as an activities, rest on the beach and then more activities type of person is that there was no adult schedule of events. Kids had a schedule why not adults?so here's the day's schedule: 10:30 to 10:45 beach side aerobics (Get Antonio (orange hair) the other guy is a running nazi!! Guys wait untill 10:45 then merge with the group from the back... trust me the scenery is worth it... if the Running nut is there don't join... trust me!11:00 Beach Volley ball, just join up people will keep comming.12:00 12:30ish sometimes without any consistency during the week there will be games at the bar attached to the swiming pool bar. Games include tennis ball throw (prize is a mickey of goooood rum), cerveza (beer) drinking contest (prize=rum), dance competition (rum) and team beer drinking contest (prize applause but by that point you really won't care!!)3:00ish same as 12:004:00 beach Volley ball5:00 back to the bar do the Toma Toma dance that ends with the majestic cheer (this sometimes happend at the same time as volley ball.Language skills, As a new resort they need to start (if they haven't) training their staff in english and french.Sanck locations... very hard to find... on the last day we discovered that if you go to guest services and ask they will provide you with a schedule for when all the bars and places to eat are open!! make sure you get this list.Rain... it only last for twenty minutes at the most so if it's raining don't cancel or skip anything because it doesn't last long. Even clouds don't last long in the d.r. sun.IMPORTANT IMPORTANT Introduce yourself to anyone who serves you, ask their name Como se yama? (your name is?) and use it. The people in D.r. are touchy feely and using first names improves service and intrest, shake hands, smile eye contact. Trust me this works. and even if it doesn't it never hurts to be polite!!como sounds like comma (,) with an oh instead of an ah at the end. se sounds like the c in C.d.yama sounds like the yama in Yamaha (motorcycles)well that's it except for night life by 12:30 1:00 am it dies off, there is none, if you enjoyed the night life in Cancun and hope to find it here don't go to the DR. or at least Punta Cana.best of wishes on weather for everyone going, Remember May is their Rainy Season!

<Content>Great resort We stayed at the Majestic Colonial in the third week of February and found it to be a beautifull resort. We arrived late at night and checked in very quickly. We had a garden view room and wanted an upgrade, however, even after offering a tip, ($20), the employee still said there was no other rooms available and to return the next day. Once in the room, we found the air conditioning not working, and were eventually moved to another room, (pool view). It was difficult to communicate with some of the employee's when we tried to tell them about the problem, but eventually, we found a manager who spoke english very well and he helped us out and then some. I wish I knew his name because he was just excellent to deal with. The rooms themselves were gorgeous and spacious. The shower is amazing. The only issue I think some would have, is the privacy of the toilet. There is no privacy, LOL. Be comfortable with who you are with!!! Although not yet completed, the resort itself was stunning. Beautifull pool running straight through the resort, with plenty of bars to get a drink. I was reading another review and they said that they were charged for champaigne. We drank a ton of it, including the bottle in the room and were never charged. We ordered whatever we wanted and got no problems at all. The staff was excellent. Some didn't speak english at all, however, most made the attempt to understand and were very very impressed by their hospitality. Our room was cleaned everyday, and lots of towels and water were there when we returned from the beach. A $2 tip each day helped I think. Although all inclusive, we made sure we tipped our waiters/waitresses and bartenders. This not only helped us get better service, but these people work their butts off to make your stay is a memorable one and dont get paid very much. They will always say hello, and always have a smile on their faces, treat them well. Entertainment at night was fun. Go see Michael Jackson if you can. Overall, the resort, beach and staff are all excellent, and when fully matured, this resort will definately represent what a five star should be.

<Content>Had a Great Time My boyfriend and I stayed here from February 12th to the 19th, and we had a wonderful,relaxing vacation.The pool is absolutely beautiful, and is never too crowded, but I am very much more of a beach person. For the first few days, we got up early and put our towels on the beach, but we decided that was a waste of time, as you could go down there and find chairs whenever you wanted. The beach was incredible, the nicest I've ever seen (this was my first trip to the Dominican, but I have been to Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and Mazatlan in Mexico) and it raked and cleaned throughout the day.The food was for the most part very good. I am a very picky eater, and I didn't have a problem finding things that I liked to eat. There were a few things that I was hesitant to try however. I didn't attempt to make any reservations until day 4 of our 7 day vaction. I was unable to get us into the Japanese restaurant, but we did get into the Gourmet on our last night, and our meal was fantastic. (I had the lobster au gratin, and my boyfriend had the fillet minion). The only meal we didn't enjoy was at the Chinese restaurant.We were very happy with our room, which was poolside. It was room 2122, and was across from the spa. This was a good location because it was about half way inbetween two bars, and was very quiet. We didn't use the jacuzzi tub on our terrace as, the plants aren't grown up enough to give any privacy, but we did make use of the one inside our room. The open bath concept, or lack or wash cloths weren't an issue for us.The service staff was very friendly and eager to help. There was a little bit of a language barrier, but you have to expect that. If you give them the odd tip, they are even more accomidating. We drank all of our mixed drinks with top shelf liquor and we were never charged.Anybody who complained about the mosquitos,obviously hasn't spent any time in North Western Ontario. I think I killed 4 in the week we were there. The fitness centre had very nice equiptment, and good work out music playing. I also went and had a massage at the spa which was very nice, with average pricing.My boyfriend and I snorkeled on most days, and saw tons of fish just out in front of the resort. He also went fishing one day. He didn't catch anything, but had fun trying. We went off of the resort one night for supper at Captain Cook's which was fantastic. It was $110 US for the 2 of us. That included our cab ride there (not back), a huge seafood platter that we couldn't even finish, our drinks, appetizers, and desserts. Oh yeah, they gave us a shot of mama juana too. They call it Dominican Viagra, but it just made me very sleepy.We had a great trip. The resort was beautiful, and in another year, it will be amazing. Don't worry about all the negative reviews that were posted earlier. You'll have a great time.

<Content>How can you complain? My husband and I had a goal to find a beautiful beach somewhere we had never been and have a very relaxing week away from work's pressures. The Majestic Colonial certainly filled the bill. We had anxiously watched its progress from not ready to its present state and can honestly say we weren't at all disappointed. We've stayed at many 4 and 5 star resorts on the Mayan Riviera, but had never found one where the beach, pool, restaurants, service and ambience were all top-notch. The Majestic Colonial finally made it!We experienced NO problems with the room, hot water, smells, spoiled food and foreign language of the staff - and we stayed in the cheapest room category. We were able to get into the restaurants we wanted (just make reservations ASAP when you arrive!) and had a lot of variety in the buffets, too. The landscaping is not mature, as many have mentioned, but certainly isn't ugly. There were no bugs that bothered us, and the weather was unrelentingly beautiful. Tipping wasn't necessary to receive excellent service, either, although we thanked many favorite staff members on our way out.We didn't need to make one complaint or request from the front desk during our entire stay; I think that says alot! The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star hotel (in my humble estimation)is the inclusion of all brands of liquor in the all-inclusive list. Based on what I've written here, we may very well go back to the Majestic Colonial next year.

<Content>Clean resort, nice beach We just came back from the Majestic Colonial last week (Feb 18-25). Food was good..buffet restaurant, plus seafood  steak house restaurants at he beach, japanese, french and chinese restaurants..make your reservations for the french and japanese restaurants early. We went to the japanese restaurant on our last night there and had the best meal. No issues with food/drinks..we were fine after all the warnings about dominican republic food problems in general..just be smart about not eating cream based stuff, ensure your meats are cooked coz sometimes they aren't. Bottled water everywhere. Rooms were clean; resort was clean. This is a new resort and will reach a 5 star in about a year's time after their landscapes and staff have matured. Beautiful beaches.

<Content>Gorgeous - Wonderful - Would Go Again We went Feb 16-23/06. Ignore all the complaints. I dont know what people's problems are. This is the D.R. not North America. 4 or 5 star is not a 4 or 5 star outside N.A. We had NO PROBLEMS with anything. Service, people, facilities are all great. The food is good and the 2 best restaurants are Japanese and Chinese. The steak was good. Having not been to the D.R. for 15 yrs brought back memories of just how nice people are here. They are poor but unlike anywhere else they really appreciate the $$ they get from the tourists and dont hold it against us.A/C, power ( a couple of flickers), water were all fine. The service people dont expect tips though some people were doing it but honestly if you dont tip there is no real difference. They run kids programs 8-5 and 8pm in the evening.The band is terrible though. And yes go see the Michael Jackson show. The lipsicking is bad but he/her has nailed the show and all but the sideways moonwalk was very good.We actually didnt want to go home and my wife has never done that. A week went by way too fast. People say it is similiar to the Bahia Principal just not as big. It is new so it will take some time to get to that level but definitely it is a 4 star.Go, we will go back.

<Content>Best of Dominican yet! We just returned from this resort. It has only been opened for a few months. The landscaping is developing but did not hinder our wonderful time. The staff, again new to this resort, were friendly, helpful and appeared to enjoy their work. Accommodations were superb including free in-room safe, ironing board, luscious robes and slippers, coffee maker and fully stocked fridge. They even provided glass barware! Rooms were spacious, beautiful spa tubs, walk-in showers. The services were many including free internet access. We enjoyed the piano bar with great entertainment as well as the outdoor bar with sax and keyboard. We attended the ala carte restaurants. The presentation was superb, the food delicious. We ate lunch at the beach restaurant- always fresh and tasty.The beach was great, never had a problem getting a lounge chair. You can walk for miles to the right of the resort, we were warned not to go to the left.Would highly recommend this resort for your future visits to the Dominican.

<Content>A warning to those who believe everything they read!!! This is written in response to all of those who have written negative reviews in the past about the horrible conditions of this resort and to those who are scheduled to go in the future:First the negative comments:My wife and I had terrible creatures in our room! We saw two mosquitos on the cieling of our bathroom!We saw increadibly small ants on the floor in our bathroom!There was no divider wall between the bathroom and our bedroom for privacy and my wife and I had no option but to get ready and change our clothing-in front of each other!Unlike the people who wrote that they lost weight due to the unsafe food, I actually gained about 6 pounds...even though I had to walk every day on such a long streach of beach which made me so exhausted that I was forced to lay on a lounge chair near the water relax for the rest of the day-and be subject to having to look at lovely topless woman laying all around me.The ocean water was not blue-it was a tuqoise color and was even cooler than the air-probably 80 degrees.The employees were overly polite and tried to please you so much that it got on my nerves, especially those who tried too hard to speak English, especialyy this young lady named Janet who at 24 years old should have stayed home and watched her 5 children instead of working a 14 hour shift!There were too many foreigners. Being from the US, I actually had to meet and converse with people from Russia, Canada, Germany, South America and many other countries...I actually felt outnumbered and some of them did not even know how to speak english!I can go on and on...but hopefully you get my drift.

<Content>A beautiful restful vacation My sister and I just returned (Feb 9th - Feb 16th) from staying for the first time in the Dominican Republic and at the newly opened Majestic Colonial. We were nervous before we went down about the newness of the resort so we took great comfort in reading the reviews that people had taken time to write so I am returning the favour.We found the property to be beautiful and well kept. The pool is stunning although we spent most of the time at the beach. There was no fighting for beach chairs and If you had your things out by 8 or 8:30am you could always manage to find a place and an umbrella for shade. The beach is stunning and great to walk. Our one caution is that you not pass Breezes (two hotels up) but head the other way towards the beach shopping and the major hotels. A German couple that we sat beside at dinner had been attacked and robbed of their video camera at 1pm in the afternoon on the relatively secluded beach that seems to go on for miles north of the developped area. Apparently it is not a common occurence but they were still quite shaken up. You won't have any problems if you stay where the rest of the vacationers are so that is our helpful hint. We did walk that way twice and enjoyed the solitude but after that story we chose to stay on the safe side. The hotels all have security on the property and you are never hassled while enjoying your time on the beach.Our room was on the 4th floor with a spectacular view of the ocean and beautiful sunrises as well (4420). People seem to suggest that the better rooms face the pool but we beg to differ. I would suggest to see your room first before you ask for a change.The staff was charming, helpful and extremely friendly. The breakfast buffet was endless and delicious and the coffee is grown locally and is fabulous (hot milk and hot coffee mixed).The guests were a very international mix of Spanish, French, Canadian (French and English speaking), German, and American which gave the week a very global and interesting angle.We tipped $2 u.s. everyday for the room and brought lots of singles with us so we wouldn't have to worry about getting change. I understand that the employeed (waitstaff) don't make much more than $300.00 a month so they always appreciate the extra gesture. My bartender always filled up a large thermos with my favorite beverage to take to the beach. You are wise to bring thermal liquid holders as the drinks melt before you get them back to your beach chair (oh the big problems of vacations!!)The food was very good and we enjoyed the Dominican restaurant and the local fare. I will tell you that we did bring immodium with us and only had to take two tablets on our last night. It certainly didn't ruin our vacation, but it is wise to pack a sleeve or two in case.In closing, a beautiful property with wonderful service in a comfortable setting. My sister and I would recommend the Majestic for your vacation and we certainly wouldn't hesitate to let you know if we felt differently. We appreciate everyone who took the time to help us make our decision and we hope we help out future travellers by writing this review.Hasta la proxima

<Content>Would have been perfect had we not gotten the stomach thing.... Overall, the Majestic is working towards becoming a 5 star. We traveled the week of 2/10-2/17. After reading many reviews we were nervous going down, but the accomadations were great. We had a great room overlooking the pool (Rm 2206) When we were getting ready at night we could enjoy a cocktail on our balcony and listen to the jazz music. We tipped, but still did not receive the champagne, flowers, or animal towels and think that it just depends on your maid. She did the standard-changed our sheets daily, left us clean towels and stocked fridge. We had a plumbing leak when we checked in but they were quick to resolve it the first day and had no other problems ,though we heard many guests complaining about their plumbing issues so we were lucky. The pool was great! by far one of the best pools in the Carribean. There were quiet areas or you could sit near the pool bar side and get more into the entertainment. Much of the cement is coming up, which is too bad for a new resort. We went for many walks onthe beach but did not bother trying to lie out during the day (many days were too windy). Worth the 1 1/2 hour walk to the bartering shops on the beach, it was just fun to see and the art work is great.The Food and Drinks--we think the food was excellent. We had great meals in all the restaurants and we made a point to try them all. Our favorite was the the breakfast buffet, Le Gourmet (make a reservation) and the Japanese (reservation). The drinks were fair, depending on the bartender. They did not use quality alcohol. The only beer they had was Presidente which is similar to Natural Light. The shelf alcohol they use makes it tough to have a rum/coke or gin/tonic. We tried many of their concoctions which helped mask the poor quality of booze. The Majestic sunset became our favorite and some tenders made it on the rocks and others made it as a frozen drink so you never knew what you were going to get. Entertainment--we enjoyed some of the nights. we enjoyed the outdoor pool tables and chess. For the late night, the night club was fun. The Majestic staff was on hand teaching us to Latin dance, try that at midnight after many Majestic Sunset drinks!!The worst part of our trip was getting sick. We had to stay close to our room for an entire day. We were not alone, the couples we had met were in worse shape than us. We got off easy. Driving back to the airport, a full bus of 30+ of us we were comparing stories of who had the intestinal bug the worst. Not sure if it was something going around our resort only, but the Majestic was hit hard that week. We were lucky that we did not have to pay for medical attention (min. $90 for eval. and $150+ for treatment and medications). We will not return to the Dominican any time soon, just for fear of being sick again. The stomach pains were too severe for us to want to relive.If you have a tough stomach lining and want a quiet, restful vacation, this is definately the spot to consider.

<Content>Here are some pointers We just got back from a 2 week stay. We are in our early 30's. The weather was to die for!!We had NO complaints about the resort or the staff. We do two all inclusive trips to the carribean every year. This resort ranks up there with all the other 5 stars we have stayed at throughout the carribean. The staff all know english and understand you, be patient. You have to remember that you are in a different country, different bugs, different foods and so on. It is not home!!! Don't expect home and you will do well.Here are a few tips for travel: If there are no sidewalks, DON'T walk there!!! If there is a line up for food, GO TO THE END!The only complaint we have was the other tourists. We paid good money for a private patio and people didn't care, they stole our chairs, they walked across our lawn, etc. Standing at the buffet people seemed to think they can butt in anywhere.Other than that have an open mind, have a big smile on your face and come out of your shell a bit and you will thouroughly enjoy yourself.

<Content>Great Vacation My husband and I celebrated our 30th anniversary at the Majestic Colonial. It is a beautiful facility; we had an oceanfront suite, and it was worth it. As others have said, the bathroom situation would be awkward for families or individuals traveling together. Our suite was well taken care of by the staff; we left a $2 tip per day and a small item (scented soap, lotion, etc.), and our maid was so grateful. Bugs: If you are bitten by bugs at home, expect the same thing there. No more - no less. Be sure to take your own bug spray; it costs $20 in the gift shop.Food: We were unable to get reservations at the Japanese restaurant, and we checked on it immediately after arrival. We only stayed 4 nights though. Reservations are also required at Le Gourmet. This restaurant was excellent. The breakfast buffets were very good. At almost any time there is some kind of food available and no one should go hungry. If you want snack type foods, I would recommend taking your own. Drinks: We drank the champagne in the mini fridge and were not charged. As stated by some, there is an extra charge for some drinks at the bars. We stayed with the ones included. We took thermal mugs for our drinks to take to the beach; the drinks stayed cold and the sand couldn't blow into the drink.Tourist Card: Upon entering the Dominican Republic at the airport, each person must purchase a $10 tourist card. We paid for the card, were hurried through a line, and returned the card. A quick exchange of cash and card.Money: US dollars were easy to use. The ATM machine in the lobby only gives pesos. We took about $50 in $1's and $50 in $5's. We didn't use them all; but they came in handy for tips as needed. I think a small tip here and there can be very beneficial and appreciated. We booked our vacation package through Sam's Club Travel and couldn't have been more pleased. Toiletries: Take your own face cloth as none are provided. There are small soaps, shampoo (no conditioner), and hair dryers provided. There is also an ironing board and iron.We took a small Spanish dictionary which did come in handy a couple of times.We did the Bavaro Runners excursion. It was alot of fun and worth the money. We took some toys-- coloring books, hair items, balls, etc. for children that we encountered along the way. Our tour guide suggested which children along the way to pass our items to. Such small items brought great enjoyment to these children!  I would definitely return to the Majestic Colonial. The facility is gorgeous with a beach that is unbeatable!

<Content>getting ready for prime time The Majestic Colonial had been open only about 6 weeks when we stayed. (We鈥檝e been to Punta Cana 3 times before, and the DR 6 times.) FOOD Among the best we鈥檝e had. Breakfast is hard to keep interesting, but they had something new every day. RESTAURANTS The dress code (cover-ups required in main room; no bathing suits or short shorts) is enforced. Best of the 7 a la carte was Chinese, which had a huge sushi selection. I did get diarrhea, which I haven鈥檛 had in years, maybe from ice cubes (wife did not). Reservations are not required for most a la carte, which can mean a wait.LAND They were working hard to improve the landscape, planting myriad foliage. Lots of fountains, some not hooked up yet. A sea of lanterns looks dramatic at night.SERVICE Most staff had not taken service English. They did not understand basic requests, and some drink orders went unfulfilled. Also, some food items were not delivered hot. PRIVACY Though the large Punta Cana beach is public, you are not bothered, nor does hotel staff pester. Some toilets lack doors.BEACH As good as any there; kept clean.POOL Very long, spanning the whole hotel. Water temperature comfortable. Some concrete already crumbling.SPORTS Three tennis courts, hardly ever used. They need water and chairs. The one clay court is great, kept up and drying quickly. The two hard courts retain water a long time after rainfall. Activities are not posted.ROOMS Large and well supplied, including mini-bar. Great jacuzzi, large shower. No washcloths, no Do Not Disturb signs. Lamps are low wattage. Pillows inadequate. Air conditioning inadequateQUIET Rooms seem soundproof. However, pool is very noisy with music and activities in afternoon, as is beach in morning.PEOPLE Though a lot of Canadians and Europeans, more US and younger than other resorts.SMOKING Banned in the main dining room (and most a la carte), first time I鈥檝e seen this. There are no signs stating this (in fact, no signs anywhere, even indicating restaurant names), and I saw someone light up and be told it wasn鈥檛 permitted. It is allowed in open-air restaurants near beach.ENTERTAINMENT One of the best. Instead of well-meaning amateur Animation staff, they seem to hire outside professionals (magician, folk dancers). Even lip-synch show (Michael Jackson) had spectacular effects.CASINO Pretty big and lively.TOWEL AND CHAIR SUPPLY Chairs were touch-and-go. Most beach chairs reserved by 10:30, but as the week went on, more pool chairs were moved to the beach, insuring an adequate supply (at least at the latter). Plenty of towels.ISOLATION All major TV networks available. English-language newspapers rare.SHOPPING Resort shops expensive. There鈥檚 a shopping center next door, and stalls 2.5 miles down the beach.

<Content>Majestic has far to go We just returned (Feb 19th) from a one week stay at the Majestic. I won't go into too much detail about the Pool (fantastic)and the beach(beautiful), as they are fully covered below.The Food. Man. The food at the Gourmet and Japanese was pretty good. Not 5-star, but properly cooked and nicely presented. Ingredient quality is not up to N/A standards, but hey, you are not in N/A. HOWEVER... The food at the buffet was mediocre at best. Big problems with tempuratures and questionable handling practices on the raw stuff. Both my girlfriend and I had some stomach issues. It almost seemed that they may not be using properly filtered water to wash fruit and veg, or for the coffee and juice. This is pure speculation, but it seemed to be the case. This might also explain how some people were getting sick, and some not. Different tolerances for minor stomach illnesses. All in all, the food has a LONG way to go before The Majestic Colonial can be considered 4.5-5 star.The Room. Ahh, the room! We were lucky enough to get upgraded to a Colonial Terrace Room (#2350). This had a HUGE top-floor terrace with a large, round, outdoor jacuzzi and a beautifull unobstructed view of the ocean. If you have booked a swim-out room, you will not get the kind of privacy in your out door Jacuzzi that one might like. But, you will have great access to the pool. The swim-out rooms will be a lot better once the vegetation has had 8-10 months to grow in.All in all, we had a decent vacation, and the room made up for alot of shortcomings. We would not go back however, unless the food issues are resolved. We went to the Paradisus Rio de Oro in Cuba in 2005, and for the same price, had *nearly* as nice a suite, and far better food.

<Content>Had a great time at the Majestic Colonial We spent two great weeks at this fine resort from Jan. 26 to Feb. 9/06. I don't know what all the fuss was all about in previous reviews of this place, but things were running very smoothly by the time we got there from Edmonton on the 26th!! The resort is a 5-star, but management will have to continue to repair and upgrade things as time goes on. It was slapped together pretty quickly in order to open on time in mid-December and already there are signs of deterioration in several areas, most notably on the main pool deck, where the surface is crumbling in several places, even where it has previously been patched. The food was terrific in all of the restaurants and if you can't find something good to eat, you are not of sound mind!! There are 6 a la cartes plus the main Buffet and I especially recommend the Japanese teppan where they cook the food in front of you on a large grill. Shrimp, beef, pork, chicken, fish and fried rice and lots of veggies were on the menu and lots of it. There are 3 rooms, each with 10 places and three different sittings per evening. You need a reservation and long pants for men. A reservation and pants are also required for the Gourmet one, and we enjoyed the menu selection there as well. There are 8 bars on the property, however, we found that some drinks, such as coco locos and Majestic Speciales were made differently at each bar, depending on whether or not a blender was available. No watered down drinks, though, and they gladly filled my 52-0z Bubba Keg at all locations!! Waitress service was available near the main pool area, but not at the beach. Depending on where you sat on the beach, it was a fair hike to the bar located in the beach restaurant building. This problem could be solved by buidling a bar right on the beach!! But the use of a thermal mug helps considerably, as the drinks are served in those small plastic cups. The nightly entertainment in the beautiful theatre building was not up to the standards of a 5-star resort. Aside from the usual dance shows (complete with beautiful costumes) and lip-synch singing, there were the usual audience-participation shows, a magic show, karaoke night and the like. The chairs were padded and very comfortable and a table was grouped in with every 3-4 chairs. The sound system was turned up way too loud, especially in our first week and that spoiled things a lot. Note to the tech staff--louder is not always better!! The main pool area is stunning as the pool extends about 1,400 feet from the lobby area down to the beach. Bring a floatie and you can cruise down to the swim-up bar for a refill!! There was never a problem getting a lounger at any time of the day and you didn't have to play the stupid towel game there, unlike at the beach in the second week as the place filled up. Then, you had to be down there before 9 to get a lounger or else go in mid-afternoon when people left the beach area to go elsewhere. As stated in previous reviews, the beach is absolutely gorgeous powdery white sand and you can walk for several kms.in either direction . The water was gentle on most of the days, with very little undertow, and snorkellers even said there lots of fish to see and feed. I noticed very few bugs and mosquitoes and didn't need to use repellant at all. All in all, a very pleasant holiday and I wouldn't hesitate to return or to recommend this resort to anyone. The staff are friendly and efficient and understand basic English. Try a few Spanish words and phrases and you'll be fine. Tipping was not expected but when done was most appreciated. Remember, the staff are not highly paid and anything extra comes in handy. As for excursions, go to the briefing session with your tour rep and see what is available. We did just one trip--that to Higuey for some shopping and cheap rum via taxi with a fellow who friends had used last fall for a trip to Santo Domingo. Very good tour guide and reasonably priced. I can give you his contact info if you wish. If you have any questions, e-mail me at randersn@telusplanet.net

<Content>great relaxing vacation We returned from the majestic last night after a weeks vacation (feb 12 - 19). We enjoyed the resort and all it had to offer. We booked a garden view room but were upgraded to a pool view room on the third floor which also had a great view of the ocean since it was in the last block of rooms, near the beach. The room was great, cleaned well daily, with decorative towels, flowers etc. added. The bar fridge was stocked daily, and there is NO CHARGE for the champagne, we drank 5 bottles throughout the week. The beach was beautiful, they worked hard cleaning it everyday and we had no problem finding chairs. You could walk as far as you wanted in either direction and we saw fish close to the shore.The pool was wonderful, we were able to get chairs in many different sections throughout the week and often had a whole section of the pool to ourselves - there were never many people in it, it was very refreshing.We enjoyed all the food, we ate at the buffet two nights, the steak place, seafood place, japanese, gourmet and dominican/mexican. Two people in our group of six experience stomach problems for one day each, the rest were fine. The lobsters we had at the beach seafood restaurant were huge and delicious. We really enjoyed the japanese restaurant - you need reservations at this and the gourmet one.The people were all very friendly and we did not have any problems with poor service all week.I would return to this resort in the future, and would love to see the grounds once everything matures - they will be spectacular.

<Content>Wonderful Resort - Spectacular Staff My boyfriend and I spent Feb. 5 thru 12 at the Majestic and I was thrilled!We booked about a month before we left, and I requested a pool view room, king size bed. Our room (2250) was perfectly located. It was last room before the suites at the beach end of the resort, on the second floor. We had both a pool and an ocean view. Privacy on our balcony, but close to the beach, the pool bar, and the beach resturant. The room itself was lovely. We were welcomed with a fruit plate, champagne, and a stocked mini-fridge, with soda, beer, water and chocolates. Neither of us drinks champagne, so I don't know if they charge you for drinking it, but we drank the beer and were never charged. They restock the fridge every day, including the excellent coffee, which I made in the mini coffee maker every morning.The room was very clean, although maintenance was iffy. (Maybe they're concentrating on finishing up construction.) We didn't request maintenance, so I can't be sure. But, our toilet ran after being flushed (we fixed this ourselves), the toilet seat bolts were loose so the seat kept dropping (we tried to fix this, but the bolts were stripped) and the shower drain seemed to have a mind of its own - just when I thought it was clogged, and the water was about to spill out, it would start draining.The food was OK - my biggest complaint at the buffets was that the food wasn't hot. Breakfast buffet had everything you could possbily want, but the pre-cooked food is kept warm under heat lamps, not steam tables, so it's barely warm when you get it, and room temperature when you get back to your table. But, overall the quality is good, and there is more than enough variety for everyone. Drinks are good - don't miss the dirty monkey at the pool bar. We didn't drink the water, but used it to brush our teeth, and had no problems at all.The staff (with the partial exception of the front desk) are the nicest, most friendly people I've ever met. A couple of examples: while at breakfast I dropped some food on my shorts and stopped at the nearest bathroom to try get out the stain. This bathroom didn't have paper towels (only real towels) so I tried to use toilet paper. The maid in the bathroom saw me, grabbed a towel, soaped it, and got on her knees to scrub the stain out of my shorts (can you belive this?). Ernesto at the pool bar noticed that my boyfriend was up early and going to the other end of the resort for coffee. He started putting on the coffee early at the pool bar, just for my boyfriend. The language barrier exists, but I could always manage to communicate my request and the staff was incredibly gracious in granting it.The entertainers are fantastic - the camp counselors I called them. The're fun, funny, and talented. Don't miss the afternoon high-jinks at the pool and learn to do the house dance - the Taki-Taki.Extra-special thanks to Jose from Coco Tours and his buddy (Modesto, I think) who went out of their way for us. Jose cashed travlers checks for me (in dollars at full value) and when our flight out was cancelled due to the blizzard in New England, Jose was on his day off and Modesto took care of us, even though we weren't with his group.A few hints - we brought lots of singles and tipped with them. It was a small amount to us, but so greatly appreciated by the staff. Don't bring Travelers' checks. If they can cash them at all at the front desk, you'll get Domincan pesos and will loose money when you try to change back to dollars. And, on-site it's 30 pesos to the dollar, off site it's about 35. The in-room safe is fine for cash.The on-site shops are outrageously priced. Walk down to the plaza just outside the resort, or take a cab to Plaza Bavaro for souvineers. Expect to be hounded a bit (just say No, gracias) and definitely bargain. You can get some great deals on the larimar jewelery.Communication to the U.S. is tough. The resort charges $2 for every outside call, plus something like $3 per minute to the U.S. If you need to call home, talk to your cell phone provider well before you leave. My cell phone (Cingular) worked very well.If you play black-jack, be careful. They use 8 decks (to our 6 decks) so that changes the odds a bit.Take a late night swim in the pool. I went for a dip at about 11:00 one night and had the whole pool to myself.Overall, the Majestic is fabulous! I'd go back again tomorrow!

<Content>Worst Vacation Ever My boyfriend and I have stayed at numerous all inclusive resorts throughout the Caribbean and the Majestic Colonial Punta Cana was by far the worst ever. We both became violently ill during our vacation; him with a bacterial ear infection and myself with chronic vomiting and diarrhea. As a result we both required medical care from the on staff doctor and wound up with a $1000.00 medical bill. The food was horrible; the steak was always raw and as tough as a shoe, the seafood tasted bad, and the buffet was always cold. The alcohol was not premium as a result you were served the cheap stuff. The bartenders could not mix a good drink and the service was fair at best. They also do not offer room service nor do they allow you to bring food back to your room. The staff has no knowledge of the English language if you do not speak Spanish you are out of luck. Also I understand that it is a family resort but there are small children everywhere especially jumping in the pool when you are trying to relax. The Majestic is definitely not a five star resort as it is a three star at best.

<Content>STUNNING RESORT STUNNING is my favourite word to describe this place. I am having a hard time trying to understand the complaints that people are having with the Majestic - Food was terrific !!! The pool awesome !!! The ocean, magnificent !!!......was there a language barrier? sure was, but I tried to speak Spanish, they tried to speak English and our requests were understood. Were there bugs? Of course there were - it's the Caribbean isn't it? Was there work going on? Sure was - but in no way was it noisy or bothersome. Were the drinks good? A definite yes. We had a marvellous time here and couldn't even begin to describe our vacation. Everything was wonderful, and yes we had a few problems but hardly anything worth writing about. I even spent a day in bed being sick. But surely, I can't blame the resort or it's food can I? The staff were so accommodating that when we required something it came quickly and with a huge smile - tipping was never expected but made us feel good to tip here and there. We felt the resort and it's staff strived to make everyone happy and worked hard at appeasing everyone even though we know there is just no pleasing some people. As for the beach, we couldn't find chairs many times, however the workers (green uniforms) were more than happy to find chairs for us (8 chairs needed for our group). We loved the beach area and preferred it over the pool, although we spent some time in the pool and loved every minute of it. There is so much more to write about, but I think you get the jest of what our vacation was all about. Was it perfect? nope but darn close. Our hats off to Sunquest's rep, Mike Bryant - he was extremely helpful, a pleasure to meet and made for a great dinner partner. Thanks again Mike!!!! And LeapingLeo.....she's still there and last I saw of her, she was having fun,fun and more fun. Great meeting you Leo !!!!!(what a fluke to meet her on the beach one day....just starting talking and remembered each other posts here). Anyways, any questions don't hesitate to e-mail me.....selectivedi@yahoo.ca..............

<Content>One of the best resorts anywhrere in the Carribean My name is George. I stayed at this resort with my family and 4 other relatives from Jann 31 to Feb 15, 2006. I've travelled to the Carribean over 20 times to many different 4 and 5 star resorts and I have to say this is one of my 2 FAVOURITE resorts. The other was the Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana.  I read some of the earlier reviews especially the negative ones and I have to say that these people do not know what they are talking about. They obviously never travelled before or are just to hard to please.   I will give you a summary of the resort: ROOMS: Very large with a king bed or 2 double beds. We also had 2 children and the hotel put in 2 extra beds in our room which fit no problem. We still had ample space. The shower was huge, the toilet room was a little samll. There was also a bath tub in the centre of the room. There was a living room with a sofa and an office desk. The TV was good. We caught over 30 channels. GROUNDS: The grounds were SPECTACULAR and getting better every day. The lobby was by far the MOST BEAUTIFUL and GRAND that I have ever seen anywhere in the Caribbean. POOL: Just gorgeous. Very large. It spanned the length of the resort. beautful architecture throughout. One of the most beautiful pools anywhere. BEACH: The beach in Punta Cana is one of the most spectacular in the world. White powder sand and gorgeous turquoise water. There was also beautiful little angel fish and sometimes little colourful swordfish like looking fish that would come up to you if you fed them bread and bananas. There was also good snorkelling just about 200 metres in from the beach which had a variety of different fish. FOOD: For the Carribean, the food was excellent. There was always lots of variety. The A LA CARTE restaurants were good, especially the JAPANESE restaurant. We stayed mainly to the buffet restaurant at we found it always good with lots of variety especially at lunch since the beach grill was not that good. One recommendation I have is to bring mosquito repellant as there are a lot of mosquitoes at night. OVERALL: THIS IS DEFINITELY A TRUE FIVE STAR. ONE OF THE BEST ANYWHERE. I WOULD DEFINITELY GO BACK IN A HEARTBEAT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.

<Content>Absolutely beautiful...would definitely go back We just returned from the Majestic Colonial Feb. 11/06. I can't figure out what other people are talking about. My husband and I had an absolutely fantastic experience and will definitely go back. Everything was beautiful. The resort, the rooms, the people that worked there etc. There is nothing more we could have asked for and that was our fourth trip to Punta Cana and by far the nicest place we have stayed. The food was amazing,there is something for everyone. The rooms are definitely more geared towards couples which was exactly what we wanted. The shower was incredible and we had hot water morning, noon and night. We had our fridge stocked everynight and hardly touched it. You should of course try to book your meals that require reservations as soon as you get there. We had no problems getting into any restaurant. There were plenty of areas at the pool depending whether you wanted to get involved in the games or you just wanted quiet relaxing time. There were bars everywhere you went. There was a beautiful coffee garden/beer garden that was open from morning to night. At night there was a saxaphone and piano player that was very nice. The theatre was huge and more than enough seating. Everything was open and running and the pool area was absolutely immaculate. The only problem we noticed was other tourists being rude and leaving their kids unsupervised. There are no lifeguards and no supervision around that is why there is a kids club. People need to watch their own children when they go on vacation. WE absolutely loved the Majestic and will recommend this resort to anyone. Go and experience it for yourself, relax and have a great time. We never had the electricity or hot water go out on us. We met many other couples that absolutely loved it and will go back as well. Have fun.

<Content>IT WAS OK - Not the greatest vacation, but not bad considering! The resort overall was average. It has the potential to be great, but for now, it was just incomplete. Our room was beautiful, but on the fourth floor with a non operating elevator. Getting up there was a problem especially being with our friends that had a baby stroller to get up there. The room was spacious and beautiful though and it overlooked the pool which is also beautiful. The beach was also great! The grounds though were not completed... staff was working every day ... speaking of which, did not speak English. Very little. This became a problem. Everyone expects a little language barrier when you travel but not to this extent. The food was also average. The best restaurants were the French Gourmet and the Japanese. I would say that overall it's not a bad place to stay, but there are many better ones in Punta Cana.

<Content>We'll be back next year :-) We just returned back from a week at the Majestic early this morning. We had a great time!General layout - resort is a good size. We had a central room (2114) and could walk anywhere in 5 minutes or less. Landscaping has some growing to do, but will be great by this time next year. Nice common areas, with beautiful decor and very comfortable seating. Loved the ambient music... both canned, and the piano and sax players :-) Room - Just my husband and I, so we were OK with the open bathroom concept, and liked being able to see the TV from the tub, but I can see how it would be difficult for non-couples, or those with children in the same room. Our room was great. Clean and bright. We had one of the 1st floor swim-out rooms with the outdoor jacuzzi. After experiencing the convenience of this, I don't think we would be able to settle for just one of the regular rooms! We definitely made use of the jacuzzi :-)I will agree with the comments on the bad pillows. SO thin.. like airline pillows! And they only put two on the bed by default. We asked for two extras, but still thin even then. I think you'll want 6 to be fair.Never had any problems with AC... you could have it as freezing as you like :-)Maid - service was good... not too early. Usually came while we were at breakfast. No towel art, but we did get flowers :-) Couple of little quirks... we left one of our robes on the side of the tub and it was taken with the towels, and we never did get a replacement! Just one robe between us for the rest of the week. Same with our bedspread... something was spilled on it, so instead of making up the bed with another, they just took it away! Oh well... nothing serious :-)Food  Drink - was excellent! We were expecting beef to be not so good, from some of the comments, but it was great! The sirloin at the beach restaurant was great, and the filet at Le Gourmet was even better :-) The grilled lobster at the beach was so-so... again, Le Gourmet lobster tail was better :-) We tried every single restaurant, and enjoyed them all, but Le Gourmet was the best one. The buffets are also pretty good as buffet's go :-) Large, with lots of choice. Can honestly say we only encountered flies one day... and that was at our table, not in the buffet itself.Will agree that the house wine isn't all that great... but it seems that not every bar uses the same. Some reds are darker/better than others. The lobby bar actually has a few different ones that you can get as house. Daquiri's are also best at the lobby bar... slushy, and not just mix on ice cubes. Pool - is gorgeous :-) No deep areas but that's fine with us. The swim out room made it very easy to go for a quick dip... and we had our own lounge chairs, so no need to scout for a good spot. Not sure if the pool is supposed to close at a certain time, but we occassionally jumped in for a swim as late as midnight, and never got in any trouble for it :-) Beach is also beautiful, and never a problem finding chairs, any time of day. Waiter service on the beach would've been a nice touch though... not great having to walk up to the steakhouse bar.We only had one 'technical difficulty' with our stay... twice our room lost power totally! And both times, when they reset it, the TV and mini-bar power didn't come back, and had to be worked on more extensively. An inconvenience to be sure, but both times they sent someone to fix it within minutes, and we just hung out on the patio to catch some more sun :-) Not sure if this was a problem specifically with our room or not??Overall we greatly enjoyed our stay. We plan to go back next year, with friends, for two weeks this time!!

<Content>great vacation! We just returned Feb. 2nd after a wonderful week at the Majestic Colonial! Like mentioned by other visitors, the rooms are very spacious and clean! The bugs (mosquitoes are not bad at all as they spray every evening!) There is a new little shopping plaza at the entrance to the driveway leading up to the Majestic and be prepared to barter for everything and you will get awesome deals! There is also a little shopping plaza on site but you will pay high prices for things like suntan lotion and batteries. Go with an open mind and you will have a great time! The Japanese restaurant provided great entertainment and food, and you get to meet 8 guests and have a great time! There are no facecloths on the premises and the nightly entertainment needs some fine tuning, but otherwise everything else was great! The atm machine is still not working so bring cash with you. I am sure you will have an enjoyable vacation, if you expect a 4 star hotel and not a 5 star (which it will be in another year or two I'm sure)!!

<Content>AWESOME TIME @ THE MAJESTIC COLONIAL We stayed at the Majectic Colonial Punta Cana from Jan. 13 TO JAN, 20--2006.This was our third vacation to Punta Cana, and it was our best. The lobby was impressive, and check-in and check-out went very smooth, they spoke relatively good english. Our room was very spacious and clean. The only problem that some people may have is the bathroom/toilet situation. The only thing between you and any one else is a frosted glass door that does not go all the way to the ceiling. The same thing goes for the shower. So unfortunately there is not alot of privacy if you are with people other than your spouse. There is a huge mirror in front of two sinks with a smaller make-up mirror for the ladies. With no other room to go into for privacy, this is where we changed and got ready to go out. This did not bother us but I could see it being a pain with kids or other family members. The food there was FANTASTIC!!! We were impressed at the variety of food that was offered to us. We tried every restaurant and were happy with them all. The one thing that has to be fixed is the burgers at the beach restaurant. They were never cooked all the way through-always raw, so don't eat those unless they cook it for alot longer. No one should go hungry at this resort. I think there is something for everyone. There was the odd fly or two in the main buffet, but with the sheer size of the area to dine, it will take time to get them all. The beach area was pretty clean, but there was the rare piece of glass so just watch your step. We never had to look very hard to get a beach lounger. There seemed to be plenty to go around. We saw tonnes of fish swimming right off of shore at low tide, around 5:00 pm. We even had angel fish eating bread right out of our hand.  We found the staff to be very courtious and helpfull. They all did not speak English, but with the odd word or two in Spanish, and some hand gestures we usually could figure each other out. Our room was always cleaned on time and our mini-fridge was always stocked on a daily basis. The pool is massive and was never too cold. Myself and some people I met were in there one afternoon, and two staff came to us in a kayak and offered us some mama juana. I thought that was pretty cool. The grounds have a little way to go yet as the plants are still immature and the sod needs to grow and be evened out a bit. I'm sure that in a year or two the grass and flowers will be healthy and blooming. Overall, I would reccomend this resort to any one. Our experience there was great, and we met some awesome people there who I am sure will be friends for years to come.

<Content>Enjoyed the Majestic!!! We stayed at the Majestic from 1/22 to 1/29. I鈥檒l qualify this review by telling you that we have been going to all-inclusives for over 20 years鈥nd never the same one twice! There are three things that are most important when going to an all-inclusive鈥?: a functioning room 2: a great beach and 3: good food. The Majestic satisfied all three.The room鈥e had a 2nd floor room that overlooked the 鈥榩arking lot鈥?of the other resort. This didn鈥檛 concern us because we spent very little time in the room. Your first impression when entering the room is 鈥渨ow鈥? It is very large with lots of marble. Then you notice that this is an 鈥渙pen floor plan鈥? The bathroom is open to the entire room. There is NO privacy. If this is an issue for you鈥nd you have not booked your trip yet, I would not recommend this resort. It was not an issue for us. Beds are hard and pillows are thin. The phones are not functioning properly. They are cross-connected incorrectly, so that if you are calling the room next door鈥ou鈥檒l probably get somebody else鈥檚 room! The rooms are cleaned everyday鈥ou just don鈥檛 know when鈥ould be anytime of day. They didn鈥檛 clean the room one day. We were satisfied with the room鈥?slept well and no major problems.The beach/pool鈥unta Cana鈥檚 beach is beautiful. You can walk for miles and miles. The water is warm and clear. The beach area is nice with lots of chairs and shady areas. The pool is the largest pool we have ever seen. It is designed as a meandering river. Beautiful.The food鈥e ate at the buffets most of the time. Breakfast was very good. The lunch buffet at the beach was better than most we have experienced. Dinner was very good also. We only ate at one restaurant鈥he Steak one鈥e were very disappointed. From a buffet perspective, the food served was exceptional.As others have suggested, bring all the things that you need鈥he stores are outrageous鈥S$26 for suntan lotion! Language issues鈥olks, this is a foreign country!!! They speak Spanish! They try very hard to communicate with you. You need to make an effort also. We had no problems telling them what we wanted. They are gracious and very friendly. Don鈥檛 be an Ugly American.Entertainment鈥he nightly entertainment was typical of these resorts. Lots of dancing and loud music. Recommend that you see the Michael Jackson show鈥he best one! Activities鈥?there are some activities that start at 3PM near the pool. We watched a few times, but didn鈥檛 join in.Grounds鈥?as all know, this is a new resort. The landscaping is incomplete and immature. It will be beautiful when it is complete.If what you want to do is have a laid-back vacation鈥hen this resort will work for you. We enjoyed the beach鈥te all the food we wanted鈥nd had all the drinks we desired. NOTE: if you order top shelf liquor there is an additional charge. Just stick with the basics.Ultimately, your vacation will depend on your attitude. If you are looking for something to be wrong, you will find it. Just remember the three most important things鈥nd you鈥檒l have a great time!!

<Content>On the right track... Jan 2-8, 2006We chose the Majestic Colonial based on some of the reviews that compared it to Secrets Excellence resorts which is our benchmark for comparison after a vacation there last year. We took into consideration the reviews that mentioned the resort was a mere weeks old so we were prepared for the constant landscaping going on around us. The GoodBeach - The beach was one of the best we've seen. So if the beach is what you're looking for in a sun vacation, then this alone is a reason to choose this resort. We didn't even go near the pool which was huge and looked great because the beach was so inviting. The key complaint is that they don't take drink orders on the beach.Room - The room was very similar to Secrets Excellence (Mayan Riviera) and lived up to my expectations. The mini-bar was fully stocked every day and room service was regular as it should be. Granted, some of the finishing touches looked rushed (paint spots, caulking globs)The BadFood - The food was definitely sub-par. The buffets had variety, but the quality was not great. The a la carte restaurants were actually worse than the buffets and and the service was so slow at the Asian restaurant that we left midway through because we were hungry. The beachside grill had tiny lobsters that usually wasn't fully cooked. Aside from upgrading the food quality, they should add room service and some food options between the main meal times. One day, we missed the 10.30 breakfast and had to wait 2 hrs for lunch. Mosquitos - We definitely got beaten by the mosquitos every night in our room. My evening ritual was to kill the elusive mosquitos with the free slippers before bedtime.Overall, we came here for a great beach and a good room which is what we got. Better food would have given this a perfect rating.

<Content>A perfectly restful vacation! My husband and I (both 25 and from Massachusetts) stayed at the Majestic Colonial from Jan 20-27. One of his coworkers (who is a travel agent) talked him into setting up our vacation with this resort, and I am glad he did!The goal of our vacation was to get away from the craziness of the working world and truly relax. We did not want to go on any outside excursions or go crazy with keeping to any kind of schedule. All we wanted to do was spend time by the pool reading a book or going for long walks on the beach. This will help you understand my review a bit better.The Majestic Colonial and its staff was more than I could ask for. Every staff member you walked by would greet you with a smile and say Hola!. Staff members in the restaraunts would go out of their way to try and assist with whatever you wanted. Many of them spoke some English, and when they did not understand what you were saying, they would try hand gestures or other ways to communicate. They really appreciated the tourists using some basic Spanish words and phrases, and would teach you new ones if you wished. The food was abundant and delicious! I will never forget the sugared donuts in the breakfast buffet and the chocolate cake at the steakhouse. The French restaraunt was spectacular with its service and meals rich with flavors. My husband was ready to eat steak almost all week long, and he was not disappointed. The grounds were very nice, with workmen planting new plants daily. Early in the morning you could see several men cleaning the huge swimming pool, and during the day there were men picking up any trash on the beach. Once all of the plants take root and flourish and all of the fountains are running, the grounds will be spectacular. We went for several walks on the beach. By taking a right after the Majestic Colonial beach area, you can walk by many other resorts and encounter a shopping area after about a 45 minute walk. But by taking a left, you will quickly encounter beach that has not yet been developed and is very quiet and peaceful. My husband and I spent hours one day sitting on this quiet portion of the beach with only a couple people walking by. But since the area is undeveloped, there is no one to pick up the trash that washes up or blows up onto the beach.We also spent a lot of time by the piano bar where they have numerous sitting areas with cozy couches and chairs. By giving one of the bar workers a tip here and there, you were ensured frequent refills of your cervesas and vino without leaving your seat. The room we had was on the second floor and overlooked the swim-up bar. I agree with other guests responses about the bathroom set-up and its lack of privacy, but we worked around it with turning on the TV or the Jacuzzi tub. It was a real treat to sit in the tub and watch a movie on TV. The maid did a wonderful job keeping our room clean, and seemed to know when we would not be in the room for her to come by. Our fridge was always restocked daily. There is a safe in the room with an electronic keypad that you can enter your own code. This way we were sure our passports and plane tickets home would be safe. The TV does carry many English channels, including ESPN in both English and Spanish. We only made it to one of the shows during our stay, and there were many people there. We left early because the speakers were blasting the music uncomfortably loud. Recommendations I would make to others planning to come to the Majestic Colonial:* Bring everything you need in regards to sunscreen, bar soap, shampoo, film, medications, etc because it is very expensive. If you use face cloths or tissues, bring those as well as they are not supplied. * Come with a positive attitude, and you will enjoy your stay that much more. It is a new resort and the employees are still learning their way. And remember that the food will be different than at home-- this is a Spanish country.* Bring $1 bills for tipping. A tip here and there will have the workers going the extra mile for you. * If you like to snack during the day, make sure to bring some of your own. Sitting by the pool with a drink and nothing to snack on was a small disappointment. * If you enjoy floating on rafts in the pool or the ocean, bring some with you as the resort does not have any. * Also bring more reading material than you think you will go through during your vacation. My husband finished his two books in three days and refused to pick up one of my books.I hope my review helps others realize what a wonderful resort the Majestic Colonial is now, and what it may become in the next few months. For those looking for the type of vacation we sought, it was perfect-- by our third night there I had forgotten what day of the week it was!

<Content>Amazing My family (husband and 2 kids, 7  4 yrs) were joined by my sisters and nieces from the USA on Jan 17-24.We had an amazing time. The resort is hands down one of the best. I have been to the RIU Bachata, Marien Coral by Hilton and Beaches in Cuba and these are all 41/2  5 stars. The Majestic is difinately on par to a 5 star. The food is the best I have encountered (you may not like some of the items but with 8 resturants and many choices you can always find something to your liking. In any trip you take you will always encounter some minor issues. Here are a few that occured and how I dealth with it.-Language...it flored me that people complained about the staff not speaking English. If Pedro did not understand me I asked Jose and he did.-Entertainment...loved the International Dance show an Michael Jackson show. We did not pay for a Vagas show so don't expect all the shows to be great. The disco was always fun.-Bugs...yes but there are 3 other major resorts along side and the bugs are not only at the Majestic. If you bath in perfume ...yes the bugs will be attracted to you.-Construction...some work being done but NOT noticable or a bother, no loud noise etc.-Rooms....amazing.-Shops...most of the shops are open and yes it is expensive for most items (it is like that everywhere) walk with the items you need sunblock etc(it is part of planning your trip).Your vacation is what you make out of it. You have the choice to whine and complain about minor things or go prepared and be realistic and have a great time....we did and loved it.

<Content>Majestic Colonial - A wonderful experience! My husband and I just returned from 2 weeks at the Majestic (Jan 6 鈥?20). After reading some reviews prior to our departure we were quite concerned, but determined not to let anything spoil our vacation. As it turned out, we worried for nothing. Our experience at the Majestic was a wonderful one!-Check in was a breeze. Even at 4am (Sunwing鈥檚 flight times are awful), the hotel had 5 employees at the reception ready and waiting for the 20 or so people that arrived. The lobby has two levels and is very beautifully decorated. The piano bar now has a piano (in case you were wondering).-Our room was clean and spacious. There were no facecloths, but this being our 4th trip to the DR, we know that there rarely are, so we had brought our own. It is true that the toilet stall is not floor to ceiling and therefore has limited privacy. This was not an issue for us, but may be for others. As for the air conditioning, it was activated only by motion in the room, which was slightly annoying when you were sitting still watching tv (it would turn off) or when you shifted in bed in the middle of the night (it would turn on). We actually got used to this, however the last 5 days of our stay, the AC was on constantly so we suspect the hotel received complaints and responded to them by adjusting it. -A tip regarding making calls. We thought we would not be charged if we used a calling card to call Canada but the operator at the hotel asked us for the name of the calling card (it was a World Calling Card) and connected us to them and then charged for the connection cost (50 pesos each time). Just ask the operator for an outside line instead and you should be ok.-Seven shops were open on Caribbean Street. The prices are hotel prices. For example, Pringles will cost you approximately $8 US. Sunscreen is $14 US and up. We discovered the Playa Blanca market just outside the resort. Just walk out of the lobby, down the hotel entrance road and it鈥檚 on the right (only a 5-7 minute walk). Also, once a week, vendors come on site and set up tables near the Theatre. Remember, you have to bargain at the market and with the vendors! They will overcharge you just like the hotel, if you let them.-We recommend venturing outside the resort for at least one excursion. This is the only way you鈥檒l get to see the real Dominican Republic. We enjoyed the Marinarium (http://www.marinarium.com) and ATV excursions. You should be able to book with your on site tour rep.-The gardens WILL be beautiful. At the moment everything is newly planted, but in a few months it will be spectacular.-The beach was beautiful and we never had trouble getting a palpa or chairs, though we suspect this may change when the hotel is at full capacity. We did find the water to be very wavy, but still happily swam in it!-The pool goes from one end of the resort to the other. We enjoyed a swim every day and it never felt crowded. -We were very pleased with the food. I am a picky eater and I certainly did not starve. The only restaurant we had to make a reservation for was the Japanese. I鈥檓 not sure if this will change eventually. Most resorts require reservations at any a la carte restaurants鈥?br/>-We only went to a couple of the nightly shows. The Michael Jackson impersonator is definitely worth checking out. We were thoroughly entertained!-The staff was very helpful and friendly. We found that learning a few key words and phrases in Spanish was helpful to us and appreciated by the staff. We ran into occasional language barriers but found that most of the staff spoke some English. These people are some of the most hardworking people you will ever meet. The wait staff begins working long before we roll out of bed. They work through breakfast, lunch and dinner. They work 16 hour days, for 13 days straight and then have 3 days off. They鈥檝e earned our respect and our patience. We were shocked and embarrassed at the way some guests treated the staff鈥?br/>To summarize, we were very impressed with the state of the hotel considering it had been open for only a month. We saw little improvements every day. We feel that we definitely got our money鈥檚 worth.

<Content>great vacation We just came yesterday from the Majestic. I was, like a lot of other reviewers, a bit apprehensive about it. But we had a beautiful vacation in the end. Let's start with the good:Food was excellent! We've been to Punta Cana 5 times and this was the best food we ever had.Staff was extremely friendly and made a genuine effort to help. So what if sometimes screwed up and brought you the wrong drinks - they were back with the correct ones in less than 30 seconds! Rooms were bigger than any other hotel we've seen (including the neighbouring Grand Paradiso and Breezes, where I took a peek)Buildings and grounds were, well,..majestic! (give the grass and flowers time to get established!)Spa, gym and casino were opened.Maybe we got lucky, but we had none of the crowds we encountered at other hotels. It was a pleasure not to have to wake up at 5:00 a.m. to reserve a chair on the beach or to rub elbows with the neighbours in the restaurants. And, exept for the japanese one, we didn't have to reserve at any of the a la carte restaurants which, by the way, were all open.Now the bad:It is clear that they opened too soon - work still going on (although not that annoying). But things are improving fast - they opened the remaining rooms while we were there.Stores are not all opened and those who are don't have much and are awfully expensive.Cleaning staff need more training - the rooms were clean, but the little details expected from a 5 star hotel are not there yet (sometimes they forgot to bring all the towels or to empty the garbage can in the toilet).The shower-toilet combination are a result of an over eager architect. Completely impractical! As much as I love my spouse of 25 years, I still appreciate some privacy when using the toilet. Not to speak of the smell that penetrates into the room, the toilet not being closed at the top and bottom. The shower is huge, but I would have settled for a smaller one that drains well.We had to call three times until the air conditioning was finally fixed.Here you have it! If you are willing to overlook minor defficiencies (after all, you're on vacation, so relax!)you'll have a great time. The important thing is that they are obviously trying to improve every day and will eventually succeed. At the rate they're going, I do believe they will reach the 5 star status by the end of the year.And don't forget - a couple of tips here and there will definetely give you a better service!

<Content>No need to worry We booked our vacation in mid December just before they opened, then we started reading the reviews as they trickled in. We were so worried about having a terrible time that we tried to have our travel agency switch us to another resort. Lucky for us it was cost prohibitive for us change. We decided to stay with the Majestic! We went armed with all types of mosquito repellents and bug sprays, also we had envisioned construction debris and broken glass everywhere. Whoever wrote those reviews couldn't have come to this resort!(bugs and mosquitos were almost nonexistent) This place is absolutely beautiful!!!!! Check in only took five minutes. We were pool side in 15 minutes with a drink in hand. The only restaurant that requires a reservation is the Japanese, there is also a French restaurant, a Mexican restaurant and the Beach side restaurant, and finally a Buffet restaurant. Long pants are required for men in the Japanese and the French restaurants, also take note, that infants are not allowed in the French restaurant. The staff were all friendly, and helpful. We went expecting the worst and got the best, if you are contemplating coming to this resort do it soon because this place is going to cost a lot more this time next year!

<Content>May Be Outstanding in 2 Yrs I will give the good news first. This place was without a doubt very beautiful and majestic as the name proclaims, and in 2 - 3 years when they finish all the fine details I am certain it will be MAJESTIC. The staff were all trying so hard to make every customer happy, I will never forget there smiles and willingness to try to figure out what the heck I was asking for since all I could speak was English. Many of the services were not available or open that were advertised. I.E. Spa, gym. Piano Bar, had no piano!!! Restarant hrs were not consistant. When the Spa did open I made an appointment for the first available time which was 3 pm next day. When I showed up for this appt 15 min before the booked time I had to wait 30 more Min till the receptionist informed me that the massage therapist could not be located and was asked if I would like to re-book. We lost all hydor/electricty which took 4 hours and 3 calls to have restored, meanwhile there was water leaking thru the ceiling in the shower, and the water would not drain out of the shower, and at least 2 inches always remained. It took 5 hours to get 2 beers for the mini bar, no face clothes were available only various sized towels, a surprise each day as to how many would be left. There was always a bad stench of garbage by the Ice machines, since this seemed to be a shaded area where the cleaning staff would leave garbage for long periods of time. There was only 1 shop open after about 4 days and it was very over priced.We did have a great vacation inspite of the short comings, but when you pay double the price for the week of Christmas you want everything to be perfect, and for us the people that provided the pool side entertainment such as, Louis and Antonio. They were the best part of every day with all their enthusiasm. Once again I want to mention how great the smiles were on all the personal as they tried to get thru all the trials of this Resort opening up too early.

<Content>How can I say...Majestic !! We just got back from Majestic Colonial on January 10th. We ( 4 adults and one child )where there for one week in their third week of operation and we where amaze of the beauty of this complex. It is true that some construction is going on, but it is only at one part of the hotel and to be honest, when you are at the beach, pool, or restaurants you don't hear a thing. You will be astonish when you get in the looby, it is huge and very very taken cared of. There is two bars, one in the upper level wich is the piano bar even though there is no piano, the other one is at ground level and is very nice too. The cuba libre, santo libre and draft beer are excellent at all the bars (6) and are the drinks are recommend.I can understand why previous travellers said that even the staff where lost when looking for their rooms, the room numbers have 4 digits, here's how it works...-The first digit tells wich aisle your room will be, if it is 1 or 4, you'll be facing the exterior of the resort, if it is 2 or 3, you'll be facing the interior ( the bests are 2 or 3 as you'll face the pool wich is 400 meters long.....);-The second digit tells your floor, 1-2-3 or 4th floor;-The last two is your room and the higher is the tow last digits, the closer you'll be to the ocean and further away from lobby, reception, buffet.By the way, they are not aligned, meaning that if your walking ground level and see room number 2134, dont expect to have 2434 in the same building as not all buildings have 4 floors.The Bavaro beach in Punta Cana is amazing, super soft white sand and blue water, calm breeze in January.....that says alote. I went for the helicopter tour, 1/2 hour, I got to see all Macao beach, Bavaro beach, and both are amazing. Flying at 200 Km/h 10 feet above see level, coast line is an experience a recommend to everybody. I saw images that will stay forever embedded in my mind. An helicopter tour in the Caribean (coast line) is'nt the same than one in Ottawa above the parliement I can tell you that..........The rooms are very nice, a working jacuzzi, fridge, large balcony, the nicest shower I've been in (all in marble), the toilet lacks of privacy, TV ( bring 2 AAA batteries for the remote controller if you wish to watch TV before going to bed but I'm sure that if you asked the reception, they will give you batteries) The fridge gets filled every afternoon with 2 pepsi, 1 7up, 1 orange crush, 2 bottle of agua, 2 chocolat bars. Their is also one bottle of champagne and one bottle of whisky, I don't know if they give new ones if you drink them all as we did'nt took that opportunaty :). Beds are confortable (their new !!) but the pillows could be better.The Gym, Casino, Discotheque, theatre where all nice two. The seating at the theatre was the comfortiest seat I've sat in for a show. The set of two chairs plus a table cost like 800$ canadian and there is like 250 of them !!!. The Micheal Jackson show was amazing, for a moment I really thought it was the real Micheal Jackson as we all know how weird the guy is and that he could have decided to produced himself in Punta Cana.......a few santo libre help my thinking that evening too :)))The food was excellent, we went at Gourmet, Oriental, Caribbean and Grill. It was confusing on the restaurants part as they advertise 5 A la carte, but we manage to find only 4 and the fourth one is like the buffet by the beach. Anyway, it was confusing but we can't say anything about the food as it was incredible.The animation could have been better even thought the animation staff works their butt of every day (keep in mind that we were there in their theird week of operation).I'll finish by saying that this complexe will be ......Majestic in a year or two. I can't understand why people would complaint about the vegetation, the little noise with construction, patch work for the grass. You'r in the Caribean, instead go enjoye the beautiful beach, the amazing 400 meters long pool and relax, cause the next thing you'll find out is that your going back home tomorrow. See you next year Punta Cana !!!!!

<Content>Simply put...it was fine 2 families stayed from January 8th to the 15th.4 adults and 4 kids ages 10 to 14.The place is very good and will be excellent soon. Remember, it is still in the start up phase. Most people spoke english and were very helpful. The best food by far is in Le Gourmet. The buffets are OK and there is always plenty of food. The beach is great and the pool is awesome. Entertainment is just OK. The Michael Jackson night is very good. We met a lot of people from places like Kansas City, many Bostonians, and a German couple. Our room was awesome. The colonial junior suites are not yet ready so you will be upgraded to a swim out room. These are (in my opinion) the best rooms. Ours was directly across from the swim up bar. It was great for the kids as they could go from the pool to the room with ease. The layout of the place is not as good as it could be but a day or two of getting used to it is all you need.A lot of things are still not ready such as:stores, kids center, jacuzzis and the lighting. It seems that they have a lot of electrical problems. Lights out on walkways and bridges. The fountains work somedays and not others. Once they work these bugs out it should be nice.They only serve Presidente beer unless you want to pay extra and the alcohol is classico brand and the others are extra too. The bugs were not bad at all. Bring everything you need such as meds, sunblock, lotions, bug spray as the only store that carries it is very expensive.Daily activities are not yet where they should be. They have daily pool aerobics, and volleyball but the participation is very minimal. They need to beef it up a lot to get people interested.All in all, the place is very good and it will live up to your expectations as long as you can look past the minor stuff.Happy vacation.

<Content>Majestic Colonial- the place is great! This is to calm the fears of anyone who is going to the M-C in the near future,  has read the mixed reviews. It is far from perfect, and not completely finished, but overall, it lives up to its 5 stars.my wife  I just returned, with another couple, after 7 glorious days. The food at all areas was very good, all the bars except the sports/disco bar was open,  the staff was very friendly, helpful,  obliging (It helps to tip!) The beach is awesome,  the pool (and I am not a pool person) is very nice. When we arrived on 1/4, it was like we had the place to outselves; it started to fill up on the weekend. There is still one section of rooms that they are working on-but the work for the most part goes on unnoticed. There were a few minor issues, but you have to have an open mind  empty glass towards them! We are already planning next years' trip.

<Content>Best deal for a Luxury Resort in Punta Cana for the Money! For the price we paid, our holiday is one of our best. Food was excellent, rooms are extra large  with everything we should expect. I would have appreciate a bit more international drinks, but... Service was getting better every day, since the staff have to get used to the newly opne resort (dec 15).We are use to go to brand new resort (some may say we are cheap people, but just like to have as much for our money as possible). Our Travel Agent give us the right info for this kind of trip.I would go back tomorrow if I had the time and money!Enjoy

<Content>warm breezes, balmy tropical nights My partner and I arrived at the majestic on the 30th December, knowing that the resort had just become open to the public. Feeling somewhat nervous about this, and as we were approaching the main entrance, we could see some unsconstructed areas and debris, which encited further worry...and melted away as soon as we stepped into the lobby entrance.This hotel is beautiful, elegant and eleborate. Granted, there are many details which need to be worked on, expected, I think, when considering that this is a brand new resort. I am truly sorry that so many reviewers on this page have had an unenjoyable experience, but both my partner and I have travelled throughout the world, and have never come across such lovely staff, truly friendly and welcoming, and always there to please you. This is the first time we have travelled on a fully inclusive holiday, mainly due to worry about food standards and what a resort would provide in terms of culture, surroundings and the general experience of a one stop shop. This hotel has exceeded our expectations; a truly fantastic resort, majestic with the personal touch.I can only say, overlook the minor details that the personnel are striving to resolve, meet like-minded travellers, enjoy your stay, and live well on the marvellous, elaborate culinary tastes, and the beautiful paradise that surrounds you. I'm only sorry that I couldn't have stayed longer...and that some of the wonderful people I met weren't living closer to me now!

<Content>The Worst Vacation ever We were devastated by the conditions of the resort! There were a significant number of issues and problems that we encountered including but not limited to safety, ongoing construction, lack of entertainment, lack of professionalism and completely untrained personnel. 鈥onstruction was constantly and continuously being done throughout the hotel during our stay there鈥here were no retail stores open at all 鈥nable to purchase sunscreen, medical or any other necessities (e.g. a mosquito repellent) 鈥e had to call housekeeping every day 3-4 times a day to get our room cleaned and towels changed鈥he door to the outside patio would not lock and since we were on the first floor anyone could have been coming in and out of our room鈥nternet was impossible to use because it was extremely slow鈥t was very difficult to communicate, because 1) no one spoke any English, and 2) there was no communication among the workers/staff - they were always doing and saying something different from one another. 鈥here is no voicemail in the room. So, if you are not in the room and the front desk actually decides to connect our family to our room they are unable to leave us a message. This happened twice.鈥ne of the concerns was the level of safety and security on the premises: workers placing concrete or installing sheetrock walls in spaces which were allocated for guests. They were doing it right in front of our eyes without any kind of 鈥渄anger鈥?warning signs. There were plenty of open wires in finished and unfinished rooms that had voltage already connected. A number of guests had little children with them, and this could have turned into a total disaster. 鈥here was little to no entertainment at the resort; first three days of our 鈥渧acation鈥?did not have any shows.

<Content>Not Ready For Visitors  Give this place a wide berth for at least another six months to a year.... It is not ready to offer 5 Star Service.... In fact if you are expecting a large 5 Star Hotel...you might want to go elsewhere... I don't think this place will ever really offer a 5 Star experience...They have a lot of growing pains and a lot to learn about customer satisfaction. My wife and I spent Dec. 25 to Jan. 01 at the hotel and did not enjoy our stay for one minute. Much of our stay ended up in meetings with the front desk, management, owner and tour operator. None of these meetings were very fruitful..Yes, there is a beach and yes, they have a pool, but for the amount of money you are going to spend, there are better places to go..They were still building the place when we left..with one wing of the hotel still not finished. Food quality and service was poor... The Front Desk was almost useless in solving problems.. If you are running into problems ask for the Manager, Jorge Puente Antuna... You can at least talk to him...as compared to the rest of the staff..but don't expect to get much... A small group of us did manage to speak to the the owner of the hotel (you would need Spanish) and he did make some difference to the last couple of days of our holiday.. The bar serves generic booze, no premium brands and there is only one type of beer.. The wine was/is of poor quality and the champagne was not drinkable. There is no room service...Phones don't work..except to the front desk and they won't talk to you..The food was not even close to 5 Star...and the quantity  variety was not there.. There are 7 restaurants...two of which are combined and not all the restaurants are open at the same time.. The Japanese/Chinese Restaurant is a joke.. and as the French Family we shared a table with one night said when I asked them about the French Restaurant.......It's not French and it's not a Restaurant.... Quality is just not there....If you want to waste your money go have a peek.. otherwise you can spend your money and have a better holiday with fewer headaches elsewhere...Enjoy!!!p.s. Bring your mosquito repellant...you will need it.. and check out the hotels along the beach... Better value for your money

<Content>Awesome Stay at Majestic Colonial Was at MC from Dec 22nd to Dec 29th, and am coming back with an awesome experience. This place is 5* for sure, and to anybody who's headed for MC don't worry about anything, you will definately have a good time. I went there knowing it's a new resort, and they did have some problems, but you could observe the day to day progress as they removed the kinks one by one.Best Things: - food was excellent with a huge selection and different restaurant options, and luxurious service from the staff- beautiful work on the interior and exterior design in the resort, always had a greate view where-ever you looked- great entertainment staff, kept us in the caribbean spirit throughout our stay- great beachWorst Things: - reception servicea) could use a few more people. they seemed to be understaffed at the reception specially when a bus arrived from the airport, so several times you'd end up calling the reception and nobody picking up the phone, and thus having to go to the reception for whatever service you wantedb) could use some sort of ticketing system like siebel or something, so problems or complaints could be followed up. Had a climate control problem in my room. I would inform the reception, they would tell me that they've told the appropriate department, i.e. maintenance or housekeeping - so the issue was passed on. Nothing happens, so I call again, and have to repeat the whole thing all over again.- they could have used some pesticide treatment both insides the rooms and outsideHere's some more info:What was already done ( by Dec 29th ) ?- all 7 restaurants. actually in terms of buildings ( i.e restaurant seating areas ) there are only 4 restaurants. Example the beach hut is actually sold as 3 restaurants. It's got two different kitchens, but a common seating area, i.e the hut. During the lunch-time it's called one restaurant, and for dinner it has two other names - for a steak house and a sea-food place.- all 8 bars- pool- sauna and spa- as you've must have already seen from the pictures, the resort is shaped in a U. All the rooms on one side of the U were already completed, there was work going on in the other side of the U. But, we never heard any machines running or construction noises, as the leftover work was mostly in the interior such as painting, wiring, lighting, ...- gym, opened up in the last couple of days of our stay- disco dance bar- casino- theatre, with full entertainment team- strip mall- trained staff, did not ever feel that was dealing with new untrained staffWhat was not done ?- rooms were still being worked on, on one side of the U shaped resort- a lot of last minute room preparation as people were checking in, e.g. final cleanup, or adding furniture ( like a bed ), or appliances such as a TV. But I doubt, that this will still be a problem for people coming in now.- tennis court, they were on a second coat of paint on our last day at the resort, and soccer field- children playhouse

<Content>Majestic Colonial  On December 19th I received an email from Sunwing confirming the Majestic was 100% open to the public. We arrived in Punta Cana on December 25th evening and were on the bus heading to the Majestic when Sunwing announced we were not staying at the Majestic since it was not available. Sunwing was aware of this prior to our plane departing Toronto and chose not to inform any of the passengers. One couple had already received an email from their friends that were at the Majestic so they knew this statement was incorrect. The only option we were given was to stay at a four star or three star resort. Four days after staying at the other resort the Majestic and Sunwing tried to force all 20 passengers to sign a release not holding Sunwing and the Majestic liable for this change and in return you would recieve 1 week free at the Majestic in low season or upon availability and you would need to pay for your airfare.I could provide additional details of what occurred over the entire week but it won't be as beneficial to you. My only suggestion would be if you have booked a trip with Sunwing and/or at the Majestic you seriously consider cancelling unless you would like a stressful holiday.

<Content>Question I did not travel, but my daughter is at the Majestic right now. She called my from her cell phone and gave the room number and hotel phone number (from hotel papers). I tried to call - no connections at all. Should anyone provide the working phone number of the resort?I would not even tell about the rest of her first (and second) impression - I simply could not reach her.

<Author>BlueSpiritTraveler
<Content>LOTS OF PROBLEMS - STAY AWAY Where do I start? First, if you are even considering a vacation here, be warned to go elsewhere. This place is not what your travel agent may tell you. It is not nearly finished and should never have opened to the public - bad management. There are many safety hazards due to the fact that it's still undergoing construction - loose wires, rocks and dirt piles, etc. Aside from that, it lacks many basic services and amenities, much less anything approaching the 5-star quality that it is supposed to be.CHECK INWe pre-booked and prepaid for everything. When we arrived, they did not have ANY room for us at all. The hotel staff and management did nothing to assist us and were totally unresponsive to our queries or concerns (or offered tips) that we had a 3-year old child, nothing to eat, and nowhere to sleep. We saw and talked to many other people in the lobby who were stuck there for hours with no rooms, either. The resort was literally building the rooms and moving in the furniture as we waited, but even that couldn't make up for all the guests waiting for rooms. We finally had to go to a different resort for that first night, which we ourselves had to arrange since the entire staff was overworked, had many other people yelling at them, and were completely incapable of doing anything to help. Luckily we were able to find another resort with a room available for one night. The next day we finally got a room back at Majestic Colonial. Too bad.FOODTotally sub-par. NOT 5-star. Mostly buffet. House wine AWFUL. Even the choice of menu wines that you have to pay for were bad - nothing for a serious (or even casual) wine-drinker to enjoy. Bar service was chaotic at best. The entire staff is so obviously untrained - they literally walk back and forth doing nothing with dazed looks on their faces; if what you ask of them is too much (like ordering a drink), sometimes they will outright ignore you and walk away. Finally we found one server who was decent and just tried to seek her out whenever we wanted something. The a la carte restaraunts were okay, but not great. There are times of the day when there is no food available, which is unfortunate if you don't like to rush or have a timetable to adhere to, or if you have a child who naps through meal times and then is hungry when nothing is available. We were told there would be snacks, but these turned out to be only hotdogs and hamburgers at the beach bar - not the healthiest choice.ROOMSThe room we had was actually nice - poolside with private jacuzzi, which we used every day. The all marble showers and floors were beautiful but treacherously slippery. The room had a few issues - looked like it was rushed through, and there were a few holes and missed seals in the walls and corners and ceiling; I suppose that's how mosquitos constantly entered the room. Also, there were very loud crickets somewhere in the room that chirped constantly all night (no exaggeration), which got a bit annoying. No facecloths, no tissues, no garbage can, no mini bar (unless you consider a small fridge of bottled water and sodas), no snacks, no shower soap, only tiny circles of hand soap.GROUNDSThe grounds were very nice, but the landscaping needs filling in (the least of your worries, believe me). The paths are downright dumb - some lead nowhere, and you see guests cutting across grass and low shrubs to conveniently get to where they are going. Also, lighting is lacking in many places, making it a bit dangerous in places (like the bridges that cross the pool) at nighttime.POOLThe pool is the one thing that was gorgeous - a very long, huge, freeform pool. It seemed clean enough and we enjoyed that. We were a bit worried about a few troublesome filter areas that looked potentially dangerous to children, but we just stayed away from those. The bar by the pool is a bit annoying, as there was always some 'activity' staff trying to get tourists to do things - play volleyball, limbo, dance, or do other strange tourist trap type activities, and very loud ones.SPASpa, although open, is not quite ready, either. I had two appointments, which were botched (overbooked). The massage I got was basic, and the girl was so sick she had to leave the room twice to deal with her coughing fits. The showers, steam room and sauna were nice, but again, not quite ready yet.BEACHBeach is pretty - soft sand, clean water; saw some reef area and lots of fish (surprising). But near the resort there are a lot of construction rocks that were just thrown there and are now mixed with the sand, and also lots of broken glass. The beach chairs are comfortable but not enough of them for all the guests. There are catamarans and banana boats and donuts (?) and speed boats and kayaks available. We didn't do any of that, but people who did looked like they were having fun. One thing that was annoying were the many helicopters that constantly flew over the resort and buzzed quite close to the water and swimmers a few times - I think they are tourists on pleasure rides. We walked down the beach to see some of the other resorts. All the same, more or less. Lots of people, crowded bars, crowded pools.SUMMARYThe entire Punta Cana strip is basically row after row of all-inclusive mega resorts that cater to those who enjoy non-stop drinking and loud music. If that is your taste, you will like it here. If you prefer a quiet, relaxing vacation, you would be well-advised to consider somewhere else altogether. If you DO go to Punta Cana, stay away from Majestic Colonial for at least another year - it is simply not ready and not worth the headaches of everything that it is struggling with - no matter what discount your travel agent offers. If you're looking for 5-star, or any quality vacation, this is not it.
