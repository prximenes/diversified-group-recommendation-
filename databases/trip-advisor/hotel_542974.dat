<Content>Do not stay here! I knew that staying at a 3-star hotel would not put me at the Ritz, but this place was a dump, complete with feces and vomit on the front sidewalk and a man hitting a woman with a bottle while their dogs fought just around the corner. The heater in our room never worked the entire time we were there, while the outside temp was no more than 45 F. Breakfast was not available unless we had ordered it the night before. And the excuse for all of this was that we were there on a holiday. The one nice thing was that we were allowed to keep our luggage in their storage closet till our flight time later in the day. The reviews I read before booking made it sound like a decent place. Not the case! There must be better hotels in Barcelona!!!

<Content>Very good city hotel We spent a night in the Hesperia del Port in Barcelona. The hotel is located very close to the Ramblas, perfect for visiting the town. The area is ok, but follow the recommendations of the hotel to reach the town center. The hotel is nice and clean, the room was good, better than what we expected from a 3 stars; the rooms were all new. We didn't have breakfast. There were spanish newspapers available (no english ones). The hotel staff was very friendly and helpfulWe had a car, which we parked in a public parking lot in front of the hotel; the hotel does not have its own parking lot, and in the street is not easy to park.We are very happy with our stay, and will definitely return when visiting Barcelona (next time without car). Good value for the money

<Content>Ditto what other reviewers wrote - great location, good service Hesperia is a great value hotel especially if you're booking on the weekend (cheaper than anything else I could find around the city center). They have wireless internet, located on Avenguda Parallel which is a 10 minute walk to the Christopher Columbus Statue at the bottom of La Rambla. Breakfast was overpriced so we didn't get it but otherwise we were very happy with this hotel. Highly recommended for tourists!

<Content>Just what we needed...location, price Our first stop in our first European trip.Front desk Staff VERY friendly and helpful... After an overnight flight, they us to check in early, when we just expected to have them store our luggage for a few hours before checkin time. The following morning we noticed that I forgot to pack hairspray, went to front desk to ask location of nearest store and she indicated that they were all closed on Sunday, she went to her purse and handed me her personal supply. NOW THAT is helpful staff!Location is in la Rambla area and within a 4-5 block walk to pick up tour buses. We used Bus Turistic which was very informative and well worth the money. Great for first time travelers to Barcelona. Several eateries close by as well. Room was very clean and updated. Bed was more comfortable than it looked (looked like a box). Bathroom was modern, clean and well kept but must say this is where I say be careful!!! The shower floor was very slippery and only a partial glass wall (see pic on this site of bath) and then open to the room. We both almost fell and it would most likely been a serious injury.

<Content>Good Spot Stayed at this hotel for one night prior to a cruise. It is fairly close to the port so the taxi fare is not too expensive (15 euros, 4 persons). The hotel was 100 euros for the night and was modern and clean. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful especially Sonia who spoke very good english and could not do enough for us. Will stay again if we are in Barcelona. Be aware of very talented pick pockets in Barcelona. Sonia told us she has been a victim 3 times this year. I spotted a women about 20 move beside my sister in law and move her hand to my sister in law's pouch. After yelling at the pick pocket and belting her with my walking stick across the rear she left.

<Content>Great location, great beds Stayed here for 3 nights. We stayed on top floor at the back and it was very quiet and great black out blinds. The beds were vey comfortable and the rooms were small but sufficient for a city break. The hotel was very clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. We took breakfast at 9.50 euros per day and it was very good ( eggs, sausages, bacon, pastry, fruit, toast, juice etc). The location is excellent near La Rambla and the Port but be careful when you are walking back from La Rambla, go down to the bottom and come across on the Av de les Drassanes beside the Museu Maritim onto the Av del Parallel and do not cut across up La Rambla as it is not a very nice area. If I go back to Barcelona and want to stay in the city, I will be checking out the Hesperia del Port.

<Content>Underrated. Good location, Modern comfort. This hotel was a real find. We spent 4 nights here in June. A great location on Paral.lel... 7-8 minute walk from La Rambla, 3 minute walk from nearest subway station (Diagonal) and the funicular that whisks you up to Montjuic, 10 minute walk from the port area where the seaside shopping complex is. A lot of tourists prefer to stay in the middle of action right on La Rambla or in and around the Old City, but I personally prefer this hotel's location since the area's not quite as hectic. The rooms are more modern and cleaner and the service is much more professional than what I expected of a 3-star Spanish hotel. The front desk staff is helpful and efficient and all speak English well. The guestroom was very clean; maybe it was recently renovated. The bathroom had a very modern design, with glass shower door. The housekeeping was generous in replenishing toiletries (which were of pretty good quality) and towels everyday... not something you can count on at every 3-star hotel in mediterranean Europe. Beds were not that comfortable, but not too horrible either.Back to the location issue... if you take the straight path from the hotel to La Ramble, you'd be walking through a bit of a rough area of Barcelona. If you're a woman, my best advice is to be mindful of your belongings during the day and to avoid walking there alone altogether at night.We would definitely stay here again if the price is right.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, very helpful staff We booked this hotel on Hotwire and got a great deal for two nights before our cruise. The hotel has one of the best overal in Barcelona, within a few yards to the underground, five minutes walk to Las Ramblas and five minutes walk to the beautiful modern port area where there are endless walks and pleasure boat trips available.We were going on a cruise and needed a taxi to get to the cruise port (12 - 20 euro, depending on the driver).The trip in from the airport cost just over 30 Euros and takes about 20 minutes depending on traffic although evening rush hours can take over an hour easily.The hotel staff were excellent and they offer free WiFi access or broadband using their own business centre if you do not carry your own laptop.The breakfast buffet in the hotel is a bit limited but if you purchase breakfasts for the full duration of your stay it will only cost 9.50 Euro and is very reasonable as the food is of good quality although the hot items are a bit limited. Or if you prefer there are plenty of restaurants and bakeries within a few minutes walk.

<Content>Nice and modern hotel, small but nice rooms Hotel has a great location, 5 minutes walk to the port and Ramblas, 2 minutes walk from funicular to Montjuic. Location couldn't be better with plenty of nice and cheap restaurants around.Reception staff polite and helpfull. Check in/out quick.Room was small but very nice, with nice and modern bathroom. However it is not very bright and we had room on the 7th floor, the view was like being in Baghdad with Middle East style roof tops but it didn't bother us too much. :-) I would say try and get the room facing the main road but it is quite busy and probably noisy.Room equipped with safe, mini bar, bed comfy and big. Air conditioning throughout the hotel. When I go to Barcelona next time surely this is going to be the first hotel I'll look into.

<Content>Great Location,Small Room Barcelona is one of the worlds great walking cities and fortunately the Hesperia Port is extremely well located .5 minutes from the Port or the bottom of Las Ramblas.Metro stop less than 2 minutes away.The Hotel was disappointing due to the basic rooms. Two twin beds, no view and smaller than average.No decorations.Hesperia has a great reputation and I expected more.The staff was excellent and friendly at all times.Eat at the bakery next door. Superb coffee and croissant for about 3 euro.

<Content>just right just got back from barca for a lads holiday last week. stayed here for four nights. the location of the hotel was one of the best things about it. about a 10 min walk form Las Ramblas. The rooms are of adequte size and always kept spotless. showers are great, although in one room water was leaking from the door. The pillows were very comfortale, as mentioned in another review. the bathrooms and rooms have a modern feel.We only had breakfast once, cant reccomend it however.The staff were excellent, helpful and very tolerant, considering how much noise we made one night.noise travels easily in the hotel so try get a room on the top floor.overall i would reccomend this hotel to anybody for a short stay.

<Content>Basic hotel, great location My brother and I spent two nights at this hotel during a brief and hugely enjoyable, tourist visit to Barcelona. The hotel's main asset is its location. It is c100m from the bottom of La Ramblas. Our room was a typical twin. It was clean, clearly smoking-free with a view out to the back of the hotel. It was perfect for our needs. The furniture and shower unit were a little 1970s. The hotel staff were very helpful and all seemed to speak good English. We did not take breakfast. It was a self-service offering, in a smallarea to the left of the hotel reception. I cant imagine why you'd take breakfast in the hotel: downtown Barca is just round the corner.

<Content>Great hotel but security not ideal! We stayed at the Hesperia Del Port for a long weekend after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel itself was modern and clean with pleasant staff at reception. The location was also excellent with a Metro stop just outside and La Rambla and the beach a 10 min walk away. However, on our penultimate day one of my expensive toiletries went missing. I am an organised person and as only myself and my partner were sharing the room, I can only assume that it was taken by a member of the staff. This was a very disappointing ending to an otherwise pleasant stay. I would not dissuade others from staying here but I would recommend keeping any expensive products in the safety deposit box.

<Content>Great Hotel for Weekend Getaway We stayed in this hotel for just two nights over the Easter weekend. It was great value for money and although we had a missing leg on our bed, which was promptly fixed, the staff at the hotel did their best to make the rest of our stay as comfortable as possible. The room wasn't massive but ideal for what we needed, ie a place to sleep. The hotel was clean and nicely presented, it is in a great location and I would stay there again if I go back to Barcelona.

<Content>Very comfortable beds  Great 3 star hotel in a brilliant location, 5 mins walk from the Maremagnum and Las Ramblas. Good sized and clean rooms, complete with safe, and big beds! My partner's 6'3 and we had a huge bed - much better than you ever get in budget chains like the Novotel. Mini bar in room was kept well stocked, good size bathroom  powerful shower. All round a great place to stay and excellent value, we'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Decent hotel I stayed there for several nights a little while ago for business . . . Positives:- Hotel is relatively clean and new- Hotel staff are courteous and as helpful as they can be (some know english a little better than the others but I give them all points for effort).-Breakfast is fine (never crowded, that's for sure).- Decent location; area may at first seem a little dicey but after spending a little time walking around you'll realize that the area is fine. It's also within walking distance to a number of things to see (such as Las Ramblas, martime museum, etc). - Easy to use, free wi-fi internet (bring your laptop!). The front desk can issue you a username/password to connect. Negatives:My room was VERY small. Of course it kept me out doing things which ended up being better for me in the end.No room service.Overall, I'd say it was a decent value (especially compared to the very expensive Grand Marina where several of my colleagues stayed -- and they charge an extra $29 E a day just for the internet access). I'd also highly recommend taking one of those Turist buses (with the open tops). They continually run along designated routes in the city and you can get 1 and 2 day passes with unlimited on and off privileges during the 1 or 2 day period. The blue line is the shorter one but still has MANY interesting stops in Barcelona (and from the open air top you see things that you couldn't see in a car, taxi, or even walking). In my opinion Barcelona is a great city to visit (although not great like Paris, but then what is?)

The bedroom was big enough for the few days we were there.We had breakfast 3 mornings which was good value for money. Thought overall the hotel was excellent value for money in a good location and would return to this hotel if I visited Barcelona again.

<Content>Good value for money I agree with the other reviewers that this hotel has an excellent location and is good value for money. During our stay (last week of July 2006) I could find only one thing to complain about: the air conditioning wasn't working as well as I would have liked. The staff explained that it was impossible to cool the rooms any better due to the hot weather (over +30 degrees celcius). However, the hotel lobby was really nice and cool compared to the room...Additionally, I found that some of the staff did'nt speak English that well.We had the hotel breakfast on three mornings. Although it costs 10 euros, we found that is quite good value for money. There were different kinds of bread, sweet pastries, youghurt, cheeses, bacon, scrambled eggs, cold cuts, juices, coffee, tea, cereals etc. It gave us a good start for the day without the need to search for breakfast downtown with an empty stomach. A few recommendations: if you like Japanese food, there is an excellent Japanese restaurant up the avenue Paralelo (close to the metro stop Paral-lel). Ate there twice during the week :) Also, we enjoyed a 1,5 hour sailing trip with a 75-foot catamaran for just 10,95 éˆ§?(discounted price if you have the Bus Turistic ticket).
