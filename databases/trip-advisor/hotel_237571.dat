<Content>Made to feel like a criminal The worst possible advert for accommodation for singles, I was put in a third floor room smaller than a prison cell and made to feel most unwelcome by the reception staff. I am not overly fussy about room size but this room was barely 1.5metres wide and only two metres longer than the bed. To watch the tiny TV with poor reception or to read I could not sit with my back against the headboard as the tiny wardrobe was built above my pillow. It was, of course, hopeless for hanging anything full length in as it was suitable for shirts only.My first day experience of the staff was adequate - little did I know that that was to be the highlight of my stay. Having arrived on time yet been kept waiting 10 minutes to check in in a small lobby that smelt like a pub it was so smokey, the young woman who signed me in was fairly friendly and gave me a free map. In really broken English she told me - or so I thought at the time - that I could use the downstairs kitchen to heat food up in (I was staying for a week, so thought this a helpful suggestion to keep costs down).Thanks to a key entry system this was my only dealing with hotel staff until, four days into my stay, a woman receptionist rushed up to me as I was about to get into the lift - which only worked for part of the day to avoid disturbing guests with its noise. She asked me, rather rudely, if I smoked. As a lifelong non-smoker I took offence to her question and her tone - particularly as she, and the whole of the reception area, always smelt of newly-smoked cigarettes whenever I walked past.Luckily I knew friends in a nearby street, so I did not have to use the hotel much, or its kitchen at all, until the penultimate day of my visit. Then, having enjoyed a long walk on a sunny afternoon through the beautiful Vondel Park behind the hotel, I stepped into the kitchen to fill my bottle up with water. The receptionist was out like a flash, asking me what I was doing and telling me, in no uncertain terms, not to go into the kitchen again. I tried to explain that I thought this was what I had been told on my first day, but the receptionist either did not understand or believe me.Thankfully it was nearly time to go home. Despite being in the hotel for a week my sheets were never changed nor my bathroom cleaned. I couldn't wait to leave my little cell, and I will certainly never again pay 100 euros a day for such an experience.

<Content>Great Hotel The Borgmann Villa is a quaint and charming hotel in a residential area of Amsterdam. There are many reasons to recommend this hotel. The managers were extremely welcoming, friendly, and helpful, spending as much time with me as I needed to help me plan my days in Amsterdam. (They even, without my asking, changed my room to a lower floor because claustrophobia prevents my use of small lifts!) Located right on Vondel Park, the location was not only pretty, but quiet after a busy and noisy day in the city. The hotel is very well situated for public transportation, just a few minute walk to the stop for Tram 2. As a single woman traveler, I felt very safe in the area and in the hotel itself. The hotel offers WiFi for a fee, but for quick internet useage, I was able to plug in downstairs in the lobby for no charge. The room was spacious and clean, with modern bathroom facilities. My only complaint, and it's a very small one, is that the lighting in the room was not great for reading once the sun went down. Overall, my three-night stay at the Borgmann was an excellent experience and I would happily stay again if I ever return to Amsterdam.

<Content>Comfortable and convenient. I spent a week at the Borgmann Villa Hotel at the end of March 2008. I was offered either a single room at 99 Euros/ night (rejected because tiny) and a much bigger double for single use at 120 per night which I chose. Breakfast (boiled egg, ham, cold meats, cheese, cereal etc) 12 Euros extra, a slight irritation. Half way through I pointed out that there was no fresh fruit, and the following day apples appeared. It's in an area of very grand residences, next door in fact to the British Consulate, and adjacent to the beautiful Vondelpark which is the view from the breakfast room. The nearby number 2 tram takes you to the museums or the city centre in a few stops. The hotel is nicer than one might expect from three stars: everything works, beds are comfortable and staff are pleasant and helpful. At 132 Euros a night incluiding b'fast it felt a bit expensive but if you stay here you'll have the peace of mind of knowing that you'll be comfortale and well looked after.

<Content>Borgmann is best It's an excellent hotel, in a quiet part of Amsterdam, located near embassies, but still reasonably close to the city. our room had a lovely bay window, comfortable beds. Wireless internet was setup for us. The manager was extremely helpful in pointing out places to go and how to get around. After staying in many hotels in the US and Europe, this was one to remember. We booked through wotif.com for a very reasonable rate.

<Content>Peaceful location, warm welcome My girlfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend. We booked the Borgmann because it was a short walk to the start of the Amsterdam Half Marathon (as we were taking part). The staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke good english. The location is great. it backs on to the park and is situated in a very affluent area and so is very quiet. It is a good 15 min walk to the edge of town. But you can get a tram 5 mins away.We hired bikes which are great for Amsterdam. Makes it much easier to get around. Not sure if it was worth the 拢100 per night though!

<Content>Finally the hotel I was looking for! I stayed in the Borgmann Villa Hotel this month and it was marvelous. The staff received me with great warmth and I felt very much at home (this has far from always been the case in hotels for me). I recommend the Borgmann for everybody, young till old, solo or groups, because of the ideal location and good price-value (dare I say, more value then price!). But beware, you'll be sad when you leave ;)

<Content>Lovely location but..... Just back from a three day break. The location is quiet and overlooks the very attractive Vondelpark and we had a very nice room. Breakfast though was very modest - we expected more for the price. We had to leave at 7.30am on the last day (Saturday) so we could not have breakfast and although sandwiches and a couple of hard boiled eggs were provided the night before, to take with us, it was hardly adequate. It would have been nice if someone had made the effort to get up early (7am) to set up the (even modest) breakfast.On a separate issue, allow loads of time at Amsterdam Airport and, if possible, avoid a taxi trip from the hotel to the airport, it cost us 32 Euros for the 8 minute journey!

<Content>OK but pretty basic... Had booked via venure and booking stated a Double room. I even emailed the hotel direct the day before our sta to confirm it all. When we arrived it was two single beds, individually made but pushed together. We mentioned this to the staff but they said they couldn't re-make it 'til the next day (we were only staying 3 days).The next day the two sngle beds were made as one, however there was no sheet underneath so the beds kept splitting apart and we kept falling down the middle.The staff didn't seemed bothered at all about our problem and no effort to rectify it or even acknowledge it as a problem.The hotel was basic, clean enough but nothing special.Olga is a sweetie and was very helpful with tips on where to go. A good tip was to go to Van Gough museum on Friday night because it's late night opening until 10pm and much quieter than during the day.

<Content>The restful place Lovely place close to a huge park. Quiet (I'm demanding !) 5 minutes walking distance to the tram stop (number 2) that takes you downtown and in 10-25 min to the central train station.If you just missed the tram, you have coffee and tea shops just opposite (breakfast).Nice crew (thanks Olga, Dimitri and Klime !) very friendly.I paid a special deal 3 nights for 195 euros for a single roomin July (High season). Excellent price for amsterdam. You will be happy to rest there after walking for hours in the center !Will go back there when I go back to Amsterdam.(Klime, you should use the vacuum cleaner more often in the rooms even though the cleanliness is good otherwise) :-)Have a nice stayGoodtipfellow

<Content>Not so great We stayed two nights at the Borgmann Villa in April 07. We liked the location but there were some drawbacks. We were given a room on the 4th floor which required using many steep and narrow steps, as the elevator is shut down in the evening. The room had only one window and no fans - very stuffy. There was no place to unpack as the room had no drawers and only limited hanging space. The breakfast, while adequate, was not extensive. In summary, we expected more for the considerable price of the room.

<Content>Lovely Location Average Hotel Having read all the glowing reports on this site about the Hotel Borgmann Villa i was a bit disappointed with our three night stay last week. I must admit the location of the property is first class beside the park and the trams make it easily accessible to the city centre.The rooms are very basic and despite sending two emails which were not answered and a telephone call requesting a view of the park our room faced directly onto next door, i know they were full but not answering emails is a bit frustrating. Maybe my expectations were high reading all the reviews but it is a very basic 3 star hotel nothing more nothing less. Also be prepared for an additional local tax onto your bill despite any confirmation emails from your internet booking site that say it is already included.

<Content>A quiet, small, friendly place We stayed for almost a week at the Borgmann Villa Hotel. It sits in a quiet and stately neighborhood on Vondel park. It is a long walk into the center of town, but it is easy to take the tram or busses. Rent a bicycle, which is the best way to travel the city, and will make everything in the city quickly accessible. The rooms are comfortable and very quiet. The managers helped me connect with Wifi and the lovely dining area was available to get work done. The hotel was convenient to RAI, the Congress center, by bicycle, but it's a long walk.I found it difficult to find a reasonably priced hotel in Amersterdam, and the Borgmann, while not cheap, was a good deal 8-)

<Content>What's all the fuss about? We stayed for six nights at the Borgmann on the basis of the glowing tributes on your site. The sign at the door stated 'sorry, we're full' and that certainly proved to be the case next morning with standing room only in the small breakfast room. Despite my having booked in February and emailing a month ahead to request a park view,we were allocated a small twin attic room overlooking the front entrance. Upon enquiring why, I was told by the owner in a halting Russian English that each week, I check. He obviously had not paid much attention to my email as he did not even have the courtesy to reply. Worse was to follow when I asked about the laptop PC advertised in the guest folder, in order to get a weather (rain!) forecast.Clearly this did not exist, as the 'on request' part was met with a shrug. The hotel's motto is 'We'll take care of you' but this I'm afraid did not extend to any information about local restaurants. Care further extends to three-star luxury items such as plastic cups in the rooms (rationed to one per person per day), a 'mini-bar' which consists of an ordinary cupboard with overpriced warm drinks/tampered snacks, a lift that is switched off at 10 each night and a first change of bed linen the day before we left!! As for the breakfast, my tip is to avoid the ersatz coffee, jam-portion-size cereal bowls and crispbread (all for the princely sum of 12 Euro pp!!) altogether - head for the excellent cheese roll shop at the end of Koningslaan by the Emmastraat tram stop (next to Cafe Lexington). Did we really stay at the same hotel as your other reviewers? All in all, we found the Villa B (Which we happily nicknamed 'The Lubyanka' for the term of our stay- 5 nights too many) one of the worst/most overrated 3-star hotels we have yet encountered in Europe. It should be exposed for the mean attitude of the staff and the rip-off that are the 'hidden extras'. I am also taking this information to the hotel's trade body in the hope that they will review its star rating.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Three of us women travelling together selected this hotel and spent 4 nights there in April, 2007. It was a wonderful experience. Our 2 rooms had a view of Vondelpark, which we used for jogging and walking. The neighborhood was beautiful, with the British Consulate located next door. It was a short walk to the tram, to good restaurants and to the Museum Plein (Rijksmuseum/Van Gogh Museum). The furnishings were nice with a desk and chair in addition to the twin beds. The bathrooms were excellent. The rooms were quiet and service was efficient.The staff was most helpful. They recommended a free noon concert at the Concert House which was one of the highlights of our stay. We rate this hotel as one of the best ever!!

<Content>Nice hotel in a nice location We recently stayed here for 2 nights. Based on other Trip Advisor reviews, we requested a room with a balcony overlooking Vondelpark, and were lucky enough to get one. It is definitely worth asking for one, as it is lovely to sit and look out over the park.The hotel is located in a nice residential area that feels very safe. You are a short walk from the No. 2 tram which will take you into the city centre and to Central Station. We used a stripticket on the trams which was very good value compared to cash fares. You can also walk via Vondelpark, but it will take you about 20-30 mins. Don't stay here if you want to be in the thick of the action!The room was a good enough size, with a comfortable bed and pillows, and was clean and airy. The bathroom was adequate with okay water pressure and enough hot water. One night of our stay was a Saturday, so there was a little bit of noise from other guests, but on the second night, we didn't hear anything.The breakfast provided is good - juice, tea/coffee, cereals, bread/toast, meats, cheese, eggs, yoghurt etc. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.We enjoyed our stay at Borgmann Villa Hotel and would probably stay here again. Definitely the best thing for us was the quiet, residential location, and the reasonable price.

<Content>Bumped from the Villa I booked a single room through the Internet for one night, from Friday to Saturday, February 23-24, during the slow tourist season. The room was no longer available when I arrived at 7 AM because of a supposed double-booking and fault of the Internet. After I had booked my reservation, weeks in advance, two couples in my group and at my recommendation booked double rooms there as well, but for two nights and directly. It seems their more profitable direct booking of 8 person nights was given priority over my agency booking of 1 person night and I was bumped. The clerk gave me 10鈧?to cover higher cost of parking in the other neighborhood and sent to another hotel. Bottom line is: if you book here by internet, I suggest you follow up with a call to the hotel and get their written confirmation. Otherwise you could land on the street if guests promising a better profit should appear. After all, it's all about money.

<Content>Loved the Borgmann Villa Hotel If you are planning to stay in Amsterdam and would like a quiet, family run hotel, I fully recommend the Borgmann Villa. It's in a quiet area of town just beside the Vondelpark but with quick tram access to the centre (as well as a lovely stroll through the park which takes you to the Museum Quarter and the edge of the canal system). It is a small hotel which lives up to its slogan We will take care of you. Reasonably priced, very pleasant rooms, lovely location, and very attentive family service. What more could you ask?Frank YoungmanGaboroneBotswana

<Content>Woud definitely stay there again and would recommend to friends. The hotel is nicely situated in a quiet suburb of Amsterdam, (a couple of doors down from the British Consulate so you can imagine it is quite a nice area) and overlooks, at the rear, the Vondelpark. Easy to access from one of two tram stops on the number 2 route.The room we were given was a generous size and clean, overlooking the park, with a mini bar and small TV which had some BBC channels. Lift available for those heavy bags!Staff were friendly and helpful which was a big plus. Breakfast is basic continental style served from a very nice breakfast room.Child friendly too which is another plus.

<Content>Charming hotel with friendly service My colleague and I booked this lovely 3-star hotel based largely on the recommendation of Trip Advisor reviewers and we're not sorry we did. It provided a calm respite from central Amsterdam, with only a short tram ride to a variety of local attractions. Our triple room came with three single beds, a large bathroom and a nice view out to Vondal Park. While the hotel offers wireless internet at 10 Euros a day, we were able to pick up free wireless from our rooms for free. We found the staff friendly and helpful and felt we got a taste of the real Holland. Although it did't bother us any, it probably should be noted that the British Consulate is right next door and the obvious police presence and high fence might cause some sensitive travellers a little concern.

<Content>Really a Lovely, Friendly hotel I have stayed in this hotel for a number of times now, first booked thru internet, now I contact the hotel directly, as they know us now. This is the best find we ever did in hotels! Hotel is small, quiet, cozy, in a lovely area of Amsterdam, the staff extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms vary. Some are a bit small, but most rooms I've been in are good. Some rooms facing Vondelpark are really special, spacious and nice! It's a quiet place, although from the street early noises from people/traffic going to work can come through, but it's not too bothersome. I love the location. Other big advantages: you can park your car here without any problems. Costs per day now 12 Euro which is quiete acceptable in Amsterdam. You can walk thru the lovely Vondelpark to the city centre (10 to 15 minutes), a truly lovely walk, you can take the tram which is close to the hotel and be in the city centre in like 10 minutes. Big musea and concertgebouw are closeby. You can get very reasonable rates at this hotel. I wouldn't stay anyplace else! In December I will be there again... :-)

<Content>Great place, great people I had an occasion to stay at the Villa Borgman on two occasions.The first visit was very satisfactory and based on that I booked to stay there a second time. On having my office make specific arrangements for a very early check 鈥搃n, as I would be arriving in Amsterdam at 4 am after a long haul flight of 13 hours. I was greeted by the desk staff not knowing anything about my booking. Needless to say I was un-amused by this. However rather than leave me floundering as to what to do next, the Villa Borgman staff swung into action made me comfortable gave me cups of tea apologised and at the earliest opportunity got me into a room, ( please remember this is all happening at 4:00am). I have been lucky to stay in some of the best hotels in the world. And spent the early part of my stay in Amsterdam during my relocation in six different hotels. Something will always go wrong, the way to judge a hotels how well the staff act when problems arise. The warm family atmosphere is what will keep me going back and recommending it to my friends. I can鈥檛 give any higher praise than that.

<Content>Very freindly staff, excellent location, good value ... I have travelled to Amsterdam a lot with work and this is one of my better accommodation experiences. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. The hotel - the (my) bedroom and the breakfast room - was clean and all services (including wireless internet access) worked.The location - next to Vondelpark - was brilliant. It was quiet and safe, with excellent restaurants (i.e. good food at reasonable price) close by.Bearing in mind that I was in Amsterdam at a very busy exhibition period, the cost of the hotel accommodation and breakfast was very reasonable.

<Content>great location near Vondel Park Just got back from Amsterdam and was very happy with my stay at the Borgmann. The staff is very friendly (it's family-owned) and the location is great in a quiet area of Amsterdam right next to beautiful Vondel Park. Though not right in the center of town, it's an easy tram ride (about a 5 minute walk to the tram stop) to the town center and I liked being able to come home to an area that is not right in the middle of things. Single rooms are small but I peeked into a double room that looked quite large. Good value for the price. I was able to find a rate of $119 USD per night through internet search.

<Content>Great Location The Borgmann Villa backs on to Amsterdams beautiful Vondel Park and a room with a view is great, Its a 10 min walk to the Museum's and Leidseplein, the tram is 3 min's away, breakfast at Cafe Vertigo in Voldel park is worth the trouble. Some single rooms are small but I only slept there so it was fine, I thought it was good value and the location was great the staff very very helpful (they even loaned me a bike) and its quiet after a busy day. I will stay there again.

<Content>Great place I was happy to make my choice for Villa Borgmann Hotel out of all the places I had been looking through.Comfortable, peaceful, tranquil and clean place.I liked closeness of the park, that became my usual route to the city center. it was about 15 minutes walk.I was staying a single room, that was not very big (coresponding Dutch standards), but it had a lovely park view.Villa Borgmann for me is a place to come back one more time at least.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We spent 3 days in Villa Borgmann Hotel. But even this short time was enough to experience its hospitality and cosiness. We were happy to find out that many places we wanted to visit were walking distance from the hotel. Though the tram connection never disappointed us.The hotel is loctaed in a picturesque district of Amsterdam, entrance to the park in a few meters from the hotel. Thus we could enjoy walks through the park.We were treated in a very friendly and kind way, having been told about an extended cultural programme in the city. It was very helpful, so we could see many interesting things.

<Content>Nice with one caveat I appreciated the nice, quiet neighborhood where this hotel is located. Its peaceful and refreshing compared to the busy areas near the center towards the train station. The staff at the the reception were very friendly and took time to answer our questions. Room had a nice view of the park and canal. There is some noise from the park in the evenings from the people having picnics etc., but it becomes background chatter and easy to get used to. In the morning you can hear only the birds chirping (and there are many varieties due to the general leafiness of the area). We noticed some mosquitoes in the evening due to the close proximity to the lake nearby I guess, but they were not too bothersome. The neighborhood is very nice, some nice restaurants, and grocery stores nearby selling organic produce. Nice tapas place 5-minute walk! The only thing that bothered us was the room cleaning service - the bedsheets are changed every 3 days. Once we wanted to change the sheet after one day, and deliberately put the sheet in the bathroom floor for this purpose. However, much to our surprise, the sheets were put back on the bed from the wet bathroom floor! After we explained the situation to the front desk, they were sympathetic and quickly gave us new sheets. They explained that the cleaning staff was outsourced to an outside company, and beyond their control. Other than this small mishap, its a great hotel in a peaceful, quiet area, and the front desk staff was quite nice and helpful.

<Content>Wonderful place to experience Amsterdam We spent a lovely time staying in Villa Borgmann Hotel. From the very first moment friendly stuff was taking care of us letting us know more things about the city, its attractions, transport etc. We loved walking to the city center through the park, that is so coveniently located behind the hotel.The room was big enough and cleaned properly frequently as we were staying for 6 days.The hotel is located in a peaceful and beautiful residential area, that makes it even more attractive.Villa Borgmann is a place to be! If we had a chance to get back to Amsterdam, we would be definitely staying over in Villa Borgmann.

<Content>Average Hotel We were disappointed to find just how far away this hotel was from the centre of Amsterdam. It involved a 40 min tram ride and cost lots of euros each time. The area in which it is placed is a nice one but there is a park by the hotel where teenagers congregate at night and create a lot of noise until after midnight,which does not help when you are trying to get to sleep.The hotel is also on the take off path for Schipol Airport which means even more disturbed sleep. There is no air conditioning which means that in extremely hot weather windows had to be opened wide letting in the noise of aircraft and rowdy teenagers! Beware of the ancient lift which is like a 'dumb waiter' anywhere else in the world this lift would be in a museum! The food was good and the staff OK. I rate this as distinctly average. Be careful to add extra for the local tax (some idea of the actual cost before hand would have been helpful). Be aware of an Internet Booking Charge added to your bill as well! Why? We did not use the internet at the hotel we only booked by internet from home.

<Content>One of the best places to stay in Amsterdam The Borgmann Villa is a quiet little beauty of a hotel bordering on the city's tranquil Vondelpark. The hotel is not luxurious, but the rooms are nice, clean, and very Dutch, and you should definitely ask for a park view room (#24 had a 2nd floor balcony overlooking the park). Its very close to a square with a bakery, cafe, deli, tobacco shop and tram stop. Its a close walk (10 min) to the leidseplein, shopping district and museums, and there are also some good restaurants a few blocks away at the southern end of the vondelpark. The main action of the center of the horseshoe of old amsterdam is farther away (20-30 min walk), and if you want to be in the thick of it, you might be disappointed to be out in this neighborhood of mansions and villas. Cab rides from the leidseplein are about 10 euro, and downtown about 20 euro. the tram does run til midnight and is very dependable and safe.the hotel was very clean, inexpensive compared to hotels in the horseshoe, and staffed by some of the nicest people youll encounter. They have answers to every question you need to know about exploring the city and are supply you with all the maps and info you will need.i love amsterdam and will definitely stay at the borgmann villa every time i return.

<Content>Unreservedly Recommended! My third visit since June 2005 to the above-named hotel has confirmed and consolidated the invariable excellence of its professional services and personal attention ensuring the comfort and well-being of all its guests.For the business visitor or tourist seeking accommodation near to the city centre but away from its crowds and noise the hotel is a pitch perfect choice. Overlooking the beautifully landscaped Vondelpark the location is tranquil and select ensuring peace and quiet throughout the day and night.Rooms are generously-sized and tastefully decorated offering every modern convenience and facility.The breakfast buffet is sumptuously in the Dutch style. Accommodation prices are remarkably competitive.There is a no-smoking policy which in a city where cigarette smoke blankets or obscures the interiors of many establishments is both appreciated and welcomed.Access to the major museums and Concertbouw are within 8-10 minutes walking distance through the park or by catching Tram 2 for four blocks. Dam Square is further along the route and reached in 10-12 minutes. I unreservedly recommend and endorse this polished gem among the hotels in Amsterdam.

<Content>Nice days in Borgmann Villa Hotel I spent some days in Borgmann Villa Hotel in Amsterdam in October, 2005 with my girlfriend and our litle boy (4 months old). Were very nice days in a quiet, clean Hotel. There was parking space for the car near the hotel and was easy to go to the center with our baby, by bus or walking through the nice Vondelpark. The people in the hotel were very kind.

<Content>Like being at Home I stayed in the Borgmann for an extended weekend with my wife. I know the hotels in Amsterdam pretty well, since I go there for work every month and I challenge you to find such a treat elsewhere: a cozzy hotel located in one of the nicest areas of Amsterdam, 20 minutes walk from the center, with such a thoughtful and nice staff, with a very reasonable rate. I felt like I was staying with relatives! The only caveat is the breakfast, which costs too much for what you get, even thought the view of the park may compensate for the difference. My wife caught a strong cold during our stay and the staff did everything they could to help us out: find a physician on a Saturday night, give us directions to the only pharmacy open and boil water for us every day, twice a day. Unheard of in any other hotel I stayed, besides the big 5 stars my company pays for me once in a while.

<Content>Peace and Quiet. This is a basic hotel with extremely steep staircases. It is, however, in a lovely setting with helpful hotel staff.The hotel is only a short tram trip away from all the activities in Amsterdam.There are plenty of good eateries nearby.I would give the Leidseplein area a miss,unless you are into 80's food. There are much better places to eat in Amsterdam.I would recommend this hotel as it is reasonably priced and quite central.

<Content>peaceful amsterdam We've been to amsterdam several times before (we are a couple of 47 years of age) and we tend to go for the lower to middle price range.The hotel is on the edge of the lovely Vondel Park about 10 mins walk, 5 mins cycle to the Ryjjk's museum. (You must get a bike to get around it's the only way to travel). The tram stop is literally round the corner. Next door is the British Counsel which is handy if you lose your passport. If you're driving there is always parking right outside for just 12 euros a day,cheap by Amsterdam's standards.So the hotel is small, about 25 rooms, clean,welcoming and quiet.The rooms are small but perfecly adequate for a short stay.There's no tea making facilities in your room which we would have liked. Breakfast is not included which we think should have been.If you want a lively place to meet people this is not the place for you but if want a place that feels safe and tranquil then try it.It's in a residential area with restuarants close by; also the main concert hall is just down the road.

<Content>Cozy Nook, That Stayed at the Borgmann Villa 4 days during a pristine Autumn with wife and 4 month old child. The hotel appears mansionlike and is modern, clean and nestled near an entrance to the Vondel Park. The manager, Gregory, was most pleasant, helpful, and very accomodating. A playpen was provided for the baby at no extra charge. There was no internet available, but Gregory let us check e-mails on his laptop with enthusiasm. Having read bad reviews of the breakfast, each morning we walked two short blocks to the Koninginnweg where a bakery and choclatier (Arti-Choc) shared an intersection. We purchased our breakfast and ate at the hotel in the small tree shaded yard abutting a stream which separates the yard from the Vondel Park. None of the other guests were using the yard, which was good because the yard is small.  The neigborhood is residential and quiet rather than touristy. Walking in the area was quite nice as a number of manses, including some Consulates, line the border of Vondel Park. However, the number 2 tram is just two blocks away and gets you downtown in about ten minutes. There is also a superb deli a five to ten minute walk south on the Koninginneweg. Grabbing inexpensive, high quality sandwiches and eating in the Vondel Park was a treat amid the expensive environs of Amsterdam. The bathroom was large and one could take a proper shower. Although slightly on the expensive side, I would not hesitate to stay here again, with or without a child.

<Content>Wonderful Staff! We stayed at the Borgmann Villa after reading previous reviews on TripAdvisor and we were very happy with our choice. My boyfriend and I found it very easy to get to from the #2 tram (a short walk from Emmastraat stop). We loved the location at the edge of Vondelpark, away from the noise of the city. The room was very clean with bright windows overlooking the street. On our last day at the hotel, we were supposed to catch an early flight and ww overslept that morning, thus missing our flight. The nice woman working at the desk really helped me out and let me use the phone and internet to arrange my new flight schedule. We had to stay in Amsterdam another night, but their hotel was fully booked that evening, so she called around to other hotels and found us a place a block away at a reasonable rate. I really appreciated all their patience and help during that stressful time. I highly recommend this hotel...truly a gem in Amsterdam!

<Content>A Hidden Hotel Gem of Amsterdam Borgmann Villa Hotel is a small, moderately-priced, charming, owner-operated/managed hotel in a quiet residential neighborhood bordering the southside of beautiful VondelPark in Amsterdam and is extremely convenient to the city's major entertainment and cultural areas. The hotel is only a two minute walk from the city tram system and car parking (for a daily fee) directly in front of the hotel (a rare commodity in Amsterdam) is available. The hotel has secured entry, but guests have access during all hours.I had two separate ocassions to stay at Borgmann Villa and both times I found the accomodations to be clean, bright, quiet and comfortable. Rooms are equipped with remote control TV, telephone, hairdryer, private bath and/or shower (with plenty of hot water) and a nicely stocked mini-bar. A continental-style breakfast buffet and Wifi internet connection are available for a nominal fee. I would suggest notifying the hotel in advance if you want Wifi service as some locations in the hotel have better signal reception than others, though.The friendly personal service and attention by the owners and small staff is exceptional... so much so that I found the hotel to be operated more as a bed  breakfast than a hotel. Upon check-in, as well as throughout my stay, I was updated on any sightseeing or special events that I might be interested in during my stay in Amsterdam.When I return to Amsterdam, I will definately be contacting Borgmann Villa Hotel for reservations!

<Content>Great location and friendly service My wife and I spent a week at this Hotel located adjacent to Vondelpark in Amsterdam. We had a very pleasant stay. The accommodations were good. Our room had large windows and it was light filled, especially during the afternoon when it was sunlit. It was very quiet at night enabling us to sleep well. The service was excellent, towels, etc. changed each day in an unobtrusive way. The staff was exceptionally helpful, answering our questions, providing directions, assisting us as we had a wonderful stay in Amsterdam. We used the tram frequently and a stop was only a few short city blocks away. We also walked through the park to the museum area containing the Van Gogh museum, the Rijksmuseum and the Concertgebouw. I would definitely stay in this hotel again should I be fortunate enough to visit Amsterdam again.

<Content>Nice room shame about the breakfast The hotel itself was great, the rooms were really clean and airy, nice bathrooms. Staff were pleasant.Whilst the hotel was not near the centre of Amsterdam it was only a fifteen minute walk through the park to get to Leides plein. It was really hot and sunny whilst we visited so it was lovely to spend time reading and lounging around in the park.The only thing that really let the place down were the breakfasts. We hadn't noticed when we booked that the breakfasts cost another ten euro on top of the room rate and we were only informed by the hotel on checking out.Luckily the breakfast was so bad on the first morning we spent there that we ate elsewhere for subsequent days and saved ourselves 60 euros (we were charged for the first day). The hotel had ran out of most things on the breakfast buffet and so I ended up paying 10 euros for a boiled egg and a coffee. It took twenty minutes to even get the coffee as the receptionist was dealing with both the food and guests checking out. The breakfasts were very basic and I mean very basic, no croissant, toast or anything similar, just sliced bread, ham, cheese and cereal, really bad value for money. The cafe across the road was cheaper and offered more. It seemed a real shame as the hotel was great and I'd have stayed again quite happily, however I think that by the time you add the price of breakfast to the room charge it works out expensive in comparison to other places. (I have stayed at the Schipol Hilton with breakfast included cheaper than this hotel.)

<Content>Recommended for those seeking the peaceful side of Amsterdam A good small hotel. I'd definitely stay here again. The location overlooking the Vondelpark is superb for peace and quiet - wake up to hear the birds singing rather than traffic. They also turn off the lift overnight to avoid disturbing people. Tram line 2 is five minutes away, then another 15 or so to get into the centre. The girl on reception was very friendly and helpful. I didn't bother with breakfast, preferring BagelsBeans, four stops away at 40 Van Baerlestraat - recommended. My single room was pretty compact but included ensuite shower/toilet/washbasin. Cleanliness was good for 3* but obviously not up to 4* (spotless) standard. My only bad points are as follows. (1) The bath towel showed signs of being dropped outside; it was covered in small bits of leaves. I could have asked for another one but I didn't notice until too late. The hand towel was fine. (2) The curtain could do with a lining to block out more light in the morning. (3) The pillow was on its last legs (4) There was no shower gel in the bathroom, only soap and shampoo. I don't want to over-emphasize the bad points though, because I went away very happy with the overall experience and doubtlessly some of them could have been rectified by reception. I only list them to inform other travellers.Conclusion: recommended for those seeking the peaceful side of Amsterdam, but on a budget.

<Content>The Reviews are True! My father, brother, and I spent a few days at the Borgmann Villa Hotel in Amsterdam this past May, 2005. We had rooms 21 and 22. We were welcomed with an armful of information about the city and received excellent assistance from the owners whenever we had a request. Our rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable. Room 21 had a view of the front street, a huge bathroom with shower and bath, and a mini-bar. Room 22 had a double bed and shower, and a mini-bar, and a side view of Vondel Park. The hotel has a lovely breakfast room overlooking a little garden with a view to the park. There is a charming little lift that accomodates two people with luggage at a time. We would have gladly stayed longer but the hotel was booked. Down the street we found several restaurants and a supermarket. The location is quaint and quiet. I highly recommend it.

<Content>A Quiet and Quaint Retreat in a City of Activity On a recent trip to the city of Amsterdam we came across a hotel that really made our stay a quiet and comfortable one. The Borgmann Villa Hotel is located right on the magnificent Vodel Park in the Museum Quarter of Amsterdam. Why we were glad that we found this hotel was the fact that we were looking for a retreat that we could come back to after a busy day of exploring the more bustling areas of the city. This was the perfect place to wind down after experiencing all the sights and sounds of Amsterdam. Tucked into a quiet neighborhood, the 10 minute walk to and from the hotel each day through the gorgeous Vondel Park provided us with a very scenic and peaceful way to begin and end each of our days. We also appreciated the size of our room and bathroom---larger than what we have experienced elsewhere in Europe at this rate. The owners of the hotel couldn't be nicer or more helpful, gladly answering our questions and making sure our stay was a good one. If you are looking for a place away from the noise and action of the city this is it.

<Content>Good value for money We spent 3 nights here in January 2005. The staff were friendly, but we had limited contact as we did not take breakfast at the hotel. The room and bathroom were really clean, warm and ours was quite spacious. The location of the hotel means it is quiet at night . It is close to the stop for the number 2 tram which will bring you close to almost everything in amsterdam. Alternatively a 15 minute walk through the Vondelpark will bring you close to the museumplein where there are many options for breakfast! For the price it was really good value and this made up for the fact that it is further out then other hotels.
