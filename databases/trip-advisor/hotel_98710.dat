<Content>Overall, pretty good I've stayed at the Renaissance on several occasions, for various purposes, and while I've never been overwhelmed, it's definitely a hotel I'd recommend.It's always clean, with attentive staff and speedy service. Parking is steep, but self-park is an option- and you don't have to cross any streets on foot to do it. This hotel is convenient to the hospitals, and just a couple of minutes from downtown Dallas.One of the reasons I rated this place above average is the breakfast. I don't usually have any other meals there, but the full-service breakfast is exceptional for the price.

<Content>Large rooms, great technology, friendly staff Outside, this oval-shaped high-rise building looks architecturally interesting. Inside, my room was large, clean and well optimized for the needs of the business traveller with an advanced electronics console (combining a power bar with jacks allowing a PC to plug into the TV, which was a large-screen flat-panel LCD unit). There is a good bar and decent restaurant in the hotel, important because there's not much around the property within walking distance (I could see central Dallas from my window, but in the distance as this hotel is on the way from DFW airport towards - but not in - the downtown area). Service was fast, friendly, and accurate. My room service breakfast was excellent, although the huge food portions of were larger than 鈥楾exas-sized.鈥?I also liked the combination clock radio and iPod bedside unit. A lot of hotels seem to be phasing-out radios, but this one was brand new and worked well.

<Content>Nothing Special After reading the reviews here I had high hopes for my stay at the Renaissance. The hotel is beautiful and well kept. The rooms and hallways are updated with nice fixtures and decorations. My room however was extremely small for the price. I've paid a lot less for larger room that was just as nice in Marriott properties. The staff was friendly and the business center was useful. There is free and valet parking available. I just wish the room would have been a more comfortable size. I will definitely try a different hotel on my next stay in Dallas.

<Content>Very Nice This Renaissance is very nice. My room was fresh and contained great appointments. I was upgraded to a suite, which had an amazing living room, complete with HDTV and very cool lamps.The best part of the stay, however, was breakfast. Their breakfast buffet is probably the best meal I've had in a Marriott hotel, hands down. They had these breakfast baguettes that were to die for. Yum!This hotel is also close to the Uptown area of Dallas, which is good for younger travelers who seek to experience Dallas nightlife.

<Content>Renaissance was great! My wife and I stayed at the Renaissance for Anniversary and it was wonderful. Definately suggest the package that includes dinner, champagne and breakfast. The pool is on the roof top thirty floors up and was great. Make sure to check out the observation deck. Room was very nice, newly updated with LCD televisions and nice decor. Dinner as TBones was as good as any high end steak house in town. Highly recommend the Renaissance.

<Content>Not what I paid for Nice hotel with a great staff, but the club level room rate is basically a rip off. The hotel website promises Marble and brass fixtures, we got chrome and Formica, they promise bathrobes, Starbucks coffee, and a CD player alarm clock, we never saw that, They offer our choice of Mineral water, chardonnay, or Merlot on arrival with chips and sauce or mixed nuts, never got that either.It was a nice room in a great hotel, but I feel like if I pay for something I should get it. I felt ripped off.

<Content>Wonderful Deal Here! In the middle of 2 night stay here, bid throug Priceline at $68 a night, which is a steal I think considering all this place has to offer. Travelocity rate was $109 which is still not a bad deal for this place.The hotel must have been renovated recently, my room on the 16th floor had awesome view, room is gorgeous, high end finishes everywhere, incredible king bed, great desk, nice furniture, TWO sinks, nice bathroom. Nice big flat screen TV. Room has a fridge (look in a bedside cabinet!) Found the coffeemaker in another cabinet. Self parking is FREE!! First time ever I've been to a major chain that free parking. Service here is OUTSTANDING, kudo to the mgmnt for trying so hard to please, it's obvious. Some nitpicks - Maid service was late in the day, I'm guessing it's because the hotel has a Mary Kay convention going on (lots of women in pink!) Also the Gym which I always use in hotels has some okay cardio equipment but otherwise is really very JackLalanne circa 1972. Pool is nice on the roof, hardly any lounges to lay on though. Also because it's so high they walled off the view I guess to keep drunken guests from falling off.Also, wifi is free in the lobby and public spaces, but in your room it's dial up (the room comes with a cable modem) Haven't seen that in a while.Direct TV service goes off every so often.Anyhow this place is great, wouldn't hesitate to come back or recommend.

<Content>Favorite Place to Stay in This Area This is my favorite place to stay in this part of the Dallas. I had a very nice, modern room (1510) with a beautiful night-time view of downtown Dallas in the distance... be sure you ask for a room on that side of the hotel. The room had the usual comfortable Marriott beds, a large flat screen TV, and a small sectional sofa in the corner instead of the usual chair.Staff throughout the hotel was friendly and responsive. I liked the all-purpose Delighted to Serve button on the phone. It made life a little easier.Room service at dinner was just adequate (club sandwich and tortilla soup). I'll be back... probably many times.

<Content>Booooooo Okay, this review is a little late. A lot late. But every time I drive by this hotel I remember what a let down it was, so I figured I might as well post.My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night, the day that we got married. It wasn't our honeymoon but it was our first night as a married couple. The hotel knew this and yet we still got a terrible, run-down room. It was dated, it was dingy -- I've stayed in a Motel 6 that was more modern and clean.The whole stay was just very sub-par. I had seen the hotel from the outside for years -- I called it the deodorant hotel because of it's unique shape -- and had always wanted to stay there.I remember that the bed was highly uncomfortable and that the hotel staff was far from pleasant.Maybe the hotel is under new management or maybe they got their act together, but personally I'll never go back.

<Author>Pulaskicountytourism
<Content>Nice but just some notes... Over all enjoyed my stay. Very clean. Staff was great and very friendly. The toliet wouldn't flush in my room but they fixed it within a couple of hours. Room was large.Be prepared, food is pretty pricey at T-Bones the steak/seafood restaurant in the lobby. But the food was very good. As far as I can tell there really isn't any other restaurants within safe walking distance, other than a Denny's I can just make out in the distance on past several large empty parking lots. Steaks run $30 on up (And I mean just the steak) Then you have to pay $8 for a potato, $8 for a salad, $6 for 6 aspargus spears $3 for a glass of tea...So be prepared. Atleast I haven't ate alot of carbs while on this trip.There is really nothing around close by (walking distance) except the convention center/market area and major roadways. There is some sort train that runs back and forth that you can hear in your room.Be sure to fly into Lovefield. Cab fares are under $20 but if you fly into the other airport you are looking at about $50.Another person mentioned the 2 flight climb to the pool area. The fitness area is up there too. It is a strange climb, metal stairs and such. Compared to all the granite and the italian chandelier it's a bit shocking to see this part of the hotel.Non smoking hotel which is fine. But what is nice they have a little patio area to the right of the front doors with tables and chairs.

<Content>Cheesy hotel (but a good value) The Renaissance Dallas is a throwback to the '80s, when I'm sure it was considered very glamorous. But today it feels very dated and more than a little run down in places.However, I got a rate of $109 per night through the hotel's Web site, which made it a good value. And as long as you have a car, the location is pretty great (close to downtown and Oak Lawn). They also have free parking; a bonus when compared to downtown hotels.The Renaissance has a lot of work to do if it wants to re-capture its youth. Nonetheless, it has some good things going for it.

<Content>Love This Hotel! My husband I have stayed here a few times. We love the view as well as the free breakfast. We are platinum members and usually always get a free upgrade without question. This is a fun relaxing place to spend a few hours of downtime. Room service is open until midnight, which is also nice. I love the larger King room! The work out room is a bit scary getting there, I don't recommend you go alone. But if you just want a very comfortable place to relax, and enjoy the view, I highly recommend the Renaissance Dallas Hotel.

<Content>Great hotel Had a fantastic weekend in Dallas and the Renaissance. Staff were really friendly and helpful and the view from the room was simply spectacular.You wouldn't walk from the hotel to downtown, but it's only a few minutes away by car.I was expecting a little bit of a dated hotel, but everything was in tip-top shape. Clean, comfortable and the staff make all the difference for me. They're happy to advise you on where to go and what to do.

<Content>Disappointing Stayed last night on visit. Location was fine as wanted close to American Airline Center. Room on 30th floor meant good view but we were back of hotel so no City lights. Good view from the roof top pool. Had wine in the room on arrival but was for someone else, we informed reception but took about 40 minues to collect and not even a thanks, should have drunk the wine! Decor in bedroom was a bit dated and room and corridors indicated hotel needed refurbishing. No bedding for sofa bed and took 2 attempts by room service to deliver, first time just gave us 1 sheet! Plus we needed to move the furniture for the bed to be extended. Breakfast was okay but again Marriott Suites was better. Hotel shuttle was fine for getting to Airline Center and picked us up after Texas Stampede. Overall disppointing as had expected to be of a higher standard than Marriott Suites but didn't match.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay We stayed for a long weekend coming from Washington, DC to see the Cowboys game during home opening weekend. The hotel is close to Texas Stadium and the West end area of Dallas. The hotel staff was very efficient and helpful. Hotel looks great from the outside and the lobby, bar and restaurant area had an upscale feel without being pretentious at all. The rooms are standard but very clean and it is nice to have two sink areas when staying with two people. The bed was very comfortable--down comforter and lots of pillows. TV is small. Room service offers a fairly good selection but as always, a bit pricey. We had a room on the 23rd floor and the view of downtown was great. Try Breadwinners cafe and bakery on McKinney for brunch or breakfast, its a great cafe/lunch place that tons of locals seem to frequent. You will have to wait but it was worth it. The only (-) of this hotel was that the lobby smelled strangely like beef. This is because of the steakhouse on the main floor but it is a weird combination of hotel cleaner smell mixed with beef every time you walk in....maybe they could get a better venting system in that restaurant. Other than that it was a great hotel and I would stay there again. Also--free parking. Get a rental car or you will feel isolated. Go Cowboys!

<Content>Granite and glass monolyth I had a 3 night mid-week stay.The bathroom was nice sized, but a few of the white towels had yellow stains. I wonder if they were yellowed from too much chlorine bleach something else? The bath in the first room wreaked like someone had dropped a bottle of cheap cologne. I had to leave.The next room was large with a good view of Dallas from the 28th floor. The AC worked great. (August in Dallas is blast furnace hot, and this year Amazon river basin humidity too) So the cool quiet AC was a blessing.I can't stand to watch the TV in these hotel rooms anymore with 5.1 HD at home.Antiquated grandmother's house best describes the decor in this sleek granite and glass monolith. So the inside does not match the exterior.Speaking of housekeeping : 1 day turn-down service, 2 days no turn-down service. 1 day newspaper, 2 days no paper. 2 days coffee for the coffee maker, one day no coffee, 2 days no cream. One day mouthwash, 2 days no mouthwash. Consistency would be nice. I wonder if I need to learn Spanish to tell them.Room service was slow.Seems like too many workers just standing around. I'm not sure that gets you 4 star quality. Maintenance man with a quizzical look was surfing the elevators one day. He said everything was OK.Super-sized security guards waddled the halls each evening, not sure what they could secure beyond another BigMac. It was strange to climb a couple of flights of stairs to get to the roof-top pool 32 floors up. I guess it keeps the fatties out .Scrambled eggs made with what tasted like old cooking oil and tasted terrible. Some of the staff had trouble with English. Who is doing the cooking? Yikes.All the many 3 and 4 star hotels I've been to in the Market Center area need a face-lift. The Westin downtown had a flat panel TV and updated interior and the Ren at MKT CTR is not as nice as the 3 star Hilton Anatole across the freeway either.

<Content>okay for price but renovations coming in Sept. Beautiful lobby. Marriott rewards offered a service to honor special requests for towels, pillows, reservations, etc., but ours were not honored upon arrival. I had to call desk 4 hours later. Bathroom vanity was cracked and the toilet leaked which explained the horrific B.O. smell. The only room to move to had no city view which my kids loved. From now on, I'll pack Lysol spray!We booked the bed and breakfast for an additional $10 which was well worth it because the bill for 5 breakfast buffets would have been $51. Without a breakfast deal, go to nearby Denny's or IHOP.Pool was horrible and freezing eventhough the front desk insisted the heater was on. Cigarette butts were all in the pool!VERY convenient to West End, Galleria, historic district, etc. especially via the tollway.With all the options in Dallas, I won't choose this one again. We changed our reservations for Sept. to another 4 star since the Ren. is starting major renovations in Sept. - beware.

<Content>It was decent The Renaissance is a very pretty, centrally located hotel. The lobby and restaurant are both very nice.The rooms themselves were decent, although the bathrooms are sorely in need of a remodel. Both me and another business companion found the bathtubs to be dirty (they may be stained). But the bathtubs at motel 6's have always looked nicer then here.The staff is very helpful and friendly, and the cafe downstairs is good for coffee in the morning. Another negative is that the Renaissance feels a need to gouge you on prices for little things. Internet is $10 a day, although it is fast and works well. Don't expect to save money buying water in the lobby, they only sell $4.33 Norwegian artesian water (Tastes like tap water to me).

<Content>Top Notch!! Great hotel inside and out, in a not so nice area. However you are only a few minutes by car to downtown Dallas and restaurants.** I would not recommend staying here without a car or you may feel isolated, as cabs do not just hang around the places you may travel to around here**Very professional staff and rooms are wonderful. Someone else paid so value for price for me was great!!

<Content>Great Hotel Experience Enjoyed my stay at the Renaissance Hotel in Dallas, TX. The room was comfortable and the bed was too. The pillows could've been a littler firmer, but overall it was a good hotel. The room was clean. The pool area was a little crowded (on the 30th floor of the bldg) with hardly any space. Staff was friendly and helpful. The restaurant in the hotel was also very good. My only complaint was that I could hear the neighbors next door at 5am--it was a loud and an interesting awakening.

<Content>Beautiful hotel This beautiful hotel is close enough to downtown with easy access to all the major freeways throughout the metroplex. The new beds are incredible and the rooms are nice. The parking leaves a little to be desired, but it was adequate. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool was very warm and the terrace offered great views of the Dallas skyline. Altogether another wonderful Marriott experience.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel is near the Market Center and Love Field and isn't far from the down town area, making it very convenient. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the door men know you after staying there one time. The bedding is comfy with down covers and pillows. There is an extra sink and mirror which is great for two people sharing a room. It is clean and they are generous with bathroom linens. The view is beautiful at night if you are high enough and facing downtown. The T-Bones Steak Restaurant is very good whether you are eating a full meal, or prefer a salad and soup. Their tortilla soup is wonderful. I would definitely recommend this hotel for any one traveling alone or with business partners.

<Content>Heavenly Beds We were in Dallas for only one night and were fortunate to have chosen the Renaissance Dallas Hotel. It is a 30-floor granite tower with the pool and gym on the 30th floor -- what an incredible view! The hotel has been well maintained with immaculate housekeeping. The furniture looks new, the carpets are clean and there were plenty of soft bath towels. The pillow-top mattress on the Kingsize bed was heavenly with feather pillows or foam on request and down comforter (duvet). The staff was friendly and responsive. We especially appreciated the free Starbucks coffee and coffeemaker in the room. Due to its location on the edge of downtown, a car is a necessity -- unless you have business at the Dallas Market Center which runs a free shuttle bus. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Dallas.

<Content>Better than I could have imagined My wife and I stayed at the Renaissance Dallas Hotel while it town one weekend. I LOVED IT!! this property is everything it promotes itself to being. The lobby was inviting and the staff very friendly. The room was immaculate with very comfortable beds. We also had a great view of downtown Dallas. This stay was a treat and we will be back

<Content>Very relaxing stay. Great hotel. Reasonable priced. We stayed 2 night just to get away from home since we live locally. Room was very nice. Wife loved the bed. Room service was fast. Only ate breakfast at the restaurant so can't rate the food. Pool was not the best. A little dirty and the chlorine was too high. Pool is on the roof top so it is windy up there. Hot tub did not get hot even after 1.5 hours of being on. It is a 5 minute drive to downtown but one cannot walk to downtown which could be important to some travellers. Overall good but need a few improvements.

<Content>A nice hotel, but overbooked I stayed at this hotel last week and was overall pleased, but there were some problems. The front desk staff was marginally helpful - I was waiting outside for a cab and they were complaining about customers in front of other guests. The hotel was full so there was about a 3 elevator run wait in the mornings and evenings. The room was nice - wonderful pillows. My wake-up call was late (and I had to catch a flight) - luckily I also set my cell phone alarm. The hotel bar is very nice but expensive, the pool is on the roof (about the 31st floor) so it was very windy, the internet was very quick but there was a $9.95 charge per day. I would stay here again but it was not outstanding - the hotel is just getting older...

<Content>Great Deal/Nice Property Just returned from a weekend at the Renaissance. Was very impressed by the room and service. Especially for the price. Booked a weekend special that included a 2 room suite, King Bed, and full Breakfast. Price was $139. Service was great and friendly. When I say breakfast, I mean the whole thing..made to order omelettes, fresh fruit including kiwi/boysenberries,(not canned peaches). Great exercise room. Small rooftop pool. Would definitely return and feel any rate below $160 to be very good.

<Content>Pick another hotel in Dallas (with caveat) This hotel is below average - especially for Texas! For the business traveler; 'Stay On-Line' internet service is awful, though the hotel staff is very agreeable to giving a new code when the one you're assigned rejects your log-in!If you're staying here, get a car. The hotel is in the middle nowhere (restaurants, shopping, convenience stores) but the taxi drivers are nice, and will take you anywhere! Bellstaff and Concierge are also helpful. Bar-staff seems to be very socialable - with each other! New patrons are ignored for a good five minutes, before they are acknowleged. Draft beer taps were off all week!The rooms need a serious re-facing (sinks, tubs) and a dirty towel and pillow grossed me out (though both replaced promptly - and without attitude!) It was almost as if the staff expected the negativity; and were happy to fix the problem!On a good note: the food is good! The steak salad in the Lobby Bar was awesome, and I (personally) loved the med-RARE angus burger available in room service. Texans are not weird about how you like your beef!Oh, one more thing; the hotel is close to a rail line, so if train whistles bother you, ask to stay on the other side of the hotel!

<Content>Enjoyed the Renaissance I recently spent one night at the Renaissance Dallas. I enjoyed the stay. The service was excellent. I'm a Marriott Rewards Platinum level guest, which entitles me to an upgraded room. That doesn't always get taken care of before all the suites are filled with other guests. In this case, though, the front desk blocked me out an upgraded room ahead of time, and I had a wonderful suite with a skyline view. They seemed very willing to accomadate requests, Platinum or not. Check in was very smooth, despite a 2AM arrival. The one meal I had was very good. I would agree with the previous comments that there's not much around other than other hotels. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Outdated hotel Stayed at the Renaissance Dallas for a conference. Check-in was quick. I had a small corner room with a view of Downtown Dallas. Size was okay considering I was traveling by myself. Non-smoking room had a smoky smell. Decorations in room and bathroom were very outdated. The bar on the first floor was decent. Be careful of food. Not sure if it was the food our conference organizers ordered, but the main meals were awful. Snacks were good. On the second day of the conference, I knew to load up during snack time since the main meals were a toss-up.

<Content>The Renaissance is not a tourist destination This hotel was really nice, but there was NOTHING around within walking distance. It is located within a cluster of other hotels so there must be a reason for this, but I couldn't figure it out. It must be for business travellers. The chips and salsa at the bar were incredible! Yum! The breakfast bar was good, but it was $15/person. Try to get a room rate with breakfast included. Our room was rather small, but the view was breathtaking from the 19th floor. They even had nice Bath and Body Works shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. It's rare to even have conditioner supplied to you at a hotel. I was impressed, but it doesn't take much. If I am ever in Dallas again for businees, I would stay here. If I was there to sight see, I would find a different location.

<Content>Great Time at the Renaissance This hotel is very user-friendly. Staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. The room is clean and comfortable. The only complaint is overhead lighting in the room; however this was not a problem in the daytime when we opened our draperies on the 10th floor. 2 minutes away from the American Airlines Arena, great restaurants are close. Will be staying here again.
