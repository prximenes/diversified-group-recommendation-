<Content>Excellent hotel - Outstanding Service! I travel extensively for business and leisure. I have Hilton Diamond VIP and always stay at the Conrad Hilton in Hong Kong when on business. This time, for a family vacation, made more geographical sense to look for alternative hotel location. Selected the Langham Place based on reviews here. Excellent choice for a change! Outstanding service from all staff during our 5-day stay over the Christmas period - courteous, friendly, very professional. Very good property, good location if you are a tourist (however, relatively far from financial/business centre), good food. Refreshing to NOT have to complain or be disappointed about something. 10/10!

<Content>Love it! Love it! Love it! A very belated review I'm afraid but my husband and I were on our honeymoon. We stayed in a Club room which was just gorgeous with a small kitchenette (with mini bar), lovely bathroom, massive bed and plasma tv and a separate living room with plasma tv. The views over Hong Kong were stunning. Our room was clean, tidy, very comfortable at all times. Being in a Club room meant we had access to the Club lounge where you take your breakfast, can sit and relax (free massage chairs with a huge tropical fish tank you can stare at while you're being massaged!!) and use of the internet is free of charge. Every day, there are special 'hours' in the Club lounge where you can have afternoon tea and snacks and cocktails (made to order) and canapes in the evening and it's all completely free so you can eat and drink to your heart's content. It's all delicious!Our breakfast was absolutely fantastic with a stunning view over Hong Kong as you ate. The staff in the Club area are just gorgeous. So friendly and efficient and nothing is too much trouble for them. Everyone has a smile for you. Downstairs, you have full access to the spa and gym. In the separate changing rooms are small steam rooms and jacuzzi's as well as showers - this area is luxurious, clean and tidy. There is also a beauty salon where I had some treatments done. THe staff are wonderful, friendly, efficient and you can't help leaving with a smile from the experience of it all.For dinner, there are several restaurants to choose from as well as bars. All were always busy and lively. Adjoining the Hotel is the Shopping Mall!! it's wonderful and plentiful and right on your doorstep!This Hotel is fantastic and we've made it a point to stay in more Langham Hotels now. Enjoy!

<Content>Lovely hotel hidden in midst of Hong Kong! I usually stayed at the tiresome Shangri La and Sheraton in Kowloon for my business trips to Hong Kong. After much complaint made to my colleagues in Hong Kong, they decided to have me stay in Langham Place in Mong Kok. The place is so much better than I thought. All the amenities are modern from room setting to the entertainment in the room, it's definitely a change of pace for me since I've been staying at Shangri La and Sheraton in Kowloon which compared to this place is definitely worlds apart with the same price range.There is also a really nice size lounge one floor above the reception area and not too much of a scene which I really liked and the food in the lounge is also really decent.This is kind of hotel that should be recommended for all business travelers!

<Content>Great Stopover choice We stayed 3 nights on a stopover break from New Zealand. The location of the hotel is great, right next to a large shopping mall with direct access to the MTR. We could not fault the staff who were always available to answer any query. We went on the hotel free 1 hour evening guided tour of local markets which was informative. The pool was excellent with wonderful views over Hong Kong skyline. Ask for a high room for wonderful views - this hotel would not be good for guests suffering from vertigo! The glass wall between the en-suite bathroom and bedroom was a bit of a shock until we realised there was a blind to pull down! The restaurant and bar are expensive but very good. Plenty of other eating options in the adjacent shopping mall.We had a 5am departure and ordered breakfast in our room at 4.15am, it arrived bang on time and beautifully presented. We would not hesitate to stay at this lovely hotel again.

<Content>Fantastic Christmas at the Langham Place. My wife and I spent our Christmas and New Year holiday at the Langham Place and it was the best ever. Even though it was three years since we last stayed here there was note welcoming us back. We stayed a total of nine nights and booked the Sweet Place on the 36th floor at the club level. It was well worth it for the extra room space and inclusive club benefits and facilities. Everything about the hotel was first class. The service, staff, room and food were all excellent and although some reviewers were a little unhappy about the location of the hotel we really didn鈥檛 find it an inconvenience at all. We always felt very safe when walking in the streets around the hotel and the MTR and all of the Kowloon / Hong Kong public transport links are superb. Even at it鈥檚 busiest on Christmas and New Years Eve it was really very easy to get around. Buy an Octopus card, it automatically deducts the fare as you go and can be used on just about all public transport including the Peak Tram, Star Ferry and even for small purchases in some convenience stores. It is simple to top it up and the small deposit and outstanding balance is refundable.The whole Langham Place experience from the moment we took the pre-booked hotel car on our arrival to our departure from Hong Kong airport was superb. All of the Langham Place staff at the airport and throughout the hotel were exceptional, I really can鈥檛 say enough good things about them. The hotel is great value for five star in Hong Kong and I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>AWSOME!! Very modern hotel. Rooms are quite big per Hong Kong standards. Makes your stay feels very comfortable. They have phases like Nice to have you when you checked in and phases (on envelope and cards in the room) that says Miss you already. They have even put our names on their IP phones to make it very personalised.Nice, Clean, Beautiful and absolutely one of the best hotel in Hong Kong.

<Content>Greatly disappointed My hubby and I first stayed at Langham Place Hotel in July 2007 for four nights. We were very happy with the Hotel's service and room that we went home and raved about it. We even recommended friends and colleagues to stay at the Hotel when they planned for trips to HK. The Hotel had created a lasting impression on us.Our next trip to HK was in Aug 2008. Naturally, we decided that we wanted to stick with Langham Place Hotel for our two nights of accommodation. We were slightly disappointed when the room that greeted us was older than the last one but everything else was fine. So, we decided that an older room would not dampen our spirits.Our last trip to HK was Dec 2008 and of course, it had to be Langham Place Hotel. Unfortunately, all the standard rooms were booked and blocked when we made our reservation nearly two months before our trip. Not ready to give up our favourite Hotel for another one, we decided to splurge on a deluxe room or what the Hotel called an Essential Place room for three nights. It would definitely be worth it, we thought. After all, we were getting a rain shower and 42 plasma flat screen TV. We even requested for a King-sized bed like we always did.However, our happy relationship with the Hotel encountered its first hiccup when the receptionist told us that our room was not ready. It was almost 3 pm. They were experiencing full house, she said, but she could give us a room with a great view...and twin beds just for that night. I was stumped and I rejected her offer. After all, I made my reservation months ahead. Full house or not, a guest expected to be given her room when it was her turn to check in.And we finally did check in after more than an hour but this time it was a Queen-sized bed instead of a King-sized bed. I requested for another change. A lady from the front desk popped by to give us our new card keys and simply walked off, leaving us to wonder what to do with the old card keys. Finally we settled down in a new room with a faulty TV remote control. We told the receptionist about it and she was supposed to send someone to fix it but nobody came.We encountered another obstacle in our relationship when we requested for two pillows from the Pillow Menu the next evening. Of course they were not available because the Hotel was having a full house. The receptionist said she would note down my request and bring me the pillows the following evening if they were available but they did not appear on our last night. Neither did anyone bother to inform us that the pillows were not coming.On the day of check-out, we waited in the queue for almost 15 minutes for our turn. Finally, a counter was free but the gentleman refused to attend to more guests. So he kept his eyes glued on his screen, occasionally looking at his colleagues on his left and right from the corner of eyes and stealing glances at the queue in front of him. He probably felt that he had attended to too many guests over the past few minutes and so, it was time for his colleagues to catch up with the number. I was fuming as we had a plane to catch. Finally, another receptionist was available and it took only a minute to complete our check-out. She did not request for our feedback on our stay, unlike previously when the Hotel was eager to find out how it fared.The relationship came to a rude end when a bell boy refused to acknowledge our presence and our huge luggage at the level one entrance. We needed to catch a cab urgently to the airport and I was trying to get the bell boy's attention but he ignored me. His attitude was shocking as we had never ever encountered a staff who was so rude during our stay at the Hotel. Where was the Hotel that we used to love? Where were the warm staff whom we thought so highly of?After a few minute, the bell boy finally asked me where we were going and I told him. No, he did not smile. In fact, none of his colleagues at the entrance were friendly. When it was our turn to board the cab, he asked me again where were were heading without making eye contact. By this time, I was simply too stunned to do anything else but repeat my destination. He remained expressionless. When we boarded the cab, the driver asked us where we were heading! Obviously, the bell boy asked us for our destination twice and still did not tell the driver where we were going! What was that about?Langham Place Hotel might have established a good reputation when it was launched, one that was good enough to help it top the TripAdvisor choice hotel chart for a long time. However, it has started to become very complacent. I was surprised when it was ousted from its top position on the chart but now I think it deserves it.

<Content>TripAdvisor reviews didn't let me down! What previous reviews have said were true! This hotel deserves to be on the very top list of Hong Kong. The room was very well decorated and with a little integration of technology has made it a whole lot better. The only bad thing is that internet is not free.The CISCO IP Phone thing that they have is actually quite fun to play with. Did you know that you can text (SMS) anyone in the world from that phone for free? This made my meeting with friends in Hong Kong a whole lot cheaper and easier. This was the first time that I didn't have to buy a local prepaid SIM card because of this functionality.Fitness center was very awesome. Loved the views. You should go there even if you are not planning to work out.. just for the view.As you know, it's right on top of an MTR subway station and it's only three stops away from main shopping area, Tsim Sa Tsui.Free internet at 5th Fl at Portal is quite disappointing to me. I was there during Xmas 09 and there was not enough machines! And I found out that some machines actually blocked the access to Facebook and some other websites which I don't know why. Later when I used the iMac it was fine, no blocks... strange.The shopping mall next to the hotel has the longest escalator I have ever seen in my whole life. Also, shopping there is also a great idea if you are bored at night. During Xmas, stores close even after midnight. That's what I love about Asia/Southeast Asia!Staff were very friendly. We wanted to try new places to eat but most of the places were full and had to prebook (bc it's Xmas), staff recommended a place called Goungzhou Garden in that shopping mall on the 3rd Fl. Wow the food at that place was amazing! It's Chinese food but it's also more like a fusion Chinese food more suitable for those who comes from Southeast Asia or Australia I'm sure. Should give it a try.Over all, a perfect place if you don't mind the crowd at the MTR station.

<Content>Great location at reasonable rate for luxury hotel The Langham is a luxury hotel at a very reasonable rate. It's a very short walk to the subway that quickly and cheaply takes you anywhere you want to go in Hong Kong. There is a nice breakfast buffet every morning and a lovely pool on the roof of the building. Our room had a great view of the city, Hong Kong island, and the harbour.The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was the upsell. It was distasteful to stay at a 5-star and get an upsell for everything but the room you've already paid for. That said, we would stay here again without hesitation.

<Content>High Tech High Touch Hotel This newer high rise hotel in the Mong Kok district prides itself on high tech features like a CISCO smartphone and little touches like a doorbell and tasteful lights outside your door that indicate if you don't want to be disturbed or, conversely, would like the room made up. What surprised us, though, was the fact that one entire wall of the bathroom, which ran along the tub and faced the bed, was clear glass! Is this so you can watch TV while you bathe - or is it intended for more interpersonal visions? (A shade on one side and blinds on the other allows you to make your own decisions.)Staff were uniformly helpful, often walking with us in the direction we needed to go rather than just pointing the way. Although located outside the harbor area, the hotel is connected to a large shopping center (which includes a grocery store) and a subway stop which made travel throughout the area quite easy.My only disappointment was that you have to pay extra for in-room WIFI - although there is free internet access in the Portal - Work and Play  area. If your room doesn't have a good view, be sure to take in the open pool area on the 42nd floor rooftop. Stunning.

<Content>Lovely rooms, friendly staff My husband, daugher and I rented two Club rooms, which were great. Wonderful, comfortable beds, clean modern rooms, although not the largest we've ever stayed in. Bathroom also was new - wonderful shower with both rainbird and hand held shower fixtures, plenty of hot water, good water pressure. Also the heat/air conditioning worked well. (The three absolutes for a good hotel room - good pillow, good shower, ability to regulate the room temperature.) Paying for a room on the top floors with access to the club was more expensive but well worth it. The concierge there was very helpful. There was always something good to eat available (they have breakfast, tea, cocktails and a dessert time), it had ready computer access and was quite comfortable after walking around the packed streets of Hong Kong. You have the choice of breakfast in the club or downstairs, with the downstairs breakfast much more elaborate, with plenty of choice of food. Know, however, that everything is cleared promptly at the time they say breakfast ends. We arrived at the hotel late in the evening and left mid- morning - both times used the limo service, and again, although there was cost involved, we found it was worth the money. The location isn't the best - most americans don't stay in kowloon, we were told by local ex-pats we met, and they refer to it as the dark side,- but we found it convenient to the underground and easy to get where we wanted to go. We also wanted a more traditional experience, rather than a purely touristy one. We didn't visit the market there but did another several blocks away - mainly inexpensive but not terribly impressive goods. The attached shopping mall is exactly that - a fairly traditional shopping mall. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Perfect start to a perfect honeymoon My husband and I stayed at the Langham Place for 2 nights at the start of our honeymoon. We could not have picked a better hotel!From the minute we arrived we felt so well looked after, the staff could not do enough to help us.We upgraded to a Club room which we were so pleased about-the facilities available helped make our stay so enjoyable. Drinks and snacks are available all day and they have champagne available in the evening. We chose to have breakfast in the main restaurant rather than in the Club room due to the huge choice available. There was everything you could imagine-fresh omlettes, hot Asian and Western choices, pastries, loads of fresh exotic fruit, meats, cheeses and loads more including a chocolate fountain! We especially loved the choices of fresh juice too.One of the reasons we loved the hotel so much was due to its location in what felt like 'real' HK-the streets surrounding it are really busy and lively, much different to the financial area which felt very Western. The Ladies Market is only a few streets away and is really interesting to wander round. The underground station is inside the shopping centre that the hotel is attached too which makes travelling around the city really easy.The hotels leisure facilities are also top notch, we used the gym and pool most days to relax and were not dissapointed. The rooftop pool in the evening is particularly lovely.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone no matter what your reason for being in HK.

<Content>Splendid! Langham Place Cowloon was a brief stay in heaven. The service was incredible. The cleanliness and decor was outstanding. The restaurant was fantastic. The spa! The space was gloriously tranquil and amazingly equipped. The rooftop pool area was a marvelous little getaway in the city with it's comfy furniture and excellent bar service. Walking into Langham Place with their warm and helpful greeters was better than any hotel I've been in. Langham Place is worth every effort to stay.

<Content>New safe Quality Hotel in HK for me Changed hotel in HongKong after having read comments from other Tripadvisor visitors.No regret at all contrarely the best price /quality /service i had since i travel to HK (12 years for business).Make sure you upgrade for the Executive club lounge saving early evening drinks and starters for dinner(if you want) but this than much more relaxed and of high value and quality.Used the Boardroom for a two day meeting,just and just more than what you need,all perfectly well organized and controlled.Langham Place is my new business hotel from now onwards in Hongkong .Did not had the time to explore suroundings but the better i can conclude on the hotel and his facilities.

<Content>Very Bad service Usually when you book a top rated hotel from this site you get good value for money. Not this time! Booked prime room for me girlfriends birthday. tried to check in at 4 and they said we could not check in until 5.30! When you pay over 2500HK for a room you at least want to spend some time in it!. Eventually they told us we can't have that room and we had been upgraded. Sadly tho the room we were upgraded to was downgrade! Also housekeeper barged in after 30 mins of arrival to clean room (it had been cleaned 30mins previously) and were disturbed by a bellboy trying to give us a bucket of ice that we hadn't ordered. Other people at check in seemed to had same problem about room not being ready. Me and the girlfriend laughed it all off but seriously tho the service was worse than terrible!

<Content>Very Nice 5 Star! This is a very nice 5 star hotel in the middle of Kowloon, Hong Kong. I booked a weekend special direct with the hotel and the cost was $365 for 2 nights with taxes and service. Ask for a high floor with a harbor view, which they will give you if available. Free internet available on the 5th floor. Super nice gym available on the 46th floor.....if nothing else go there for the sunrise and sunset views! Rooms slightly small, but very well appointed, shade and blinds available to provide privacy between the bathroom and bedroom area-no problem with glass partition. Staff very accomodating. Hotel connected to very nice shopping center with stores, food court, and supermarket.

<Content>Good value for a hotel of this quality This hotel was by far the cheapest 5 star hotel I have ever stayed in.In my opinion it does not have the comfort level of say the Shangri-La or Conrad but doesn't have the rate card either.The area the hotel is in is not the best and I think this is reflected in the price. I also quite like a view of the harbour when in HK.However, the rooms  cleanliness can't be faulted  the staff are excellent. I would be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Phenomenal....... I booked Langham Place for a three night romantic getaway for my partner and I and from the moment we stepped inside the hotel, our expectations were far exceeded and we couldn't have been more impressed by both the service and factilities on offer. While we're both experienced travellers we easily rate this hotel as the best we have stayed in and would recommend Langham Place to anyone who wants to experience the modern and traditional Hong Kong combined (it's location in Kowloon is nestled between funky local markets and a short distance from Hong Kong Island).The building itself is tall to say the least which means that many of the rooms have amazing views. The rooms are adequate in size and have a boutique feeling with their glass bathroom walls.The hotel has three or four restaurants which are fairly good value for money when you consider the quality of the food and service but not cheap by any means. There are however, many places to eat on the door step.The on-site Chuan Spa is also wonderful if you want to treat yourself.

<Content>Another positive review I have to concur with previous reviewers. This was a wonderful hotel. The staff was exceptionally good. We had booked 6 days at the Langham and had booked 5 days in Macau. After speaking with other travellers, they said that we should only spend two nights in Macau. After hearing that, we changed our booking in Macau and booked the Intercontinental in Hong Kong for the extra nights. Just to show how muuch we did not want to leave the Langham, we cancelled the Intercontinental and spent the extra days at the Langham. This hotel really felt like a home away from home. There was only one unfriendly person the whole time we were in Hong Kong and she was the person cooking eggs in the Langham restaurant. For a city of millions of people, that's pretty impressive.

<Content>Super modern hotel in a crazy neighborhood (in a good way) LOVED this hotel. Not cheap but not a bad deal for what you get. Super modern, well designed rooms complete with full electronic gear and awesome views (the hotel rooms start high up and it's the tallest building around).Some people may avoid because the Mong Kok location is out of the way. I liked it -- TONS of action all around the hotel, but only steps to the subway and also atop a handy mall. Much less sterile than Central, but still very safe and close to everything.I would definitely stay here on any future visits to HK.

<Content>It was amazing! I've stayed in LHP twice, once last year and another time this year.. I can't start to say how much I love the place. I could live there forever..! I love the bathrooms!! The rooms are big and clean, compared to other hotels in HK that I've stayed in and the staff are really nice and helpful. It helps that the location is great too.. right next to the shopping mall and mong kok, where I can run out in the night to do a little bit more late night shopping. For a good hotel, the price is absolutely reasonable as well. The langham breakfast is scrumptious as well.. If you have the chance, you really should try it!

<Content>Life of luxury The Langham Place is a fantastic place to stay, I've never experienced such politeness and customer service. The staff are incredibly helpful, very welcoming and polite and nothing seems to be too much trouble. We spent 2 nights here on the way to Aus and booked a King size room which was fantastic. The standard rooms appeared a bit on the small side from the glimpses that we saw of them but I'm sure the other facilities in the hotel would make up for this. The Gym is great as is the spa area and the pool. The Mong Kok area is an interesting if somewhat hectic place to stay but hey that's the case everywhere in Hong Kong, don't expect to walk anywhere in a hurry, this is the most populated area on the planet and it certainly feels like that when you take what should be a 20 minute walk down to Victoria Harbour; don't expect to do it in less than 40 minutes.We would definately stay here if we travelled to Hong Kong again and would recommend to anyone to do the same.

<Content>We will return We stayed for 3 nights at the Langham Place over a weekend. We thought it to be the best hotel we have stayed in and we will definitely return to it, if we ever go back to Hong Kong.The staff was very polite. It is really nice to be greeted by everyone you meet. We were offered an upgrade for a small fee when we checked in and I'm happy we took it. Got a higher floor, bigger bathroom and a better bed for HKD200 a night.Breakfast was excellent, so were the other restaurants. Location was good, shopping and MTR station right at your feet. If you prefer McDonald's and Pizza Hut to fine dining, both are a two-minute-walk away.Toiletries were of very nice quality.View from our 31st floor room was breathtaking.Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!

<Content>The reality exceeds the hype! Summary:The reality exceeds the hype! The Langham Place was fantastic - we rate it as one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. When and why we stayed:We stayed for 7 nights in November 2008 鈥?we were in Hong Kong for a holiday.Cost:The room was booked as part of an Air New Zealand package. Room:We stayed in a Club L room (3523) on the 35th floor of the hotel. The room wasn鈥檛 huge but the Blissful Bed was 鈥?it was also extremely comfortable. The room contained: a gigantic high definition plasma television 鈥?look out for Smart Angel Tracie; a dvd player; Ipod docking station; free to use safe; and free WiFi. The bathroom had both a tub and shower cubicle. A vast array of complimentary bathroom goodies including: toothbrushes, razors and shaving cream, as well as shampoo, shower gel and bath crystals, was replenished each day. Dressing gowns and slippers were also supplied. Free bottles of water were also left each day by the professional housekeeping service. The turn down service left delicious squares of 鈥楲鈥?embossed chocolate each evening. A complimentary copy of the very-readable South China Morning Post was delivered each morning.The Hotel: The Langham Place was fantastic! We rated it as one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at (alongside Borgata in Atlantic City and Wynn Las Vegas), but it ranks even higher than even those two fine establishments for quality of customer service. From check-in to departure we were treated wonderfully, all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, and nothing we asked for was too much trouble. I was dubious about paying extra for a Club L room with gives access to the lounge. My apprehension was misplaced - I was glad we took up the offer. The Club L lounge has great views of Hong Kong, separate check-in (brilliant after a long flight), served free drinks (coffee, wine, beer and spirits plus champagne for two hours daily). Also provided were: afternoon tea (3PM 鈥?5:30PM); canap茅s - a different selection each day (6PM 鈥?8PM); and 鈥渟weet treats鈥?(8PM 鈥?10PM). This food was so good and plentiful that some evenings we didn鈥檛 have need to go out for dinner.Location: The Langham Place is in Mong Kok, a short journey on the efficient and chief MTR subway from most of the city鈥檚 leading tourist attractions 鈥?the station is below the hotel (we found entrance/exit E1 to be most convenient for the hotel. Mong Kok itself is a fascinating district 鈥?we felt totally safe wandering its claustrophobic and crowded streets, browsing the ladies and goldfish markets, enjoying the street smells and spectacle. The city:In our opinion, Hong Kong is one of the greatest (and most crowded) cities on planet Earth. Highlights of our stay included:Happy Valley races 鈥?this was a brilliant night out. We dined at the track鈥檚 Moon Koon restaurant (the set meal - over-priced at 拢25 a head). After our meal we watch the night鈥檚 entertainment from the public stands, which was a much-enhanced experience.The views from Victoria Peak 鈥?reached by Peak Tram, which reminded us of the San Francisco cable cars 鈥?the ascent is almost vertical in places. There are stunning views from the summit 鈥?make sure you visit on a clear day for the best pictures.A day-trip to the nearby casino resort of Macao, reached by a fast and smooth boat journey. We visited the MGM Grand, Wynn Macao, Landmark and The Venetian, which is even bigger than the Las Vegas original and is even home to a Manchester United store. During our trip we also visited:Lots of shopping malls! At least they all had a coffee place where husbands could chill out whilst wives shopped.Stanley 鈥?a seaside village on the south of Hong Kong Island 鈥?reached by taking the number 6 bus 鈥?beware the journey is more like a roller coaster ride.路The Museum of History 鈥?whose eight galleries present the fascinating and interesting Hong Kong Story 鈥?from geological creation to 1997鈥檚 reunification with China.Feel free to contact me if you require further information.

<Content>Perfect location for 1st time visitors Going to Hong Kong for the 1st time can be a bit daunting and if you're looking for the perfect place to situate yourself, then the Langham fills the bill. It's at the heart of Kowloon and close to malls, trains and ferries. The staff are of the highest standard and can't do enough for you, right down to the chambermaids.There are some terrific restaurants in the building and for a transplanted American living in Belfast, the NY Deli was a great surprise and truly welcomed. Make sure you take one night to visit the Aqua Club in the building across the street (1 Peking Rd). It's on the 29th floor and gives a spectacular view of HK harbour along with great cocktails and fantastic food.Overall, the Langham is definitely one of the best hotel I've ever stayed in and would gladly go back if the opportunity arises.

<Content>Incredible Value For Money Stayed for three nights in a standard room. As with other reviews, found the hotel to be excellent - the room was spacious, the bathroom fantastic and the bar excellent. Given the rate, it was incredible value for money.If you are wondering why it is so much cheaper than other properties in Hong Kong, I assume it is due to the location, in Mongkok about 2 miles from the ferry terminal. But dont let that put you off, it is only 4 stops on the MTR or 拢5 in a taxi back to the island. Mongkok itself may be traditionally working class but it is very safe, the hotel is attached to a modern shopping mall and the local market is fantastic for cheap / replica goods.In summary, stay here and spend the money you save on drinks at the Intercontinental bar!

<Content>The Best Hotel in the World? My boyfriend and I only stayed here for one night on our way back to London for the Phillipines. I wish I could have stayed forever!This is without doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The service was first class, discreet, simply spot on. It's definitely worth booking a club room, the views from Club L and the facilities are superb. We had a complimentary late check out, and use of Club L facilities (food and drink, internet, entertainment, .assage chairs...) right up until we left for the airport.The rooms are stunning, plenty of room, state of the art facilities.The bed was incredible, the sheets even better! The pool and spa need to be seen to be believed. Location wise, the hotel is great, it was good to see HK from Kowloon side, plus you're right next to the markets.Just go there! I'll certainly be going back!

<Content>An excellent experience, perfect value for money After seeing all the raving reviews here we booked the Langham Place for our two stays in Hong Kong this month. Everything was true: This is an excellent hotel! Check-in was a breeze. We were very early so we could change in the spa after an 11 hour flight to HK. Hotel room was ready around noon: What a great room. Not very big but felt more roomy due to the glass wall of the bathroom. Everything you could wish for was there in the room. Great bathroom (with a view of the city and harbour), very comfy bed with lots of soft pillows, all kinds of amenities. I can't think of anything negative about the room or the hotel. We booked breakfast in advance (130 HKD per person), great. On our last day we had to leave very early for an 8.00 AM flight to the mainland so we had breakfast in our room at 4.30 AM. At exactly 4.30 breakfast was served to our room, everything that we asked for was there.The hotel is very conveniently located in lively Mong Kok, next to the Langham Place mall and the Mong Kok MTR station. The ladies market is around the corner. The hotel is not cheap but gives excellent value for money. I can recommend this hotel to everyone with all my heart.

<Content>memorable stay at Langham Place... We recently returned from staying at Langham Place in Hong Kong...I can only say it was an excellent experience. We splurged and requested transfers from the airport...do this...hot towells, water, porter all await you...worth the price, then we arrived, had our own check in person, took us right up to our lovely room on the 21st floor...nice view...finished...From then on it was great service, terrific breakfasts, lovely comfortable clean room and answers to all our questions. I simply cannot recommend this hotel enough...Some folks commented on location, actually we (my spouse and I) really enjoyed being in this area of Hong Kong...was a very busy, populated area...very close to the subway...no problem at all getting around...and we were actually always glad to head home instead of being downtown.We took the airport shuttle from the hotel back to airport and that was fine.Loved Langham Place...........kokosandiego

<Content>Great luxury in authentic setting! We booked this hotel for a 2 day stop over on our way back to the UK from New Zealand, the previous recommendations were very accurate and it certainly didn't disappoint.What we particularly liked was the fact that is was so close to a very authentic residential area so we got a true taste of Hong Kong culture, walk out of the door and you are in a busy street market. The room was amazing with wonderful views, the Spa and pool were great and well worth a visit, free unless you want to book a treatment which were rather expensive.We would suggest having breakfast in the Portal Lounge on the first floor rather than the rather busy main restaurant, this was a lighter option, much quieter and with good views.All in all a very memorable stay.

<Content>Fantastic We stayed here for 4 nights in Feb 08, and loved the hotel. On check in the room wasn't ready, so we were given complimentary drinks (without any prompting from us), and the room was ready within 30 mins. Hotel was immaculately clean and modern. Room was very comfortable, lots of mod cons, with perhaps the best bed i have ever slept in! The other half loved the pillow menu.The breakfast was excellent - a huge variety of everything you'd expect, and good quality produce. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful.We got the train from the airport to Kowloon, and then a cab to the hotel. Quick and easy.The location is fine, and the location of the tube makes travel very easy indeed. You can be at the harbour in a matter of minutes on the underground, which is clean and very safe.Mongkok is an interesting area, with lots of shops and markets.I would happily stay in this hotel if i visit again (unless i can afford the peninsula!)

<Content>Fantastic Loved our stay at the Langham. We took the train from the airport to Kowloon station and took a cab to the hotel (cost $25HKD). There were porters ready to help us with our bags. Checkin was quick and easy. We were given a free upgrade to the Executive Level.The room itself was small but very clean. Had every amenity. We had a decent view. Only complaint - the pillows were a little soft. Staff were very attentive. They were so polite and helpful! Location - very close to the station and close to the markets. Its so easy to get around Hong Kong with the MTR that its not that important to stay right in the centre of town. Mongkok is where all the action is and its more authentic than Causeway bay. We had a fantastic time and would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>The best I have stayed in in HK Mong Kok may seem an odd place to base yourself in HK but believe me, it works.Stylish, elegant, modern and sophisticated - from the scent of ginger flower in the lobby to the wonderfully appointed rooms, every detail is right at this luxury hotel. And the massive collection of art around the hotel is fantastic.The executive lounge is well worth the extra money. All day snacks and drinks, with stunning view. And the Spa is one of the best I have visited anywhere in the world.

<Content>A bit much They obviously invested a lot to make this a good hotel. But...1-Impossible to get to Portal bar from the guest floors unless you get off at the 6th floor or lobby level and take the stairs or another lift to the 5th floor. 2-Very nice afternoon tea selection, priced at HK$198 for two. Great loose leaf tea.3-The me branding was everywhere, on notepads note me, on minibar form eat me, hotel card take me...and an irritating message on the checkout envelope we miss you already.4-The open concept bathroom doesn't work for families. Even with the blinds drawn, the light pours into the room if somebody uses the bathroom in the middle of the night, disturbing those who were asleep.5-The Place restaurant staff aren't familiar with crumpets, clotted cream and jam, opting to serve their version, which is pancakes strawberries, icing sugar and maple syrup. And they'll explain to you that you're incorrect, even though their menu indicates the former.6-There was no closet space in the family suite, due to having four adult bathrobes, iron  ironing board, drawers and in-room safe.7-Internet cables are found in the minibar drawer, which is bizarre, unless you plan on connecting to the internet beside your closet rather than at your desk.8-Minibar red wine  JW Black were both very warm because they were in the drawer above the minibar fridge, which had no ventilation.9-Front Desk employees were very knowledgeable.10-Concierge  bellmen were on the ball.

<Content>Best hotel I have ever stayed in I have to say this is the only 5 star hotel I have stayed in so I don't exactly speak from a wealth of experience, but I found the hotel to be amazingly well-equipped and well presented without being ostentatious. The staff were very attentive but not overly-so.We stayed here for our honeymoon and because the staff knew this we were given a room with a better (i.e. harbour) view and a bottle of champagne on arrival, which was a nice touch. The rooms are just amazing, and they really do give you everything you can think of, right down to the shoe-shine kit and complementary umbrella! The bed was fantastic; enormous and wonderfully comfortable. I have never slept so well.I didn't use the spa, it sounded great but was very expensive. I also didn't use the gym, though it looked to be very well-equipped and you can go on the machines while watching the sun go down across the city! The rooftop pool was very nice, and there were never more than 3 people in there when we used it. The hot tub on the roof was far too hot in my opinion! The changing rooms were excellent, with a ready supply of towels and they provide lots of useful toiletries, even deodorant, hairspray and mouthwash! They also provide combs and brushes, with a steriliser machine to keep them clean, so you really don't need to bring anything down with you when you visit. There is a sauna and steam room in both the men's and women's changing areas.One of the best things about the hotel is the amazing location. Mong Kok is the 'real' Hong Kong, with street markest, little cafes and loads and loads of shops. We were so glad we stayed here rather than on HK Island which seemed to us to be very unreal and glossy. We didn't eat in the hotel at all, as it was expensive and far too western (i.e. the signature breakfast is a Full English!). We ate Dim Sum at The London Restaurant on Nathan Road (I will do a separate review of this - head out of the hotel at street level, left on Shanghai, right on Argyle and cross over Nathan Rd and turn right, it is a couple of hundred metres along here on the left hand side). This is the most fabulous dining experience and we had brunch here every day as it was so good. There are a million diner-style eateries in the vicinity of the hotel, as there is a big eating-out culture here. They are mainly un-licensed so no beer with your noodles, you pretty much have to head to hotel restaurants if you want alcohol. You can easily get main course, rice and soft drinks for two people for around 拢7 in these street-side cafes. The Langham Place mall also has a large number of restaurants which are a little more expensive, but also a bit more civilised!As the MTR station is downstairs in the mall basement, it is very convenient when the weather is very hot, or it is chucking it down with rain, as you don't have to go outdoors to get there (however it is probably quicker if you do go out of the hotel at ground level and use the Argyle Street entrance to Mong Kok station, as gettting into the station via the mall involves a lot of standing around on very slow escalators)I could go on all day! I am SO glad we picked this hotel for our honeymoon and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Fantastic Stayed at the Langham in early Sept for 3 nights. Since I was traveling with my wife and 4-year old, I booked a Residence Suite and had pre-ordered a transfer from the airport. This was a great choice. Arrived early in the morning from London and found the transfer desk easily. We were offered cold drinks and a welcome package which was a nice treat. Immediately took our luggage and escorted to our car. Upon arrival at the hotel, were meet by a receptionist who took us up to the Club floor to check-in. Again, offered drinks while we checked in. Was given an introduction to the Club L and the amenities offered in the hotel. Although early, we only had to wait 20 minutes for our room, 3707 to be ready. We helped ourselves to a few espressos in the Club to keep going. Staff in the Club were excellent. Very helpful and always asking about our stay. Most of the time, I was addressed by my name when entering the Club.Our 1 bedroom suite was huge based on HK standards. Nicely furnished with a full kitchen (3 different personal Haagen-Daaz treats in the freezer). We had excellent views although only a partial view of Hong Kong island (don鈥檛 expect great views of the harbor as too far inland). Also included an office and 陆 bath with a washer/dryer which was a nice touch. Bathroom was huge with a walk-in closet. Wifi was free for the Suites which was a huge plus considering my last hotel charged me USD35 per day. Breakfast was included in our rate and we had the choice of breakfast in the Club or the lobby restaurant. We choose the buffet breakfast in the lobby which was excellent and full of choices. The Langham is connected by an indoor bridge to a huge shopping mall with lots of food choices and a supermarket. We tried a few of the restaurants as our son was jetlagged and didn鈥檛 want to go far. Also provided access to the MTR which allowed us to easily travel around (I had lived in HK 10 years ago so knew my way around).The swimming pool is on the roof and was nice and warm. The gym is excellent with multiple machines and plenty of space.Check out was done in the Club L and again was fast. Car was waiting for us downstairs with our luggage.Don鈥檛 be put off by the Mongkok area. Lots of locals shop in this area and the MTR puts you close to everything. The Langham Mongkok is an excellent choice.

<Content>Fantastic Stayed here for the first week of honeymoon. The hotel was fantastic. Booked Club level room (directly with the hotel, so got a discount for 10% paying in advance). Stayed on 39th floor in a studio room: this is at the end of the corridor and has got 180 degree view (windows instead of walls for half of the room). View was amazing, especially as this is the tallest building in Mongkok. Staying at Club level meant we had access to the Club L lounge and you could eat and drink here, all day and also had access to computers, internet and printer.Staff were friendly, yet unobtrusive.Food was extremely good quality with plenty of choice, especially breakfast.Room was well decorated, with interesting artwork, extremely clean. Bed was comfortable.Free wifi (had iPod hooked up to it).Hotel building is delightful:with touches such as sculpture and paintings on every level.Location: in Mongkok, right in the markets, so not an ex-pat area (if that's what you are looking for)attached directly to the Langham Place Centre (shops, food, cinema and also MTR-underground-in basement-very convenient for getting around Hong Kong).

<Content>Simply excellent They don't come much better than this. Efficient and friendly staff, stylish interior and excellent facilities - what's not to like? We stayed two nights and loved every minute of it. For a first visit to Hong Kong, it was a great choice that made us enjoy the town all the more. I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again or in recommending it to friends.There were nice little touches from the minute we arrived at the hotel transfer desk at the airport to when we left again that put this hotel way ahead. How about an offer of something to drink and a refreshment pack when you've just come off a plane and can't wait to hit that shower? Or booking your restaurant, pre-empting all your questions about how best to get there and writing it all down for you in Chinese for the taxi before you can even begin to ask for it? Or checking your name from the room record rather than have you try to spell it out every time? In my book, it all comes down to thinking, caring staff that are doing their job properly. Full marks for that, and how I wish others would learn...Our room was on the smaller side but held our suitcases and two people without any problem, and still left us more than sufficient space to move around, work and relax. The one odd feature was the bathroom, fully exposed behind a large pane of glass. Fortunately, you could pull a shade on it. The hotel had warned that there might be trouble with the in-room WiFi system due to some works, but we experienced no problems with this. You may, instead, sometimes lose satellite TV input, but that was for brief moments and seemed to be due to weather (approaching typhoon).We only tried out the hotel's breakfast and the bar, both very good, but there are also several restaurants around if you don't feel like venturing out. There is abundant shopping and lots of restaurant options in the adjoining streets, however, and we found that the concierge makes good recommendations on these, too.

<Content>Luxurious Langham Place Hotel We took the family (2 adults 2 kids, 9  13) to Hong Kong Sept 24 for a week and had a wonderful time at The Langham Place Hotel. We had a quad room and it was perfect with queen bed and 2 single's, a magnificent bathroom and wonderful views. The Pool on the 41st floor was a real hit with the kids. The staff were plentiful and attentive. The buffet breakfasts were extensive and the Ming Court restaurant was very good. The hotel is attached to a very good fashion shopping Mall and close to Ladies Market, electronics and sporting goods streets. We found the MTR a dream to use, once we purchased the Octopus card. Entry to the MTR station was via the shopping mall - all undercover and air conditioned.

<Content>enjoyed this hotel very much i wanted someplace different to stay in Hong Kong this time and chose this one based on trip advisor reviews. the staff were super friendly and attentive. i mean they were great!! i chose the smaller room and yes, it was small, but it was nice. cleverly decorated, a little wear and tear but well within acceptable ranges. bed softer than usual chinese style, but still pretty stiff for my western tastes. the bathroom was unique and has taken up the newer style of having things open and visible if you want, but they allow for full privacy if you want that also. watch out for the faucet in the sink tho! jet powered and all over your shirt. they have a buffett place there that is really nice, again, waitstaff very friendly. it's in a good location for touring the markets and roaming around that part of HK. over all, an enjoyable stay.

<Content>Extremely overrated! Don't be fooled My Partner and I stayed here in late September 08. I truly can't understand the raving, salivating and gushing reviews on here.Friends of ours from Australia stayed here and also rave about it so we thought we would give it a go after we got caught up in a typhoon and could not get out of Hong Kong.We booked over wotif.com from the airport and arrived 1 hour later only to find they did't have our booking yet. The check-in girl in true Hong Kong style was rather aloof. I opened my laptop to show her the email that I recieved confirming the booking had been paid for however, this did not satisfy her. Rather than allowing me to come behind the counter and forward the email from my web mail with all the booking details and payment confirmation to the hotel, she made me wait some time for a user name and password from the internal office wif-fi system in the hotel so then I could forward the emial to their booking system. Then after she was satisfied that it was a legitimate booking, she then proceeded to fluff around for a long time before she took any details or allocated us a room. There was all manner of talking, phone calls, posing and posturing with others rather than paying attention to a customer - now correct me if I am wrong but aren't they in the hospitality business?Finally after a good 15-20 minutes we got our room. We arrived at our room and opened the door only to find we had been given a pokey substandard room that we didn't pay for with smelling carpet and a rundown cobbled together bathroom - just foul. We went back downstairs and asked for the room we actually paid for and after much fluffing around we were given a new room.  Only after some time we realised we had been given a limited mobility room........rather than moving again we decided to stay in it even though it was VERY questionable behaviour by the check-in staff to do this!We found the restaurant staff to be very rude, food way over priced and BE CAREFUL you do not order a freshly squeezed juice....this will cost 100HK or 17 AUD for a crummy glass of juice! My partner was sick and didn't order food and the waitress got irritated by it, she then proceeded to up-sell me on bread, dips, chips, drinks and anything else that could turn a $$ in lieu of my partner not ordering anything - do they have a minimum seat quota???The check-out process was another story indeed, the check-out lady seemed more interested in talking to others than helping us get checked out and to the airport to the point we had to step in and get her to focus on our check-out and stop talking to a colleague about something frivolous - something I have NEVER had to do in my life and I stay in plenty of hotels believe me!The Langham promotes itself as the most modern of hotels in Hong Kong but it doesn't even have free in-room wi-fi. All five star hotels that I have stayed in in Asia, have free in room wi-fi so I hardly think the Langham can promote itself as the latest and greatest all in all, VERY ordinary, VERY over priced and VERY misleading a 3.5 star at best!!! The bells and whistles don't account for or compensate for below average service and facilities - don't be fooled! Spend your money elsewhere for a better experience!

<Content>Perfect 5 star hotel .. This was the best hotel I could have chosed for our Hong KOng stay. The don't get a 5 star rating for nothing, the service and staff are fabulous, the room is comfortable and clean and eventhough there is no harbour view, the view of Hong Kong from our window is jawdropping. Our suite was the best. Club L was convenient and comfortable and there for our use whenever we wanted. Wines, spirits, beers, juices coffee, snacks both savoury and sweet were available anytime and always fresh and varied. Pure luxury.The breakfast was a huge selection of whatever you want including on the spot egg making chef, they attend to you as if you're the only one in the restaurant without being overbearing.The swimming pool is heaven and this hotel was our refuge in busy Mongkok. I would definitely recommend this hotel for 5 star comfort and convencience.

<Content>Reserve with confidence Previous writers have rated this hotel highly and I am simply adding my fulsome praise. We stayed for a week in September 2008. It is rare to enjoy such hospitality and attention to detail in a modern hotel. Location is convenient, interesting and well connected by taxi and public transport. Rooms finished and equipped to a high standard. Staff, whether concierge, restaurant, check in, spa, pool or Club lounge (well worth paying extra) were efficient, friendly and helpful. To be frequently greeted by name and a smile is commendable. Other H-K hotels, while often excellent feel 'stuffy' in comparison. Slightly larger room would have been nice but the hotel lacked for nothing. Probably the best city hotel experience I have ever enjoyed.

<Content>Second Visit...even more impressive than the first!!!! This was my second visit to the Langham and it was nothing short of fantastic .I arranged for the Limo, which for 3 people works out at around 200HK ($30A) more than the Airport ExpressIts door to door and Luxury all the way.The location of this hotel is perfect ,close to the markets ,adjoining a huge shopping centre and the MTR which takes you anywhere,but to be honest when there is 3 people its almost as cheap to use a taxi .The area around the hotel is very local and very safe you dont get all the touts trying to sell you suits and foot massages etc as you do in TST .Its a great area to just walk aroundWe had booked a suite on the club floor and it was fantastic We made full use of the Club Lounge which is open 24 /7 for drinks,snacks or just enjoying the view .Our suite was spacious and had everything you could want for a totally enjoyable stayLovely bathroom ,great TV and sound . The the bed was a little hard for my liking and when I mentioned this to the club receptionist it was fixed in an instant.This time we also tried a couple of the restaurants including the dim sum restaurant and had an exceptional meal at a great price.One final note I met a lady in the lift and I asked her if she liked the hotel as much as I did ,which she very honestly answered that she was the wife of the GM and appreciatted my commentsDo I have one complaint ---yes I only stayed 3 nights -3 weeks would have been better

<Content>Wow We have just returned from staying at this lovely hotel.Our first thought when we pulled up was eegh the location,more about that later.We were taken to check in and very quickly booked in.We had an executive room on the 32nd floor,it was great,large flat screen plasma tv,dvd player,coffee tea tray,floor to ceiling windows with a great view,the best bit was the bathroom with a glass screen looking into the bedroom,a lovely deep bath tub a glass shower cubicle and a glass wash basin.We also had bathrobes and slippers.The bed was very comfy and large(king size)The room was spotlessly clean and the maid done a brilliant job each day as did the turn down staff who replaced towels etc if needed.The pool is on the 41st floor and open from 6.30am until 11pm each day,they have changing rooms with showers and hot tub in,also everything else you could need gels, shampoo ,conditioner ,hairspray, deodorant,hairdryer.The breakfast buffet was excellent you can have eggs cooked any way hot buffet mix of chinese and english,bread and pastry counter,cereals porridge, cold meats and smoked salmon.They even have yakult and much more including a choc fountain.The dinner buffet is out of this world for 358hkd mon to thurs and 408hkd on fri sat and sun it is worth every penny ,the king prawns are the biggest ive ever seen and the desert counter is to die for.They have to much to list here.The location at first looks a bit scruffy but once you get walking about amongst the millions(it seems like it) of people it is great,we preferred this side to hong kong island.You are a 15 minute walk from temple street night market and 10 mins from ladies market and we felt very safe walking about at midnight.There is also a huge mall and mtr station adjoining the hotel.The only thing i would say is watch your bill,we went to ask about getting an early breakfast as we lraving at 6 and they tried to tell us we were only booked in to have 6 breakfasts out of 8 day stay,i had given them my voucher from travel agent stating 8 days but they were adamant and said they would have to ring them,it turns out we had paid for 8 so they said we could have the last days in room when i went to check out she was going to charge me ,said computer hadnt been updated (2 days ago)she said we wouldnt be charged,we will wait for the credit card statement to come.This was the only blip.They had alco left a large bottle of wine and chocolates in our room for our wedding anniversary which was lovely.So all in all i would say stay at this modern spotlessly clean and friendly hotel and soak up the local atmosphere.We thought it was great.

<Content>Great place, great hotel. We've just returned from a 6 night stay at this hotel and I can only echo all the praise extressed by fellow reviewers. Inparticular I would advise visitors to pay the extra for the club lounge - if you consider it includes breakfast which is something like 拢15 a head anyway then it's not a whole lot more. We were in and out of there all the time. It was very handy to use the lounge as a base, an extension to your room. We'd get back from visits and nip in for a drink and a nibble whatever time of day almost. It was never overly busy and we chatted to a number of people. The sinlge visitors we spoke to quite liked the fact that it was an opportunity to interact with others.The lounge is open 24 hours and acts as the reception for the club lounge rooms - I thought this was a benefit rather than an issue as has been stated by another reviewer. Be aware though that despite what the same reviewer said alcoholic drinks disappear at 01:00 until 06:00 - apart from bottled beer and soft drinks. Sometimes they did run out of sparkling wine and champagne too. Cocktails are DIY and there is no whisky - only about 6 bottles of branded spirits - gin, vodka, baileys, etcFood in the loung is nibbles - hot and cold - and there are set times for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and supper. They take the food away after these times and are pretty smart about doing so. We found it perfectly adequate so didn't require to eat out hardly at all and people often took soft drinks away with them for their day out. The gym is very well stocked and never gets busy. The changing area has a sauna and steam room and has all the disposable products you require and more besides - I hardly opened my own wash bag whilst I was there!It's a great hotel but what sets it apart is the lounge - it took a lot of the stress out of the break for us.

<Content>Great location Myself and my husband stayed here at the end of our honeymoon. We stayed in 3 hotels in Thailand before we arrived in Hong Kong. We had arranged the hotels car pick up service which was fast  efficient. On arrival at the hotel we were being led to the main check-in desk however as we were staying in a club room we shoudve been taken straight up to the lounge to check in. I had emailed the hotel letting them know we were on honeymoon and they said they would have champagne for us but we didnt get any. We were disappointed after the fantastic treatment we received in the hotels in Thailand.The room was on the 38th floor and we had an amazing view and could even see the harbour. We went to the club lounge every evening. We found the drinks selection limited with only one type of red or white wine and on 2 occassions there wasnt any wine left. Champagne was nice though! Sometimes it was hard to relax in the lounge as there was a lot of business deals going on around us. The internet access was handy too except when you had to wait ages to get on a computer.The suite was big and had a kitchen. we didnt use it but look out for the free haagen daz hiding in the freezer!! The bed was so comfy with lots of pillows.The location is excellent and with the fantastic subway system you can get around very easily and cheaply. The markets near the hotel are excellent. We had to buy an extra suitcase (in the market of course) to take all our purchases home. The hotel provide a free guided tour of the markets and shopping near the hotel - this is a great way of getting to know your way around the area. We had breakfast in the hotel and it was plentiful with a great choice. We had the buffet one evening but found it quite expensive. We also used the chuan spa and got massages which were ideal before our long flights home. If you are going to Hong Kong then definately stay here. You are only a few stops away from the harbour area and will get a better experience staying in Mong kok.

<Content>The good and the bad THE GOOD Great hotel - spend the extra for the Club floor to get access to the Club L lounge - free food and booze 24/7.THE BAD Surrounded by a slum!Mall over the walkway is good but a small range of decent shops and the Korea House was definitely not one I would recommend to eat at in the food court.All in all a very good find (went there because it was no. 1 on Tripadvisor) but would think about staying on Hong Kong Island in future nearer civilization and less shanty town.

<Content>Loved the Langham Our Langham Place stay started on a high note with our arrival at Hong Kong airport,we had arranged transfer with the hotel and our arrival at the airport hotel desk was greeted with smiles refreshments a lovely welcome and a speedy stress free transfer to the hustle and bustle of Mongkok and the towering glittering Langham Place hotel where once again the staff ensured that our welcome,check in and transfer to our suite on the 38th floor went smoothly and quickly.The rooms were spacious well appointed with a small kitchen lovely marble bathroom and a view over Mongkok towards the harbour to die for.The hotel is located within walking distance of the markets and a direct link to the underground station and you feel as if you are in 'old' Hong Kong.The Langham Place isa luxury modern hotel where the staff do everything to ensure that you enjoy your stay .We will be back .

<Content>Excellent value and great service at the Langham Place I have just returned from a 3 night stay in a club room at the Langham Place and would definately recommend this hotel to anyone, particularly the club rooms. Check in is done in the club lounge which was the only problem I had with this hotel. There was always a wait at the club desk whenever I went there including check in and check out as they seem to be doing the job of concierge and front desk for all the club rooms. At least you can enjoy a drink in comfort whilst you wait! The staff were always very friendly and efficient and apologetic if you had to wait.The room itself was on the small side but average for Hong Kong. However it had every amenity I could want with a modern bathroom with huge bath tub which you could watch TV in and separate rainshower. It had a huge LCD TV screen, DVD player and ipod dock. There was fresh fruit in the room and 2 bottles of free mineral water every day as well. The views were very good over to Hong kong island from the 35th floor.The club lounge was the best bit about this room. There was a selection of 7 different wines on offer 24 hours plus all the usual other drinks, all self service. There was also breakfast, afternoon tea, Mumm champagne, cocktails and a wide selection of canapes and a pudding buffet at various times. You could quite easily not need to eat much else during the day apart from the club food! There were 4 computer terminals, massage chairs and a selection of reading material too. I deceided to have breakfast in the main restaurant as it had a wider selection with everything from sushi and dim sum to omelettes and baked beans.I enjoyed the hotel pool which is outdoors on the roof. It is very modern and sleek by design with day beds and very comfortable loungers and free ipod rental as well. I used the spa and that was excellent - one of the best I have used. I recommend the heavenly scalp and foot treatment after a long flight. I also received a discount for this by booking in advance through the hotel website.Location wise Mongkok seemed perfectly safe to a single female wondering around. It is only a few blocks from Ladies market and the MTR is in the adjoining shopping mall. The mall itself had a large selection of restaurants, cafes, shops and a supermarket.I would definately stay at in this hotel again when I return to Hong Kong

<Content>Totally Excellent Experience! Having just got married in Fiji we arrived in Hong Kong for the start of our honeymoon. I had chosen the Langham Place Hotel from the reviews on Trip Advisor. I booked my accommodation direct with the hotel and was very impressed with the efficiency they showed with my booking\enquiries. I can honestly say this hotel throughly deserves it top rating on Trip Advisor!Both my new wife and I were extremely impressed with the service, the room and everything else about the hotel. Everything from the efficiency of the booking process to the warm welcome we received from the 'Pink Ladies' made our stay in Hong Kong extremely pleasant.Having worked in 5 star hotels myself, i can honestly say this hotel definately lives up to its 5 star status. We had a room on the 26th floor which has the most wonderful view looking back into the main city of Hong Kong. Located in Mong Kok the hotel is close to the ladies market as well as the best place to buy electronics. Pay no attention to any feedback about Mong Kok not being a nice looking place. Remember that you are not in 'Kansas' anymore as i felt like i was experiencing the 'true' Hong Kong. The hotel is excellently located to the MRT which we used everyday. The MRT is even better than the cheap taxis that are prevalent around Hong Kong as it is fast and cheap (although quite crowded at times but thats the wonder of Hong Kong!). Food outside of the hotel was cheap and abundant. Walking around we felt completely safe although you do tend to feel a bit worried when the stall owners chase you down the street when you dont buy thier goods (if they are really keen on selling you something they will keep offering you a lower price and hound you until you cave in but its all done in a very friendly manner).Price wise this hotel is very resonable. The money we saved on accommodation we spend at the stores! Due to our wonderful experience both my new wife and i will be returning to Hong Kong and we will definately be staying at the Langham Place Hotel again!

<Content>disapointing second visit This is my second stay at the Langham Place, my last visit was two years ago. The hotel has a good location in Mongkok, which is a slightly run down area but is safe for tourists, with easy access to a number of attractions and shopping areas, the primary reason for most peoples visit. The MTR is next to the hotel, although taxis are cheap and more convienient. The hotel has a good sized gym with a roof top pool, and the well equipped changing rooms feature a sauna, steam room and hot tub. Although showing signs of wear, the rooms are fairly spacious with nice bathrooms. Service at the restaurants and reception was efficient , but fairly clinical, I unsuccesfully attempted to arrange a late check out from my room , a simple and reasonable request, but I was advised to contact my travel agent in the UK as this would be easier ! If this is your first visit to HK you won't be disappointed with this hotels location and facilities, however for returning visitors or the more discerning traveller there are better alternatives available.

<Content>Great Hotel Great experience here. Excellent service from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left. The club rooms are worth the extra money because you get club privileges - late check in; free drinks and food 24/7; great views over Hong Kong from the club lounge and you can use the facilities after you have checked out if you have a late flight.

<Content>Magnificent Oasis of peace in the middle of the bustle of Mongkok. Superb hotel with all the expected facilities at a good value price. Our 25th floor Executive Room was spacious, clean  comfortable. Excellent service throughout. We have never had as stress free an arrival in a new city as we did in Hong Kong, having booked the transfer from the airport to the hotel. Good location close to subway, making easy connections to all parts of the city.

<Content>Best Hotel we have stayed in! We stayed at the Langham Place for 5 nights in August and were not disappointed. My wife and I both agreed that is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in.Hotel staff could not be more helpful and the standards of cleanliness in the rooms and elsewhere was excellent.Rooms are not huge but of a very high standard.Food quality is also superb and multi-cultural.The only slight negative point was the hotel's location, in that it is in a working class area of Kowloon that is not the most pleasant area to walk around (especially late at night). The MTR (Tube) is very close and efficient and Hong Kong island is about 15 minutes away.We booked one of the Club Rooms which are high up and give an excellent view of the City. Also the Club Rooms enable 24hr access the Hotel's Club lounge which entitles you to free breakfast (which is excellent) and free snacks and drinks at any time.

<Content>An Amzing Treat This was my second stay at this fantastic hotel.I treated myself to a suite and therefore had use of the amazing club lounge.I stayed during the olympics so the lounge was busy with people attending the games. The food and drink provided were excellent( all top brands and unlimited).Next time I stay, I will probably only book a club room as i didn't think the suite was all that.

<Content>Terrific location, peacefull rooftop pool area Wow, what a gem!I'll keep this review short as there are so many other positive ones. Loved the room, stayed on the Executive floor - it's worth the extra money for the views - in fact I didn't bother going to Victoria Peak because I felt I had a good enough view from the hotel. Plus I was tired and spend a goodly amount of time at their terrific rooftop pool - so relaxing and urban-chic!What I appreciated about Mong Kok was that it represented a grittier, yet safe, side of Hong Kong. I loved the markets and the hustle. On Sunday morning I went and snapped photos at the crowded fruit and veggie market - and feel that the neighborhood allows for a more true first impression of China. Later on the same day I went to the park on Kowloon (bit of a letdown) and the streets around it (a bit generic with the shiny Gucci and Prada stores etc). But then again that's not my scene and like I said I was dog tired, homesick, and not motivated to really see much in the 24 hours I was there.Back to the hotel - I would absolutely stay here again. Close to a great part of the city and right along the subway. Thanks for reading!

<Content>The good, the bad and the ugly After reading all the glowing reviews of the hotel on tripadvisor, my wife and I decided to spend three nights at the Langham Place, Mongkok in July. At check in, we were offered an upgrade for Hk$100/night which we took. Our stay can be resumed as follows: -The Good1. Check in was smooth and rapid. Check in staff and concierge really made that extra effort to assist us. 2. The bed was outstanding.3. Excellent location - Annexed to a shopping mall + right next to MTR station.The Bad1. The room was rather small2. The carpet looked old and worn3. One of the bathroom lights was not working when we arrived and had not been replaced/repaired when we left.4. All TV channels not working properly - had to get housekeeping to send their technician to reprogram the TV5. Mildew in the shower 6. Shower tap not screwed on properly - opening the tap would result in the tap coming off the wall!7. Shower diverter not working properly / incorrectly fitted8. Bath tub spout loose9. In room tea and sugar replaced erratically The uglyUpon my return home, I received an email, from the Langham Place, Mongkok requesting feedback, which I duly filled in and sent back, listing all the problems during my stay and letting them know that I could be contacted for further information. Guess what? Haven't heard from anyone from the Langham!ConclusionFrom what we have read on tripadvisor, we either weren't staying at the Langham Mongkok or must be the unluckiest people on earth to find such a room in the Langham Mongkok. I sometimes wonder where we would have ended up without the upgrade - windowless room in the basement??? It is a real pity that we had all these problems with the room as most of the staff were beyond reproach and it is clear that the hotel does have most of the ingredients to be outstanding. Just bad luck, I suppose!

<Content>Beautiful but major stressed me out twice! The hotel was clean, beautiful, convenient. Every detail from the scent to the paper to the bathroom mirror was executed with OC-ness. The hotel staff were very sincere, friendly, helpful  anticipated my needs. When the ref in the room was not cold, it was replaced within 5 minutes.EXCEPT, the reservations group badly needs improvement. And this caused me so much stress during my vacation.First, I emailed them to move my reservation forward by 1 day since my flight was cancelled due to Typhoon Nuri. They emailed back that this has been arranged. But when I checked in, they informed me that I was only booked for 1 night since I booked through a travel agency  they could only accept accomodation changes from the travel agency (hotels.com). It seems that I wasn't able to check another email they sent correcting their earlier email saying that it was all arranged. So I had to waste my precious vacation time emailing the travel agency  fretting over this. The next morning, the travel agency emailed me that they already extended my stay. I forwarded this email to the reservations group with a message that I hope everything is all cleared. It wasn't. After a whole day of shopping, tired and sore, the keys to the room weren't working! Had to go down to the front desk . They informed me that I was supposed to be checked out already! It seems that the reservations group was still waiting for further email confirmation from the travel agency. Couldn't they have just taken my forwarded email at face value? Or couldn't they just have called the agency? I spoke with the duty manager and said that I wasn't okay anymore. She sent me a new key right away and said they were sorry for the situation. I sent Langham an email regarding my experience but still no response 1 day later.

<Content>Excellent experience Stayed for 3 nights at the Langham Place in July 2008 as part of our honeymoon. Had a Junior Suite on floor 38, good value for money, well worth the extra spending.Executive rooms and suites have access to the Club L lounge, very nice, good atmosphere, food and beverages all day.Rooms are very clean and well equipped. Service is superb. Location is not ideal, but has a subway station nearby, 4 stations to main HK island.Swimming pool on floor 41 is amazing.Only two improvement areas: breakfast at the main restaurant is not a nice experience, food is OK but tables are far too near each other. Chinese restaurant not too good and very expensive for what they serve.

<Content>Nice Stay at the Langham Place We chose the Langham Place after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor...and we were not disappointed. We spent 2 nights at the Langham Place last weekend.We took the Airport Shuttle and reached the Hotel at around 12 Noon. I had booked an experience package and we were given a room immediately on arrival, even though check-in time was 3 PM.We were offered cold towels, and were presented with Welcome Drink vouchers and a complimentary Mongkok Guide book. (Much helpful), and were given a room on the 26th floor. Room was small but well equipped, view from the room was nothing to write home about. We did try the room service that night and the food was excellent, compliments to the chef... However we preferred to walk across the lobby and into the Langham Place Mall food court for the remaining days. I would recommend the food court. The food is cheaper and they have quite a large variety on offer.The Bar was quite a decent place to lounge around in, DJ early in the evening and then a live band later in the evening.Computers with high speed internet connections were available complimentary for guests near the Lounge. I used them to check in online for my return flight. I would however have loved it if they had provided free internet access in the rooms.We had booked the Hong Kong Island tour through the Hotel and the tour organized was excellent. Available: Large Plasma TV, DVD Player (However no DVDs), Cisco IP Phone, useful to check your account, however didn't find any use for it other than that. What sets the Hotel apart is the staff. They go out of the way to be of service. They even allowed me a late checkout , no questions asked. I would just stay here for the service. However I would expect more value for money.

<Content>Heavenly hotel An oasis of calm and luxury in the heart of bustling Mong Kok. We stayed on the Club L floor which aside from having a gorgeous room with a great view of the city it meant we had a special personal check-in in Club L where there is a free internet den, massage chairs and unlimited food, drink, breakfast, afternoon tea for Club L guests. The whole hotel smells of gingerflower which was lovely and is connected to a huge shopping centre with loads of nice shops, restaurants, coffee shops, supermarket, cinema ... basically they make it hard for you to want to leave the building.

<Content>Excellent place This hotel, as others have said is amazing. The staff are brilliant and can't do enough to help you, the facilities are great. It's right on top of the MTR station so if you need to travel then it's easy. The location is good for eating and shopping nearby if you don't want to go far. The pool and spa are amazing and the changing facilities provide everything you could ever dream of requiring to get yourself ready for a long flight.

<Content>Will be back! We chose this hotel based on the reviews on TP and also personal recommendation by friend of a friend. We stayed 5 nights in Aug. We had a 3-bed room (king size and a single bed) and although small for European and definitely American standards, it was adequate and normal for HK standards. We had a room on the 27th floor and the views are amazing. IT facilities in the room are really good and loved the IP phone, IPOD docking facilities. Cupboard storage space was small for 3 people; enough for the few days but not for 2 weeks. Positives on the hotel:1. Fantastic views.2. Excellent, friendly and helpful staff from the cleaner, doorman, concierge, check in staff. 3. Location for us was excellent. It is connected to a shopping centre and Mong Kok MTR is right under the shopping centre. This is my 7th visit to HK and I find the location works really well for us. It is not in traditional tourist land of Tsim Sha Tsui, Wan Chai, Central or Causeway bay. As a result, you get a better feel of real HK. There are not any of the guys trying to sell you tourist stuff. Prices are also cheaper here. A camera we bought was 800 HK dollar cheaper in Mong Kok than in Harbour City. 4. Swimming pool and sun bathing area is really good. On the 42nd floor, the views are amazing.5. Free computer use on the rest area is really good. However, trying to get on to them was sometimes difficult. There is a policy of 20 mins but some guests seem to ignore this.6. We booked directly on hotel website. When we arrived, we were not aware that the prices had lowered compared to the time we booked. The hotel gave us the lowered advertised price which I thought was very nice. Definite plus for customer loyalty! Only one negative:1. Breakfast might have been good. We took the no breakfast option which we would recommend. The day we decided to try out the breakfast, it was 10.20 and breakfast stopped at 10.30. They showed us our table, but by the time we got to pick our breakfast, the food was getting packed away. So we rushed around trying to pick up what was not being very quickly packed away. Why let us have a table if the food was going to be put away so quickly. Felt very cheated on paying nearly 200 HK dollar each for some cereal, tea and bread. There are plenty eateries for breakfast. We ate at Delifrance and McDonalds. There is a Starbucks in the shopping centre. All in all, excellent stay and will be back soon!

<Content>Mint !! Stayed here for 4 night and it was awesome. My wife is a frequent guest here for work and i didn't believe the glowing report but she was true. We had family room which had 2 singles and a double ned. The room has everything that you could think of in terms of complimentary water, toiletries, cordless room phone (that works anywhere in the hotel) etc. We used to olive in Hong Kong and choose the location as it allowed us to show the kids a different amd more real side to Hong Kong (as compared to Central). The Langham is situated in the heart of Mong Kok and is close to Sneaker Street and Electronic Street. The MTR station is a short 2 minte walk from the hotel and you can access Disney land via 2 stops on the MTR.The gym on the 41st floor has a great view and is very well equiped. Take a dip in the pool on the rooftop and enjoy and even better view !!The staff were very friendly and helpful. We dined twice at the Lobby Restaurant. The evening and breakfast buffets are unbelieveable and the variety is immense.Keep up the good work.

<Content>Position position with class This hotel is in a class of its own - a stand alone. The ambiance, the respectful and helpful staff , the quality of the hotel.I found the rooms to be great and not small, the bathroom clean, every staff member makes an effort to assist you with anything you request, and the position is fantastic. A few years ago, I would never have gone to Mongkok, it was drab and old. Now, this area and most of the shops surrounding the hotel have been renovated, new buildings and the only place I will stay is at the Langham Place. It is so close to everything , especially if you are on a shopping spree. I was not scared and the transport is so accesable to Kowloon...or you can take a 20 min walk to Kowloon.... It's usually the staff that makes or breaks a hotel, as well as the quality of the cleaniness especially the linen and clean pillows :). Its because of all the comments provided that I booked to stay at the Langham Place..Thank you tripadvisor! No trip has been booked without my tripadvisor!

<Content>Cannot go wrong with it, what everyone says is true: GREAT HOTEL I chose this hotel a/because of the excellent reviews, b/because of the convenient location in Kowloon. I wasn't disappointed. Although the rooms are the usual HK size, they are impeccably clean, have ALL you need and more, and the service is attentive and professional. I would go for a higher-floor executive room next time, although my standard one was cozy and modernly furnished. You have to pay for internet, which is probably something I would have expected included in the price, and with WI-FI and not just cable..The breakfast a-la-carte is good, and there are many closeby restaurants both in Mongkok and in the attached shopping mall that you can reach the Lobby floor.The laundry service is expensive and the ironing is not great, but if you need your clothes done fast, you cannot choose a better place. I found the overall quality to be very high and the price reasonable for Hong Kong. I strongly recommend it unless you can of course stay in one of the 5star hotels near the bay..

<Content>Above average We stayed here at the end of our 17 day trip to China and we were a little tired of traveling by the time we hit Hong Kong. I did not find this hotel as compelling as other reviewers. I am not that picky and there is nothing really to complain about with the exception of the pretty small rooms. This, even though we were on the executive level which had the larger rooms than the standard ones on the lower floors. The other hotels we stayed at (all 5 star places) were actually nicer than this one. The rooms were larger and the food on the club level, was better and more plentiful. Breakfast on the club level was fine but after this, there wasn't much to munch on. The spa was very, very nice. Based on the reviews on this site, I thought I just had to stay here. I was a little disappointed. I would advise checking out the other top class hotels in the city as well.

<Content>Loved the Langham The Langham Place in Hong Kong is an awesome hotel. All I really need to say to sum it up is that you can order different flavored pillows. There is even a pillow menu that describes each flavor and its benefits. This is the level of service at the Langham. If you decide to stay, you should stay on the floors where you get access to the club room. This room features free drinks and internet along with a place to lounge and relax in your very own massage chair. The hotel鈥檚 rooms are very spacious for the city and feature excellent views. They are very pleasantly decorated and the beds are good. The cleanliness of the bathroom is reassured as it features glass walls, which do take a little getting used to. The location is convenient to get to the MTR. In fact, you don鈥檛 even have to go outside to get to the station. The hotel is also attached to an insanely large mall and is near Ladies Market.

<Content>My #1 Hotel Stay ever Absolutely fantastic, best hotel experience i have had.Me and my girlfriend decided to have a 2 day stop over in hong kong on our way back to Australia from the UK. The room could not be faulted whatsoever, the standard was fantastic and beautiful.Views were phenomenal, with views of the light show at night and the hong kong cityscape.Service was fantastic, unfortunately my girlfriend had an accident were DARK PURPLE nail polish was spilt on the carpet, now at most other western hotels im sure we would of been looked down on us for the rest of the trip and ultimately charged for cleaning etc. Not here, they just sent up the correct people, cleaned it, the service standard did not change and we were not charged for the steam cleaning.Food was also absolutely fantastic, we ate in on the first night and got room service and the quality of the food was very good. One of the best meals i have had in a long time.The location is ideal, being a short walk to the MTR, Buses, Ladies Market, Computer Market and much more. I dont think you could get anywhere more ideally placed if you tried.The value for money was impeccable, being about the same price for an 'acceptable hotel' in Australia or the UK. I would gladly come back to this hotel if i was in Hong Kong.

<Content>What a "Place" Have just moved on from a 4 night stay at Langham Place, luckily moved just before the storm hit Hong Kong. Stayed in room on 31st floor, an executive room. Excellent view of Kowloon and could just about see the harbour from the big windows. Rooms are compact but big enough unless you are stuck in it all day. Amenities are good, bathroom nice, tv large with some english language channels, iphone thing useful if you have an ipod to plug in it. Breakfast was really good, lots of choices from dim sum to Japanese, smoked salmon, full cooked english (british) and healthy options also. The staff throughout are very friendly and helpful be that at breakfast or on the front desk. The bar areas are ok in a hotel sort of way, quite stylish but a bit soul less, a dj does play some tunes a couple of night a week but nothing too heavy. The pool area is tiny and ok for a swim if you wanted to cool down after a day in the humidity.The location of the hotel is close to an MTR so handy for connections and backs onto a shopping mall. Mongkok is a real Chinese enclave not touristy at all and all more an experience for that. We would stay here again if we came back.

<Content>Great overall hotel. I spent far too long reading a bazillion reviews on tripadvisor before booking this place. Here is the summary:1) Don't confuse this with the Langham. This is the Langham Place, Mongkok.2) I found this to be an excellent value. And, value isn't code for crappy. It was a very good rate compared to the others and it's an excellent hotel. The rooms are small, but very very nice. They do any excellent job of utlizing the room space with mirrors and glass so it doesn't feel small. 3) The location was excellent for us. Cabs in hong kong are very cheap compared to NY (our home town) and it's easy to get around. I would definitely stay here again. If money were not any issue I might consider something on the water since the lights are very cool, but that will get old quick. This is a very clean, very modern and nice hotel in a good location. Small rooms, but completely adequate.Stop reading the reviews. You'll just confuse yourself. Book this place now.

<Content>Great Stay Stayed at Langham Place on a business trip, On arrival received upgrade to a suite on the 39th floor, fantastic panoramic views across the bay. The suite was very luxurious, large comfortable bed, desk and sitting area, TV, sink and coffee making facilities. Wonderful large bathroom with separate bath and shower. But it was the views that made this room special.Check in was quick and efficient, with cold towels, bar area was very pleasant to sit in.Only stayed for one night before travelling to China, on my return had a standard room for two nights. Just a little smaller than the suite!! with only one window. This was a full size window though with a window seat. A glass walled bathroom was lovely and I spent Sunday afternoon in the bath looking out of the window.Room service was very good and the general service in the hotel was excellent.Did not use the spa but did go and have a look, this looked lovely, but I just didn't have enough time to try it out.Overall a luxurious hotel, and one I would recommend to others.

<Content>Cannot fault this place From the limousine pickup at the airport, through the personalised check in process, right through to checkout, the whole experience was seamless.Whilst it may not be the best hotel in the world, it certainly is very good at what it does. Some staff members spoke better, more intelligible ,English than others, but that was our only perceived problem.Upon arrival at the hotel, we were personally met in the lobby by our check-in consultant. Once the formalities were handled, we were sent off to our room with any required instructions, such as how to use the key cards, access, hours of operation of facilities etc. All comprehensively done.We only had a standard room but it was very good indeed. The large comfortable beds, quality linen, pillow menu, high-tech operation of all aspects of the room functions, personalised greeting on the Plasma TV and wide variety of screen entertainment options etc., were all of a high standard.The bathroom was perfect. All glass and marble and very nice products to avail oneself of. No screw cap toileties that you migh have to fumble with. Quality flip cap toiletries that were easy to use with either the rain shower or hand held option also.If only more hotels were like this. Especiall at the excellent rate per night we achievedThis is the only time I have ever awarded a hotel an 'excellent'; in review.Apparently Mong Kok has the highest density population of any area in the word, I have been told, though have not tested the veracity of this statement. It certainly impresses 'shades of old Hong Kong' on the mind in the way that the area is a little jaded, bustling, busy and crowded area. In this, the area detracts from the hotel. If a hotel of this style could be transferred closer to the harbour, it would be all for he better.

<Content>Fantastic hotel We stayed for 6 nights at the beginning of Jul 08 and had a fantastic stay. On arrival, they gave us the wrong rooms, but then upgraded us to a suite. The Club L rooms are great and the Club L bar is excellent. Included drink is all named brands, including free Mumm Champagne every evening. Also, food and canapes are more than enough to forget going out for a meal!Overall, very highly recommended.

<Content>Gd Location but... I just returned from a few night stay at Langham Place Hotel.True enough, the location of this hotel is extremely good. It's within walking distance to all the markets, e.g. Fa Yuen Market, Ladies and Gold Fish Market. There's also a 24 hr dim sum outlet  7 eleven shop just round the corner. Mongkok MTR is right below the Langham Shopping Mall. Considering that July/August is the rainy/stormy season, the linkage comes in very useful. The hotel room is not very big but I find the size pretty all right to me. The glass panel from the washroom is lovely. And the hotel provided all amenities. However my hotel room does not really have a view, When i looked out of the ceiling-to-floor windows, i was looking at the walls of langham shopping mall. Could be the direction of my room i supposed. We didn't managed to check in when we arrived at 2.30pm. The receptionist explained that the hotel was full, well i did saw a lot of tired souls sitting at the reception area with their luggages. As it was raining heavily outside and we were rather tired, we chose to rest at the lobby. We waited until 3.30pm before we were given the green light to check in.Overall, the biggest plus of this hotel would be the location. Other than that, given the amt of money that i'm paying, i will give other hotels along Nathan Rd for a try the next time i'm in HK.

<Content>Fantastic A great hotel with fantastic service. While the rooms have been slightly small the level of service by hotel staff certainly made up for it. In-room access was provided complementary for club rooms which was a nice bonus.In an interesting area too, adjoining a mall with an MTR station for convenient access to the rest of HK.

<Content>Great Experience After weeks of dealing directly with the hotel I ended up with a fabulous deal. Stayed in a spa room for one night as was booking a treatment anyhow and the price worked out the same. Started with a standard room but watched their site and eventually had a suite deal for 拢10 more per night than a standard room. Whole experience fabulous, from being collected at the airport with a member of staff waiting for us at the door. Spa room was small but fabulous, the whole experience made us forget about any jet lag. Access to the members lounge well worth it, had a few drinks there every night and some food after tours and shopping. Breakfast is better in the main area but much busier than the lounge. Loved the luxury but being left alone at the same time. Buy an Oyster card, well worth it. Not really worth getting the train up the Peak as you can't see anything. You can use your Oyster card on the star ferry and then get a bus to the Peak - better than making your way into town, walking and joining the long queue for this short journey. If you are vegetarian remember that most of the food contains oyster sauce ! for fast food, recommend curry in a hurry within the mall.

<Content>The best HK experience! I've been to HK many times but this trip by far was the best in terms of hotel experience. Langham Place is a great hotel with superb personal service and fantastic food. YOU MUST UPGRADE TO THE CLUB ROOMS! It's worth it and completely changes the experience. From check in to the personal room walk through, everything is 5 star personal service. And the 24 hour lounge, massage chairs, free-flowing drinks and snacks are perfect after a long day of shopping and walking around town.One drawback is the fact that it's located all the way in Mongkok. However, they compensate by having a pretty good mall beside it and the MTR station just a few steps away.

<Content>Diamond in the Rough Diamond in the Rough.My girlfriend and I stayed at LHP for 2 nights. It's in Mongkok, and all of the happening places are about 15-20 minutes away by train, and 100 HKD by taxi. It would really be helpful if you buy the 3-day MTR pass if staying at LHP. Now the good part...We stayed at the Club Rooms, and it was pretty standard because it wasn't that spacious. The exclusivity was key because not anyone may access rooms above the 36th floor. It was always well maintained and all the amenities were first class.It was definitely a room for honeymooners or a weekend getaway with a loved one. Then theres CLub L. Its a quaint lobby on the 36th floor that serves as a chill out lounge with all your hedonistic needs. They offer snacks and drinks 24-7, breakfast until 11am, cocktails and champagne from 6-8pm, and massage chairs that face a huge fish tank, etc, etc, etc. all these for FREE. I was blown away with the amenities because you can basically just pig out in the lounge area, eat some good cheese, drink champagne, and enjoy the view, and not worry about paying for anything. It feels like you're at home, and yet have first class service. On our last day, since our flight was at 9:55pm, they let us stay and lounge and settle down before the long trip home. I figured, after a long and tiring day of shopping around the city, if we had no place to rest, relax and recharge, our trip would have ended awful. Fortunately, Langham Place gave the best service and provided the best amenities. Full props to its professional and very accomodating staff! My girlfriend and I can't stop talking about it on our way back home. Nice.

<Content>Great Location  We stayed at Langham Place for a two-night holiday in their standard double room. The hotel is very luxorious and right in the center of all of the markets, so very central location. Everyone at the hotel was very helpful and always courteous. The room was very small, but this seems to be standard for Hong Kong. We were travelling with our 4-month old baby and the staff was great about setting up a nice crib and even giving us a basket of baby necessities (baby soap, lotion, etc). The workout room is amazing - one of the best we have used (and we've used a lot). Overall, a great hotel and a bit of luxury as long as you don't mind the small rooms.

<Content>Fantastic for families We are on a 6 month round world tour with two small children (4 and 2) We took a Langham suite with access to CLUB L and this is one of the best hotels we've stayed at. The service was impeccible, the concierge answered all our questions. Club was definitely worth having. Food at the PLACE was brilliant. Recommend the buffet. Chef provides great childrens meals (recommendthe baby shepherds pie ) Suite was quite small - this is typical for HK. When we talked to the concierge he recommended the Resident suite for families with an extra room if you have larger children because it has a kitchennette. Right on top of the MTR which means everything is a short ride away. Main shopping areas are right here. Swimming pool is fab with excellent view (42nd floor) and the spa and gym are 6* really amazing. Unless you really want HK Island this place is impossible to beat for value for money. Enjoy

<Content>The people make the difference If you expect people in HK to speak English fluently, I think you would be disappointed that most people do not speak the language, or at least pretend that they do not know. If not for the hotel staff in providing me with the utmost detail of what I needed to know, I would have had difficulty navigating through the streets of HK. I was especially thankful of Stephen Poon, the assistant manager on duty the evening of my arrival. Without his willingness to help my wife and I, our honeymoon through HK would not have been as good. The staff at the Langham will take the extra effort to make your time worthwhile. The facility itself is clean and neatly organized. The rooms might not be big, but they are made for the techie that I am. If you have not checked out the bathrooms, check out other people's photos. Yes they are transparent.The hotel sits in a pretty interesting area of the city. If you walk out to the Eastern exit, you will encounter the various shopping districts of Hong Kong from the ladies market to the electronics mecca of HK. To the Western side you can find the local street market where they sell anything from live chicken and seafood to the strangest looking so called food you can ever find anywhere. In all, a good place to stay. BTW, we ordered the pickup and dropoff service to the airport provided by the hotel (at a cost of course), and was happy with the service even if it was not cheap. It was convenient to have someone take you from door to door without much hassle.

<Content>great hotel one of the best Just back from the langhamplace hotel what a great place to stay we thouroughly enjoyed every moment of our stay here, the staff here cant help you enough and go out of there way to make you feel comfortable and have an enjoyable holiday cant speak highly enough about them. The hotel itself is amazing artwork everywhere on all walls and in every room there is something for everyone to feast there eyes on. The rooms are not big at least ours wasnt we stayed in the lowest room category but what you dont get in size is more than made up for in comfort and conveniance with big plasma tvs,DVD player and a phone system that is like your own information library you can get everything from exchange rates to weather forecasts to airport timetables it is something else believe me. The bathroom is spacious and has a bath and shower with great water pressure very clean and all the usual complimentary items thrown in and more,the bed and pillows were very very comfortable a great nights sleep.We were so glad we stayed in Mongkok as it is a great area and only a short train ride to anywhere. The hotel is linked to a shopping mall that is massive itself and the surrounding area is packed with all sorts of shopping. Please try some egg tarts cooked fresh everymorning by the locals they are to die for. We highly highly recommend this hotel it is the best i have stayed in Just one thing to note phone calls from the hotel to overseas are very expensive cost me around 25 aust dollars for 5 mins went out and bought a sim card the next day made at least 10 long calls to australia and still didnt run out of credit all for around $10 aussie dollars!!!!!

<Content>Better than any Ritz Carlton... Hands Down!!!! Great concierge service, great customer service, great dining, too!!! Gorgeous rooms, fantastic views, this was by far one of the best hotels we've ever visited! We had a minor mishap (one of our two rooms was unavailable till the evening because of a cruiseship layover). We were a bit upset after due to our extensive traveling, but after we discussed it with the front desk, they handled it very very well. We were compensated fairly and professionally. The following day they delivered wine and treats to both rooms AND included a handwritten letter from their manager! Very classy service!The breakfast buffet is not to be missed, and catered to every palate---- from American, English, Middle Eastern, Japanese, and Chinese cuisine selections. It almost reminded me of a more sophisticated Disney resort.Rooms were a bit small, but the exquisite decor and excellent design never let us feel cramped or congested. The location was perfect and so close to some fantastic restaurants. We will be sure to book here again the next time we stop over Hong Kong. It excels in everything you would look for in a hotel---- location, comfort, service... and surpasses many 5 star hotels in every aspect!

<Content>Fantastic hotel My husband took me to The Langham Place Hotel (not to be confused with the Langham Hotel) for our first wedding anniversary. We had a club suite and it was amazing - (the bathroom is bigger than the blue banana!!) it was absolutely divine. The roof terrace pool, the dream menu (selection of bedding), the spa, the restaurant, made the whole experience exquisite. The club louge provided a self service and well stocked bar with a variety of snack available throughout the day. Its lovely feeling to drink champgne overlooking Hong Kong!!The hotel is well positioned to the underground and the main shopping district.Cannot praise this hotel enough the cleanliness, the staff / service, food, ambience were all fantastic.

<Content>Good Value for Money The Langham Place is on Kowloon and in a great location. However, don't be fooled into thinking you will get any harbour view from here. You won't. We stayed in a Club room ( on the same floor as the Club Lounge ) It was a nice room, with a great bathroom. The room size is a little compact but it was all we needed for a two night stay. We used the lounge facilities every morning for breakfast, and again for cocktails in the evening. The IT facilities in the lounge are also first class and available 24hrs. We ate at the restaturant one lunch time which was actually quite good considering it was a buffet. The hotel is connected to a good mall so there is plenty of choice close by. We took a cab to the Star ferry to cross over to Hong Kong island. Cabs are relatively cheap here. The pool on the top floor has a great aspect over the city skyline and was quite a cool place to hang out for a couple of hours one evening. We took the bus service from the airport which was great as The Langham Place is the first stop in Kowloon. We ordered the limo service for the return journey which was seamless and a nice treat. Overall, the hotel is really good. Great value for money considering how expensive Hong Kong hotels are. The rooms are a little on the small side, and we didnt get to check into our room until 1pm (despite arriving at 0800) However, the Hotel did allow us use the lounge facilities until our room become available which was well appreciated. Will definetly stay here again. Highly recommended.

<Content>Loved the Langham We read many reviews, and tried to find a hotel in Hong Kong that offered luxury, but at a relatively affordable price. We wound up booking the Langham in Mong Kok. We booked a 2 room suite on the club floor through the hotel's web site (which I would highly recommend surfing, it's a little complex but the best deals for this hotel are there), at a little over $400 per night. While, as most people state, we found it a little out of the way, the hotel was wonderful. First, I would highly recommend the club floor rooms. the rooms are higher up, offering relief from the claustrophobia of Hong Kong. Second, the club lounge was excellent - and, like the rest of the hotel, it just grows and grows on you. It's open 24 hours, unheard of in this day and age, and offers breakfast, many courses of light appetizers, sweets at night, and drinks of all kinds, both soft and alcoholic, and champagne at certain hours. It also has 2 massage chairs, a business center with MAC's and PC's and printers, a DVD lending library, nice seating, and a nice staff, and expresso maker (which I loved, expresso every day, and excellent expresso at that). Next, the rooms. while they were a bit smallish for a suite, they had wonderful fit-and-finish, comfortable beds, 2 bathrooms and 2 flat panel TV's. Add a nice pillow menu (try it, they're not kidding, order your own pillow and it will be cheerfully delivered), internet phones with color displays, free internet access. All in, you're quite comfortable. Oh, I might add, and this was not clear at all (either from reading TripAdvisor or from the staff), if you're staying on the club floor, you can go down to the lobby restaurant for the sumptuous full breakfast (it's downright decadent), for FREE! It's probably the largest breakfast buffet I've ever seen (and I travel extensively). The only way we figured this out was to take a table and try it, as we got conflicting answers from the staff as to whether it was included in the club floor rate or not.The hotel also has an excellent Gym, nice locker rooms, slippers, fluffy robes, turndown service, an assortment of magazines in your room when you get there, daily newspapers, and more. The spa area was particularly nice and you don't need to go to a spa treatment to use it. The rooftop pool was also great, and if you want to venture further in the hotel, there is a complete business center on the 5th or 6th floor with about a dozen computers. Use of the computers is free. The one thing I would point out is that this hotel IS out of the way. On Sunday morning (no pedestrian traffic), it took us about 30 minutes at a steady, brisk walk to get to the Kowloon waterfront. I highly recommend taking cabs (and I usually walk everywhere), they are excellent, incredibly cheap, and very helpful. I think our average cab ride was about $4 anywhere in Kowloon. I can't wait to go again.

<Content>Great hotel. Awesome location. We just stayed at Langham Place in Hong Kong for 5 nites in May. It was a great location. Connected to a large shopping mall and a MTR station. To go to the MTR station, you can walk indoor all the way. The shopping mall has a supermarket. It was easy to get snacks and drinks. The food court in the shopping mall was great also. There are many great shopping places around the hotel. Within walking distance. In regards to the hotel, we love the room. It is a bit small for the price. For less $, you can get a suite (with a living room) at Eaton Hotel which is close by. But the rest of the room is great. Very clean. We do not understand how everything can sparkle after each cleaning. The shower was sooooo clean. The maid also goes out of her way to give us bottles of water when she sees us come back from a long day of shopping! However, it was a bit disappointing that the room smells musky if the A/C is off for a short time. Try to keep it on. We also had trouble with getting both English and Chinese newspaper. They do not understand that we would like both; tried to explain 3 days in a row (and I speak Cantonese). My husband does not read Chinese even though he looks Chinese. In summary, we loved it despite these little things. We will consider going back there but will probably pay more for a bigger room.

<Content>One of Our Favorite Hotels in Asia We just finished our stay at Langham Place Hotel. This one is an absolute gem. We loved our stay here. First of all, this is a classy hotel with amazing service and outstanding amenities. The rooms are excellent and include very confortable beds, a large-screen plasma TV, internet and spectacular views. There is excellent food in the restaurants. The breakfast is very luxurious. You can also order afternoon high tea, which is a great experience. There is a fantastic gym and spa. This hotel has an excellent location. It is situated right on the Mong Kok subway line. You just have to get downstairs and you're on the metro. There is a great shopping center (Langham Place) right across the street. The Mong Kok neighbourhood is vibrant and fun to explore. The Temple Street Night Market is just a short 15 minute walk away. Overall, this is without a doubt one of the best hotels in Hong Kong and probably in Asia. I highly recommend staying here.

<Content>Excellent hotel, wonderful service, great location We stayed four nights in a Club room in early May. Everything was great about this hotel, from the pickup within moments we arrived at the airport until they dropped us of again four days later (we prebooked the limo service, very efficient email response from the hotel). The location is also brilliant, with old style Hong Kong outside the door and new shiny Hong Kong 10 minutes away on the MTR. Buy an octopus card as soon as you get there, it is the easiest way to travel, it is a type of cash card that you load with money and then use for all your travel needs, MTR, buses etc. You can even use it for shopping, we ended up using it everywhere rather than cash. Public transport is very cheap and superefficient.The hotel itself is spotless, with the most wonderful fragrance everywhere and the staff is lovely. They were always very helpful and friendly with not the slightest hint of snootiness. We had an excecutive Club room which gives you access to the Club lounge on the 36th floor. This is a wonderful calm place to chill out with a drink in the evening, overlooking the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong. The main bar downstairs is very popular and quite noisy so it was nice to chill out with a quiet drink upstairs before going to bed in the evening. The Club lounge is open 24 hours and you have free access to hot and cold drinks, cocktails, some very nice wines, several different kinds of beer, various nibbles, little mini desserts (and very nice too!) etc. This is also where you check in and out if you have booked a Club room. When you are in a Club room breakfast is included, either in the Club lounge or you can take it downstairs in the main breakfast room. The lounge is more quiet of course but the choice is bigger downstairs, with everything from traditional congee and dim sum to the full English, if that is what you like. It was probably the best breakfast buffet we have ever come across. Everything was of excellent quality and the staff very attentive. If you dont fancy eating in the hotel, just walk out the door, the Langham mall is just next door with a large food court, or head out on the streets for some local flavours! There is literally gazillions of options just around the corner.The room itself (on the 35th floor) was of good size, plasma tv and all other mod cons, the airconditioning was easy to control and worked, the bed very comfortable with a mountain of pillows, plus a pillow menu if you fancied even more or different style, including scented pilows. The view over Hong Kong was wonderful, could not have been better, we were overlooking Hong Kong island and Victoria peak. The bathroom was also lovely with a great rainshower and separate bathtub. The evening turndown service also serviced the room, tidying up, checking the towels etc so the room was actually tidied up twice a day! Also left some gorgeous chocolate to look forward to every night....The swimmingpool is on the 42nd floor so needless to say the view is wonderful. It is quite a small roof top area so the sunloungers were often all taken in the afternoon, but it didnt really bother us as we just wanted to cool down with a quick swim before heading out again. Some previous reviewers seems to have issues with the location, however, we felt that it was by far the best location in all of Hong Kong for us. Mongkok is still retaining some old style, where locals still live, and shop. There is a faboulus local food market at the back of the hotel, OK, it is not for the faint hearted as all sorts of living creatures are for sale for the dinnertable, but for us that is what travelling is all about. It is a perfectly safe area, just use your common sense as in all large cities. We wandered around the streets at night, ate at street food stalls and generally had a great time and then went back to our wonderful quiet room for a good nights sleep. When we return to Hong Kong we will definitely be staying here again, as it is one of the best hotels we have ever had the pleasure to stay in.

<Content>Weak start, strong finish If not for a poor start, I would consider rating this hotel as excellent. To begin, the hotel has a visitor's desk at the airport where you can get transportation to the hotel at a reasonable rate (good). Regrettably, the clerk put me on a bus to the wrong hotel (bad). Not a big deal. Mistakes happen. They quickly rectified it by having a limo pick me up quickly and transport me to the correct property. I arrived there at 3:30 P.M. and was notified that they had granted some guests a late checkout and that my room wouldn't be ready until 9:00. 5-1/2 HOURS LATER! Why they granted guests such a late checkout is beyond me! I was perturbed, to say the least. The clerk tried to assuage me with a coupon for a free drink at the bar, but this only angered me more. I went for a walk to kill time and returned at 8:30 to find that my room was ready. After midnight, the phone woke me up 3 times. Apparently, someone in another room was calling the wrong number. I was a bit annoyed that the operator wouldn't tell me who it was or that she didn't offer to call that person and ask them to stop the calls. Eventually, I set the phone on DND and that put an end to it. To be honest, I needed a full day to get past a horrid start. But I'll give credit where credit is due. The hotel rebounded strongly! First, the room was very clean and comfortable and it is connected via a walkway to Langham Place shopping center. It is also right next to Mongkok transit station. They have the best fitness center of any hotel I've ever been at in addtion to numerous holistic therapy offerings. It's quite impressive! The staff is extremely courteous and friendly. The hotel has an internet access area with about 8 PC's or laptops that are free for the guests to use. There was always one available when I went there. I ate at one of their restaurants (the name escapes me) and had a very good meal. During one of my stops at their internet access center, I accessed their website and sent some feedback about my disatisfaction with the start to my stay there. I was pleasantly surprised to return to my room that evening and find a message from a manager apologizing for the problems and asking to discuss them with me. I never got a chance to talk to him because of my schedule. However, we corresponded via email and he removed the bus fare charge to the hotel and the limo charge back to the airport from my bill - a generous and appreciated gesture. Finally, I should mention that the concierge desk was extremely helpful and made things very conveneint. I should cite Eddie Ho in particular. He couldn't have been nicer and went beyond my expectations as to assisting me. In summary, I give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and chalk the poor start up to a bad decision on their part, but then they made up for it after that. I would probably stay there again.

<Content>Lovely hotel in bustling Mongkok Enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much. We booked it because of the recommendations on tripadvisor and we were definitely not disappointed. We booked directly with the hotel and included breakfast with this package. I would recommend that you take the breakfast as it is an excellent buffet with a huge choice of food. We also booked the limo from the airport which made our journey from the airport less stressful. The staff at all times were very pleasant and helpful. Although the bedrooms are not the largest that I have stayed in they are very well appointed and have all the amenities that are necessary with lots of lovely toiletries in the bathroom. The room was immaculately maintained and we were never disturbed in the room yet it had always been serviced when we returned to the hotel in the afternoon/evening. The hotel also has a lovely pool on the roof. Apart from the hotel and adjacent mall the surrounding area is not particularly upmarket and if I had known this when I had been booking the hotel I would probably not have gone there but in fact it was not a problem and we never felt threatened at any time. I was happy to walk in the vicinity of the hotel on my own without my husband. Although the hotel is slightly further out from the centre this is not a problem as it is adjacent to the MTR which takes you all over Hong Kong quickly and at a very reasonable price. Again it is clean and very safe. If I were returning to Hong Kong I would certainly stay again at this hotel as you get luxury at a very reasonable price.

<Content>FANTASTIC! A+ HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE! BEST SERVICE! 5 stars overall!!!! The Langham Place in Mongkok has A+++ service! It is a beautiful hotel with various facitilies to suit families and business travellers.The service at this hotel is 5 stars. The staff are always friendly, willing to help, and will give you information where ever you need. Every single person who we encountered were fantastic and provided only the best customer service. As for the rooms they were presented beautifully and the option to choose a scented pillow for your individual needs is great. The room also has internet access in which you can connect to broadband services and there is also basic internet browsing on the tv. The other technology is the CISCO phones which allow you to get information about Hong Kong, foreign currency rates and you able to view maps on the screen. The ipod/mp3 dock was also very useful in this day in age when everyone has one. The higher levels in which were staying were great you could see a great view! Overall very impressed with the rooms! This trip was certainly made better by the club L room - this level gives you free access to the internet, various books to read, a FANTASTIC view, and food and drinks always on hand. The best thing about this is that it is open 24hrs and there is always people on hand to help you - either for directions or different enquires. However the other facilities are great with an extensive gym, sauna,pool, spa, sitting rooms and dining areas.The location is great! It is in central Mongkok and there are various shops just across the street. I appreciated the accessibility to everything - for those tourists there were the ladies markets and various other attractions. The MTR is right nearby and therefore makes it easy to get to around Hong Kong. So overall with the helpful people, the lovely rooms, the location of the place and the great facilities it combines to make it a pleasurable hotel to stay. Would defintely stay there again! 5 stars!

<Content>Great stay but one issue Booked directly with the Hotel and stayed over New Year. Emailed them requesting a car service from the Airport and received a prompt reply. Service was very efficient at the hotel desk in the airport to the car.The Hotel is right next to the Mongkok MTR subway and transport links are truly excellent both to the airport and Hong Kong island. Mongkok is busy, with a very high people density.I'd booked a suite on their club floor and hence checked-in at the Club Lounge on 36th which was pleasant change from the normal hotel hassle. The club itself has great views and the service from the butlers is excellent.The room itself is a little bit on the small size, but not a big issue. Everything was of very high quality, including the plasma tv! The restaurant on the ground floor for breakfast was excellent as was the gym/swimming pool facilities.The only issue we encountered was that my wife suffered from food poisoning - presumably at the hands of hotel food given we'd only eaten in the hotel for the previous 24hrs.The hotel staff responded extremely well, getting an english speaking doctor (actually he had trained as a doctor in Birmingham, UK!) and paying for him. However, a day and half was knocked out of our holiday because of this.I've previously stayed at the JW Marriot at Admiralty, Hong Kong island which was more convenient as a base for access to both Kowloon and Central. However, Langham Place is a very good hotel (and more reasonably priced that the top hotels on the island) so as long as your happy to be put out by 10min or so travel, I'd highly recommend staying here.

<Content>A delicate flower growing in the cow pat that is Mong Kok As per the previous reviews, this hotel is really something special, I stayed on the club floor, enjoyed the club lounge, had a stunning room, with a stunning panoramic view of the city, the service was flawless, and very good value for money. The location however was a little out of the way and in a fairly feral neighbourhood. The smell of raw sewage at street level was enough to turn my stomach.

<Content>Fantastic stay - agian My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights. It was our second visit to the hotel - and it was fantastic (as last time). The hotel itself us super. But also the area is an experience. When you leave the hotel you are in the very middle of the shopping streets of Mongkok. Especially in the evenings it's fun to be at the streets.This time we decided to upgrade to the Lounge area. The food and drinks were nice but the service was lagging. You should take the upgrade if you really spend time at the hotel.

<Content>Noisy Bar, Rooms Small but otherwise OK Lovely feel to the place with great staff...the breakfast is worth the 拢12 and the SPA is amazing. The down sides were a very noisy bar where the noise radiated in to the lobby..You sadly couldn't sit there and chill out with a cocktail at the end of the day unless you were shouting over the DJs music. The other down side is the rooms were seriously small...when our room service came on a table you couldn't use it as it was too big! I also believed it was free WIFI but it's 拢10 a day. The pool was also very small so it's not the place if you're a sun worshipper. Would recommend if you're there for a few days and want to be near the markets and MTR.

<Content>An Amazing Hotel We had an amazing 3 night stay in this hotel, without doubt one of the best hotels we鈥檝e ever had the pleasure of staying in. The first thing that struck us on arrival, aside from the extremely friendly and efficient staff, was the smell. We later learned that ginger is the Langham鈥檚 signature scent which permeates throughout the hotel, extremely subtle yet noticeable but just beautiful. We were offered an upgrade for HKD 500 per room per night, even if the rate is a little more expensive as we travelled off peak, I would recommend availing of it as it was money well spent. The upgrade gave us access to the club lounge, which had food and drink served all day and also included breakfast each morning, an exquisite buffet selection with some chefs on hand to rustle up an omelette of your choice! The rooms are extremely comfortable and modern, a reasonable size with some great views of the city. The hotel itself is located beside the metro station which makes it a good base for travelling around the city. When we booked our trip to Hong Kong I was disappointed that we weren鈥檛 staying at the renowned Mandarin Oriental, but once we entered the lobby of the Langham we felt it couldn鈥檛 be much better than this.

<Content>My Favorite There're many classy hotels in Central if you pay a certain amount of money, but sometimes you feel it's overpriced because you can't be satisfied with the room, the staff, the location etc. Don't worry, it doesn't happen in Langham Place. The staff are extremely friendly and supportive, the rooms are spacious and modern, there's a metro station right next to the hotel, and the price is fair enough. I really can't think of anything to complain about. . But I had an intereting experience once - I was staying with my sister and we wanted to give this good-looking porter some tip, about 15 euros I remember, then he said 'No, no! Please! I can't!' and went away. . . Anyways, I think this is the best hotel in Asia with no doubt, and I'll definitely come back here again.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Of the numerous five star hotels I've visited in Asia, this is one of my favorites. The service was exceptional and there was really a buzz about the place. As a younger business traveler, I especially enjoyed the energy and a modern elements of this hotel. The management made a tremendous effort to insure that my colleauges and I were very comfortable.

<Author>Traveller885
<Content>Superb Hotel As most reviewers here have noted, this is an absolute gem of a hotel with amenities and facilities that are generally in the almost 5 star hotel class at much less than 5 star prices. The only significant drawback is the smallish room sizes, which also means that there isn't much furniture to sit on in a Club L Room other than the bed. (There is one desk chair and one none-too-comfortable sitting chair, so for two people, watching TV has to be done from bed.) However, the bed is ultra-comfortable and the choice of pillows (which you can select in advance of arrival from a pillow menu) is excellent, easily matching the beds, pillows and linens of the Peninsula or any Four Seasons.Other than the small room sizes, it's a top-notch place, with a friendly and generally helpful staff, a superb club lounge (with free internet access and beverage service 24/7, and a fine array of snacks put out at various times of day), a heated outdoor pool that is one of the better ones in town, and the advantage, on rainy days, of being connected to a sizable shopping mall. The Club L lounge furnishings are lavish and spacious, and on non-cloudy days, the view from the lounge is special.Breakfast in the lobby level restaurant is comprehensive, with various pastries and breads, an array of cold cuts, both Japanese foods and a small selection of dim sum, a variety of cereals, made to order omelets, bacon, sausages, pancakes, yogurts, and a wonderful choice of fresh fruits and fresh fruit juices, including not just your standards (e.g., organge juice, grapefruit juice, apple juice, etc.), but watermelon juice and others. Most people who indulge a bit at breakfast won't find themselves wanting to have lunch at all.The rooms are cleaned several times a day by a fastidious, truly remarkable staff. If you use their shower cap, they will replace it with a new one. They make sure that the bathroom is spotless, as well.I recommend this place enthusiastically.

<Content>I stay here EVERYTIME I'm in HK. I totally love this hotel! The rooms are sizeable and clean, the bathrooms are fantastic, the bed is SO comfortable. The location is in the now revamped 'cool' area of town Mongkok where there's tonnes of food to eat, and a trendy young shopping mall with cinema connected straight to the hotel. Service is also excellent.Only downsides - Mongkok is far away from HK island. MTR is pretty slow and it seems to take ages to get there, but for the price, it's pretty worth it since all places in HK island probably cost twice as much.Also if you're a Star Alliance member you get points!Overall HIGHLY recommended. Stay here if you don't mind commuting to HK island!

<Content>Langham Place 鈥?Many Great Amenities  My wife, my 16-year-old daughter and I just completed a six-day/six night vacation at the Langham Place during April 2008. It was very, very enjoyable for many reasons and I鈥檒l break down the hotel and our experience based on Location, Rooms, Amenities, Staff and Restaurants for everybody to review and make their own choices. Each category will be rated on scale of 1-5, with 1 being horrible and 5 Outstanding We all would definitely stay there again, and for those who are making their first trip to Hong Kong we both loved the city and entire six days.Location 鈥?Overall Rating 4The location from out point of view could be broken down based on access to transportation, neighborhood, and Kowloon or Hong Kong side of city. Transportation and LinkagesThe spot is good; not great. Hong Kong is a walking city and has a terrific public transportation system. The Mong Kong location with the MTR adjacent to the hotel was great. However, there are better locations with comparable locations either on Hong Kong Island at Central or Admiralty stop or on Kowloon side at YTR stop. Very nice and easy to get anywhere and would not hesitate to stay again. 4.5 subsection ratingNeighborhoodThe Mong Kong neighborhood has some very nice features and OK features. First, the hotel is adjacent to Langham Place, a vertical in fill mall. It鈥檚 not a super deluxe mall, but more mid 鈥?level with many nice stores, but not many luxury brands. I would suggest that the neighborhood reminds me of Times Square in New York. Every conceivable retailer imaginable available and people all over the place. For those who love to shop at the Hong Kong markets a few blocks from the hotel is the Ladies Market. Yes, my wife and daughter made it there twice and loved it. Finally, there鈥檚 not many restaurant or other options outside the hotel so for those who don鈥檛 want to leave the neighborhood this might not be the place for them. 3.5 subsection rating.Kowoon or Hong Kong IslandThis is a toss up for anybody. However, after my week in HK, I would suggest that Honk Kong Island would be preferable to Kowloon Island. There鈥檚 definitely more of everything. We found ourselves going to Hong Kong Island almost daily. Most of the ferries to the outer islands leave from Hong Kong Island. Frankly, but for the laser light show, which must be seen from Kowloon Island and the view of Hong Kong Island is your staying at the Intercontinental or other comparable hotel with drop dead fabulous view of Hong Kong island I can鈥檛 see why would want to stay here. 4 subsection rating.Rooms Rating 5It鈥檚 hard to say much bad about the rooms. We had a 600 sf suite for around $375/night. I felt that was a very nice deal. We were located on the club level, what they call Level L. it was very nice and the room was very nice. Nice linens, two flat screen TV鈥檚, nice washroom, great view, etc. Could not of been better. Staff Rating 5This is easy. They could not of tried harder to please; top to bottom. From the moment we checked into the hotel after flying 15 hours non-stop from Chicago to when we checked out, each and every staff member was extremely accomadating. This did not just stop in the concierge lounge, but included everybody at the hotel from maintenance, housekeeping, attendants in the gym, etc. Amenities Rating 5Both in the hotel and surrounding the hotel they were terrific. To start with the hotel is connected to the Langham Place mall. Not super luxury, but very nice with lots of fast food restaurants and a Starbucks right out the door from the hotel lobby on the 4th floor. Additionally, the MTR was right next to the Langham Place. You could access either from the interior of the mall or a short walk outside. Terrific.However, hotel amenities nothing to sneeze at. Hotel spa was wonderful. We had two separate treatments and the therapists were wonderful. Wished they were closer to me 100% of the time. The exercise room/gym was fully equipped. Though we did not use the pool, we viewed it and it鈥檚 a wow experience. Hard to beat. Restaurants Rating 5We solely went to The Place, which was their continental restaurant and Ming Court, which was where we enjoyed Dim Sung. Both were wonderful. We had breakfast every day at The Place. Was great. The hotel buffet breakfast was terrific and included a number of items that were traditional, English, Asian and a combination. Terrific. Ming Court was great. Frankly, it seemed to be frequented more by locals than guests at the hotel I consider this a good thing.SummaryOk. So I loved the hotel and loved Hong Kong. Yes, I did. With the exception of the slightly offbeat location, this was a five in every other category. That being said, it鈥檚 totally impossible going wrong at the Langham Place and I would highly recommend for either a vacation of business trip to Hong Kong

<Content>Langham Suite 3620. Having been to Hong Kong for the past 30 years and stayed at numerous 3, 4 and 5 star hotels, we chose this hotel based mainly on Tripadvisor's top ratings - and we were happy that we did so for a 2 night stay, from 9 to 11 April. Booked their Langham suite and requested for a higher floor room with good views of the Victoria Harbour. Upon check in at 7pm, we were given room 3620, on the same level as its Club Lounge - very convenient to drop by the Lounge for both checking in and out. View wise, yes, it was quite good too but the Victoria Harbour was a far distance away (nothing as compared to the Hotel Intercontinental and Hotel Peninsula). Though we knew from its website that the suite was 600 square feet in total area, our first impression was - is this really 600 square feet? Though in reality, the suite had appeared smaller than its website pictures, the suite was, nevertheless, cosy and very comfy, good enough for a few nights stay. There are two toilets in the suite - one main one with both shower and large tub while the other merely has a toilet and a single sink. There is also a kitchennette with a coffee maker, a water kettle, mini bar with free ice creams!, bread toaster etcChocolate coated biscuits were also placed in our suite upon arrival, a well appreciated gesture after a long day in Guangzhou! Two bottles of distilled water were also replenished daily in the main toilet. Besides an easy to use safe, there is also an iron and ironing board, two flat screen TVs (of the Haier brand that has somewhat poorer resolution), 2 seater sofa (very hard and uncomfortable though!), single seater and a small dinning table with two chairs for small meals. Our separated bedroom (with a lock for extra security) comes with two twin beds, as requested. The beds were, in our opinions, comfy enough but not of the Westin quality. And each person were given 3 different types of pillows (even with a small bolster, very rare in hotels!). However, all the pillows were too soft for us to provide enough neck support ....resulting in us having neck strain the next morning. Breakfast was either at the Club Lounge (nice Western varieties but somewhat limited in range) or at the Restaurant on Lobby level. We opted for the latter cos it provided a much wider range, which includes dim sum (though its quality were not up to par with those served in HK restaurants and cafes). On the second day, we ''sacrificed'' breakfasts at the Hotel totally and had good dim sum at a nearby Restuarant on Nathan Road (the name is Dou Heung, quite good quality I must say). The roof top swimming pool is a sight to behold, really. Went for an early morning swim and had a memorable time there. The only complaint was, being an open air pool on such a high rise building, it can be quite cold and windy in the mornings.  Our only three glitches here were - 1. on the first day of our stay, our room was not made up even though we were out at 8am and back by 1.30pm 2. even after asking for harder pillows on the phone, they never seem to show up ...? 3. the shopping and local area of Mongkok only offers low to mid range shopping, as higher end brands are almost located on the Hong Kong island side. Though Central was only 5 MTR stops away (a 10 minutes ride), do beware of pickpockets while in the train and while moving up and down the narrow escalator ... My husband's hind trousers pocket were cut open, but luckily, nothing was taken. Lastly, having asked to see the next higher suite category, the Harbour suites (was told that there were only 3 such suites in the hotel), I felt we were glad we didn't opt for that suite category - being at only HK$1,000 more per night (Good value for the extra space), it offers 800 square feet of space with an extra big bathroom, changing room and a small study room. However, the views were nothing as compared to our Langham suite! All in all, we had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Would return to the Langham suite or Residence suite (the same 600 square feet at the same price but with a bigger kitchennette) again.

<Content>Not a five star hotel, more like four star/three star Upon arrival, we had a long 14 hour flight and the front desk said that we might need to put our luggage in the room and come back at a later time since we arrived so early. However, after searching on the computer, she then says that 'oh I see a room available.' I thought what they should have done was checked first to see if a room was cleaned first and if not then let us know. We were put in room on the 19th floor. I had reserved the room in advance from their website for about $200/night. I was not happy with the room and requested a change of room the next day. The room we were given had a ripped blind in the bathroom, the marble floors were yellowish in the bathroom entrance and some of the bathroom area with brownish/black grouts. And lastly, the air conditioner set on auto did not turn off all night.I called front desk and spoke to Amy telling her that I was not happy with the room and explained it to her. She apologizes and said she'll take care of it and call me back. I waited over 30 minutes and did not get a call back. I called back and Amy says 'oh, I thought someone was suppose to call you'. After putting me on hold for a few minutes, Tina comes on the line and asks me what was the problem I had with the room. I was impatient by then as I had already explained it to Amy. Tina said a room was not available as it was early in the morning. So I requested that they move our luggage while we were out and they can put move our luggage when a room becomes available.We came back and we were put in room 1818. The bathroom still had yellowish stains on the marbled floors with brownish grouts, but less than the 1st room.Other than this, our room was very clean and the cleaning staff did an excellent job in providing all the necessities in the room. Though the coffee maker was really old and stained. We were afraid to use it. We were greeted coming in and out of the hotel. The hotel pool and spa is beautiful and immaculately clean. Service was excellent otherwise. The location is great for us as it across from the MTR station. If you don't want to pay for the hotel buffets as it is pricey, there are restaurants right across the street and pretty much all around. We also ate a few times in the mall area. Very convenient.

<Content>loved this hotel! Very impressive stay from start to finish--excellent website made it easy to book, immediate feedback from concierge re airport pick-up.Stayed in Club room--not very big but had everything you might need. Check-in was conducted in the Club Lounge by a very efficient young woman. Snacks and drinks were nicely presented. Internet access there was comfortable and free.Buffet breakfast and dinner were also excellent. Took advantage of the hotel's free evening tour of the Mongkok district--very interesting and fun. In fact, this neighborhood with its crazy crowded markets was totally fascinating. Also worth a visit is the Shopping Mall adjacent to the hotel. Futuristic, high-tech and teeming with young people enjoying recreational shopping and eating.No negatives really that I can think of unless you must have a harbor view--with all the fog we had, that would have been money wasted had we stayed at the Intercontinental as we did on our last trip.

<Content>excellent hotel, but small rooms - even smaller bathrooms This was one of two hotels we stayed at in HK, the other being the Novatel Citygates on Lantau Island, near the airport. In many ways, this is an excellent hotel, but it has one major drawback: the rooms are small, and the bathroom is even smaller. For this reason alone, the Novatel was better.Transport to the hotel from the airport is a breeze: go straight to the shuttle bus booths to the right after you come out of arrivals. Langham has a booth (There are two Langham hotels in HK.) The excellent shuttle bus to the airport is 130 HK$ and the service is excellent. (By Mercedes limo, it鈥檚 550 HK$). The sky-blue coated staff give you a sticker. When the bus is ready, they whisk you and your luggage downstairs to the bus. The trip takes about an hour depending on traffic and crosses the famous Tsing Ma Bridge (the world鈥檚 longest road and rail suspension bridge!). You arrive at what looks like a mall in downtown Kowloon, in the Mong Tok district (excellent for shopping and local markets.)The foyer is plush. Check-in was efficient and the staff friendly and welcoming. It鈥檚 when you get to your room that you are disappointed. We reserved a de luxe room on the net, which we thought would be OK. It was not. We were offered a larger room at check-in (First clue) for an additional 700+ HK$, including internet and executive club access. The room is cramped, the bed a tad hard, and the bathroom small. The bathroom is actually a glass box. (The bellman helpfully shows you the blind between the bathroom and the bedroom that you pull down if you don鈥檛 want to watch your partner showering or whatever!) The washbasin and surround is glass, so you need to keep your wits about placing items in the bathroom. The closet is also small but there is a usefully large safe.The hotel has a superb restaurant with excellent Chinese menus and excellent service, and good wine list (Take a coat or sweater to counter HK鈥檚 Arctic AC). Breakfast, which is excellent, comes at 385 HK$ for two. As elsewhere in Asia, except Japan, internet is not free 鈥?although there is a computer suite, with free access, on the third floor. The hotel staff is friendly, helpful, and numerous. The concierge staff will provide you with helpful advice on places to visit and how to get there. As with other hotels in HK, the hotel is connected to a huge mall and MTR (rapid transit) station. Even so, we will probably use the Peninsula or the Shangri-la (on Hong Island Island), if we return to Hong Kong.One really great deal at the hotel is their 1-hour free evening tour of the Mong Tok markets and shopping areas (wet market, ladies鈥?market, flower market, electronics.) Don鈥檛 miss it. It鈥檚 a bargain. Mong Tok is VERY crowded 鈥?always. So, keep the map provided by the hotel handy.Apart from shopping in the Mong Tok area, during the two days we stayed in HK, we took the Star Ferry鈥檚 (Victoria) Harbour tour (Hopping Pass). Check out the Clock Tower at the terminal. If you are lucky, you will see some junks on the harbour. Also cross the harbour from Kowloon and take the tram up from Central MTR station on Hong Kong Island up to Victoria peak for a great view of the harbour. Travelling round HK is easy. Despite the warnings about taxis, we had no problems: they are cheap, efficient, and in abundance. But the MTR is really the way to go. Also cheap, clean, efficient - and faster than taxi. If you need change for the ticket machines, the customer services staff provides it. Take the MTR to Tung Chung on Lantau Island, near the airport, where you can take the memorable cable car ride up to the Giant Buddha, Po Lin Monastery and Chinese鈥搒tyle village at Ngong Ping (one of the best attractions in HK).

<Content>Loved Langham Place Having arrived on an early morning flight from Sydney, we were delighted to find our room available.We had booked the hotel after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, and were not disappointed. Whilst the hotel is out of the main area for tourist hotels, there is very much the feeling of being in the middle of real Hong Kong life. Street markets are just around the corner. Access to other areas by public transport is easy, as the MTR station is nearby. Taxi fare to the harbour area is little more than 拢2.We booked a 'Club' room, which also gave access to the Club lounge for breakfast and snacks. We had meals at 'The Place' and 'Ming Court' restaurants, both of which were of a good standard.The bedroom was a good size by Hong Kong standards. The room was clean, comfortable and well equipped. The bed was blissfully comfortable - I would love to have brought it home with me.I found all staff in the hotel courteous and helpful. Service was prompt and efficient, but not intrusive. I would love to return to this hotel again.

<Content>Loved it! This place was great. At first I had been a little apprehensive about staying here as I thought it was too far from Hong Kong Island and reports of the area put me off. However I experienced no problems at all, HK Island is 10 mins away on the MTR and the hotel is adjacent to the station. Also no evidence of red light district etc. Mong Kok is a great area full of markets and the hotel is part of a complex which includes restaurants and a cinema. Staff were great, room was immaculate with a great view from my room on the 32nd floor!!The hotel offers its guests a free tour of the area to get themselves acquainted with the city with hints at where to go, what to eat etc. If you're going to Hong Kong this hotel is worth considering!

<Content>Incredible attention to detail I think this hotel will probably be the standard we use for all hotels we stay at in the future. It was our 40th Wedding anniversary and so I had decided on a cruise, with 5 days at the Langham Place to start with. We booked their limousine service from the airport, and we were met by a hotel representative who gave us maps and bottled water while we waited a couple of minutes for the Limo to arrive. Baggage loaded, we were driven directly to the ground floor entrance where we were met by a group of bell-hops to take care of our luggage, whilst an assistant then took us up to the 36th floor to Club L, got us a glass of champagne each and sorted out our room cards. As all drinks and food are free in Club L. we stayed a couple of hours talking with other guests before retiring at 1 a.m. to our suite on the 37th floor, which I have to say was much larger than I had imagined possible in Hong Kong. Waiting for us was a free bottle of chmpagne on ice, a presentation platter of cocolate coated strawberries, and a plate of chocolate leaves on sugar. It was the first time we have had a suite with two restrooms (toilets for Brits). There was a lounge area with a 42 gas plasma and the usual hotel entertainment channels, a bar area with fridge and coffee/tea making facilities, a single toilet, then a seperate bedroom with a kingsize bed and even a menu for pillows. Attached to the bedroom is a glass bathroom (with motorised blinds for privacy) and more than adequate wardrobes. Again there was a 37 plasma on the wall. By the side of the bed was a clock/radio with an I-Pod docking station and a remote for the I-pod. The telphone system in the room allows you to take a small handset with you around the hotel.Although a continental breakfast was available in Club L, we opted for the breakfast in The Place, which had a fantastic selection, similar to that on a cruise ship - something for most nationalities including bacon, eggs, sausages, beans, mushrooms and hash browns with toast.They say the devil is in the detail, and on the day of our 40th, we dined in the Ming Court. The staff are so attentive that they must have noticed my wife is left-handed, and moved her chopsticks and glass over to her left hand. Only a small thing, but very impressed that they noticed. We used the pool on the roof (accesible through the Spa) which was really nice, however they could do with waiter service on sunny days, although towels and comfortable sunbeds were available. The concierge was excellent, we asked him to recommend a good steak restaraunt. and he sent us to Mortens of Chicago in the Sheraton Hotel next to The Peninsula on the waterfront. Again fantastic service and great ambience. The bill was astronomic - $HK2700 for wine and two main courses ($US370, 拢180) but the taxi back was incredibly cheap ($US3.00, 拢1.50) for a 15 minute journey. Travelling around is very cheap - get an Octopus card for $HK150 which includes $HK50 deposit, use it all week, and then take it back and they refund the unused part and the deposit. The Langham Place is in a great area for walking around - Mong Kok feels and looks properly Chinese unlike Hong Kong island which felt like the financial district of a capital city, not much local atmosphere. We also felt very safe.Shopping was really no cheaper than the UK, but if you need tailored clothing, visit Eddie Siu on Hanoi Road, T.S.T Kowloon. Proper Chinese tailor and everything I bought is perfect. I bought a made-to-measure jacket from an Asian tailor which although very cheap ($150, 拢75) is nowhere near the same quality.Checkout at the Langham Place was a breeze as they sort everytthing out in Club L. We stayed another day on our return from the cruise in a normal room which although smaller was still a reasonable size and well appointed.I would recommend this hotel without reserve. From umbrellas to bathrobes, they think of everything .Martin Tetlow

<Content>Wonderful hotel We stayed 3 nights in a club room. Every thing about the hotel was great. The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The club lounge was 1st class and it's well worthwhile paying extra for a club room.The location of the hotel is very good. You really get a feel for the real Hong Kong being in Mong Kok. Access to the subway is very easy and we had no trouble getting to all other parts of Hong Kong.Compared to other 5 star hotels in Hong Kong, the Langham Place was wonderful value for money. Deserves its number one spot.

<Content>A bit of luxury in a not so luxurious location Wow! The Langham Place was fantastic. The service was impeccable, the room although small was very nicely decorated and all our needs catered for - we even had a coffee peculator in our room with fresh ground coffee! The swimming pool was stunning, towering over the buildings and looking out to the harbour (if you could see that far due to the smog).Our daughter became unwell during our stay and the staff couldn't do enough for us. The buffet breakfast was very nice with a good selection to keep most people happy.The location was a little bit out of the way but we were very close to the markets. The Langham Place is a great place to stay if you don't mind walking.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed in the Langham Place for three nights on the 9th of March, as the start of our holiday, as we were moving on to a cruise.As the hotel is not in the heart of Hong Kong, and we were a little worried that we may have some problems in getting around. This was not to be, as there were many ways of getting around. The train station was close by, which took ten minutes to get to Hong Kong. We even took the bus for two Hong Kong dollars and got the starr ferry across the harbour to Hong Kong.The hotel is connected to a mall, which has a good selection of shops and a good food hall, if you want to eat quite cheap.There is a market very close by called the ladies market, which is good for the odd bargin, ( and is not just for the ladies ).The hotel offers excellent value, and the staff were always very helpful all the time. We stayed in the L club section, which you can use the service of the club lounge, which always has snacks and drinks available.The room was very comfortable and had a spectacular view of Mongkok. I would recommend the up grade to the L club, as the rooms are far bigger and you get to the use of the club benefits.We hope to one day to go back to Hong Kong, and when we do, we will be staying at the Langham Place Hotel.

<Content>OK Hotel I stayed at Langham Place from 27 - 29 March 2008. On arrival I was told that the room I had booked was not available and that I had been upgraded to an executive room but with twin beds instead of a kingsize bed which would be replaced the next day. However after arriving back to hotel after a day of touring the twin beds had not been exchanged for kingsize bed as previously promised. We rang reception and had to change rooms to one with king size bed.Also the kettle fused the electrics twice and we had to have a new kettle delivered to ensure no further power failiures.The price of the mini bar is over priced and the cost for making phonecalls is quite steep too. We rang Macau (only one hour away) and were charged 50 HKD for a very short call.Staff are friendly enough, but don't see why so many people seem to go overboard with there praise for this hotel. It's just an ok hotel and I presonally would rate it 4 star rather than 5.Also Mongkok MTR is not on the island line so usually requires transfers to get to the main places.Jason Wallace

<Content>Phenomenally good experience Cannot praise the Langham Place highly enough. Hotel staff extremely polite, welcoming and efficient. I'd booked a car to collect me at the airport - the hotel has a desk in arrivals, and there I was met with smiles and presented with a soft drink and a Sony PSP playing an informative video about the hotel, which I watched in a very nice Mercedes during the half-hour transfer to the city. We upgraded our room on arrival to a Club room - this was located on the 35th floor with views out over Kowloon and the harbour. The upgrade also gave us access to the Club L lounge on the 36th floor, which more than offset any extra costs associated with the upgrade as it served light breakfasts and snacks throughout the day, as well as complimentary drinks, tea and coffee. Club L also has free internet access and its own concierge/receptionist. Room was lovely - a tad smaller than I'd expected but with top-quality features. Bathroom lovely with a big shower and a deep bath which was very welcome after long days spent sightseeing. Nice toiletries, and stuff like combs, shaving kits, toothbrushes etc available. Room had an iron and ironing board as well as a little laundry basket. Didn't need to get any laundry done so can't comment on the prices. Bed was extremely comfortable and great selection of pillows available, including hypoallergenic. An iPod dock with speakers was provided, as was a DVD player. Flat screen TV was impressive and channel choice very good, but took some time to respond to remote control! Phone system very swanky but watch out for very high costs when calling internationally. We felt safe in Mongkok although there are a few back streets that might be a little dodgy after dark if female and walking alone. Hotel is beside a huge shopping centre which has a supermarket in the basement and a 7-11 on the ground floor. It's also very close to some of the night markets - the hotel operates a free guided tour every evening at 6pm which lets you get your bearings as regards local shopping. Would recommend the Temple Street night market which is a little way from the hotel but well worth seeing. For electronics go to any branch of Fortress - they are excellent.Getting to/around Hong Kong from the hotel was simple - there's an MTR (metro) station in the basement of the adjacent shopping centre and HK Central is just a few stops south. Buy an Octopus transport card in any MTR station for 150 dollars (about 14 euro) and it'll last you several days/trips and can be topped up with cash. Tip - there's another Langham hotel in Kowloon so do make sure to bring the hotel address with you in both English and Chinese if you're planning on taking taxis as sometimes the drivers get them mixed up. I had need of a dentist on the third day of my stay and the assistant manager personally lined up an appointment for me - this was scheduled for just 90 mins after my having phoned reception for help. (Dentist in question was excellent and very reasonably priced). Finally, hotel spa was absolutely wonderful. It's on the top two floors of the hotel and there's a lovely outdoor heated pool with a small bar, as well as a very well-appointed gym. I booked a flight recovery massage for the night I arrived and it was great; also had a facial done later in the week. All in all, super service and a very relaxing stay at the Langham Place. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Deffinately worth a stay! We would recommend staying at the Langham Place Hotel as we enjoyed a couple of nights there on our way to Oz. The hotel is well situated near the MTR station for sightseeing and generally getting about. We had booked the cheaper option of room and were badgered by reception to upgrade. We didn't succumb to their offers and were pleasantly surprised by the lovely basic room. The service was extremely good, with all the little touches that make your stay special. (Slippers by the bed and chocolates as a welcome gift, to name just a couple of things.) The staff were all very friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough to make our stay enjoyable. We appreciated all the fine aspects of this hotel and would especially recommend the fantastic spa. WOW! What a fabulous experience! Don't forget to go to the top floor to see the most incredible view of Hong Kong.

<Content>Very very nice hotel! Just returned from 6 nights at the Langham Place Hotel in Mongkok, with my fiance, which was very nice and offered a different experience from staying on the isand or Kowloon waterfront. Mongkok is more of a locals area and really gives you the feel of what it is like to live in Hong Kong. The hotel offers a free 20 minute guided tour every evening which I would recommend to get a feel for the markets/shops in the area.We used the gym/pool facilities almost every day and my fiance also went for a traditional chinese massage, 1 hour, which she said was very good (she's doing a part time sports massage course).We stayed in a superior rooms which means that we stayed above the 25th floor and I think it is worth it as the hotel has wonderful views which are be best seen from 25 and up (the Langham Place shopping mall might restrict views for certain lower rooms but I can't be sure of that)The hotel was very good and would stay there again.

<Content>Faultless Stayed in a Club L room for 5 nights, and I can't think of a single complaint. The room was smallish but well thought out, so it didn't feel cramped at all. The bed was probably the most comfortable I've slept in. The huge flatscreen TV could be watched from the bath, thanks to the glass wall on the bathroom. The club was great - the best in any hotel I've stayed in. Drinks served all day, with sparkling wine until 6pm and then Mumm until 1am. There was a lavish afternoon tea and good canapes in the evening, followed by a dessert buffet. There were plenty of computers and two great massage chairs. Continental breakfast was served in the lounge, or you could choose the very comprehensive breakfast service in the main restaurant (incl dim sum, miso soup, sushi, congee on top of the usual staples).The staff were great - we didn't have one unpleasant experience. Contrary to some reports, I found the staff to be more genuine and friendly than in many large hotels. In addition, the turn down service was so comprehensive they cleaned the bathroom! This is a bit environmentally indulgent, but it is very luxurious to have a clean bathroom and dry towels for both your evening and morning showers. The pool facilities are very nice, with steam room, sauna and oriental hot tub in the change rooms, as well as a jacuzzi next to the pool. The gym was really good, with plenty of equipment, personal tvs on the machines and great views.We found the location to be ideal - Mong Kok is definitely a less touristy area that Tsim Sha Tsui or Central, which for us was a bonus. The MRT is in the same building as the hotel, but it is actually quite an interesting walk down to Tsim Sha Tsui from the hotel. We enjoyed walking to the Temple St night markets for excellent seafood, and from there it is another short walk to the many outdoor bars of Knutsford Terrace. The mall below the hotel is a shopping destination in its own right. Will definitely stay at the Langham Place again - it was a faultless experience.

<Content>An unexpectedly lovely and convenient place to stay We had hesitations about staying in a hotel in the Mong Kok area as we had heard that it wasn't the best part of town.To our surprise and delight this was proven to be not the case .Mong Kok allowed us to glimpse an interesting part of town ; the morning walks to the bird garden , flower , goldfish and wet markets were fascinating. Sure it isn't a salubrious location , however the Hotel and the shopping centre beneath it is very new and architecturally interesting, so it allowed you to retreat back to a more contemporary space at the end of the day. Our tarriff included the use of the L Club  which we would highly recommend.( Nice views to enjoy your drinks and tapas ) Having a MTR station close to the hotel was useful,.The level of service and and the hotel environment was excellent.

<Content>WOW! What a way to start our honeymoon! We started our honeymoon to Vietnam with a two night stopover in Hong Kong. Langham Place was our Splurge for the trip and are we were not dissapointed! The hotel is beautiful and the room (Executive room) was very nicely laid out. Amazing bathroom! and a great view of MongKok. We enjoyed drinks at the bar and do to jet lag was able to take advantage of early morning swims on the top of the roof. what a way to start the day! Knowing it was our honeymoon the Hotel gave us a free bottle of bubbly and we discovered a wonderful view in the hotel spa and camped out with the bottle to watch the Hong Kong Light show, toast our new marriage and take in the view. The area was great to walk around and shop and there was great Dim Sum across the street. The ease of the metro was also great. Stay here! If you book early there are some great deals on the website.

<Content>Fantastic hotel and not easy to please Stayed in this hotel on our outward bound journey to NZ for two nights and again for two nights on our return flight to UK. The hotel services are fantastic as is the club lounge - well worth upgrading to. The hotel is immaculate, the facilities are great, the staff are very helpful. The hotel is centrally situated and is very close to the clean and efficient MTR. Hong Kong can be overpowering, its energy is intoxicating. However, the Langham Place provides an oasis in which to relax.The only embarrasing aspect from my point of view was the manner in which some of the 'business' guests no doubt on company expenses spoke to the staff who were always excellent in their manner, helpfulness and kindness. This is a wonderful hotel, dont miss the opportunity to stay there. Very good value for money. An affordable luxury seldom seent these days.

<Content>Great Hotel,great location Great Hotel and the location was also brilliant. The Hotel is connected to a shopping mall which also has an MTR station (subway). by using the MTR you can travel directly to hong kong island in about 10mins and its very cheap and easy to use. you can also explore the surrounding streets which have night markets and great places to eat out ,shop etc. overall we found the hotel great as the hotel is a very high standard facility plus the location allows you easy access to Mongkok and Kowloon and also its very easy to get to Hong Kong island from the hotel.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, and good exercise too! This hotel was absolutely fabulous - very marble and glass (if that's your sort of thing of course!). The room was very nice indeed - with a rather strange glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom (there is a blind!). We didn't try the restaurant but the bar was relaxing and we even enjoyed the singer. However, the location is not great as there is quite a walk to get to the water-front.

<Content>Good value  Spent 3 nights here from 1 March 2008. Excellent location-very close to MTR  you can buy an Urban Pass that allows you to travel on all MTR lines for 1 day for 50 HK Dollars (about 拢3.35). You can reach the waterfront in 10-15 mins. Hotel attached to shopping mall with lots of cafes  restaurants so you can eat cheaply if you don't want to pay hotel prices. We ate buffet breakfast in hotel-very wide choice of food, tasty  good value. had 1 meal in the bar which was also good. Room comfortable, staff helpful  polite.

<Content>Good Hotel but not a 5 star I had a fine stay at the Langham Place Hotel but I was slightly disappointed with the size of the hotel room on arrival. It was a standard room and it was very small. I was able to upgrade to a studio suite (for extra cost) which was much more similar to a 5 star hotel room. The staff was warm and helpful. The facility is new and the rooms are very clean and nicely appointed. I highly recommend the pool on the roof and the spa-both are first rate. The restaurants in the hotel were very good-the price of the buffet breakfast was expensive.( We opted to get in a cab and have breakfast at the Intercontiental Hotel that overlooks the water and city for roughly the same price). I am not sure I would stay here again-the location is not great for a tourist. I spent a lot of time on the metro or in a cab. I think I would have better off in Central. The rooms are cheaper due to the location versus other 5 star hotels but ,frankly, this is not a 5 star hotel. Other 4 star hotels are the same price in but have better locations.

<Content>Great hotel, shame about check-in We have just returned from a week's stay at Langham Place in Mongkok. We had a lovely time apart from a bad experience at check-in.We took the limo transfer from the airport to the hotel where we were offered soft drinks and newspapers and were given a PSP with a video presentation about the hotel. The staff at the airport and the driver were helpful and friendly.Once at the hotel, the check-in was quick and easy, but we did not find the staff particularly welcoming or pleasant. On leaving the lift at our floor, we noticed a strong smell of smoke and on entering our room we found it also to smell and have an ash-tray and matches. We booked our room well in advance, at the time requesting a non-smoking room and reconfirmed this the day before we travelled. We were not told at check-in that no non-smoking rooms were available and were allocated a smoking room. We called the S.M.A.R.T Centre (guest helpline) and were told that no other rooms were available and they would send cleaners to carry out an air treatment within the next ten minutes. After waiting for 45 minutes with no sign of the cleaners, we went directly to reception to try and get the matter sorted. They were suprised that the cleaners had not arrived and offered to send the cleaners back immediately. We didn't think this was acceptable after waiting so long, and asked to be moved to another room. After another 10 minutes of two members of staff looking at the computer and talking to each other in Chinese, a non-smoking room suddenly became available. Although this room was on a lower level, we had no choice but to accept it as we were tired after 13 hours of travelling and just wanted to get to our room. No real apology was made apart from a sorry for the inconvenience as we left to go to the new room. It was not the level of service we would expect from this standard of hotel.Our room was lovely as other reviewers have described. We booked an Executive room which we found to be of a good size with lots of storage space, which was handy as we were staying a week. The bed was very big and extremely comfy with lots of extra of pillows. The bathroom had an amazing walk-in shower and separate bath with plenty of amenities, e.g. toothbrush, razor, cottonwool, comb etc. The glass wall was an excellent idea to see the view or TV from your bath, but also had a blind if you wanted privacy. Cleanliness was of a very high standard.We had breakfast at the hotel every day. The restaurant was a lovely setting with a huge choice of western and asian food. We particularly liked the chefs who were very friendly and jolly. Breakfast closes promptly at 10.30 which the waiting staff remind you at 10.15 by pointing at their watch and bringing olive oil to the table ready for lunch!The location of the hotel was excellent and unlike other reviews, we did not find the area scary at all. We liked that we were surrounded by locals and it wasn't too touristy. The MTR station was just outside the hotel, also accessible through the adjoining mall. The mall was very modern with a huge of range of shops and restaurants and a mini supermarket in the basement.Overall, the hotel itself and its location were faultless. The staff, particuarly the chefs, concierge, housekeeping, doormen and pink ladies were extremely friendly and helpful, but were let down by the indifferent check-in staff.

<Content>Absolutely Sensational What can I about the Langham Place - basically this hotel left me speechless. Service - ImpeccableFood - AmazingRoom- The best I have ever stayed inStaff - Very friendlyLocation - AwesomeWe arrived about 10am into hong kong and got the langham place which towers over Kowloon.Upon arrival, we checked in and asked for an upgrade to the club room - for $150 extra (TOTAL) we got upgraded to a huge room on the 36th floor looking over the entire area of Kowloon and looking down directly to all of the night markets. The bed was very comfortable and huge too and the bathroom was amazing.The club facilities where outstanding, with a large variety of food and drinks on offer - Grey Goose vodka, woo hoo, massage chairs and a check out service.Breakfast was included in the room rate in the lobby restaurant, which after some confusion with some eager staff cleaning my table thinking i had left, i enjoyed immensely. The langham is perched on top of a relatively large shopping centre which is handy for some late night purchase or food, and the hotel is very close to the mong kok subway station taking you to all of the major stops and sights in HK.Overall, i highly recommend this hotel - i guarantee you will love it.

<Content>Luxury, courtesy and the best hotel I've ever visited. My friend and I stayed here for 11 nights in a twin room. It was small but beautifully furnished and the staff could not have been more helpful and efficient. From the moment we walked into the Reception area we were treated like honoured guests, nothing was too much trouble for the staff. From the lift ladies to the pool attendants, they were a delight. Halfway through our trip, on a public holiday, my friend became ill and needed the attention of a doctor and an injection. The hotel arranged all this for us and we had an english-speaking doctor at our room within 2 hours. The facilities at the hotel were wonderful, the roof-top pool was perfect after a long day's shopping and the restaurant breakfasts were fantastic. The location of the hotel was great too. We had been to Hong Kong before and knew that the MTR (like the Tube or the Metro) was clean, easy to navigate and wonderfully convenient - the station for the MTR is at the bottom of the shopping mall which ajoins the hotel. So you can get off the plane, on to the train and go to your hotel within an hour. The mall was open late (shops in HK often don't open until around 10am but stay open till about 11pm) and the food courts there were fantastic. The concierge was also very helpful with hints on good restaurants to visit and information about opening hours and travel choices.We saved up for our trip for years and we did worry that our expectations would be too high for any holiday to live up to. The Langham hotel exceeded all of them, from the DVD player and the complimentary water, to the delicious room service burgers when we got hungry in the middle of the night, to the doormen who translated for us with the taxi drivers. I plan to return to HK in a couple of years, I'll be staying here again. (In fact, I've stayed at another Langham - Auckland - since and it is just as delightful.)

<Content>An Oasis in the Heart of Kowloon The Langham Place Hotel is an oasis in the middle of crowded Mongkok (which is completely safe by almost any measure). The hotel is beautifully decorated and furnished in both the public areas and rooms. Especially of note are the Executive Floor, which operates 24 hours a day and more than worth the added cost, and the Spa, which is a destination unto itself.The only negative that comes to mind is that many of the staff must be working very hard as few ever smiled or greeted guests when passing them.All in all, a highly recommended property if Kowloon is where you want to be.

<Content>Loved the Langham It is not surprising that The Langham Place in Hong Kong is ranked at number 1. We spent 5 days at the LP during our honeymoon. We booked the hotel limo service to and from the airport via dealing directly with the hotel. All communication with the hotel was fast, efficient and professional. Finding the hotel desks at the airport is a bit of a challenge. As a tip, walk straight through the arrivals hall and all the hotel desks are situated on the very far right hand corner, right at the back. We spent a good while finding it! The cost of the hotel limi is 550 HKD each way (around 33 GBP). We checked in on the club level and were given a beautiful suite on the 36th floor. We took advantage of the 'Suite Dreams' package and I think its definately good value for money. The Club Level is certainly worth the extra cost. It's lovely to have somewhere to go when you are jet lagged and need a snack at 3am! Non alcoholic drinks are provided 24/7 and alcoholic drinks during most of the day - a few hours in the early morning when they are not provided.The rooms are absolutely beautiful. Our suite was complete with 2 bathrooms, 2 big plasma screens, a massive bed and 5 telephones throughout! The rooms were made up in the morning and then given a quick once over in the evening (fresh towels and turn down service). We had a view over the city and can look down into the bustling streets below. Breakfast was included with the deal. You can either have continental breakfast at the Club Level or in the main restaurant 'The Place'. We only ate at The Place and the selection and service was exceptional. There is a good mix between Chinese fare and more traditional breakfast items (fresh omlettes, bacon, hash browns, fruit, toast etc).Also included as part of the package was a spa treatment. My husband and I both had wonderful hour long massage treatments at their beautiful spa on the 41st floor. The gym at the hotel was also amazing. Definately the best gym I've ever seen at a hotel. All the equipment was modern, clean and the cardio equipment was near the window overlooking the city.One of the best assets to the hotel are the staff. The hotel is very professionally run and is apparent that their staff are trained very well. One other reviewer commented on the youthfullness of the staff. This is certainly something we noted as well.Agreed, the location is somewhat out of the way, but it does provide an element of authenticity being in a heavily populated local area. We did not take the underground to get around, instead we did a local tour which we booked via the hotel concerige. It was the half day Hong Kong Island Orientation tour. The cost was 320 HKD each. I think this is well worth it as it takes you to Victoria Peak and Stanley Market as some of the highlights. We found Stanley Market somewhat disappointing compared the ladies market which is just 2 blocks from the hotel. But then again, we were visiting during Chinese New Year and some of the shops were closed.The hotel is also connected to a large shopping mall. This is great for quick and inexpensive meal options.Overall, 10 out of 10 for the Langham Place. We will definately be back next time we are in Hong Kong.

<Content>First Class in every way. We stayed 5 days at Langham Place in a beautiful Club room. As others have noted, if you can, DO pay a bit more for a truly first class experience. We had a spacious room on the 35th floor. The bed was SO comfortable  there's a pillow menu if you're not happy with the several types of pillows already provided. The bathroom is big and immaculately clean. We loved the huge showerhead directly above. The bathroom has a big window into the bedroom but there is a privacy blind. The separate bathtub was a good size. Toiletries included were of excellent quality and quantity. They even provided tootbrushes, combs,  razors.The view was of the high rise highly concentrated exciting city. Unfortunately the weather was dull with low hanging clouds the entire time we were there. We felt perfectly safe in the area and liked being close to various markets. To go to the harbour we just hopped in a taxi which is metered and reasonably priced. We also used the clean and effiecient undergound trains.Hong Kong was the last stop of a long and fanatstic journey. We decided to splurge and be spoilt by staying at Club level. It was really worth the money. The Club lounge had non stop food and drinks. We hardly ate out as the food provided was delicious and satisfying. The Lounge really was a relaxed and refined place to spend time. There are a couple of massage chairs (free) which were heavenly! We also used the computers in the Lounge area to check emails etc. We had breakfast downstairs and agree that the area is too cold. The buffet had a very good selection but we do regret not trying breakfast at the Club lounge - that will be for our next time there!The staff were friendly and professional at all times. Every part of the hotel gleamed. For Hong Kong we think think we got good value for our money. We highly recommend the Club rooms at this wonderful hotel for a first class experience.

<Content>Decent value for the money in pricey H.K. While I'm less euphoric than some or other recent reviwers this is undeniably a well functioning hotel. I do have a slight problem with the location. While by no means remote, it is a good cab or subway ride to the scene of most of the action, the reason we come to H.K. Yes, the Mong Kok station is quite close, but one still has to buy a ticket, get to the platform and often stand in the jam packed cars. Mind you, the fare is cheap and the cars modern and clean, but it's still a subway. The service at this ultra modern hotel is excellent: fast, efficient and invariably friendly. The club lounge is one of the best I've ever encountered and well worth the additional cost. I must confess that I like the idea of getting a chilled beer--or any other beverage for that matter (with alcohol or sans) at, say, 1 p.m rather than wait for the freebies at 5:30 or 6 p.m. A generous and wise policy on the part of hotel management. We occupied an executive suite on the 39th floor which, while not huge, was well configured and even had a small kitchen (kitchenette). The view was nothing special, but that partly relected the room location and lousy weather (heavy overcast). One minor complaint was the over airconditioned lobby and restaurant where breakfast is served ( the first two mornings we foolishly skipped the lounge, thinking it would not be as elaborate. Big mistake: it was even better than downstairs and the classy, intimate atmosphere made the occasion much more relaxing, not to mention it wasn't freezing). Would I return? Very possibly, but after 7 visits to H.K. (my first in Oct. '56) I've grown a bit tired of the place. It's become very pricey and--maybe I'm showing my age--too frenetic as well. Moreover the shopping is either too high-end or real kitchy (Mong Kok). Lastly, the air quality, never its long suit, has really deteriorated. Yet if you've never been there (is there anyone who hasn't?), it remains--not unlike Vegas--a must. But for my money, if given the choice, Victoria Island or harborside Kowloon would be a better locale, especially for the first time visitor. Herb Hallman  Denver, CO

<Content>Great hotel - except for location We chose the Langham Place because of the reviews on Tripadvisor and we were delighted with it. Our only negative comment would be the location - it is in a rundown area and the checkout questionnaire of the hotel actually asks guests whether they 'felt safe' walking out of the hotel. The answer is that we did not, especially as tourists are warned to be wary of pickpockets.In the event, we had no problems but the next time, I think we would try the sister hotel, the Langham, which is much nearer the ferry terminal and other attractions. Incidentally, we were surprised how little English some taxi drivers could understand. We only discovered on our second day that the hotel can provide a small booklet listing numerous likely destinations, including the hotel itself, in Chinese script. This was very helpful.

<Content>The best! We stayed for 2 nights in Feb 08 on the way to NZ. We got a special deal on a suite after seeing the chance of this opportunity on a report from a Tripadvisor review. We paid HK$2250/night for a suite on the Club foor, booked on the hotel website. Absolutely great. Staff friendly, helpful without being overbearing. Did the free hotel night market tour - excellent tour guide. Recommend doing this on your first day - good intro to the Mong Kok area which has real atmosphere.Food on Club floor was superb.Aleady booked our stay for the way back!

<Content>enjoyable experience We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights recently and it proved to be a most enjoyable experience. We arrived off a cruise ship quite early in the morning with no real expectation of being able to check in until the afternon, but the super efficient club room manager Eunice managed to find us a room and we therefore unpacked by 11am. Do book a club rom if yoo can afford it, the staff are more like personal concierges, the snacks lovely and the drink free flowing.One thing we noticed was the relatative youth of the staff,the hotel seems to be run by young people, but how well trained they are, you are always acknowledged, engaged in conversation and made to feel that you are the most important guests in the hotel.The hotel has excellent restaurants and a great spa, shame there is no indoor swimming pool as it was a little chilly when we were there.The hotel is also well situated, Mongkok is one of the more interesting areas of Kowloon, well situated for markets and the station.All in all this was a wonderful stay, the hotel is well aware of its no1 Tripadvisor rating and clearly wishes to hold on to that position. It fully deserves to remain at the top

<Content>second stay- and i will return This was my second stay@ Langham Place and as the first stay earlier in 2007 i enjoyed it very much. Location wise it is just perfect as the hotel is connected to a mall as well as the public transport. I do use public transport as often as possible and i have to say it is pretty easy to reach the hotel from the airport. The roof top pool as well as the wellness area are top notch. Rooms do have wonderful views over the city. We do had room service and as it was christmas we had a special order for christmas eve dinner. The chef called me back to reconfirm my order and discussed the dishes. I haven't thought that they where able to match my orders- but they do!Quality of breakfast is also amazing- do not miss it. The concierge handled our ordered x-mas gifts very well- thank you so much!The relaxed atmosphere of the staff at all makes also younger guests feel comfortable.I will return!

<Content>Lived up to being no. 1 We stayed in the Langham Hotel for 2 nights at the end of December and it was fantastic. This was the start of a four week trip and it couldn't have started better. We had decided to book the Langham following the reviews on trip advisor and it certainly lived up to it's no. 1 position! The room was spacious, immaculate and the beds were extremely comfortable. The staff were incredibly courteous, polite and attentive without being intrusive. We ate in the hotel bar and the food was very good and reasonably priced. The location is great, so close to the underground and it's also very easy and cheap to get taxis to and from central or to the harbour. We used to concierge service to book tickets for a cruise on the harbour to watch the evening light show - well worth it.There is a beautiful open air swimming pool on the roof and the spa looked amazing although we didn't have time to try out any of the treatments.We booked with the hotel directly and the room was extremely good value.I would love to go back to Hong Kong and would definitely stay at the Langham again.

<Content>As city hotels go........ Slap bang in the middle of Mong Kok, 25 mins from the airport is this impressive structure connected to a shopping mall which is at best average by HK's high shopping standards.Check in on a Thursday evening was rapid we chose this hotel on kowloon side as we were there for business. This hotel was The Business.StaffImmediate upgrade to larger triple with excellent views. Reception staff were first class, concierge service was equally as gracious with an ambundance of local knowledge from advice as to where to get a good pint to the best place for toys, complete with a beware the quality reminder. I did require a doctor whilst there as I had forgot to pack some cruical medication that was available on prescription only. The duty manager spoke to me in person and advised me to go to my room whilst he sorted this out within 5 minutes I was on the phone to the hotels sub contracted doctor who advised me to travel to see him as it would be quicker and cheaper. From pressing the lift buttons for you to helping you in and out of taxi's, to there genuine pleasure in serving you. This was a refreshing change and something staff at the supposed super resorts in Dubai (I have Madinat Jumeirah in Mind) should take note of. Truly truly gob smacking pioneering customer service with little touches everywhere, amazing gracious service.The room, all mod cons, plasma, dvd, stereo, wireless keyboard for the internet (chargeable), quiet and reliable air con, nice window seat built into the ledge, reasonable min bar prices, pillow menu, slippers, gown etc. The rooms are fresh, crisp, well maintained, bathrooms are spacious enough and the 'open' bathroom is easily rectified by simply drawing the blinds.Restaurants and bars Very good from bar snacks, to the chinese (Ming Court I think?) restaurant the food quality is good. You do have an awful amount of choice within the attached shopping centre from mcdonalds, deli france, pizzas so if you are budgeting and saving cash for the shops its pitched well for you.LocationDon't be put off by Mong Kok. Its not rough by Uk standards its quite charming and has a chinese bustle to it. You are safe and there are more than enough shops in the immediate locality for you to have a browse around. There is a shortage of good local bars however but don't worry. Its only 60-80 HKD to the Wan Chai bars and central. Again same price to the Mall at Harbour city which is a good one in my opinion. You can also use the MTR which is 4 mins from the hotel. Clean, fast and efficient a pleasure to use, journey time into central/ causeway bay 10 mins max. You can also use the star ferry(pennies) on the Kowloon side which will drop you island side adjacent to harbour city mall which is a good spot to take the classic harbour panoramic photo. I have no qualms about staying Kowloon side the hotels tend to be cheaper.OverallI've been a very lazy trip advisor for years. I should have posted reviews about the Atlantis Bahamas, Loewes Miami beach, Mina A Salam Dubai, Westin Times Square New York, numerous eastern shangri la's. This hotel beats the pants off them and I will be using them again in April/mayThis Hotel its not a beach resort if it was the sand would be raked hourly men would clean your sunglasses every 15 minutes, fruit cocktails on sticks, cucumbers for the eyes etc. The hotel and its staff are excellent go and enjoy a fantastic city hotel.Flights Virgin (Direct booking) Truly Rubbish service both ways and I like Virgin.Hotel Booked via expedia excellent rate, though Asiarooms.com had excellent rates for April 2008 when I last checked.

<Content>wonderful hotel Great place to stay in the real Hong Kong , surrounded by local markets and adjoining a modern shopping mall with its own Metro station, so getting around is very easy. Large modern rooms with views across the city , very comfortable with all the amenities you would expect. Amazing buffet breakfast ,with one of the largest selections we have ever seen, even including crab,prawns and chocolate fountains. I recoment the organized trip to Happy Vally races it includes a buffet dinner all your drinks a 50 HK Dollar starter bet, and all from the comfort of the Honk Kong jockey club headquaters overlooking the coarse, pluss a visit to the parade ring. Although we are not raceing fans this was an outstanding night and amazing value at 拢30 per person

<Content>Great hotel Stayed Jan 2-7, 2008. At first a little apprehensive - website looks great, but a little out of the way in Mongkok. But when you arrive, the room was great. Thoroughly modern, great views (we were on the 31st floor). The bed and pillows were the best I have slept in. I asked the hotel where to buy the pillows. Only drawback was the extra charge for in-room internet. However, the 5th floor had a number of internet terminals and most of the time we did not have to wait to use. Service staff were very polite and helpful.Was confused how to get from airport to hotel so emailed the hotel - response was fantastic with detailed maps depending on your choice of transportation. We chose the express bus. On leaving the hotel, we took a cab to the Kowloon station to grab the airport train (fast and cheap). Told them our choice and they registered our names with the bus desk. Easy.The hotel connected to a mall which was convenient as we ate breakfast there and had Starbucks there. The mall had many restaurants, including a pretty good dim sum (recommended). The dessert place was very good as well (also recommended).The location of the hotel, while initially I had misgivings, is not too bad. Close to the Mongkok MTR so convenient. Also close to the Mongkok East station which we took the MTR to Shenzhen for a day of shopping. Around the hotel are many shopping places. The street for shoes is close by as is the night market stalls. Also, many snack places if you like street food.

<Content>Fabulous Langham Place We stayed at the Langham Place Hotel for a 1 night stop-over on the way to Europe and it was lovely. We had initially booked a Quad room but upon check-in were advised that there was something wrong wtih the bathroom so were upgraded to 2 connecting rooms on 21st floor. The rooms were very comfortable and spacious enough. Staff very friendly.Langham is in a great location in the heart of bustling Mongkok and very conveniently connected to Mongkok rail station.Highly recommend the Langham Place Hotel!

<Content>Awesome! My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in this hotel and I have to say it has been the nicest city hotel so far. Their service leaves no wishes open and the staff is very helpful with everything. There are a couple of thing that really make this hotel outstanding. For one they offer a very comfortable bed, probably even more comfortable than the one we have at home. And I can also highly recommend their restaurant. It is an all-you-can-eat buffet and the food is very excellent, including fresh seafood. Whenever I will return to Hong Kong this will be my hotel of choice.

<Content>The Reviews Are true!! I chose this hotel based on the reviews from the TripAdvisor.com website. I was not disappointed.Just to be clear, this hotel is not located on Hong Kong Island (the postcard views of the big buildings). It is on the Kowloon side in a neighborhood called Mong Kok. The hotel could not be more convenient though. It is attached to a very modern mall (Langham Place Mall) and you can access the subway (MTR) from this Mall. The MTR will take you into Hong Kong Island (Admiralty stop or Central stop) for HK$ 10.50. The cost of transportation in Hong Kong is very reasonable (e.g. subways and taxis).The hotel is very well appointed and the staff could not be nicer. I was there for 6 days and the level of service stayed very high the entire stay.Make sure you check out the gym/spa on the 41st floor. The view from the Relaxation Corner is great. You can see the skyline of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island as well as the harbour. Every night at 8:00pm, the buildings on Hong Kong Island put on a light show. It is one of the world's great skyline views.There is a Starbucks and a McDonalds located in the Langham Place mall if you can't seem to leave the US behind. There are also some cool street markets in the neighborhoods around the hotel. You may never eat Chinese food again after visiting these markets, but they are definitely part of the Hong Kong experience.Make sure you take a trip to the South side of Hong Kong Island (Repulse Bay and Stanley). On a clear, sunny day, Stanley seems like Italy or Greece to me.Have a good time and stay at the Langham Place Hotel. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>Simply The Best! This property exceeded expectations.I stayed there for two nights recently with my husband and two teenagers on route to Canada and the States.We had booked almost one year earlier and received a fantastic rate which made our stay even more fabulous.Everything about this property was five star - the car service at the airport, the location, the Reception staff, the rooms and the restaurants. It was all terrific. Their Backyard restaurant Christmas winter wonderland (complete with artificial snow falling) was an unexpected delight.I must also mention the Executive Chef, Lorraine. Our daughter has a life threatening allergy to nuts. Lorraine's understanding, empathy and attention to detail were second to none. She went out of her way to ensure that our daughter was catered for in an exceptional manner. This absolutely made our visit to Hong Kong.We will recommend this property to our friends and will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Luxury hotel at an affordable price Wonderful hotel located very close to the mtr. Room was not large but just right. Bathroom was very clean. Hotel is connected to a very large mall. Booked the room early on the hotel's website and saved 10%. We had the deluxe room for 1 week and the executive room upgrade for one day. The only difference is a separate shower stall in the executive and slightly larger room. Concierge was very helpful with recommendations for food. We took the hotel shuttle bus which was 130 hkd which worked out well. Would stay here again if ever in HK again.

<Content>Great Value! My husband and I stayed here for three nights over Christmas and loved it. The hotel is very service-oriented, and we felt every one of our requests was well attended to. I definitely suggest purchasing club access, as it includes a substantial buffet breakfast every morning, along with wine, cocktails, beer and snacks in the afternoon and evening. It's a relaxing oasis to retreat to when the busy-ness of Mong Kok wears on the soul, especially after coming off a 16 hour flight. The location is a bit out of the way, but is an easy ride on the MTR (red line) to the southern tip of Kowloon or into Central.Would definitely go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed here for two nights in October and have to agree with most of what has already been written. The hotel is excellent, part of a big shopping mall and also right beside the buzzing and fascinating Mongkok. If you want to be down near Hong Kong itself with views of the bay then this is not the place to stay but we went down that part of the city several times quite easily by MTR or taxi and did not feel we were missing out by staying in Mongkok. In fact it was quite refreshing to be staying somewhere a little different. We were in a standard room but found it well above average, though small. The glass walled bathroom was quirky and the bathroom itself well stocked. Bed was comfortable. The only small criticisms were that there was some very obvious damp in the bathroom and the internet in the room was very expensive. Staff overall were friendly and efficient and we used the concierge service for restaurant recommendations and other information. Finally a word has to go to the fabulous rooftop pool and the magnificent spa. Prices for the treatments might seem a little off putting but are well worth it. We stayed here as part of a three month trip around the world and this was the best spa we came across.

<Content>Great rooms, great amenities and great location The Langham Place Hotel in Mongkok is a very stylish, very modern and very comfortable hotel. Its location is great; only a few minutes work to the Mongkok MTR station and only a quick 15min cab ride to central. The Langham Place is surrounded by great shops; it even has its own 13 story shopping mall across the street connected by a walkway.We booked a Club Level room online, and when we arrived we were escorted to a private check-in. Believe me, the Club rooms are well worth the extra price because they come with a huge range on complimentary services: free wired/wireless internet, free use of the gym/swimming pool, access to a private lounge on Level 36 and free breakfast.The hotel as a whole is great, as mentioned before. The dining options available are top notch, with a range of Western and Cantonese food available; the rooms are great; the roof top swimming pool and gym is first class and what is more, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful.I recommend this hotel to anyone not scared off by the high prices, mind you we did stay there over New Years, so I presume it would be a fair bit cheaper at less popular times. The Club rooms are well worth the extra price. And the stay was just great all round.

<Content>Langham Place is the Place to stay This was our final hotel and destination on our honeymoon and we were unsure of what to expect as it was booked as a gift by the brother in law... we needent have been worried, this place is wonderful and in a great location.The staff are always happy to help you, no matter when or what with they will go out of their way to advise you or find a solution to yourproblem.In the summer time this must be an excellent location as you can see all over the place if on the higher floors, we were on the 27th and that was high enough! The swimming pool is outdoors and is on the verytop of the building. Not great for height fears, but a beautiful escape from the hustle and bustle.You can't go wrong here with food either as they serve every kind, we opted to go local every night and were never dissapointed.Price wise this place is amazing, the rooms are certainly 5* plus and the location is super.

<Content>Superlative hotel with uniquely "friendly" female staff This has to be one of the finest hotels in the world, with exquisite facilities and an all-round air of style and sophistication. The location is some way off of the beaten track, but adjacent to Mongkok subway and the area - although highly colourful - never once felt dangerous or threatening.I stayed in an Executive Suite and throughout my stay was given very personal attention by one Pink Ladies who meet  greet guests in the lobby, though it has to be said that all of the concierge staff were extremely helpful.The rooftop pool is especially wonderful.

<Content>Good value for money for HK I lived in Langham Place for 4 months in 2007 and have stayed there a total of 10 or so times in the past few years.The basic rooms are small and the finish on many rooms is a little cheap for a 5 star (veneer panelling, poor grouting technique in the bathrooms, cheap knobs and buttons etc), but the rooms are generally well appointed, modern, feel clean and new and are good value for money for what you get in Hong Kong. (I lived here remember, so I experienced many, many, many rooms so maybe I am being a little fussy, but hey.... I kept coming back).I would recommend upgrading to the executive room as the bathrooms are that little bit nicer with glass walls and separate shower.The hotel pool is small but nice, and the change rooms (AKA, relaxing havens) are wonderful. I used them all the time as they felt like a day spa. They had piped relaxing music, stone finishes, candles, plunge pool, sauna, steam room, mirror backed showers, lockers, facilities for getting ready like hairdryers, cotton buds, mini towels. They even have a machine that sucks the water from your swimsuit! The staff are great and we have always had a great time here. The 'pink ladies' manning the lifts are useless, but a nice touch! lol.I always get my family and friends to consider staying here when they visit Hong Kong because the suburb of Mong Kok is a great base for tourists. At the Lanham Place, you step out of your luxe hotel into the one of the most densely populated parts of Hong Kong and are in the thick of things. It is right near the Mong Kok MTR and hundreds of buses to almost every part of Hong Kong run up and down Nathan Rd which is close by.The Langham Place Mall (shopping) is connected to the hotel and has some OK restaurants and kitsch Asian shopping experiences. Also, if you wanted to walk through this mall to the MTR and travel to many other shopping malls underground by train all across HK, you could in fact never have to go outside if it's bucketing with rain or hot. At the end of the day, the hotel bar is great and they always have jazz singers to entertain. It's a great spot to meet before heading out.All of the Qantas staff stay here too, so it's interesting to watch the pilots and stewards arriving and departing for each flight to and from Melbourne/Sydney. At least you always know when you'd better leave for the airport to catch your flight back home!

<Content>Langham Place Hotel Just returned from a 8 night Christmas stay at the Langham Place Hotel with my 16 year old daughter. We booked the hotel after reading the reviews and were not disappointed. Everything that has been written about the hotel, staff and location are spot on. The hotel deserves its 5* rating and our room on the club floor was lovely. Afternoon tea in the club is excellent and my daughter reguarly took extra warm scones up to the room. The hotel is situated in a very busy area - the real Hong Kong but it is situated next to the MTR station and it was easy to get around Hong Kong. The market tour provided by the hotel is very informative and helped us with our barganing skills when we ventured out alone.All in all a wonderful hotel and everything written about it is true. We will definitely be going back to Hong Kong next year and will stay at the Langham again.

<Content>A Return Visit that did not disappoint Following our visit in October 2005 for a stop over, we used the Langham Place as our base for an extended visit to Hong Kong. Just at the end of the Chinese New Year, the atmosphere was great. This time we stayed in a Club Room and use of the Club Lounge.A nice touch was the complimentary desert from the hotel management on the occaision of my wife's 40th birthday.The location was perfect for access to all parts of Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Terrotries - through the MTR and a Hong Kong Octopus Card.

<Content>If you're going to HK stay here! We stayed at the Langham Place for 3 nights at the end of a 2 week honeymoon in thailand and what a fantastic place. It has everything - great service, great style, great rooms and one of the best hotel swimming pools anywhere in the world. The first thing I would say is don;t be put off by the Location. The hotel is attached to the Langham Place Mall which is enormous with some 300 shops and some great restaurants. The Mong Kok MTR station is about 20m away and is only 2 stops from Tsim Tsha Sui. It also goes to Central on HK island. Mong Kok itself is bustling with real HK life. We liked it becuase it away from the Tsim Tsha Sui tourist trap where you get hasled every 10m by hawkers.We opted for the Limo service from the airport which is a great way to see some of HK. If you get talking to your driver he will give you a guided tour on the trip. On arriving at the hotel we were met by the concierge which consists of an extremely polite young lady dressed in a red suit with a red hat. These concierge seem to be a trademark of the hotel as they appear everywhere and have no other purpose than to say good morning/afternoon/night and calling lifts for you. The recpetionist was Japanese and spoke perfect english. She was very efficient and made us feel very welcome. Without even asking we were given a late check out on our last day as our flight back to the UK wasn't until late in the evening. Whilst waiting to check in the hot face towels we were provided with was a nice touch.The rooms are very smart indeed, although not the biggest. Most of the space is taken up by the very comfortable king size bed. The duvet and pillows are of the highest quality. The bathroom is also quite special. The sink unit is one big piece of moulded glass which means you can see all the stylish chrome pipe work. The whole room is filled with mirrors to make what is a small bathroom seem much larger. The partition wall between the bathroom and bedroom is glass with a pull down screen. This means you can see the TV from the bath. The shower is the best I've ever had. There are some great gadgets in the bedroom itself. The air con is touch screen, the flat screen TV has an excellent virtual concierge that explains how everything in the room works. The telephone is also very useful. Its a Cisco IP Telephony phone which basically means that you can search the internet with it. It will provide you with things like the weather, news, exchange rate etc. It also lets you book a table in the restaurants and spa treatments. You can also get tube and city maps at the touch of a button - very useful.If you get chance and are that way inclined take a visit to the gym. The views are incredible and the position of the running machines are enough to make anyone want to take up running. The swimming pool is also fantastic. Its open air but the pool is so warm. Its on the top floor (42nd) and needless to say the views are pretty impressive.All in all this is an extremely impressive hotel. The service is very slick and everything is done with a touch of style. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone visiting HK and if I back that way in the future I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>The Other Reviews Said It All! I rely almost totally on TripAdvisor reviews when booking hotels, so was expecting a marvelous experience at the Langham Place Hotel. I was not disappointed! I have been to Hong Kong 4 times, but this time I decided to take my children  their spouses (party of 6) for 5 nights. I figured Mong Kok would be more fun for them than elsewhere,  wanted a somewhat newish hotel for their introduction to one of the world's most exciting cities. The Langham Place Hotel was perfect! Check-in was easy, probably because we had e-mailed our requests ahead of time. There was a large convention of cardiologists in the hotel plus a wedding when we arrived, yet it didn't seem crowded. The rooms we had were on different floors with varied views, but all wonderful. I note that the hotel offers Sunday entertainments for children, which was quite a nice touch. There are changing signs in the lobby (on the 4th floor) that detail coming events. I particularly liked the fact that the bar had rolling BBC headlines, and that at breakfast the placemats showed newsheadlines, DJIA, and stock market closes from around the world. Breakfast was great! Dim sum, sushi, eggs made to request, hot and cold cereals, fresh honey comb, fresh fruits (even lichees!), and some of the best, flaky pastries I've ever had. Breakfast was included in our hotel room price, BTW. The Ming Court restaurant has superb food, altho the English translations of the dishes leaves a bit to be desired (I had difficulty thinking about eating fungus for example, altho I know they meant mushroom). The decor is sleek, accented with excellent quality reproductions of bronzes and ceramics found in the Mong Kok area. Prices are not inexpensive  everything is a la carte ($5 US for a Tsing Tsao beer; $10 US for a glass of wine; $10 for a salad; $30 entree), but the quality is worth it. We wanted to return to Loong Yuen, a fabulous restaurant in the basement of the Holiday Inn (yes, really!), so asked the concierge to make a reservation for us. He did, but with the caveat that we would have to be finished by 8:30 because the restaurant had been booked for a wedding. When we arrived, we were surprised to find that the chef had put together a special menu just for us, complete with a Private Reserve Shiraz wine. How nice for the Concierge to request that special treat on his own!The rooms are adequate in size - actually quite large by HK standards. There is a desk, with desk chair, TV, Smart Phone, chest of drawers, 2 bedside tables, an arm chair, small refrig, accoutrments for fixing coffee or tea, a nice-sized closet with ironing board  iron. Again, there are charges for beverages and coffee/tea. However, we received 2 bottles of complimentary water daily. The toiletries provided were fine - nothing special, but I really liked the turn-down service with slippers. We didn't have kimonos in our room, like my children did, but the terry-cloth bathrobes were nice. The spa treatments were impressive (price reduction if booked between 8-10 a.m.). For $200 US you get a 2 hour pampering: facial, mud wrap, accupressure massage. What could be better after a day running around Hong Kong  Kowloon?Check out went smoothly. There were no surprises on the bill. Our bags were picked up promptly. All in all, I'd rate this hotel highly, and would return in a heartbeat. The food and staff are stupendous!

<Content>Langham Place Hotel My partner and I stayed at the Langham Place for 9 nights in November. I have stayed in quite a few good hotels in HK, but this hotel stands head a shoulders above the rest..Everything about it is fabulous, from the time we were picked up in the hotel limosine from the airport to arrival, check in, and the room.The staff fall over themselves to make you comfortable, nothing is too much trouble. The retaurants and bars are well staffed and the food and drinks are of excellent quality.Most hotel rooms in HK are on the small size, but our executive room was well laid out and perfectly adequate.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in HK. It is close to the MTR, and the hotel is attached to a shopping mall, for a shop till you drop experience.We will certainly use the hotel again when we return.

<Content>Great with one exception (phone calls) I booked this hotel for my parents' 2-week vacation to Hong Kong. They haven't been back for 40 years so I thought that it'd be nice to stay in a 5-star hotel. They told me the stay was excellent and that the free breakfast (must book a package to receive) was spectacular - it included all sorts of culinary delights from dim sum to sushi to omelettes cooked to order, etc.The one problem was that upon checking out, they discovered that their phone calls were $25HKD each. These were calling card calls to New York City (thus, a local number). What's more, the package we booked stated specifically free local calls.  They complained but the receptionist claimed that all hotels charge if you dial using a calling card. That's absurd. They made 30 such calls which becomes a hefty sum. They really need to state explicitly that long distance calls using calling cards are charged.Other than that, everything else was great. We asked them if we could take 2 tours instead of the included 1 free tour and it was approved.

<Content>Great Use Of Space, at the Langham Place The Langham Place Hotel offered a well equiped room, which was designed incredibly well to fit a relatively small space (although the transparent wash basin in the bathroom is a little freaky!). The hotel offers a fantastic 41st floor open-air swimming pool  spa facilties that offer a luxurious feel. The hotel is well located with plentiful shopping and resturants in the immediate vicinity. The tube station is also located directly below the hotel.Our research of Hong Kong suggested that hotel rooms are generally small  our room (despite not being an entry level room) proved to be so. However, with a superking bed, full bathroom (including tub), and good storage the facilities within the room were in no way compromised and the hotel offered a comfortable 3-night stay and a breakfast buffet offering plentiful choice.

<Content>This Hotel is Certainly A Number 1! Stayed there for 5 nights. This hotel is the best I have come across in all my travels. The rooms were very comfortably but what is more important, the hotel has thought of everything that a traveller would need to feel at home and well-looked after. The room has a Cisco Smart Phone and all one needs to do to ask for service or help is just to press one button. The SMART operator functions like a one-stop service personal for everything - from laundry, to food, to setting you up for a quick checking out etc. SPA is just excellent and the gym is 24 hours. I have stayed in many hotel and I always have issues with the opening hours of the gym. They normally start at 6.30 am and there isn't enough time to get in an hour of exercise and then be heading out for a meeting at 8.30 am unless I skip breakfast. The concierge provided boxes, sticky tap and strings for packing - something a traveller who is doing some heavy shopping would need. The room was also very well thought out. There is excellent range of free beverages, the see through glass bathroom gives the room a sense of space. The room we were at was on the 27th floor and it has a panaronomic view. The whole place smells clean and good. The hotel is just next to Langham Place a shopping centre with lost of retail space and food! It sits on top of the Mongkok station and I think one can't ask for more in terms of location. Food around the area is readily available and Electronic, Sports and Ladies Market just a short walk away.

<Content>Amazing! Couldn't fault it! Stay here Having read previous reviews of this hotel on TripAdvisor I had high expectations - which I can safely say were met and exceeded! Everyone going to Hong Kong should stay here!Hotel Location: 5 mins walk to the MTR (tube) station. 5 mins walk from ladies market and sports market, 10 mins walk to goldfish market and flower market. Roughly 15mins MTR ride to Star ferry and Kowloon area.Hotel rooms: very luxury, clean, everything you could possibly need and more! We paid the extra for a Club room and it was worth it - although I am sure the other rooms in the hotel were just as nice. Rooms have massive flat screen tv, wireless access, ipod docking station (in Club rooms), rain power shower, complimentary water and chocolates/slippers by the bed at night! Floor to ceiling windows had a lovely view of the city. Room also had a free of charge safe for guest use.Club L facilities: free of charge drinks (alcohol included) all day/night plus snacks and continental breakfast. Internet access with computers, library, DVD library and personalised check in. I thought it was worth paying the extra for the free drinks and snacks, plus the internet access was handy.Hotel food: Room service was excellent value and prompt. We also paid for the full breakfast (Club breakfast was continental only) and this was an amazing selection (e.g. english,omlettes, pancakes) and very tasty. If you are happy with continental only then don't bother paying the extra for this! We went to the chinese restaurant in the hotel which was of a very high standard. We also ate in The Place which serves a buffet style menu in the evenings which was again delicious.Other hotel facilities: Hotel roof top swimming pool and jacuzzi was absolutely lovely and just what you needed after a day of sightseeing! Chaun Spa was most relaxing too - I recommend! The shopping centre next to the hotel was great and very big, so take some time to go around it all!! Its great to just walk back over the bridge to the hotel to drop your purchases off!!Other tips for HK overall: 1.Buy an Octopus card, you can use this for all bus/train/MTR travel including the Peak Tram  bus to Po Lin Monastery.2. Go on the free Mongkok markets tour the hotel offers - a lovely lady took us round and gave some great tips. One of which is to visit the sports market near the hotel - lots of trainers, both for casual and sports wear - at good prices.3. Go to Stanley market on the other side of Hong Kong island.Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here, the staff at the hotel were so kind and professional, it makes such a welcome change to have such a high standard of customer service. The staff really do predict what your needs are going to be before you even ask them!!

<Content>AWESOME Lovely hotel. Great location for shopping. Adjacent to train station so you can get anywhere in Hong Kong easily. I booked a club room and on arrival was upgraded to a Suite which was pure bliss. Arrived early in the morning and my room was available immediately! Can't recommend this hotel highly enough. I will be staying there whenever I am lucky enough to get to Hong Kong. Its an amazing hotel in an amazing city.

<Content>As Good As Ever! Just finished 2 stays at Langham Place and I'm glad to see that nothing has changed since my last visit in June. The service and facilities were excellent, again, and even though Mongkok seems more crowded (if that's possible), I love the location of this hotel. I stayed in a Residential Suite on my first stay and then in a Langham Suite on my second stay and I much preferred the Residential Suite. The living room of the RS feels much more spacious with the kitchenette instead of the bathroom of the LS. Although the bedroom and the bathroom of the RS are the same size as that of the LS, there is also more foyer space between the two in the RS. The service and attitude of the staff at this hotel are just amazing. As an example, my room attendant went throughout the hotel looking for a remote that would activate the Nicam feature on my TVs and was only successful on her third try but I really appreciated the effort she extended on my behalf. The personnel in the Club Lounge were efficient and helpful and you will just have to experience it to see what I mean. Wonderful hotel.

<Content>Great location to experience the real Hong Kong Stayed for one night at the end of November 2007. Excellent service levels and quality of room - I would definitely recommend this for a longer stay.The plus point for me was the location, right in Mongkok. This gives you a chance to experience the real Hong Kong, well the Kowloon side at least, but in relative luxury.Although I was travelling on business I thought that the price was reasonable enough for a personal stay too. Remember that you also get access to the gym and swimming pool.If you're a first timer in Hong Kong, I'd recommend getting a taxi from the airport. At around HK$280 it will save having to find the hotel from Airport Express station.

<Content>Loved it Lovely place, the reviews are right. We stayed in a suite, they were doing a special suite deal on there website so we booked thru that. That gives you free internet access and free use of the pool and the club L lounge which is great. Free drinks and food 24 hours a day, not just generic drinks, the real branded macoy! So bombay saphire gin, champagne (not sparkling wine) everything was first class. Booked the limo transfer to the airport which is defo worth the extra little amount over a taxi, sitting in the back of an S class mercedes was opulance! Very close to the mtr subway, which is an absolute credit to the city, clean safe and cheap, buy an octopuss card to travel easily on the mtr, you just scan it over the reader and the fare is automatically deducted. Its No.1 on trip advisor for a reason, its brilliant!We had a late flight when we checked out (12pm) They let us check out late (3pm) and use full facitilties of the club lounge untill we departed in the limo. Lovely!

<Content>Simply the Best Booked a Club room for 4 nights. Booked a hotel car from the airport, a perfect way to arrive. Upon arrival were taken to Club Floor and were upgraded to a Club Suite. The suite was terrific and the Club Lounge amazing with food and drinks seemingly available all day.The staff are superb, nothing too much trouble. It was our first visit to Hong Kong and I must say we could not have had a better hotel. Truly memorable.I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The MTR (underground) is a minute away giving easy access to the whole area,and you are in the middle of bustling Mongkok with its markets and great shops.The International restaurant really is, serving food from all corners of the world.If/when we return to Hong Kong this will be the place for us.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! Have just got back from 10 brilliant days in Hong Kong, staying in the Langham Place. Like many, we were swayed by the reviews to book a club level room and didn't regret it for a minute. Fab views, wonderful service - just take a wrap or jumper if you're susceptible to air conditioning!Couldn't fault the hotel at all, particularly the wonderful staff who really made our stay, and easy access to the MTR from which we travelled all over Hong Kong - 7 minutes to Tsim Sha Tsui and 11 to Admiralty on the Island - brilliant!We would count ourselves as cautious travellers but loved the Mongkok location - felt like one of the locals! We had booked trips to Lantau and into China and were picked up at the hotel, no problem. Also visited Disneyland which was good fun too and just 30 mins on the MTR. Just counting the days now until we have saved up enough to go back!

<Content>Langham Place - best place outside of Central Langham Place is a great hotel in Mongkok. If you're heading to Hong Kong for work or pleasure this is a fantastic place to stay, without paying the high prices you'll find in Central - and only a few train stops away. Langham Place is connected to Langham Mall....a very trendy mega-mall, almost a bit too trendy for my tasts, but interesting to see what the latest fads are. It's also a few blocks away from Ladies Market, Electronics Market, and Sports Market for some interesting night bargain shopping. The hotel iteself is fabulous - the bathroom shares a glass wall with the hotel room, very cool. My favorite part is the negative edge rooftop pool and high-end exercise room. The morning breaksfast is also fabulous, a great selection of fruits, breads, and hot foods.

<Content>Just what the Dr ordered Stayed at the Langham Place for 9 nights from 8th November. I had booked the hotel following such wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. The trip was a suprise for my husband's 40th and it certainly was a trip to remember. I had booked a club level room with access to the club lounge. When we checked in - not in the lobby but in the club lounge with a cup of tea and a hot towel - they asked us if we'd like to upgrade to a suite. I was quite happy with the room I had originally booked so declined. However, they gave us the suite anyway. So, just keep this in mind. What can I say about the hotel which has not already been reported. The staff are wonderful. Concierge can tell you anything you need to know and give you the easy way to get around. They were just wonderful. We purchased an Octopus card which is the greatest creation going and travelled everywhere by MTR; Star Ferry and Bus. The transport system is one of the best I have ever come across. The location of the hotel is, in my opinion, perfect. The markets are all on your doorstep, I felt safe everytime I went out on my own to do a spot of shopping whilst my husband and son had a swim early evening. We had breakfast in The Place each morning as the variety is so vast compared to the Club lounge which is just continental. But the lounge itself is well worth the extra if you are considering. Afternoon tea from around 3pm- 5.30; Canapes from 6pm - 8pm and dessert from 8pm - 10pm. A good variety of wine; spirits; soft drinks and champagne. As first time visitors to HK, we never tired of sitting in the window with a drink in hand looking out over the skyline towards HK island and watching the light show around 8pm. The two massage chairs in the lounge are wonderful, and have loads of settings including one just for your feet and legs which was much needed after a long flight. Ellie in the Club lounge was excellent - she would arrange anything for you and could not do enough to help which must be said of all the staff. I could go on and on about how wonderful the Langham Place is - however,it would take you days to read! If you need to know anything in particular, please feel free to ask. For a treat of pure luxury in the busy lives we all lead, the Langham is just what the Doctor ordred! Enjoy!

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed at Langham Place for 3 nights over a weekend and were pleased we chose this hotel.All the staff were very friendly and were happy to assist in any way they could.The room was modern and clean with a fantastic powerfull shower, however we found the room to be on the small side as we expected a larger one for the 鈧?10 p/n incl breakfast we paid.We dined in Ming Court on our first night and had a great meal, we were surprised at how reasonable the food cost when I recieved the bill.The Shopping Mall next door has a good selection of shops, cafes and restaurants and you can go there from the hotel via an enclosed walkway.We found the best shopping to be in Causeway Bay. If you dont want to use the subway station at the hotel a Taxi from hotel will cost HK$80 incl tip one way.We did not use the hotel spa or pool but they looked great when I went to have a look around.The Bar was busy and had some good live music and there was happy hour each evening between 18:30  20:30 where drinks were 2 for 1.Free Internet with 6 Laptops was available at a location near the bar and a large Flatscreen TV to keep you up to speed on World News and Sport.The only problem we had during our stay was coming back to our room in late afternoon to find the room had not been cleaned.Each morning we left the room at 09:30 and pressed a button to request room to be cleaned so it was dissapointing to find room not cleaned on our return.I mentioned this a checkout and even filled out a form so I hope this problem will be sorted out.We had a great time at Langham Place and would stay here again when I next visit Hong Kong.

<Content>Mixed Experience Got back on Sunday and am missing their beds! The hotel is excellent at what it does and I am glad to say that overall it deserves a high ranking on TA - the basis on which I went with this hotel.Check in was a breeze, although I must add that we arrived at like 4.30am so I wouldn't really expect anything else!The rooms, we first stayed in the Deluxe rooms for 5 nights before upgrading to a couple of suites for the last two nights, were very smart and done to high quality standard. Not sure the suite's are worth the hike in the price as they dont differ enough from the usual rooms i.e. you get more floor space and a kitchen area but the furniture is pretty much the same deal and the standard rooms do it so well anyway. I suppose with a longer stay, we could have appreciated it more. One thing I will stress though, is that the beds are awesome! I am not usually so taken with hotel beds, normally they are good and you can get a good nights rest. But these were off the scale. The down pillows and duvets were just right on the mark for me to the point where I ended up asking where I could get them from!Facilities wise, the gym was nicely equipped, changing rooms incorporating a sauna, steam room and hot tub were great. As was the outdoor swimming pool on the 42nd floor.Restaurants were pretty much what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre and nothing more or less.The Club Lounge was excellent. It was organised and maintained throughout the day and during the night. The massage chairs are excellent for helping to relax after a hard day of sightseeing/shopping/conferences! The only real downside for me were some of the staff. They were not rude or impolite or anything of that nature but it seems that quite a few of them struggled with understanding my requests. If I asked for an extra coffee cup, the first response was for them to send up more coffee and sugar. Asked the concierge to help book a restaurant at Disneyland hotel, he gave me a brochure...I thought it might have been down to me but the fact is, the staff in the Lounge were absolutely excellent and I had no problems with them on similar types of requests. Not a great concern as I would be far more worred if they had attitude problems but they didnt.Location-wise, I found the hotel to be excellent. Right in the middle of a number of attractions, it was extremely well served by the MTR (on its doorstep) , its own shopping plaza and nearby parks. The only thing that put me off about the experience was the smells of Mong Kok. Its an 'interesting' mix of sewage, cooking, incense and other smells that can leave you gagging for oxygen.Luckily, this is not the case within the hotel complex but be prepared for it almost as soon as you hit the streets!That aside though, I absolutely loved the place, the hotel was fantastic overall and worth the price.If I am ever back in HK, I will be looking up Langham Place again.

<Content>Great choice in Hong Kong My wife, son and I stayed at LP for three nights 9-12 November 2007 and we would hghly recommend it. After alot of research, we got the best rate through their website which included breakfast and a return limo transfer from the airport. The latter was fantastic after our long flight from LHR - even given a PSP with a video all about the hotel and HK on it. Room not the biggest (this is Hong kong) but clean with the all glass bathroom and a good view. Standard buffet breakfast - tried the evening buffet in 'The Place' one night. Good spread but quite expensive. Much better options available on several floors in the attached shopping centre. Free internet access available at computers in the work and play section. Great views from the pool, but it was a bit small and often crowded with no loungers available. We were travelling with a one year old - staff very child friendly (sometimes overpoweringly so!). Location was very good - nice walk down to Star Ferry terminal and Temple Street night market or you could easily use the MTR. Taxis actually good value as well but make sure you take the hotel-provided translation card.... not many drivers speak English! Would definitely stay here again for its relative good value, excellent location and friendly staff.

<Content>Truly 5 star This was our second stay at the Langham Place, This is truly a 5 Star Hotel.We stayed in a triple club room and for the extra you pay , it is excellent value, complimentary breakfasts, complimentary teas in the afternoon ,complimentary cocktails and canapes in the evening, full use of the rooftop pool and leisure facilities, free use of the computers in the club lounge and so the list goes on.Ideally placed in the Mongkok district for the hustle and bustle of the shops and street markets and just across the road to the MTR station.Marvellous would really recommend this hotel.M.

<Content>It's all true - Really! My ten year old daughter and I stayed at the Langham Place Hotel in Mong Kok for one night last weekend as a finale to our trip to Hong Kong. My little girl was apparently experiencing cultural overload, homesickness and travel exhaustion but the quiet luxury and friendliness of the staff soon put her at her ease. We loved the view of the harbour (including the sound and light show) from our window seat on the 30th floor. The cosiness and creature comforts of our room made it a haven from the city below. The roof-top pool was beautiful and has superb views both day and night. The spa staff were charming. We upgraded to the executive club which gave us access to nibbles and drinks when we wanted them.We really enjoyed the amazing international buffet in The Place restaurant - Indian, European, Japanese including sushi hand-made in front of you, local specialities and seafood - lots and lots of seafood - although the array of desserts was spectacular too - tiny cakes, pannacotta, creme brulee, warm English-style bread and butter pudding with vanilla cream and chocolate fountains for dipping fruit, marshmallows and waffles.The breakfast buffet was generous and catered to all tastes.The Langham Place shopping centre and Mon Kok MTR station are adjacent to the hotel and were both very busy on Saturday afternoon. There were plenty of dining choices in the mall.We used the hotel's limousine service to get us to our early homeward flight on Sunday morning. Everything went smoothly and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. I cannot wait to go back. Thankyou to all the staff at Langham Place, especially Fion the hostess at The Place.

<Content>A fantastic experience My husband and I spent a week at the Langham Place and loved it. From booking through to departure, the staff were professional, pleasant and eager to please. The standards of housekeeping are exceptionally high. Our room was spotless and beautifully made up every day. We had an executive room, although we were offered the deluxe on arrival as our room was not quite ready. We decided not to take the deluxe as we wanted the extras that the executive had to offer. We were not disappointed. The oversized bath was very welcome after the long flight; the separate shower was spacious and the rain shower feature was lovely after a hot and humid day out and about in Hong Kong. The bed was so comfortable and roomy. Try the different scented pillows! The spa and pool facilities are excellent and, again, incredibly clean. We got the feeling that the staff enjoy their jobs and take great pride in what they do. Nothing was too much trouble without being intrusive. Try the hotel's evening buffet which offers you the most incredible selection of dishes. Hong Kong is amazing; transport system is cheap and efficient. We can't wait to go back!

<Content>Exceptional Hotel My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in October. We booked a club room and based on what we read on tripadvisor, we had high expectations of this hotel. We were not let down...This hotel offers excellent service together with very high standards of comfort and amenities. The pool on the 42nd floor is amazing with unbelievable views over Hong Kong and Kowloon. It is situated in Mong Kok, a really busy place with markets, shops and an unbelievable amount of people. The hotel acted as a safe haven around the madness outside the doors. The room was on the 35ft floor with exceptional views. It was a large double with a fabulous shower and a very comfortable bed. As it was a club room, we availed of the bar offering drink and food all day. It is a real treat when you have been walking the streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon all day and it is definately worth the extra money when booking. The service is very personal and the staff will stand on their heads to help you. The GYM looked very well equipped but I never managed to go. The exercise you get walking the streets should be enough if you plan to take in all the sights.Food in the Hotel was OK. We ate there three times and twice had the buffet. The standard menu in the main restaurant is only OK but the buffet has all types of food catering from every pallet. If you are staying in Hong Kong, this is definately worth a look. You should not be disappointed...

<Content>Great Hotel Located in Mong Kok as soon as you step outside the Langham Place you are in the middle of the real HK - and also the most densely populated area. It's an unusual location for a 5*, but it's a weel serviced hotel with very high standards - and I mean high! If you don' tlike heights don't go here - there lifts are scenic (although a couple are enclosed) and the swimming pool on the 42nd floor treadmills face the view from the 41st.It's a good half hour walk from the harbour front, and in a busy place like this that's not easy. however MRT is just outside the Langham Place mall (connected to the hotel), and is so efficient you are anywhere in a few minutes. So all the sights are within easy reach. Concierge are very obliging, and despite other comments on the site there is no need to bribe them with big tips. Hotel breakfast is excellent (but shouldbe at the price) and the Ming Court chinese is very good indeed.Wonderful beds and pillows, and glass wall in the bathroom mean you can watch the plasma TV from the bath, and watch you other half have a --- while you lie on the bed! well, there is a blind you can pull.....Don't miss out on MongKok though, it's a fascinating area of HK that you might not visit unless staying at this hotel.

<Content>A great Hotel Wow, what a surprise! This hotel is paired up with a shopping mall that is 13 stories vertical. This hotel is not near any other high end hotels and is away from the waterfront, but that makes it unique. The entrance is thru the shopping mall, but that gives you tons of places to eat and shop right outside your hotel door. It is one block from Nathan Road, a major shopping street and two blocks from some great cheap shopping streets. Ladies Market, sporting goods street, and electronics street are nearby. Be sure to haggle. The metro (Mong Kok Station) could be accessed from the mall and you can walk down to the tip of Kowloon in about a half hour. Of course, that means you dont shop all the way down. It seemed a brand new hotel with superior service - and we just came from Japan.....where service is superb.

<Content>Experience fantastic service  Our first stop before a tour of China was 4 nights at the Langham Place in Mongkok. We were lucky to receive a very affordable deal on the website for a Residential Suite on the 38th floor, and were thrilled with the luxury that awaited us. Super soft king size bed, plenty of space with the extra lounge area, and the bathroom was fabulous. Even the small touches like welcoming fruit, sweets and chocolate mouse was a pleasant surprise. Even the check-in process in the Club Lounge was very quick and friendly with a welcome cup of cha...was appreciated after a long day travelling, too.The buffet breakfasts in The Place restaurant was fabulous, with plenty of variety to choose from all served by attentative staff. Complimentary drinks and snacks, friendly chatter with the staff and incredible service in a quiet atmosphere in The Club Lounge was well received after a gruelling day of either site-seeing and shopping. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its service, its attention to detail and also we found that the location was perfect for the more serious shopping and sites around the Mongkok area. Right next to the MTR too, for convenience.

<Content>Fantastic, Can't wait to go back The hotel was marvellous. Would definately recommend upgrading to the club lounge, we had 8 women travelling and it was a great place to stay. The Club Lounge had nibbles and drinks all afternoon and was definately a nice place to relax and unwind after a huge day shopping! The pool area is great and if you like a morning run, there is nothing better than the treadmills in front of full glass windows overlooking Hong Kong. Not to mention plenty of other machines to give yourself a nice fresh start to the day.  We shopped in the local area a lot and took two trips over to Shenzhen - this was amazing. We booked a tour guide to take us the first day and that was a big help as it saved us getting lost. The tailoring there was good, but you need to be prepred with what you want. Taking your favourites to copy is recommended, if you don't know what you want you probably won't be happy with the results. Don't be afraid to look for other markets outside the obvious ladies ones, etc. The prices can be a bit more fixed, but cheaper and less haggling than the ladies markets. The Temple Street Night markets are also really good. Hong Kong is fantastic if you are shopping for little kids especially.

<Content>Fabulous Langham Place My husband and I stayed in October for two nights, on our way home to OZ from a European holiday. I had booked a suite, which was a special deal through the hotel's site.After several tiny European rooms I was hoping for some space, but was unprepared for the fantastic layout, which included a large bedroom, marble bathroom, lounge, office , dressing room, kitchen and spare loo with a washer drier!As a bonus we had 24 hour access to the club level, with panoramic views and limitless food and drink. This was a terrrific place to hang out on return from some serious bargaining in the nearby Ladies Market. With an early arrival on day one, we really appreciated access to a shower and bed to rest after a long flight; whilst our late departure on the final day was made easier as the club level was accessible till we departed late at night.  All staff were magnificent!By our second day in HK it was obvious that I was coming down with a cold. Ashley, manager of the club , kindly sent a tray to our room with tea, lemon ,honey and fruit, as she'd noticed I wasn't well. I'd certainly opt for this hotel again, despite its distance from the Harbour front. Perhaps the normal room rates would seem high for the location, but service says it all!

<Content>A cut above the norm I was a little sceptical at the rave reviews that this hotel got from Trip Advisor reviewers as they seemed too good to be true. However, having stayed there for two nights in September 2007, I would endorse the positive comments that have been written about Langham Place. The staff seemed to go out of their way to be courteous and friendly. In particular, the concierge staff in the lobby were very helpful in providing information about diferent locations in Hong Kong and how to get there. The rooms are beatifully furnished and equipped and are a cut above those of the average large hotel in this class. It is worth asking for a room with a view as some floors provide better views than others. My friends and I had booked two rooms, one of which had stunning views while the view in the other was far less spectacular. The mezannine bar is very pleasant and reasonably priced, at least during the early evening happy hour. Room service was efficient and of a good standard. There is a swimming pool (and spa) on the top floor with great views over the city. It is a really pleasant place to go in the evening or early in the morning. The hotel is also in a great location within walking distance of the top end of Nathan Street and very close to the metro station. It is linked physically to a shopping mall which mainly caters for a clientele of under 25s but has some good cheapish restaurants. The hotel is also within walking distance of the night market in Temple Street although much that is on sale is scarcely worth the effort. I had been in Hong Kong before about seven years ago and was surprised at how few bargains are to be had now. Beijing provides much better opportunities for the enthusiastic shopper! My only quibble with the hotel was that my room was not serviced until 4.00 pm which was very late. At 3.00 pm I asked at reception as well as the staff on the floor that it be done as soon as possible. I was, however, a little surprised that none of the staff seemed to think it unusual that the room was not cleaned in the morning. It slightly spoiled a good day in Hong Kong that I came back to find my room as I had left it early in the morning. Nonetheless, I would strongly recommend this hotel and will defintely stay there when I am back in Hong Kong.

<Content>Superb hotel - great price Based on Trip advisor reviews, I booked my group of 10 people in this hotel. The rooms and service were exceptional. The web site offered suites at HK $2,000 dbl. including a huge breakfast and a club room stocked with wine and food and goodies.The regular rooms at $1,570 dbl. were outstanding.Subway entrance located within the complex - 3 stops, and about 7 minutes to the waterfront, and continues to hk island central.Can't imagine that there's a better price - performer in HK !

<Content>Fantastic Value For Money Booked the Langham Place Hotel in Hong Kong as a result of Trip Advisor reviews and I was not disappointed. This is quite rightly the No. 1 rated hotel and offers terrific value for money if you book one of the package deals direct with the hotel.Everything about this hotel is top quality from the booking in until the check out. Executive room was fantastic, the breakfast buffet one of the best that I have seen and the whole hotel was beautiful. The location in Mongkok was fine with direct access to a wonderful shopping mall ,and the MRT system to the rest of Hong Kong.All in all a wonderful experience which I can highly recommend.

<Content>Fantastic Value for Money This hotel was fantastic. We stayed here for 4 nights in one of the Club rooms in September and the overall experience was great. On arrival we were immediately taken to the Club Lounge where we were offered green tea and hot towels whilst we were checked in. Once checked in the staff offered us champagne and took our luggage to the room. The food in the Club lounge was delightful, as was the on tap champagne whenever you wanted it. The hotel is located right next to a shopping mall and Metro station which makes it very easy to get into the middle of Hong Kong or to get the Star Ferry. You are also next to the Lady's market. The room was amazing too, small but with great views and luxury appliances. The staff couldn't do enough for us, and arranged a birthday cake for me during our stay.I would definitely return to this hotel and highly recommend it.

<Content>Best Bed Ever in my Life !!! Great Hotel !!! I have just returned from my first trip to Asia and I've had a great experience staying at the Langham Place. I was expecting too much from this hotel because of all Tripadvisor鈥檚 reviews. The first impression is excellent with a great front desk service that has done a nice job trying to find me a room at 8am !!! We had a terrible flight from Los Angeles to Hong Kong and my wife and I were really tired. After a few minutes all check-in was set and staff arranged a room for us at the 20th floor (2028 exactly) with partial view of the bay and the city. However, the best part was coming: the suburb and magic bed of this hotel ! I have been traveling around for some time and have stayed in very nice hotels but have never found a bed like this one. It was impossible to get out of the bed. After a nice nap we went to the spa and swimming pool on the roof and again, the service and facilities were terrific. The Jacuzzi is wonderful and we used it every day before breakfast and before go to bed after an exhaustive day walking around. Don鈥檛 miss it.Another thing good thing of this hotel is the breakfast. We have not included in our rate the breakfast and tried at the second day. It is a little expensive (around US$ 25) but if you are like me and wife and do not matter to spent a few bucks more on good food and service during vacation, that鈥檚 a very good deal. We had breakfast around 10am before go sightseeing and had only a light and cheap lunch. Great food.I really recommend this hotel and totally agree that Langham Place is the #1 choice in Hong Kong.

<Content>Good stylish value for Hong Kong A good standard for the price in Hong Kong. Staff anxious to please; on occaisions possibly over so. Beds comfy and the rooms just big enough and very stylish. It is in MongKok so a little bit away from the main centres for business and tourism but the MTR is very close by. The spa and fitness centre are great as is the roof top pool. I would stay there again.

<Content>Just like other reviewers said..great! The Langham Place hotel provided good quality accommodation and had very friendly and helpful staff. It truly was an oasis in a hot and humid Hong Kong. It was great staying in Mong Kok away from the usual tourist haunts and touts; however, equally the hotel was conveniently very close to the Mong Kok MTR station. This then gave us easy access to the rest of Hong Kong -the MTR is a great rail network. We are a family of five and had two interconnecting rooms which suited us well. The 'included' buffet breakfast was also a treat and kept us going for best part of the day. The children, especially, enjoyed the chocolate fountain - even at breakfast!

<Content>Modern, clean and very expensive Somehow we ended up paying double what we thought we had to pay for this hotel. This most likely was because an error we made which is beyond the scope of this review. We paid $370 a night for this hotel which we felt was over-priced. Furthermore, when we got there they offered to move us to a better room (they proceeded to tell us what a great room it was - view, size, etc...) but for only X amount more. I am used to getting upgraded periodically at no charge. I found it strange that they were offering (what appeared to me) to upgrade me for an extra fee. Maybe that's just Hong Kong.Rooms were clean and modern but quite small. Location in Mong Kong is not so great either. Overall, I would recommend staying in this hotel only if you can get a decent rate.

<Content>Wish we could have stayed longer We had a great stay and would certainly recommend staying here on a trip to HK. The rooms are small, that鈥檚 HK for you 鈥?but the location is awesome you really feel like you are in the thick of things (visit the food market at the back of the hotel to see how locals shop for dinner, it鈥檚 an eye opener).The staff are very friendly and can鈥檛 do enough for you. Likewise the roof top pool and gym are fabulous. You really can鈥檛 fault the place and we鈥檇 certainly stay here again.

<Content>Just Fantastic FantasticBook a club room as the lounge is great value for money with free booze till 1amRoom was lovelyStaff were very friendlyVery handy location with good access to the MRT underground system via the amazing Mall next to the hotel. Hong Kong is very anti smoking and finding a bar to have a cigarette was a challange. Eventually found one on the 13th floor of the Mall next door.Dont change money at the hotel, their rates are poor. Use a money change booth on the street.Soy Street has a good selection of restaurants to eat in

<Content>Just perfect! We stayed in the Langham Place Hotel for a week at the end of August/early September. The place is a 5 star hotel and it deserves every star! The view is magnificient. The rooms are very comfortable, you can even choose your own type of pillow (green tea leaves, rose, etc!). The bathroom has a shower and a tub, white marble, thick white towels, bathrobes etc. Huge flat screen, DVD player, etc. The nicest thing was, on August 30th, we heard a knock on the door at 2pm, when coming back from lunch: a guy with a silver plate with a birthday cake and a card. A little thing that I really appreciated:) The swimming pool is also very nice, on top of the building, with a superb view. The design in the entire hotel is really great. The staff very helpful and friendly. The concierge will write down anywhere you want to go so that you can give the taxi driver. There is also a spa. I had a massage there (and am used to them), and it was very professionally mafe. So, two thumbs up, definitely!

<Content>Loved the staff and great location if you want to step away from the tourists I had a great stay at the Langham Place in Mog Kuk for three nights. I wanted to step away from the touristy side of Hong Kong and see a lively, local area but stay in a nice hotel. If that is what you are looking for than this hotel is THE place to be, especially with its access to the mall, great restaurants and just steps from the subway. The hotel is modern and upscale, and the staff is friendly and helpful.The hotel handled my early check-in and late departure easily. The folks in the lobby were always nice and chatty and the concierge answered all of my questions flawlessly and quickly. I was by myself, and a bit lonely because of it, but one staff woman really made me feel at home and who i nearly wanted to hug by the end of my stay! There is also a really fabulous in-room data service that gives you wonderful access to weather and other information.I really enjoyed the dim sum at Ming Court and there was a lovely lounge singer, generous drinks, and good food at the Portal. I didn't have time to check out too many facilities but the pool, gym and spa facilities were wonderful from what I can tell.The hotel offered a short tour of a few of the local markets which I enjoyed and which led to explore more of them! Here you are very near to a number of great markets for trinkets and to see the local culture! The mall attached to the hotel was decent, and the hotel is very convenient because you are just a few steps from the subway which is so efficient in Hong Kong .

<Content>Convenient for subway, clean, friendly staffs The hotel is above the Mong Kok subway station. It is very convenient to go everywhere in HK. Beside the hotel, there is a shopping mall. We can find various food there. Rooms are so clean and fashionable. They spray a kind of essence in the lobby.It smells great and makes me feel confortable and relaxing.I have been there twice. Next time if I go to HK, I would choose Langham to stay again.

<Content>My favorite in Hong Kong I've stayed here over 20 times and every time I love it even more! The rooms are fantastic, especially the corner rooms and the blissful bed is the best! The portal work and play lounge on the 2nd floor is a great place to have a drink after work and the rooftop pool and hot tub are some of the best in Hong Kong! The gym and spa are also first rate. My absolute favorite part of this hotel, however, is the dinner buffet. I've never eaten more oysters in my life...simply delicious! The service is always good from the moment you arrive to the moment you check out and I actually like the location better than TST or HK Island as it give you a chance to get out and experience the real Hong Kong. Also its easy to get from the hotel to anywhere in the territory via the MRT or KCR...the only negative is that there is no shuttle bus from the Airport Express Kowloon station to the Langham Place. There is no place I'd rather stay in Hong Kong!

<Content>Did exactly what it said on the tin As you may have already gathered from the multitude of glowing write ups on this hotel it is absolutely tremendous. The whole experience from initial booking to final check out was excellent. As many people have already said we found the best rate on the hotels own web site, there was also the opportunity to book breakfasts at a significant discount, paying as you dine can be pricey. There is also the opportunity to Skype the hotel through their web site to sort out and queries/problems you may have. Just prior to arrival we received a welcome email informing us of what offers were available, which was nice touch. Our family room was fantastic on the 32nd floor. Great views of Hong Kong and the bed was indeed blissful. The room was excellently equipped and the mini bar had a good variety of drinks at a reasonable price. The pool area is superbly located on the roof of the hotel with excellent panoramic views of Hong Kong. The Chuen Spa provides virtually every type of massage and treatment available and is well worth a visit. Many people have commented on the surrounding area of the hotel being a bit dodgy, but I think that it what makes the Langham even more special. Busy street markets just round the corner, the Langham Place mall accessible via a covered walkway, much cheaper breakfast alternatives exist in here as well, and the MTR are only 5 mins from your room. My family and I never felt threatened once whilst in Hong Kong. Perhaps the Langham鈥檚 biggest plus point are it鈥檚 superb staff. Everyone of them has obviously been well trained, as from the door staff to the management I came into contact with, they were polite, helpful and extremely proud to be of service. The breakfast buffet selection was excellent with all the food of a high standard. Complementary internet is available on the 6th and via the TV in your room for a daily tariff. I would strongly recommend that anyone visiting Hong Kong try the Langham Place Hotel as it is fantastic.

<Content>An outstanding hotel with great amenities and comfort! I stayed at The Langham Place in Hong Kong with my family for 12 nights (20/8-1/9/07). We had one Residence Suite and two standard rooms.Our stay was just wonderful. The rooms were beautifully fitted with everything one needs. It鈥檚 a fairly new hotel with high tech features and flat wall TV鈥檚 (the room phone had a screen which allows you to access news, weather, information..etc). The beds and pillows were superbly comfortable. The breakfast buffet was grand with an amazing variety of foods. In the suite, we had access to the Club Lounge, which is open 24 hrs and offered a relaxing atmosphere where you can enjoy free internet, coffee and drinks anytime (plus snacks in the afternoon and evenings). The Club Lounge is only open to suites and club room guests. However, free internet is also provided at the bar level (above the lobby) to all guests. The hotel also has magnificent spa facilities (called the Chuan Spa) 鈥?something not to be missed. The treatments were costly but indeed splendid and worth it. The hotel also has a top floor covered pool with breathtaking city views, saunas and exercise gym. The location was ideal. The hotel is directly connected to a shopping mall with lots of places to eat and to the Mong Kong MTR underground station.It's one of those hotels which you would really be hard pressed to find something wrong with it.The staff we met throughout our stay were very friendly and helpful, except for one little blemish that occurred at our check out from the suite. At 2PM, I was sitting at the Club Lounge desk waiting to check out while a male employee was finishing up some paperwork. As soon as he finished, I expected him to attend to me because I had been the only person sitting right in front of him, across his desk, for some time. But instead, he noticed a Chinese looking man, holding a US passport, entering the Club Lounge. He immediately got up and went around the desk to greet him, asking him if he was checking in or out. He then proceeded to help him, while totally ignoring me. Favoritism, racism, something else鈥?I don鈥檛 know! But whatever it was鈥? it was a blatantly rude behavior. Anyway, another female employee, who happened to be in the Lounge speaking to another guest came later to the desk and helped me check out. Despite this last minute disappointing flop, I still highly rate this hotel and give it the full five stars which it rightfully deserves.

<Content>A real oasis! Stayed at the Langham Place for 2 nights on our way back to UK from Auckland. Booked adjoining Executive Rooms as we had 3 children in tow - this was arranged very easily by e-mail with the hotel. Absolutely fabulous experience from start to finish. Arrived very early in the morning in Air New Zealand flight. Pre-booked the hotel MPV to pick us up, where they had ice cold drinks waiting for us, and from there the service just got better and better. Fabulous ladies in pink looked after the kids as we checked in, and then we killed some time in the roof-top pool whilst my wife went to the Chuan Spa and had, by her reckoning, the best spa EVER.Rooms were great, and the location was perfect for us. Slightly off the beaten track but easy access to transport, very close to Golsfish Market, Flower Market, Bird Market, and the attached mall has some cheap and cheerful places to eat.The buffet breakfast was staggering!! Something for everyone there.A great hotel which we will return to again if ever we get the chance.

<Content>Loved the Langham Place! We stayed at the Langham Place Hotel in Mongkok for 5 nights recently and loved it! The hotel is very classy, modern and every bit a five star property. We stayed on the 19th floor and had great city views. Our room was really nice, comfortable and clean. The hotel is quite new and has great facilities such as restaurants, business centre with free broadband internet, rooftop pool, the exquisite Chuan Spa, bars etc The staff went out of their way for us and made us feel very welcome, their service was exceptional. They were always cheerful and friendly.The hotel is linked to the Langham Place mall, so everything you could possibly need is within a five minute walk. The MTR (the cleanest and most efficient subway) is right under the mall so going places is easy and cheap. Mongkok itself is very cultural and busy. Expect to see lots of stalls, interesting food, and high density housing complexes with washing hanging out the windows. Even though it is very busy and there are people everywhere, no-one seems to push or shove. Its just go with the flow!This is possibly the nicest hotel we鈥檝e ever stayed at. I鈥檇 definitely stay there again, and would recommend it to anyone wanting an up-market hotel in a great location. Thumbs up!

<Content>Great hotel What a great hotel apart from the check in desk where the staff all seemed new and didn't really know how the systems worked. Stayed in a Kowloon room which was excellent, ultra modern, superbly clean with views over the city. The bar was great for a pre dinner drinks. The buffet dinner looked superb although we didn't get a chance to sample it. The service at the hotel was outstanding with all the staff very efficient and friendly. The hotel is in Mongkok and is a short metro ride to Hong Kong. Would definitely recommend this hotel

<Content>Good choice! We stayed at the Langham Place for a week this July. We had a deluxe room, which felt a little smaller than usual. Breakfast wasn't included in our rate but the hotel is right next to a shopping centre so we always had breakfast there. There are also lots of other restaurants close by. The hotel is also really close to Mong Kok MTR station. The Ladies Night Market is just around the corner as well.

<Content>No way it is no 1 in Hong Kong We stayed in the hotel on Thursday night in a standard deluxe room before heading out to Macau the next day and back again for a night stay in an executive room (much bigger). Location is good, lots of shops and just a short walk to the MTR. It is easy to get to the hotel from the airport by taking the A21 express bus which cost us HK$33 per person. The standard deluxe room is small and definitely look nicer on the website. Service is efficient but the front desk staff not very smooth in handling the check-in. Try too hard to sell the executive room but we relented the second night by paying HK$200 extra.For travellers who do not like crowds, then this hotel is not for him or her as the place are pretty crowded with lots of people at the street level.Why I've said that this hotel cannot be No 1 is that it does not broadcast English Premier League (a must nowadays for sports fans). Overall think the hotel is alright but will choose to stay at Hong Kong island hopefully to avoid the crowds.

<Content>Great location This 5 star hotel is in the middle of all the shopping action. It's a 5 minute walk to the local markets and you're next door to the very classy Langham Place Shopping Plaza. Royal Plaza, another great shopping complex, is a 10 minute walk away. You'll pass Fa Yuen St if you head in that direction, that too is a great place to shop for bargains. The hotel is also next door to a MTR. It is in a busy area of Mongkok but if you plan to shop then this is a great place to stay. There are also lots of places to eat near by, especially in the Langham Place Shopping Plaza. The Langham Place Hotel has a great buffet breakfast, worth the extra payment and the views from our 25th floor were fabulous. We paid a little extra for an executive room, got a good deal from their website. The room was small, but who needs a big room when you are out most of the time? The marble bathroom was excellent with a deep bath. The bed too was comfortable with many pillows to choose from. We had internet access and a reliable room safe. The staff were great too and English is spoken well. I don't have anything negative to say, we had a great 4 night stay.

<Content>overrated!!!! While i think this place probably deserves to be in the top twenty of Hong Kong, I don't quite get the number one ranking here- its exaggerated! I booked the Langham Place in HK precisely because of the reviews it got here at tripadvisor (sucker! :P) but if i were to return, i would feel indifferent about returning to this hotel.Things i liked that probably makes its ranking on the high side:* Good concierge service for restaurant reservations. The guy was not able to get us a table at the restaurant we wanted on the exact day we wanted, but we truly did appreciate his effort on getting back to us with an alternate date and time. Then he even left messages for us to remind us of this reservation. Nice.* Room service was also good. Very courteous and prompt and they get the details right. Yummy burger and fries, i might add.* Basically they got the smart phone thing right. Everytime you picked up the phone for a question, to order food, or for any requests, they were very polite in answering, helpful with any questions, and they would act on request or order immediately. The people were well trained in this area.* Although the size of the bathroom is small-ish, the bathroom experience was very pleasant with a separate tub and shower and there were two shower options, the rain like one thats above the head, and the hand held one. Toiletries smell yummy.* Conveniently located near an MTR station, no need to go outdoors. This was really good since it was raining while we were there. (But since I dont have business in the Mongkok area, am not sure I'd stay here again). Still better to stay at Tsim Sha Tsui area, Central, Causeway or even Wanchai, so you're in between Central and Causeway Bay.* the iHome was a nice touch :)Now about the not so desirable things:-the Langham Patrolman. This guy in the lobby who makes it his job to see if anybody in the lobby is misbehaving. Im serious, I think this is really his job. I had to wait in the lobby since room wasnt ready, so i go to the mall and get myself a coffee and look around. I returned to hotel and it was still too early, so I just sit there in one of the chairs which has a table beside it. I put my coffee on the table and start searching for something in my bag. Then.... Mr Langham Police comes and says, Sorry, but you arent allowed to put down your coffee at the table. that was really bizarre... I thought that was what tables were for!!! So i ask why? And he says with a really apologetic face, I really dont know but those are the rules. Sheeesh, if that was his job and he had to do it everyday, he might as well know why, right?? Ok that was not an isolated case. On a separate occasion, sitting in the lobby again, this guy was reprimanded for sitting on the arm part of the chair, since there werent enough chairs. And on another occasion, there was this lady beside me who was sort of filling her nails. Now this is really weird, filing your nails in public. But apparently, she broke her nail, so it was sort of necessary at that time. And of course Langham Patrol guy comes and tells her that filing is not allowed. And she says, but i broke my nail, and he says, can i see?? So bizarre. This lobby police thing is really a first for me, and its really weird. They make you uncomfortableon your own holiday.-I have to agree with the other guy that the check-in service is not quite good. First off you are welcomed at street level by these girls in hot pink outfit, and pink hats. I am not sure if I could blame my mood upon arrival, but it was just a tad annoying that they tried to make chit chat which i found a little bit contrived, like it was all a part of a script or something. GOing back to check-in, we arrived almost noon time, so this could be the reason that the queue felt like a bank queue, seriously. I mean standing in line isnt exactly jolly when you've had just come from a flight. There were probably three lanes and in each lane there were about three persons in line. Then when it was my turn to check in, the lady in the unapollogetically told me that we had to wait until two pm to get the room. It wasnt her fault really that check in time is really at 2, but it didnt help either that she had a look that felt like she just wanted to get me over with and get to the next person in line.-Room size: tiny. The size is similar to European style hotel rooms. For Hong Kong standard this is really small. No need for a huge plasma tv really, as the bed is close to the wall in front. Room had 2 single beds. There's really no option to get 2 double beds in room since they dont have any.All in all, market place-like check-in experience plus Langham police guy really ruined it for me. I am not sure this is a five star hotel. Probably a four star yes. If you feel the need to stay in Mongkok or have business there, then this is probably the best option there is. Otherwise, there are so many other options in HK. By the way, another reviewer mentioned he paid USD95 per room per night. At this price, i think its worth it. In the end, i think the level of enjoyment comes relative to price paid, so since i paid more here, and couldve paid less at similar level, better situated hotels, my satisfaction level is only at 80% level.

<Content>Very good but not flawless Stayed at the langham place in the beginning of august '07. First time in hong kong so I have great memories and I am happy with my choice of staying in the kowloon area. There is plenty to do in kowloon, nice restaurants, young fashion people, nice street markets, good views of hong kong. Upon leaving, I thought this would surely be the best hotel I would stay in china in comparison for instance with the peninsula beijing. Now I have mixed feelings.The property is excellent and the whole complex with the shopping center is fantastic - so much stuff going on at the same time. Like one of the previous reviewers, my check-in experience was not one of the best. They seemed to be quite lost with the reservations (lets just hope it was just in the beginning of august and not always). I had made the reservation months in advance and also confirmed by email 2 weeks before going there and they sent me an email confirmation for the selected dates. I was quite surprised when they called me on the 2nd day telling me I had to leave because it was check-out time already or I would have to pay extra (ps- i booked 4 nights). Also on the 2nd day, because of this mix up, we came back to find the room not serviced after leaving the room for a full day. Not 5 star service. Breakfast was quite nice but I wouldnt mind if they had a bit more selection. The rooms were small but had everything you would expect and a few nice tech gadgets. The temperature in room and blissful bedTM were quite nice and so was the bathroom.I am a nice guy so I would give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and might stay there again but I would not say it was a flawless experience. There are a lot of lobby atendants dressed in pink to direct you inside the hotel which is good because the hotels is quite busy. The concierge was helpful and fluent in english. The whole hotel design is quite nice and classy.

<Content>A room with a view to die for.....! My husband, son and myself arrived expecting the very best-we were not disappointed. This hotel was chosen carefully for the reviews, situation, room views of Hong Kong island and proximity to shops and cultural visits. The rooms-even whilst having a bath, you can look right at over the Hong Kong skyline! I cannot describe how hypnoptic and compelling this view was-day and night-we left the curtains open all the time! I have never slept in a more comfortable bed and the room was well equipped and serviced. We ate breakfast-huge and varied array for all tastes, cultures-worth being adventurous! The hotel is perfectly situated-shopping mall attached, transport networks 2/3 minutes away, local 7/11 stores for wines (expensive in comparison to GB, beers etc-hotel prices high as you would expect). There are loads of places to eat nearby. Even in the Mall there is good local cuisine and very cheap.The hotel staff were all very polite, helpful-we asked for a change of room as our son had got an even better view-no problems-done next day. The elevator girls are delightful in their pink costumes. The roof top pool-views-what can I say! The spa is so clean, relaxing and fully equipped-all needs pampered. Imagine a Gym overlooking Hong Kong-42nd floor-treadmills are never this exciting in GB!We had no delays check-in or out. All very efficient-excellent. We all agreed that this was an amazing hotel and it made the holiday. We are not always so impressed-would go back tomorrow-alas another year of saving up to go on holiday!! ENJOY-we did! FIBILL

<Content>Missed it!!! Stayed at the Langham Place Hotel for 3 nights... it was splendid!! the room is quite small but smart!! everything is very modern and they have room service twice a day. very good place as u can eat at the mall connected to the hotel, and u can even do ur last minute shopping there.. very close to ladies street but not that much to buy compare to temple street... the good thing about this hotel is that u just walk down the hotel and there is the MTR subway... very convenient even with ur shopping bags.... eventhough the room is quite expensive but it's just worth it esp when u want comfort.... esp recommended for lovers and honeymooners....

<Content>One of my all time favourite hotels I travel a lot for business  the quality of the Hotel makes a big difference to me. I really like the Langham Place and in comparison to the Hotels in HK Island or TST, think it is excellent value. The Hotel is brand spanking new and has a fresh contemporary feel to it without being boutique like. The rooms and facilities are really excellent, the MTR is a short walk so you can be anywhere in the area pretty quickly. I love the service (I think they pay people to stand around  smile !!) and the spa is wonderful (albeit a bit expensive)Only downside is that Mongkok itself is quite run down so apart from the Langham Place mall and the local markets you tend to spend 30 minutes on the MTR or in a Taxi going to the usual haunts like TST or Central.TIPS1) Buy an Octupus card, which is a pre-paid card upon which you load credit, it makes using public transport a breeze !2) Like all Hotels, the breakfast, while good, is expensive. I usually go to the nearby Mall where there is a Delifrance and Starbucks just across the walkway from the Hotel. 3) Taxi drivers don't all have good English  this Hotel seems less well known the some of the other more established ones. So you really need a card from the Hotel concierge with the name written in Chinese characters to ensure you get back !I always try to stay there when in HK  always enjoy the experience.

<Content>Deserves #1 ranking on Tripadvisor I am originally from Hong Kong and have family there. As a result, I've been back a number of times and know the Hong Kong area and its hotels quite well. We stayed for a week and a half and our experience was that Langham Place is a 5 star hotel. The service that we experienced was very high and they pay attention to details. For instance, they even put your slippers in just the right place in the right direction so that you're feet slip into them as you get out of bed. The hotel room is a fairly standard size for Hong Kong (which means a little small for Hong Kong by Western standards) but has a very comfortable, firm bed, plasma TV, internet phone, and tasteful decor. The rooftop pool is fully serviced and sometimes overstaffed. There is a nice spa, sauna, men's and women's lockers and club lounge. The location in MongKok is excellent if you want a taste of a local area in Hong Kong. Essentially all of the other 5 star hotels are clustered in Tsim Sha Tsui (a nice area but a tourist district) and Central (the financial district). The hotel is connected to a 13 story shopping mall (Langham Place Mall) that has many restaurants, shops and a movie theater. The hotel is also connected to the MongKok subway station. You can get to the mall or the subway via skybridge and the escalators without going outside. The concierge was helpful and everyone was beyond cordial. The pink elevator ladies are a nice touch. Because there are so many great restaurants to try in the MongKok area, I would suggest limiting dining inside the hotel. The restaurants inside the hotel are good but they are much more expensive than the surrounding restaurants. Try Guongzhou Garden inside the mall instead if you want top notch Cantonese service and food. Note that we paid about the equivalent of $90 (US dollars) per night due to a promotion by Cathay Pacific and purchased this through a Chinese travel agency in the United States. This is obviously a great deal but in general, the standard prices are still significantly lower than prices at 5 star hotels in Tsim Sha Tsui or Central. Everyone treated us well and we tipped the front desk and the concerige at our first contact with them (check-in). This can sometimes enhance the experience even at a good hotel.

<Content>Simply the best place to stay in Hong Kong! Stayed at the Langham Place Hotel in Mongkok for five nights with my elderly parents on a business-cum-pleasure trip to Hong Kong. Thus I am able to testify that this is an excellent hotel to stay at, either for work or for play.Paid for a Kowloon room with triple accommodation, which consists of a giant King sized bed, and a single bed, both extremely comfortable. The pillow menu is a nice touch, but hardly neccessary, as there were already three types of pillow provided as standard.Bathroom is extremely well-stocked. For the triple room, you don't get the clear glass partition that others appear to get with doubles - which was good for us, as my parents are not exactly liberal!The extra I paid to get access to the facilities in the lounge on the 36th floor is a good investment. It is a good place to relax, and there seems to be a constant supply of snacks and drinks (including cocktails) on tap. My father loved the message chair, which afforded relief for sore feet while offering an amazing view of the HK skyline. It is also easier to arrange to settle the bill and check out via the reception desk there, as the one in the lobby can be busy.The services at the hotel is impeccable, and I agree with previous reviewers, that the lobby and concierge services are friendly, warm and extremely welcoming. We never had to wait very long for anything, as everything was delivered extremely quickly, efficiently and with a smile.We preferred breakfast on the ground floor (as opposed to the lounge) as there was greater variety. Selection was pretty standard for 5* hotels (multinational cuisine). Services of the serving staff there could be variable, depending on where you sit and how busy they are. The hotel appears to be popular with foreign toursts, and we (ethnically Chinese) appeared to be in the minority!The hotel is situated in the middle of Mongkok, supposedly one of the most densely populated area in the world. Nevertheless, this is exactly what we loved to do - mingle with the locals and sampling the hussle and bustle of everyday life - so don't pick this location if you like a peaceful and quiet stroll! Access to other parts of Hong Kong were also extremely easy by the MTR via the mall next door - got to a wedding reception in Central on time without any problems, during a typhoon number 8 alert!I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The price may be on the top end, but I felt it was worth every single penny.

<Content>Poor Check-in service I booked my hotel room months in advance for our holiday to ensure the proper experience for my family. I paid extra to stay in 2 rooms on the Executive floors for 5 nights. My family and I waited in line at the front desk for 45 minutes after a transcontinental flight. Meanwhile, in line, I over heard the person in front of me get upgraded to an executive room free of charge because they didn't have a standard room available for him at that time. I gave Langham Place the benefit of the doubt since it was so highly regarded on tripadvisor. Eventually, my positive attitude turned sour when the front desk informed me that I would have to wait an additional THREE HOURS before my rooms were ready. I booked months in advance, watched as the person in front of me get an Executive room immediately as a free upgrade, and had to wait three hours with 45 minutes in line. My family and I were relegated to wander the hotel and streets exhausted from our long haul flight. No remedy was offered. I felt I paid full price for discount service and treatment.

<Content>Enjoyable experience Stayed during the Christmas period when it was extremely busy but found that they were friendly and informative. I think it had only just opened. We stayed on the executive floors and was slightly disappointed that the rooms were slightly smaller that the usual for a hotel of this class. However, everything was clean, and tha view from the upper floors were amazing. Could just about see Hong Kong Island.The swimming pool on the the top floor had the best views along with the gym on the level below. Also, it was one of the few times in a hotel where we had breakfast everyday. The menu changed from day to day and the food was good. A shopping centre is incorporated into the hotel and we were not far from the metro station.If you want everything to be close at hand, I think this is one of the better hotels on Kowloon side.

<Content>Great Location Firstly, Thankyou all who wrote revies of this hotel, as it helped me choose this great hotel to stay at for 4 nights. We stayed at the hotel, whilst re-locating back from the UK to Australia, and in need of a rest....with a 2 yr old child. We booked directly with the hotel, and also arranged a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel and vice versa. This was a great move, considering the luggage we had (Which would not of fit in a taxi) and for 180 each was not bad.The hotel itself was beautiful, and luxurious. The hotel was as described by other reviewers, and the room was big. We were upgraded to a club room (We choose not to go with the extras to have the actual club privledges - just the room). We were on the 35th floor (Which was a bit eary), but none the less had a good size room with a large bed. We choose not to get a cot for our 2 yr old, and had him in bed with us as there was plenty of room in the King sized bed for him. One complaint I had was that we arrived at 1am in the morning, and I asked where I could go for some Milk for my child. I was told we will arrange room service to deliver this to you. As I was tired I said ok, it might cost a bit, but I was curious why they did not suggest the 7-11 across the road. None the less a small glass of milk was delivered and I was charged 35 hong kong which is about 3 UK pounds. I complained the next morning and was given a credit for this, but it is something to be careful of.The location of the hotel was excellent. The hotel connects directly to the Langham shopping centre, where there is a great food hall where we ate dinner most nights. It was fun eating there as its the Chinese way and very cheap rather than eating in restaurants. The hotel was walking distance to the night markets and the Ladies market. Both places were great, and we did manage to spend quite a lot on the bargains at both markets....especially on hand-bags be a certain French designer. It is funny when they grab you and show you the catalogue for the bags....I guess what the markets are all about :-)The Metro station was close, and we went to Disneyland from there as well as downtown. It was cheap to use and efficient and cooler than walking in the ridiculous heat we were in in July. Disneyland was ok, I think the fact it was soooo hot spoilt it for us, but you cant blame the park for the whether. That said the park is reasonably small compared to other Disneylands, but still its a Disney at the end of the day.Overall the hotel is a great location, high quality and standard. It was pricey in my opinion, especially when tax and service are added to your hotel room rate. That said, I would stay again at the hotel, as its location location location.

<Content>Worth every single dollar Stayed there on our way back from Oz. Had booked a suite deal and pick up at the airport. Own separate check-in and all handled v. swiftly. We were travelling with a 6month old baby and the hotel were brilliant. The suite was lovely, bed very comfy, location great. we booked a babysitter and explored the temple street night markets which were close by. On our last day we had booked an extended check out which was 50% of the night rate but there was a problem with our suite and when we complained we were upgraded to a bigger suite and not charged for our final day....Absolutely brilliant customer service.The club lounge was great, afternoon tea, cocktail hour and drinks late at night. all free..Would go back in a second

<Content>Another good review Spent three nights at the hotel at the end of a quick trip around the region. Room was OK size wise but the two twins beds only had two inches between them so room was fairly small even though we were in the higher floors. Maybe it was to make room for the separate shower in the bathroom? Blissful bed is not quite there according to my princess daughter who wondered where they managed to get such a hard pillow top matress. But it was the best one we found in the region. Pool was fine and needed after a long day sighseeing. View from pool area on roof is fantastic. Service was fine in the hotel (though still trying to work out what job Eunice the other hatted ladies have in the lobby except to push elevator buttons) and I think it is a great base for a visit to Hong Kong. The Ladies Market is two mins away and the MTR downstairs. Food court in next door mall is a great way to get a cheap quick meal although gets very busy. Mall also had a good selection of teenage clothes in a Trendz section so for someone like me dragging a daughter around was a great choice to keep her busy.

<Content>A truly great Hong Kong hotel in vibrant Mong Kok Having always stayed on the island, I was unsure about busy Mong Kok. My apprehension soon disappeared upon arrival! This is a wonderful hotel and represents extremely good value for money in HK where quality does not come cheap. I would highly recommend the Club Floor. A wonderful lounge; the first I have ever been in that is truly 24hrs with full bar facilities and food served over this time. The rooms are large, new and very tastefully furnished. Up to date and easy to use technology. Staff are attentive and helpful and very well trained. Great restaurants! The MTR station is easily accessed in the basement of the hotel. I don't think I will return to the Island again and really enjoyed the 'real Hong Kong which this neighbourhood is. I always felt very safe. Well done team Langham Place- we will look forward to seeing you again soon!

<Content>The hotel made my trip... i wasn't convinced that there was that much to do in Hong Kong itself but staying in this hotel totally made my trip. The standards of service are excellent - puts most other hotels that i have stayed in to shame.The pool is on the top floor of the building and is open air. Swimming in the rain (do I feel a song coming on, perhaps not!) was an odd experience but the facilities on offer are superb.And then there's the massage facilities. I've never had a massage in my life but the menu provided in my room looked so tempting that I just had to indulge. What an experience! I felt totally at ease, despite being a little nervous about the whole experience but it was such a relaxing couple of hours which they will gear towards your specific needs (e.g. I get a lot of tension headaches so they focussed upon the upper back etc).Overall and excellent experience in a place that I was a little indifferent to, to be honest.

<Content>It is simple why it is No 1 on Trip advisor We stayed here for a week in Mongkok. This is on the Kowloon side and Mogkok means busy corner - and it certainly is - you get a real bustle for the city.As for the room, it was fantastic - a very complete package - you can view the TV from the bath tub even!The bed was listed as a blissful bed - and it certainly was that. There is also a pillow menu to pick your own pillows.As for the location, it is part of the Langham Place Mall which is linked to Mongkok MRT station - so you can get across very quickly - HK$5 one way to TST in Kowloon. It is right in the heart of the Chinese market - so it gets very busy especially in the evening - certainly not for people who want serenity - but watching the bustle below mixing with the neon signs a la Blade Runner is a sight to seeThe staff are friendly ans corteous and ever ready to help - the Club Lounge is fantastic and well worth having for free drinks, continental breakfast and cocktails throught the day/night.Overall, it's been No 1 here on trip advisor - the other hotels have a bit of catching up to do

<Content>Good Hotel Just returned from Hong Kong, where I resided five days at the Langham Place, inspired by the reviews on this site. I decided to stay at this hotel not only because of the overall favorably opinions but mainly because of the rapport between quality and price, which turned out to be excellent. For a good hotel with great amenities and services, it was reasonable. I am not a fan of huge hotels of this type, but I found that the service was maintained on all levels. I loved the spa and the outdoor pool which was big enough with an amazing view.

<Content>Great hotel, great location, great lounge We stayed in Langham Place over the holy week in a 3 bed room Suite in the Club Floor. We had a twin room and a room with an extra bed. The rooms were spacious enough to commemorate us well. The extra bed was a little short but pretty comfortable. The big flat screen TV sets in both rooms were a nice feature too. Beside a nice and well lit bathroom with shower, bathtub and toilet we had another toilet room in the suite which was very well received being a party of 3. The rooms had a view over Kowloon rather than Hongkong Island but it was pretty impressive nevertheless.I really liked the Club Floor lounge which had a good selection of drinks and snacks all day long. Also there were three computers with internet access and printers for us to use for free.The restaurant was a little disappointing, so-so dinner for quite expensive prices. Breakfast was great though, large selections ranging from continental, British, Japanese to Chinese. The foodcourt and restaurants of the adjoining Langham Mall were the better choice for dinner or lunch. Through the Mall located in Mongkok you also have access to the Metro bringing you to Hongkong Island.Overall I can recommend this Hotel for business and leisure and will go there again for my next trip to HK.

<Content>I could have stayed in the changing rooms !! This place is just great ! The rooms are perfect, the spa is great, but quite expensive, the gym is fantastic, but the best place of all is the changing rooms ! They have a chinese hot tub, a steam room, a sauna, a swim suit dryer, lockers, toiletries, big white fluffy towels, sterilized hairdryers and so on. all with candles and relaxing music. I spent an hour in the gym and then and hour here every day. I was so pleased nothing in Hong Kong opened until 10 am !!

<Content>Location, Location, Location My family consisting of my husband, 2 children (8  6) and my mother stayed here for 8 days. What a fabulous location. What more could you ask for a huge shopping centre adjoing the hotel, MTR at the bottom of the shopping centre. The excitment and fantastic shopping of Mongkok just outside the doors!!! The beds were extremely confortable (especially when we had stayed a few nights earlier in our trip at another hotel and the bed was like an ironing board). We had booked 1 residence suite which consisted of a small kitchen/lounge with separate King bed and adjoining to the suite was a club room with a queen bed. Being on the club floor is sure worth the little extra upgrade cost. It is so relaxing to be able to come back after a busy day shopping or sightseeing and being able to kick back and watch the most wonderful views from the 36th floor with a wonderful glass of red. The children were most welcome in the club as we have experienced at different hotels where children are not permitted into the club....!!!! This is something that I alway now check with. All in all if you are staying in HK this is definately my pick.

<Content>The room was small The room is very small for five star hotel. I have checked in at 16.30 but was told that the room was not available, have to wait for one hour. After I got to the room,I found out the it was not twin bed room that I had made a reservasion. I had to call the reception and was told that by the evening the bed will be changed. I was very upset with the service I got and would not return back to this hotel again. This is very poor serseve coparing to HK five stars hotel.

<Content>Oops but it was OK Made a big mistake and booked the hotel for 2 days arriving one day before scheduled. Got to the airport and found the Langham Place driver (don't look around the arrivals area - walk towards the back of Arrivals A to find the Langham Place Desk).He advised that we were 24 hrs late and we would be charged for the first night. A quick call and we were waived the previous night and rebooked for the following two.Penalty was we had to take a smoking room (because we are 5 people and needed 2 adjacent rooms). Didn't smell that badHotel located very well close to Ladies Market  Mongkok Shopping. Also straight downstairs to MTR station which will take you anywhere. Get the Octopus Card or make sure you have some change $20 HK or coins for automatic machines.Tried reataurant in Hotel (Ming) which was great but probably cheaper outside.Little Pink Ladies at Concierge are a great help ( even if they ask you 'how long are you stopping' every time you get in and out of elevator).On a value for money measure very pleased with this hotel and would probably return

<Content>Fabulous Hotel Beautifully appointed hotel common areas and room. Stayed on the Clublevel that provided quality meals (full breakfast, tea for lunch, andvarious snacks at other times) and drinks (a variety of wines, soft drinks, expresso machine, alcohol) from 6:30AM to 11PM. Free internetand computer usage at Club, as well as 2 massage chairs. Club facilities are also first rate - very comfortable, spacious, and generally quite (with the exception of noisy Americans!) Quality of the room and hotel was very high quality; room amenities include a very comfortable bed, Plasma TV, soft towels and bedding, modern bathwith tub and shower, and robes. I was upgraded to a studio - I believe room #s XX01 are those - that had fabulous views of the Hong Kong island and building skyline, as well as Kowlooon penisula and bay. Room appointments are all first rate and worthy of a five star quality rating.Room service - all good quality, reasonable prices considering. Ceasar salad disappointing, as was the hamburger (not sure what sort of meat was used). Tomato soup and noodle soups were very good and reasonable.Spa/gym faciilities are excellent - also included as part of the clublevel surcharge - modern exercise equipment with many treadmills, ellipticals and a few bikes. Weights include free weights and machines - all of very good quality. Exercise facility has lots of natural light with excellent views of the city. Spa facilities were moderately spacious, very clean and included dry and wet sauna, as well as soaking pool. Pool area was a bit small, but provided nice contrast to hustle and bustle of the city. Sort of difficult to sunbathe, due to building design.I had originally planned to stay one night to recover from a 21 day trip of China - I ended up staying three more nights and rarely left the hotel. The hotel made a great finish to my trip. Highly recommended.

<Content>Excellent Hotel would highly recommend it The fact this is No.1 tells you all you need to know, great hotel and great value. The rms were lovely with fantastic power shower and comfy bed just what you need after a long flight. Service was very good. There were lots of really nice little touches that made it a first class place to stay.Don't miss: - pillow menu  turndown service.- 10min underground ride to island.- the swimming pool on the roof great views and lovely changing facilities.- breakfast lots to choose from - we made the mistake of sleeping in with jet lag the first day and breakfast finishes at 10am.- free internet.- you are walking distance from the Ladies market in Mongkok so pay it a visit and don't forget to haggle you can get some real bargains. There are lots of cheap clothes shops near there too, cheaper than some of the ones in the shopping centre that the hotel is attached to.

<Content>Loved the Langham Our family stayed at the Langham for 4 days. The location was excellent, and conveniently located near the ferries and lots of shopping (isn't that why you go to Hong Kong?) The hotel was very clean and the staff was very attentive. Very luxurious hotel. The restaurant buffet was delicous.

<Content>Love this hotel I visit Hong Kong about 3-4 times a year and usually stay at the Conrad. I decided to give this hotel a try as they had a special deal for suites and I am so glad I did. The rate I paid was cheaper than a regular room at the Conrad (although they always upgrade me to the Executive floor, being a HHonors Diamond). I had a Residence Suite and it's actually a sitting room with full kitchen and a bedroom. The Grohe fixtures in the bathroom were very nice and I certainly appreciate the big (46 inch?) plasma televisions in both rooms. The only complaint I had was the bedroom was a little on the small side but the choice of pillows was certainly a nice touch and the mattress was nice and firm. I like to watch TV in bed and was surprised to note that the TV did not have a timer switch. The service was excellent and all the staff I came into contact with were very helpful. I love the location as I enjoy walking around Mongkok and Hong Kong being hot and humid in June, it was so nice to be able to duck back into the hotel for a quick shower and change of clothing everytime I got hot and sweaty. I already made the reservation for my trip in the Fall and I hope they continue the Suite deal next year.

<Content>First class all the way! My wife is sooo picky about Hotels, however she had nothing but praise for Langham Place from the second we arrived at their counter at the airport. We had nothing but 6 star service from that point. We arrived at 9am for a three night stop. Got our room at 11am (an hour earlier than booked) - had breakfast in the attached Langham Place shopping centre while waiting. Great view from our 29th Floor room. On the third day, while trying to resolve a family crisis at home, we had major problem with the phones in the room, which was professionally resolved by the front desk manager and his team. Breakfast was a buffet with an extensive variety in a pleasant open environment. Rooftop pool and spa (jacuzzi) were so relaxing. They also have a Spa on the top 2 floors for massages and other therapies. Staff were so helpful and so many of them! MTR (Metro) is accessed through the connected shopping centre. This is now the only hotel we would consider in Hong Kong.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, fantastic service This is a beautiful hotel with fantastic service and a really convenient location. We hadn't booked the executive / club package but were given a room upgrade as the hotel was full. We were persuaded to pay a supplement to upgrade to the club package to give us access to the club lounge - beer  wine available through the day plus spirits  champagne for a couple of hours each evening. There are great snacks available and an excellent complimentary breakfast. In honesty I wouldn't pay the supplement next time as the rest of the hotel is so luxurious  fabulous that it's not really necessary and I also found the club lounge a bit lacking in atmosphere.Our room on the 36th floor was amazing - the views over the city are just incredible  the clear glass wall between bedroom  bathroom means that you can enjoy the view from the shower!You can get to the MTR (underground) station via the walkway to the mall or turn left out of the hotel then first right which we found a bit quicker although either way is only a couple of minutes. The MTR service is superb - you're never more than 5 minutes from a station and the longest we ever waited for a train was 3 minutes. You should definitely buy an Octopus card to make your travel really easy. You can use the card on the underground, on buses, on the star ferry, at 7-11s and at drinks dispensers in the stations so it's really convenient  great value.

<Content>My detailed review of this fine hotel I stayed here for 6 nights and was impressed. As our airport limo wasnearing the hotel at night, we were a little worried at how the Mong Kok area looked and wondered if we made a mistake, but the next day we explored and felt totally safe. Just keep away from the west side of hotel (Reclaimation St and over). Some say the hotel is out of theway, but it makes up for it with the Langham Place mall attached and also a MTR station downstairs which has you minutes away from Tsim Sha Tsui, HK island etc. Subways are spotless and I know the routes rather well by now. The Ladies Market is kinda trashy, low class vendors bracing for bargaining. As I walked past several stalls I canhear the vendors actually yelling at the tourists if they couldnt close the deal. I bought a Swiss watch, which worked for a day, when the maid empties the trash can, I hope she doesnt think it works. Save your shopping for Nathan rd. The Bird Market, hmmm stay away..when we were in hotel we heard on news they shut it down because a bird was infected with bird flu, this was June 16th. They showed the health people spraying the area and the shop owners were livid, screaming about the closings. Dont chance it. All other surrounding streets spark the senses, interesting to see one of the most crowded areas in the world pulsate. We wanted to see a HK horserace so we took the KCR rail to Sha Tin Racecourse. It was an awesome experience, not like the USA tracks. There wasnt cursing, spitting, throwing programs or yelling. It was orderly and really a pretty track. From Langham take the Mong Kok KCR to dedicated Racecourse stop..which was about 14 minutes away. Bring your passport for free admission, we sprung for the Members Club which was air conditioned, well worth it. If you like Malls, Times Square is the best, take MTR to causeway bay and exit at Times square ramp. The pavilion is picture perfect. You must do the Peak, and eat at The Lookout, reserve for a table looking over the city. We went forbreakfast and it was almost empty. We did the HK sponsered Tai Chi classes offered at the Museum of Art near the Star ferry in Tsim Sha Tsui. The instructor was fantastic, really into his Tai Chi, many locals were there as volunteers. The Canton Rd mall and shops were kinda pricy and dont have that HK feel. Also visit the Temple on Nathan Rd about 5 minute walk north of Police Station. Dont choke on the incense smoke, it is overbearing but its an experience watching the locals give their offerings. Respect their privacy, no photos, however they allowed us to take pics if people werent in pic. I can go on forever, I love Hong Kong. My only donts are the Ladies Market and Bird Market. The Langham Mall has great food choices on 4th floor, actually quite cheap for good food. Oh another 'dont'...I wouldnt eat from those vendors with the meat and squid out in open, I saw several instances where they handled the food and touched theirfaces, dirty water etc. Well, I got off track, this was supposed to be a hotel review, its great, the 5th floor work/play area..free internet and a bar with superb eats, kinda pricy. The pool is sweet and the treadmills make you feel like youre walking over the city. The breakfast was excellent, Im a Dim Sum and sushi addict and they had both. Rooms are small but we basically slept there only, so no big deal.

<Content>Perfect Hotel Fantastic hotel, the only slight gripe was that our room was slightly smaller than others we stayed in during our trip. Pool is an amazing experience, the rest of the spa area is superbly executed. The link to the mall, the excellent restaurants and cafes, and the proximity to the MTR are major pluses. But the very best thing is walking into the neighbourhood, its not like further up in Kowloon where there are tourists everywhere, this is a vibrant, real and very chinese part of town. I love the combination of a crazy street scene, and a beautiful hotel when you've had enough of it.

<Content>There's a reason why it's no. 1 in TripAdvisor ! First of all, as ever thanks to all of you who submit advice on this site - it's never let me down yet.As per the instructions on this site, I splashed out for the Executive deal. This gives you access to the Club room which gives you free food and drink from 6:30am to around midnight. There are also 2 PCs and one Mac you can use which have internet access and a printer, plus the views from the room over HK are amazing. All of the staff at the hotel are polite and seem eager to please.The hotel is connected to a shopping mall and underground station, so is ideally situated. It's also a short walk from the Lady's Market and Temple Street markets, as well as a street selling cameras, iPods and mobile phones; although if like me you've come from the UK, I don't think the prices to be had there - and believe me, I shopped around - are worth it, especially if you get caught at customs.Anyway, the hotel is wonderful and I would go there again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Excellent 1 night stayover I was at the end of my 2.5 week trip through Asia, during which I had gone to Singapore to meet with my vendor, gone to Guangzhou to meet with my client, back to Singapore to get engaged (yes you read that correctly), and then to Hong Kong to meet with client. Needless to say, I was incredibly tired and just wanted a nice place to stay that was convenient.Langham Place hotel turned out to be the exact remedy I needed. For one the location in Mongkok is central, it's connected to a mall and the busy shopping area (including the infamous Ladies Night Market where it's like Thailand's Chattuchuk market but in Cantonese). The hotel was well-appointed, the bed comfortable, bathroom clean, and even though I didn't have much a view I didn't really care. It was just nice to stay in a nice place that was reasonable from a price perspective.The only regret that I had was that I couldn't use the much-talked about spa as they were fully booked. I did manage to go see the rooftop pool that's a part of the spa, and it was very impressive.Next time I'm in Hong Kong I think I might stay here as opposed to Hong Kong Island as the transportation is incredibly convenient, it's closer to the airport, and there is obviosuly a lot to do in Kowloon. However most of all, I really liked this hotel a lot and wouldn't mind coming back for a longer stay, including a few hours in the spa.

<Content>Good - but not dazzling After spending four nights at the Langham Place hotel in Mong Kok, I was surprised to see it atop Trip Advisor's ratings for Hong Kong. It's not that the hotel has major flaws - indeed, our stay was quite pleasant - but it wasn't extraordinary either. Langham Hotels maintain two properties in Hong Kong; the Mong Kok location is a bit farther from the main tourist attractions, while the other hotel is more centrally located. Had I the chance to do it over, I would not opt for the Mong Kok location. That said, the room was clean and comfortable, the staff very helpful. The hotel is connected to a mall by a sky bridge, so there's a food court, coffee shops, and a host of stores just a few steps away. Free internet was a nice perk, too.

<Content>One of My Favorite Hotels A little about me, I'm a college graduate with an Architecture degree and am not rich by any means and thus don't have the funds to stay at hotels of a luxurious sort and though I have been fortunate enough to stay at some pretty suave hotels in my short life The Langham Place was simply one of the best. Though I would have preferred a hotel located on the HK Island side of the harbor the location was fantastic. Getting to the hotel was a simple bus ride away from the airport and you literally do not have to go above ground to get from the MTA station to the hotel. The hotel is connected to a brand new shopping mall (with a Starbucks right outside the lobby) and the famous Mong Kok shopping markets right outside the doors. The design is hip and wonderfully fun. The hotel bar is hopping with live music at night and the spa, gym and rooftop pool are all free for hotel guests to use. The gym may not be fully equipped and I'm sorry to say I did not try paying for the full spa treatment but the rooftop pool was spectacular. The room features were wonderful and the bathroom was a design treat. Don't forget to ask for an iPod stereo if you happen to bring your iPod. And while there's free internet downstairs there's only a few computers and it's slow but to get the quick connection in your room you have to pay around $20 a night. So all in all the hotel was amazing. So much so that it was dangerous because we spent much more of our five days in Hong Kong enjoying the hotel than we would have liked to. And that's one of the biggest compliments I can give it.

<Content>living the future at its best at the present time Like the title, if you like to experience an amazing life in the future at the present time, you have to stay in this hotel. It will put any American, European five star hotel that charge more to shame. The service, the views, the rooms, the cleanliness, the employees, the architecture, the food, and everything about it just makes you real content , happy, and thankful that you were there to experience all that. We took the escape package and we're already planning to come back to stay longer next time to live another amazing adventure in the future at the present time!

<Author>Incognitosu
<Content>A great hotel to return to Stayed at Langham Place for 3 nights from 18 May in the standard twinroom. Overall, had a great experience and would definitely recommend the hotel to friends and all.Read that many before me had already gushed at length about the hotel. Nevertheless, because we had visited Hong Kong on a particularly rainy season, we really came to appreciate all the little things that make up Langham Pl.What makes Langham Pl. a great sanctuary to return to, especially after a rain-soaked day out:- the ginger flower scented lobby is a welcomed salve from the assault of your olfactory senses by the damp rain and smells of street food (the notorious smelly tofu included).- the specially created Blissful Bed rejuvenated us with restful sleep- Life can be closer to a bed of roses if you try out their wonderfully scented rose pillow from an array offered by the pillow menu.- a tub to soak your aches away and within easy reach of your fingers, a little pulley to elevate the screen shielding the glass-walled bathroom, so you can enjoy the cable offerings of the plasma TV from the comfort of your bubble bath.- connected walkway from hotel lobby to the food level of Langham Place Mall lets you grab a quick and convenient bite while keeping you dry.- the connectivity of the hotel (through the mall) to the MTR makes for convenient access and much welcomed shelter from the on pouring rain.- IP telephony gadget in room allows you to check up on the directoryof the interlinked mall so you can preview the variety of eating establishments and know exactly which outlet to head to for that crabcongee, even before you step out of the comfort of your room.- Ipod compatible sound system to dock your Ipod and wake up to your favourite tunes- nightly turn-down service that ensures your bed is ready for bedtime and that you have a bottle of water and a glass handy by yourbedside.- free 24hr internet access at the PCs/Macs available at their 5th floor should you need to check that urgent email.- concierge that speak impeccable English and are always ready to point you in the right direction with a proffered map or a hotel cardto take to your cab driver.- warm and friendly lift ladies who greet you from afar and anticipate your every need - which floor are you heading to? Do you need directions out of the hotel? While I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Langham Place, I must say that its location may not be most ideal for everyone. While Mongkok is adored by many travelers as it鈥檚 where the lively street markets are and it adds much local colour to their stay, if you are on a tight-scheduled shopping trip however, you may prefer to stay at the Tsim Sha Tsui or Causeway Bay area - where the malls are. Especially if you are visiting Hong long for its summer sale to do some serious shopping. More quality buys can be found in the above areas, rather than the flea markets of Mong Kok. That said, Langham Pl is only a mere couple of stops away from TST and probably less than 30min MTR ride to Causeway Bay.Some may also find the standard rooms a little small. To be frank, due to space constraints, our twin beds were placed so close together, they could have been mistaken for a double-room instead! However, we don鈥檛 feel crammed in a confined space, perhaps due to the clever use of mirrored surfaces and walls to optically 鈥渆nlarge鈥?the interiors and also the much appreciated floor to ceiling windows that offer vantage views if you reside on the higher floors.Things that can help top my already enjoyable Langham Pl. experience?- management could start paying more attention to the maintenance of the bathroom. While the rest of the bathroom was immaculate, my bathtub was a tad stained and found a few stray hairs on the tub. Nothing a quick rinse of water couldn't get rid of ...but it'll be better if the guests didn't have to see them.- could do with a second set of bath toiletries for twin-share/double-room guests- really adore the ginger flower scent so would be nice if guests areoffered the option to have the same scent spritzed in their rooms as part of turn-down service... but that could just be my personal preference.....- could be less stringent on the late checkout. We could only get a complimentary late-checkout till 1pm. Anytime thereafter is subjectedto hourly charges. I've been to many hotels that could offer complimentary late checkout to 3pm at least. Although at Langham Pl. you could still head up to the spa/pool level after check out and use its facilities for freshening up.- discount on the hefty printing charges please? Was charged HKD 8 per page for printing e-tickets on level 5. gulp.

<Content>Loved it! Stayed at the Langham Place for 2 nights and loved it! Great shuttle bus service from airport to hotel - good when you want the easy option of being dumped of at the front door when you're jet lagged!The roof top pool is out of this world and the gym has a good range of equipment for a hotel. Great access to the trains from Mong Kok station made getting around very easy. Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Nice Hotel Stayed at the the Langham this past March. Had booked a club room, got upgraded to a club suite upon arrival. Very nice, wonderful view, a bottle of champaigne and chocolates were waiting as we were celebrating a special ocassion, on the floor check-in/out, great plasma TVs (3) in the suite, free drinks 6-8 PM I believe, free breakfast, great omelettes, just nice. The location is fascinating to say the least, in old Hong Kong. Very colorful, have to see the street market by the hotel, most everything is alive, quite an experience. As for the location, we thought it was a little far from the main attractions, since most of the action, night life, etc. is in the harbor section. However, we crisscrossed the city one day in taxis for just about $20US. Which brings me to a great experience we had with a taxi driver. We hailed it to go from the jade market to a buddist temple (we had all the destinations written in chinese by hotel staff since taxi drivers speak very little English). When pointing to the driver where we wanted to go, he saw the name and location of the hotel we were staying at thinking we wanted to go there. Ended-up leaving my eye glasses in the car, case and all. I thought for sure I'll never see them again. Wouldn't you know, the driver remembered us (we were the only westerners in that particular temple) and the hotel we were staying, and returned them when his shift was over in late afternoon. Unbelievable. Security at the hotel is pretty tight, my wife smokes, only allowed outside the hotel, and whenever she went for a cigarrette in front of the hotel she'd be assigned a door man to watch over her, and the same for other guests who went outside for a smoke. It makes you wonder about the general safety of the area. However we walked around, day time, without incident. All-in-all, had a great time in Hong Kong and at the Lamgham.

<Content>Experience to contrast LANGHAM PLACE HOTEL MONGKOKReviewer: Member from Queensland Australia.What a vast contrast finding a 5 Star hotel situated in the New Territories market area, but this first class hotel had all the comforts of home plus lots more.We had an Executive room on the 23rd.floor-did not actually see any of the other rooms though. Had booked King Sized bed but were told on checking in this would be rectified the next day, which to their word it was.Rooms are not large, but very comfortable. Every item you would reasonably expect is in the room. Large plasma screen TV is great to view from the bed without the need to put on the specs.Room is servied twice daily, once to make up the room in the morning, the in the evening to turn back the bed and change towels if necessary. We found the room very clean. Shoe shine service is on a daily basis if required and gratis.Bathroom is quite spacious with a large shower, and has both slider hand held shower head, plus an overhead fixed shower which is great for shampooing hair.Tea and coffee facilities are in abundance and great selection of various types of teas. Japanese as well as Chinese teas, plus usual western English and breakfast teas.Restaurants are well laid out and quite spacious. Staff are very friendly, courteous and cannot do enough for you. They always greet you with a smile and thank you politely as you leave. There is a 10 per cent service charge on top of meals, but couldnt find out if it was a Goods  service tax, and accoding to what we learnt is not part of any gratuity for staff. Meals can be a little on the high side, but quite comparable with others around the Ocean terminal in the Tsim Sha Tsui area. Bath towels are very big, almost the size of a single bed blanket.Two 500 ml bottles of Bonaqua water are left in room each day-these too are free.At the entrance, and around the reception area Pink Ladies greet you as you arrive and leave the hotel, and attended to getting you into the lift. They are really terrific are so petite dressed in suits of pink with black hats, almost impish with friendly mannerisms. They won't or aren't allowed to accept tips.Although in a relatively high density living area closely resembling slums, we never felt uneasy walking around.

<Content>Excellent ! Me, my wife, and my 2 kids had a wonderful stay in Langham Place Hotel in Mongkok from May 5-9, 2007. Upon arrival, we went up to the lobby which was located on the 4th floor. It was not as big and wide as I had seen in official hotel photos, but did not lose any of the glitter and elegance nonetheless. Staff was proficient in English, very attentive, and even upgraded me to an executive room. True enough, there were 2 ladies in red who will press the elevator buttons for you. The room was not big as compared to other hotels, but it is not cramped in any way. The bed was huge. 4 of us slept on it, together with 9 pillows and 2 stuffed toys which my kids brought along. I have read from a tripadvisor review before complaining about the legs of the bed. He was correct. We hurt our toes many times hitting the bed's legs. It should have been moved a little bit inward to clear our feet. Impressive was the 42 plasma tv hung on the wall, with a multitude of satellite channels to choose from. But the tv doesn't react to the remote control instantly. You have to wait for maybe 3 or 5 seconds. There was a dvd player which we never got to use.The Cisco IP phone on the office table was also a great feature. You can set up wake-up calls, check your running bill in real time, check voice messages, and sort through among a lot of useful info. There was a coffee maker with water kettle, lots of complimentary stuff like ground coffee, instant coffee, Milo chocolate drink, and a wide variety of tea. The bathroom was exactly like in the pictures I have seen before. The glass sink was so elegant. You can watch tv while inside the tub. There was a speaker in the bathroom so you can hear the tv too. I wish there was a bidet on the toilet seat as commonly found in Korean hotels. The glass wall may be very nice for honeymooners. I wish the roll down shade would be improved. There was still a gap of about an inch when the shades are down. I was surprised when I was taking a shower and the kids were laughing out loud.They were peeking as I was taking a bath!Other nice amenities were the ipod cradle, ironing board, the big safe where you can put your laptop inside as you charge, the pillow menu where you can ask for additional free pillows. We were happily surprised to have complimentary wine and chocolates because it was our 12th wedding anniversary. They are thoughtful enough to have provided an umbrella for you to use in case the weather gets bad.One of the things I thought that needed to be changed was the door closer. I do not know if it is hydraulic or spring activated, but is sure makes opening the door difficult. Should be adjusted to make the door feel lighter. Making things worse was the door knob. It did not give a good grip if you are opening the door from inside. And if you are entering the room, you'd have to lean your shoulder onto the door as you insert the key card on the main switch panel. The swimming pool on the 42nd floor was nothing grand at all, but the changing room on the 41st floor was impressive. Supplies were generous like hair gel, mouthwash, clean disinfected hair brush, shaving kits, and comb. You can even use the spinner drier to remove excess water from your bathing suit/trunks. There was a hot tub with the water maintained at 42 degrees C. I didnt try it as I felt it was too hot for me. There was a steam room as well. The elevators were inconsistent. Sometimes, it was instantly ready. Sometimes, we had to wait for at least 3 minutes to get a ride down to the lobby. After 11pm, you must have your card key with you to activate the elevator. You'll have to insert the card, then pull it out after a few seconds, then the buttons will work. And there was a tv screen in the elevator showing black  white movies from half a century ago. In my opinion, it would have been better if it just shows news bulletins pertinent to guests, like weather reports or CNN. If you like to try authentic Hong Kong cuisine that is not expensive, there is a cooked food market just beside the hotel along Shanghai Road. Take the escalators up and it is a dining hall with around 15 kiosks selling a variety of authentic HK meals. Cheap at HK$12 a meal. There was not a single English menu in sight, but I tried kiosk # 12 and I was surprised that the lady there spoke English well. She explained to me all her menu. If you like roast meats on rice, try the outlets along Argyle corner Shanghai, which is just a stone's throw away. 7-11 and KFC and Watson's are all nearby. McDonald's is across Nathan but is just about 8 minutes walk. There is a money changer nearby, just behind the hotel, along Shanghai Street near the corner of Argyle. But still, those inside Chungking Mansion in TST give the best rate. If you cant go to TST for the money changers, there are 2 changers along Soy Street between Portland and Nathan that have good rates also. One of the advantages of this hotel is the proximity to Sai Yeung Choi street that sells a lot of electronic goods, Fa Yuen Street that sells rubber shoes, and Tung Choi Street which is the Ladies Market. All shops in these streets open till at least 11pm, some even till midnight. MTR station is also around the corner. Before leaving, there was a feedback form which I filled out. There were 2 pencils in the room, and both of them broke their tips immediately. A hotel of this status should use better pens/pencils. Generally, i find this hotel much much better than most hotels I have stayed in. The pros outweigh the cons. I will surely come back to this hotel when I visit HK again.

<Content>Can't beat this hotel! Everything written about this hotel is true. Booking a club room is definitely worth the extra cost. Superb service. Great position for those that want to be in the midst of old Hong Kong, but stay in a state-of-the-art hotel. We walked everywhere. Nelson Street with its live fish market, fruits, vegetables and meat stalls is just as remembered 40 years ago, as is the whole area. The flower and bird markets are just around the corner. And we thought an easy and interesting walk to the Star Ferry and thus to Victoria.

<Content>Perfect Location Not much to add to all the other reviews.For me, hotels are all about location. Ultimately, you dont spend half your holiday in the hotel.This hotel has an ideal location. Near to all the local markets, and on top of a large shopping mall. Also right on top of an MTR station- from the time you leave your room, it is c 25 m ins by MTR to the island.Have seen some comments about the size of the rooms- I stayed in a normal one. I was on my own and the room was perfect. Even if sharing, should be fine unless planning to spend a long time in the room itself.The bed and pillows are so comfy- perfect for sleeping off jetlag.I dont normally use or notice hotel staff. All the employees at the hotel were amazing. All smiling and wanted to help. Asked the concierge a question about being able to check in for my flight at the train station. Within 2 mins he had phoned the station and had the answer. Also so helpful with questions about itineries. The hotel also does a good cocktail nite every thursday between 6 and 8- free to residents.Recommend the hotel bar's happy hour between 6 and 8 (I think). They dont skimp on the measures.Downsides? If you like a lot of fresh fruit for breakfast, you will be disappointed- mainly tinned fruit. But the omelettes were goodLocation wise, for mixing with locals and easy accessibility to the main tourist sites, this is the hotel for you. If you want to spend your time clubbing and getting pissed, stay on the island (please!).

<Content>What An Experience Wow, where to begin ?We stayed for four nights in a Langham Suite and our final night in the Chuan Infinity Suite, each with access to the Langham Hotel Club executive facility.Firstly the rooms. The Langham Suite was lovely. It has a large lounge and fully equipped kitchenette. The super-king bed is incredibly comfortable and the bathroom has a separate bath and excellent shower. As mentioned in other reviews it also has a glass wall to the bedroom, with mechanised screens. The room also has large flat screen TVs and dvd players in lounge and bedroom, wireless broadband and floor to ceiling windows overlooking Kowloon.The Chuan Infinity Suite is something else. It is incredibly luxurious. The whole room is done immaculately in dark wood and again has two large TVs, internet etc. and also console controlled ambient lighting and music. The real attraction of this room though is the bathroom. It contains a lovely infinity bath with hydrotherapy and chromotherapy, plus separate toilet, shower room and steam room ! The photos on the web site do not do it justice.The service that we received from the hotel and the club facility was amazing. They were incredibly friendly and brought out special vegetarian food for my wife every evening that we were there. One of the waiters even took a trip out to a local market to buy a whole range of vegetarian meat substitute dishes and served this to us one evening with a range of vegetables. In every respect, the staff went above and beyond the call of duty.The spa and the treatments were amazing too 鈥?highly recommended.The location of the hotel on Kowloon is fine. It is very close to the city MTR underground system (depending on how you navigate the journey) meaning that you can quickly get to most places in the city. It is also on the doorstep of the more traditional markets too.All in all, I cannot recommend the Langham Place hotel highly enough. I honestly don鈥檛 think I can find anything to improve on.

<Content>Loved it! One of my favourite hotels I have ever stayed in (if not the favourite!). Service is fabulous. We had an executive room which had an amazing view across Hong Kong. The (large) bed was covered in pillows and we had fun ordering extra lavender and rose pillows from the pillow menu. The bathroom is glass walled with a blind so you can see directly out to the views. The down side of this is having to put the blind down if you want a bit of privacy in the bathroom within the room.TV was flat screen, came with DVD player that took multi region DVDs. The hotel is not longer suppling DVDs as it want you to watch pay for view movies so bring your own.The lobby and bar is beautiful and one of the hotel restaurants serves an amazing buffet although I thought the restaurant a bit too large and open to the shopping mall to have much atmosphere.The rooftop pool and spa is beautiful and the massage was very welcome after a long flight. Its is a bit on the expensive side but then this is Hong Kong.

<Content>My new favorite hotel in Hong Kong!!! Let me start off by saying I have been going to HK for almost 20 years. I have stayed at the Regent (Now the intercontinental), the Harbour Plaza(s), as well as the Sheraton, Nikko, Shangri La, and a few others.This hotel is located in Mong Kok which is 3 stops from Tsim Sha Tsui (waterfront area) on the MTR (Subway).Side note - The best way to get around HK is using the MTR. It's clean, safe, and super effecient. Takes a little getting used too but the transit authority has made it so user friendly that you wont want to move around HK any other way.I have always been partial to the Harbour Plaza because it was Regent Quality  Service at Sheraton prices. Please see my last review on the Harbour Plaza and why I went in search of a new hotel and I am so glad I did.If your a first time visitor to HK I do NOT reccomend you stay here only because I firmly belive there is nothing more spectacular then a Harbour View room in Hong Kong. There is nothing more spectacular then waking up and seeing the busting Victoria Harbour.That said this hotel is perfect for every stay after your first. The service is second to non in all of HK. From the second you arrive to till you leave the staff is there to please.For the first two nights I stayed in a standard room. The room is fine. The only knock is the bed is very firm but not Chinese firm so its livable.The first night I ordered room service. I wasnt that hungry so i ordered an appitizer. The app was HUGE. I couldnt even finish it.The next 3 nights I stayed in an executive suite and I have to tell you that it was one of the best suites I ever stayed in. Nice living room with a full kitchen, (who knew they even existed in HK?!?!?). Awesome shower and bathroom plus fantastic flat screen plazmas in every room (2 in the suites).Wireless internet was a great plus! The added value of breakfast, snacks, and drinks on the exec level club is well worth it. Every morning I had breakfast (made to order eggs!!) on the exec level, followed by afternoon snacks, and night caps. The view from the exec lounge is awesome. Since this is one of the taller hotels in HK you really get a cool birds eye view of the Mong Kok. Not interested in Hotel food, take the enclosed walk way to the Langham Place shopping center (off the lobby) and when you enter the mall you will see at least 10 resturants too choose from plus Starbuck and little gourmet shops. The mall is nice to walk around, plus you can get to the MTR without every having to go outside!!.The hotel is almost 4 years old, but the staff acts like its brand new and try so hard to make sure your stay is as comfortable as possible. I really enjoyed my stay here and looked forward to coming back to my room each day/night. A great example of the service is during my first two nights I stayed in a standard room on the 8 floor, my next 3 nights I was on the 38th floor. The response time to my requests were identical.Oh I almost forgot!! Each room is equipped with the S.M.A.R.T. Phone. In most hotels you have to dial a certain extension to reach a certain department such as room service or bell hop. At the Langham Place, all you do is press 0 (zero) and the person that answers takes care of everything for you from room service, housekeeping, bell hop, resevations, anything. Its having the concierge at your beck and call with the push of one button. You dont realize how awesome that is until you have it.Great hotel, great location, great food, great service...great great great great!!I will not stay anywhere else in HK!!!!

<Content>Should have 6 stars This is the best choice if going to Hong Kong. It is in Kowloon but there is a mtr station across the street which gets you to Hong Kong island in about 10 minutes. The food is amazing and the service is top-notch. The rooms are beautiful and appointed with every detail imaginable. The gym and pool are on the roof top and better than any other I have seen (and I have seen some of the best) Go to the portal restaurant for great burgers, drinks, etc.. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is excellent. Also has a Starbucks in the lobby connection bridge.

<Content>The service at the Langham Place Hotel lives up to all the reviews. From the moment we arrived at the Langham Place hotel at 0730 in the morning the standard of service was set. We were happily granted an early check-in and speedily sent up to our delightful room that had extensive views over the city. The quality of all the fittings and ammenities was excellent and we were able to begin the process of making the most of our 3 night stay in Hong Kong.The hotel staff were very helpful with directions and booking tours. We enjoyed the nearby markets, particularly the goldfish market. The location is great and arrival and departure by train was easy. Overall this was a perfect start to our world trip, due in no small part to the efforts of the hotel and its staff.

<Content>Great Location We arrived on Christmas Day - the first stop of our honeymoon. The hotel is in a great location - Mongkok is fun and busy and gives you a taste of life in Hong Kong. The location is fab - just a few secs walk to the MTR. Buy a Octopus card which you can top up when you need and then get cash back at the end of your stay. We wizzed our way back and forwards from Kowloon to Hong Kong island - it is really easy. Having recently used the tube system in New York and Boston - this is a doddle. We did usual sights - Peak, Big Buddha by cable car, Ocean Park to see the pandas (it is so busy there!!!). We were left a bottle of fizz by the hotel and a Christmas gift. Our room had such a comfy bed - bliss after long haul flight and preparing for the wedding. Great views over hong kong, great bathroom and fanastic service.Perfect for a stay in Hong Kong - no complaints from us!

<Content>Location, location The best thing for us was the location. Mongkok is as Chinese as it gets in Hong Kong. The extensive night market five minutes walk away has far more local shoppers than tourists. Buses and trains are on the doorstep so you can get anywhere else in Hong Kong with ease. Harbourside locations seem sterile by comparison. The hotel itself rates four and a half stars --- the missing half star is the relatively small size of the rooms. But it was very quiet at nights and the air-conditioning was effective. Staff were excellent. A highlight is the rooftop swimming pool and luxurious changing rooms. Don't bother with paying for the hotel breakfast -- there is a Delifrance in the shopping centre next door at a quarter the price. One or two tips. Buy an octopus card at any MTR station (there's one immediately by the hotel) to make it particularly easy to travel around on everything from trains and trams to minibuses and the Star Ferry. Because public transport is so good there is no need for organised excursions --- much more exciting to do it yourself. We recommend Lamma Island (easy ferry ride) for an exhilarating walk between the two main villages. Stanley Market may be touristy, but it does have some great bargains. Aberdeen's high-rise developments have to be seen to be believed and take a sampan trip round its harbour (ignoring the tourist trap floating restaurants). The number 15 bus (which leaves from outside the Star Ferry terminal) is just as spectacular a method of getting up the Peak as the funicular (which often has lengthy queues). If you are there on a Sunday go to Kowloon City Park or Victoria Park for local colour.Do get out into the New Territories, especially to see the walled villages. We found Macau (70 minutes by ferry) very disappointing compared to Hong Kong.

<Content>Fantastic Labgham Place What a great find for our stay in Hong Kong-the hotel offers first class service(s) and is particulary well sited for all the exploration we undertook of the Island. Although the room was relativeley small - this was acceptable as there was only two of us -and the standard of cleanliness and facilities on offer far outshone this 'minor' observation. I would recommend-and have been since my return !- the Langham place as a first rate hotel with super facilities, location, service and best of all, value for money!

<Content>Is O K The room booked were for a family of three, they called them Kowloon Room, which supposed to be a bit bigger than the standard room in the Hotel. I still found it to be small for three peoples.The advertised blissful bed were no better than any other hotel bed, hence firm and not too comfy.The Hotel is O K as a 4 star Hotel with over priced buffet meals and breckfest.The buffet in the morning and dinner times are more or less the same every night and you soon get sick of what's there.I would recommand to sample the local eateria and your money will go a long way.The gym and swimming pool are very good, especially the spa facilities, you will get all the steam room and sauna with in the changing room area and also a hot tub, all in all the spa facilities make the stay a bit special.

<Content>favourite city hotel in the world Love this hotel. It's now my favourite city hotel in the world. Yes, rooms are compact, but they are well-proportioned and have everything you could ask for. Beds are heavenly and the location is wonderful. I love Mong Kok - it's a vibrant and exciting place to explore, but the hotel is very close to the Metro so it is quick and easy to get almost anywhere. I very much hope I will return. I also stayed at the Silvermine Beach Hotel on Lantau which is not this kind of luxury hotel but is also worth staying at as it offers an interesting contrast to the city hotel. It's only a half hour ferry ride and offers easy access to places like the monastery and Tai O (small fishing village).

<Content>Very good hotel - if you want to stay in "Chinese Hong Kong" We, a group of three travellers, stayed in a Suite in the Langham Place Hotel for a week and overall, we had a fantastic experience. The hotel itself is a true 5-star hotel which offers all amenities you would expect from a hotel of such a standard. It is true, that the size of the ROOMS is a bit on the small side, but with respect to the scarcity of space in Hong Kong, this is what we expected. Rooms in upper floors over great views of the city and the harbour, even though only very few rooms seem to have an unobstructed view onto Hong Kong Island.The SERVICE was perfect - all hotel staff went out of their way to make our stay as convenient as possible. What is more, we had a few additional wishes which we voiced prior to our arrival - and everything was settled perfectly when we arrived. I know, this should be the norm, but I also know it isn't...If you can afford it, book a room that grants access to the EXECUTIVE LOUNGE, as the service there was the best I have experienced in such a facility, with free drinks throughout the day and differing (and tasty) snacks that varied according to the daytime. There is also free Internet access on three (a bit slow) computers in a designated area that offers a certain amount of privacy.BREAKFAST is plentiful and offers more than enough variety (English, Continental, Asian), even though those who need their breakfast light and sweet might complain that they have seen larger varieties in other 5-star-hotels.The LOCATION is very good, if you want the Chinese Hong Kong experience (which we did) as the hotel is situated in the center of the bustling Mongkok, which must be the most Chinese area of Hong Kong. The area is always overcrowded with people and a number of different markets are around the corner - very interesting! As the MTR (Hong Kong's adorable public transport system) is literally underneath the hotel, Hong Kong Island is easily accessible by train. Still, if you are looking for a more conservative, business like area, Mongkok might NOT be the place you want to stay in. The one thing the location does not offer, is a good bar (I mean the place to drink, not a restaurant - there are hundreds in the area!) around the corner, as these are somehow crammed into two neighborhoods that are not within walking distance (Hong Kong citizens seem to like their specialists all in the same place, there are streets full of butchers, smiths, florists, dog barbers etc...).All in all, we were very satisfied with the hotel and felt that it offered very good value for money as it is one of the less expensive 5-star-hotels in Hong Kong.

<Content>Good choice in the $US200 range I stayed at the Langham Place hotel in early April, and thought it was a good place to stay if you're looking for something nice and have ~$US200 a night to spend.Rooms are a little small, but that's what you get in Hong Kong unless you spend a lot of money. Our room was very quiet and very clean. Good service, a good food court in the mall next door, and free Internet (for casual users) by the in-house restaurant. Location in Mong Kok looks out of the way on a map, but the subway (MTR) is incredibly convenient to get you around, so location is not a problem.

<Content>A high tech hotel Despite a number of positive reviews here, I was a bit hesitant when I originally decided to book a room, because Mong-Kok is a very busy area and a bit far from the places I needed to go.I took a direct bus (Hotel Shuttle) to the hotel from the airport which took about 40 minutes. We were welcomed by staff at the door and directed to the elevator to the lobby. Check-in was very efficient, and the room was amazing. Although it was not a wide room, they made their best to make the room look much wider than it actually is. Layout of mirrors, furniture, as well as a large window with specutacular view were among them. The bathroom was surrounded not by concrete wall but by glass. There was a phone with various functions. Plus a TVand a DVD player.What I was impressed, however, was the quality of service. Upon check-in, I reserved a shuttle back to the airport , and the night before check-out, there was a written message left under the door reconfirming the schedule. The hotel is connected with the Langham Place shopping mall and Mong Kok MRT station from where you can go to various areas in Hong Kong.

<Content>Let's Not Get Carried Away The positive reviews from Tripadvisor lead us to book this hotel and in general we had a similar positive experience as most people who have placed a review. But I feel a number of the reviews have lacked some balance. Having stayed at a few hotels around the world I can offer the opinion that this is definitely a four star hotel pretending to be five (as sold to us via the British Airways website). On the positive side the health spa, food and staff were all excellent and the hotel is well located for the MTR and shopping in Mongkok. The health spa and facilities are some of the best I have used.Where the hotel is let down (and this is based on an Executive Room) is the room size. The hotel has tried to fit a very large bed (super king or possibly larger) into a room which then barely leaves you space to walk around it. The entrance to the room is simialrly narrow and the bathroom whilst very well appointed (the rain fall shower is excellent) is also on the small side. I know space is at a premium in HK, but if you are going to be ranked at 5 stars then this hotel does not make the grade. Also a number of people have comment about the 42 plasma TV hung off the wall - unfortuantley this is completely out of propotion to the room size.I know it all sound like nit picking - but 5 star should leave no room for criticism.The other thing, and it is somethng which is a bit intangible is that the hotel did not leave us with that 5 star wow impression. Perhaps it was the understated entrance and reception or that things gets lost in translation when speaking to the staff.Overall a very good 4 star hotel and worth a stay - but defintely not a 5.

<Content>Loved the Chuan Spa Centre Langham Place Hotel Mongkok . 2nd April, 2003 . Three women shopping in Hong Kong, we had a ball. I choose the hotel and did my research on this site. We were not disappointed! It was everything we wanted. The location was perfect with the MTR very close the markets. The Hotel being attached to a large shopping centre and food hall. We stayed six nights, were greeted with warm towels to freshen our hands. Our check in did seem to take quite sometime we checked in at 7.30pm but our room was not yet ready? That took about 20 30mins which seemed odd. But our room was perfect, three single beds as requested. That was our only delay. The staff throughout the Hotel were excellent and most helpful. The buffet food was very good and a great start to the day with a very big selection. We enjoyed chatting to the head chef Lorraine nearly everyday as she did a walk through the restaurant. That chocolate fondue for dipping the donuts in was awesome. We enjoyed happy hour in the bar which also included nibbles. Late into the evening we met gigi the Candian singer who was delightful. We enjoyed a treatment in the Chuan day spa, where the staff are so friendly and curteous. The facilities in the sauna area are so nice you will not want to leave.As for the pool the view is amazing! Our room was cleanededspotlessly every day and a comp. water bottle by the bed and slippers. The comp. shampoos etc...were a beautiful quality. All in all I could not speak more highly of this Hotel. The staff and management are to be congratulated on a wonderful team effort. I look forward to returning again and I would recommend this Hotel to any-one.

<Content>Excellent value-for-money We had a blast here, staying in a club room with access to the Club Lounge well worth the extra cost (but still very very reasonable). The lounge provided Bladerunner skyline views, a relaxing living room atmosphere, plentiful complimentary nibbles/drinks and, above all, the most amazing massage chair I have ever used in my entire life. Wow! You must check out that chair! The hotel's Mongkok location made us feel like locals and allowed convenient access to the rest of the city via an MTR station across the street. Food in the hotel lobby restaurant was outstanding on 3 different days. The rooftop pool and sauna facilities are among the best we've used and it was a pleasure to just sit and 'be' in the adjacent Contemplation Room sipping tea afterwards. The staff were always helpful and made us feel very welcome without gettting in our faces. We would stay here again without hesitation.

<Content>Just fantastic From the moment we arrived at reception to be greeted with warm towels after a very long journey from the UK, I knew that this was going to be a very special hotel.The young, attentive staff were just amazing and the attention to detail from the provision of a beautiful birthday cake for my husband to the little slippers placed by our bedside at 'turndown' each evening.The buffet provided at breakfast and dinner was first class. However, as the hotel is adjoined to a brand new shopping mall, there was always alternative eating just a few steps away.This was our first time in Hong Kong and I was a little concerned at being away from the main tourist centre, but should not have worried as the metro system was highly efficient and spotlessly clean. I cannot recommend this hotel too highly.

<Content>A Great Hotel Despite Challenging Location A Great Hotel Despite Challenging LocationI booked a week at the LPH after reading several TripAdvisor reviews. I stayed at LPH over the Chinese New Year Week this February with my family. For tourists willing to brave a very crowded location, this hotel is worth the effort. There is almost too much to cover -- everything at this hotel is first rate: rooms (pretty small), service, food quality, and hospitality. The hotel's reservations department was helpful with rate comparisons, room selection, and transportation options -- even assisting me in planning my itineraries within Hong Kong and China. I wish I'd known that they have a Skype service that allows you to speak direct with the HK reservations office! Finding this hotel is not too easy unless you're familiar with Hong Kong -- even though its is centrally located. If coming by in PM, I'd cab it from the airport. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to an executive room, which is the same as their regular room except on a higher floor. The rooms are small but decked out with the latest technology and the bathrooms are really plush. The rainshowers are awesome but you must remember to pull down the room shade for privacy! My only complaint is that even with all the high tech upgrades, you still have to pay for internet access in your room -- even with an ethernet cable! They do have free PCs/Macs on the 5th floor and Club level.  We sprang for the Club Level service, which was an expensive addition to our bargain rate, but well worth the price, as it included breakfast, snacks/beverages throughout the day. The best feature through was having a large and comfortable place to sit and hang out -- with computer access, TVs, a massage chair-- the works! And the staff there couldn't be nicer! Uncrowded space is at a premium in HK, so this was a real treat. The hotel even opened a private meeting room that had a great view of Victoria Harbor for Club guests to watch the New Year fireworks!The food at all the hotel's restaurants is great, but I thought the best value was at their upscale Ming Court restaurant on the 6th Floor. My 7 year old son particularly liked the chocolate fountains and awesome dessert buffet at The Place. Also, there are about 100 restaurants next door at the Langham Mall! The Chuan Spa is also fantastic -- access to the pool, gym, lounge, and steam/sauna are complimentary, and there is a meditation area for guests to hang out in if you don't go for the Club level. The only drawback of the hotel is its rather overcrowded location in Mong Kok. There are throngs of people everywhere -- but it also puts you within easy access by MTR to everywhere in HK. Overall a great hotel and wonderful experience.

<Content>Mixed Experience I spent the final two (2) days of February '07 at Langham Place. My experience, for the most part, was mixed at best. In other words, some things they seemed to do very well, while regrettably totally missing the mark on others.From a logistics standpoint, getting to the hotel from the airport was relatively straightforward as Langham had a desk just outside the baggage claim area (ie. - In fact there were a bunch of desks for various hotels there!) enabling one to take a chartered bus directly to the property for 130 H.K. dollars one way or approximately $34.00 and change U.S. currency, round trip. Alternatively a fancy private car to the property would've cost 500 H.K. dollars (or $65 U.S.) one way, but was hardly worth the extra money as the bus was quite comfortable and uncrowded, with the trip itself taking approximately 40 minutes.Also, contrary to information from my Hong Kong born and raised co-worker, who advised that the quickest way to Langham Place was by taking the Airport Express (train) to the Kowloon station and hailing a cab from there (ie. - perhaps this would've been a bit cheaper and faster alternative). But the bus, again, was fine. And my co-worker's other horror stories about midday street traffic tie-ups in Hong Kong never materialized either, as traffic was surprisingly free flowing in fact (ie. - Perhaps if I'd arrived during commute hours this wouldn't have been the case; but I can't say).Otherwise, at the hotel itself, service was quite good, in certain respects, as there were always attendants on hand to hail me taxis (ie. - almost NO wait time for taxis, in fact, as they always seemed to be queued up just beyond the hotel's main driveway at all times) and answer questions about walking directions or other activities / sites available for exploration in the immediate area (ie. - Also, as a sidelight, it's worth mentioning that the hotel's main lobby area was two elevator levels above the street level, where taxis and other hotel employees were posted. The hotel was also adjacent to a bustling shopping mall which provided additional challenges in negotiating from the subway train stop - also in the lower levels or recesses of the mall - back to the main lobby).That aside, however, on the flip side, the nature of my interaction orginating from individuals both at the front desk and concierge station appeared rehearsed or scripted and unquestionably very rushed - albiet efficient! - if nothing else. True, they smiled on cue. But there appeared to be lacking a true sense of genuineness or sincerity behind said smiles. Case in point, I went to the concierge for instructions on how to get to Victoria Peak. But everything he told me was so hurried and involved so many points of public transit transfer that I came away feeling more daunted and confused than I did beforehand. When I secondarily asked where to view the laser light show, his responses were no more satisfactory. Essentially, no more information was ever volunteered outside of the specific boundaries of my queries posed - which hearkened back to the whole efficiency, sans (or minus) true concern for guests aura that they convey. It was really transparent to see that he (ie. - the concierge) had gone through this spiel so many times that he was just quickly spouting off all of his standard, rote responses - which is never a good thing.Never ONCE did he mention any tours - Victoria Peak, harbor night cruises to view the laser lights, or otherwise - as potential options for me to consider, which I viewed as pretty inexcusable, actually. But again, you only appeared to get what you asked for and anything beyond that must have evidently been outside of their training scope - which left me feeling somewhat cold and unimpressed in general. As another sidelight, though, I was determined not to be outdone by the initial perfunctory responses received from the concierge, so I revisited him on at least a couple of other occasions - that very same day! - and peppered him with enough questions to finally get him to break out of his facade mode and loosen up to a point wherein I was actually able to extract some useful information from him at long last! Regarding food service, I had decided to take advantage of the breakfast option offered as an addition to the regular room rate. However, dining room service proved to be lacking somewhat, as I had to continually wave at various servers (ie. - and there were many!) floating around the room, to get water refills, for instance. However, the food itself was excellent, featuring both standard American fare as well as Chinese Dim Sum / noodles and other breakfast / luncheon delicacies. The deluxe room I had was a bit on the smaller side (ie. - Perhaps this is common for Hong Kong? But it certainly paled in comparison to the huge rooms in Thailand I'd just stayed in preceding my Hong Kong visit, for lesser cost). Also, I was very disappointed by the level of information provided about all of the various high tech gadgetry in the room (ie. - which would've required a separate orientation session by itself!), as the bellman didn't inform that the power in the room would be disabled if the door's key card wasn't properly placed in the slot just adjacent to the door inside. There was also the electronic touch pad temperature control panel which wasn't explained, nor the button you must push signifying whether you either: 1.) wanted the room cleaned or alternatively wanted the, 2) do not disturb message enabled. Nobody elucidated any of this in advance. The see through glass wall from bedroom to bathroom was acceptable, as I was alone. However, if I'd traveled with a significant other this may (or may not) have been an issue. Furthermore, I had significant problems with the television set, as when I was turning off all of the various light switches in the room - to retire for the evening - one of the switches somehow temporarily shorted out the t.v. - to my dismay. As it was too late to call up anybody, however, I decided to tough it out until the following day. It was at that time that I was only able to get the t.v. up and running again by experimenting with the door key card. Specifically, I removed it from the slot - intentionally turning off all power in the room altogether - and re-inserted it back in the slot (ie. - sort of emulating a trip switch). Upon doing so, the t.v. powered back on. However, afterwards, the t.v.'s pictures kept freezing up periodically, which was also a major annoyance.And oh yes, lest I forget, to add final insult to injury no one informed that the elevators wouldn't work between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. unless you inserted your door key cards in a little slot in the elevator. So the scenario was this. Specifically, it's after 11 p.m. Me and another couple - whom I didn't know - entered the elevator and the door closed behind us as usual. However, when we punched the buttons for our respective floors, nothing happened, and after a few seconds the elevator door opened on its own, having never moved from our floor of entry, at all. After a confused minute or two, way off down in the lower left hand corner of the elevator - in small print - we finally noticed a little placard and card slot instructing us that the elevators wouldn't work between said hours unless we inserted the door cards, into the slot accordingly. Again, wasn't it real nice of Langham Place to share that little tidbit of knowledge with us in advance (ie. - sic)?!On a positive note, however, without any great hassle nor fanfare, whatsoever, the hotel did allow me one extra hour until checkout for greater compatibility with my flight schedule, which was appreciated.Through it all, I'd probably stay at Langham Place again, on a subsequent visit to Hong Kong. I'd probably try upgrading the room, however. But in either event, I'd certainly perform more due diligence in checking around for other alternatives next time, rather than simply accepting all of the glowing reviews I'd read in Trip Advisor as unassailable or the end all gospel word. Because the property still has a road long traveled ahead of itself to achieve true 4 or 5 star status in my humble estimation.

<Content>Really different and quirky We spent 3 nights here and booked a club room which gave access to a lovely lounge with food and drinks, internet access, fab views and a massage chair.The bedroom also had magnificent views over the city and was well equipped with huge flat screen tv, and dvds available to borrow from a library. Toiletries were lovely and there was everything you could need. Breakfast was in the club lounge but you had the free option of buffett breakfast downstairs ( I think they probably had to do this as lounge could get busy) The location is very different as the hotel and attched shopping centre are part of a big development investment in Mongkok - which is a real local area and not the traditional touristy part. The streets outside are brilliant to walk around - a real hive of activity with people making everything in front of you - from rivets to coffins and shoes to bathroom fittings. It is really atmospheric yet so easy to get to the sights by subway which is the best subway I have used anywhere in the world.On arriving at the hotel a girl with shocking pink gloves and a funny hat calls the lift for you! Its little things which are quirky/nice!Only downside ( and its not a huge thing) was that we queued to check in only to be told that we should have gone straight to the club floor to check in. When we got there we had to queue again. The club checkin frequently had people waiting so maybe that is a process which could be improved.All in all a fantastic place which I would recommend. Thanks to Trip Advisor as it was through the recommendations there that I booked it.

<Content>Absolutely a great place to stay My wife and I stayed here for four days in February and both of us absolutly loved it. Everything is clean and new with a very pleasant smell introduced into the public areas by the hotel. Everyone of the staff was pleasant and helpful, including the concierge who was always happy to assist with maps, places to see and restaurant reservations.The hotel is attached to the most wonderful mall (very large)which not only has very modern shops but a very good selection of restaurants. Both are connected to the subway system; making the whole place easily accessable to the rest of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. While the hotel is not situated in the ritzy clean high rise areas of Causeway Bay or Central around the Harbour, it is surrounded by the charming markets and gardens like the Jade, Ladies, Flower and Temple.The room was first rate, very modern and had a wonderful view of Kowloon and Hong Kong harbour to the south. We had a room on the Club floor and it was definitely worth it. Great breakfast and all-day nibbles and drinks and afternoon tea , all in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere with wonderful views of the city.Any time I go back this will again be my hotel of choice.

<Content>Luner New Year at the Langham Place This is an excellent hotel with excellent service in one of the most historic parts of Kowloon. It's going to be my home away from home whenever I visit or work in Hong Kong. The MTR is right downstairs, there's plenty of outside restaurants and shopping inside the connected mall, and even a theater next door if you've got time for a movie.PROS: Convenient to everythingBeautiful rooms, small but efficientFlat screen TVComplimentary tea, coffee, and daily bottled waterRoom serviceWonderful bed and linensInteresting glass bathroomDirect shuttle to and from the airportGreat serviceImmaculateNear all sorts of transportationCONS:The restaurant is okay, and pretty expensiveI did not experience any cranky concierge...rather the opposite. Efficient and attentive. I like that kind of service. For the price, I paid a little of $200 US per day, I felt like I got my money's worth.I recommend this place to anyone who is adventurous and wants to really taste Hong Kong.

<Content>I love this Hotel As a regular Business traveller this is the one Hotel I always look forward to returning to. I have stayed here 3 times and I am returning on Monday again and can't wait. From the lovely rooms with great views to the excellent restaurants and superb food. But the real bonus to this Hotel is the Spa on the top floor. It is beyond excellent and if you do stay please try it as it is excellent value for money. A brilliant brilliant Hotel.

<Content>Pure luxury The Langham Place Hotel in Hong Kong is like every hotel should be.I stayed in one of the Club Suites and the facility for Club guests is certainly worth booking - with snacks and drinks available 24/7 in your own special club area with views over the city and a fantastic massaging chair.I only spent one night but I definitely hope to return and spend a bit more time at this fantastic hotel.The room had great floor to ceiling windows,a bed wider than it was long and a nifty blind in the bathroom that went up electronically to reveal a glass wall affording the luxury of watching tv from the bath.The buffet restaurant is first class with all types of cuisine, friendly service and a chocolate fountain.Definitely worth a stay for a reasonable price and I definitely hope to visit again.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This was our first visit to Hong Kong, a 3 night stopover on our way to Australia. After much deliberation (should we book harbour view hotel / shouldn't we book harbour view hotel) we decided on a non harbour view hotel to fit in with our budget. We decided on the Langham Place Hotel in Mongkok. Before arriving, we were unsure of the area/location of hotel and the style of hotel. We were not at all disappointed. As soon as you arrive at the hotel you will be impressed. We checked in and went straight to the bar which happened to have happy hour at the time. Great food and drink menu selection with seafood counter. Buzzy yet at the same time relaxing environment. The hotel location is fabulous. Right on top of an MTR station with easy connections to travel all over the city. A very easy underground system to use with safe, clean, fast, regular trains. Easy to get anywhere on Kowloon or the Island. The hotel is within very easy walking distance to the famous markets and shopping streets. Speak to concierge (who are excellent and can help with all queries, questions and directions). Regarding the hotel, we had a standard room on 27th floor which we were very pleased with. Very comfortable, great bed and bathroom (with glass walls!!). Good views too. Hotel is attached to large shopping complex (access via reception) which is great for shopping but also has a food hall with menus to suit all. Even if you don't manage a swim, be sure to take a look at the hotel rooftop pool. Enjoy! We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>great hotel Just returned from a trip round asia, stayed at the Langham place for three nights. Lovely hotel, good location, only down side room a little small, however if thats all I can moan about thats good. Good choice at breakfast. In room facilities were good with largish flatscreen tv and dvd player, fantastic shower in the marble bathroom. Bed was so comfey, just what you need after a long flight. Close to the MTR which was easy to use. Eating out was fine as the hotel has a direct access to the shopping centre via a walkway bridge. Quite a few eating places here that are good value for money. The staff were very polite and friendly. Close to the ladies market for some cheap clothes etc.

<Content>Excellent hotel I dont normally post reviews but we stayed in this hotel over Xmas until just before new year and I thought this is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Service was unbeatable, my executive room was first rate and the pool, sauna and other such-like facilities were excellent. I find it hard to find any fault in this hotel, even its excellent location in Mongkok.

<Content>Proof of the Pudding Stayed here for three nights as the first leg of a trip which then went on to Thailand. The hotel itself is impressive. Good rooms, lovely spa, great bar serving very good food and wine and some of that dodgy entertainment in hotels that you only get in HK and Dubai and such like. The issue with this hotel is the location which is in Mongkok, not HK island itself. Mongkok is a very busy residential area with lots of markets. If you are willing to take taxis and get the underground as we were, it is good as a value for money option. The hotel is in a shopping mall so if you're feeling tired and it's too hot to go outside, that is an option. The tube station is in the shopping mall so it's not far to get to the harbour area or onto HK island itself. If I were to return to HK, I wouldn't automatically book into this hotel which is maybe proof of the pudding that it wasn't 'all that'.

<Content>Just gorgeous! Its worth going to stay at the Langham Place just for the desserts! The chocolate fountains and individual portions of gorgeous puddings are 'to die for'! The health spa and pool area on the top of the hotel are perfect and a lovely relaxing experience even if you are on your own.The views over the city are spectacular, especially during a thunderstorm! Staff in the hotel are extremely helpful and the rooms, although small are very comfortable - thankfully the beds are huge.Joined to the hotel by a walkway is a brand new and very beautiful shopping mal and the shoe shops are every girls dream! The Christmas decorations were wonderful, My favourite was the white sparkling princess castle.A wonderful experience.

<Content>The best-valued hotel in Hong Kong This is my third stay at this hotel this year. I used to stay at the JW Marriott every time I'm in Hong Kong. The Marriot is not bad but a bit more pricey. The Langham Place is relatively inexpensive and it offers spotlessly clean rooms and awesome service. I am going to continue to stay there while I'm in Hong Kong.I have a Hong Kong Identity card so I qualify for their Hong Kong resident's discount which makes the deal even sweeter. I don't live in Hong Kong any more but I am finding this hotel my new home in Hong Kong.

<Content>A solid A+! A true modern gem in Hong Kong at a great price - everyone at the hotel from the front desk staff to the maids went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable. Hotel is connected to a great shopping mall with restaurants (Starbucks, Deli France etc) and right on top of the Mong Kok MTR station. Our room (on 30th floor) had a great view, plasma TV, and the bathroom was amazing. Don't miss the roof top pool, the view at night is incredible.Other tips - pick up a local SIM card for your cell phone from 7/11 etc and make calls to the US for ~3 cents a minute - card costs about $10 US

<Content>Loved Langham Place My sister and I traveled to Hong Kong for a cultural experience we will never forget. After reading the ranking on TripAdvisor I decided to book our 9 night stay at the Langham Place Hotel. It was fantastic! There were a few things that were particularly nice: (1) the hotel bar/lounge scene which had great food and drinks which we enjoyed immensely before heading out on the town on our 1st night and many more to follow (2) the cleanliness (3) the location - Mongkok gives one more of a 'local' feel of Hong Kong (4) while on the small side, the beds and pillows were great as was the rain shower, especially after the long flight (5) the fitness facility, we saved our HK$ and skipped the spa but loved the free sauna  gym (6) the hotel staff - unfortunately I came down with bronchitis (too many nights at the bar I suppose) and the front desk arranged for a doctor to come to my room the following morning. For only HK$1500 I received excellent medical care which included all of the prescription drugs. Honestly the only thing I would like to change would be the slow lifts/elevators. Buy an octopus card and travel on the MTR like a pro. It's incredibly easy to get all around HK and much faster than taking a taxi.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, fantastic location! I read so much about this hotel before taking the plunge and booking it. Well the first bad experience was to catch the underground to Mong-Kok (hotel location) with a cranky wife, 2 hungry 3 year old boys  about 60kg of luggage. The underground is about a 6 escalator trips + short walks to the hotel lobby and it does not stick out in your face even when your at the lobby level because you are actually in a shopping mall. Reception were very receptive and offered me a couple of clean nicely rolled face washers to wipe my face down. I was given a room on the 29th floor  unfortunately it was really musky smelling like the carpet had been wet for a while and not dried properly. I thought it would eventually go but it didn't so I called them to which they were happy to move me to another room.That was the last of the negative things about the hotel  location. For the next 5 days we had the time of our lives with the great room, fine view, 42 plasma, DVD, unreal bathroom, comfortable bed, etc..and my personal favourite - The Location. The hotel sits above a shopping mall/eatery as well having markets  shops galore in the surrounding area. We were going out shopping at 10pm for a couple of hours then having a bite to eat before going to bed at around 1-2am (we had a friend babysitting). For good coffee try the place next to the long escalator in the Langham mall. The eatery in the mall also offers good value food as well. We are planning to be back again in 2007 and hopefully we will can appreaciate just as much next time.

<Content>Great Hotel and Service, Good Location Stayed here for 5 nights in Nov/Dec. Used the hotel shuttle from the airport as we had 4 large bags and did not want to use the Express Train and handle the baggage. Room was smaller than expected but did have a great bed with a choice of pillows, great amenities and a wonderful view of Hong Kong. The washroom with glass walls takes a little getting used to but makes the room feel bigger and more contemporary.The service was great. About 3 days after checking in I went down to request another key. I spoke to the same agent who had checked me in and she remembered my name and the room number!On one night I wondered down to the buffet resteraunt to purchase a few crackers as I had an upset stomach. I was immediately given some crackers from the buffet and told not to worry when I offered to pay.As other reviews have stated, the pool and gym area are well maintained, very modern and offer great views of Hong Kong.I really liked the location. Mong Kok is only 2 MTR stops from Kowloon and a good base for any visitor. Wonderful shopping and resteraunts all around. When we were walking around Kowloon we were constantly being bothered with offers for suits etc. You will not find this in Mong Kok as I feel this is where many of the locals eat and shop (vs. the tourists). Make sure to try the Dim Sum resteraunt (on level 3) located in the mall next to the hotel. Some of the best Dim Sum I have ever tried!

<Content>Hi Tech plus comfort The High Tech features are a little daunting at first as is the see through window from the superb bathroom which as well as enabling one to watch TV whilst taking a bath, also exposes the tiolet to anyone in the bedroom!Rooms are rather small but very comfortable and the proximity of the Langham Place Centre a real bonus. Views are not great but I'd certainly stay there again.

<Content>superb hotel There's not much to add that hasn't been said already - this is a great hotel! Our 29th Floor room had a fantastic view. It was very clean and contained everything we needed. The jacuzzi / pool area on the 41st Floor was excellent and was also quiet so you never felt crowded.The location is brilliant, Mong Kok is a joy to walk around: interesting streets, shops and people. The MTR subway station is very close for trains to the main tourist attractions.We also booked some tours through the conceirge with a company called Splendid which I would recommend.

<Content>Wow!! We booked this hotel because our first choice, based on this website, Hotel Nikko was unavailable. Having stayed in the Langham Place I'm glad.Langham Place is in the bustling area of Mongkok. The hotel is attached to a shopping centre which has a food court with an immense variety of food outlets. It is also surrounded by streets full of shops and markets which have an unbelievable atmosphere both during the day and at night.The hotel itself wholeheartedly deserves it's 5* rating. The quality, efficiency and warmth of the staff, from the moment you step out of the taxi is wonderfull. Little touches such as the beautiful scent which greets you when you walk in, to the refreshing towels the staff give you whilst you are checking in make the experience, for someone who doesn't normally book 5* unless the rate is too good to miss.The room we booked was an executive room and we were more than happy with the standard of comfort and cleanliness. The bed was huge and we were offerred a choice of differently scented pillows. Having already read the reviews on the TA website we were well aware that the wall between the ensuite and the main bedroom was made of glass and we found this added to the feeling of space in the room. Besides that if you wanted you could watch the Plasma TV from the bath if you wanted.It was quite hot in Hong Kong when we were there which we were not expecting and so we found that upon returning to the hotel after a long days sightseeing and shopping we needed to refresh and shower. The main thing which impressed us was that when the staff came to turn down the bed in the evening they also completely cleaned and replenished the bathroom and shower area again rather than wait until the next morning.We eat breakfast in the hotel on a couple of mornings and the choice was wide ranging and excellent. I particularly liked the fact that the honey was from a honeycomb. We also spent most evenings in the bar which had an excellent Canadian jazz singer on most nights. The atmosphere was congenial, the choice of drinks good and should you get hungry they had an excellent display of fresh seafood (oysters etc) for you to choose from.All in all I would have to say this hotel has it all. I worried initially that it's location away from the harbour would be inconvenient but the MTR was right on the doorstep and the surrounding streets were lively and vibrant. We will definitely be back.

<Content>Langham Place is THE Place to Stay in Hong Kong First Class Five Star Hotel with terrific contemporary design which manages to avoid the stuffiness of competing Five Star Hotels in HK. Situated in real Hong Kong with hustle and bustle of local Chinese in the surrounding streets. Avoids the rather sterile Central Business District atmosphere of eg Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental.Excellent communications as situated on top of Mongkok MTR giving direct access to Kow;oon waterfront and to Central. Rapid road access to Central on HK island in just ten minutes via Western Tunnel which avoids congestion around middle Harbour Tunnel.Five star service amongst the best I have seen. Unbelievable comfortable beds. Room size absoloutley fine although perhaps not as big as at some five star establishments - but bigger than I expected having seen some comments on this website. Excellent bathrooms with glazed screen providing breathtaking views.Relaxed and buzzing Portal bar full of wealthy Hong Kong Chinese as well as hotel guests. Terrific live Jazz every evening (except Sunday).A great hotel for a businessman wanting to escape from the sterile atmosphere surrounding Mandarin Oriental or Four Seasons and great for wealthier tourists too. Can't receommend it highly enough - I will be back.

<Content>Great!!! Had a lovely stay at the Langham Place during a six day stay.Other reviewers have said what we would like to say. Great location, lovely spa/swimming pool, etc.Slightly put out by the fact that we booked months in advance for an Earlybird rate, to find there were cheaper rates. For the length of stay, I would have appreciated the hotel to have offered the best rate, and been able to amend when we arrived. So don't always think that booking early is the best.But it hasn't put me off the place, and it will definitley be our choice of hotel when we return, which I hope will not be too far away!!!

<Content>Best Hotel Yet We arrived in Hong Kong after a 3 week tour of mainland China following the Silk Road so this hotel was an oasis that allowed us to recuperate before returning home. The rooms were spacious enough (despite what some of the other reviewers have said); the beds were unbelievably comfortable; the see-through wall between the bathroom and the bedroom was a bit disconcerting at first until you realized that you could have a view of Hong Kong at night from the luxurious bath; separate rain shower; everything immaculately clean; quiet despite being located in the bustling heart of street markets in Kowloon; free computer usage at the Portal 24/7. Of the many bests about this hotel, one was the fantastic and varied buffet breakfast delivering anything from poached eggs made by the omelet chef for you (a rarity at a hotel), fresh honey from a honeycomb, home made jams, breads of every variety including gluten free, a chocolate fountain in which you could dunk donuts (kids would love this) -- you get the picture. Another was the well-equipped gym and beautiful rooftop pool located in the Spa area. Try this at night when there are few guests and the ceiling is open to the night air. We didn't try the spa itself but the change rooms, including plunge pool and sauna and wonderful showers, as well as every possible amenity for washing and drying your hair, were quite spectacular.Lastly, the service was excellent, from the front desk clerk to the restaurant staff, from the maids to the spa staff, from the concierge desk to the lovely ladies in pink suits opening doors for you. During our stay, we were fortunate enough to be invited to a manager's cocktail party in a lovely outdoor space behind the breakfast restaurant -- the Backyard. There we got to meet some of the hotel management who made the Langham Place work as seamlessly as it does.We were so happy that we decided to stay in Kowloon. Access to all of Hong Kong's tourist areas was a short and comfortable MTR ride away. Some reviewers complained about the walk to the subway station but either through the Mall or from the outside, it was a short hike. We were lucky enough to encounter a clear morning on Victoria Peak and so got a good view of this lovely City. In the evenings, we trolled the street markets and enjoyed the bargains, especially on the electronics street practically adjacent to the hotel.The shopping mall, attached by a walkway to the hotel, had a variety of restaurants, a Starbucks if you're missing that cappuccino. We particularly enjoyed Genki Sushi, a fast food sushi bar where the sushi plates are delivered to you via conveyer belt and the bill is calculated by totting up the various coloured plates left over.We have stayed at many hotels around the world and the Langham Place is our favourite so far.

<Content>Fantastic Service. Excellant Stay. Beautiful hotel, inter-connected with a shopping mall with a good mix of shops and cafes and restuarants. Also beside the Mong Kok Mtr station so easily accessible from anywhere in Kowloon or Hong Kong island.Rooms a little small but the view is spectacular. Bathroom has everything even a view of the city from the bath. The customer service is top class,extremely friendly and helpful. The gym has an amazing view as does the roof top pool. Have stayed at the Grand Hyatt and the Island Shangri-la and this is on par with both. We were there for 5 nights and will go back again for more.

<Content>Loved it We stayed for six nights in late October. The hotel was great. Rooms, service  food were fantastic. I noticed many complaints regarding getting to the MTR (subway), we found this quite easy. Just go to the ground level, walk across Shanghai Street, through the mall  the MTR is just on the other side. If you take the walkway into the mall from the Lobby level of the hotel it will be painful to get there.It was our first trip to HK and had a tough time deciding whether to stay in Kowloon or on the Island. We were happy with our choice to stay in Kowloon, but next time will probably stay on the Island. Be sure to hit the Mongkok night market, but prices at Stanley market are better.

<Content>Excellent Breakfast Stayed for three nights in the standard rooms. Even though this was a brand new hotel, I thought the decor of the room, especially the bathroom to be quite ugly! Room was small but functional. Air contditionaing was fantastic with an easy to use digital thermostat. A power adapter and ethernet cable is provided free of charge inside the mini-bar. Broadband internet (both wired  wifi) was super-fast but not free. The business center/bar provies about ten terminals to suft the web free of chrage(20 minute time limit). A poster below found the rooms to be noisy and the elevators slow-that was not my experience. No noise from the street or from the hallway, and no problems with the elevators. But I agree that getting to the hotel from the subway station via the mall was frustrating; you have to go up five different escalators. I quickly learned that exiting the station via portland st. and walking around the exterior of the mall to the hotel was much quicker. I had no problems with the location; hotel is just a five minute walk from the northen tip of the temple street night market, and everything else is just quick train ride away with Hong Kong's super efficient subway system.But the highlight of this hotel was the incredible buffet breakfast! Fresh honey from a honeycomb, fresh queezed OJ, and place mats with current news headlines and weather. If the price is right, I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. P.S. If you don't do the hiking trail around the peak, you should have your passport revoked :)

<Content>Top quality hotel with bags of style The Langham Place sets out it's stall as one of the top hotels in the world and certainly pulls it off. We stayed for a few nights en route to Australia and being familiar with most of the top hotels in Hong Kong, we were blown away by this place!It's a hi-tech paradise with IP phones, plasma screens and DVD players - complete with free movies - but you shouldn't overlook the fantastic spa and roof-top swimming pool. Most evenings we had this all to ourselves and felt like kings. A Mongkok location is not the most central but getting around HK is always straightforward and Mongkok is certainly a vibrant place. The adjoining Langham Place Mall is enormous and is like walking through the set of Blade Runner! Food options are plentiful with some excellent restaurants on the top floor of the mall. Surpisingly though, hotel restaurants were good value and the Ming Court in particular is top quality.We took our 10 year old son to this hotel and he was treated very well by all the pleasant staff and our experience was certainly made all the better by the courtesy of everybody who works at the Langham Place.

<Content>Really Quite Overrated I booked this hotel for a short business trip based on the numerous glowing reports from this site. I should make clear that I have been fortunate to stay in some of the finest hotels, but I am equally happy in medium-class hotels if they offer more than the price would lead you to expect. I appreciate that, by HK standards, this is not a particularly expensive hotel, but it really was quite disappointing. There were no huge flaws, just a number of small annoyances which added up to a rather unsatisfactory experience. The most important problem for me was noise. In a hotel of this class, especially a new hotel, you don't expect to be able to hear the TV in the room next door, or the occupants coughing  talking. This is a pet hate of mine, and is just not acceptable. The other guests were also very noisy, and I was woken up on Friday  Saturday nights after 1am by guests returning to their rooms, laughing  talking loudly in the corridors. I know the hotel can't really be held responsbile for this, but that is the kind of clientele it attracts.Next complaint, the location is certainly not ideal. For those who don't know HK, Mongkok is really a bit far out from the action - certainly for tourists. I did know this, but read that the MTR (subway) station was close, and so wasn't concerned. However, whilst the entrance to the MTR is in the shopping mall attached to the hotel, you have to walk right through the mall and down several levels to reach it. This is a good 10-15 minute walk, and so not as handy as you expect. If you want to walk to Tsim Sha Tsui (the part of Kowloon adjacent to HK island, where the 'tourist' area is), you will be walking for more than an hour.The lifts: You will think I am mad, but this hotel has the slowest lifts ever. On accasion, I was waiting for over 5 minutes for a lift to arrive, which is infuriating if you are as impatient as me. I guess there are simply not enough lifts to service the rooms effectively.On the plus side, the rooms are well equipped, with large plasma TVs, and sumptuous bathrooms - the huge rain showers are nearly powerful enough to knock you over. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and they offer a wide range of pillows to ensure you have something to cover up the sound of the other guest arriving back (or just to sleep on perhaps).The Spa is impressive, and they do offer a very nice massage to ease away the aches of the long flight. However, the pool tends to be surrounded by Spa guests on loungers, so you may feel uncomfortable using it if you are a bit self-conscious. The service is also quite good, but I have never found poor service yet in any hotel in this part of the world.I am sure those with different expectations to mine would be happy here, but I recommend you pick a good hotel closer to, or on, the island instead.Simon

<Content>One of my favorite Stay here once or twice a year. Design wise it's fantastic. A really beautiful place with wonderful rooms and a great location in Mongkok. Great for business in Kowloon as your right on top of the MTR. Pretty good shopping center contected directly to the hotel. Lots of local color day and night in surrounding Mongkok. More of the real Hong Kong than you'll see in Central or TST. Service is hit or miss, though overall pretty good. Room service is delicious. Try the cheeseburger or steak sandwich, you won't be disappointed. Always look forward to returning.

<Content>Hong Kong's Best Hotel! Amazing.Arrived by MRT, walked through shopping mall straight into lobby. Were told by reception that we could check-in on the club floor. Wonderful check-in process, all the forms will completed by the hotel staff (I hate those forms!). We were given drinks while we waited.We stayed in the Club Studio Room (which allows access to the club level). View was spectacular, viewing the HKG sprawl from the 37th floor. 42 plasma, dvd, minibar etc. were all pluses. The rooms are decorated in a contemporary luxurious style.The rain shower and whole bathroom were wonderful. Having a Grohe power shower and Grohe rain shower combined makes you want to spend too much time in the shower!A pillow menu is available, offering such delights as lavender and rose scented pillows.The Hotel Club is a very welcome addition. Breakfast, afternoon tea, supper and unlimited free drinks are available. Large plasma screens in all rooms of the club are useful and the massage chair + free Internet completes the package.The roof top pool / Jacuzzi is romantically lit at night and provides a truly amazing way to relax.Did not try the spa or gym, but both looked of the highest standard.Concierge was excellent. When he could not get reservations at Felix, he suggested the newer Aqua, which was very good.Stay here.

<Content>Pretty Decent for what its for.. We stayed for 4 days, honestly the room is only ok when you take a look closely for the detail, might be too high tech feeling for me; very small like those typical HK's apt, but the attached mall is AMAZING, one of the best place to shop local HK designer stuff, and it happened to be the discount time, check the mall if you guys have time, very cheap and good trendy item.

<Content>Fabulous hotel! The hotel is the newer, more beautiful sister to the Langham Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui, and it is connected to a huge mall in Kowloon. While the Tsim Sha Tsui location is more desirable (with top brand name shopping like Gucci, Hermes, Ferragamo, etc) just a stone's throw from the hotel, I liked the Mongkok location better (I have stayed at both) because of the convenience factor. You can get to the metro without ever leaving the building, since it is connected to the mall. There is also an impressive food court in the mall. As for the hotel itself, our room was gorgeous, and there is a pillow menu from which you can choose a scented pillow (even though the regular pillows are great too). The only oddity about the room was that the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom area was made of clear glass (presumably so that you can watch TV while you take a bath), but it really freaked me out. Don't worry, though. There is a shade that you can pull down.The gym and spa are located on a very high floor, so there is a great view of the city and harbor as you are exercising. The spa is expensive (what I would consider top end New York City prices).The service was incredible. Everyone was extremely helpful at the hotel. I would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic!! We stayed here in Sept for 13 nights. Its a fab hotel and we didn't want to leave. We had an early check in- which was no problem. The bedrooms are fantastic, great views over Monk Kok, Huge comfy bed, Huge bathroom with Rain and power Shower, plus bath. you could lie in the bath watching a DVD, sound system in the bathroom. slippers and bath robes were provided daily.The restaurants are amazing, do try the Chinese BBQ- mouth watering. The Spa and pool facilities were excellent, the hot tub is heavenly- the perfect place to relax after a day in the city.All the staff were very pleasant and professional, loved the lift attendants in their Pink suits!Great location, one can access the underground without going outside. The Mall next door was grt for grabbing a quick breakfast.Great hotel, don't know how any other will live up to it!!!!

<Content>WOW! A fantastic hotel! Believe all the good reviews - this hotel is absolutely fabulous. This is a modern hotel with excellent service and high quality facilities.The hotel enabled me to check in straight away with no hassle despite my very early arrival of 8am. They also give me a late check because I had a late flight. On my first night in the hotel they also sent a bottle of wine and chocolates to my room because I was on my honeymoon. The room was beautiful with a spectacular view. The pool and spa facilities are wonderful and the staff couldn鈥檛 help us enough. The hotel is in a great location if you want to shop at the markets, but Mong Kok is a pretty dirty area at ground level. All the shopping malls and hotels are very clean but the actual streets are overcrowded and smelly. I would fully recommend this high class hotel to everyone and in fact it is so good you wouldn鈥檛 want to leave!

<Content>one of the best hotels in the world I stayed in the Langham place hotel for a week with my wife and two children (15 and 13). we had two separate rooms on a highish floor. I'm not sure I can add more than what has been said. rooms are really lovely and luxurious. public rooms are very nice and service from the staff was excellent. we had breakfast every day in the nearby shopping mall which is also amazing. all in all, this is really a terrific hotel. and expedia offered us a really good rate. well worth the money. one drawback of this hotel is that the next hotel you visit can't match it and thus may appear disapointing.

<Content>Discrimination for hotel facilities I booked the room through a Singapore travel agent and when I went there with the children, they did not allow me to use the pool as they said that my room was booked with the travel agent who enjoyed very special rates with them, I had to pay additional HK$80 per pax in order to enjoy the facilities. Thank God that my children were not dressed up to swim yet. I wrote a personal complaint letter to the hotel upon returning home and received a reply from them saying that they have amended this policy and all guests can use their pool now. Too late, I already felt discriminated against.

<Content>Had a wonderful time We stayed for four nights at the end of July and absolutely loved the experience. We arrived about 11am but no problems checking in then. Fantastic view from our room on the 29th floor. We requested and got a non smoking room. touches I really liked - ice making machine on each floor, huge plasma tv with free dvd hire, free internet access from the business centre, friendly staff, great roof top pool - and his and hers showers, steam room and sauna. In fact, when we said we had a late night flight, they let us check out at 1pm but suggested using these facilities and the locker room. This meant we had a relaxing time by the pool, a great shower, changed into fresh clothes before going. Yes, the room wasn't gigantic - but the views from the window and the glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom made it seem more spacious. And there is a blind you can pull down for privacy! I loved where it was located. Great shopping mall for the food court and the more up market retaurants on the higher floors. We had many meals at both. Close to the MTR, and close to some great local markets. Warning - tonic water is very difficult to find. I found one place nearby only. And my husband wanted tomato juice, which on the suggestion of the staff we got in the shopping plaza with international food where the big ships come in. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel  This hotel was wonderful... I cannot believe anyone would have anything negative to say about it. I travel frequently on business and pleasure and this hotel was fantastic! The service was A+. The room (we stayed in the studio) was top notch.The mall connected to the hotel was very convenient and had lots of great food and shopping. The pool on the roof had an impressive view of Hong Kong.For the price this is the place to stay in Kowloon!

<Content>We felt like Royalty!! I just cannot believe that anyone would have anything negative to say about this hotel as it is just beautiful and a true 5*! The staff go out of their way to please you and everywhere you walk, staff smile and wish you 'Good Morning' Even the 'Breakfast staff' in The Place remembered each morning as to whether we preffered tea or coffee and graciously poured it out for us as soon as we sat down to have our breakfast. The Hotel is stunning and immaculate - I am very fussy and I could not fault anything!I have just returned from spending 10 days there with my Husband and 2 children. We stayed in the Kowloon Quad Room and had an excellent deal which included breakfast (Which is amazing - and complete with fruit and chocolate fountains!) The room was spacious and it was a pleasant change that my children did not have to sleep on a Z-Bed but in a 'Blissful' bed of their own! Do not take any toiletries - the hotel provides every single item you will need for your stay - there is also a complimentary umbrella for you to use during your stay. I will not repeat what others have written as readers can scroll down and read about the plasma TV, views, Spa etc but I will just say that all of the mentioned by others exceeded our expectations making if so hard to leave at the end of our stay! Location wise - Mongkok is very exciting! My children are ages 10 and 11 years and did not get bothered by the crowds, but enjoyed watching everyone and looking into restaurants and seeing the hustle and bustle of 'Real' life. We would not stay anywhere else as we had the best of both worlds. We could easily get up to New Territories or down to Central. We liked the location of Mongkok instead of the clinical world of designer shops and high prices. After the 3rd shopping centre, we were bored with the designer shops and shopped in Mongkok where we shopped with the locals which was much more stimulating! (And did not have tourist prices or any tailors nagging you for business everywhere you walked!)Tourist sights - All the usual ones are fantastic but we had our best experiences were with heritage classes, such as Cantonese Opera and Feng Shui classes with the Hong Kong Tourist Board.We cannot wait to stay at Langham Place again and if you are toying with the idea of staying here, I urge you to try this fabulous hotel! You will LOVE it! The Hotel does 'Early Bird Saver Rate' if you book a few months in advance including breakfast!

<Content>good hotel I stayed in langham place in July on a business trip, which was first time as usually stay island side - Purposely booked langham place as its a little out of the way (and would have a little more peace from the usual hordes of colleuges and clients I bump into in other more central hotels!)Itwas a great modern clean hotel, with friendly staff and good facilities - staff were very friendly and were able to fullfill our somewhat fussy room requirements with no fuss straight awaythe bar is really nice, and has atmospherewhich other hotelslack, as its away from the lobbyBreakfasts were good..The only downside is its location, as when the traffic is bad it can take a while toget to / from, that said I would stay again for a leisure trip!Check out can take a whiole, so as to do express check out when you check in!would highly recommend!!only slightword of warning - if you're checking in with other peopleatdifferent time make sure you all book into langham PLACE and not langhams (as mycolleugedid by mistake!!) which is close by too!

<Content>Bad Service, Terrible Decor, and a Mold Problem Have you ever had a friend that has spent a lot of money on an outfit, and the end result is that she/he still appears tacky or tawdry? Well that describes the Langham Place Hotel in Hong Kong to a tee. During our second visit to Hong Kong, we were very enthusiastic about staying at the Langham Place after reading many good reviews. Unfortunately our experience did not live up to our high expectations. The Langham is far from a 5-star hotel. We arrived after a late flight and the first room we were given was small and cramped, the d茅cor was gaudy and worse, it had a serious mold problem. The mold was particularly challenging since my mother has severe allergies and is asthmatic. Because of her health condition we had to switch rooms, but when we asked to be moved to another room we were told there were no other rooms available except for a smoking room or one where we had to upgrade to one of their packages which included brunch, tea, and drinks (none of which we needed because we had many tours scheduled and didn鈥檛 need to eat at the hotel). We were told that this would be the only way we could change rooms, and since the smoking room was out of the question and it was so late at night, we had no choice but to acquiesce. What they neglected to tell us was that we were being moved to a room that was the exact same size (far smaller than the advertised 300+ square feet). The room was uncomfortable - very cluttered with art, glass accents, and an enormous bed that took up most of the room. We were very disappointed by the whole experience. After just one night, we cancelled our reservation and switched hotels (we spent the remainder of our trip comfortably at the less glossy but more tasteful JW Marriott). Though we believe the lobby, bar, and dining area at the Langham Place to be lovely, the two Executive Rooms we encountered were dismal, and we simply did not appreciate having to pay more money for a room that was the same size, and a dining package we never used. Honestly we would have preferred a comfortable room over a room stuffed full of low-end high-tech gadgets. Based on our room, we couldn鈥檛 imagine that this hotel was the very same that had received such glowing reviews! If you are a traveler that spends a great deal of time in hotel bars, lounges and restaurants, and less time in your room, perhaps the Langham Place would be good fit. But if you desire a hotel with a full package, this is not the hotel for you. Overall, I would not recommend Langham Place.

<Content>Lovely hotel but so-so location. My wife and I stayed two nights at the Langham Place Hotel as a stop-over and found the hotel to be delightful. The room was spacious, luxurious and very well appointed, the public areas were excellent and the staff were extremely obliging. Mong Kok is out of the usual tourist area and the surrounding streets are a bit scruffy in places but the hotel is handy to the Temple Street and Ladies' markets, if that's your thing. There is public transport available nearby and the shopping centre attached to the hotel is very stylish.

<Content>An oasis of calm, style and excellent service! I stayed at the Langham Place for 7 nights from June 18th and had a fantastic holiday. Upon arrival the staff were courteous, efficient and welcoming - I stayed with 2 friends and we had booked a triple room but were upgraded to a much larger quad room without having to ask. The hotel is immaculate, the whole hotel has a light fragrance of jasmine - not overpowering but pleasant and the views over Hong Kong island are among the best I have ever experienced.Our room was on the 26th floor and was perfect. The widescreen plasma TV was a real plus as were the speakers in the bathroom enabling you to watch TV or listen to the radio in the bath (assuming nobody else was in the room as the wall of the bathroom is glass with a blind that you can pull down!). The shower was among the most spacious I have seen in hotels with a huge central shower head - the 'rain effect' shower - and a seperate portable shower head. It was an absolute delight! The housekeeping service was flawless and our beds were turned down in the early evening whilst we were out and slippers placed by our bed along with a complimentary bottle of water.The breakfast at 'the place' restaurant was a fantastic buffet mix of Western and Chinese breakfast options, ranging from pancakes to dim sum and was extremely good value for money. The bar was stylish and had jazz performances in the evenings and some delicious cocktails on the menu (I especially liked the Sake lady!). Next to the bar was a work area with free access to the internet from a selection of PCs and Macs; I found this especially useful for emailing friends/colleagues and for reconfirming and online check in for my flights.For me the highlight of the hotel is the Chuan Spa on the 41st floor. The changing rooms are in themselves well designed and every possible need catered for with a sauna, steam room and jaccuzi (which is next to a window overlooking the city in the men's - so relaxing!) as well as provision of all toiletries one could ever need. The pool area was, contrary to the previous review, open throughout my stay and I made use of it both at night and during the day, affording a supremely relaxing experience and an unrivalled view from the open air pool!The langham mall adjacent to the hotel has Starbucks and many other small cafes that we used on days when we felt a lighter breakfast or just an iced coffee was necessary! The MTR (subway/underground) has a station right outside the hotel and is extremely convenient for accessing Kowloon and Hong Kong itself. We felt the location was actually preferable to central HK as the surrounds felt far more authentic and offered a better experience of Hong Kong life.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel - it is certainly the best value 5* (it truely IS a 5* hotel, contrary to other reviews!) hotel I have ever stayed at and I look forward to the day I can go back to Hong Kong as I most certainly will be staying here!

<Content>A fake 5 star hotel I stayed this hotel for 3nights. And I wasn't happy at all with them.Arrived about 9pm, after the long tiring day, to check in the roomtook almost half an hour, I went into the room of 29th floor.Then I unpacked my luggage, went out to eat and came back in the room, open the door of toilet,SURPRISE! they gave me the room for the reduced mobility guest.Too low wash basisn, no separate shower, no rain forest shower, no view of TV,no complete set of soap(they may think reduced mobility person don't use body milk???)....But I was too tired to pack my staff again and change room.So next day, I changed the room. I went into a new room on the 32nd floor, and I smelled a lot of spray-chemical. But by this time I noticed that they are not the real 5 star, so I stopped complaining. To change my mood, I went up to theswimming pool and I found NO SWIMMING sign and I even couldn't reach the pool area.It written because of the storm. But the day of 22th June, there was no storm.Just 10 minutes of shower.... For the person who used to stay in a real 5 star hotel, better evitate this hotel.They want to appeal also design, but except gym/spa area, the lobby, bar, room...nothing design. Just a classic old style with bit more of glasses.Their bar is really cheap. I took my friends on the 5th floor bar, but I felt shame...We ordered just one glass of drink and went out.No good atmosphere, no taste, no style.Also the doorman of the street level was awful. Not polite at all. I took a taxi beside the hotel, to explain where I wanna go, taxi driver didn't undestand english well, but doorman did help me nothing.Other 5 star hotel helped me, even pick the taxi number and gave it to me as a reference.Comparing to the other 5 star hotel, this isn't a real 5 star. At least for the person who travel a lot and know what is the service, this hotel doesn't worth 5 star.

<Content>Heaven! The hotel was perfect, really well looked after and the room was lovely with a good view. Free dvds and internet access were also provided. The weather was quite mixed so direct access to the mall and cinema next door proved very useful! Slightly expensive but i'd definitely stay again.

<Content>Awesome Stayed for three nights at the end of March en route to Perth. We had booked a family room with two double beds and were for some reason upgraded to the Emmasadors Suite on the 40th floor. Room was complete with laundry, kitchen, study, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, plasma t.v's everywhere and simply stunning views.Service could not be faulted and the staff were charming and helpful. Great location for visiting markets and shopping. Although not on the harbour, I would have no hesitation in staying here again. 10/10

<Content>Breathtaking design statement Just returned from a wonderful time at the Langham Place and can't rave enough about it. It was a bold decision to build a very modern, design statement hotel in a non-tourist type environment-but it works! Everything about the hotel spells attention to detail, from the edgy floral arrangements to the wonderful smell of ginger flowers that wafted throughout the public areas ( I bought bottles of the stuff to take home as presents!) The lounge/bar area is jazz cool and if you want to shop upscale or grab a Starbucks there is a multistory, brand new shopping mall attached. Or if you'd rather eat with the locals and shop at the markets, just step outside the front door( Ladies Market is just around the corner). The rooms are Hong Kong small, but very comfortable with plasma screen TV on the wall and a huge rain shower and glass sink in the bathroom. We had three people in our room(husband , son and I ) with one queen and two twin beds and still plenty of room for luggage etc so while small-good utilization of space. This isnt the hotel to stay in if your looking for harbour views but we had a breathtaking view of the city and loved the neon frenzy just outside of the hotel. Mongkok station is attached to the Langham Shopping Mall if you want to use Hong Kong's great public transport system or avail yourself of the inexpensive taxis from the lobby entrance to the hotel. We really enjoyed our time at this hotel and would have no hesitation about recommending it to others.

<Content>A fantastic Hotel, and excellent location The hotel came as a recommendation, and I was a bit apprehensive when I booked it, but it turned out to be a superb hotel. We stayed for 5 nights at the beginning of April.The luggage was taken care of, as soon as we stepped out of the taxi. The lifts were summoned by ladies dressed in pink suits.The receptionists were very polite and helpful, and gave us information on sites to visit.The room wasn't ready so they gave us vouchers for the bar while we waited, which was nice.Not sure what rooms all the others stayed in, but the kowloon suite we had booked for the 2 adults and 2 children was very clean and roomy on the 31st floor.We had inclusive breakfast, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The waiters were fast and efficient in clearing the tables.The best part was the open swimming pool and jacuzzi on the roof-top 42nd floor. Absolutely magnificient as we could virtually see the whole of Hong Kong from the windows and the facilities were first class.The location was perfect for our holiday, as the metro station is right next door and 2 stops to downtown HK, the attached shopping mall was a huge 15 floor complex. The night markets on the doorstep are worth a visit.Overall, the hotel location is perfect, and I could not fault it at all. It was a bit pricey at 拢250 per night for the four of us, including breakfast, but worth it.Extras: they had slippers for us in the room, large LCD television with sky channels and dvd player....

<Content>Wonderful hotel! We stayed at the Langham Place Hotel for 3 nights in April, 2006. It was a divine experience. We were a traveling trio of grandmother, mother and daughter. Upon arrival we were pleased to find 3 twin beds instead of the typical double beds which require sharing. The beds were very comfortable, unlike many of the very hard beds you usually find in Hong Kong. The view from our 32nd floor room was spectacular. We highly recommend the lunch buffet in the dining room. The price is very reasonable, and the selection is amazing! Dozens of entrees and salads, and a full seafood bar. The dessert island includes a chocolate fountain. I didn't expect the chocolate to be very good, but it really was superb tasting chocolate. We also enjoyed the cocktail lounge balcony in the evening. The live entertainment was excellent. The singer was very beautiful, and she had an extraordinary voice.There was a lovely fragrance wafting throughout the hotel. It was light floral and refreshing.The swimming pool and sauna were very nice.All of the wait staff personnel were helpful, gracious, and prompt. The service was definitely A+.My one and only complaint is that the packets of coffee grounds were not free in the rooms. Tea bags and powdered coffee packets were, but if you wanted to make a fresh pot you had to pay an unreasonable price. I thought this was petty, and it irritated me as I have stayed in many inexpensive hotels in the US that have free coffee pot type coffee.

<Content>Congested Room. Congested Area I wanted to stay at the original Langham but it was full, so I thought this sister hotel would be comparable. That proved to be a big assumption. First of all, the Mongkok area is congested and a bit depressing. Ok--I know some people say Mongkok is interesting because this is where the real HongKongers live. But trust me, that doesn't mean you want to stay there. I love Hong Kong and have been there numerous times, so I have nothing against crowds, etc. But Mongkok felt choking with humanity. I stayed in a room that was very small. It was also weird because the bathtub almost butted against the bed (you could pull up the shades by the tub and have a view of your bed--but why would you??). It was a pathetic attempt to be stylish and hip.VJC, New York  Milan

<Content>Good Hotel for a quick visit to Hong Kong We stayed for two nights, 22/23rd March 2006, en route to Australia. Staff are very attentive, rooms are adequate (my wife was not amused by the glass walls surrounding the bathroom, although she did pull the curtains). Excellent location within easy reach of food stalls, markets, transport. Would use it again.

<Content>A great hotel I have been staying at Langham Place for three times in the last 12 months - and I really do love it. The standard Executive Rooms are really small, but I have been upgraded twice - last time to the President Suite (!) - and I think this was a really generous gesture (though I even felt lost with so much space for one person...).The Club level service is really great with foods and beverage supply all day long - and the Mongkok location of the hotel is by far more interesting than Hong Kong Island with all its shopping malls and its typical staple of globally available designer brand shops.Thumbs up for the Langham Place - especially given the price levels of other hotels in this category.

<Content>Good choice in Kowloon We stayed here one night. It was conveniently located, clean, and ready access to a mall. Only thing a little weird was the see-through bathroom. But a good choice and reasonably priced by Hong Kong Standards. Also, the restaurant buffet was outstanding.

<Content>Langham Place Mong Kok I just finished spending eight nights at hotel with decidedly mixed reactions. The positives was a wonderful bed and towels and bath shower which were all excellent. The rooms are small. Breakfast and internet access is not included in very high rate. Worse, there was an odd, rot like smell in my first room and when I was moved to next one it was almost as bad.I lost my wallet while there and it would have been helpful if they had a list of numbers for me to call to get new credit card and report lost ones. There telephone operators were not all that helpful. I also found the concierges not first rate in making reservations.The pool, exercise room and men's shower room were wonderful. The bar is a delight and the music excellent though the service can be cool. I did not like outside barbque on Saturday night.In short not worth the over $300 American dollars a night I spend there. But many friendly people trying very hard and that was wonderful. It is also great it is close to subway and some wonderful shopping night fairs.Honk Kong was magnificent.Macau was great fun and it has one of the most wonderful French restaurants in the world Robuchon at the Hotel Lisboa. Great food and service and beauty. Fantastic wine list.Go to the seaside food restaurants in Sai Kung on a harbor where fresh fist is caught and served at restaurants who make terrific tasting dishes.Back to hotel, I do not think I would stay there again.

<Content>5 star hotel 2 star attitude Good Hotel to start with, but was astonished when they could not accept my visa debit card and instead wanted a credit card..!! Debit card means you have the money in bank and not taking a loan like credit card..!! Had to keep a 1000$ security deposit instead.Excellent room, good service and though staff's are not highly trained but very much co-operative. My hassle was to pay them all bills at the end of the day throughout my 7 days stay, as due to some strange reasons they were unable to believe that I do not carry a credit card, and probably wanted to make sure that I do not catch my flight back to Dubai after seven days with all bills unpaid.I have stayed in Conrad and Peninsula in HK on my earlier visits, and have never faced such a issue.

<Content>Very Good Hotel We stayed at the Langham Place from the 1st to 7th March 2006 and have read lots of the reviews before going and some since my return and offer our impression.Whilst there are lots, the majority of the reviews, are favourable reviews and one recent one here not so favourable, I have to say on balance it was a nice place to stay. I do agree with one of the comments from the previous reviewer and that is the blissful bed. I have not travelled in this region before, but the bed's did seem hard and so different to what we are used to we found them difficult to get a good nights sleep in. At home we have 2000 spring bed of medium firm, and that's blissful! So as I say, this may be the norm for Chinese folk to sleep on much firmer beds. We thought they were too firm, but for those who like firmer beds they will be happy.Enough of the bed. Our experience of the hotel was very good. I asked for an upgrade when I arrived, no suites avalable but they put us in a larger triple room with big corner windows that looked over Mong Kok and down to HK island ( at no extra charge ), on the subject of charges, all things are relative to value paid, we booked through British Airways holidays and the six nights cost 拢345 for the both of us, so comparing money spent, the upgraded room, the view it was excellent value. We added breakfasts, 拢50 for the two of us, 拢50, again through British Airways, this turned out to be good value also as the bill each day for the breakfasts for two was HK$319, about 拢24 X 6 = 拢144. I agree with the previous writer the breakfasts were okay, and I did not think much of the Dim Sum. The breakfasts, they were catering for what you would normaly get in North American style hotels, but not quite as good. In the US they know how to do crispy bacon well, and the potatoes in the morning rather than the hash browns. We are still glad we had it though, plenty of selection. We found the instant we cleared our plates a waiter was there and it was removed. You only needed to usher any of the staff for refills and they delivered right away, and as I say at the price we paid, we have to say excellent value.Whilst on the restaurant, we only ate in it one evening and the selection was not really to our tastes. I know its sounds stupid, but our palates are obviously in tune with western Chinese tastes rather than the genuine chinese that was served in the resuarant so we gave it a miss. However the mall connected has an abundance of local restaurants and these are more in tune with western tastes, so we sampled a few of these. By the way the price difference of the hotel vs the mall eateries is about 90% cheaper than the hotel and about 40% cheaper in other restaurants outside of the mall. There is actually a Mortons restaurant down beside the Pinnisula hotel not far from the Star Ferry, that would be familiar to US visitors if they want a change from chinese food.We found the PC's available in the portel area working fine, with pencils and paper to hand. Connections were good. Don't know about the apple macs though, they didn't get used much, so they might not have been so good, but look impressive.Also at the portel you can borrow dvd's free of charge. Connected to the portel is the bar area, staff very good and don't leave dirty ashtrays on tables, replaced very quickly.Cleanliness is high. Our bathroom washed out each day and you could smell the disinfectant used in cleaning the bathroom. Beds turned down, and curtains pulled every evening. Our room didn't have one of those glass bathrooms but a solid wall one seperate to the bed room. It was a good size and the shower room was very good. Air Con didnt seem to get any warmer or colder whether it was at 18c or 26c. I would notice the difference in my house if I turned the central heating upto 26c, so I don't know, it met our needs anyway.Its pool on the top floor is superb as is the faclities that go with it like the changing rooms, showers, sauna, steam room, jacuzza, toiletries, hairdryers etc etc, all constanly with attendants and again, ensuring used towels are not lying around and cleaning the mirrors and everything else. Everytime we went to the pool it was hardly ever used, often we were the only people there. I had forgot my swimming trunks and had to buy a pair at the pool. Oh well it, could have been worse, I could have forgot my passportAll staff were very help full and the place was spotlessly clean wherever you went.A bit about the Location. Langham Place is slap bang in the middle of Mong Kok. Mong Kok, (meaning burstling corner) is certainly burstling. You step out the hotel through the mall and you are there. Or go the other way and you are right beside street markets of vegtables, fish and meat sellers, wonderful to see and experience and just mingle about taking it all in and taking photo's of the going on's. Other markets are right by you, like 5 minute walk to ladies market or Nathan Road or electronics street or sports street and of course the MTR Mong Kok station is there for easy access to TST or HK island itself. We bought a Octupus ticket from the MTR, HK$150 each (HK$300 in total), run about every where with it trains, buses, ferries, handed it back at the end and got HK$160 back. The whole area is safe and surprising clean for such a huge population and concentration of people (much cleaner say than London), like no cigarette ends or discarded paper or packaging on the roads or pavements, mainly because there are waste bins and ashtrays every few hunderd yards and the locals use them, so did we. If you are observant you will see the the equivalent of the cleansing department steam cleaning the alleyways with portable generators. Another thing was construction sites, vehicles leaving the site to go onto public roads roads having there tyres cleaned first so as not to soil the road.We are glad we stayed on the Kowloon side rather than HK island itself. Visiing HK island it was a bit going to a financial district down town ish if you know what I mean. Lots of designer shops, but you get these every where and if you are familiar with downtown financial districs, unless you are on business, are a bit soulless. Anyway the best veiws, for what HK is famous for, its skyline is best seen looking over from Kowloon and not on HK island.So in summary, the hotel is good, the location to experience the local buzz and everyday life can't be bettered, there are other hotels, but not with such a good location for everything being on your door step. For the cost of the deal through BA, it was excellent value for money, which is the final judgement and it certainly provide good value in my experience.

<Content>As Superficial as a Hollywood Set Having stayed six nights at the Langham Place there is a huge disconnect between my impressions of this property and the praises sung by some of the comments listed by others on this site. The hotel in my estimation is all style and no substance. In fact, it reminds me of a Hollywood set. Once you go beyond the surface, it becomes apparent that the hotel is very ordinary and average in many ways and not deserving of anything more than 3 to 4 stars. 5 stars鈥mpossible!I break my impressions into the tangible qualities of the hotel and the intangible qualities related to service level. First, with the tangibles: I booked two rooms for my stay, one an executive room for my children and the other a studio room. The executive rooms are tiny even by HK standards. I鈥檝e stayed at every major Hong Kong hotel over the years and the only other hotel with smaller rooms is the Kowloon Hotel in TST. If you are traveling as a couple and are big boned westerners you are going to be bumping into things in the executive room. The smallness of the rooms also contributes to the deterioration that is evident in the bump and scratch that results from moving luggage that is inevitable due to space restrictions. There is limited storage space and tiny closets to house your clothes and I found we had to live out of our suitcases. The quality of the furnishings are all sizzle and no steak. All of the casework (cabinetry) are cheaply made, hollow core doors, the drawers are melamine interiors vs. real wood found in other hotels. Plus, the amount of drawerspace is limited. The carpeting reminds me of giraffe skin and feels like cheap office-commercial carpeting underfoot. The 鈥渂lissful鈥?bed is the biggest marketing hype ever, if you like your beds firm, it鈥檚 like sleeping on a slab. The large flat screen TV is a plus, but it鈥檚 there for the hotel鈥檚 benefit, there is no way they can shoehorn an armoire into the room so they put the flat screen on the wall to save space. The bathrooms look nice but is not all that functional and as with the room, is compact. The shower has no light so you shower in the dark, the marble is cheap looking white marble (the kind you see in mainland hotels in abundance), and the glass sink with countertop is an example of gee-wizz design that compromises on functionality. The counter is so small that I found our things constantly falling off it onto the floor. Look closer at the bath hardware and it鈥檚 already starting to tarnish, blister or rusted. Look at the tile grout and it鈥檚 discolored. This is not what you would expect for a so called 5 star property and one that is barely a year old. Water pressure is fine so no faults there. Desk amenities are minimal, a pad with one sheet of paper left to it, and dog-eared and stained hotel brochures and magazines. The common spaces in the hotel is where the owners put all the money. The lobbies, elevators and entry are all very nicely decorated using expensive finishes. The original art is also quite nice to look at. The tradeoff is a richer look in the common areas at the expense of the rooms. Restaurants and Bars 鈥?we ate the buffet breakfast at the Place. The buffet is nothing to write home about. Very ordinary by HK standards. The dim-sum selections barely edible. Service was chaotic. I observed many people running around in frenzied activity but they would pass us up ten times with dirty plates piling up on the table. I had to ask for coffee refills every time even though the coffee lady walked by us a dozen times. Kind of reminded me of an episode of the keystone cops, a lot of activity but none of it actually orchestrated in a meaningful way. I wanted to write a comment to the manager of the service in the buffet, but when I pulled out the comment card that was attached to the payment bill I found it was an older one already filled out by another customer dated several months earlier. I was astonished to find that the staff does little to read or process customer comment cards! After two breakfasts in the hotel, we decamped for the eateries in the adjoining shopping mall. Management needs to work on this. Had evening drinks upstars in the lounge. Very good house band with nice vocals by a stylish and attractive singer. Drinks service was very attentive and prices similar to other HK hotels. The lounge is not big by HK standards and overlooks the lobby.The computer area (Portal) is also not very well managed. At any given time, several PC鈥檚 not operating, broken or frozen. They need to manage this better and make sure the PC鈥檚 are continually serviced. No pads or pencils near the PC鈥檚 as a convenience to guests. Intangibles 鈥?Overall, service was impersonal if not indifferent. High points go to excellent Concierge staff, and very efficient and friendly bell-door staff. Front desk check in was OK and business like. One word of advice, the hotel does not do a good job at maintaining commitments. I had reserved my rooms far in advance and secured with credit card. Upon arrival they told me all rooms in my category were sold out and instead of correcting this, they downgraded me to a superior room and expected me to be satisfied with that. After some more complaining, I corrected this the next day when some executive rooms opened up. Again, this is an example of poor service quality on behalf of the reception desk. One of the days got colder in Hong Kong and the hotel didn鈥檛 turn on the heat. I turned up the room thermostat but it had no effect, the room got cold in the evening. Even in the hotel restaurant, I noticed the waiter had a watery nose due to the cold. Another example of the hotel鈥檚 failure to put the guests comfort first. What I鈥檝e just presented is an unvarnished view of this property as a result of my experience and observations. There are better hotels in Kowloon and HK in this price class. You will find much larger rooms and nicer properties in the Intercontinental HK, Intercontinental Grand Stanford, Sheraton Nathan Road, the Shangri-La or Harbour Plaza for rates that are similar or slightly more. Only thing the place has going for it is the relatively low room rates so for the budget minded traveler who won鈥檛 spend a lot of time in the room, the Langham Place would be fine bearing in mind this is not a true 5 star hotel when compared to some of HK鈥檚 great hotels. Location is a big negative, Tsim Sha Tsui or Central are much better location for the visitor-tourist. Mong-Kok is still rough around the edges. Not a lot of user-friendly (English speaking) restaurants in the neighborhood, you have to explore Central for dining options. Not worth the added travel and hassle to and from Mong Kok. Bottom line, would I return to the Langham Place for a repeat visit? Probably not.

<Content>fabulous hotel in wonderful location This hotel is a must do. It is so fabuously close to all attractions and, with the fantastic MTR station literally next door, you can be in Central Hong Kong in a matter of minutes.The rooms offer amazing views over Kowloon and across to HK island. I would highly recommend the rooms with bath views - a great way to relax after a hectic day sightseeing.The area is lovely and safe / welcoming. I have never felt so safe and at home in any city before.The service is excellent - the hotel (unprompted) even gave me a birthday cake! A lovely surprise to end a fabulous week in an amazing city. Watch out New York - Hong Kong has it all!

<Content>Looking Forward to a Return Visit Very nice hotel attached to an awesome shopping mall. Also just 3 blocks to the Ladies Market street shopping area. There is a subway station inside the mall, so getting around to anyplace is very easy.The room was a little small, but heh, this is Hong Kong! The 42-inch plasma TV and JBL speakers were really nice. We watched the Superbowl live which was great, except that our team lost. The TV channel selection is very good as well.We ate in the food court a few times in the attached mall and also twice at a great Chinese restaurant in the mall.The checkin and checkout staff was fast, the business center people were nice (they let you borrow DVDs to play on the built-in player in each room) and the concierge was very helpful.Don't miss the Po Lin monestary and Big Budda on your trip to Hong Kong -- a very cool experience.

<Content>Fantastic Value For Money We booked this hotel because we got a great rate through BA when booking the flights.The hotel was great, service was fantastic. I had pre-ordered a bottle of wine for the room for my boyfriends 30th birthday, and a wonderful birthday cake was waiting for us in the room compliments of the hotel. The free drink on arrival was also a nice touch. It was Chinese New Year during our stay, and we were left Lai See packets, with chocoalte and biscuits in our room.We had the breakfast buffet a couple of times which had an exellent choice of both Chinese and international food, and ate there for dinner one night when the restaurant we wanted was full. Evening buffet was not as good as breakfast, and much more expensive, but still very good choice of food.It is only 15 minutes from Central by MTR, which we took mostly, (only used taxis to get to the Airport Express Station), as it was so cheap and efficient - even on the night of the New Year fireworks it only took us half an hour to get back, despite the thousands of people trying to do the same! The area around the hotel is authentically Chinese, which we loved, and we always felt safe as there were so many people around, even at night (due to the markets being open so late). It is only two minutes from Ladies Market, with so many bargains!I have only one complaint - check out was painfully slow, and had we used express checkout would have missed the 3 extra breakfasts someone had tried to book to our room!

<Content>Exceeded expectation. Our family of five stayed for 1 night during a Hong Kong stopover. We couldn't fault the beautiful rooms , the very attentive staff and the location. Attached to an enormous shopping centre and 1 block away from a terrific tourist market we all agreed we wouldnt stay anywhere else. Having a transport desk located at the airport made for easy transfer to the hotel for weary travellers. And the BEDS!!!! Your choice of three types of pillows. No problems with jet lag.

<Content>Langham Place and HK Disney My husband, 2 year old son and I just spent 5 days in Hong Kong from 21 to 25th of January. Langham Place Hotel, Mongkok: Not to be confused with Langham Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui. We stayed 3 nights. It was conveniently located next to a train station. Although, if you are going on a short trip like us, it would have been better to stay in Tsim Sha Tsui, Causeway Bay or Hong Kong Central because the train trips do take up precious time. The hotel ambience is 5 stars but there are a few little annoyances which marred my impression. Toiletries were missing when we got there and not replenished daily. The cups were not cleaned properly after use. The desk was missing a lamp. The breakfast buffet ends far too early. 10am sharp. Tip- Don't pay for internet access in your room. Just use the free computers at THE PORTAL where you can borrow free dvds too. The other plus point is the free cot we got for our toddler.Hong Kong Disneyland: Best for kids under 8. Nothing much to offer teens and adults. Best to visit during cold season. Crowds were huge when we were there. Even on a weekday. Long queues. Watch out for unapologetic queue cutters. The Chinese Restaurant called Plaza Inn is yummy. Try the roast goose, soy chicken and sweetsour pork. The park was clean. Staff were polite but some ride attendants seemed jaded (already?!). Very disappointing that the park closed at 7pm on weekdays.We stayed one night at the HK Disneyland Hotel. Beautiful grounds. Good service. Sadly, many guests do not adhere to no smoking rule in common places. The kid's room service is good value. Fire alarm went off at 130am. It was disconcerting to see how unprepared the staff were in managing the event. Thankfully there was no real fire. Breakfast buffet was expensive but you have mickey, minnie, pluto, goofy walking around. Lotsa of photo opportunities. Tip: don't waste your time shopping in the park. The hotel shop has all the same things.

<Content>Great place to be I was there for a short 2 nights weekend break early November last year.Booked by the largest german tour operator.My booking was upgraded to a higher level business room, that means a larger room, newspaper every morning.You leave the hotel and stand in the middle of the bustling activity not far from the next MTR-stationsurrounded by shops.A recommendable hotel at all.

<Content>Best Hotel in HK?! We managed to get a storming deal with BA Holidays after reading the rave reviews on this website. Everything about the hotel was excellent - from staff and service to location and furnishings. I have actively recommended this hotel to everyone I talk to and can't wait to return.If you can, get an executive room with access to the lounge - SO civilised. Also, use the top floor open air pool, and maybe try a massage - quite reasonable by UK prices.This is my first review on TA - because this hotel/staff thoroughly deserves the recognition.

<Content>Smells amazing I would have to agree with all the positive things that were said in the previous reviews. My favorite part was the incredible smell. Everytime you walk into the lobby, the aroma just surrounds you. So, we had to ask the hotel how they do it. It turns out that they actually bottle it up and sell it. It's called Ginger flower oil and I brought 5 bottles home. Now my own home also has the incredible smell and it reminds me of the wonderful time we had in Hong Kong everytime. And try to get a reservation at Aqua restaurant. Pricey, but the view is incredible.

<Content>A Great Hotel- Can't wait to go back. I stayed at the Langham with a friend in November and it was a truly great experience. We had a twin executive room that had the most spectacular views. The rooms are well appointed and extremely comfortable. We received outstanding service during our 5 night stay, the staff at reception and particularly concierge provided excellent advice and were attentive and friendly. The hotel has the most amazing gym, pool and spa areas, I only wish we had more time to take advantage of these facilities. We did however manage to visit the lounge bar, one floor above reception, and enjoyed the happy hour 2 for 1 drinks and live music. The hotel is connected to a shopping complex and we found this convenient when we wanted a quick breakfast at Delifrance or Starbucks. Mongkok is an excellent location, it has the ladies market, great shopping, and good local restaurants. The MRT and KCR stations are a short walk from the hotel and the cheapest and easiest way to get around. I would recommend the Langham to anyone looking for value for money, location and service, it is a great hotel.

<Content>When can I return? This hotel has it all: friendly service, stylish rooms, easy access to the rest of the city; lots of shopping; knowledgable concierge staff; chic bar with live entertainment. The place is easy. Very friendly with no hassles. The breakfast buffet is situated in an elegant, tiered room and offers a large variety of chinese, japanese and western foods. You can have dim sum, freshly prepared omelets, a variety of very fresh pastries and fruits, miso soup, smoked salmon. It goes on and on. Step outside and you're in the middle of Chinese Hong Kong (Kowloon). Next door you can purchase Armani or Gucci and two blocks away you're in an open air clothing market. (Beautiful silk robes and jackets for about $25, jeweled clutches for $10. etc) Next door, under the mall, is the ultra modern subway. Two or three stops and you're most anywhere. The rooms are international modern, but small. The layout and mirrors make it seem larger, but if you and yours are large people, you might check out a suite. Otherwise they are very comfortable. Huge plasma screen on the wall. Space age bathroom. Real nice package. Enjoy.

<Content>We loved it at Langham Place!!! I found Langham Place through Tripadvisor and the reviews do not lie!!! This is a gorgeous hotel (5 stars). I had booked this hotel through directrooms.com so I got a pretty good deal for it. The rooms are gorgeous. There is a shower and a tub in the bathroom, a very plush and comfy King sized bed and a huge flatscreen TV. This hotel by far has a large hotel room especially by HK standards. The service is impeccable and the hotel staff is very friendly!! We also loved the perks there such as the free internet service and dvd rentals. The best part of the hotel was that it was attached to a pretty big mall with a starbucks, foodcourt, lots of restaurants and a ton of shops. The MTR is also just just a few steps away right underneath the mall.We highly recommend this place and would definitely go back!!!

<Content>Joined the majority of the crowd here I stayed here for 2 nights last month for wedding anniversary. I agree with all the raves about this hotel. Excellent service and ambience, nice and trendy room, and great location. I'm glad that I pick this location as I find the other part of Kowloon such as Tsim Tsa Hui a bit touristry for my taste and I find Mongkok to be excellent as I can get local eateries and night market within walking distance. My husband and I also love the rooftop swimming pool, the fitness and locker, and we loved the spa treatment as well (though the spa price is not cheap, it's similar than one in US). Definitely will stay here again if I visit Hong Kong again.

<Content>Excellent place to stay We have just spent 7 nights at this hotel. Rooms are not the biggest but apart from that the place is difficult to fault. We took two Executive rooms as we had our two kids with us. they loved the big Plasma screen and being able to watch it from the bath!The breakfast is excellent. The chocolate fountain was a hit with the kids for sure. If you do not take breakfast then just walk accross the connection to the mall and pick up some treats there.The hotel may not be in the center of the action but it is certainly in the center of Mong Kok which is great for wondering around in the evening.The pool is great and has a wonderful view. The Jacuzzi is very hot and it a great place to relax.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel in 'Chinatown' My fiance and I stayed at the Langham Place for 3 nights in April this year en route to Australia. The hotel was only open 2 months when I discovered it so there were few reviews to go on at the time, but the whole concept of the integrated hotel, office building and a shopping centre with 300+ shops in an authentic area of Hong Kong sounded intriguing, so I wanted to experience first hand for myself. We got a great deal too at 鈧?20 per room per night!We took the hotel bus from the airport to the hotel (only 鈧?2 each, one-way) and were greeted by several doormen and taken upstairs to the large reception area, which looks just like it did in the pictures - lots of mirrors, flowers and dark woods. There was a pianist and singer in the bar upstairs and you could hear them in reception - so first impressions were very good. The room was gorgeous - very comfy king bed, softest sheets, plasma screen  dvd, marble bathroom with seperate glass shower and contemporary furnished. I took a couple of dips in the bath and was nice to relax and watch the tv from the bath! And the view - couldn't have asked for anything better. We were only in a standard room (well that's what we booked anyway!) on the 18th floor but we'd views back towards the city, glimpses of the sea through buildings and below was the curved roof of the shopping centre. Especially pretty view at night.We arrived from London in the evening and we were pretty tired from the flight so we ended up eating in the hotel restaurant the first night and I had my first experience of many with chopsticks! I didn't want to be awkward and ask for cutlery so I just got stuck in! Food was fantastic, very pleasant staff and calm atmosphere - prices very reasonable for a hotel restaurant too (only 鈧?0 for 2 starters, 2 main courses, glass of wine and a beer!).The hotel is only a couple of minutes walk from Mongkok MTR station or Nathan Road and lots of buses but it is about 3km to the Star Ferry for example, at the southern tip of Kowloon. Although we walked from Kowloon a couple of times the hotel's location is a bit far for a 1 or 2 night stay or if you want to be in walking distance of everything. The area around the hotel is full of culture - and you actually feel like you're in China, rather than another big Asian/Westernised city, so I would say the hotel is luxury surrounded by culture.When we booked the pool was supposed to open in early April (we arrived 9th) but unfortunately it wasn't open and looked like it would still be a while due to set backs on sealing the pool. That was very disappointing but most of us know only too well construction rarely goes to plan. The spa looked heaven but we were saving for a Balinese massage in Bali!Free internet access in the hotel was very handy as we were able to send emails  webtexts home to say we arrived on the first leg of our journey safely and rub in how the great the place was! There is also a facility to borrow dvds free of charge.We didn't opt for breakfast but as some other reviewers mentioned there is a delifrance and another very good cafe on the otherside of the glass walkway that connects the hotel and shopping centre. You can even eat out on the balcony and look down on the activity below. Oh I should also mention our leaving experience! We only had a few HK$ left so rather than change some money we decided to experience a bit of local life and take one of the many buses (I've never seen so many buses in the one place anywhere in the world before!) back to the airport. The concierge offered to help us bring our bags to the bus stop!!! It was such a kind offer but we would have felt so stupid arriving at the bus stop with the suited out doorman that we gratefully declined - but it just showed how good the staff were. The concierge also advised on a very good local restaurant and our return airport bus!I would undoubtably stay here again, although as I said for a very short stay, you may prefer to be in a more convenient location in Tsim Sha Tsui or on Hong Kong Island.

<Content>Affordable Five Star Hotel My wife and I stayed at the Langham in mid-October, 2005, so that I could attend the Hong Kong Electronics Fair. Due to the influx of visitors caused by the show, many hotels were booked and had jacked up their prices. We were able to stay at the Langham for an average of $250 per night, including taxes, which is an unbelievable deal for a hotel of this class.We had no problems with the room, the breakfast buffet, check-in/check-out, etc. An interesting feature is the 4th floor connection to the massive (12 story) Langham Place Mall which is across the street. This impressive shopping and restaurant mall has fascinating architecture, and a wide range of shops and eateries.Mong Kok is a little rough, probably known more for where the Hong Kong residents shop that a touristy place. There are apparently Saunas in the area where mischief takes place, but the streets feel relatively safe, and the MTR (subway) is located virtually in the basement of the adjacent mall.While not quite as convenient as the waterfront area of Kowloon, and without the famous view of the Hong Kong skyline, it's a tremendous value for a 4.5 star hotel. It's also close to the Mong Kok KCR (train) station, with easy access to the New Territories and Shenzhen.Susan and I highly recommend the Langham Place as an alternative to the conventional HK and Kowloon hotels.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel, great position My husband and I stayed at the Langham Place in Mongkok 23 Sept for 4 nights. I was a bit hesitant at being in Mongkok but am now convinced it is the best place to stay. It is one small block down from Nathan Rd. The rooms are a touch small but that is usual for HK and was quite manageable. The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. We were actually upgraded to a suite as our window started leaking water (leftover from the heavy typhoon). If you would prefer not to pay for a full breakfast, try the Delifrance literally next door to the hotel, through the overhead pass. The breakfasts are cheap and the baguettes always amazing. For those Aussies, don't forget to pack your vegemite! The hotel's internet facilities were brilliant. They have 8 computers, a mixture of mac and pc all high speed and free to use any time. The adjacent shopping centre (Langham) is fantastic. If you are looking for young, hip original designers go to the ozone and spiral levels, very inexpensive. Go and look at Muji there, is fantastic. The food court is also good at the bottom of Langham shopping centre, good sushi, etc.

<Content>A wonderful experience! My fiancee and I stayed at the Langham Place Hotel in the vibrant part of Hong Kong called Mongkok. We stayed at the end of June-beginning of July which is part of the low season in Hong Kong. The hotel is brand new and a more or less integrated part of a huge new shopping complex (connected to it by an airbridge). The shopping mall itself is pretty cool with twisted walkpaths and very different than an average shopping mall. Mongkok is great! I had been there once earlier but not for more than a few hours making it hard to notice anything else than how busy it was. This time I had more time and it really is a very exciting and alive place! Lot's of food and lots of shops, and lots and lots of people! :) A few famous markets here as well! The temple street market is just outside the hotel - so is the Metro Subway so it's very convenient! The shopping mall has several cinemas and an abundance of restaurants (although we prefered to eat at the hotel or in the street restaurants)The hotel had a mouthwatering chocolate buffet! :)The hotel itself was such a great experience! I've travelled extensively all over the world and this is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in for the price (it was low season). Since we are young people and very interested in Fitness I was suprised to find a fully equipped gym on the top floor, complete with a well educated english speaking personal trainer (free) and view over the entire hong kong. The gym was more hitech and better equipped than the small gym I use at home in Denmark. The top floor also has a spa facility where I had a fantastic 60min massage preparing me for the long flight home. They also serve free tea here in the lounge.Since we stayed in a suite on the club floor it's hard to say how the standard rooms are. I would imagine they are more spacious than other Hong Kong hotels (usually shoebox size). The older Eaton hotel by the same group has good sized standard rooms.We had booked the Junior suite but got upgraded to the Langham Suite upon arrival. This was one of the top 5 floors with amazing views from top to floor windows, a full kitchen (And I mean really there was everything, oven, microwave etc). The kitchen was very modern and all in stainless steal. We had two 42 plasma screens, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. The bathroom was huge with a seperate shower cabin and seperate bathtub. A huge glass wall seperate the bedroom from the bathroom which is quite fun. Obviously there's a button you can press and an automatic white wall comes down so you have privacy. It has to be seen. The club lounge has full breakfast and snack for lunch and dinner. We easily got full on the snacks which are pretty much a meal. They had great chocolate cookies :) . Service was flawless. We went out one day and asked for a champagne cooler and glasses to be put up after 2 hours exact. When we came back from the winestore (often cheaper than the supermarket for champagne) the cooler was ready and full of ice. So we cooked a nice dinner ourselves and set a table up next to the huge window, put on a cd on the all room music system, dimmed the lights and had dinner and champagne with the greatest view in Hong Kong. The club lounge have a free selection of new DVD movies and cds that you can borrow to the room. We had a fantastic stay and we are diffinitely coming back! Also happily in a non suite room! ;)
