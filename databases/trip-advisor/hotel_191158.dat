<Content>Check out the Cooking Classes!! Great Location...and Awesome Cooking Classes..in the Hotel!!We had a lovely time at the Helvetia and Bristol Hotel in Florence. The hotel is in a perfect location - 2 blocks from the Duomo and central to the train station and great shopping.The conciege also was an excellent souce of recommendations. One of the best things we discovered abou this hotel was that it offered SUPERB cooking classes with its awesome hotel Chef in the incredible kitchen of the hotel itself. The Chef's name is Enzo Pette and he was marvelous!! Patient, professional and an awesome cook!! Classes can be 1 afternoon or morning or up to 3 days!! We spent an afternoon in Enzo's kitchen and for 3 hours made and cooked 3 pastas, a beautiful potoato pie starter and a gorgeous dessert finally! Not the hotel if you are looking for nightlife. But a lovely, quiet old hotel with a perfect location and a delicous restaurant.

<Content>Great hotel in every respect! We recently stayed here for a few days as part of our honeymoon through Italy. The location could not be more perfect- just steps from Florence's best shopping and restaurants. The hotel staff were amazing- extremely helpful and courteous. We had a car and it was 40 Euro a day to park- cheaper than in Milan. The hotel is beautifully decorated and quiet. The windows close completely with wooden shutters as well as heavy drapes, thus blocking out all light. The bathroom was very nice and our room was very well decorated. Again, the location just can't be beat- everything worth seeing in Florence is within walking distance. Find a good rate and enjoy!! I would definitely want to stay here again on our next Italian adventure!

<Content>Great spot in the heart of Florence The Bristol  Helvetia hotel is a couple of blocks from the central train station and two blocks from the Duomo. The hotel is clean, inviting and comfortable, the staff is very helpful and the rooms are better than average size, clean and with nice amenities. All in all, this a great spot from which to tour the city and all of the sights. My only markdown is the usual high price of internet access.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Florence, Italy: Helvetia  Bristol HotelDates: August 17, 2008 - August 21, 2008Reviewer: From San Francisco, CaliforniaMy cousin and I have just returned from a 5 day/4 night stay in Florence and we enjoyed our stay at the the Helvetia  Bristol Hotel. It was in a central location for us, not to mention that it is close by upscale designer shops, like Armani, Ferragamo, Gucci, etc. (we thoroughly enjoyed daily window shopping!); our room was large enough for us, including a pretty good sizedbathroom which included all the usual bathroom amenities, including plush bathrobes and slippers. The hotel staff were veryfriendly, courteous, spoke English well and they helped us on several occasions regarding finding certain places on the city maps. And, on the day of my birthday, August 20th, when we returned to our room after an afternoon of souvenir shopping, we found a fruit tart (birthday cake) + birthday card for me waiting for us in our room, compliments of the hotel staff. That was so surprising and unexpected and so very nice of them to do that for us. I highly recommend the Helvetia  Bristol, and if I were to return to Florence in the distant future, I surely will stay there again.

<Content>Look no further I've been to several hotels in Florence- this is by FAR the best in the city. You might hear great things about the Savoy and the Lungarno and some others, and those hotels are lovely... but the Helvetia and Bristol is AMAZING. First, the location is nothing short of perfection. A 10-minute walk to the train station, and 3 mintues to the Duomo. Second, the rooms are gorgeous- the walls are covered in cloth, and the GM says all the furniture is antique. The rooms are large, luxurious, and light. The bathrooms are full of light and wonderful little details that can make your stay grand. The restaurant is out of this world. And the service... they are unbelievable. There's nothing they won't do, they're all smiles, and they always remember you. I've been lots of places around the world, and I love hotels like Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons... the Helvetia and Bristol is that wonderful, but not nearly as stuffy as the others can be. Look no further- this is the best hotel in Florence.

<Content>Excellent! A little gem in the best location, the Helvetia has extremely friendly and helpful staff. The concierge did a heroic job helping us recover our luggage lost by Alitalia. Our suite was gorgeous. The well functioning air conditioning was a life saver in the stiffling June heat. Breakfast was excellent. The hotel restaurant was very good, but outrageously priced even by high end European standards. If you are looking for a high end experience in a smaller hotel, you cannot do any better in Florence. Grazie Mille, Hotel Helvetia.

<Content>unforgetable vacation The location of the hotel was perfect.It was walking distant to piazza the republica , uffizi gallery, pointe vecchio, .......The breakfast was very good. The people working at the desk were very nice and helpful, and they were very accommodating ton our request regarding our room selection. We did not use their restaurant because we found it somehow dull. There was a very nice bar to the left of the hotel with a nice atmosphere which we liked a lot .the first room that we were given had a very uncomfortable bed therefore we had to change it. Altogether aside from the old and antique atmosphere I was satisfied with this place.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel in Central Florence The HB is a great choice of you're looking for a hotel in the center of Florence near all the action. It's about 2 blocks off Piazza Della Republica, a 5 minute walk from The Bridge and the river, walking distance to the the Uffizi, Pitti Palance... you couldn't ask for a better location to see the sights.The hotel itself has the atmosphere of a historic property (I think it's been operated continuously since the late 1800's), the staff speaks good english and provides great service, the rooms are large and well appointed but are starting to show some wear around the edges although not yet objectionable. The bathroom are enormous with tub/shower combos and even a bidet if you know how to use one of those things! The beds are comfortable and there's plenty of storage space in the closets. We got upgraded to a corner room and got a welcome plate of fruit since I was a Leaders Club member (join the Leaders Club at LHW.com.)One morning we unknowingly took advantage of the breakfast buffet only to find out when the bill came it was $29 euro. Don't get me wrong it was a perfectly nice breakfast but for nearly $45 US I'd grab something somewhere else.All in, I'd stay here again in Florence. The Savoy is also a great choice. I'd stay at the Savoy if you like a more modern atmosphere and at the HB if you like the feel of a historic hotel.

<Content>Still good but used to be better My wife and I first stayed here in 2002 when we got engaged. We loved the hotel, and the room, with its heavenly bed, linens, and the junior suite was generally speaking of a very high standard. So was the service, as well as the breakfast.This year, we stayed here again. The service was still fantastic, the suite we had booked was clean and also of a high standard, but the bathroom was way too small, lousy water pressure, the bed small and VERY hard. The breakfast buffet wasn't even close to the standard that it was six years ago- plus the new restaurant isn't quite as charming as the restaurant we ate in last time.In general, I'm somewhat disappointed and I don't feel that the price matches the quality anymore...

<Content>Perfect Location, Best Staff Ever, Beautiful and Comforable room We had the pleasure of staying at the Helvetia  Bristol Hotel in Florence at the end of April. The staff were incredible. They were available and happy to be of assistance. Upon checking in they toured us around the hotel(which was very charming and elegant.). They escorted us to our room and made sure that we were aware of all the amenities, The location was just about perfect. We had a short walk to all the museums, shops and beautiful piazzas. I would strongely recommend the Helvetia to anyone traveling to Florence.

<Content>I loved this hotel This was a absolutely charming hotel. The service and staff were excellent. The staff at the bar had a way of making you feel like a celebrity. The rooms were beautifully appointed and very spacious for a European hotel. The hotel was in a great location and we were able to walk to all of the major attractions. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely use this hotel again.

<Content>Good but not good enough My wife and I stayed in the HB for three nights before travelling on to Venice. I booked a suite @ 鈧?50 per night room only, the room was a good size but you could not look out of the windows because they were frosted and you could not open the windows because of the noise of air-conditioning units and the smell of the kitchen. The bathroom was nice but tired, as was the furniture in general. The bar was awful and the service worse, it took forever to get a drink and the same barman (one person only) was not only serving the bar but also the dining room. Moving on to the dining experience, the first night we arrived we were asked to eat in the bar (hardly 5*) and had a very, very nice meal until the bill arrived, we had ordered salt covered roasted Sea Bass which was priced 'per 100grms' (it was delicious by the way) the price on the bill for the fish only was 鈧?25 (approx 拢90), we were amazed and obviously queried the price, to be told it had been weighed in the kitchen, surely even G.Ramsay would not charge so much. The next night we were allowed to eat in the proper dining room, but we declined when we found that it had been used as a staff smoking room during the day, as the weather outside had been raining. There are better hotels in Florence for far less money.One other comment: do not stay at this hotel if you have, like me, a aversion to Americans, the owners must be giving US discounts because at times we felt like we were being invaded!

<Content>What a wonderful hotel From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, we felt like treasured guests in someone's home. The staff couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome and special. The breakfast buffet was the best in our trip (out of 6 hotels). The room was nice and large for the three of us.The porter returned our rental car for us, the internet access was easy and not to pricy and they were happy to give us a bucket of ice each night as well as easy friendly directions to everything we wanted to visit.The only downside was the shock of the price of our dinner in the restaurant. 1 steak, 1 fish for two and a bottle of wine and the price was $235 euro's. Yikes. We just didn't eat dinner there again.

<Content>Fantastic all around Our family stayed at the Helvetia  Bristol Hotel and nothing I say here will describe the exceptionally high level of service that we received. And the hotel is centrally located and you can walk to most of the major sights in Florence from there. We had booked a Jr. Suite with 2 rollaways for our kids and it was a spacious 2 level room with the master upstairs. The room was beautifully decorated and housekeeping did a fantastic job of cleaning and turn down at night. We used room service once and, though expensive, the food was delicious. More than any of this it was the staff who really made our stay memorable. They addressed us by name and were so friendly and welcoming, and willing to help with any request we had. They assisted us with dinner reservations and cab rides and whatever else we asked for. We wished we could have stayed longer, but if we ever return to Florence, this is where we are going to stay.

<Content>A JEM This hotel was the best that I encountered in Europe. The staff was very polite and knowlegeable. The room was clean and the beds were so comfortable. I am a stickler for cleanliness and this hotel met my expectations. The location of the hotel is also terrific, it is located in the heart of Florence and shopping is literrally just across the street. In a short minute you will be in stores like Louis Vuitton and Fendi. In 5-10 mins you will find your self at the Uffuzi Gallery and countless other places to shop.

<Content>Wonderful Week at Helvetia  My husband and I spent a delightful week at the Helvetia and Bristol in late June 2007. The hotel was central to everything but was like an oasis amid the hustle and bustle of Florence at the height of tourist season. We were greeted warmly by the staff, who continued to be friendly, attentive, and extremely helpful throughout our stay. The atmosphere was refined and quiet, but not stuffy or overly formal. We had a superior double room, which was not huge but was comfortably spacious for the 2 of us and well appointed. The marble bathroom was large and up to date with excellent amenities. Everything was kept spotless. The room was serviced twice daily, a nice touch since a shower before dinner was imperative after a day out sightseeing in the heat. No one from the service staff ever knocked on our door--the front desk appeared to note when we were in or out, and the room was always serviced while we were out. The hotel is very convenient to all the major historical sites and museums but is quiet and private. Americans will appreciate the just-right air conditioning. We found HB to be a good value and recommend it without hesitation to anyone contemplating a visit to Florence.

<Content>great location and service in florence We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel in June. the front desk is very helpful, especially with excellent directions. We were upgraded to a deluxe double(american express perk). the room was very large and well equiped, although it looked out on a side street full of motorcyles. Wooden shutters could be closed to block out most of the noise and light. The room was all done up in red . It could have used a little refurbishing but overall was a very nice room. The bed was a king sized and very comfortable.The room was serviced twice a day. The location was fantastic. it was never more than a few minutes walk to every museum and historical site. It is also close to the train station . There are many wonderful resturants nearby. The front desk also arranged for flowers from my husband for our 25th anniversary and sent up a lovely bottle of Prosecco. We enjoyed our stay very much.

It is located in the middle of everything. the buffet breakfast is excellent. we did not eat a dinner meal here, because we had special plans elsewhere. Great location... close to the White House and the Monuments...8th floor overlooks the White House...great location.jeff

<Content>Wonderful, Charming Hotel We had a wonderful stay at the Helvetia  Bristol. It is extremely well located, we were able to walk everywhere. We were upgraded to a junior suite, which was spacious and clean. The hotel is decorated with a European old world charm. What made the stay 5 stars was the wonderful front desk. They were warm, helpful and made us feel welcome. We got the room in a package with the breakfast. It was a typical European buffet. Not worth the price if it is not included, but a nice extra as part of a package.

<Content>Excellent Service My wife and I stayed at the hotel from January 13 through 18. We were thrilled, with one exeception.The location is phenomenal. The hotel is within 7 minutes of every important tourist site. The desk staff went to great lengths to answer every question and provide every service. They were warm, friendly and took the initiative to make sure that they fulfilled our every need,Our one issue was the temperature control in the room. We originally were given a room on the 2nd floor that faced the street. we asked for a quieter room. They placed us in room 276 - it faces an interior air shaft. It was quiet and the room was a good size. However, the room heated up pretty quickly and the air conditioning is not working in the winter. So we opened a window. BIg mistake. The first night I recieved about 25 mosquito bites. I am still itching. Otherwise I would reccomend this hotel to any and all.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel We have just returned from a fabulous weekend in Florence and can highly recommend the Helvetia and Bristol. This hotel seems to understand the importance of good old fashioned customer service and we couldn't fault them. The staff were extremely helpful and efficient and served you with a genuine smile. The room was very comfortable (although the bed itself was a liitle too firm for us) and the lounge area at the front of the hotel with it's open log fire was an ideal place to end the day.Our trip was to celebrate my girlfriends birthday and to our surprise, the hotel delivered a bottle of champagne to our room, compliments of the management. A very nice touch we thought.The location is very central for everything, very important when you have lots of walking around to do!We will definitley return to Florence and wouldn't stay anywhere else.

We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and could not have been happier. Upon arrival, Luca Finardi, the hotel manager, greeted up personally, a very nice and welcoming touch. He assured us that the hotel was preparing a lovely room for us, and we were thrilled to find ourselves in a beautiful and quiet suite. The hotel staff is charming, professional and extremely helpful, which we are convinced stems from Luca's hands-on management style. The entire concierge staff also was wonderful, particularly Paul. The hotel itself is very charming, filled with antiques, yet very up to date. The dining facilities are also terrific - we had wonderful breakfasts there daily, and enjoyed a magnificent dinner there as well one evening. The Helvetia is extremely well located as well, close to everything you can hope to experience in Firenze. We look forward to returning there in the near future.

<Content>Dirty carpeting I just stayed three nights at this hotel on a Tauck Tour. Room 265 was a superior double which means low end of a double room. Room compact and decorated in dark olive green which made it seem even smaller. NIce bathroom but no stall shower. Beige carpeting had an unbelievable amount of dark stains like shoe polish smuges. Asked to have room changed; hotel wouldn't, as they claimed they were all booked up. I was told the carpeting would be cleaned the next day. THIS NEVER HAPPENED.The buffet breakfast, buffet lunch and set dinner menus were skimpy and not worthy of a deemed five star property. Public areas are five star as is the location. Room gets a three star at most, food gets a one star.

<Content>Best place in all of Florence The Helvetia  Bristol exceeds all expectations, not only with the location but the entire staff. They actually are HAPPY to have you there and it shows--from the bellman, the desk personnel, the concierge (Paul) to the waiters in the restaurant. If I had only only negative thing to say is that here is no view but the rooms are tastefully Florentine and very comfortable, large baths, comfy beds, etc. They have a marvelous chef on staff and if you are lucky enough to be there when he does one of his creative price fixe dinners be sure to take advantage of it. It is easy walking distance to every sight you might want to see in the city of Florence.

<Content>Old-fashioned charm, centrally located I stayed at the HB for three nights. The hotel is centrally located which allows for stops during the day to drop off shopping, use the facilities, or put up your feet. The style of the hotel is well-appointed, old-fashioned European. The common rooms feel a bit like your grandmother's house where you need to sit straight and cannot put up your feet to rest.The bedrooms are not overly ample but also not cramped. Average sized with queen-sized bed, sitting chairs, desk, drawers and two small-ish closets. I was traveling on my own. If there were more than one person in the bathroom at one time, it would be quite tight. I used the help of the conceirge prior to arriving to arrange museum tickets and dinner reservations. They hotel added a surcharge to the tickets (which is to be expected). If you are handy on the computer you can avoid the surcharge and purchase most tickets right online. Their recommendations for meals were helpful.The breakfast buffet was a bit standard with meats, cheeses, muffins/cakes, and canned fruts. I would have hoped for something with more imagination and diversity (after 3 mornings). And, at a cost of more than 25 euros (if not included in your room rate) what I would consider a bit of a 'rip off'.Everyone who works at the HB is quite welcoming. They know your name and address you by your surname. Two mistakes were made ... I was overcharged for tickets purchsed (but had my original email with the tickets price quoted) and my roomrate was misquoted (mistake corrected). I would like to think they were both honest mistakes given the hotel's reputation for service. These errors remind me to always keep email quotes and confirmations.

<Content>Excellent and charming After being at the Royal Demeure in Siena, I have booked through American Express this hotel in Florence and I must say it was a very pleasant discovery.Apart from the high luxury furniture of our junior suite, perhaps a bit small,but this is quite common in palaces of the XVIII century in Florence, the room was delicous and decored with real antique furniture and a lovely mirror...The staff was very kind and helpful in many ways,typical of a 5 stars luxury structure.The only thing that I did not appreciate was a suggestion to visit a restaurant in Florence called Enoteca Pinchiorri ,where we did not eat italian cuisine as we requested and paid for a dinner for two 800 euros...the wine was also over priced.The following night we decided to dine at the hotel ,we spent only 60 euros in high luxury because of a 50 per cent discount for american express customers.The day we left the girl who sent us to 'Enoteca Pinchiorri' apologized because she said she would not know that the price was so high at that restaurant.Apart from that,I had a lovely stay.

<Content>Would not recommend Stayed at this hotel Sept. 20th for 4 nights. We were 3 ladies, and booked a Jr. Suite so we would have some room. The hotel is in the historic district of the city. The staff was very pleasant, but the hotel is in need of an update. I had booked a Jr. Suite and was very disappointed with my room, the front desk had said upon check-in that they upgraded me to a Suite (which I think was a line of bull), what that consisted of is 2 small single rooms, one with a double bed and the smallest bathroom I have ever came across, and a sitting room. The bathroom toliet was situated that if you were sitting and someone opened the door, they would break your knees, that is how close everything was in the bathroom. The outlet in the bathroom did not work, so they had to bring me an extension and run it out of the bathroom into the other room. The rugs were dirty, furniture was worn. They put the extra bed in the sitting area right underneath a window, so you really felt closed in. We practically had to climb over the chair in the sitting room to get on the extra bed. We were at the back of the hotel, and the noise at night is terrible, motorcycles, cars, people singing, talking, police sirens, just the worst. For the price we paid, iwhich was over 600 Euros it was very dissappointing. The furniture in the lobby looks a little worn. I did ask for a change of room (we were 3 ladies) but none were available when we checked in, I was told they were fully booked. However, the next day they did say another room was available, but it just was not worth packing everything up and wasting our time doing so. I would not recommend this hotel soley on the fact that the room size are so small especially if you are booking a Jr. Suite. Throughout my whole time in Italy we had booked Jr. Suites (Milan, Venice, Rome) and the Jr. Suites were beautiful in each. Breakfast was very small which was included. I think for the price we paid there are much better hotels.

<Content>Excellent in all areas! We stayed in hotels throughout Italy and this one was by far the best! We had a triple room that was really a suite - two rooms! There were flowers in both rooms upon arrival. The bathroom was a luxury, as well! Jacuzzi tub, separate shower, great lighting! I imagine there are different types of rooms, but ours was 5-star! The staff was delightful - helped with extraordinary problems, such as trying to contact our hotel in Latvia! We ate at the hotel and we all felt the meal was among the best we have ever had. It is also on a more quiet street, which was nice. They have wooden shutters to close at night to further mask any noise - we were on the first floor and all slept through the night without being awakened. Worth every penny!

<Content>A Wonderful Hotel We spent two nights here and would love to have stayed longer. Our room was spacious, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. How often do you get to sleep on well-pressed linen sheets? The staff was charming and friendly and recommended several local restaurants in a number of price ranges. The location couldn't be better and we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Five-Star Snobbery The accomidations of the Helvetia and Bristol are wonderful. Our room was very comfortable and our linens were expertly pressed. The room was cool and quiet, the bed was welcoming. The hotel is located close to many sites including the duomo. There was, unfortunately, one problem. The front staff and concierge were not of five-star quality. We often stood for several minutes at the front desk with no acknowledgement, not even eye contact. They, collectively, did nothing to make us feel welcomed or, at times, existent. We overheard the concierge offering other guest musem tickets and telling of great restaurants, but offered us nothing. When we inquired where we could here some live music, jazz perhaps we were told, well, basically that where they would normally send people was too expensive. Who were they to say what was appropriate for our budget? To say our visit was okay, is not reflective of the accomidations, just simply the front staff. They successfully made our visit unpleasant.

<Content>Will stay again and again I stayed at the Helvetia  Bristol for 5 nights as was thoroughly impressed by the hotel and its staff. the HB is well located and convenient to most central activities and sights. The rooms are individually decorated and well appointed. While some complain that the hotel can be a little noisy - because it is well located in an old city- it has no choice. It is part of the charm of HB and Florence - open the windows and indulge yourself!! (silence is found on an island) I have travelled extensively throughout the world and have stayed at many of the finest hotels in the world, and this ranks among them.Be sure to try the Restaurante Antinori around the corner for great food and wine samplings

<Content>Lovely hotel, if a bit pricey We travelled with friends, who selected this hotel. It was quite beautiful, and our room was spacious -- a pleasant change from our miniscule room in a similarly priced private hotel in Rome. We did hear street noise at night, but it wasn't bad. What was much worse, and quite incongruous, was the bad 80s American music played over and over in the otherwise beautiful restaurant. How odd to eat in that elegant red room while the theme song from Beverly Hills Cop is blaring at you! The music at the excellent breakfast buffet was much better. (Why don't they just play Italian music all the time?) The food in the restaurant was so so. Skip it and find a good little restaurant in Florence; there are excellent ones everywhere. Our first night there we were just too tired to brave the streets again and ate downstairs. A mistake. But the breakfast really is quite good, and included in the price of the room.The staff was extremely helpful and gracious and the bathroom was wonderful. The huge shower head and the towel warmer had me quite spoiled. And you can even find a washcloth in the bathroom -- two, in fact -- if you look on the shelf in the bathroom! (I'd already been told to bring my own washcloth.) Keep the bidet and give me washcloths!If you, like us, rent a car when leaving Florence to tour Tuscany, make sure your taxi driver lets you off at the right business. Ours dropped us off and zoomed off quick -- at the wrong rental car address. We dragged heavy luggage to the next four rental agencies before we found the right one. Otherwise, a perfect stay in Florence.

<Content>Overpriced - Living off it's former glories My wife and I were somewhat dissapointed with this hotel. We paid 385 Euros for a superior room but it seemed pretty small and standard to us, although it was clean. The room faced the noisy side of the buiding, so there is a lot of street noise till about 1 am. Also, we asked for a 7:00am wakeup call which never came.On the plus side most of the staff were freindly and helpful and the included breakfeast was very nice and the rose and chocolates on the bed at night was sweet.Witnessed one very angry american guest who was blasting the staff about luggage and transport problems to the airport - not sure if he was being fair though - but it was a concern to see.Would not stay here again unless it was much cheaper

<Content>Believe the hype This hotel exceeded expectations. We got a great package deal and stayed at the Helvetia  Bristol for 2 nights. The concierge was excellent and extremely helpful and the bedroom and bathroom were generous in size, beautifully decorated and came complete with all the little knick knacks you would expect of a top hotel. We heard that the breakfast buffet was a bit on the expensive side so decided to eat out which was hardly a problem since the hotel is right in the centre of the town and within walking distance of all the sights as well as the station. I would definitely use this hotel again and recommend it to any potential Florence visitors.

<Content>Fantastic! We have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Helvetia  Bristol. We arrived to a very warm welcome from the reception staff. They were very nice and very welcoming. The Receptionist took us straight to our room which was fantastic. It was elegantly decorated and very large. ( We stayed in a superior double on the 3rd floor) The bathroom was also very big with a jacuzzi and seperate shower.The hotel was completely spotless and was very charming. The staff were faltless and were very helpfull when we asked for good restaurants etc. Even making reservations for us.I cannot fault this Hotel at all. Even down to the little extras ( fresh fruit and flowers, bathrobes, slippers, chocolates)I would recomend this hotel to anyone and will certainly be staying here again.After reading the lonely planet guide book it is right in what its says....this hotel is a true Gem !!

<Content>Not worth it ... The hotel is old and it has mosquitos. I got stung six times on the face on my second night. It was awful. The service was just average. I asked the front desk to make dinner reservation for me but I didn't get a confirmation from him whether the reservation was made ... I had to follow up with him. The hotel is centrally located but it's old. We stayed in a superior double on the first floor which was close to the kitchen. We could hear the kitchen staff working .... It was just noisy... The complimentary fruit basket was nice. The bathroom amenities were nice (i.e., bathrobe, towel warmer ..etc.) I probably wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Great Experience My friend and I spent 4 nights at the Helvetia  Bristol Hotel. We had a wonderful stay and were amazed by the quality of the rooms! Big bedroom great bathroom! The hotel has a GREAT location with walking distance to major sites. From the SMN station the hotel was just a few minutes away. The breakfast was good but not excellent but the staff are very helpful. If you can get a reasonable price from them then do not hesitate!

<Content>5 Star hotel in a 5 Star city We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights the end of September. I have only great things to say about the hotel. We were upgraded to a suite with a quiet courtyard view. Ther staff was terrific, and the location tops in Florence. Our hotel choice in Florence came down to the HB and the Savoy. The Savoy, a block away is a lot like the W-Hotels, so if you like that over traditional elegance, go for it. Best rate for the hotel was on U-tell. Get breakfast included, it is excellent but about 30 euro. Florence is a great city, our favorite of the 9 cities of our trip. Make advanced reservations for the Uffizi and Accademia. I used Select Italy, and it worked well. Don't miss the Santa Croce.

<Content>Florence at its best Several years ago I was blessed with a situation that allowed me to visit Florence a couple of times a year. My plan was to stay in as many different hotels as I could. And so I stayed in a dozen or so of Florence's finest. A few months ago I stayed at the Helvetia. There is no reason for me to continue my search for the Best Hotel in Florence. The Helvetia is it. It is the most wonderful place to be when you are in Florence.

<Content>Excellent Hotel!!! This hotel was absolutely wonderful!! I was just there in Sept. (2004) and found the accomodations so beautiful and clean. The rooms (and bathroom) were huge and decorated beautifully with high ceilings and large windows that looked out over the city. The staff (especially Allesandro) was so professional and helpful. The meals were fantastic! The staff made us feel like we were home.
