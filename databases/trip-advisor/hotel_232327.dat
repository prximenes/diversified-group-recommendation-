<Content>Not so sure The Lobby is a lovely place to be, Very warm and homely, But the same cant be said for the rooms. Ours was a double room (no.26), on the second floor towards the back of the hotel, which, quite frankly was not clean. Food and crums under the bed and behind the tables, but nothing that couldn鈥檛 be sorted with a thorough clean. The plug sockets are in daft places, like halfway up the wall, which i found quite annoying. As for the noise of the trams on a review above, none of us five heard a thing, and is very well sound insulated. The breakfast is somewhat a joke though, as they had run out of nearly everything by about nine o鈥檆lock, and we ended up with jam sandwiches as they had run out of white bread, brown bread, tea cakes and croissants, and the cornflakes in the dispenser are sat there until they are used, thus very dry and old. If you are a coffee lover like me, there is no worries of them running out of it as there is always some there and is all ways fresh. Overall the staff are very helpful and will go out of their way to help you in any way possible. Pricing for drinks if rather high (3.40Euro for a coke can sized Heineken, where it was 2.70euro for SIX in the supermarket 50 yards down the road).

<Content>Good Value and Location This hotel is very close to all the main attractions of Amsterdam. The tram lines are just outside and Central Station a few minutes walk away. It is easy to get to any location from here. The rooms are clean and tidy as is the bathroom, but somewhat small. They are okay for a couple of nights but any longer you could feel a bit caged in. Breakfast is good with a selection of cereals, breads, cold meat and cheese. More than enough to start the day and was well replenished. The staff are friendly and helpful and were happy to give directions to various locations for us.

<Content>Bring your earplugs.... I stayed in this hotel during midsummer season, I had stayed in many 3 star hotels in Amsterdam before but this has to be the worst one, It was right beside the tramline so you had the ongoing drill of the tram bell late into the night and at early hours. The TV's signal also cut out and scrambled when a tram passed by. Around 7 am after a sleepless night the cleaning trolley crashed into my door, and kept repeatingly tapping off my door for about 30 mins.During the early hours of the morning of my third nights stay I was awoken by arguing going on in the corridor which carried on for about 15 minutes.There is also no air con in the hotelroom which isn't good for the middle of the summer, I couldn't leave a window open as I was on the first floor and due to the increase of noise from outside.

<Content>fabulous stay! There was lots of bad reviews I read about before going to Citadel and they did put me off a little. But have to say I was very pleased with the whole service. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms clean and tidy and not too small! And the location was perfect! Not 5* accomadation but for a weekend away it was perfect. The road that we were along can be very noisy - although it didn't bother us it may bother others. x

<Content>Not so bad I know this hotel has gotten some poor reviews lately, but I booked this hotel for daughter with a good experience here. She is very sensitive to dirt, mold, smells, etc and had no problems. Its a budget 3* (their triple room including breakfast was 270Euros for 2 night stay). The room was clean, convenient location within minutes walk of Centraal Station and Dam Sq, with trams across street. Staff friendly.

<Content>4 letter word for a 3 star hotel - DUMP This hotel may have a 3 star rating but it should really have a 0 star. Just 4 letters to describe this hotel, which should sum it up pretty accurately... a DUMP, despite its central location in the Amsterdam Centraal Station, Damrak and Dam Square area. The saving grace is the buffet continental breakfast, which is the highest rating for this hotel a 2 star breakfast. The room was literally a closet, somewhat foul smelling, and the shower was like a public shower in the ghetto. It is the only hotel that I stayed in where I was asked if I wanted the room cleaned... I always thought this was the routine for hotels is that the housekeeping staff cleans the room up daily. The funny and disgusting part of it was that housekeeping DID NOT clean our room for the 3 days we were there. With the above, I'll let you decide whether this DUMP is worth staying in.

<Content>Budget This hotel is a typical budget down town Amsterdam hotel. In other words, its not for you if you are looking for something nice and cosy. It's for you who are looking for cheaper great location, walking distance to the centrum and Amsterdam Centraal station. It's not to clean and rooms are small, typical down town European. I stay there because of price and location only and only when I'm alone, would not offer it for family.

<Content>Loved it all We too were let down by another online reservation company who hadn't sent our confirmation off to the relevant hotel. So stranded in Amsterdam we were given this Hotel as a spare by the Hotel info shop in Damrak Straat. We found the staff friendly and helpful, the rooms more than adequate for our needs, the maid service efficient and the breakfast comprehensive. I would have no hesitation returning there for another visit and would reccommend this for any short break stopovers.

<Content>Fantastic stay We stayed at The Citadel For 5 nights, the room was spotless and above all lovely and warm. The bathroom was clean and the hotel staff very helpfull. The Hotel is situated close to central station so there is no need to get a taxi, and about 5 minutes walk from Dam Square. We found it a very pleasant stay and are planning our next trip later this year to the same hotel. I strongly recommend Hotel Citadel to anyone visiting Amsterdam

<Content>great location having been let down by another hotel (see my review of hotel kasteelen)and left wandering amsterdam late at night after a flight delay, we went on the off chance to the citadel.we were greeted by a very helpful receptionist who gave us a room at a good rate inc breakfast,although very grateful for a room at this time of night, it was on the small side and smelt a bit of cigarettes and overlooked a concrete wall,so the next morning i asked at reception if they had a room on the front,this was arranged with the minimum of fuss.although previous reports have mentioned the trams this is not really a problem unless you go to bed early. but why do that when your in amsterdamyou can go to bed early at home!!! hotel is close to central station,dam square,canals,shops,several museums and the red light district. overall a good basic hotel with friendly helpful staff in a great location

<Content>Excellent Value Seven of us turned up on the doorstep of the Citadel Hotel, they were able to accomodate us and we were not dissappointed by this hotel.The rooms were clean, tidy and of a good size.The public areas, while small were also clean and tidy.The staff were very helpful and efficient.The room price included breakfast, which was of a high standard and quite varied.The location was ideal, within about ten minutes walk from Centraal Stn and a couple of minutes from Damrak.We noticed that most of the other guests were either couples or families.I am planning to return to Amsterdam again, this time with my wife and will book this hotel if available.As far as noisy trams are concerned then i suggest you do not visit european cities as they all seem to have them.

<Content>Great Location Stayed at Hotel Citadel for 3 nights 11th - 14th February. As previously stated by others the noise at the front of the hotel is loud at nights, especially the trams, though got used to it after the first night.Breakfast was fine, staff were fine, and the building it'self is very Dutch. The location is fantastic, and the over riding reason to stay here. A five minute walk with cases from Central Station, and within easy walking distance of all central Amsterdam has to offer.If you can put up with the noise, this is an ideal hotel to stay at for a short break. Alternatively pre book a room at the rear. I would stay here again if I go back to Amsterdam.

<Content>Comfortble triple The three of us have just returned form a very pleasant stay at the Citadel. It is centrally located and easily walkable from the station with your cases. Our room contained three single beds , ample hanging and shelf space for 3 nights, a bath with shower and lots of hot water. Located at the rear of the hotel we heard no trams or anything else. We ate at a different restaurant each night and all were good and nearby. Great variety of museums and lots to keep everyone busy for the stay. We would reccomend the Citadel to families.

Just returned from amsterdam from a 2 night stay from 13th feb to the 15th feb....Hotel was good, bathroom was clean, beds were clean, good choice of TV....Did not have the breakfast preferred the lie-ins as had big nights out....Hotel staff very helpful. Requested a room at the back of hotel before arrival as they trams can be noisy as other reviews said. We heard no trams. Vey central everthing...about 5 mins walk to everythin. Or you can tram it everywhere but be careful my partner steped onto the busy tram and i was just about to step on an the dors shut and off went my partner but he got off at the next stop. Must visit Liedsplein very lively. Overall will be staying at this hotel again!! RECOMENDED!!

<Content>Ideal no problems with this hotel at all Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Citadel we had a late arrival, was only a 5 minute walk from the central station, more or less straight down the road, just to the right of the dam rak. Rooms clean, fine as a base, showers were good, my friend had a wonky room on the top floor in the gables., this had a fab city view but the walls felt like they were closing in but reception moved her without any problems, breakfast was fab, plenty of choice. Hotel was very accomodating they will bring breakfast up to your room for an extra 5 euro. We booked through hotelconnect.co.uk. and had 3 nights for the price of 2.Great location, plenty of bars and restaurants nearby and only a short walk from the red light district if you want to see it.Tram stops straight out side the hotel, also it was next to the big police station so quite a safe place to stay in that respect.

<Content>Best location This is an old hotel that probably has never been renewed. Anyway, the rooms were confortable and the shower worked and this, for me, it's enough. The location is great, 2 minutes away from the Dam Platz (city centre) and no more than 5 minutes from the red light district. Certainly is not a 3 stars hotel, but if you are young and you're going to Amsterdam to do the same I did, I promise that it is enough!!!

<Content>good location we stayed in the hotel citadel just a few weeks ago, all the rooms were clean and the location was perfect to explore the city on foot day or night. however it lacks any wow factor but is clean. Breakfast was good and at least you can get a deacent cup of tea!the area around the hotel is well lit and plesent to walk around. If breakfast is to early a small shop near by sells pasteries, water and juice as well as several cafe's.

<Content>Decent Hotel, Great Location We stayed in this hotel the last week of May 2006. The rooms were very small but very clean. It's best attribute it how close it is to all the attractions. However, this is also it's downfall because the street it is located on is very busy. We were staying on the second floor and you can here the ringing of the trolley stop all night. I would stay in this hotel again but try and reserve a room in the back of the hotel.

<Content>Urgh ... the noise ... You have a choice - if you want a no-smoking room, your room will be on the first couple of floors and your ears will be assaulted by the noise of the trams passing by your window late into the night. As the previous reviewer stated, ear plugs are all you need. If you can suffer the smell of stale smoke, you will have a more quiet night.The rooms are clean, basic but functional. Our twin room had the beds pushed together with white duvets. The sheets are clean with the odd faded stain. Our bathroom had been upgraded with a nice powerful jet shower. We also had a brand new TV - whereas there was no PAY TV, there are still a dozen channels, some of which were in English. There is a lift that takes you up to the higher floors. The guests seemed to be a mixture of tourists and business people. Breakfast is served downstairs in the small lobby and is absolutely fine (7-10am). Three types of cereal, two types of cheese, three types of cold meat, croissants, brown bread and raisin bread, all sorts of herbal and fruit teas and coffee, as well as orange and apple juice. There are 10 tables available for breakfast, we went down at 8am and it was fine, at busy times, you may need to wait for a table.The hotel is 10 minutes walk from the Centraal train station and about 5 minutes walk from the Dam. It is situated on a main street with shops and restaurants with lots more within easy reach. There are a few 'coffee shops' around but we never encountered any problems, and felt safe for the whole duration of our trip. I consider the hotel suitable for children.

<Content>Not bad I stayed 1 night in this hotel and as other reviews had said the noise from the trams outside is quite bad. Saying that the room and shower/toilet were clean enough if rather small. The bed was definatley small.I looked out onto the main street and a tram must go rattaling past every 5 minutes so take some ear plugs or ask for a room at the back. Cost was 鈧?10 when booked on internet

<Content>What a nightmare Stayed at this Hotel 6th and 7th of May, had early flight and arrived at hotel at 10a.m, tried to book in but strict rules, 2pm earliest. Room was not ready and had to wait until 3 to get in, this was a nightmare as we needed some sleep in order to get back out and see the town. When we finally got in we tried to get our heads down, the room window was directly next to the housekeeping shed and above the lobby, it had only just been finished and they had sprayed what seemed to be a full can of airfreshener which was thick in the air, hard to breath, there was a massive row and arguments in this area for what seemed like ages, the housekeeper was scrubbing something right outside the window and the sound was terrible, this went on for what seemed like hours. the room itself was ok'ish but small and dingy, no views and no direct light. One good point was the location, it was right in the centre with easy access to everything. on finally getting back to the hotel at 3am after a good night, (Amsterdam is Great) we got our heads down, however guess what, at 9am prompt the housekeeper was back in his little shed, sleep? NO CHANCE.the final insult was that when we booked this room we were told by the receptionist it was 130 euros, on checking out we found that the price was 160, On making these comments in full to to receptionist in writing we got a lovely comment, basically this is how it is, no apoligy offered and certainly no offer to put things right, Would I go back. NO CHANCE.

<Content>Location, Location! We had a triple room, it was small but we were able to fit all our stuff. It has a nice size bathroom with toiletries (not the best, but none the less). We had a room in the back so noise was never an issue, although if you stay at the front of the hotel it might be. It was very clean and deserved its 3 stars. Breakfast was included in our rate and I have to say they were plentiful: bread, cheese , yougurt, cold cuts, coffee, jams, hard boiled eggs, etc. What I most loved about the place was the central location. We were able to walk everywhere or catch a tram in front of the hotel. Will be staying here again when we return. THe only down side is that tey did not provide internet access on site.

<Content>Certainly not 3 star A nice friendly welcome and helpful daytime staff when the wheelchair we'd booked in advance didn't turn up. Unfortunately 2 out of the three rooms we were given for our party of 5 stank of stale cigarette smoke. Two of the bathrooms had cracked sinks and broken tiles, the showers were all in need of upgrading. The rooms were cramped and one of the televisions could not be operated by remote control. When this was bought to the attention of the night staff the attitude was well we can't do anything you'll have to wait till the day staff come back on. Talking of televisions the pay channel service was not operational when we visited.  Breakfast the following morning was farcial. The decorators were in and over half the dining room was unavailable and only 5 tables seating 4 each were available which with over 60 wanting breakfast led to long delays before you could sit to eat. The mood was already downbeat from a poor nights sleep due to poorly fitted windows which led to excessive road noise for both rooms on the front of the hotel despite being on the 4th and 6th floors. The usual choice of meat cheese and bread with a variety of conserves was available but quality was not what you'd expect from a hotel marketed as 3 star.In the rooms bed linen had stains on and towels were small and rough in texture. New carpet had been fitted and furniture was basic and functional.The hotel's location, next to a police station, and within ten minutes walk of Centraal station is good and a tram/bus stop is within 40 metres of the front door. Steep steps lead down to reception and keycards are used to give access to the lift (carries maximum of 6) and rooms. Corridors are narrow and stairs between floors steeper than normal. Despite being on the edge of the Red light district and surrounded by Cannabis Cafes the area didn't feel dangerous. This was our third visit to Amsterdam and we will be back again but not to the Citadel unless considerable changes take place.

<Content>Don't go, redecorating around guests. We were really dissapointed. The first room offered was at the front and very noisy due to tram lines. Next room was tiny. In both rooms disgusting basins with cracked enamel. These were being replaced while we were there, so at 9.30 every morning the plumber starting bashing about.This also meant no water from about 10am for an unspesified time. On top of this they were having the breakfast room redecorated which meant we had to be squashed into an area with very little room between tables and so many squashed in some people were almost in the corridor. While watching the cement dust cover the breakfast trolley the workmen and hotel staff used the toilets that opened out onto the eating area. We were so fed up we moved to the hotel just up the road.

<Content>got a good deal so went to the Citadel We stayed in this hotel for four nights from 10 to 14 March. We actually chose it because we got a good deal with one of the internet companies who were offering 4 nights for the price of 3.On arrival we were given a room on the 6th floor with a view over the road. We were pleased as we had read some reports of rooms lower down being noisy from the trams that stop right outside and noise from the hotel kitchen very early in the morning. Unfortunately this particular room smelt strongly of cigarette smoke. There was no hesitation in giving us another room, in fact were given keys to two other rooms and we could go and choose ourselves which room we would like. The other room on this floor overlooking the road was very small so we chose a much larger one at the back, which still had a nice view and was probably even quieter. Could have done with higher bulb wattage though, very difficult to read in the room and the sink really does need updating in line with the rest of the room and hotel.The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant and always remembered which room were were in when asking for our key.There was a good choice at breakfast with the usual choice of cereals, hard boiled eggs, cheeses and meats with plenty of choice of breads (which could be toasted), rolls, croissants (although these ran out quickly) and fruit bread.This hotel is so convenient for everything, there are 5 trams that stop right outside, a lovely little pub on the corner 4 houses down. We had a very enjoyable stay here and loved Amsterdam. Hope to come back one day and would stay here again.

<Content>Don't Go!!!! I was so excited when I got to Amsteradm and ready to experience all the this city had to offer. But I was not at all ready for the nasty, tiny bathroom that we had. The hotel is located near a lot of attractions ie, The Red Light District, The Train Station, Restaurants ect, but it is just not what I am accustomed to! The shower was not only small but nasty the sink had scrapes in it and very dirty looking. When I asked for more towels I was told by the front desk attendant I will see what i can do.  I am still waiting on those towels. It smells like an ash tray in the hall way. I know what AMsterdam is all about but when I go to a hotel I expect a little more than what I received. If ever I am in AMsterdam again I will not stay at this hotel! Don't go, I am sure there is something a little nicer.

<Content>Hotel Citadel My cousins and I booked a 2 night break and were very impressed with the quality of the hotel. Bath (proper not continental) with overhead shower, spotlessly clean. Breakfast - cereals, tea, coffee, cakes, jams, rolls, boiled eggs etc and extremely helpful staff. Because we arrived early, bags were kept whilst we sampled the guided walking tour - definitely recommended. Excellent hotel only 8 mins walk from the station and within easy walking distance of shops, station, canal boats etc. Next door to police station!

<Content>a gem ! A very pleasant friendly clean hotel, no problems at all, everything just right for the weekend traveller.Ideal location to be close enough to the entertainmment, but far enough away from the night time hussle and bustle to gaurantee a pleasant sleepAll in all, you would probably struggle to find better for the price.

<Content>Good Value, Great Location. Very good hotel with great central location in Nieuwezijds Voorburgwhal. Five tramlines stop virtually outside the front door. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The shower didn't drain properly but this was minor really. I would certainly visit again. It was at least 1000% better than the dreadful Hotel Multitali where we stayed last time!

<Content>Good value A friend and I booked ourselves here last October (2003) as part of an online package. The rooms, while small and no-frills, were clean and comfortable; the bathroom was European style: toilet, sink, shower head mounted to the wall, with only a curtain partitioning it off. (I mention this for first-time American travelers, particularly, who might be taken by surprise by this arrangement.) The breakfast (included) consisted of bread and rolls, cheese, eggs, cereal; juice, tea, coffee. The neighborhood, while having some seedy aspects to it, was safe, centrally located, and there was a tram stop directly across from the hotel. In all, a sound value for the price.

<Content>Recommended Very nice hotel. In a really good location - it's only a 5 to 10 minute walk to any part of the city (including the main train station), and the hotel is right next to a police station, so it was quiet and safe. Also, there are trams almost right out the front. We had a double room with bath on the 4th floor which was very nice. The room was at the back of the hotel, and we didn鈥檛 hear any street noise. Staff were friendly enough. Breakfast was good, but not great. All up a decent enough place to stay, safe and a great location. Could be cheaper, but everything is a little expensive in Amsterdam (except for the coffeeshops of course).

<Content>Good "bang for the buck" The Citadel is a great value property located near Dam Square, Central Station, etc. The rooms are smallish (typical for the city) but the staff is superb. I've stayed twice and liked it each time!

<Content>Close to lots of 'offee Houses' and of course Dam Square The location is AWESOME-within a 10 minute walk of Centraal Station, Dam Square, the Scientologykerk, the Anne Frank House, and numerous coffee shops selling the best coffee in the world! The rooms were decent size, but we were facing the road and that sucked! The trams that went by early in the morning were very loud, and our room was right over the neon sign. The hotel also would not allow you to drink coffee in your room. The breakfast was all right but the bathrooms sucked.

<Content>Very well placed Very well placed, five minutes walking of the Damm square , the red district and the central train station. There is a tram just fifty meters away of the hotel. So, if you don脗麓t want to listen the noise of the trams, request a room in the back of the hotel or in the highest floors.The room that we had has a good size, with tv and safe. The bath was not as good as the room. The furniture a little 70 years style, but in good state.The breakfast normal-good, with jam, cheese, cereals, yoghourt, differente cakes, etc. The staff very nice and useful.
