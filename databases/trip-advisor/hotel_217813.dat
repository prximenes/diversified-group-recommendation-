<Content>Bad service, good location We stayed the first 5 nights of our holiday in a small boutique hotel in San Francisco and after changed to the Holiday Inn, unfortunately.. There was nothing really wrong with the hotel itself, but the service from the front desk was so unbelievably bad that I have not encountered such attitude anywhere else. On arrival we were placed into the Beach street annex of the hotel and the two ladies who worked there had really a bad attitude problem, maybe because they had to work in the cold lobby. The reception also closed during the night hours and it felt a bit unsafe to enter the hotel through a parking lot and find unmanned reception.Others the location was fabulous and the rooms were equipped very well. We were glad to get familiar with another part of San Francisco but would not choose this hotel again because of the service.

<Content>This hotel is fantastic We stayed here as our first stop from Australia on American holiday. I was not sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Location is excellent less than 2 blocks from fishermans Wharf  easy walking distance to cable tram and other attractions. We have 2 children 11  14 and it was a great location with low noise and comfortable facilities. The free breakfast was simple but nice  fantastic cost saver to start our holiday.There is a great bar acrooss the road called Knuckles and if you like beer you must go to Jac's bar which is easy walking distance. San Francisco was great and this hotel excellent way to see it all from...

<Content>Absolutely Loved it! What a great Hotel. We stayed here for 6 nights in August 2008 and we were completely blown away. The hotel is in a incredible location on Fisherman's Wharf with an approximate walk of ten minutes to Pier 39. There is so much to do here and everything is easily accessible as the trolley leaves just around the corner from the hotel.The room's were modern and very clean!! Spotless even!! The hotel staff were the best that I have ever encountered, they were so friendly and always willing to help us no matter what!Breakfast was included as part of our package and changed everyone morning but it was so yummy! Internet access was free the hotel even provided 2 computers for their guests to use in the lobby.The only thing that we were upset about was that our room did not have a fridge, we quickly got over that as we hardly spent any time in there.I highly recommend this hotel to everyone that is visiting San Francisco.

<Content>Great value for the location Being only a 2 star hotel I was not sure if it would be nice or not. It turned out to be great. You are within 2 blocks of the Warf, Ghiradeli, Boudin, the f line street car stop and the mason line cable car. The hotel staff was really friendly and the rooms were fine. It is also a nice bonus that you get breakfast. It was the standard holiday inn express spread but it fills you up.

<Content>Great Stay at HI Express Fisherman's Wharf We stayed here with our 3 children in a suite which was very quiet, comfortable and clean. The staff were efficient and friendly at check-in and the valets were helpful but as others have said the parking is expensive. On arrival the fridge in our room wasn't working- we contacted housekeeping and a whole new fridge appeared in 10 minutes!The location is great for all the sights in SFO. We hired bikes from the shop around the corner and rode from Fishermans Wharf, around the Bay and over the Golden Gate Bridge- a real highlight and the kids loved it. The breakfast can get busy but we always got a table- don't wait until the last 30-45mins though as they seemed to run out of the hot food. Altogether a great time and we would stay again.

<Content>Great Location and Clean Stayed at Holiday Inn Fisherman's Wharf Thursday October 2 and Friday October 3 2008. Arrived early and checked in immediately. They had a room ready., I had been told about the possibility of getting a room in the Beach building across the street and down the block. I was a little dissapointed when she told us we were in that building, but we did not ask to change it, as the main building were smoking rooms, Ours were nonsmoking. They offered to take our luggage over, but it was really just a short walk. We went to our room and were very satisfied. We loved the free wireless internet. We were only at this location for 2 nights, and we did get a ground floor room. There was a little street noise, I would recommend asking for a higher room if this would bother you. The desk at our building was open almost all the time and the employees were very helpful. We had to fax some papers for our balloon ride and something was not working. She tried and tried. She would not give up, even called the company and finally got the papers faxed. We did not eat in the restaurant in the hotel, because we have a strict rule for not going to any type of chain restaurant while visiting other cities,.  The location was perfect to visit the Fisherman's Wharf area. There is a most wonderful (5 stars out of 5) restaurant just down the block called Beach Street Grill. I highly recommend eating there for breakfast. We both had excellent food, outstanding friendly service and great Momosa's. If I were to stay near Fishermans Wharf again, I would definately look into this place again.

<Content>Strictly Average My husband and I stayed for 3 nights and, although most people raved about the hotel, I felt it was just average. The location, however, was perfect, since we were going to Alcatraz and also visited our nephew who lives in the nearby marina district (he wanted us to stay with him, but it's a one bedroom apartment, so I graciously declined). Although we're regular visitors to SF, I felt this room was smaller than the norm, but it was quiet, since it was at the end of the hallway. We didn't need any information from the front desk, so I can't comment on their service. We're Priority Club members, but we didn't receive any upgrades or other perks (our view was another section of the hotel). The free breakfast was a mob scene, so we didn't take full advantage of it, since there was nowhere to sit (I balanced a roll and juice on my lap, while sitting on a couch). The parking fee was also a negative, but I should have asked about it before we made the reservation. It looks like most of the hotel guests booked through Hotwire and I might have felt different if I'd gotten a cheaper rate, since I wouldn't expect as much.

<Content>Great Location. All in all a great hotel. GREAT LOCATION for pretty much every site in San Francisco. The shopping district was a short bus route away. Hop on a tour bus and get a good look at the whole city. It's fantastic. The breakfast was standard, it was a nice change to actually see a hotel in America doing complimentary breakfasts. The rooms were standard and comfortable. Clean and staff were friendly.

<Content>Great hotel with best location in Fisherman's Warf This is a beautiful great hotel located one block from the center of Fisherman's Warf in San Francisco. Safe area which allows you to walk to many San Francisco tourist spots. Restaurants everywhere. Trolley line at your doorstep for ease of getting around. We have stayed here before and love this hotel and location. This hotel sits right next to a regular Holiday Inn but this Holiday Inn Express is much newer and looks great from both the inside and out. Here are the only two things to be aware of: First, recheck the hotel website about a week before arrival to see if the rates have been lowered. We saved about $100 per night by doing this. Secondly, the fee for parking your car is $39 per day plus parking tax of $5.46. This is very pricey and is a hidden fee unless you read the fine print. Just be prepared. Overall, a Great experience and would stay here again and again.

<Content>Great Hotel!!!! We stayed here for 4 nights in Sept 2008. Location is great, rooms clean, service good, free internet access, valet parking was great service, close to all food and points of interestDown falls, no pool, parking $40 a day (ouch)Great place to stay, would recommend.But if you plan on using a car.....which I advise.....stay further out, parking is cheaper, hotels are cheaper, and you have to pay to park anyways anywhere in the Fishermans Wharf area.

<Content>Wonderful location My daughter  I found this hotel comfortable, in a great location and we were pleased with the cleanliness. It was easy to reach Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and the tram terminus. It didn't take more than 10 mins to walk to Lombard Street though it's uphill all the way. The hotel is only two streets away from the water/Embarcadero  we felt safe in the area. Parking was quite expensive, though in the city it is more expensive than here, however it was valet parking and the guys were very nice. We found the reception staff very helpful on check-in and through our five day stay. Our room was an internal one overlooking an internal atrium so we had no outside noise. The room was clean and there were plenty of towels in the bathroom.Breakfast is included in the price - you help yourself to cereal, Danish, buns, toast, eggs, some odd stuff I didn't recognise (but I'm British so it might have been grits?), sausages, fruit juices and other things. The choice was good however there are crowds of people from around 7am - jetlag worked in our favour in this instance so we were there before the hoards at 8am. There was still plenty later on although some of the guests were acting as though they weren't going to find anywhere to eat for the next year!! I'd have no hesitation in returning there as it was the ideal base for us in San Francisco. We booked through Hotwire and I didn't feel we had a bad deal from the hotel because of this.

<Content>It was just what we needed... My wife and I stayed here at the start of a 16-day trip (for three nights). We knew we would be late arriving (having missed a connecting flight) and had phoned ahead with our expected arrival time. When we arrived we found that Reception had made of note of this and check-in was smooth. Our room was in the middle of the hotel (very nice and quiet) and it was just what we needed after a long trip from the UK. We were staying here over the Labor Day weekend, so the hotel was busy. We only really noticed this at breakfast, and whilst there was plenty of food for everyone we did notice that at around 8am one morning free tables were scare. A very minor point, and only to be expected, and it didn't cause any problems. The hotel is excellently situated, being between the ends of two cable car lines and one block from the street car (tram). We would definately stay here again and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Great Location Great Hotel My wife and I have just completed a trip around the world staying at a variety of hotels, some bad, some good. We both rated this hotel very highly. The reception staff are kept very busy with the high volume of tours which come through but they still treated us with warmth and a smile. The concierge, Rhoda, was particularly helpful, as was their comically dressed bellboy, who was great at whistling down cabs and providing directions. If you are staying at this hotel try and get onto the 5th floor. This is the floor with the business centre. We stayed in room 506 which was large, clean and very well equipped with everything expected from a quality hotel. The king sized bed was also fantastic. We did not have any meals at the hotel as it is located very close to Walgreens supermarket. We saved lots of money buying fresh fruit and groceries from this store. The room also had a microwave oven which came in handy heating up a few TV meals. The coffee making machine was also a nice touch, especially for my wife! Fishermans Wharf is a great place to stay. Even though it is very touristy, its where the action is and there is lots of cheap clothing and characterful shop assistants. San Francisco is a superb city. For a fun filled day, if you have the energy catch a cab to Haight Ashbury, walk from Masonic down Haight St and check out all the great shops and survivors of the hippy and punk eras. Keep walking through Golden Gate Park ( about a 2 hour walk) visit the attractions and get right down to the Pacific Ocean. Just keep heading west towards the sun. There is a great hotel just to the left here. Have a few wines or beers and catch a cab home. What a day!

<Content>Great Place to Stay My wife and I are in our 60's and stayed at the Holiday Inn Express at Fisherman's Wharf for four nights in September 2008. Very clean, quiet modern room. Very comfortable beds. Convenient location to the Wharf which was extremely crowded when we were there. Lots of restaurants and touristy stores and stands nearby. Continental breakfast was adequate, but that's OK. Lots of tour buses and some mornings the dining area was crowded, but we always got a seat. Hotel has only valet parking which is a whopping $39.00 per day. Near cable cars and public transportation. We would stay there again.

<Content>Good choice My wife and I arrived in the morning intending to store our luggage until later in the day. The woman at the front desk checked, and a room was ready, so we checked in. The room was smaller than at the Hyatt across the street (which we had just checked out of), but pretty much standard for HI Express. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. We had no problems whatsoever during our stay. The free breakfast buffet had some hot items including cinnamon rolls, some pre-made cheese omelets, and bacon one day and sausages the next. We thought it was good enough to eat there again the second morning. The hotel is in a great location close to the wharf, and convenient for catching the streetcar, buses, and cable cars. We would stay there again.

<Content>Just OK Haing stayed in three different hotels in San Francisco, value and quality don't seem to be as good as other American cities. The good thing is that the city itself is so lovely you will forget about this.The service is basic, the room comfortable and clean. This hotel is frequented by tour groups so if faceless chain hotels are not your scene, don't stay here. You can't argue with the location, just a short walk to the Embarcardero and the cable cars to downtown. Breakfast is a chore - poor food and constant bumping into people because the buffet is too small for the number of guests. Overall, a forgettable experience but nothing too bad.

<Content>Terrible Service, especially if you book with Hotwire On arriving we had to wait for the front desk staff at the main building to finish playing with their hair before being checked in. They asked if we wanted a smoking or non-smoking king room and we said non-smoking. We had been put in the notorious beach building around the corner and across the street. As we entered the corridor there was an odd odour of car fumes and cigarettes but trusted the staff hadn't given us a smoking room. On entering the room the smell was awful, there was someone elses hair attached to the ceiling of the bathroom and the bed was clearly a single room. We couldn't understand it when I had signed a document at check in that said it was a non smoking king. We had a terrible nights sleep as we were on the ground floor and had buses and people being loud outside our room. As soon as we got up (not that I got much sleep - I didn't feel very safe) we asked the front desk in our building to move us. The room we moved to was twice the size and clearly a non-smoking room. The front desk, bell man etc in the beach house building are not reliable, half the time they were closed. When I needed quarters for the laundry (don't use the drier, your clothes would dry faster by blowing on them) we had to go all the way to the other building because they don't have any at the beach building. The internet was not working in our building as well. I am certain that we were given a single room because when collecting quarters a man at the front desk said we wanted to move from one and the number of his room put it in the same position as ours but on a different floor. In short, I wouldn't stay here again. They have poor customer service, unequal access to facilities based on where they put you and did not give me a room for 2 when that was what I paid for. It did not feel safe either.

<Content>Great Choice! Holiday Inn Express at the Wharf was a great choice! The hotel was very well maintained . Free breakfast was included and could always find a selection that was fine and would get your day started. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Location was super, could hop on a bus ,streetcar or walk to any attraction along the wharf area. Would absolutely stay again and would recommend it highly.

<Content>Great location I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for 5 nights at the start of September with my boyfriend. Hotel was in a great location 2 minutes walk from the heart of Fisherman's walk. Central San Francisco was easily accessible by streetcar just around the corner at a bargainous 80p. Our room was on the 2nd floor. Was clean and spacious and couldn't fault it. The hotel offers a free contintenal breakfast, We only had it one day as the choices of food were limited and it was very crammed when we went downstairs which was a little off putting.Free internet access in the lobby which was helpful.Would stay here agan as couldn't fault it.

<Content>Spot On! We chose to stay at the HI Express for a couple of reasons. Most of the Fishermans Wharf hotel were coming in at about the same price, so went with what looked like best value. The HI Express offers a free breakfast every morning, so that sealed the deal for us.Location can't be faulted, it's right in the middle of the Wharf. You can walk to pretty much anywhere within 5 mintues, including Pier 39 and cable car turnarounds. It is on North Point Street, a fairly quite street from our experience. Our room overlooked the street, and we had absolutely no complaints about road noise, or noise from other rooms for that matter. We were on the 4th (top) floor, right at the end of the corridor, which must have helped keep noise levels down. With only 4 floors, there was never a long wait for the elevator.The hotel looks very new, everything feels fresh, and everything was spotlessly clean. No complaints whatsoever, and the daily housekeeping did a good job. The bed itself was very comfy, though the room itself wasn't that large. Fine for the two of us, but you couldn't have fitted anyone else in there. Not a problem though, as we weren't there to spend time in the hotel. We found the two internet access PC's in the lobby very handy, and on only a couple of occasions did we have to wait.Breakfast was very good for a 'free' breakfast. They had the usual selection of cereal, fruit, yoghurts, pastries, muffins, etc, plus a small selection of cooked foods like sausages, bacon, egg, etc. Free coffee, juice and milk as well of course.The staff at the front desk were very friendly and polite. Both check-in and check-out were efficent. We didn't make use of the parking at the hotel, which at around $42 a day plus tip (it is valet only), we were glad we didn't have a car. The hotel does have an undercover pull in, which is big enough to hold a couple of cars, which was handy for us on checkout day as we collected a car from Avis just around the corner, and brought it back to the hotel to load up. They were happy for us to park in the drop-off area for 15 minutes to load up.We'd have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to others, and would certainly stay there again. It's not really that cheap (we paid $200 a night at the start of June 2008), but no more expensive that anywhere else in the area, but we were happy with what we got.

<Content>Great Hotel We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel. The entire staff were wonderful, the room was clean and a good size (we had 2 double beds for our family of four) and the hotel's decor was clean and fresh. The front desk staff were helpful, the cleaning staff did an excellent job cleaning our room daily and the breakfast staff did a fine job of replenishing food during an always hectic breakfast. The breakfast was excellent with a number of different choices (both hot and cold food available). One of my daughters' suffers from asthma. Unfortunately we could not book and be guaranteed a non smoking room through Hotwire in advance. However I contacted the Hotel on the morning of our arrival to request a non smoking room and upon our arrival later that day they had met my request and our non smoking room was ready for us(before 3 p.m. check-in) Our only concern would be the room location given to us. The room faced Beach St. and the F Line Streetcar roars by on Beach St. starting around 5:00 a.m. The Hotel's sound insulation was good but we often were still awakened by the sound of the streetcar in the morning. However we most certainly thought we got excellent value! The location in Fisherman's Wharf was excellent with easy access to public transit (both Cable Cars and the streetcar line). We rented a car for 3 of our 7 day stay and were able to find overnight street parking near the hotel every night which allowed us to save about $40 per night had we parked the car in the Hotel garage. My wife and I are both runners and we used the Hotel's fitness facility. As well it was a short run from the Hotel to the waterfront where we could run along the Embarcadero for several miles without worrying about vehicular traffic. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Fisherman's Wharf. I would HIGHLY recommend this Hotel.

<Content>Hard to Fault Had a four night city break to San Francisco in late June 2008. First time in the city and chose this hotel after looking at reviews on this site. We were not disappointed and found a lot of positive features. The price was good, especially when including the buffet breakfast which was simple but allowed enough choice to set you up for the day. We had two rooms between five and they were both good sized, clean and reasonably furnished. While we didn't have many occasions to require help from the staff, when we did we found them friendly and helpful. The big plus for this hotel is definitely the location, just off Fisherman's Wharf, with lots of attractions within walking distance. There is a MUNI terminus just around the corner and two cable car lines end close to the hotel. There are also plenty of restaurants in the surrounding area.For anyone looking for an affordable, well located base to explore San Francisco, we strongly recommend considering staying at this hotel.

<Content>Too few beds We booked 3 nights at the Holiday Inn Express San Francisco - Fisherman's Wharf through Hotwire. We booked the room for 2 adults and 2 children (age 11 and 14). When we arrived, we were told the room wasn't ready, but to go to lunch and come back in an hour or so. When we came back, we were given a room with one King sized bed for 4 people! They told us they could not give us 2 beds because they were oversold on those rooms. They also said that Hotwire didn't guarantee the number of beds in the room. I argued that Hotwire did guarantee a room that would sleep the number of people that the reservation is made for. They offered us a rollaway at no cost, but could not put a second rollaway in the room due to fire code. They suggested I call Hotwire and ask them to move us to a new hotel. Hotwire offered nothing to help us. The hotel told us to take it or leave it, since they knew we had prepaid the hotel stay at a fraction of the cost that they could book the room for. The hotel manager spoke to Hotwire on my cell phone, but never once came out to talk to us! We had to sleep 3 of us in the King sized bed! Buyer beware ... Hotwire is very vague as to the number of beds that are provided in a hotel. The hotel can do what they want. You are caught in the middle. I'm not sure I will book a hotel through Hotwire again.

<Content>Nice hotel in a great position Our family (4) enjoyed a nice stay at the Holiday Inn Express, Fishermans Wharf. Room was a good size, the breakfast was a good start to the day. Staff were friendly and the hotel is in a great location.If you plan to go to Alcatraz then book before you get here as it is vey popular and can get booked up, we were very lucky and got on the tour the first day of our 3 day visit after that the tour was booked up for the rest of the time we were there.

<Content>good location Stayed here for 3 nights in July. Hotel is clean and welcoming and extremly well situated but I have to agree with reviewer who complained about the expensive parking charge and the fiasco over breakfast. Although as usual the breakfast is included the room rate was expensive compared to other Holiday Inn Express hotels we have stayed in. The breakfast area was packed out and often nowhere to sit. Many peopel looked around and then had to take breakfast back to their room.Staff seemed to find it difficult to keep the shelves stocked and we were left disappointed with the remaining choice. Because this is a very large, busy hotel perhaps a bit more thought needs to be given to the layout of the breakfast area- moving toastersetc..Overall I would still recommend thsi hotel as the situation was excellent and the majority of staff extremely helpful.

<Content>Good what i wanted at a reasonable room rate. This is a overdue review, since i was at the hotel back in Dec 2005.As a Priority Club member, i have stayed in several 5-stars Intercontinental, Crowne Plaza and 4-stars Holiday Inn during my business and leisure trips thoughout Asia. This hotel is the first HI-Express i am staying in (not many HI-Express franchises in Asia), but since i am on a vacation and paying my own hotel bills, i don't mind and had no expectations whatsoever. I booked on the basis of the photos posted on the hote's website.When i arrived, i was pleasantly surprised by the clean and well kept condition of the place. It looks new and very well maintained, from the lobby to the elevators and to the rooms. Requested for a Alcatraz facing room and request was met. Great !The room is fairly alright for 2 persons, and very typical of the Holiday Inns i have stayed throughout Asia. The shower/toilet was cleaned. The room provides free wired internet and Playstation console.I guess the concept of HI-Express is minimal service and facilities. So that way, they keep cost down and room rates affordable. I paid about US$90 per night and i would say its a great deal considering the clean and well maintained room, the free self serve continental breakfast and the free internet. If what u need is a good room and safe hotel to sleep in, this is it. If you like to lounge around the hotel in the day, require a swimming pool. fitness centre or a bar in the evening, try the Hyatt across the road or Sheraton around the corner. My wife and I were there for a vacation, so we returned to the room past 10pm and out the next day by 10am. So we are happy with the price and quality.Good location too. The last stop of the tram is a short walk away, and so is the pier where u can see the crab stalls. The free train ride to Union Sq is also just round the corner, and getting to ferry terminal to Alcatraz is a 8 minutes pleasant walk. Lots of food options around, from burgers to cafes.I enjoyed my 3 nights stay there. Am thinking of returning in Dec 08 for a couple of nights, whilst on the way to Orlando.

<Content>Great location We stayed at this hotel for two nights after disembarking our Panama Canal cruise. This hotel was in a perfect location for sightseeing and only a 5 minute taxi ride from the cruise pier. We enjoyed walking to sight see at Pier 39, Lombard Street and Fishermans Wharf area. We had 3 rooms as were travelling with our extended family. The lobby was very large and contains the breakfast area. Breakfast was adequate and included. Our rooms were clean and quite large. We used the valet parking and had no problems.

<Content>Above Expectations Recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Fisherman's Wharf for four days with my teenage daughter. Great loacation, walking distance to most of the sites of the city. The staff was extremely accomodating and helpful....very impressed with the service. The rooms were very clean. The breakfast bar was packed each morning, but hey...it's free! I was hesitant when I booked this because it was rated 2 1/2 stars through Priceline, through which I have only booked 4 star hotels. Even though the hotel isn't considered full-service; no bar, pool etc., it deserves a better rating. Considering the cost of most other hotels in San Francisco, and walking by some of the other 2 star hotels, I would return here without question.Florida traveler.

<Content>Good choice for Fisherman's Wharf We stayed at the HI-FW the weekend of August 8, 2008. We found the hotel to be a good choice for our trip. We were in the Main Building (the one with the front desk) at the corner of Levenworth and Bay. This location is located right in between Ghiardelli Square and Pier 39. About a 10 minute walk to either.We stayed on the business floor since we are Priority Club members. I was able to see both Alcatraz Island and the Golden Gate Bridge from my room, so that was cool. I believe it was room 565.There is a Walgreen's drug store one block from the hotel so that made stocking up on water and forgotten items easy and affordable. We did not rent a car and took taxi's or public transportation. The taxi from the airport (SFO) was $50 including a nice tip. A taxi to union square is $10 from the hotel. About $15 to the downtown financial district.We love the garlic crab at the Crab House on pier 39. We ate there twice. We went to a Giants game at ATT Park. We shopped at Union Square and Chinatown. All were fun.The Holiday Inn has 2 buildings. The one with the Denny's is about 1 block East of the Main Building. Both are well located to all the stuff in the area. We go to SF every couple of years and the Holiday Inn was comparable to the other chain hotels in FW. Some are a little closer to Pier 39 if that matters to you (5 minute walk instead of 10.) I recommend the Holiday Inn if staying in the FW area.

<Content>Dreadful experience in exhorbitantly priced budget hotel We booked this hotel for two nights through Expedia.com at a cost of $342.00 per night for what turned out to be a budget hotel. On arrival no assistance was available to help with the luggage and we had to look for a luggage trolley to bring our luggage to our room. Rooms were clean and adequate, if somewhat drab and location was good. However, the exorbitant price we paid for the room was not reflected in any way whatsoever in the room or service. It might be reasonable value at a third of the price we paid. Free internet (2 PCs provided) was supplied but was not working on our first night. As with most San Francisco hotels, car parking is expensive and at $44.00 per night, this hotel was no exceptionBreakfast was a complete fiasco on both mornings and we cannot understand how other reviewers spoke so favourably about it. People mobbed around the self-service breakfast area and had to use cardboard trays, plastic knives and forks as well as paper cups and plates. Food variety and standards were poor with service very bad and with a large number of guests milling around, the queue for food was very slow. There was nowhere to sit to eat breakfast with all tables used up, other guests using all lounge chairs in the foyer of the hotel whilst the remainder had no choice but to carry their breakfast to their rooms. Without any doubt this was the most astonishingly dreadful breakfast experience we have had in nearly 40 years of staying in hotels around the world. Our stay at this hotel was an unbelievable experience, an absolute disgrace at any price but at $342.00 per night it was appalling.

<Content>Loved this hotel!! My husband and I stayed here during our cross-country trip (by car). The service was superb and location; the best. Literally, right around the corner from Fisherman's Wharf and the Pier. The cable car and Gharadelli Sq. are right there too. We couldn't have picked a better location. Not to mention- safe! This hotel is close to everything yet very quiet. The breakfast buffet (included in room rate) was way above average. It had everything you wanted. The room was very large (king bed) and clean. We would recommend this hotel in an instant.

<Content>Great Stay We stayed here for 2 nights in August and found it to be a great choice. The hotel was extremely clean and our room on 4th floor was very quiet. The breakfast was also very good and I was hesitant after reading some complaints about breakfast area and although we found it to be crowded , it was well stocked and a nice amenity. We had considered Comfort Inn at Van Ness and must say we definitely made the right choice. Very close to everything fun to do! Just 2 blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. I am very particular about where I stay and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Better than expected Very new  clean, perfect rooms and surroundings. Within very easy walking distance (a few blocks) from Fishermans Wharf. The only problem is parking. Beware, I didn't read in reviews that their parking garage at the hotel can fill up. We had to drop off luggage then drive around the corner to Anchorage Parking Garage to store our car at $30 per night (24 hour parking, no in/out). It actually worked out fine because you'll either want to walk to Fisherman's wharf or ride a taxi to other locations, but just a warning. I was not expecting to not be able to park at the hotel. Other than that we had a great time and worth the money to stay close to where you are going to be. We took a tour and went to 50 different movie sites, it was awesome! We wished we had more time to go out to Alcatraz, if you get here and see it, you'll know why.

<Content>Loved Holiday Inn Express Fishermans Wharf We spent 4 nights at this hotel. It was very clean and we were provided with an excellent suite on the 4th Floor with views to Alcatraz. I do not like traffic noise and this hotel was very very quiet. Our room was all we expected. It had a coffee percolator and tea making facilities. We travelled with our 14 year old teenage son. The hotel is very close to all the attractions to Fishermans Wharf. The breakfast was adequate and we had no complaints. The buffet is not extensive, but if you are happy with cereal, yoghurt, fruit and pastries, omlettes or scrambled eggs- then you will enjoy the meal. Staff were always attentive.

<Content>Nice hotel, Great Location We just spent 3 nights here and had a great experience. Two blocks from the Wharf excitement, but far enough from the noise to sleep at night. The rooms were clean, so were the hallways. Front desk staff was very helpful and we enjoyed the free breakfast in the morning. More than enough choices for parents with two teenagers. I was able to use the internet and we printed out our boarding passes for free. Valet parking is pricey, though.

<Content>Great for the price! Stayed 3 nights for $89 per night, booked through Hotwire. Great rate considering normal rate was $230 from the web site. Hotel was in a great location within easy walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf. Requested a quiet room and was assigned one at the end of the hotel, facing one of the small courtyards. Breakfast was great - ample food and wide variety. Very happy with the facilities, internet (included in cost) worked fine. In summary, I'd happily recommend this hotel if you get a deal but not at the normal room rate, as you could probably get a better class of hotel in the area for same or slightly more.

<Content>Did The Job ! Our first time in San Francisco, decided to stay in the Wharf area and from TA hotel reviews decided to stay at Holiday Inn Express.We stayed for 4 nights, the room was very clean and well supplied. The breakfast fare was very good and plentyful.It is well situated to use the public transport system either to the Wharf / Pier 39 / Ferry Buildings area or up to Union Square area. Did not have a car but noted valet parking @ $37 per night which appeared to be the norm for SF.The staff were very helpful.I would use this hotel again when returning to this area.

<Content>Perfect hotel for the area My husband and I just returned from a trip to SF and stayed 3 nights at the HI Express FW. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel was extremely clean, had a wonderful breakfast, the staff was nice and the location was perfect. We stayed at another hotel in SF for the first part of our week (wanted to stay in two different areas while we were in the city) and this one far exceeded the other hotel. The breakfast was especially helpful and saved us at least $20-$30/day. The staff was very friendly and helpful; even helped book our shuttle bus ride back to the airport. The location was perfect because it was one or two blocks from the main attractions; close enough to be very convenient yet not too close to all of the hustle and bustle. Overall, this was an excellent hotel and I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Average for the Area It was about what you would expect for this area - overpriced, parking ripoff, noisy accomodations. I thought the room was small and the beds worn out. I did like the breakfast which is a real time  money saver if you are traveling with kids. I asked a couple of questions at the front desk and found the staff apethetic at best. The Marriott across the street is nicer, and if you get the room/park combo it's about $10 less expensive per night.

<Content>Great hotel, Great Value for Families My family and I just completed a stay at this hotel and would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good, clean hotel at a decent price. The location of this hotel was great - two blocks from Fisherman's Wharf and two blocks from the cable car line. The staff was very helpful. The iron in the room malfunctioned one morning when we were rushing to get to a tour and a security guard brought up a new iron since the housekeeping staff hadn't started yet. Also, our flight home wasn't until 12:30 a.m. and we stayed at the hotel until 9:30 p.m. and paid a day rate which was only 50% of the normal rate. This enabled us to continue to sightsee on our last day and then clean up and relax before going to the airport. The expanded continental breakfast is quick and easy and everyone was always able to find something they liked to start the day. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling with a family on vacation.

<Content>Great Stay We arrived early several hours before check-in time and were pleased that we were able to check right in. The hotel is in a very convenient location, easy walking to all the Fisherman's Wharf attractions. It's also very close to the several cable car stops and has a taxi waiting area right across the street. We had a fair sized king room on the fourth floor with a king sized bed. The room was clean and comfortable but with no view. The hectic complimentary buffet breakfasts were convenient but they were often slow replenishing items that were finished. Front desk service was friendly and helpful. Price could have been a little lower but overall a perfectly fine stay.

<Content>Great location - room - service. Stayed 3 nights (June 12-15, 2008) in a King room on the 1st floor. There was no view, just a courtyard of windows - but that didn't matter, because we were sightseeing from morning til night and I was too tired to care when we were finished. If you need a nice hotel, in a great/safe location, with a clean room  free breakfast - look no further. We got a rate of $187 per night through the hotels website - and when you factor in the complimentary breakfast - that's a pretty good deal. There is plenty to eat - not just danish  coffee. They had hot cinnamon rolls, cold cereal, carton milk, eggs (scrambled or omelet depending on the day), bacon or sausage (depending on the day) biscuits and gravy (daily), and then breads, english muffins and bagels. If this doesn't work for you, there is a Denny's literally right around the corner - as well as a Walgreen in case you need pop/water, medicine, sunscreen, snacks, toothpaste, film developing, socks - or anything else you forgot or think you might need. The turnaround for the Powell-Mason is only 2 blocks from the hotel. You can pay $5 per way, per person. Or buy a 3-day unlimited ride pass for $18 per person. We chose this option which gave us no excuse to explore the city more.Overall a great hotel - no complaints! The rooms were big  clean. Had in-room safe, iron, ironing board, coffee, internet, movies, video games, etc. There are 2 computers for internet access just off the lobby that are available 24/7, at no cost. Great for printing boarding passes for the flight home, booking tours, researching restaurants and attractions - and checking your emails from home - as well as sending the standard wish you were here email to the folks back home.

<Content>Nice Location, Parking Pricey We stayed at the HI Express for two nights and everything was fine. We had a large clean comfortable room with a king size bed and a very large bathroom on the second floor (no view). The free breakfast was a little crazy, but to be expected located in a tourist mecca.The room rate was a tad expensive, but you are paying for location, location, location. The fee to park was outrageous; $37 per night + 14% tax. Two nights of parking cost $84.00 plus valet tips each time you take the car out. This was painful.I would recommend this hotel, if you can stomach the parking fee and all the tourists.

<Content>Convenient, clean hotel with good service We stayed here for 5 nights (June 10-14) in 2008. The room was ready upon arrival and was very clean. We called ahead to ask for a room along the north face of the hotel as this would give us a view out towards the bay. When we got there we were told they really didn't reserve rooms in spots just details like King bed or non-smoking. So our view was just another wall of the hotel. Other than that, the staff was extremely nice and I realize that everyone would want that view so I guess it's just the luck of the draw.  The complimentary breakfast was pretty good. They had cinnamon rolls, bananas, bagels, various cereals, bread for toast, bacon or sausage (seemed to alternate), biscuits, gravy, milk and various juices. There may have been more but we can't remember. The food was good (not great). And the crowds were generally not too bad except for Saturday morning.  The room wasn't large but it was fine for what we wanted. Just a place to relax between excursions around San Francisco. It was very clean and had a decent decor for a regular hotel. The staff was always friendly and willing to answer any questions we had.  We considered it an excellent deal for the price we got off Hotwire as the location near Fisherman's Wharf was the best feature of the hotel. A quick walk to several attractions made our sightseeing easier. We didn't rent a car because so many forms of public transportation are within a couple of blocks from the hotel. The selection of television channels were pretty sparse but we didn't spend tons of time in the room aside from showering and sleeping so that didn't bother us too much. I would suggest trying to find a deal online if you can. We saw a guy walk in off the street and they were asking $239.00 for the one room they had.

<Content>Great Hotel! Stayed at this hotel June 6-9, in King Bed standard room. Room was very clean and nicely decorated although not overly big (but who cares...your not going to SF to stay in your room!)Common areas were also very clean. Two computer stations near the front desk with printers available 24/7. Nice complimenary breakfast included (cheese omlettes or scrambled eggs, sausage or bacon, biscuits  gravy, yogurts, cereals, fresh cinnamon buns, toast, coffee and juices).Location was great. Close but not too close to Fisherman's Wharf. Two blocks from Powell  Hyde Cable Car stop (can buy 1, 3 and 7-day MUNI passes at booth at this location). Two blocks from F Line stop. Walgreens and Safeway also a few blocks - good for snacks, drinks, etc. for your room.Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.I converted my Air Miles into Priority Points for three nights free - nice!.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Great Location Used my Priority Points for a two night stay. This is a nice Holiday Inn Express with a wonderful location. The first room we were given was on the 4th floor and was tiny, with no view. Called the front desk and asked for a room with some sort of view. The only available room with an outside view was on the smoking floor, but we decided to try it out. There was no smoking smell in the hallways and the room we chose had no smell of smoking at all. (Room 370). Very nice room with good views and the windows did open so we could get some fresh air! Yes, it was loud with the windows open, but with them closed, it was quiet. The beds were very comfortable, staff was friendly and accomodating and a great location! Breakfast was nice with both hot and cold items. Sure saves a lot of money! We did the Super Sightseeing Tours which is next door to the hotel. We did two tours (Muir Woods and City) as we only had one day to really get out and see the city. I am glad we did! Safe location - Cost Plus World Market right down the street, so we bought our wine and snacks there and enjoyed it in the room! I would definitelly recommend this hotel for a trip to San Francisco. Wish we would have had more time in the beautiful city.

<Content>Perfect location Great location, 5 mins from harbour and 10 mins from Pier 39. Room was in Holiday Express building 2nd floor overlooking main road and trams. Didnt find it noisy at all. Room was clean, comfy, staff pleasant, breakfast fine, although the 1 evening meal there was disappointing. There is a large late night Walgreen supermarket across the street which had food, toiletries, drinks etc etc, plenty of eating places around. Highly recommend Boudins on the Wharf for breakfast, sourdough soup and ambience. Really recommend taking yr own hairdryer to Holiday Inns in the US, the ones supplied are weak and lethal!

<Content>Good hotel - would stay again Stayed here for 3 nights in May. Very happy with the hotel which is in a great location. The room was pretty standard but it was spotlessly clean, the furnishings were good, it was nice and quiet and overall very comfortable.The continental breakfast was tasty and there was a pretty good choice.What more could you want ! I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Does the job with great service When I booked this hotel, one of the main considerations was proximity to Pier 35 as we were taking a cruise to Alaska. We settled on the Holiday Inn Express after trolling through the many reviews on the different hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf area, and I'm happy to say it fit the bill exactly. If you're looking for a hotel with lots of history and character, don't come here. However, if all you need is a comfortable bed, a quiet room, a safe location and friendly service it's perfect. Previous reviews had also mentioned asking for a room facing the courtyard to minimise noise - I included this when making my internet booking, and our wish was granted, with our room also being on the top floor. Our flight from Australia was scheduled to arrive around 10.30am, but a quick call to the hotel a couple of days before confirmed they had a luggage room if we needed to kill a couple of hours before check-in. Imagine our surprise and pleasure when, on arriving at the hotel around midday, we were given our room straight away. The hotel has a free business centre near reception, with two PCs with internet access, plus a printer. There's also a breakfast area on the ground floor, with a free continental breakfast included in the price. It's not exactly gourmet, and our first experience there was a little overwhelming as a large school group were staying - enough said! However, the Hollywood Cafe a couple of doors down did a great lunchtime BLT, so I'd imagine their breakfast was pretty good too. There's a pretty good sports bar/restaurant right across the street, plus there's also a Safeway and a Walgreens a block or so east on North Point. We found the staff unfailingly helpful and friendly, the bed was very comfortable, and the room EXTREMELY quiet. The hotel's just far enough away from the main action at Fisherman's Wharf to be quiet, but is just a five minute walk away.Once we checked out, Pier 35 was an easy walk of 5 blocks, towing our bags along. While this style of hotel may not be to everyone's taste, it does the job well.

<Content>Great place to stay in San Fran We are members of Priority Club so we booked a reward night for one night. This hotel is modern  clean, and the staff was very friendly. Valet parking is $37 per night which is average for the area. The hotel is in a great location with walking distance to all major attractions. The complimentary breakfast was good too. We will stay here again for sure, its a great hotel.

<Content>well impressed Me and my fiance stayed here in may 08 for four nights. I had read some reviews prior to our stay and I did have my doubts but we were very pleasantly surprised when we arrived. Of course bearing in mind this is only a 3 star hotel and you would not expect the ritz I can honestly say the staff could not have been nicer, they were very friendly and efficient, from the check in to the cleaning staff. The room was very clean and spacious, the breakfast was very nice too. we didnt book this hotel the travel agency did that for us, but if and when we go back to San Francisco I will definately stay here again. Thanks to all at the Holiday Inn Express. Oh and its very well located too .

<Content>excellent choice Stayed here for 3 nights, first impressions were of modern, clean hotel. Rooms were of good size, we asked for top floor room which had a bit of a view over the harbour and also turned out to be quiet as well. Comfortable beds, soft and firm pillows allowed good nights sleep, coffee maker, clean bathroom with all the necessary bits and pieces included. Cool bucket supplied and with ice maker and vending machine down the corridor, (mini fridge would be better suited.) Internet access downstairs with 2 computers to allow one to check e mail etc.( free service in the room.) Breakfast was choice of cereals, yoghurts, toast, pastry and choice of 3 hot plates, never any rush and plenty of food. Yes would be nice to have a bar or restaraunt in the hotel but really it is location here that is important, this hotel is minutes away from all the touristy areas with all sorts of eating establishments and with easy acces to public transport. We had a hire car which the valet allowed us to leave at the front door free of charge while we unloaded our cases and checked into the room , then we returned our car to local depot. No need for a hire car in SF, public transport is fun, easy and cheap while public parking is expensive. Shuttle bus to the door should take 30-40 mins and $12-15. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>OK stay - could have been better My wife and I stayed at the HI Express for one night as part of our one week stay in SF and the surrounding areas. We had stayed off Market Street earlier in our trip, and wanted to stay in Fisherman's Wharf to visit Alcatraz and the Golden Gate bridge..The hotel's common areas are stylish - and give an Art Deco look. Definitely gave the hotel a new look.Staff were all very friendly giving directions and information re: the surrounding areas.Was a little disappointed in the hotel room - small, especially for a Holiday Inn Express. Lacked certain amenities such as two soap bars (one for the sink and another for the bathtub), a small selection of TV channels.AC was very loud as the unit was right next to the bedView was awful through the one set of windows in the room - it was of the rest of the hotel.Free internet service included, along with breakfast til 9:30Valet parking: $37! ouch, but common for the area.I've stayed at the Hyatt across the street in the past, and this time was just maybe $10-20 more, but probably worth it.

<Content>Great location, and MORE! This is a gem in the City by the Bay!!!Only a block from all the fun and excitement in San Francisco, 1.5 blocks from Fishermans wharf, and 1 block from the F trolley line.Even close to it all, you hear almost nothing, as the rooms are well insulated.We chose the mini suite, which had the kitchenette, and sofa extra, and had a large bathroom and entry way! Lots of closet space, and very comfortable beds!The breakfast was just amazing as other posters had indicated!It was changed daily with full hot options, cereals, beverages, and pastries. Excellent layout so you were not tripping over fellow guests, and a large area to enjoy your meal and plan your day!HIGHLY recommended !! Well done Holiday Inn Express!!!

<Content>Great location! Quite pricey though. My mother and I stayed here from May 3rd through May 6th. We had never been to San Francisco and wanted to be in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf, which it was. It was an easy walk there and was within easy walking distance of most of the public transporation options.We had a room on the third floor that overlooked the sports bar across the street. The room was clean and the bathroom quite large. When we first entered the room, we thought the windows were open judging by the noise level. Upon inspection, they were actually closed! Thankfully after it got dark, it seemed to get much quieter outside. I did not have any trouble sleeping.The room includes a breakfast, which was quite good. They had eggs (with or without cheese), bacon, biscuits, sausage gravy, toast, bagels and these wonderful cinnamon rolls. We were impressed by how much variety there was for a free breakfast.The room was very nice, the breakfast good, but we were not impressed with the price of $270 a night we paid. I would probably stay here again, if we could get a great rate.

<Content>Good Stay at Holiday Inn Express Stayed 3 nights at this hotel and had an enjoyable stay. Our room was on the 4th floor and just looked out onto a void courtyard but this meant that it was very quiet. The beds were very comfortable and had a choice of soft or hard pillows. The bathroom was a bit on the small side. The hotel is in a good position for Pier 39 at Fishermans Wharf and easy walking to lots of other attractions. The breakfasts were ok, but not a huge choice, we did have a problem one morning finding a free table to sit at. We arranged a taxi through the hotel back to the airport, the taxi arrived promptly and for 4 people cost just under $40.

<Content>This was THE PERFECT HOTEL!!!!!! We absolutely loved this hotel! Stayed for four nights in room 483 and 485 (the fourth floor is the top floor so this is not a huge place). There was no view as you are sandwiched in between hotels and other buildings but we didn't come to sit in the room. We paid $62/night through hotwire.com on a rather last-minute trip and this was an extraordinary value for this normally $200+ night hotel. The hotel looks like it is brand new!! It is probably the cleanest, best maintained hotel we've stayed in and we've stayed in a lot, including upscale five star establishments! The furniture, furnishings, linens, beds ... everything ... top notch and in perfect working and very comfortable condition. The staff, including the maids, are all very friendly and helpful. The new hot breakfast is very good and saves a ton of $ on breakfast every morning. The only complaint - well, a couple complaints, is it isn't very hot. The hot items are lukewarm at best and the variety is the same every day. Some pancakes or waffles would be a nice touch as not everyone enjoys biscuits and gravy (a daily offering). The other complaint that really doesn't have as much to do with the hotel is the other guests - every morning we had pushy, rude people crowding in trying to cut in line, like a bunch of pigs waiting for food at the trough. The thing the hotel could do to mitigate this is re-think the way the breakfast is set up. Logistically it could be set up in a better way to avoid people crowding in. It is fantastic that they provide a hot breakfast, it is good and the gentlemen manning the breakfast ensure there is never anything empty, they do a very nice job. A nice touch are the two free computers they provide in the lobby for internet use. They are even hooked up to printers which was great to be able to print out city maps etc. They do get busy though and the waiting line can be long. The hotel location is perfect and so close to everything you'd want to do. We didn't have a car to worry about the exorbanant parking charges; we took the 'Go Lorries' airport shuttle both to/from the airport which worked out wonderfully. We walked everywhere or used the 3-day MUNI passes we purchased for $18 to ride the cable cars, streetcars and bus system all over SF. The passes were well worth the money. We would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat and we were sorry to leave!

<Content>beware of expensive valet parking We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights as part of our Virgin Golden Triangle tour and it was by far the nicest hotel.Rooms very comfortable and modern,good beds, towels and bedding changed daily if you wished. Good central location but we found Fishermans Wharf dirty, full of tramps and over-rated! Free breakfast is great. The only downside of this hotel is the VERY EXPENSIVE parking fee of $42 a night. We have never had to pay to park our car in a hotel we are guests in and found it a totally unreasonable charge. After our first night we found that we could park on the road on a meter from 7pm to 7am for free outside the front of the hotel and then moved the car into a $10 car park for the day. We later found that further along North Point there is free road parking day and night in some parts so its worth looking for, but be carefull to check the road signs each time you park as the roads are cleaned between 2am and 6am on alternate days of the week. We visited the Golden Gate Bridge\park, the Presidio, Muir Woods and Sausalito and they were all great, if you have a car drive up and down all the steep roads, great fun! Go up to Twin Peaks for views to die for of the whole of San Francisco.

<Content>Good for the price The good: - great location - clean, newer feeling hotel - decent breakfast - good servicethe bad: - very noisy, especially noise coming from hallway - small roomsBreakfast was much better than a continental breakfast, but maybe not quite as good as a Dennys or something. Each day had some type of egg, sausage or bacon, and a variety of breads, muffins, rolls, yogurt, juices, milk, coffee, etc. No pancakes, waffles, or anything like that.Rooms are pretty noisy. First night someone adjacent to us had a cough, so we got to hear that most of the night. Also, anytime someone shut a door or talked in the hallway it sounded almost like they were in your room.Location was great. You can walk to all the areas in Fisherman's wharf, to the Alcatraz Pier 33 (15 mins) parts of Golden Gate National Rec Area, Ghiradelli, Cannery, Powell/Hyde cable car turnaround, etc.

<Content>Good choice near the Wharf This H I Express is the nicest we've stayed in by far. We were pleased with the solid construction - never heard neighbor noise or traffic noise (we had courtyard rooms.) The breakfast bar was fully stocked for a large crowd and they kept it full for the entire morning. The room was updated and stocked with all the right things, the beds were comfortable and the fiber-filled pillow selection was great.We only had 2 complaints:1) no wireless in the rooms. They do have connections in the rooms, but it doesn't work easily for Mac users. The staff was very attentive in trying to help us make it work, but in the end, we just used 1 of the 2 computers near the lobby that they keep open for guest use, which is very helpful.2) despite a reservation for 2 adjacent rooms made 6 months ago, the only thing they had available were two 1st floor streetside rooms (they admitted the rooms were noisy.). But they accommodated by putting us on the quieter 3rd floor. Though the rooms were far apart, they didn't question us when we had our teens stay alone in the 2nd room. (Many hotels have a problem with that.)The hotel is near some great restaurants (Joe's Crab Shack - great family friendly menu and view over fun goings on in the wharfside street) and Boudin (very good chowder - recommend the outdoor eatery - less hectic.) It's an easy walk to Ghiradelli  Cannery Row and a pleasant, do-able walk to Pier 39.Transportation advice: The hotel is near the 2 starting point terminals for cable cars, but if you go after 10 am, you're looking at a half hour wait (an hour on weekends.) However the historic street car (the F line) that travels down Embacadero isn't too crowded except during the 4:30 - 6pm rush hour. And that's only $1.50 per trip. That line can take you to the Ferry Building area, or to Union Square. From there you could walk up to ChinaTown. We wasted our money on the 3 day $18 municipal pass. The cable cars were too crowded to make use of, so we used the buses or the streetcars, which are significantly cheaper.Our family's favorite things - Alacatraz (get tix a day in advance or order from alcatrazcruises.com online), a Giants game and Pier 39 (sea lions, shops and Hard Rock Cafe). Due to the cold weather, we didn't rent bikes and ride through G G park or across the bridge. Next time . . .

<Content>Nice Stay, but Watch the Parking Charge Nice stay. The room was plenty large for the 4 of us. Breakfast was really good. However, they don't have wireless connections in the room, so I had to go down to the Lobby. Then, I never could connect to their system and ended up connecting to the Hyatt's. Weird.Also, watch out for the parking charge. It is a big $37 bucks. Looking around, the Marriott parking charge was $22 bucks.

<Content>GREAT PLACE!!! - Modern, clean, large size rooms, Free Full Breakfast +Internet Holiday Inn Express - Fishermans Wharf was a great value. I would highly recommend it. I stayed 2 nights at this hotel March 7 - 9th 2008 and the staff were very friendly, the FREE breakfast was more than I expected (biscuits+gravy, eggs, bacon, sausage, juice, bagels, cereal, pancakes), and the rooms were clean with granite countertops and a wet bar, mini fridge, and comfy beds. The last night of my stay in San Francisco I stayed in the Sheraton Fishermans Wharf which was a nice hotel but I would much rather stay at the Holiday Inn Express next visit as its breakfast are FREE and the internet was FREE plus there was a big difference in price...I saved lots of money at the Holiday Inn Express. The hotel is new and very modern, perfect for families, couples, or even the business traveler. The location is perfect as you can easily walk to everything..the cable cars, buses, and all the attractions. My suggestion is to purchase a Go San Francisco Card you pay one price about $75.00 for 3 days and it includes all the tourist attractions you can visit...museums, Palace of Fine Arts, Exploritorium, Aquarium, Wine Tours, Alcatraz, Boat Cruises, Cable Car Rides, bike rentals..and much more. Great upbeat attitude when I called the front desk and a pleasant experience checking out. I travel 3 weeks out of a month for Business and It was a home away from home.

<Content>Good choice I chose the Holiday Inn Express Fisherman's Wharf primarily for location and because I was using Priority Club Points. I was not really expecting much. But I was so pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The location is indeed great. It is (obviously) near Fisherman's Wharf, but it is also near both Cable Car lines and Ghiardelli Square. It is near Golden Gate Park and plenty of shopping and restaurants. Check-in was pleasant and easy. However, they only offer valet parking, which is vey, VERY expensive. But San Francisco is an expensive city. There are probably cheaper options nearby. The hotel is very well maintained and the art deco, cruise ship theme works well. Our room was fine. Spacious enough and clean. We were in a corner room, with a bay window which actually looked out at The Bay. There was only an ON/OFF switch for the air-conditioning/heat. No other controls. And we had to search for that, as it was hidden in the closet. Very odd. The weather was cool, so we kept our windows open at night.There is a free breakfast buffet every morning, with plenty to offer and lots of space to sit. This is a well run, nice, clean friendly place to stay. Go for it.

<Content>Great!! This hotel was very clean, centrally located, staff was friendly and helpful and the room/bed was comfortable. We were not disturbed by noise at night, the breakfast was diverse and plentiful, everything was great. The location is unbeatable - you can easily walk to the Fisherman's Wharf area (Pier 39) or if you decide to see a more cultural/non-touristy side of San Fran, you can simply walk inland instead. I recommend renting a Go Car on Hyde - that is a blast. It was sort-of cold when we were there, but it was still a great trip. Holiday Inn Express was perfect as usual.

<Content>Spring Break Stay at Holiday Inn Express We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Holiday Inn Express for Spring Break. It was very comfortable and convenient. Food and shopping was within easy walking distance from the hotel. Breakfast and high speed internet was included so that was an added bonus. I would definitely recommend this to other families and I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>An absolute gem The first thing i have to say is that this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at - for many reasons. First the location is fabulous, you are a very short walk from Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39. You are also close to the cable car stop. There are several great restuarants in the area, our favourites being Bubba Gumps and The Rainforest Cafe - both fun places, with good food and service. Our room was a good size, well equipped, comfortable and quiet. We had no view at all, we over looked other rooms, but who goes to San Francisco to stay in their room. The bed was amazingly comfortable - if only we could have sneaked it home in our cases.the free breakfast was wonderful. especially considering it was free. There was plenty of room to sit, plenty of food, and it was replenished through the morning (during the set hours) There were plenty of healthy options available too. It certainly set us up for the day, and nobody seemed to mind us taking fruit with us (for a mid-morning power snack!) .The staff were polite, helpful and willing to help when we needed assistance.Having free internet access in the lobby was great, there are two computers and at times we had to wait to use them , but if we popped back to the hotel mid-afternoon (to drop off shopping!) they were usually available.The hotel is clean, and nicely decorated and has a welcoming feel to it. Like other people who wrote reviews, we were on the first floor and had to use the lift as the stairs were all marked as fire exits. But this is such a small thing to mention, and lets face it you're going to get plenty of exercise walking up and down those hills - you'll probably be glad of the lifts. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. We plan to return to San Francisco in a couple of years, and will certainly be stopping here again.

<Content>A pleasant surprise! Better than expected! But beware the grouchy valet We arrived at the hotel rather late on Saturday night (830pm). We pulled up into the driveway where the parking valet is stationed. My husband got out of the car and asked him if they had a self-parking garage. The valet had an attitude. He said, No, valet only. Is that something you want? I wanted to say, actually, from you, no...but what other choices do we have in Fishermans Wharf ?? The valet stood by and watched us as we unloaded the luggage. He didn't even offer to help...not that we expected him to. As he wrote up the valet claim ticket, he said, You're checking into the Holiday Inn Express, right? Not the Holiday Inn? Because that's next door... Frankly, he acted bored, like he wanted to be somewhere else. Too bad he's the 1st person the hotel guests meet.Thankfully, checking in changed our 1st impression! Our reservation was for a 2-Queen beds, non-smoking room. The very nice, courteous, front desk clerk upgraded us to their version of a suite (wet bar sink, microwave, small fridge, sofa) at no extra charge! I don't know if it was because we arrived so late, but what a pleasant surprise! (A regular 2-queen bed room at the Hyatt is about $35 more)The hotel decor is Art Deco. The room was very clean, very comfortable. We had one of the suites facing Northpoint St, across from the Hyatt. Surprisingly, it wasn't as noisy as we anticipated because there was very little traffic in the area. The breakfast buffet is included. Not bad (meaning, we've had worse). There were cinnamon rolls, scrambled eggs (looked like Egg Beaters), sausages, biscuits and gravy. There was a good assortment of cereals, bread (toaster!) and muffins. There were all kinds of beverages (low  fat-free milk, juices, coffee, tea) but strangely, no ice. We ate at the height of the breakfast hour (8am), so finding a table was a challenge.Overall, I'd say we would stay at the Holiday Inn Express- Fishermans Wharf again. The location is great!

<Content>Great Location This hotel is, as it鈥檚 name suggests, ideally located for Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf, being just a couple of blocks away. Also well within walking distance are the shops and restaurants of Pier 39, the Alcatraz tours departing from Pier 31 and the cablecar turnaround at Hyde.Around the corner there are many tourist shops selling everything a tourist could hope to buy. We also rented bikes for a day from a store here.The hotel is a fairly modern block, although the outside looks very Art Deco, and the room we had was reasonably spacious, clean and well decorated. A king size bed, TV, table and chair are in the main area. The bathroom has a bath, with shower, toilet, sink and hairdryer. A coffee pot is also provided. If it鈥檚 important to you, make sure you request a room with an outside view as our room looked out onto an internal blank space although we had a view of the sky to see the weather (rooms with an outside view won鈥檛 have much of a view anyway just onto the road).Our room was located on the 1st floor (2nd to North American readers) and, annoyingly, the only stairways we could find were all marked as being emergency exits only. Accordingly we had to use the rather slow lifts to travel up and down one floor!A continental breakfast was included in our booking - cereal, toast, coffee, juice, fruit and pastries were all available. If you prefer something cooked, we understand you can obtain a voucher at reception, which can be put towards the cost of breakfast in the Denny鈥檚 attached to the Holiday Inn next door.There鈥檚 no bar in the hotel (that we could find) if you fancy a night cap but there is a sports bar directly across the street. There is a small gym and free internet access on the ground floor.Although we didn鈥檛 require it, parking is available at the hotel but we鈥檇 recommend checking the cost first as it struck us as being ludicrously expensive (although perhaps not for San Francisco - we don鈥檛 know).Check-in and check-out where quick and efficient and the airport shuttle organised for us by reception turned up on time to take us back to SFO. ($14 each one way)Although the surrounding streets have many hotel options in competition, the HI Express was quite busy which probably says a lot for it鈥檚 great value and location. We certainly would have no hesitation in returning here and indeed, plan to do so later in the year. An excellent choice.

<Content>Comfortable, clean and good value Stayed in a large room with 2 queen beds and kitchenette. Very comfortable beds and room was spotlessly clean and nicely decorated. Location was great for using public transport and had shops and fast food/family type eateries nearby. Breakfast was complimentary and had a good selection of items available. 2 computers available for guests in small area off the reception and free wireless internet in rooms.

<Content>Greatly Exceeded Expectations I really didn't have high expectations at all of staying at a Holiday Inn, but I was pleasantly surprised. This hotel is really nice. It's clean, has new decorations, a nice little gym, lovely smelling toiletries, really friendly staff, and a good breakfast (that's included in the price). One really cannot ask for more. It's also in a fantastic location, near the seafront, which beats Union Square any day, as there are few bums loitering, unlike around all the Union Square hotels. There is no room service, but I think internet connection is free. The parking, as pretty much everywhere else in SF, is rather expensive. It's a relaxed hotel, and I felt far more comfortable staying at the Holiday Inn Express than I did at the Fairmont to be honest, and it's cleaner than the Fairmont too. It's by no means a luxury hotel, but it's definitely above average, and I would very happily go back there to stay again.

<Content>Holiday Inn Express is a great deal My family of 4 just spent a night at the Holiday Inn Express, and were pleasantly surprised with the great location and comfort of the room. We had a family suite on the second floor. It was VERY large, with a living room, small kitchenette and a huge bathroom. It was nicely decorated, with a marble sink, and nice furniture. It was everything we needed to hang out after a long day of traipsing around the city. My husband  I could read in the living room while the kids watched TV on the beds. The free continental breakfast was perfectly adequate, with a variety of pastries, cereal  fruit. And the location is great - just a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf, Ghirardelli Square  the cable cars. We had to book at the last minute, without shopping around much, but we thought it was a bargain for $225, and I'm sure with some shopping around, you could get a better price on Expedia or Priceline. If we were to come back to SF and had a week, this is definitely where we would stay - it has everything.

<Content>Better than expected I'm just wrapping up a stay in San Fran's Holiday Inn Express in Fisherman's Wharf. Overall I would rate this experience as above average. The entire 4 days we were in the city it rained/downpoured, but we were entertained none the less. The hotel was nice and clean with the staff always around. Our room was on the second floor, but we hardly ever heard the road and we're pretty light sleepers. They serve a continental breakfast in the morning which is nothing extravagant but a nice little meal before you start your day. The have internet in the rooms and two computers for community use down in the lobby. The computers are pretty old though and there is always people waiting so I'd bring your own if you are going to email often.Parking is pricy, but seeing as how we were on business work paid...$37 a night.Try Mood- Thai foor and Sushi on Beach St. one block away. Yellow curry and pineapple fried rice were oh so good and pretty inexpensive.If weather permits I reccomend a hike in Muir Woods, over Golden Gate to Pirates Cove... Eat at Dipseas for lunch.Overall you can't beat this hotel's location. It's right on fisherman's wharf and is a bargain price.

<Content>Great Location Location, location, location. This hotel is perfectly located. Fisherman's Wharf area is 2.5 blocks to the north and the cable car turnaround to Union Square is 1.5 blocks to the south. Pier 33 for the Alcatraz tour is a 15 minute (8 blocks) walk.If you drive to SF just leave your car parked at the hotel and walk or take public transportation everywhere. Hotel is valet parking only at $37 per 24 hour period. Staying at the Holiday Inn Express gives you priviledges to amenities (such as the swimming pool) at the Holiday Inn which is located next door and the next block down. The front desk staff very friendly and helpful. The room was extremely clean. In-room safe included. The beds could use new mattresses. Ours were dead, no spring or bounce to them. I would stay here again the next time I visit the Fisherman Wharf area.

<Content>Great Location Stopped here over New Years and did some sight seeing. The location of this hotel is amazing and all the other major brand hotels are clustered around. Right next to streetcars, cable car and the wharves. Walking distance to bars and restaurants. The hotel is in the same building as the Holiday Inn.The room we had was small compared to others in the hotel but clean and well maintained. The front desk were helpful although it was always busy and we often had to stand in line before we could speak to somebody. Great free breakfast, but that is the only food or beverage service available inside the hotel. Valet parking at $35 per day with unlimited access and ability to enter or leave the park. A great place to stay and cheaper than the surrounding hotels.

<Content>Very nice hotel My family and I booked this hotel for the last day of our vacation before we returned to Vancouver. I saw the reviews online but I did not expect the hotel to be this nice. We paid ~210 for 1king and sofa bed for a stay on New Years Day Dec31 07. We were going to stay at Best Western near SFO but ended up here because of its great location near the Wharf. It's only a ~5minute walk there! The staff were all courteous and polite. The rooms look pretty new and everything seems to be in shape, no leaky faucets, squeeky bath tubs, busted light bulbs..etc. My only complaint in the pricey $39 parking, which isnt even valet. But I guess thats the market price around this area of the city anyway. The security in this hotel seems to be pretty good. There were people watching over the parkade and room keys are needed to access the hotel guest rooms. I will definately stay here again in the future if we come back to San Francisco.

<Content>Location, Location, Location My wife loves SF, so when her 50th birthday rolled around, that's where she wanted to go. I got a very good deal on Hotwire for two nights. The rooms are standard fare, very clean, large bathroom, firm, queen beds. A closet safe, TV, table and chairs, coffee maker, thick towels, internet access, hair dryer and all the stuff that we have come to expect in most of the better hotels enhances our stay.We're off and running. Two easy blocks, slightly downhill to the Fisherman's Wharf. Strolling, observing, stopping for snacks. I even got pulled into a street performance. They needed a slightly overweight, big guy, to pick up the girl and stand on the performers chest as he laid in broken glass. My daughter was slightly embarrassed by the whole thing but my wife was cracking up. We ate well, spent a little more than normal in the tourist trap, but for the most part it was very good... My wife is partial to fish and crab.. and the wharf is a good place to find itThe next day, after the continental breakfast, (which we all loved and felt was quite complete and generous) we decided to take the bus to the Union Square for shopping. $1.50 a head, with free transfer. We rode thru the Chinese area on the way. Many older ladies got on with their shopping bags and gossiped at breakneck speed. As we passed, I noticed the stores selling food were jammed. I felt transported to a crowded Asia. I quietly commented to my Asian wife that she will look right at home on this bus in a few years chatting with all the old ladies.. That comment was overheard by the lady sitting across from us who laughed out loud upon hearing it. We chatted with her and had some laughs. We had fun shopping in the stores. Macy's has 7 floors on each side of the street, 7 for men, 7 for women. That was pretty cool.. I bought my wife a nice gift.A reasonable $10 fare to take us taxi back to the hotel.. We rested, then strolled some more, all jacketed and ready for the cold San Francisco nights. We slept well that night and came home safely.The hotel served it's purpose more than adequately. The location, the full continental breakfast, and the cleanliness of the room stand out in my mind. The beds were sturdy and comfortable.. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only negative is those damn parking fees in SF, $35 a night plus tax. We could have saved about 7-10 dollars a night by parking off site and walking but it wasn't really worth it to me. But the Hotwire mostly deal offset it..I know now that Holiday Inn Express can deliver comfort and convenience to the traveler and tourist. Without equivocation, I can tell you it's as good or better than the 4 star hotels we've visited.

<Content>Stay Away!!! I have no idea why there are so many good reviews for this hotel. Quite possibly one of the ugliest hotels in San Francisco, inside and out. The beds in our room were the worst I have slept on in years. We woke up with sore backs. The rooms were outdated. The floor was wet in one corner of our room. The heating/AC was very very loud. Other guests were very loud and staff did not quiet them. When we asked to switch rooms, our request was denied.We found used tissues on the floor of our room upon check-in. When we asked the front desk about a good place to eat in San Francisco, the mecca of good restaurants, we were told to go to the hotel's on-site DENNY'S.This hotel was very disappointing. There is no way it deserves a 4. The service was poor. The housekeeping was poor. The look and smell of the hotel was poor. The location was decent, but who cares about that when you are walking around with a sore back all day from the hard beds where I could outline all of the individual springs. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Exceeded expectations Stayed here as last resort using points and I was impressed. Like others mention, it is in a good location. We walked to fisherman's wharf for dinner at Alioto's (highly recommend). The room was clean, nicely furnished, and the concierge was helpful when helping to find a restaurant for dinner. The breakfast brunch was good, although a little pricey, The overall service was good. I have tried to avoid Holiday Inns until staying at this property...it definitely exceeded my expectations.

<Content>Great Location, nice hotel We stayed in this hotel as the last leg of our golden triangle trip, it was very clean and bright, much newer than the other two hotels we had stayed in, although it seemed very business like.The room was large, with 2 double beds, a nice bathroom and cleaned daily, although if you wish to stay in your room later than 8am I would hang the privacy tag on the door as the maid knocks early and loudly!!!!The breakfast is basic, but free, so very convenient. The location of the hotel is great, I much preferred being by the wharf as opposed to staying near Union Square in down town.....The one thing I will complain about is the valet parking, this may be more of a complaint to take up with my travel company as we were not fore-warned that we had to pay $35 per day valet parking, with no other options open to us.The transportation was fantastic, and cable cars are great fun!!! Would definately recommend San Francisco!!!!

<Content>Not worth the price paid After reading other reviews of this hotel I thought that it would be the best bet for our family-weekend in San Francisco. Seemed to have a good location, competitive price, and is fairly new. I found the best deal by pre-paying directly on the hotel website and even chose a mini-suite as it would be myself, my wife, and my two young boys so I wanted a little extra room.So, check-in went fine and the valet parking was great. $35 + tax per day with in/out priviliges. The hotel is decorated well and is very clean. The hallways are very wide and, overall, the 'feel' is very appealing. Once we found our room (4th floor overlooking the wharf) I was a bit disappointed. The mini-suite means that there is a fold-out couch sitting in the window area and an area is setup with sink, mini-fridge, microwave. I do admit that the kitchenette area was good to have, but the room itself was not much larger than a normal room. I was expecting a bit more I guess - oh well.Once we unpacked I noticed that the walls were VERY thin. I could hear the TV from the room next to us, water running from what seemed to be every bathroom, and the noise from people in the hall was overwhelming. This was a huge turn-off for us. I realize that you get noise when you are in a hotel but this was a bit extreme.The next morning we went down for the Continental Breakfast. This is definitely nice to have, although the quality of the food was not that great. You cannot expect too much for a Continental Breakfast so take these comments as just that, comments.Check-out went smoothly, we were able to extend our check-out until 2pm, which was good as we were tired and didn't need to leave for the airport until 2:00.All-in-all, this is a Holiday Inn - which seems, to me, to have gone downhill in recent years. You can get rooms at very similar prices at almost any hotel on the wharf if you look around.

<Content>Great location for families Could find nothing wrong with this hotel.Room size was good with 2 x queen size beds for 4 of us (2 adults and 2 children). Bathroom was excellent. Also very quiet considering our room was at street level.Internet access via 2 computers near the lobby.Continental breakfast was adequate.Plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, including those at Fisherman's Whart. Starbucks just around the corner.Safe and easy to get around at night.Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone. Definitely on our list of places to stay again.

<Content>We liked it!! We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The staff at the reception deskwas friendly and helpful. We got maps and informations about SF when we checked in. No problem with our luggage to storeas we were there before check-in-time (3 p.m.). Our room was nice and clean and size was o.k.,too. We did not have a view but who needs a view in SF when in town all day long...Wi-Fi was free.We liked the free beakfast. Plenty to choose from.The location was just perfect: minutes from Fishermans Wharf,close to cable car stop, a Trader Joes was around the corner (weloved it!) plenty of restaurants and shopping possibilities. There is a pool at the HI next door which can be used fromguests of the HI express, too.We were glad the we stayed st the Wharf. Yes, it is a tourist area,but aren麓t we tourists?

<Content>Great Location  We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for 3 nights and was very impressed.The room was a good size and was very clean and tidy. Excellent breakfast - my boys loved the doughnuts  pastries on offer. Excellent location and only a short walk to Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39. Great area for kids and felt safe walking around at night. We enjoyed our stay in San Francisco and would have liked to have stayed longer.

<Content>Could not be more pleased! The hotels offered by my travel agent were booked full. I found this hotel on tripadvisor.com and had my agent book it after I read the reviews. My wife and I spent only two days in SF and were pleased to find the reviews to be right on. Hotel is in the Fisherman's Wharf close to Cable Trolleys, Pier 39, shopping, bars, dining, city wide transportation, and site seeing. We had a great time and were able to do everything on our list.

<Content>just ideal we stayed here for just 2 nights but would have been happy to spend a week.If this hotel was in London it would getat least 4 stars.The rooms are absolutely spotless,bathrooms are large with really great showers and loads of lovely fluffy towels.The complimentary breakfasts are fine,excellent doughnuts of real american proportions! Staff were very helpful,I had a problem getting hold of our car hire firm so the receptionist did it for me with a smile. The hotel is an easy walk to Fishermans Wharf and to the tour bus stop.This hotel is ideal as an introduction to both San Francisco and to America,no standing on ceremony,relaxed and above all courteous.

<Content>Great base for the San Fran tourist! This a a great base for a San Fran vacation. We stayed here for one nite before transferring across the street to the Hyatt for a conference. We preferred this hotel, hands down! Staff was warm and accomodating. Rooms were well-sized and comfortable. As a Priority Club member we were upgraded to a suite with a microwave and refridgerator. Rooms were very clean with comfortable beds. Our check out was delayed for 10 minutes and were offered a free movie for the inconvenience (without asking..) Cable car stop is steps from the hotel, as well as Fisherman's wharf, Pier 39, Giardelli Square and sweeping views of the Bay, Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Highly recommended.

<Content>Comfy Room Stayed there for 4 nights as part of my California coast trip. Hotel itself is nice, rooms big and comfortable. Continental breakfast served from 6.30 to 9.30 its a cold buffet with tea.coffee, juices and cereal toast , pastries etc... i thought it was good. The location is in fisherman wharf which is the touristy spot, it was very handy for us as we went to see Alcatraz and the Golden Gate bridge. Plus you can go downtown in 10 minutes. I really liked it but i think i d rather go into downtown next time i visit for a better choice of bars and restaurants. But apart from the location i really enjoyed my stay there.

<Content>Central to eveyrthing Friendly staff, quick check in. We had the building around the corner, but not too much of a trek. Room big, good air conditioning. Beds big and very comfortable with a pillow system, you get a choice of 4 different types of pillows, just pick the one you like.Good to have coffee and tea facilities but did not supply enough as we brits like our tea, did not use their cafe, but found a couple of great breakfast places just up the road towards the cable terminal, they do every breakfast you can imagine, service was friendly and very reasonable, could sit outside, enjoy the early morning sunshine and enjoy a leisurely breakfast. Great view of the bridge from the cable terminal, everything close by, loads of shops and the Piers. The bus tours are within a block and are very informative and interesting.Had a great stay, would stay again.

<Content>Worth it! Overall, very good and we would stay again. Good points - rooms, cleaning, continental breakfasts, location, swimming pool (in Holiday Inn next door) and reception.  Poor points - lifts (slow) and coffee facilities in room. Why a coffee percolator and in the en suite?! Only enough coffee/milk/sugar for one maybe 2 cups. Overcome by 'borrowing' tea bags, milk and sugar from breakfast. Why not get the coffee in rooms right?No homeless seen in area. Excellent location for Fishermans and transport to other parts of city.Overall, very happy.

<Content>Great Location They say location is everything. In the case of the H.I Express at Fisherman's Wharf this is very true. My wife and I just returned from a four night stay there. Everything is within a short walking distance. The Wharf is a block away, the cable cars are another block away, the famous F line is also a block away. Our room was facing the street but we had no problem with noise. The staff was very nice and helpful, even in giving directions. If there was a down side, I would have to say, the room is bit on the small side and pricey. However, it is adaquate and clean. We would definately go back.

<Content>Great location and clean hotel I love the location for this hotel in San Francisco. You do not need to rent a car because you have all the transportation around you needed at all times of the day and night. We also took numerous tours which picked us up in front of the hotel. If you decide to rent a car the rate per night at the hotel w/tax is approx. $42.00. The Holiday Inn Express is very clean and unusually large and soundproof. The beds should be upgraded because they have seen many years of abuse. We used our points and did not have to pay anything and were put in a mini suite which included a fridge and microwave. The view was of the Wharf from our room but being we were on the run the entire week it was a pleasure to come back and leave from that location. The breakfast could be better and maybe more of it being you have a lot of people from other countries who took advantage of filling bags for dessert - I blame this on all of San Francisco who charge ridiculous prices for all food especially breakfast. I was told Denny's around the corner charged for 3 people an average of $72.00. New York is much cheaper than this City. Also, the homeless are out of control every place you walk in the best of areas they are begging, trying to touch you and sleeping in the streets. In fact they are out of control and make it very uncomfortable because no police and very little security around. They are even outside of the hotels but I felt fine because I had my husband and 15 year old son with me. If I was alone it would not be enjoyable. When you stand on the line for the Trolley Cars they are grabbing on to you and begging. Every park, every landmark, every place there are tons and tons of them even sleeping on the Trolly's before they roll out in the AM. I was interested in taking one of the Trolley's and stepped on the bus because I thought one of them worked for the transit and almost got cornered by 4 of them until my husband came behind me. This City is NOT SAFE for single women. I think they need to stop protecting them and clean up San Francisco because it is a beautiful place to visit. Everyone we met felt the same way in fact one women from England went to the baseball Giant Game the same night we attended and 3 of these homeless men sat next to them and every time they moved the homeless followed them until one fell and split open his chin and was bleeding but refused help and paramedics left the scene. I called them bums and almost got my head chopped off by many of the tour guides that we took trips with. One place we stopped to take a picture I walked with my son ahead of my husband and he felt someone right behind him when he picked up the bag that we were carrying and thought it was me but instead had a homeless right in his face. If people would stop visiting they would have no choice but to do something about it.

<Content>Did the job nicely! We stayed here as part of a two day stay in San Fran and have to say it was perfect for what we were after, Close to Fisherman's wharf  Pier 39, the vintage tram (a must!) which takes you to the shopping haven that is union square, and also close to the alcatraz ferry (one of the highlights of our 2 week stay in the US!).The hotel itself was well presented  felt modern. Apart from the poor view from our room, I was pleased with it overall, the free wireless was a bonus and the complementary continental breakfast hit the spot. All in all I would definitley recommend this hotel for a short stay in San Fran.

<Content>Good Location,nice,clean hotel Just returned from our 2nd trip in as many years to wonderful,diverse San Francisco. Can not wait to plan another trip to my favorite city in the country! Stayed at Holiday Inn Express Fisherman's Wharf.We like staying in the wharf area so chose this hotel . The hotel is located close to anything you need. Stores, shops,food, the wharf, Ghiradelli, the Cannery. great area. The hotel was very clean. plenty of room to move around in our room, and very helpful friendly staff. We had requested a refridge in the room (daughter's dietary needs). When we got checked in and arrived in the room there wasn't a fridge. Called the front desk and within minutes one was delivered to the room. Have only positive comments concerning the staff and front desk.Back to the room, the beds were comfortable, everything looked fairly new and nice bath products left every day.The maid service was good. Funny thing not once~never ,saw a maid, maids cart or any sign of them our entire stay. Rooms had always been cleaned by the time we returned from our days excursions.The only negative I can think of is there was absolutlely no view from our room. It was an inner quiet room as we requested, but our only view wasa wall of other rooms. Maybe if we stayed on the highest floor (4 I think) may have had a view. The street side rooms may have a view, but they are very noisy with traffic. Wasn't a huge deal as we use the room only for cleaning up and sleeping. Just compared to a different hotel we stayed previous vacation. Watched Alcatraz, the water every morning with my coffee..So, probably unfair to compare. The free cont. breakfast was adequate.If you want fresh, cooked to order breakfast, there are several places within steps of the hotel.I feel if it's free nobody has a right to complain.All in all I feel for the price this was the best deal we could have found. Have no complaints about the hotel itself or the staff. We had a great time.

We had a great view of the ocean..alcatraz and even the top of the golden gate bridge. Our room was extremely neat and clean each and everyday. The bed made, carpet cleaned, bathroom sparkling. The breakfast was a wonderful way to start the day of sight seeing. It was always busy and always well stocked. Internet access throught their computers was fast and we were even able to print directions. Checking out was a breeze. We stayed nine nights and we can't wait to stay again!!!!Bob and Donna...Tn fans in the land of the golden hotel

<Content>Steps to Wharf One night stop over only. First timers for 4 of our party of 6. Steps from the Wharf and all the night life you need. Great food vendors and shopping along walk to Pier 39. Clean rooms. Courteous front desk workers. Valet parkers excellent, with no wait in the a.m. when leaving! No views except to other rooms, but we hardly spent any time in our room except to sleep. AC worked well, as it was HOT when we were there. Shower water pressure was okay. Continental breakfast was great, with oatmeal, coffee/tea/hot chocolate/juice, toast, danish, cereals, muffins, apples  oranges. Quick check out available. Would stay here again, and recommend to others. No pool was disappointing!

<Content>Perfect For A Short Stay - Ideal Location We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express with Virgin Holidays. It was only a three night stay so for this reason the hotel was fine. The room was large and the beds confortable. We stayed in one room with our 2 children and had ample space. It is in a fantastic location for getting around San Francisco. The bed linen was clean and a maid service was supplied every day. We did not have the included continental breakfast as we chose to eat at the Denny's around the corner. We had a lot of help from the desk staff who advised us about how to get around and the best plass to visit and how to get there. Just a suggestion you must visit Alcatras and book tickets at home as it is normally fully booked when you go to buy tickets on the dock on the day.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay.. Stayed at the Holiday Inn for 4 nights this February. On arrival we were put in a smoking room to which I complained as neither me, my husband or my 6yr old smoked. Virgin apparently just allocated smoking rooms to families beware of this. Anyway was given another room straight away. Room was nice. Nothing to get excited about. The location of this hotel is brilliant though. We ate breakfast in the hotel lobby and also across the road at the Denny's located in the adjacent building. Both were OK. On check out there was a problem with a parking charge, which we were told by Virign when booking would be free. The hotel apparently didn't know anything about this. Let us off though in the end. I would recommend this hotel, we had a nice stay. San Francisco is BRILLIANT....

<Content>Stay away from Dennys Stayed in H. Inn this july, hotel in good location, decent size rooms etc. We were in the second building across the street where there is a 'Dennys' situatedStay away from 'Dennys' as it is daylight robbery. ...Basic breakfast for 2 adults+1 child consisting of coffee, toast, ceral, fruit etc approx $45-50. Much better to try the 'Latte Express' deli across the road on Beach street. Great selection of cereals, juices, sandwiches, excellent coffee etc to stay or go to suit families either on a budget or those that don't like getting ripped off.Go through the sliding doors beside the concierge desk onto the street and latte express is across the road on your right hand side.

<Content>Great Budget Hotel We stayed here for a few days in November 2006 and had a really nice stay. The hotel is in a great location in which to explore Fishermans Wharf and is a few minutes walk to the main attractions. The rooms are ample and reasonably furnished. The staff are ok , although the breakfast bar can get crowded and is a little messy.

<Content>Best Buy near Fisherman's Wharf I have clients with offices near Fisherman's Wharf and must check up on them several times each year. After trying all the alternatives, I've settled on the Holiday Inn Express as the best place to stay in the area.The room cost is reasonable. The rooms are clean and set up for a business traveller (free high-speed internet, and a decent desk).I've only stayed in a room with a street view once, with all other rooms facing interior courtyards. The good news is that these rooms are quiet, while the street view rooms have heavy traffic noice. The bad news is that there is no view in a city famous for great views.Holiday Inn Express offers the same breakfast at every property I've stayed at. It gets the job done, but don't expect anything fancy. Coffee, cold cereal, toaster waffles/english muffins, cinamon rolls, and an orange colored liquid that claims to be juice.If you are driving a car, be prepared to pay a $40 daily charge to park it at the hotel. High priced parking is pretty standard at all San Francisco hotels, but can be a shocker if you aren't prepared for it.Want a restaurant recommendation? Try Pompei's Grotto. It's about 2 blocks away, just West of the zooey part of Fisherman's Wharf. Good seafood at a reasonable price. If you are searching for a fantastic mega-meal with a view, McCormick  Kuleto's in Ghiradelli Square is the best.

<Content>Pick room off of the street We picked this for its convenient location. The first night was hell for me, a light sleeper. It was on the first floor, 10 feet from a trolley line and busy street. The night lobby manager was awful. I went to get a quieter room at 6 am after a sleepless night and he refused to make a change for our next two booked nights. He said I'd have to wait until 11 when rooms had been checked out of. At 8 am the day reservations clerk, a young woman named Ady came on duty. SHE immediately changed our room to a quiet inner one. It was an unused handicap room we could get into immediately. If we wanted to wait, she even offered to later put us into a suite. We took the first room because we had to get to Berkeley by 9 am and it worked out great.Why can't a chain like Holiday Inn train all its staff to be kind and accommodating like Ady? The first guy makes me want to never book a Holiday Inn again.The hotel was in a great location to get around to all the sites, though the streets were extremely crowded during summer vacation. We didn't take the cable car nearby because of huge lines.The free breakfast was adequate - all cold foods but lots of fruits, breads, pastries  cereals, hard boiled eggs and beverages. The lobby and rooms are clean and modern.You have no fridge, microwave or exercise room (3 treadmills was it), but for sleeping and central location for touristing, it was fine (if you get an inner room).
