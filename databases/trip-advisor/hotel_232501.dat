<Content>Loved this Hotel Have stayed at this hotel 3 or 4 times now and it is very good. We stayed in a triple room at the front and I did not hear any noise. The room was comfortable and warm with a nice view of one of the canals. Breakfast is not bad - cereal, toast, cheese, meat, eggs, tea, coffee, juice. It is self service, open from 0700 - 1000 hrs. Can't understand why they want cheese and cold ham for breakfast mind you but there is plenty of it.Staff are friendly and remember us each time we go.Would most definitely stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful location  We stayed here 3 nights in October and had a wonderful time. The staff was extremely friendly during check-in and we were very pleased with the room. Everything was very neat and clean, although the bathroom was a little strange :) There was no separator between the shower floor and the bathroom floor...just a shower curtain that kept the spraying water all in one area. As long as you realize this before you turn on the water and pick up your clothing off the bathroom floor first it's not an issue at all. There was great hot water and water pressure and a hair dryer in the bathroom, so don't bother bringing one with you.Breakfast in the morning was a typical European breakfast with bread, cold cuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt, juice and tea. We had it the first morning but the second morning we went out to one of the numerous cafes that serves English breakfast and had eggs, toast, and bacon.The location of the hotel is what made it really worth it. It's only a few blocks walking distance from the train station and right on the edge of the Jordaan. We were able to comfortably walk to the Anne Frank house, the Red Light District, and the Flower District. The street itself is quiet and the hotel overlooks a canal. We were given a room that overlooks the canal and also backs up to the elevator shaft. We thought this might be a problem but we never heard a thing. They have free wireless internet and the pay movies are also free so you get a few extras for your money.When you leave the hotel you leave your key at the front desk but, as a security measure, they give you a card that you have to show to get your key back. I really liked that :) The staff was always pleasant and when we checked out they gave us a free package of tulip bulbs!We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Just awesome hotel!!!!!! Stayed there for one night in the summer of 2007. Got a superb price for a double room on the first floor just opposite the canals. Great view!! Friendly staff, great location in Amsterdam. Very clean rooms and nice beds with 45 channels on the tv. Just found it superb and friendly. Will stay there again!!

<Content>A little slice of Amsterdam I was a bit concerned about booking the Singel after reading some of the reviews. After a three night stay at the hotel, I'd like to keep some of those reviews posted, as it may put some people off and leave the Singel to those willing to take a chance!I'd booked an en suite room, and after the initial surprise of finding it much longer than it was wide, I quite liked it. The bed was comfortable, the desk with chair and reading light were great, and the en suite quite sufficient for my needs. The safe was a nice plus and not really difficult to operate, although I did practise with it empty before placing my valuables inside.Staff were kind - the woman at Reception offered me a cup of coffee at check in when I said I'd been on the go for nine hours - nice. The hotel was kept clean, both in the common areas and bedrooms. Breakfast was quite tasty, with a good selection of food and of course a pot of delicious Dutch coffee to go with...mmm.Centraal is not more than a ten minute walk from the hotel, handy for those wishing to take the train to and from Schiphol. Overall I had a pleasant stay in Amsterdam, and very much enjoyed putting up at the Singel.

<Content>Great Hotel We are a couple from Bergen, Norway and we stayed at the picturesque Singel Hotel last week. Because the hotel is situated right in the middle of the city centre at one of the canals of Amsterdam and the buildings along these canals are hundreds of years old we didn't expect a modern, spacious hotel. When we make a citytrip we prefer to book a hotel which offers a local atmosphere in stead of for example a 400 rooms Hilton Hotel which looks completely the same in every city...Indeed our room was not spacious but it was clean. The location is perfect (only a few minutes from central station) and the friendly staff, magnificent hospitality and great services like free wifi and free in-house movies are much better then average hotels (so far I always had to pay for internet access). When you ask the people at the reception for information they do everything to help you. The places they recommended us were really great. Especially the 鈥淛ordaan鈥?area was outstanding! Here you will find the caf茅鈥檚 and restaurants the locals are going to (everywhere non-smoking as from July 1st!). And only ten minutes from the hotel.So, our overall experience of the Singel Hotel is very good. If you expect swimming pools, wellness centres and giant rooms you鈥檒l better book a Hilton Hotel. But why you go to Amsterdam anyway ? If you want to book a hotel in Amsterdam which make you feel like a local for a few days, go to Singel Hotel!!

<Content>Choose something else We stayed there just one night, didn't book hotel in advance so relied on some tourist agency near train station and they booked it for us. Location is good, the hotel had some bad smell and it looked pretty worn out inside, the room was very small, well, clean but you still feel like you are in a hostel. The bathroom was also very small and looked old. In the morning we asked the guy (at the reception) if we can have breakfast 10-15 minutes earlier breakfast time (we needed to catch train), i understand he is not obliged to say - yes. But he was so indifferent to our request and kind of rude. It was very unpleasant. Don't waste your money! There are much better hotels in Amsterdam.

<Content>Liked it a lot After reading some of the recent reviews of the Singel, and having made my booking over six months earlier based on the good reviews on Tripadvisor, I approached my visit with some caution.However, all my fears were allayed once we arrived.It was very easy to locate and get to once we had arrived at the central train station from the airport. Less than 10 minutes walk (even with luggage) in a quiet street alongside the Singel canal.I had requested two non-smoking rooms with canal views (I suspect most people ask for canal views!). On arrival we had been allocated a single room with canal view and a double room (with a view of the house next door!).The canal room view did smell of smoke, but after a short time with the window open (all the better to see the nice view) this soon cleared.The double room was marked on the hotel plan as a smoking room, but there was no smell of it in there at all.The rooms were not so much small as narrow - and I've stayed in much smaller rooms in the USA most notably in New York However, for the price, which is a bargain for the central location in Amsterdam this was fine - anyway, its a hotel room, so long as the bed is comfy, how much time are you actually going to spend in there anyway?The hotel is (fairly in my opinion) listed as a three star establishment - we found it clean and comfortable.Some of the fixtures and fittings were a little worn, but again, this wasn't a problem. TThe TV has many channels to watch, including many English language ones (many Dutch channels seem to show English programmes with Dutch subtitles), plus three free film channels. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. Always available for advice on somewhere to go to eat (try Humphreys 5 minutes walk away - the service is `relaxed` to say the least, but the three course meal for 20.50 euros is absolutely excellent)or for directions.One reviewer thought that the red light district seemed to have reached this area - not quite true (That's still more than half a mile away on the other side of town). However, there are quite a few `Red Light Window Brothels` on the same street and nearby - however, again, this shouldn't be a problem to most visitors. If you're worried about the very open attitudes to sex and drugs, then Amsterdam is not the place for you.Another reviewer complained about the `complex` instructions for the in-room safe. I can only say that I've seen and used identical safes in hotel rooms all over the world and have never had a problem - certainly didn't with this one either.The buffet style breakfast was typical of most mid-range budget european hotels - just right to get you set up for the day.All in all a problem free , happy and comfortable stay.

<Content>this is not a 3 star Hotel , it is a 0 star Do not stay at this Hotel..it is a dump,it's dirty. The place needs painting, it smells of smoke.Definately not worth the money. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. We spent three weeks in Europe and this place was our only disappointment.

<Content>Not Great Stayed here for 3 nights based on traveller reviews. Kind of disappointing. Staff was friendly but only if you agreed to everything they provided. Booked the room 3 months ago and requested a non smoking room canal view. Checked in and I can understand no canal view but they gave us a tiny worn out, smoking room in the basement. The room stunk and the lady was really upset when I requested a non smoking room at least above basement level. Compared to the basement I was happy with the new room despite mould in bathroom and everything extremely frayed and worn.  She said they were busy but reluctantly moved us to an upper floor. I can see them being busy but the were not full and they save the nicer rooms, canal view to tempt the walk in clients (happened to hear this conversation as I walked past front desk). Screwed up the safe (ridicuously complex instructions) and after the room change the lady really got upset when she had to open the room safe for me. I noticed each time I was in the lobby someone was asking to have their room safe opened- was not just me as she would have me believe (another guest showed sympathy after she scolded me out and said the same thing happened to them) . Other staff were much friendlier. It was not the canal house experience I had hoped for. Next time I will look for pictures of the room. There is a good reason why there pictures just show things like the number on the door.

<Content>Singel Biggest Mistake I was in Amsterdam this past week for a few night stay celebrating a birthday and chose to stay at the Singel because it appeared, from the reviews, to be exactly what I was looking for: a clean place with a great location. While the location was ok, not great and will never stay in that area of Amsterdam again, the hotel was the worst hotel I have ever seen. There are hostels that are nicer and cleaner. This hotel claims to have 3 stars, well I would give it 0.Upon entering the hotel you can see that the downstairs area has not been updated since the 70's and most likely not really cleaned since then either. When I entered my room I almost got sick. The carpet was old, worn and had many stains, as did the walls. The bathroom was so small that the sink was acutally in the shower are. Now I know that bathrooms tend to be smaller in Europe, I lived there for 6 months, but this was ridiculous. In addition, the bedding had not been washed and I had to ask for it to be changed (which they were fighting as the maid had gone for the day). Even after the beddding was changed to supposedly new sheets their still remained hairs and other discusting matter on the sheets and blanket. There is nothing chic, hip, or clean about this hotel. After one night I left. The only reason I stayed for one night is that there were not hotel rooms left in the city. If is was not so cold, I would have slept on the streets!Be warned this is a DUMP!

<Content>Good for Budget Travellers. We stayed at this hotel for two nights during a city break to Amsterdam. The location of the hotel is good and easy to find. Its not far from the train station and but out the way if the red light district if you want to avoid that!The service at the reception was good and we had a pleasant stay. However if you want a 5* hotel room this hotel isn't for you. The rooms were very basic and nothing special but they were very clean although they were basic there is nothing to complain about. If you just want a budget break with a room to stay this hotel is excellent.

<Content>A Gem! What a gem! All those people who complain about it being small have no idea what a premium space is in Europe. My room (22) was clean and spacious and the desk manager apologised for it not having a view but you could actually still see the water sitting at the desk. Wifi worked perfectly, breakfast (provided) was pretty goodI had an exceptional experience at this hotel and am very pleased with my find.

<Content>Good value for money Stayed here from March 2nd - 5th. It is about a 10 minute walk from the station and very easy to find. Check in staff were welcoming and friendly and we were given Room 34 which overlooked the canal (as we had requested by e-mail). The room was small but adequate - the bathroom was tiny and reminded me of a caravan bathroom. There was no shower tray, just a drain hole in the floor but it seemed to work quite well.The hotel is very central, near the station, canal cruises etc. Lots of restaurants in the vicinity - try Spuistraat for the best choice, although we had a fantastic meal in the De Belhamel in Brouwersgracht which was only a 4 minute walk away. There is also a tapas bar just down the street which did nice food but was very smokey (that will change after the smoking ban in July though).One thing which did surprise us a bit were the number of red light windows in the street and also sidestreets off the Singel. My husband reckoned I had booked us into a hotel in the red light district!! They didn't bother us but I reckon if you were there with young children it could be a bit awkward to explain to them. The Hotel Brouwer just down the street (which I nearly booked instead of the Singel) even had one next door.However, it was a good hotel, decent breakfasts and friendly polite staff and I would recommend it for its location and lovely views.

<Content>Tipical Amsterdam feeling, nice price, perfect location This is a very typical Amsterdam hotel, chic and small. I really do not understand those (mostly US) complains about the size of the hotel! It is a typical Amsterdam hotel, where space, amazingly, IS limited and damn expensive (unlike North US). So there is either the choice of staying downtown for a good price, close to everything you can imagine (from Bulldog Bar to Red Light District, shopping and museums area) OR pay 500 a night and stay 20km further, close to airport, with a great view of the landing area. Mention the Receptionist you want a room with canal view. otherwise you might end up with 35 or 36 for example, that face the wall. But this is the dutch experience. Breakfast is very good, with a good choice of cheese, jams, hams, bacons, eggs, milk, coffee, tee and cereals. Bathrooms are indeed small (compared to home standards) but again, this is Netherlands and this is a normal sized bathroom (and I've seen enough of that country, considering that my spouse is dutch). Don't forget to pick up the discount tickets in front of the elevators for the museums. WiFi is included, normally is a paper in the room with the key (or ask the front desk).

<Content>Be Very Careful! This is aimed particularly at North American potential guests, who may make the same mistake I made. I was booked to stay at the Hotel Singel on October 23rd 2007, as a layover enroute from Vancouver to Johannesburg. I booked the Singel because of reviews in Tripadvisor, and because my other choices were full. Two days before I was due to leave Vancouver, KLM cancelled my flight KL682, and routed me on NWA through Seattle instead so that an overnight stopover in Amsterdam was no longer required. I immediately e-mailed the Hotel Singel reservations desk to advise them of my need to cancel. I was shocked to then receive a response that I would be charged the full amount, even though I advised them a full 44 hours ahead of their deadline! In fact, I gave them 58 hours of notice ahead of their stated check-in time of 2 pm.So here's the warning, especially to travellers from North America, where hotels will, almost without exception, accept cancellations within 24 hours of check-in. Hotel Singel's website is quite clear that the notice required is 48 hours, but NOT FROM CHECK-IN TIME. Rather, it is timed from 00.00 on the day of check-in! The website quotes check-in as 2 pm, so in fact you must give 62 hours of notice to avoid being charged the full amount.I exchanged e-mails with the reservations manager, a Mr. Peter Verweij, who politely told me that I had not provided the requisite notice, and therefore nothing could be done. I offered to negotiate some percentage of the nightly rate, but my e-mail was ignored.Obviously, I will never deal with organization again, and I hope at least one person reading this chooses not to stay at this hotel. I think their business practices are unreasonable, and although I agree that their policy is posted (and I read it), I think demanding 62 hours of notice prior to check-in is ridiculous, especially since the itinerary change was not of my making.Finally, I did notify Mr. Verweij ahead of time that I would be posting this on Tripadvisor, Easytobook, etc so that others may learn from my mistake, and still he chose to make no amends. Hopefully the lost business will be worth the $150 he took from me.

<Content>Staff and Location was great First time in Amsterdam and I will be back. I liked the proximity of this hotel to Centraal Station. My Mom and I went to Brussels, then to Zaanse Schaans in different days. We walked from the Singel hotel to Centraal. It was also convenient for us with our 22inch luggage to drag to Centraal on to the final leg of our vacation to Paris Nord.The rooms are typically small, but was adequate enough. We also enjoyed breakfast. The staff gives you a carafe of coffee to enjoy. This hotel is near the tram, Pancake Bakery, Anne Frank's House.

<Content>Perfect for a girly weekend!!! We booked the Singel hotel on easytobook.com. We were on a girly weekend, there were three of us and the room we got was perfect. As far as I remember it was room 33 which overlooked the canal. There was scafolidng and net up at the time we were there which was a pity we could not see the view but it did not bother us. Room was spacious and clean, exactly what we were looking for.It ws very central but also out of the way of the centre of things enough that it was not noisy at night...maybe a little lonely sometimes walking home late at night but just keep your wits about you. The only negative thing I could say about the hotel was that you could hear almost everything in the rooms next and above you, for example, I could hear everything in the bathroom upstairs and one night when we came in late and were talking our neighbours were banging on the wall! But it didn't ruin the trip, I would defo stay in this hotel again and would even consider staying with my boyfriend.

<Content>Great!! I really dont understand how people can have a bad experience with this hotel, the one thing that made it such a nice place was the staff, they are sooo friendly!! The room was average size for amsterdam, the breakfast very nice, usual toast, ham, cheese, jam etc, and the place was very clean. Im going back there this year and will definately stay there again.

<Content>romantic getaway Perfect for our wedding anniversary. We were given room 40, a double room in the fourth floor, which had an unexpected good view on both the circular church and the canal (the other double rooms are all on the church side). The man at reception said that room was called 'the love nest', since it is quite isolated from the other rooms, therefore very quiet.Good comfort, though small space, esp.in the bathroom. Still it was not a problem for us.We really do not regret having stayed at the Singel... which was so much better than the AmstelBotel that we were supposed to come down to initially. It was cosy, clean, romantic, and worth it. One last thing: breakfast was included in the price, and provided excellent choice of food and drinks. I particularly appreciated the black cereal bread and the cumin gouda slices, but there was also muesli and yoghurt, raisin brioche, various toasts and spreads... a good mixture of Dutch and classic breakfast. To conclude, an excellent place to stay, easy to reach, close to the station and the other nice districts of the town.

<Content>The Worst Ever Just returned from staying at this hotel and it was the worst experience during my 3 week trip to Europe. Although it posts as a 3 star hotel it was more like a 1 star, if that. As I occupied a single room it was small, cramped and dirty. Mold on the bathroom walls and the smell of chemicals in trying to remove that mold. If you opened your window to not smell chemicals you smelled smoke from someone in another room blowing out their window. It was dirty and old. I would not recommend staying here.

<Content>A real gem! We have just returned from a short break in Amsterdam (28th - 30th May 2007) and booked this hotel purely on the strength of the reviews from this site.Singel Hotel is a gem of a hotel - clean, friendly and well situated.We stayed in rooms 23 and 16. Room 16 overlooked the canal and it was a nice size - and very clean. The bathroom had the standard gels and shower caps - there was a bath with overhead shower with plenty of hot water. The beds were extremely comfortable, duvets and nice quality white linen.I visited Amsterdam with my elderly mother, and she was extremely satisfied with this hotel - the location was very good.Within a short stroll were lots of different restaurants and taking various short cuts we were in Dam Square within a few minutes.Room 16 is a single room, and again considering the price, more than adequate.The breakfast was typical of Holland, and both plentiful and fresh.Book this hotel with complete confidence - I would not hesitate to recommend it. Pricewise it really is outstanding.

<Content>Very disappointing A modest, clean hotel, well located, but we were given a small, dark room on the back, with a window looking onto a cement wall just 3 feet away. Nothing else available in the hotel.

<Content>Not great... Hotel rooms were very small, not enough room to swing a cat. Clean enough though. View of canal was good and all hotel desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast included but minimal and not very nice. No internet available at hotel which was annoying. Breakfast service staff were rude and unfriendly. Probably wouldn't return.

<Content>brilliant hotel we stayed at the singel on the 14 april 07, the hotel is lovely and clean,with very helpful and friendly staff , comfy beds with clean sheets and pillows and a clean bathroom with clean towels and shower gel and shampoo provided, breakfast was lovely boiled eggs rolls toast coffee and tea with cream cereal juices fruitbread cheeses hams etc on a buffett so u can get as much as you want , were able to leave our luggage untill we had to leave for the train station which saved us carrying it around all morning, the hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the station,the only negative is that we paid 拢320 for a 3 night stay and we had to order coffee and tea as there were none in the rooms when the tea and coffee came the cups were very very very small and they were 拢1.75 per cup i think the tea and coffee should be included in ther room price but apart from that the hotel is perfect i would stay here again

<Content>Ideal location Myself and 3 of my girlfriends are just back from a fantastic trip to Amsterdam..The Singel hotel was more than adequate for our 4 night stay..Ideal location only literally 5 mins walk from Central station and from Dam Square...We stayed in room 33 which had 2 single beds pushed together and one other single bed on the other side of the room..The beds were so comfortable and the bathroom shower was very powerful and water was always hot..Towels were changed daily, the only gripe we had that the window would not stay open but we rectified this ourselves with a book..We had a fab canal view from the room, breakfast was continental buffet style, more than adequate and we found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. Will definitely be coming back here..There is a gorgeous tapas bar 2 mins walk from the hotel too.

<Content>Small Rooms but otherwise very good! Stayed the week before easter. Staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast was the usual buffet style but well presented.Great location only 5 minutes walk from train station and all the main touristy stuff. However if you like spacious rooms stay elsewhere... we were given a room on the third floor which was clean and functional but very small. Otherwise you'll have a nice stay.

<Content>Very average As with many small city hotels it depends which room you get as to how well you rate the experience. Having seen another couple of rooms we feel we were lucky to get our room (no 24) as it was bigger, brighter and faced the canal. Having said that it was still small, especially the bathroom which also was unheated. The bathroom also smelled of bad drains when you ran the water. The breakfast room and food served was OK, but they could have done better with a little more effort. The staff were friendly and the hotel location was good, though the red light district has now expanded into this part of town. From past experience there are better hotels in Amsterdam that are of a similar price.

<Content>Singel is more than adequate We have just returned from our stay at the Singel Hotel which I booked because it was recommended by friends.It is in a great location, walking distance from the station and most of the sights.We had room 16 which I booked as a double but was in fact a triple with twins pushed together and also a fold up third single. The third bed made the room cramped and I could have asked for it to be moved but as we were only ther for 2 nights I didn't bother. The room was on the first floor overlooking the canal.The bathroom was clean, the hot water was plentiful and very hot, towels were white and nice and fluffy. Make sure you put the shower curtain inside the bath or the water goes all over. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom.There was a tv in the room which had a english news chanel but I didn't look for anything else.The breakfast consisted of cereal, boiled eggs, cold meats, sliced cheese, yoghurts, jams, sliced white and brown bread, rolls, panetonne, fresh oranges, fruit juice, tea and coffee. There was a toaster to make your own toast.The only drawback was you could smoke in the rooms and the smell tended to permeate onto the landings and other rooms.There is a great pub/ bar on the corner down the street which is opposite some red light windows but it is not a seedy area.I would go back as it was very good value for money but I would only recommend it as a base for sightseers who are out and about most of the time. It is not for romantics or honeymooners.

<Content>would definitely recommend We stayed at the Singel Hotel at the end of February 2007 and thought it was great. Really convenient location, clean, comfortable rooms, good breakfast, very helpful and friendly staff.We booked it based on trip advisor reviews which were all very accurate.Had a lovely time (despite the constant rain!) and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nice central hotel. Being a 17th century building, we were not expecting the hotel to be like the Ritz, and were prepared for the small rooms, so-so bathrooms and lots of little quirks, and as we were only there for one night it was never going to devastate us if things were a bit less than perfect. Having said that, it is fair to warn others who may be staying longer that there are some things worth considering. Looking back on others reviews, I would say that the vast majority of comments are very accurate and I would say look closely at them and see if anything commented on is a 'deal breaker' for you.We were in room 40, which is situated at attic level involving going outdoors over a small section of flat roof to reach the room. It was slippery due to damp weather and if you are at all infirm or intend to go out drinking while you are there, request in advance that you are not given this room. The previous reviewers have comprehensively covered the main issues with this hotel. There is no soundproofing between rooms and we couldn't get to sleep due to a noisy group who talked, laughed, argued, and in the childrens case, whined, long after bedtime. It was loud enough that if we had wished we could have chatted with them without raising our voices much. Be warned...take earplugs just in case you are an 'early to bed, early to rise' type. The room itself was warm and clean and the bed was very comfortable, but the bathroom in number 40 is horrible, very damp with mouldy tile grout. The bathroom itself, other than needing some serious work on the grout, was adequate and was otherwise clean with a good hot shower.My children stayed in room 42, which was at the front of the hotel, again at attic level, and had a nicer bathroom. They all commented on the comfortable beds.As commented elsewhere, the staff are amongst the nicest I have ever come across in a hotel, and were extremely accommodating. Breakfast was more than adequate and everything appeared to be fresh. I would stay in this hotel again as it is very central and in a quiet street without a lot of hubub. The aforementioned prostitutes in the window at the other end of the street do exist but, hey, it is Amsterdam and it is not a sign that you are in a bad and dangerous area. One word of caution for car drivers. There is metered parking on the street, but if you overstay your time, they do clamp in Amsterdam, as parking spots are at an absolute premium.

<Content>Great hotel, great location - definitely recommended Just got back from a long weekend in Amsterdam, staying at the Singel Hotel which was top notch, and seen as I used trip advisor to book the hotel l I thought I'd write a review for it too!Its a lovely cosy (small-ish) hotel in a great location. really close (bout 5 minute walk) to central station so no need to have to get in a taxi to get there. Check in was at 2pm but they were really happy to let us leave our bags and pay upfront.We stayed in a triple room which was small but very comfortable - with three single beds and a small bathroom. Seen as we only spent the evenings getting ready and sleeping in the room it was fine. Lovely views over the Singel canal from our room and the breakfast - served from 7am til 10am was standard. No hot food, apart from boiled eggs but plenty of bread, cereal and meats. All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a cheap, but decent hotel in Amsterdam centre!

<Content>good, clean, central hotel We have just recently return from a long weekend at the Singel Hotel. It is a good, clean, unpretentious, reasonably priced central hotel. It is walking distance from the railway station. It is located in a quiet road opposite the canal. It is a great base to explore Amsterdam from. There is a minimum two night stay policy. I paid for the rooms on arrival with my Visa card. I was aware that City Tax was extra - so it was not a shock. Check in 4pm and check out is 12, there is a room to store left luggage.My room did not have a canal view unlike my friends (contact the hotel and request a canal view), but we were only in our room for sleeping, etc. The hotel staff were polite and very helpful. Breakfast was also good (cereals, yoghurts, bread, ham, cheese, boiled eggs,etc.), but they could do with more than one toaster. The bedrooms were not overly spacious, but they were clean. The beds were very comfortable with extra pillows if required. There was a free safe and a TV with same English channels. The bathroom was small but OK - it was basically a wet room (as I have one at home it was not a problem). There was a shower, sink and toilet. There was good water pressure and plenty of hot water (a hairdryer was also provided). It must be remember that the Singel is made up of 3 canal houses - so bathrooms were never going to be big. The rooms were cleaned daily and fresh towels provided. The walls or doors let in some noise, e.g. returning guests at night - but it was not a major problem as I slept well while staying at the Singel. All floors could be accessed using a small lift.The Singel Hotel is central to all the sights (e.g. Anna Frank's House is a ten minute walk) and there are Tram stops nearby. There are also plently of pubs, restaurants, coffeeshops/houses nearby. I would be happy to stay at the Singel Hotel again.

<Content>Loved the Singel!!! First...my boyfriend told me to say that I am very picky when it comes to hotels..very picky!!!! I travel ALOT for work and stay in ALOT of hotels...not an excuse, but maybe a reason........as for the SIngel HOtel --We just returned from two nights at the Singel and I was very impressed! We booked it based on the reviews on this website and all the good things are right! I was worried when they did not have any canal rooms available (I booked this 2 days before arrival), but the room we had was fabulous!!! It was on the side with a nice window view with a little bit of the canal in site. The beds are VERY comfortable with nice duvets and extra pillows. The shower had great water pressure and the room was heated. There is also a safe in the room.All of the staff were lovely and fun. There is someone at the front 24hours, which is very nice. The area is very safe and close to the train station. Also close to some great places for eats and treats! Having stayed in Amsterdam before, I have to say that this is the best hotel I have found. I got a deal online web site - 79Euro including breaky. I have seen places not nearly as nice for more than double that price!Look no more..just book the Singel..you will not be sorry!

<Content>Basic, no frills but satisfactory Spent several nights here based on the largely positive reviews. Pros: quiet but central location just a short walk from the train station and tram stops, comfortable beds with warm soft comforters, above average continental breakfast (with a pleasant array of cheese and cold cuts in addition to the usual toast and juice), very helpful front desk who are eager to offer tips about Amsterdam and eagerly look up info for you on the Internet. Well heated rooms. No street noise at all in back rooms (and I bet the canal side is fairly quiet too as there is hardly any traffic). There is a small elevator. Cons: room (a double) is indeed quite small, and no view in off street rooms (although it is quiet accordingly). our bathroom was so-so in terms of cleanliness (the shower is one end of the bathroom and is not separated by a tub or partition, so water can get all over the floor; there was a musty odor to the shower and curtain). decor is charmless. Smoke (both kinds) and chatter from other rooms often drifted into our room, which happened late at night given a high number of young late night revelers the week we were there (or maybe every week in Amsterdam). Somewhat pricey for what the facilities were, but I guess most central Amsterdam hotels tend to be pricey. Overall an adequate experience, but somewhat disappointing for the money. The helpful staff help make up for the underwhelming facilities.

<Content>pleasant enough Stayed at the Singel for 2 nights for a football trip, the place is easy to find, in a good location, near the station,on the Singel canal, next to a church.Room was comfy and very well heated if a little basic, breakfast was good a variety of cereals, breads, cheese, meats, etc, boiled eggs, juice, teacoffeeAll in all a pleasant enough place for a couple of days, mind you we didnt get to bed until 3:30 the first night and well after 4 on the second.The guy I roomed with works in pest control and was a stickler about vermin  bed bugs etc before we went and he had no complaints unlike some of our other guys who stayed elsewhere in the city so read into that what you will

<Content>Good location, nice staff and clean room Stayed here for a couple of nights. Did ask in advance for a room with canal views but when we arrived was told they were fully booked. Didn't want a room at the back of the hotel due to past reviews. We were given the 'attic' room, 40. It was ok, had a side view of the canal, a bit small but it was clean and had hot water so we were happy. Hotel is in a good location near station and shops etc..Staff were friendly and very helpful.Breakfast was normal continental things including hot boiled eggs, enough to get you through til lunch.Nice place for lunch is a cafe called Oude Wester, on corner very close to Anne Franks house. Very pretty female waitress, Australian, well worth a visit.Would stay again.

The room was comfortable and clean, the staff very curteous and helpful. The breakfast was very good - cold meats, cereal, boiled eggs etc and very good coffee. The hotel was very central, about 10 mins walk from central station, and one street away from some good restaurants.

<Content>Great place. Will return to this hotel. I recently stayed 2 nights at the Singel. I have never experienced nicer hotel staff. The hotel is an old canal house so the rooms are small but more than adequate. The beds were soft and the down blankets were a luxury. Our room was very quiet because the Singel Hotel is located on a quiet canal just a few blocks from the heart of Amsterdam. It is also a couple of minutes walk from the train station so I had no problems walking from the train. Anne Frank House is close by as is Dam Square. I will return to Amsterdam and stay at the Singel again.

<Content>Great hotel, amazing staff Our stay at Singel Hotel was great. The room was very nice and clean. The furniture was modern and bed comfortable. The staff at the hotel was simply amazing. They were extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast, which was included in the price of the hotel, was plentiful (toast, eggs, etc)--we felt no need to have breakfast anywhere else. The location was really great. It's a 5 minute walk to central station, where every tram and bus in the city stops. Dam Square and Anne Frank's house are also a short walking distance away. The hotel is located on a quiet canal, away from the frenzy of the Red Light District and some of the other areas.

<Content>Great little hotel This is a really nice friendly hotel. Our room was small but clean and perfectly adequate for a city break. The location is great, easy walking distance from the station and also to the central shopping streets and Dam Square. The area is surprisingly quiet considering how central the hotel is. All the staff at the hotel spoke good English and were knowledgable and helpful.Definitely a place that I would recommend. The only proviso would be the rooms not overlooking the canal may not be quite so pleasant but ours did and it was fine.

<Content>A hidden gem We arrived mid morning, check in was quick, and we were pleased to find the hotel had a lift (unusual in Amsterdam canal side hotels) as our room was on the third floor. The room itself was comfortable, and although not spacious, there was enough room for the 3 of us to move around without bumping into things (or each other!); we had a nice view over the canal 鈥?rooms on the other side would be looking out into the back of the buildings on Stromarkt I would guess. Breakfast was the usual Dutch affair of cheeses, cold meats, cereal, bread, preserves  tea/coffee; the breakfast room doubled as the lounge, where you could get tea/coffee or a beer anytime you wanted. The hotel also offered a safety deposit box for 鈧? for the length of your stay.

<Content>best value in Amsterdam second time was here 7 years ago and the whole package was the same high standard, alright the rooms are on the small size but they are very clean and the bed is comfortable with the best pillows i have ever experienced., and who spends time other than to sleep in. The staff are the best , the breakfast good and hearty and the coffee is to die for. Situation good not be much better and to have a lift in a canal house is very welcome. You will find it hard to find a better place to stay for the price

<Content>Fantastic This was my 3rd trip to amsterdam and my 2nd stay in the Singel Hotel. I was travelling with a friend and we were there for 4 nights. The room we stayed in was large and very clean and looked like it had just been refurbished. Clean towels were put in the room every day! The television has a lot of channels and you can get BB1 and BB2 with MTV thrown in. I think there were a couple of american channels as well.Breakfast was from 7 till 10 and consisted of cheese's, breads and jams. Try the fruit loaf toasted with jam and cheese on it!! Yummy!The reception has someone available 24 hours and all the staff are really frondly. If you need anything just let them know and they'll do their best for you. My friend had taken her own towel and it had got mixed up in the hotels ones. We mentioned it to the receptionist and i've just had an e-mail letting me know they'll send it back to the UK for her! Very helpful!Planning the next trip now and the Singel is at the top of our list!!Well recommended.

<Content>Small but perfectly formed. Stayed in the Singel hotel over new year for 3 nights and it was a great little hotel. Ok the rooms are small but very clean and the bed really comfy.The staff are so friendly and helpful, we had breakfast in our room every morning and tipped the staff for bringing it up but they are so nice and honest that they didn't keep it but took it off our bill instead!!! The breakfast is totally adequate and the coffee is good.We had a canal view so that was pretty good, it snowed the night before New years eve and it looked beautiful.I would definitely recommend this hotel and it's only round the corner from central station. This was my fifth time in Amsterdam and the hotels are getting better!

<Content>Good hotel in central position. Stayed there for a couple of nights with daughter and friend in triple room, bathroom a little on the small side, but very clean, as was the bedroom. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel well situated and central to most tourist attractions and train station. Deffinately recommended.

<Content>Singel fits the bill The Singel Hotel offers all that a traveler needs for a modest visit to Amsterdam. The rooms are well-maintained and clean, the staff is helpful and friendly, and the included breakfast is more than satisfactory. It's hard to beat the location - right near the station and city center but on a quiet canal. Front desk staff can help you book canal and countryside tours. Overall, the Singel is a perfectly good place to stay, especially for the money.

<Content>Great location but cramped Booked a room for three nights for our wedding anniversary. We knew roughly what to expect from the reviews herein and would agree that the room was very small and that the bathroom had some shortcomings. There was no storage space for clothes apart from limited hanging space (no drawers for underwear, T shirts etc, had to leave them in suitcase), but who cares?Beds were very comfortable and room very warm and clean.Breakfast was good:- cereals, juice, bread (lovely fruit bread!) boiled eggs,ham,cheese,jams, pots of coffee/tea (lovely waitress - cor blimey!!!)Location was first class. Walked from Central station in 5 minutes. Tram stop 1-2 minutes walk away. Restaurants (try Gauchos for excellent steaks), bars, pavement cafes/bars/shops within 1-2 minutes walk. Singel canal area is beautiful and lined with old canal houses and lovely trees (oh yeah - and the odd discreet red light!). Walked from here to most places although a three day travel card was about 12 Euros and you can jump on any tram or bus if you're feeling knackered or want to save time as we did - eg Ann Franks house and Van Gogh museum only five minutes on tram (if that). Dam square a few minutes walk away.Usual test for hotels - would you stay here again? - definately - the location (and waitress!) make up for the hotels minor shortcomings. Cleanliness, location and a comfortable bed are top of the list when we look for a hotel as we don't intend to spend much time in the room and this hotel amply satisfies these criteria.If you want a clean, reasonably priced hotel with a good breakfast in what I would say was the best location in Amsterdam then I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>A Wonderful find in the heart of Amsterdam I would recommend the Singel Hotel as it was excellently run and spotlessly clean despite being full to the rafters with guests when we stayed. The staff were consistent in their friendly and chilled approach. Also nothing seemed a bother to the reception staff and they genuinely went out of their way to try and provide local info etc. It proved good value for money. The best thing though about it though was its easy to find location especially for two rather inebriated Scots with no sense of direction.

<Content>Quiet hotel in a fantastic location I stayed at the Singel for one night while on a business trip and the location is fantastic -- a minute's walk from the train station and just one street away from the infamous red light district with all its bars and clubs. But the hotel itself is on a quiet, safe street and if you head in the opposite direction to the red light district there are some tourist-free bars and restaurants -- the owner is really helpful and will give you directions for some friendly places. The room was small but very comfortable although the bathroom could have done with some updating, and despite the freezing wind blowing outside, the heating kept the room toasty warm. Breakfast was the usual Dutch affair of bread, ham and cheese -- and, as always in Holland, amazing coffee. I didn't see a bar/restaurant in the hotel so I'm confused about the rating some tripadvisor visitors have given for that, but perhaps I didn't look around enough as I was only there for a night. I'd stay again.

<Content>Great hotel Very pleased with this hotel. Booked it on AmsterdamBy for 108 euro/night. Small room and tiny bathroom, but the water was blessedly hot. Requested a canal view and we got one. Beds and pillows were super comfortable. Breakfast was very good although there wasn't a lot of it. Coffee pot on the table. Very convenient location. On the edge of the Red Light District, but street was quiet and safe. Staff was attentive and very courteous.

<Content>Singel Hotel - Not a disappointment We recently stayed at the Singel Hotel and would like to reassure anybody who has visited this site and seen mixed reviews, we were not disappointed. Before going I had read other people's comments and was apprehensive however after an enjoyable stay at this hotel we would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a clean and friendly hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location and we stayed in room 24 which was overlooking the Singel Canal. The bed linen was very clean and each day we had clean towels, the staff were very friendly and helpfull. Our room was very well heated and yes although the bathroom is small, on the whole this hotel is well recommended.

After reading previous reviews i can only imagine the Singel has undergone refurbishment as I found our room although quite basic clean with modern decor and fittings.

<Content>SIngel Slack What a disappointment - such a difference from the description to the reality. Our room had a toilet without ventilation on a room without ventilation or heating. There was a hole in the floor. I am sure there are nice rooms in this place but how can you be sure what you end up in?

<Content>Not bad Singel Hotel was, in a word, fine. The location is great, no question, probably its best quality. But our room was rather cold, the double bed consisted of two twin beds pushed together, and since we were given a room on the first floor, it was rather loud and not at all private (we could hear the people talking and opening doors in the reception all the time). We asked for another room but were told that there were none left - however, someone checked out while we were standing there, yet for some reason they wouldn't let us have their room. Reception was very friendly but not terribly helpful. Rooms were rather sparse (don't expect any amenities in the bathroom), but breakfast was tasty. All in all, though, I can't complain. The hotel was reasonably priced for Amsterdam, but I wouldn't pay that much for a hotel of this quality in any other city. For a one-night stay, it was perfectly adequate. I would probably look elsewhere for my next trip to Amsterdam, but wouldn't mind staying here again if I couldn't find anything else.

<Content>Good No-frills Hotel Stayed at the Singel in November '05 and overall it was a pleasant stay. The location can't be faulted - It was a 15 minute train ride from the airport and a 5 minute walk to the hotel from Central Station. All the city has to offer is within easy walking distance or a quick tram ride.The rooms are clean but small and basic with a good shower. They sorely lacked tea/ coffee making facilities though. The very friendly and helpful staff are always smiling. Overall, if you are wanting and pleasant budget hotel in a great location you could do a lot worse than the Singel.

<Content>Very Enjoyable Stay I stayed at the Singel Hotel for 7 nights beginning November 2 and found it to be a perfect location, near the tourist center but on a far quieter street on the edge of a vibrant residential area with plenty of restaurants and shopping (the Joordan). The hotel staff was quite friendly, which is not always the case in small European hotels, and I enjoyed several conversations with Christian, one of the owners. The hotel is exceoptionally clean. In order to have a canal view, I agreed to stay in a smoking room, which had virtually no detectable smoke smell, a pleasant surprise, as well as a beautiful canal view. As noted in several other reviews, the beds are excellent - better in fact than in more deluxe accomodations. Yes, as in most European boutique hotels, the rooms are small and you may hear some noise from other guests' comings and goings, but this is minor. A very nice breakfast spread (try the raisin bread) that Christian indicated he intended to improve even further. As for the pay in advance policy, the owner indicated that they had had a few non-paying guest problems, so it is understandable. Definitely a winner overall.

<Content>Great location, but very small  We were given Rm 7, which we found very, very small and difficult to move around. The bathroom, although kept well, was very small as well. The double bed however, was wonderful and so very comfortable - top points for that! As a young couple staying the weekend though, we were woken up each morning by (1) the people coming  going in the lift next door to us; (2) the hotel residents having breakfast  the kitchen cleaning up afterwards, as it's all on the same floor, and (3) the children running and shouting in the foyer, as it's also on the same floor as Rm 7. If you're a young couple staying there, who enjoy a sleep-in the morning after going out the previous night, ask for another room! On a very good note however, the hotel was ideally place - so close to the station, shopping streets, coffee shops, dam square, cafe's and of course, about 10 minutes' walk from the red light district! The staff at the hotel were also really kind and accommodating. If you can get over the noise and the tiny room, then it's the place for you!Ali McClure  Gareth Lotter

<Content>Some tulip! We were asked to pay in advance (for 3 days) which we were told was normal for Amsterdam (not so). We asked to see the room which had a solid brick wall 300 mm. outside the back window (full height) which we refused. As they wre unable to offer another room we had to find another hotel elsewhere. We had requested a room with a canal view.Left a very bad taste on our first trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Delightful Anniversary My wife and I spent our 1st wedding anniversary (aah) at the Singel, on the weekend just gone (21st - 23rd). The hotel is very well located (5 minutes walk from the train station, absolutely NO potential of danger at 21.30 on a Friday evening). The hotel itself is welcoming, clean, and met our requirements perfectly. Spending a weekend in Amsterdam is an absolute must, and we'll have no hesitation in booking at the Singel on our next visit.

<Content>Clean  We have just arrived back from a busy sight-seeing adventure in Amsterdam. The apartment (Singel 344) is centrally located, but just far enough from 'The Dam' (Main area) to give you that much loved peace, especailly after are an action packed day on the canal, bike, museums or whatever you choose to do.The apartment was exceptionally clean with good facilities that would be expected in an everyday apartment. Some tea  coffee refreshments were provided which saved us from trekking off to the local supermarket, (only five minutes walk, go right out the door).A thoroughly enjoyable time and we are definately looking at heading back there in the near future.

<Content>Singel was a good choice! Chose Singel Hotel after long and hard studying of different Amsterdam hotels and was happy with my decision! Was looking for an economical, clean, comfortable 3 star-hotel in a good location. This one is all that! Stayed 8 nights in July in a double room facing the canal. Was so happy with the location; right in a center, yet away from noisy traffic and all night partiers! Got good nights sleep in really comfortable, soft bed. In the room everything was working fine, housekeeping was efficient yet discreet; most days my room was cleaned while I had breakfast, and not ONCE was I woken up to knock on the door by housekeeping!! Not even when I slept til 11.30! It was easy to walk everywhere, plus all services - bars, caf茅s, restaurants, coffee shops, minimarkets - are right around the corner! Athmosphere is relaxed, staff friendly but not in a annoying, forcing-a-conversation-kinda way! Breakfast was good; 3-4 different kinds of breads, yogurts, juices, meats and cheeses, jams. I didn't have any complaints the whole time and can recommend this hotel to anyone with similar criterias to ones I had. Will certainly stay here again!

<Content>Excellent location, bit tired. The Singel Hotel is very well located, close to Central Station, plenty of restaurants nearby, walking distance to several of the attractions. (Note to families - there are a couple of 'lady windows' in this street, however these can be hard to avoid in Amsterdam!)It is their policy to pay upfront. We asked to see the room first, and this was OK. They also like you to leave the key, but this system seemed to work OK.Our room was on the top floor, and was a typical loft/attic type room. The room was non-smoking (sign on the door) as requested, however there was a smell of stale smoke. Either the room has previously been smoking, or people have ignored this.It is important to make a distinction between 'dirty' and 'tired' - our room was very clean, and was well serviced each day. However, certain parts of the room were a bit tired - the bathroom sink was quite worn. The bathroom was a 'wet-room' design, so there was no shower divider or curtain, so things could get a bit wet! There was no bathroom fan, which was a major disadvantage.The TV was small, but we were not in Amserdam to watch TV, so this didn't bother us. The Continental breakfast was very good, and included cereals and hard-boiled eggs, which were a nice touch.Our room was not the kind of hotel room you sit and relax in, however the location made it perfect for our first visit to Amsterdam. Would we stay here again? - we would probably look around for what else is available, and might consider something further out now we know our way around a bit, however this would remain our comparison base at the internet rate we paid.

<Content>Great hotel for sightseeing Having read the negative reviews we were rather apprehensive but our fears were misplaced. OK ..the rooms are small.. but well equipped and spotlessly clean. We had a side view of the canal and the hotel was very quiet at night. Security was strict but that was to our benefit. Staff very friendly. good breakfast, very good position for seeing all the sights. We walked everywhere from the hotel and there were lots of reasonably priced restaurants nearby. Would go there again.

<Content>Best Pillows and Comfiest Sleep Ever! This was one of the most comfortable hotel beds We've ever slept on!The hotel was very clean, the staff was nice, honest and accomodating. the morning breakfast included in the room rate was typical Euro buffet style, but better cheese and meat than some free Euro buffets I've had before.We asked for a canal view room and had a huge room! Twice bigger than we anticipated it to be. Hotel is in walking distance to the main rail station, dam square and easy access to transitWe will definitely stay here again on a return trip

<Content>Good, honest hotel Just returned from long weekend in Amsterdam staying at the Singel. First time we had ever just booked a flight and room over the net and used your site to judge the best place to stay. And we got it right! We were on a budget but wanted the best we could afford and this hotel really met the remit. The room was clean, tidy, warm and non smoking (as requested) it was quite in the evening (as requested) but you could hear other guests moving about, but it IS a hotel afterall!!!The view was hillarious! A wall approx 1 and half metres away! But we didnt want to buy the room, only rent it! And all houses in the City are constructed this way, hay live and let live!!!Easy to reach from Centraal Station and in walking distance even with cases!Only snag was no coffee/Tea making facilities in the room but 24 service was available. (My coffee addicted husband's moan!) The food was good and honest continental style, as much as you wanted and a good choice. The staff were friendly and accommodating. You could hire a lock up for 5 euros for the whole stay. The location was central and ideal...I would completely recommend this hotel and the City!Also, (and not related to the hotel, but essential to the 'holiday' experience!) try the Bagal Village at the bottom of the street! The warm Cinnomonand sultana sweet bagel with home made cream cheese and fig jam was to die for!!!

<Content>Decent Economical Hotel This is decent and economical hotel with basic facilities , very close to the Centraal Station and within walking distance of several restaurants and the Damrak. However there are some of the famous redlighted windows right next to the hotel.The room was small but decent . It was clean and had basic facilities. Takes some time to get used to some quirks. e.g to switch on the light in the bathroom you have to pull a rope. They provided a very cosy comforter. Room was clean and well kept.They have a basic breakfast included which will get you going in the morning.

<Content>Hard to beat the price and the location I think I must have had the same room as the Detroit reviewer...it seems to be their only nonsmoking single! It was truly tiny, but quite adequate to my needs, and very clean. The location is convenient to Centraal Station (a major point in my booking here), there are a number of restaurants in easy walking distance, and the staff was all friendly and helpful. Yes, you do pay when you check in, but I really didn't find that a problem (and in a city with so many younger tourists, the hotel has probably found that to be safest for them!). The neighborhood is fairly quiet, and picturesque. I'd stay here again with no qualms.

<Content>Pros and cons This hotel has pros and cons.Good points: - excellent location, on a very beautiful canal, close to Damrak and the Central Station; - very good breakfast; - helpful and nice staff that gave me valuable tips about restaurants; - clean and comfortable room.Bad points: - I asked a room with view of the canal two months before staying there, but they gave me a backroom with a view of a big wall about 3 metres from my window; - I had to pay for my entire stay when I arrived, before going to my room (very unusual); - some guests were noisy and disturbed my sleep.

<Content>I Had a Great Experience! I was a little worried when I read some recent reviews of this hotel. I'm glad I chose to stay at the Singel! The desk clerk joked that I had the smallest room in all of Amsterdam and he was probably right but it suited my needs perfectly: a very clean, quiet room with all the amenities (shower, TV w/cable). I requested a non-smoking room and the room was bright, modern, airy and smoke-free! The location is fabulous - near Centraal Station but on a quiet canal virtually in the city center but close to the western side of town with great shops and restaurants. Breakfast at Singel included an array of meats, cheeses, fruit, toasts, yogurt, granola, juice. Each table gets a carafe of coffee/tea. Friendly service - yes you leave your room key but this is common in Europe! Would I stay here again? Yes!!
