<Content>impeccable service I wasn't sure what to think when we bid on priceline a name your own price for downtown/convention center for a 4 star hotel. Most of the reviews seemed good but reading some posts on the forum recommended other hotels when Riverfront Wyndham was brought up but we got an amazing rate. We hoped for the best and the best is what we got. I was the first to arrive in New Orleans and was at the hotel by 10:30 am.I was immediately greeted by friendly attendant who helped with my luggage. I was prepared to drop off my bags and check in later but they were happy to let me check in early and they made sure had everything I needed. Some people have complained when they've booked with Priceline that they get the worst room in the hotel but that was not the case. The room was immaculate, spacious and the bed extremely comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small but fine. That evening, we had appetizers at 7 on Fulton the restaurant within the hotel and once again the staff gave superb service. I eat seafood but not meat and they offered to prepare a dish specially for me and it was wonderful. I have to be honest another concern was location. I typically like to stay in the quarter right in the middle of everything but better deals were available in the downtown/convention center area so we decided to try it. The location was fine. While not right in the middle of everything it was close to attractions such as the aquarium, riverwalk mall, restaurants such as Mother's and Mulates and more. It was only a 10 minute walk into the quarter and right by Harrahs. During the day we'd typically walk to the quarter and in the evenings after going out we'd take a Taxi back. Everytime we walked through the front lobby we were greeted and the staff cheerfully answered any questions and helped whenever needed. Although I think I still prefer staying in the middle of the quarter I would not hestitate to stay here again or to recommend this hotel because the service was some of the best I've received from a hotel in New Orleans and because of the comfort of the room.

<Content>Superb Wyndham Quite frankly this was the quietest hotel I've ever stayed in. The rooms were good sized and spotless. The staff went out of their way to open doors and offer help each and every time we passed through the lobby. The beds, bathrooms, showers, etc. were all top notch. The location is very close to Harrah's and the Riverwalk. I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.

<Content>Great Room! The best thing about the hotel was the people - they were friendly and helpful. The room was very spacious, and was quiet. We could walk to the french quarter, and other attractions.Even when there was a slight issue with the room, the staff took care of us easily, and were very responsive, evening going out of their way to help us out. I would definately return!

<Content>Our Hotel I loved this hotel! The staff was wonderful, the room was spacious and comfortable, and the location was perfect. I read a few of the reviews prior to staying at the hotel, and some state that the location wasn鈥檛 ideal or close to anything. Well, if you enjoy walking, and exploring what this area has to offer this is perfect! That is exactly what we did. The short walks to the major happenings was what really made this trip enjoyable. When we were done sightseeing, or just enjoying the festive atmosphere, we walked back to our quiet hotel and got the rest we needed for the next day of exploring. The staff was great, one of the desk agents even helped us find a great place to eat鈥? We will definitely be staying here again鈥?

<Content>Not really on the riverfront, but very nice nonetheless A nice surprise. Once you get over the name not being accurate (the Riverfront is quite a walk away--and the hotel is not a highrise, so no views of the water), this proves to be a lovely boutique hotel. Despite not much of a lobby, the room was gorgeous, and clearly just renovated--everything was immaculate. This room was in the old section, and managed to be both historic and sleek. Huge too, could have bowled in there. Beds are great, particularly the duvets, and bathrooms are quite functional and bright. One wall of the room had exposed brick and plantation shutters.Fitness center is limited but free.Location wasn't bad--a few blocks in back of Harrah's casino, and a block from the kind of depressing Riverwalk mall as well as the convention center--but the heart of the French Quarter was about 30 minutes' walk.No pool--a drawback in often-hot and sticky New Orleans.Staff was quite friendly and helpful--kudos on that score.Priceline gave this a 4 star rating--probably a bit overstated--but at $61 a night, what a value!If this is what Wyndham has become, good deal--this hotel is a credit to their brand.

<Content>One of the best stays What makes this hotel so great are the people. From the bellhop to the desk clerks. Everyone could not have been nicer or more helpful. It is within walking distance of almost everything. The rooms are big (except the bathrooms). The beds are VERY comfortable and the hotel is quiet. We had breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. We stayed 6 nights and would go back if we visit New Orleans again. We stay in many hotels during the year for leisure travel. I don't usually write a review but this hotel certainly deserves credit for their outstanding service.

<Content>Huge room Booked because close to convention center. Unfortunately the convention center is like a mile long so it is a little hike if your seminars are in the far end. Hotel staff was good and efficient. Our corner king room was huge! Great bed. Average bathroom. The room was a bit loud to outside traffic since on 2nd floor. Clean and within walking distance of restaurants in warehouse district.

<Content>Excellent Hotel!! Myself and 3 other friends came to New Orleans for the Essence Festival July 4-7, 2008. We couldn't have picked a better hotel to stay at! We had day activities to attend inside the Convention Center which is right across the street from the hotel. Also across the street is the nice Riverwalk Mall. The beds were so comfortable. My friends and I melted in them every night and we slept like babies! I really enjoyed my stay here! If you are coming to New Orleans and you will be at the Convention Center, this is the best hotel to stay at. It was 4 of us in one room and we were very comfortable. The standard room is a very nice size. Great job to all the hotel personel. You were wonderful and made our stay very comfortable. I would definetly stay at Wyndham again!

<Content>Nice hotel This is a beautiful, classy hotel with polite staff and clean, upscale rooms. It is very convenient to Harrah's and the Convention Center, but it is a little walk to the French Quarter. If you don't like to walk, take a cab to the Quarter. Despite its name, it does not have a great view of the river, and not much is happening at the Riverwalk mall anyway since Katrina. I was a little concerned about the safety of walking from the Quarter to the hotel at night (I'm a former N.O. resident and am very familiar with downtown) but it was fine. Just walk from the Quarter to Harrah's, then to the Harrah's parking lot, then to the hotel in the next block. Hotel parking was $32 a night, so we played for 30 minutes at Harrah's and got 24 hours of parking for free.

<Content>Conference/Vacation stay We were in New Orleans for a conference and some vacation time. We stayed at the Wyndham for 7 nights. There were 3 of us and each one had a different type of room. It was a wonderful stay. I had a historical king. Great room-large enough but very cozy. The bed was prefect and the towels were big and fluffy. The room furniture was in good shape-well appointed. My request for a refrig was granted due to medical needs-no charge (would have cost $15.00 a day if not for medical). The air system worked great-it was in the upper 90's some days. One of the other guests had a corner king (huge room) and the other had a double queen, also a huge room. The staff was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I can't say enough about the housekeeping gal-she was great-all requests were met. After a couple of days it really felt like home. The desk staff and the bell staff were great also. I would not think twice about staying there again!The hotel is 1 block from the convention center, 2 blocks from Harahs, 1 block to the trolley stop at Riverwalk, and only a short walk into the French Quarter. It felt safe most of the time but there are still a lot of buildings that are not open when you walk away from the major areas.

<Content>Great stay We stayed at the Wyndham Riverfront for 6 nights in March 2008. It was convenient to the convention centre where I attended a conference. After 36 hours of travelling from Australia, check in was quick and easy! Our room was spacious and the bed large and comfortable. The bathroom was small but fully stocked of towels and toiletries.The Wyndham is about 15 min walk to the French Quarter but there are well lit streets to walk along or there is a tram stop near the casino. It would have been convenient to have a bar fridge in the room however there are ice machines on every floor. All the staff we had dealings with were all polite and helpful.

<Content>Good stay in April We stayed at the Wyndham Riverfront for the Saturday night of French Quarter Fest. The hotel and our room were clean and very comfortable. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. It was altogether a good experience and I would certainly stay there again. The only things keeping me from giving this hotel a 5-star rating were: Rough and thin towels; a charge for local calls; charge for internet access; and limited television stations. We typically stay in mid-range hotels that almost always provide better towels, free local calls and internet, and better TV coverage.

<Content>Nice hotel a bit far from main tourist attaractions Just spend four nights at this property. This is my fourth time in New Orleans and first time post-Katrina and with family. We booked by calling the property directly as we needed two rooms and they were running a second room 1/2 off special. The rooms were nicely decorated. The beds had nice and confomfortable linens. The bathrooms are small at this property. The concierge was very nice and friendly. The only thing I think may need improvement is to have the water and coffee supplies replenished each night by housekeeping. However, be aware that parking is 28 per day, plus tax. We spent most of our time walking to the French Quarter for meals, sightseeing, and shopping. However, there is a nice Cajun restaurant and brewery in walking distance. Overall, very nice property. However, I would not stay here again with children. The crime rate in New Orleans is high and I would eliminate walking long distances after dark with shopping bags and kids (obvious tourists)! I do think that common sense prevails, stay in well lit areas and never talk to strangers. I did see the scam ltaking place around the Natchez that is listed in posts here regarding, Where are you shoes? The scam artists actually said they were part of the Natches (riverboat) crew but they obviously were not. Be careful of stuff like that and you will be fine.

<Content>Somewhat Deceiving On our way back to Texas after traveling to Biloxi Ms to see our son in the Air Force, we decided we would give New Orleans a try after having not been there in about 15 years. I studied all of the reviews in Trip Advisor and chose the Wyndham somewhat due to having Riverfront in the name. I visualized relaxing in my room while watching activities on the river. When I booked the room, I even told them I wanted a room with a river view. The young lady told me they were completely booked but could give me a Superior King Corner for just a little more and I booked it. When we got to the hotel at around noon and were told that the check in time was not until 3:00, which was ok with us since we were going to go walk in the French Quarter anyway. They asked for my cell number so they could call me when the room was ready. I never got a call and we went back to the hotel assuming they just forgot and found out all of the Superior King Corners were still not ready and they suggested one of our normal rooms on the sixth floor with a great big window and the best view of the River. We were tired and accepted. We got to the room and looked out the window and discovered that we looked out over a parking lot (about a 400 car lot) and on the other side of that was the railroad tracks and then the River Front Mall. The only view of the river was a very small peek through a breezeway of the mall. The hotel is only 6 stories tall and so is the mall. In short, if you are wanting a view of the river....it does not happen at the Wyndham Riverfront. Oh and by the way, when I got my bill it was for the Superior King Corner. If you are not looking for a view, it is actually a nice hotel with very comfortable beds and is very clean.

<Content>Fantastic Stay My wife and I just recently stayed at the Wyndham Riverfront in New Orleans and had a great experience. Overall, this is based on our experience with ALL the staff at the Hotel. They provided some of the best, personalized service and attention that we have received. From the doormen, front desk, reception, room service, etc, everyone was friendly and very attentive.When we asked for a room change after arriving, we were upgraded and received a suite (we are Wyndham by Request members).We ordered in breakfast on several occasions and the food and the service was very good.I would recommend the hotel for its location as well. It is near the river in a very clean area close to shopping, the French Quarter, and the casino. We had originally thought we would stay in the French Quarter, but after having gone there, we felt we had made an excellent choice. You're close enough to walk but you are able to get away to a quieter area of New Orleans.By the way, take some of the tours while you are there -- we can recommend the plantation and city tours of the Garden District, French Quarter, and Katrina areas. They truly give you a feel of this area and the information provided (especially about the Katrina impacted areas) is truly impactful.

<Content>Nice stay at Wyndham Stayed here for one night. Arrived early, but they let us check in to our room, which was great. Room was nice, spacious enough, complimentary water bottles and Wolfgang Puck coffee. Bath was fine, nice toiletries. Location right across the street from Riverfront shopping, which we didn't even get to. Short walk from French Quarter attractions. Booked through harrahs.com and it's a block and a half from Harrah's. Close to CBD restaurants, etc. also. Would recommend this hotel and stay here again. Very good bed with comfy mattress and linens.

<Content>Nice Hotel and great convention center location! I was in NO for a 5Linx national convention from KC, MO. Had a great time the hotel was beautiful! One key point: ask to be close to the elevator for your room type. The building hallways wind and I was in room 620 and there is one way to the room and one way back to the elevator...long windy hallway that takes you in a circle! Plush beds, clean bathrooms and iron in room! Some of my team stayed in the Embassy around the corner....Wyndahm had better bathrooms and beds than the Embassy-I saw first hand! (And was $50 cheaper!/night!)The front desk staff was nice folks and the bell man was very sweet. They let me leave my bags in the bag storage area ALL day (post check out) to go see the city and tour. Came back to get my bags at 9pm!In house restaurant kinda pricey so did not eat there. Riverwalk is across the street: eateries and shopping! Yeah!Nice location two blocks north of convention center which was where I needed to be all weekend!Highly recommend!

<Content>Classy Hotel Got a good deal on a very nice hotel for an over night stay between back to back cruises. It's at least a 10 to15 minute walk to the French Quarter but we liked everything about the hotel. About 2 or 3 blocks down the street from the hotel we found a good covered parking lot to leave our car for 13 days for $120 total. The lots name is Ampco System Parking and they shuttled us to and from the cruise port for free and the best part was they were wating for us after both cruises just outside where we cleared coustoms.

<Content>Great location Checked in on 12/31/07 and out on 1/2/08. We were in town for the Sugar Bowl and decided to stay outside of the French Quarter to avoid some of the craziness of New Year's Eve. Check in was quick and easy. Help with luggage was great and efficient. The hotel is only 6 stories but has a lot of rooms on long corridors. If you don't want to walk a long way, ask for a room close to the elevators. But ice and vending are at the end of the long winding corridor.Beds were very comfortable and the room was clean with nice amenities including coffee and coffee maker. The do not disturb signs are flimsey and tend to fall off of the door handle. Ours disappeared and the maid was knocking on our door too early in the morning on January 1. She graciously left when asked. The housekeeping staff was very pleasant and did a wonderful job.The walls between rooms seem to be a little thin. From 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. we had a crying baby next door. We didn't use room service and didn't have a chance to eat at the restaurant. On New Year's Eve it was closed for a private party.The hotel is very close to the Convention Center and the River Walk. Also close to Harrah's Casino if you're up for a little gambling. It is a hike to the French Quarter but you can walk it or easily get a taxi or take very inexpensive public transportation. Felt safe in this area.Close to the Bon Ton Cafe and Mother's restaurants. Both are excellent! Be prepared to wait in a line outside to eat at Mother's -they don't take reservations. Overall I would recommend the hotel. We used Orbitz to book and therefore didn't get our Wyndham by Request amenities. Learned we need to book directly with Wyndham.

<Content>Great Choice Great location! First let me say everyone told me to make sure I stayed in the french quarters, how wrong they were.The quarters is filled with people and hotel on top of hotel its a great place to visit,shop and eat but when it came time to rest it did not get any better than the Wyndham Riverfront. It sits across the street from the riverfront and streetcars that that takes you everywhere for $1.25 and .40 cents for seniors. The hotel is only six stories high it sits in warehouse district up and trendy where you find galleries and great local places to eat and listen to some great New Orleans music. When I searched the websites looking at hotels I found lots with that old New Orleans feel but that wasnt what we wanted. We wnted something contemporary and new with clean lines. When I saw the picture of white down comforters I knew I had found it and I was right. The hotel was modern clean and very comfortable.The staff was wonderful from doormen,room service, dry cleaning ,maid service and setting up our return flight. I found out while there they had two story rooms that that are very ice and very reasonable priced. My hat off to most of the staff especially Danny Noel who manages the restaurant 7 located in the hotel .I give the place 5+

<Content>AAO meeting across the street If you have business at the New Orleans Convention Center, this is the place to stay. A short two minute walk will get you there and it's only about 10 minutes to the French Quarter.New Orleans is trying very hard to present its best face to visitors and it's working. The area around the Convention Center is spotless. I couldn't find a piece of trash on any street. The trees were freshly planted and everything looked fresh. I heard all the homeless now live in Houston and would have to believe that. The streets were filled with only tourists or business people. The hotel informed me they were over-booked when I checked in about 6 p.m. and they would therefore give me only smoking rooms. Since the town was full for the convention, I had no other choice. Try as best I could, the room never lost that stench from smoking and my clothes still reek of it as they hang in my closet at home. Oh well.Otherwise, the staff were very friendly and helpful. I ate several times at the downstairs restaurant and enjoyed quick service, good food and reasonable prices.My maid seemed to have a few problems though, as I often found a lack of hand towels, new shampoo or new soaps upon returning to the room. A call to the front desk fixed all this, but it was a bit of a pain. How much can a new shampoo cost them?The connecting door between my room and the next seemed quite thin. Unfortunately, my neighbor liked to leave his TV on all night to help him ?sleep? and I had to call the front desk one night, as the volume was loud enough to keep me awake. They promptly visited his room and all was quiet for the rest of the evening though. The central location made is easy to wander around downtown at night. The area seemed very safe and well-lit. I would not hesitate to bring my family back to this hotel for vacation. I only hope they can keep the area as nice as it currently is.

<Content>A Wonderful Hotel My husband and I went to New Orleans to celebrate our 1st Wedding Anniversary. I am a Wyndam by Request member; as a member I let them know we were celebrating our anniversary. We were scheduled to have a room with 2 queen beds. They upgraded us to a two-story suite (502). When we checked in there was a bottle of chilled champagne, a rose arrangement with a balloon attached, a cheese and cracker tray, bottled water etc. Arranged on our king size bed there were real roses spread over the bed in a shape of a heart. On the wall upstairs we watched TV on a 42 screen. We will never forget this anniversary celebration. The staff was acommodating and friendly. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Loved the Wyndham!! First of all, I got a great deal (with parking and breakfast) on the hotel's website. Then, I was upgraded to a loft room because I belong to the Wyndham hotel club. Gorgeous hotel!!!The staff was wonderful and accomodating. I will certainly stay there again when I'm back in New Orleans!!

<Content>Great Rooms, but no 'free' parking This hotel is a old building but has been restored to a beautiful hotel. Our room was great, clean and cool in the New orleans heat. The staff was very nice and helpful. The only thing I was upset about, was when I booked the room I was told about the valet parking (this is the only parking for the hotel, you can,t park yourself) but was not told until we got out of our car about the $28.00 per night fee for valet parking. Needless to say I left my bags in the lobby and went to park my car in the Casino,s parking lot next door for free.

<Content>Couldn't Be Better!! This hotel has been simply perfect! Everyone from the valet parking guy, to he front desk, to the employees in the restaurant were very friendly. Housekeeping did an amazing job everytime they came in. The room itself was to die for! Upon checking in, I was upgraded to a two story suite! I loved it. The breakfast was wonderful at 7 on Fulton (this was also included in my price). I paid 99.00 a night and got free valet parking and breakfast!! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Nothing to Rave about OK in my ESTIMATION. First I want to mention that I got a hotel room at this place free from Harrah's for 3 nites, so you can't beat that. We came in to NOLA on a Saturday and stayed at a different hotel on the edge of the Quarter, I absolutely loved (see other review). After brunch on Sunday we checked into the Riverfront. I just remember that our room was quite a walk from the elevator up some stairs and down some stairs, however the front desk warned us. There were 3 of us. Husband, myself and 12 year old daughter. The room held 2 double beds. Needless to say, double beds don't cut it for my husband and me, but hey it was free I can't complain. What I can complain about is maid service. One day they were so late, we just decided to forego the maid service and the other days they came to clean around 2:30 to 3:00 p.m. even though we were gone, out of the hotel every morning. No refrigerators in room either. The front desk was very nice and the hotel is in proximity to a lot of different places. But I'll think twice about staying here again.

<Content>Great hotel, location I had a great experience at this hotel. It's very close to the Morial Convention Center and Riverwalk, and also within easy walking distance to the French Quarter. Comfy beds, clean rooms and very courteous staff. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Close to everything I arrived in New Orleans for the Essence Music Festival expecting to see blighted buildings and rebuilding going on following the devastation from Katrina less than two years ago. What I found was a city thriving. I stayed at The Wyndham for three wonderful days and nights. The hotel borders the French Quarter, so it is quiet (unlike the Quarter at 4 a.m.) It never seems to stop.The staff really impressed me: friendly, and offering insight and assistance with great recommendations of what to see off the beaten path and the best way to get there.The hotel is right by the river and the only paddle wheeler still in use. Take the ride and eat on-board. The food was great (try the jambalaya.)The hotel longe and restaurant were above average, and the views from the hotel were better than the post cards.I will return, soon.

<Content>Loved everything about it. We stayed there for 1 night on May 5, 2007. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. Staff were all friendly, helpful, very accomodating. It was a nice little walk over to the Riverwalk area and French Quarter. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel!! Called the Riverfront Hotel, it is actually associated with Harrah's now! We just got back from Jazz Fest in New Orleans. My husband and I are usually always at the Marriott but our friends got us a great deal at the Riverfront. Since we booked through Harrah's, we thought we were at Harrahs. Don't make that mistake and get dropped off at Big Harrah's or you will be hiking over to the Riverfront with you bags, or following the bellman (who was so sweet to cart our crap)note: the new Harrah's hotel is BEAUTIFUL!The Riverfront is a smaller hotel down by the Riverwalk. So if you want to be in the Quarter or close to the Jazz Fest buses, this is a little farther of a walk. As I read in other reviews, complaints about the walk! yes, it's good for you, but after walking all day at Jazz Fest, the hotels on Canal and in the Quarter have one up on em!None the less, the rooms were very nice! Very clean, new comfy beds, with the thick nice comforters! beds are very important to us! The air conditioning wasn't blowing very hard in the room, so we called to see what they could do. Maintenance was there in no time! They even called with a follow up after he left.the staff was very nice and helpful.I would recommend this hotel!

<Content>They aim to please! This was my first trip to New Orleans since Katrina and I really didn't know what to expect. This hotel is adjacent to the convention center and is actually not a Wyndham property right now but I understand is going to be one again in the near future. The hotel is very well maintained and I have nothing but compliments for the staff in every area. Everyone from the front desk staff to housekeeping to the bellmen seemed genuinely glad we were there. Hats off to Demond (I think he is the bell captain) for recommending a great off-the-beaten-path restaurant and quickly arranging transportation He's a guy who truly seems to love his job!The room was very spacious and clean.

<Content>Another positive review OK, so I didn't pay a dime for my stay (Harrahs comped me for two nights); but while I thought about switching to the the Harrahs tower, I'm glad I didn't. The Riverfront Hotel is on Convention approx. two blocks from the casino (past Gordon Biersch and before Mulates). A compact hotel but the rooms are very nicely appointed; the staff was always friendly and helpful. There is always a doorman's greeting...and since you pass the counter on the way to the elevators, always a greeting from the staff. While the bathroom was a little more compact than average, it was above average in cleanliness. I was on the 2nd floor facing the front and didn't hear any car noise...that's the way to build a hotel! The room has touches of luxury (pillow top bed; extra pillows, flat screen TV with extra channels); also got a complimentary USA Today daily. Would definitely recommend.

<Content>Nice Room We came to visit a convention and the location was great. I booked the Harrah's Hot Deals Website and got a great rate. The staff was very friendly, parking was expensive, but that is par for the course in New Orleans.Hotel was very clean.Our biggest problem was because we were on a business trip we needed a receipt to turn into the company. Found out that we had to go to the Casino to get our receipt. We had to drive over, walk all the way across the casino to Conceirge. Of course nobody was there. Finally, got our receipt. I don't understand why it can not be printed at the hotel. Nobody could answer that question.

<Content>Very nice hotel This is a great hotel. I have never stayed in the Warehouse District before, but would not hesitate to do so in the future. The location was great, the staff were friendly and helpful. I asked for extra towels, and they were delivered within minutes! Large rooms, very comfortable beds, and very quiet. Overall a great experience.

<Content>Forget that fancy new Harrah's hotel! I just love this place, and I'm sorry as can be that I cheated on it with the new Harrah's hotel over on Canal. It's not as fancy or as close to the casino, but having stayed at the new place, I can say I vastly prefer this one.The Riverfront is quiet, clean and has all the basic amenities you'd expect from a CBD-area hotel. Best of all, the staff can't be beat for service and friendliness; they are willing to go out of their way to be helpful, and aren't as tied to Harrah's slick corporate ethos as their counterparts at the Canal Street hotel. I also like staying here because you can roll out of bed, down the elevator, across a parking lot and into the Riverwalk Mall (recovering slowly but steadily from its post-Katrina malaise) for a beignet and coffee at its Cafe du Monde outpost. Ladies, there's also a nice nail salon on the lower level at Riverwalk if you need a polish touchup. You can get your toes done and look out the window at the ships going by - lotsa fun!The in-hotel restaurant, 7 on Fulton, is actually quite good and is getting a lot of buzz locally for its fine cuisine. We've eaten there a few times and have never been disappointed. It's not the fanciest game in town, but it's really, really good. They also do room service - excellent gumbo and salads. Yum!Some folks complain about the extra two-block walk to the casino (or Quarter, or wherever), but it'll give you a chance to help walk off those beignets and gumbo. C'mon, it's good for you!

<Content>A jewel From the time we arrived at the front door till the time we left ,after a week's stay, we were amazed at the service, the cleanliness, and the more than helpfull staff. The only problem we encountered was the closest Harrahs garage was closed to the public, making parking very scarce unless you wanted to pay $28 a day for valet parking. We will definitely return to this property and will recommend it to anyone. Thanks for a nice week. Nov 12th thru 17th. The Scotts

<Content>Modern excellent hotel The Riverfront is run by Harrah's now. They said they had a need for 100+ more rooms than the new Harrah's hotel down the street. They're tied together. You can charge to your room at the Harrahs or Harrah's Hotel restaurants (they even looked up a Riverfront Hotel room charge when I asked at the front desk of the Harrah's Hotel).This hotel is very modern, with room size that seemed fine to me. A wall was angled with big windows (views are generally parking lots across the street). Modern bathroom with nice under-counter bins for towels and hair dryer. Nice shower head.The beds are great with nice comforter. Extra pillow in the closet.There's a work desk with wired Internet (or use the TV internet with wireless keyboard that's in the desk drawer). It costs $10 from noon till noon. But I got a strong wireless connection from an access point named CityOfNewOrleans. I had free Internet my entire stay.The desk chair was great! The Aereon-type chair was very comfortable.USA Today was delivered in the morning. More TV channels than most (40+ channels with CNBC, HBO, ESPN 1  2). They had a tray of apples in the lobby in the afternoon.There's one nice cloth-tablecloth restaurant in the lobby area (not very busy). And limited room service menu 24 hrs a day. That may be why they aren't listed as 4 stars.The front desk was very helpful on more than one occasion. They even had Internet behind the desk and looked up a local store for me using Mapquest.They can check your Harrah's play for possible comp of room charges before you check out. And if you're a Harrahs regular it's likely you'll get free room coupons in the mail. Or check rates after log-in at [----].The room had no refrigerator or mini-bar. That's the only thing I would have really liked. It's not common in the other area hotels I stayed at.Its a couple long blocks to Harrah's. A shuttle runs every 15 mins until 3am.The new Harrah's hotel is closer if you want to avoid walking. Save $20/day parking by parking at Harrah's garage and walking (and load up on the 65c can drinks in the machines in the garage).A car may not be needed here. Take the airport shuttle.Enjoy!

<Content>No longer Wyndham resort but we loved it! We stayed for 3 days last week. It was terrific! Staff always went out of their way to answer our questions. Coffee in room. The only thing lacking was tea. The rooms were clean . Short walk to Canal street,and one block from Mulates. Free shuttle available to Harrah's Casino. I would stay there again as everyone was eager to make our stay a pleasant one

<Content>Service Anyone? Nice Lobby, Nice Location, Nice room...but there were some problems that really annoyed me...We book smoking rooms...and often times have to call the lobby for ashtrays..it's not a big deal...you call the desk they bring one up. I've often had to call the front desk for pillows for the sofa bed minor details oversights that have always been rectified without much ado. Before Hurricane Katrina I stayed in this hotel..and had to call the lobby twice for an ashtray, I went to take a shower and noticed ...no towels. no glasses..after waiting for the ashtray I decided to go down to lobby and get towels rather than wait...I was advised that they would be brought right up...it was over an hour later and another call to the lobby...maybe they peg me as a chronic complainer which I'm not ...but when your waiting to take a shower and make an appointment..and your room has no towels..an hour doesn't cut it..I was even willing to go to whatever floor room service was on to get towels...There was no rudeness by the front desk personel but there also were no acknowledgement or offer to smooth over what obviously was crummy service..I hope things have imporved.

<Content>Wonderful experience My husband and I recently spent 2 nights at the RIVERFRONT and have nothing but positive things to say about it. There were absolutely NO problems and the shuttle service was frequent enough to be pleasant, people inside and outside the hotel were gracious and friendly, and our room was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely go there again.

<Content>Wonderful location for the price We stayed at The Riverfront Hotel in New Orleans on May 22, 2006. It has been totally renovated since the storm and we were very happy with our choice. The parking lot is right next door which was convenient for us as we drove. The staff were very cordial and eager to assist us. This hotel is only two blocks from Canal Street which connects with the French Quarter. We had a wonderful meal at Arnaud's on Boubon Street. Our room was somewhat smaller than average hotel rooms, but, this is the norm for New Orleans hotels. The room was clean and very comfortable with pillow top mattress. Airconditioning kept the room at the temperature we wanted. The amenities were nice. I would rec. this hotel to anyone wishing to experience a New Orlean's type atmosphere. It is my understanding this hotel is in an old rice mill. You can experience the very high ceilings, brick walls, and shuttered windows which gives it a tropical atmosphere. The price was very reasonable.

<Content>A true disaster This was my first trip to New Orleans and I stayed at Harrah's Riverfront hotel. My sheets were never changed in four days. I finally demaned (the evening of the 3rd day) to the manager that they be changed. I had already spoken to the night manager the evening before when I had him come to my room to bring me a coffee packet never replaced by housekeeping and to view the dirty cup and coffee pot left for me. I showed him the filty bathroom floor - never mopped, the carpet never vacuumed and the amenities never replaced. I had one bar of soap for 4 days and no bath mat. I showed him the alarm clock, which on the 2nd night went off at 2:48 am turned on by turndown service in an attempt to provide music for me. The wakeup call from hell from which I could not fall back to sleep. The shuttle to the casino ran only when someone was around to drive it. I didn't appreciate walking back from the casino alone at 12:25am. I would advise travelers to find other accomodations.
