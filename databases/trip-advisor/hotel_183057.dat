<Content>Great value for money We stayed in a deluxe suite at the Cambridge Suites Hotel 28-31 December 08 at a rate of approximately æ‹¢70 per night. Although the decor, fixtures and fittings aren't to the standards of a flash new hotel, we thought the extras that were included more than made up for this.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout. The suite was made up of a lounge/kitchen area with a desk, bedroom, dressing room and bathroom (with bath and shower). The kitchen had a microwave, full size fridge, mini bar, coffee maker and various utensils and items of crockery. The bathroom contained complimentary Aveda products and a powerful hairdryer, an iron and ironing board. In the lounge and bedroom were two huge plasma screens. Wifi was provided at an extremely reasonable rate. The hotel offers a free grocery delivery service and the room service plate fee was far cheaper than most hotels. Each day we were provided with a free newspaper.The 'guest services' book in each room was extremely helpful and although the hotel had a bar and restaurant (which we didn't get chance to use but they looked inviting), they allow local restaurants to deliver, ie pizzas, etc. There is also a boarding pass printing service in reception.The location is just off Yonge Street, the main street going through Toronto, and extremely close to the Eaton Centre, which is a massive shopping mall with fast food restaurants. It is a 20 minute walk to the theatres and a bit further on to the CN Tower. The hotel also scores well with their green credentials by allowing guests to elect not to have bedding and towels changed every day.I'm sure I've forgotten something but all in all, a really pleasant stay in a comfortable, friendly hotel in a great location.

<Content>I want to live here. That's an exaggeration, but really, this was a fantastic hotel. The rooms are suites in the proper sense of the word - our standard suite had 4 rooms, 2 large HD TVs, lounge with seating for 4, a microwave, fridge... And it was very cheap for the quality of service, and the location.The hotel is right next to Yonge street, so there's a huge shopping mall within 5 minutes walk, and the CN tower is a long-ish but pleasant 15 minute walk away. The view from our room was great as it was snowing, but would probably be less impressive in the summer...The lobby and halls are softly lit and feel really warm and homely. A big team of housekeepers are constantly moving about in the (insanely slow) lifts - the place feels really well looked after and well staffed. The desk and housekeeping staff were all lovely.I can't recommend this place enough, it was very relaxing, hugely spacious and great value for our money. Perfect for couples getting away to relax.

<Content>Sweet Suites at Cambridge If you are looking for an economical downtown hotel in Toronto that affords lots of space in their suites and is conveniently located to EVERYTHING then CAMBRIDGE SUITES is the place.I am a repeat guest here and usually stay at trendy boutique hotels when I travel. Although Cambridge is not that, it certainly is sufficient. The staff are friendly, the suites are spacious, the rate was competitive and the location is right on Yonge and Richmond Street.Church St is two short blocks to the East, Queen Street one block North, King Street 2 blocks South and right at Yonge Street. THE PATH leads you right into THE BAY  EATON CENTER.The beds are comfortable and suites have two flat screen tvs. Double doors to bedroom allow for more spacious feeling in the room.Nearby restaurants worth visiting: OVER EASY for Breakfast on Yonge, just below King. Colborne Lane, Spledido, Nota Bene, Rain were all awesome dining experiences and Spring Roll just two short blocks East of the hotel on Church has ecomiical Asian food.So, in your search for hotels in downtown Toronto, consider Cambridge. I love it and am sure you would too. Not pretentious, great space and value for your buck. Enjoy your Sweet stay.

<Content>A Place To Remember A place where you can go and receive outstanding service. A warm and friendly staff will greet you and take care of every need that you may have. From the minute you walk in to the moment you leave, the entire staff is there to serve you. The rooms are clean and very spacious. The fitness room is well equiped and well maintained. A safe and quiet hotel where you can take your family, have a business meeting, or even a wedding and every detail will be complete. We have been to Toronto every year for the past 5 years and this is by far the best in or around the town.A place you could call HOME.

<Content>Find Another Place Find another place. Trust me FIND ANOTHER PLACE. Loud and no frills. This a place aimed at losers on a per diem who aren't smart enough to shop ( I was one). Buy internet from the local provider for a fraction of what the hotel charges. The only sources for snacks, sodas, or water are the mini-bar or across the street before the 7/11 closes. FIND ANOTHER PLACE.

<Content>Terrific hotel Just completed a 2 day stay at the Cambridge Suites and had a great stay. The hotel location is ideal-virtually on the subway line and very close to all the major downtown attractions. It is also very easy to get to by car.The hotel staff were all friendly, helpful and professional - made us feel very welcome. The atmosphere and decor is crisp,clean and recently redecorated.The suites are large,tastefully appointed and have many extras-fresh fruit in the hallways,coffee/tea with fresh milk/cream,microwave popcorn and complimentary continental breakfast. We have stayed at many of the other downtown Toronto hotels but will make Cambridge Suites our first choice in the future

<Content>Great hotel experience, except This has been our favourite Toronto hotel for years - excellent location, friendly staff, very clean, superb restaurant, nicely furnished. But they charge $9.95 per day for Internet access  even charge for Internet access in their business centre. This in so out-of-date.We noticed too that there were no complimentary bathrobes in the room this time  the beds were not turned down in the evenings. I do hope the hotel is not going down-market.

<Content>Good location and large rooms We stayed at this hotel in mid-december and were pleasently surprised. The location is perfect (2 min to the huge Eaton Shopping Center, nice restaurants around) and the staff was always very helpful and friendly. Our suite was really nice, 2 rooms and 2 flatscreen tv, everything clean and tidy. The furnishment was new and comfortable, at night quiet in the 11th floor (minor street noise). The helpful consierge Michael organized for us tickets for a concert and theatre, even for the same evening. Internet for $ 9.95 for 24h, wireless or cable.We would really recommend this hotel and would like to stay there again.

<Content>Great Downtown Choice I spent three nights at Cambridge Suites earlier this month. I had only positive experiences. I booked a City Scape Suite on the hotel web site which put me on a higher floor with complimentary continental breakfast and unlimited Internet usage in the Business Centre. The hotel is conveniently located with easy access to the Queen subway stop. I had a nice dining experience at the Portico restaurant in the late evening on my arrival date. The suite was quiet and very well appointed. Housekeeping came twice daily and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. I had no problems with delays in the elevators that others have reported. This is an ideal choice(reasonable price, well maintained modern facility with helpful, friendly staff) in downtown that is within easy walking distances to St. Lawrence Market, Air Canada Centre, Hockey Hall of Fame and the AGO.

<Content>Cheap and Cheerful! Located just off Torontos main street Yonge,this hotel is a good option for cheap and cheerful travel in the GTA. Large suites with kitchenette,big bedrooms and lounge area. Helpful staff and good food at the Portico restaurant off the lobby.Torontos a mish-mash of a city with a certainly varied set of neighbourhoods from the good in Yorkville to the rather suspect in Kensington,either way the Cambridge Suites are a great base to centre yourself.

<Content>Delighted! There have been many reviews of this hotel so I will keep mine brief.We absolutely LOVED our stay at the Cambridge Suites Hotel. The staff were all delightful, check in was quick and accurate, our room was fantastic, we got a super rate on the Cityscape upgraded suite, and the location was PERFECT!If you like sushi, the world's best sushi restaurant is a short walk around the corner: Nami Sushi.Also a short walk away is a great breakfast restaurant: Eggspectation. It's on the outside of the Eaton Centre, so you can find some great shopping after breakfast too!We loved it so much we have already booked a suite for our next venture into Toronto on my birthday.A word about their rates: I checked a few travel websites plus the hotel's own website, then called the hotel's reservations line. I got the best rate by speaking directly with the EXTREMELY helpful and courteous reservations agent, Anne.I found it interesting that on the hotel's website, they actually have links to their reviews on TripAdvisor! (You know it's a good hotel when...) :)The reviews on here were not overrated and we have a new favourite place to stay whenever we go to TO! I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>A great experience We stayed here the weekend of December 12-14. We booked a King Bed Suite and we were very satisfied with everything about the trip. There is a parking garage with an elevator that leads directly to the lobby. We parked very close to the elevator, and always felt safe while inside. Parking is $20 per night, but the nice thing is, that on the day of your checkout, you can stay parked there until 6pm that day. That meant we could go shopping all day, then go to the car and depart. Check in was a breeze, and we were given a suite on a lower floor. My kid enjoyed the view from the window of the cars and people going by. Two big TV's and a seperate sleeping area made it nice to put the baby to sleep and then watch TV in the living area. There are several fast food places really close by, Tim Hortons, Subway is across the street, McDonalds around the corner, KFC/Taco Bell next to Tim Hortons. The Eaton Center is a very short walk. We walked there on the outside, and returned via the PATH which is completely underground, saving us the bitter cold walk back. The prices for room service seemed pretty high $17 for a tuna sandwich plus tax, gratuity and service charge, I'd expect the entire fish to arrive. We ate from local places instead.Contrary to other reviews, I found the wait for the elevators wasn't long at all. Maybe it was the fact we were on a lower floor, but we didn't wait long at all when we used them. Nice also was checkout was 1pm giving us time to relax, and pack at our pace. Really enjoyed the convenience of the coffee maker, fridge and microwave. We used them alot during our stay, and my kid enjoyed the popcorn (Orville Redenbacher, not some no name popcorn, nice touch!) All in all, we would definately stay here again, and the rates were very competitive to other hotels in the area, you really do get a lot of space for your money.

<Content>Loved the Cambridge Suites I booked two deluxe suites for me and my parents. Both rooms were of a good standard although the layouts were slightly different.The rooms were very good value for money, and are similar to a european four star. Comfortable beds (quite hard), all appliances worked fine, and the complimentary popcorn helped keep my jet lag at bay!!One of the few downsides was that the lifts were dreadfully slow, and I seemed to spend a good five minutes waiting for them each time.The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The bar was small but worked well, even if the prices were a little steep.The hotel is ideally located for sightseeing/shopping etc., and I recommend the Sunset Grill diner next door for breakfast - good value and great coffee.All in all I will definitely stay here again when I next visit Toronto with my family.

<Content>Nice Stay Spent Labor Day weekend at Cambridge Suites in Toronto. Decent but not spectacular price, but an excellent accommodation. The location was convenient for everything we wanted to do in downtown Toronto. We were able to walk everywhere, even though the wife had a broken foot in an immobilizing boot (but she's a trooper). We liked the extra room provided by a small suite. It was clean, comfortable, and quiet. Parking was on-site. We did not use public transport, but it was nearby. There was also an excellent and inexpensive breakfast restaurant across the street in the next block.

<Content>It was nice, But I booked my stay and was pleased with the location. It's right in downtown Toronto, close to the Eaton Centre.I arrived very early due to my flight and my room wasn't ready. That's ok. It was the day after American Thanksgiving and a huge holiday weekend. So I went out shopping and visited the Tim Horton's close by.I returned a few hours later and sat in the lobby. My room still wasn't ready, but I was too exhausted to go walking more. A couple came in just checked in and got thier room right away. I was confused and told  Oh they have a different type of room. When I wanted to check in, I said  Please, just a room, I'm exhausted.I got a room within 30 minutes of this and the room was ok. Note to self, check BOTH tv's when you get into the room. The 2nd tv didn't work. The room was nicely sized and a good price, especially with the exchange rate being what it was.My room was right next to the elevator, but I really couldn't hear that. What I did here were men working in the hallway outside my room while I was trying to nap. The privacy please tag was on my door.The Internet was loky. I had to call three times to have the situation taken care of. The in room coffee maker didn't work. Which again, no big deal since there's Tim Horton's across the street. But still its the point. I found the front desk clerks condescending, especially when I asked about the airline check in.If you're looking for a centrally located hotel, this is ok. But there's a few other hotels up Yonge Street and off Carleton I plan on checking out when I come back.

<Content>Horrible - false advertising of king beds Was one of the most unpleasant hotel stays I've had. I booked a deluxe king-size bed suite and was not told it was not guaranteed as their website states double beds are an extra charge. Well, I'm not sure what kind of 'double beds' they have but they are MUCH narrower than a full size bed and are very uncomfortable. Pillows were awful as well. We were going for a romantic getaway but couldn't even sleep in the same bed - and we're not big people. Location was great but I think they failed at providing basic needs. Plus I came home to a mini bar charge on my credit card (which we definitely did not use) and so I had to call to dispute the charge. They were not unpleasant about this but it was just an added nuisance.

<Content>The Best of Toronto After a great deal of research, my family and I decided to stay at the Cambridge Suites hotel and loved every minute. The hotel's location is central to everything downtown including: shopping, restaurants, tourist attractions and the underground. We felt very safe walking around at all times of the day and the room was clean and spacious. The restaurant downstairs is very good, but I would not recommend the hamburger when ordering room service. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable. The main selling points of the hotel are the large suite and the location. Keep in mind that the suites need a little rehab, (new faucets, carpet and a more comfortable bed, I actually liked the bed but my parents thought it was a bit too firm) however, nothing that would deter me from staying here. I am pretty picky about where I stay and this hotel passed the test. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a nice, quiet room at a reasonable price.

<Content>Felt like home The service made staying at this hotel a good experience. However, I agree with other travellers that this shouldn't be a 4 star hotel. The room was clean and welcoming, but it was the little things that I noticed. When attempting to open a curtain, I found out that the rod wasn't even attached. The decorative piece in the bathroom faucet wasn't attached either, and the toilet had trouble flushing down toilet paper.However, the bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable. The televisions (2!) were large flatscreens. There was a large counter space in the dressing room which allowed me to spread out my makeup when getting ready to go out. The curtains blocked out light completely.I also have to note though, that it was not soundproof. Other occupants starting showers in other rooms woke me up while sleeping due to the loud noises. We could hear televisions and laughter through the walls and ceiling. The noise from outside wasn't incredibly loud though, despite only being a few floors up and directly above the entrance.I can't say enough about the staff, though. They were incredibly helpful and welcoming, and always smiling. It made me relax as soon as I stepped through the door. It's the staff that made this an above-average stay.

<Content>Great location, nice little lobby bar Stayed here on businessRooms: Really good size. En-suite bathroom and small living room (can easily fit a friend on the couch!). Not the most modern of styles, however, size is really good.Service: Decent - as you would expect really.Food: Ate a couple of times at restaurant. Decent, but nothing to write home about. Lobby bar is fairly intimate and worth a drink. Breakfast was average.Location: Good - within walking distance to all the main downtown offices and the shopping centers.Facilities: Wifi in the rooms I think. Didn't use gym, etc...

<Content>Great Hotel I booked this hotel after reading the reviews and knowing it score #5 hotel in Toronto and I must say it deserve the high ratings, large rooms with kitchen, free sauna and gym on the top and great location, just 10 min walk to union Station and CN tower. Don't expect to view the skyline as the hotel is not very tall and it's surrounded by offices.

<Content>recommended without reservation I stayed at the Cambridge Suites for a conference downtown and was pleasantly surprised. I found it to be clean, spacious, and the service was quite friendly/helpful. Also, the room (19th floor) was EXTREMELY quiet. I never heard any noise from the hallway or adjacent rooms, nor did I hear any from the street below.The beds are quite comfortable as well. The mattress seemed to be higher in quality and firmer than typical hotel mattresses.I really recommend this hotel highly. I'm used to staying in the Ritz and Four Seasons chains and am a bit fussy about hotels, but I really have no faults I could point out with this hotel.

<Content>Great find Found this hotel through trip advisor and I have to say it lived up to the hype. Great location downtown, only a couple of blocks from the main shopping area and restaurants. Massive rooms or suites rather. Very comfy beds, large bathrooms and 2 TVs in each suite! Even the kitchenette was cute even though we didn't really use it.There is also a car park there, the charge is around $20 per day. Anyway, highly recommended. Would def stay here again.

<Content>Great Room  my husband  I spent this past weekend in Toronto  stayed at the Cambridge Suites for 2 nights. it's definitely a good location - on Richmond btwn Yonge  Church..we were able to walk everywhere we went. about a 20 min walk to the Bloor shopping area, 15 mins to the CN tower or entertainment dist. we felt very safe walking around at night after dinner. the staff was extremely nice  helpful. they gave us simple, accurate directions to anywhere we needed  offered great recommendations for restaurants. the conceirge also gave us numerous amazing recommendations for dinner  nightlife. we ate at Terroni and Fuzion - both highly recommended..great environments, delectable cuisine..Fuzion is swanky and offers a menu with the not-so-usual fare. Rex Hotel is great for live jazz. our suite was great -- spacious, clean  comfortable. the bathroom itself is a little snug (does have a huge vanity area) but hopefully you're not in Toronto to spend too much time in the shower, etc. fitness room was mediocre - but it did the job. there's a nice hot tub  sauna for those interested. all in all, would definitely recommend this property  consider staying there again!

<Content>Great sense of occasion, but a tiny bit underwhelming I booked this hotel solely on the reviews on this site. I was not disappointed and we loved the whole suite thing for the price of a ( very good) city hotel room.Pleasant arrival with genuinely friendly staff throughout - a good vibe. The suite was lovely and spotless and great fun if you want to play hide  seek with your partner. The room has a proper suite feel with plenty of complimentaries refreshed regularly. Only criticism of the room is that it looks a teeny-weeny bit dated in comparison to many new hotels - but it didn't spoil our stay.If you think you're going to get proper five star luxury, this place could possibly disappoint, but if you get a deal on a cityscape room as I did (with a few extras  breakfast), this place will compliment your visit to the city and give you a hotel stay to remember.

<Content>Great location, large suites My wife and I were in Toronto over Labour Day weekend for a wedding. We arrived well before the 4pm check-in, but the friendly person at the front desk was able to accomodate us. The location is great, walking distance to Eaton Centre, the train station, the Hockey Hall of Fame and sporting venues. The room was huge, and free popcorn was a nice treat. They will even go out and buy groceries for you if you wish (we weren't that lazy). The room was very clean too. Only downsides are limited room service hours and no in-house drycleaning. Still, this is a great deal at a very good ( well under $200 a night) price, and we intend to make Cambridge Suites our place to stay when in town. Highly recommended.

<Content>Fanatastic City We have just returned from Canada where we stayed in the Cambridge suites for 3 nights. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. They are very large although it is a suite so to be expected really. Its location is along the main streets for bars and clubs which are about 10 mins walk from the hotel. There is a massive shopping centre literally around the corner called the eaton centre. There are no real bad points but the rooms do look a little dated and the bathrooms are a little small but nothing to cause any concern. I would recommend this hotel to anyone although it is not a 5 star so go somewhere else if it is luxury you are after. Niagara should definitely be visited from Toronto and is an hour and half drive. There are loads of guided tours from the city or rent a car and drive there (the QEW runs from toronto to Niagara). We also visted Killarney park and camped for 5 days. I would fully recommend visiting one of the parks if you have the time (about 4 to 5 hours from toronto). We chose this over Algonquin park due to recommendations and were not dissappointed. If you would like any more info about the provincial parks or any questions send me a msg and I will try and help if I can.

<Content>Warmly recommended My wife and 3 teenagers had 2 nights in Toronto and we were very pleased with the Cambridge. The rooms are a good size, its well located, there is easy parking and the staff are helpful. It has a nice bar and smart looking restaurant, although with plenty of local restaurants to choose from we didn't use it. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel for Toronto Great hotel that is located off the main street, but still in close proximity to shops, restaurants, and the hustle and bustle of town. The hotel really tries to showcase as a first class hotel even though the building is older. The front desk is very friendly and helpful. All the rooms are decked out as suites with a separate living room from the bedroom. Both rooms have flat screen tvs and aveda toiletries. They even have snacks like popcorn, candy, etc for you to choose from. It's part of their snack bar, but definitely different than just the run of the mill hotel. In the evening, they bring up some complimentary cookies and bottled water. It was also our anniversary and they left a box of chocolates to show that they were thinking of us and had a pleasant stay. Their parking garage is one of the cheapest parking prices in the city too.The only downside I could say is that they don't have a pool, the walls can be thin (but with the living room, it blocks out the noise), no breakfast buffet, and sometimes waiting a long time for the elevator. But, this are only minor things.

<Content>Great Hotel I, my wife, and daughter booked the Cambridge Suites while enjoying a two day stay in Toronto. We have stayed in Toronto many times and thought we would try a different stay this time. We thought the Cambridge Suites was excellent. We have stayed before at the Intercontinental, Royal York, Delta, etc and never had too much problems. But in my opinion, Cambridge Suites was by far superior. Generally reasonably priced (for downtown Toronto), great location, and lovely large rooms. If you are travelling with a child the nice thing is that you can plonk your child in the pull-out sofa bed, turn on her own 37 LCD TV, shut the doors to your room, lie out on your king bed and watch your own 37 LCD TV. Ahhh, heaven. Strongly recommend this hotel.

<Content>No Complaints from us My wife and I stayed at the hotel last weekend to watch the Redsox play the jays.The hotel is in a very good location. You can walk either way on richmond st and find restaurants and bars. About a 5-7 minute walk will get you to richmond and john st where there is alot of action.The hotel itself is very clean and the people were very nice and helpful. Parking is right underneath the hotel for $18 a day. Our room was great. we were in suite 1503. It really has an apartment feel to it with two big flat screen tv's, nice size bathroom and big bedroom. The bed was a little harder than i usually like but had no issues with it or the temperature in the room. They do have a sink, microwave and refrigerator in the room as well. Wife and I really enjoyed our room and would stay there again.two small small minor things. one...the elevators take forever to get to you and then they stop on every floor. two, in the business center you have to pay for internet access. its hardly a complaint at all, just putting it out therewould stay here again if we go to Toronto!

<Content>Very Nice Indeed I'd pretty much agree with all the positive comments from the other reviewers.The hotel doesn't actually look all that wonderful on approaching it, but is one of those places that is much, much nicer inside.Parking is very convenient, right next to the hotel and there is an elevator directly into the hotel from the parking garage.We tried to check in early, but our room was not ready, but the receptionist (who was most charming and professional) said that she would call us when it was ready and that she would 'have a rush put on it'. Past experience in such circumstances made me think that she probably had good intentions, but would forget - but she called an hour and a half before the designated check in time of 4.00pm to inform us our room was infact ready - I was definitely impressed. When we did check in our room was lovely - we had a top floor corner suite with lots of windows and everything was just as other reviewers have described.There was also an invitation to the Manager's Reception that evening (every Wednesday) where free drinks and hot and cold snacks are provided, which was a nice surprise also.Location is excellent too. I had thought that maybe the riverfront area of Toronto might be preferable, but after exploring I think that this location is the best and within pretty easy walking distance of most things.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>The suites are sweet! The Cambridge Suites is tough to top. My wife and I just returned from a four-night stay and enjoyed the hotel. The only surprise was that I thought breakfast was included. It was not -- perhaps because we booked through hotels.com and got the room for $168 a night. My advice: Go for the deal, skip the hotel's $20 breakfast, and eat at the place across the street (I forgot its name), which advertises a decent breakfast for $3.99. Or there's a McDonald's a quarter-block away. Or eat in the room (plates and silverware are in the cupboard).My only other complaint was that internet access was $10 a day -- fine if you're traveling on a business expense account (as many of the guests clearly are), but steep for pleasure seekers like us who have gotten used to reading restaurant reviews while traveling, not beforehand.But the suite's layout was perfect -- two new wide-screen TVs, 70 cable channels, beautiful bathroom, comfortable living room area, fridge and microwave (with free popcorn). The king bed was oh so comfortable. The place was super quiet. I used the small gym's free weights every morning after a run. There's a whirlpool and sauna too.And the location is perfect -- not immediately next to anything of interest, but very close to pretty much everything you'd want to see.All in all, an experience somewhere between above average and excellent. We'd stay again and recommend it.

<Content>Customer service beyond compare! My husband and I just completed a five night stay at the best hotel in Toronto! We have stayed at others over the years, but none that made us feel so welcomed. Our room was very comfortable and spacious with a separate bedroom area.The turn down service in the evening came complete with chocolates and bottles of water. There was a microwave (for the complimentary popcorn), coffeemaker (with additional teapot for the non-coffee drinkers), and refrigerator which was stocked with actual cream for the coffee/tea (not the usual powdered creamer). The attention to detail was refreshing, to say the least. Extra coffee packets were delivered within minutes with a smile and a question if anything more could be done. The front desk staff were very friendly and accomodating. All of the staff we encountered actually looked happy and greeted us warmly! We definitely will make this our choice hotel in the future and will heartily recommend it to others.

<Content>You must stay @ Cambridge Suites! I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Toronto. The layout of the rooms are fantastic. There's separate living room space and sleeping space as well as a small kitchenette featuring a sink, two fridges [one is the mini-bar] and a microwave. There were some complimentary treats like water, candy, and microwave popcorn to greet us.The thing I loved was the room layout. The sleeping space was separated by two french doors off of the living room. There was a dressing room area where the bathroom sink was located and the tub and commode in a separate room off of that. The space was larger than many NYC apts and calling the hotel direct I was able to get a very affordable rate for a cityscape room. I also suggest checking out their website because they have promotions there.The staff is super professional and warm. Rooms are spotless. Also two gigantic flat screen televisions in both the living room and bedroom.It was a fantastic stay! I will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Very pleased with Cambridge Suites Just returned from Toronto and wanted to say how much I enjoyed my stay at the Cambridge Suites. My suite was very comfortable with bar, microwave, fridge, and 2 TV's. Best of all was the layout - each sleeping area is private and totally separate from the other.Every day coffee, cookies, popcorn and bottled water are delivered to your room - gratis. The staff could not have been nicer. Location is very good - close to Queen Street, Yonge Street and subways. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good Hotel in Heart of Downtown Toronto We just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel and liked it very much. As the name iindicates, it is an all-suites hotel and is a very comfortable place to return to after a day of sightseeing. The suite we had was a decent size corner suite with a living room area equipped with a wet bar and refrigerator. The bed was comfortable and both the living room area and bedroom had flat panel TVs.Amenities included terry bathrobes and toiletries. The size of the bathroom was good but the counter space alongside the sink could have been a bit larger. Included in the rate is a very ample continental breakfast which includes cereals, fresh and dried fruit, yogurts and breads. The hotel was a few blocks from the subway and there is a lot of shopping nearby. The concierge and front desk staff were very helpful and accommodating.

<Content>Wonderful hotel I spend one week every five or six in Toronto and was looking for a place I could feel comfortable and safe. Since I work long hours, even when I'm not in the office in Toronto, I'm working and I hate feeling as though I'm stuck in my bedroom all week long.The Cambridge Suites Hotel was wonderful. The living room area was comfortable with a nice, large desk for working. The bedroom area was fine for me and the bed was very comfortable. There was very good light in both room. Most hotel rooms are too warm for me, so I loved being able to adjust the temperature to my comfort level. There was a nice large bathroom. I loved having televisions in each room.As a woman traveling, the biggest challenge in putting on makeup. There was not a good, naturally lit place with a mirror to put in makeup, so I improvised, as usual. But that's a small., and common problem with most hotels.The service was excellent. My room was always clean when I returned at night, the housekeeper even gave me extra cookies one night. I find Toronto quite dry and painful for my sinuses. I asked whether they might have a humidifier and nice large one was in my room when I returned that night.I generally eat a very light dinner while I work at night, and the kitchen was wonderful about accommodating me. Basically they told me they could make me pretty much whatever I wanted as long as they had the ingredients.I am going back to Toronto in two weeks and you can bet I am staying at Cambridge Suites again.

<Content>Great stay! Just got back from 3 nights at the Cambridge Suites in Toronto and had a fantastic stay! We had a standard suite with King bed. The suite was roomy and clean. The bed was on the firm side, but to me that's a good thing; very comfortable.The restaurant was still closed for renovations but that was okay. We'd recommend two restaurants very close to the hotel on Richmond East: Golden Thai and Harlem. Both were very good meals.The staff were warm and very helpful. We asked for restaurant recommendations for our last night and Stuart came back to us later that day with printouts of three great restaurants and their reviews. The place we picked was exactly what we were looking for that night.The location of the hotel is great; Yonge Street is just to your left when you exit the hotel; Queen Street is one block north. We walked all around Queen Street West, Theatre district, etc. The only thing that could've made the trip better would be if it were warmer outside! We would definitely stay at the Cambridge Suites again.

<Content>HIghly recommended We just came back from 6 nights at the Cambridge Suites.The whole stay was wonderful. The staff was very helpful and nice. Our flight arrived early in the morning and we could check in right away and have breakfast without a problem. The suite was spacious and well equipped. We had a shower and a bathtub; I liked the Aveda bath products.The continental breakfast was ample. The location made it perfect for our exploring without a car; within minutes from subway, bus and streetcars and the great PATH system. We will stay there again!

<Content>Pretty Good Stayed there with my husband and toddler on Dec 15th. Got a great rate on Hotwire and had heard a lot about it so was anxious to see it.Room is a suite which was great. Had a king bed in one room, living area with kitchenette and couch in another room, a dressing room/power room and a small bathroom. Decor is pretty dated and the tv was very old and kept changing colour. Very centrally located and can get to the Eaton Ctr without going outside. Had dinner at the restaurant there. Food was excellent. Breakfast was included in our rate and that was good too.All in all the stay over was good and I'd go back again. Its classified on hotwire as a 4 star which I wouldn't agree with. I think that its more a 3 star. Saying that we got a great rate and it was really suitable for us.

<Content>Spacious, clean and centrally located A spacious room with king bed, clean and quiet with complimentary breakfast to boot! Friendly staff. Don't let the fact that it is billed as being in business/financial sector throw you off. Walking on the street (rather than the tunnel connections) takes: 5 minutes to subway, 10 minutes to Eaton centre; 10 minutes to the Hilton and restaurants etc. Train station is 10 minutes by taxi (less than 10$ with tip!) Central and secure. Wouldn't recommend taking car since parking is rare and expensive even at this hotel. We used an agency on the Internet to book and we had absolutely no problems -saved a bundle too!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! After some careful research, I finally decided to stay at the Cambridge Suites Hotel in Toronto for my 3 day trip for a convention. I had never been to Toronto nor had anyone that I knew that had been so I had to go on guesswork alone. I guessed quite well!!! This hotel is exactly what it states - suites. All rooms have a view and all rooms are ample suites. I had a sitting room, bedroom and bathroom all in a circle like layout. A unique layout but it definately worked. The bed was very comfortable!!! I also really liked that in addition to the usual complimentary coffee, they also had tea, cookies and popcorn! Also included with your stay is a contenential breakfast that is more than ample! The location of the hotel is also pefect, you can nearly walk to anywhere you need to go in downtown Toronto. The mall is quite close and in colder months you can access it via the underground. Finally you must try the restaurant on site, it's divine!!!

<Content>Practical but dated, good location but there are better hotels close by Rooms looked at bit dated having just spent 4 night in a spacious and modern suite in the Cosmopolitan for just $40 more. Both TV's in sofa area and room were old, both had display problems such as picture turning green wherreas Cosmopolitan had two brand new flat screen TV's for both rooms. Air conditioning was noisy. We also were annoyed at arriving at 10am in the morning and had to wait till 4pm till a room was available even though we called back twice, 1st time room wasnt available, 2nd time room was free but stank of smoke (non smoking room) so was told sorry but come back later, any other hotel would have upgraded us, but oh well.No one was impressive, we mentioned it was our honeymoon but the man behind the desk wasn't very friendly and didn't even say congratulations, unlike the Sheraton which gave us that plus a surprise bottle of wine.Im honestly not surprised about the good reviews for this hotel, its pretty good, but having spent a bit of time in 3 other hotels, there is better out there for the money. Cosmopolitan was the best hotel I ever stayed in!

<Content>lovely rooms, plenty space We visited Toronto with friends to visit my daughter who is staying in Canada, and was in Toronto at that time. Extremely comfortable beds, slept like a baby every night! Separate bedroom, dressing area, and lounge made this hotel very likable indeed. I wouldn't say it was the height of luxury, but I couldn't fault it either. The maid service was very good, morning and turn down service at night. At night time the maid also left us a little card with the next days weather forecast on it, as well as several little chocolates at the side of the bed. The free breakfast is a great idea, and you are encouraged to take a tray to the breakfast room and take whatever you like back to your room, or you can sit there in the sunny breakfasting room if you choose. If I go back to Toronto, I'd book it again!

<Content>High expectations rewarded My adult daughter and I stayed at this very conveniently located hotel for a weekday night prior to getting back in the fall school/work routine. We were upgraded to the 20th floor and enjoyed a corner room view of the city. Delightful. Suite and bath were spacious with invitingly comforting pillows and comforters. Aveda products nice to try, and the snacks and mini-bar offerings were appreciated. Breakfast was pleasant and they make it easy to transport coffee and food back to the room. The staff was always pleasant and helpful when questions were asked. We'll be back again and will be certain to stay at the Cambridge Suites!

Airport.Faults = The breakfast room- gets a bit crowded in the morning - get there early and parking CAD$ 17 a day.Other than that would stay there again.

<Content>Great location Stayed six nights early July. Large suite providing plenty of room for a couple. Nice extra complimentary touches such as bottled water, bathrobes etc. Great location with easy access to transport system, shops and easy walk to main attractions. Breakfast more than adequate though room can get overcrowded. Staff attentive, friendly and ready to always provide advice etc. Would return.

<Content>Nice suite hotel A very compact, efficient suite which was able to accommodate my wife and four kids. Would also be a nice option for a business traveller. Everything was clean and well maintained. Fitness center and whirlpool overlook the city. Hotel is located in the financial district but very close to many shopping options, including the Eaton Center.

<Content>Good Hotel, Great Location. We stayed here for 3 nights in early July, 2007.The suite we stayed in was perfectly adequate (clean, spacious 2 rooms) but it was nothing that you could get excited about - it felt like any of a number of business hotels that I've stayed in.However, the location is very good providing you a great starting place to discover a lot of Toronto by foot and, from that perspective, the hotel is a great place to be.There was a complimentary breakfast service on one of the hotel floors which seemed to be pretty chaotic so (after one attempt) we gave that a miss. Recommendation if you stay here is to walk out of the door, turn up the street and visit the Sunset Grill for breakfast - fantastic place to start the day :-)In summary - it's a good place to stay but don't expect to get excited about the hotel or its rooms. They're clean, spacious and functional.

<Content>Very good all-round hotel in excellent location Another UK reviewer here and unlike thingummyjig a few days below, I thoroughly recommend it. I actually stayed on my own, so æ‹¢100 per night is a bit steep per night, but a sizeable, well-appointed and well decorated suite for a family of 4, given its location and the breakfast thrown in, is a veritable bargain.Breakfast was well-stocked (good juice, bagels, toast, fruit, yoghurts, coffee, danish pastries) and moderately busy, but always a table there for people.Staff very friendly and helpful, and actually added to my stay by recommending nearby restaurants/bars to meet up with friends in and also a whole bunch of local take-aways when I stayed in after landing. In-house restaurant also served up good, if maybe slightly expensive food.Beds are absolutely superb. Only gripes are the lack of shower gel (although this may just be a UK staple in hotels) and lifts being slow on occasions!

<Content>Luxurious suites Spent 5 nights at the Cambridge and was delighted with the standard of suite and the location. It's just off Yonge Street.The suites have a king size bed in the bedroom and a pull out double bed in the living area. Included was fridge, sink, microwave and mini bar. It was so well equiped and spacious it was like staying in an apartment within an excellent hotel. What was exceptional was the complimentary breakfasts, the turn down service at night which included bottles of water and mints and the staffs friendliness and helpfulness. Nothing was too much bother.Top class hotel and suites!!

<Content>Comfortable at the Cambridge Suites Comfortable Suite Hotel.Rooms are furnished with coffeemaker, useful microwave and small fridge and some cutlery,plates,bowls and cups - also kettle and toaster available on request.Helpful,efficient, friendly staff and unobtrusive maid service.Continental buffet breakfast is fine but this finishes at 9am on weekday mornings which seems a little early and sometimes there are queues from 8.15am and the staff may have problems with keeping things stocked.Guests are allowed to take breakfast on a tray to their room.Lots of green apples available for guests each morning in the corridors and reception( only green ones ).View of the city from exercise room is lovely.We would be quite happy to stay here again.

<Content>good hotel in a great location We stayed at the Cambridge Suites for one night during July 2007.Considering this hotel is located in Downtown Toronto, the apartment room we had was a very good size with a seperate living room area and mini kitchen.The location is great with the Eaton Center virtually opposite the hotel and is easily accessible.The few slight criticisms I have:1)- Breakfast area......its far too small (although you can take breakfast to your room)and the queues were very long. Whilst it did seem that the staff were doing their best to refill the food items, it did seem to take ages........2)- The room that we had albeit very clean did feel a bit outdated....However, a good hotel overall.

<Content>Nothing to rave about Spent 4 nights here. This is really a functional, rather dull business-style hotel . The suites are spacious and the beds and fresh white linens wonderfully comfortable, but the decor overall could certainly do with a bit of an update. Missed not having a safe in the room. The bath/shower area in our suite was dimly lit.The front desk was brisk and efficent, but staff were not particularly warm or friendly.The breakfast room was chaotic and overcrowded so we just took a tray up to our room every day. Overall, reasonable value for money, just don't build your expectations up too much.

<Content>Top notch! Stayed for 8 nights on business trip and hotel could not be faulted.Excellent accomodation - spacious and spotless complimented by a staff team of supreme professionalism and,believe it or not,old fashioned kindness.Suffice to say,was impressed by the city enough to want to return for holiday and,if so, would unconditionally recommend the Cambridge Suites to myself!

<Content>Loved the Cambridge suites. Reviewer from Devon, England.Cambridge suites exceeded our expectations. An apartment in the city where rooms were clean and spacious. Staff were friendly and very helpful. English visitors would probably like a kettle in the room rather than just a coffee maker, but kettles are available on request. Continental breakfast was very good.Location handy for visting Eaton Centre and City Hall. Most places you might want to visit were accessible on foot or public transport. Would certainly recommend it to others.

<Content>Nice suite hotel in a good location I stayed at this hotel while attending a large meeting at the Conference Centre. While the conference provided buses from this and other hotels, it was more efficient to do the 15-20 minute walk back and forth. This walk, incidentally, can be done underground and inside buildings the whole way if you are there during bad weather. It is not the most convenient hotel for the Conference Centre but definitely convenient to what appears to be the Times Square of Toronto, the area near Queen and Yonge, where there is the best shopping and other tourist venues. It is close to the Hockey Hall of Fame and a reasonable walk to the theater district. I did not experience any of the problems some other reviewers complained about. I believe this hotel has undergone substantial renovation recently. My room was immaculate, the bed quite comfortable, the two TVs fine, and no odor of smoke and certainly no mold. The check-in was quick and service friendly. I did not find the elevators particularly slow. Though I was above the 10th floor but below the more expensive rooms at the top of the building, there was some unadvoidable traffic noise from the street, but not too bothersome. I was on the street side of the hotel away from the neighboring building. Those who hate all noise can ask to have the trade-off of being in a quieter room on the side next to the neighboring building. The view on the street side is not all that nice anyway--just some city streets--so you aren't missing much if you get the blocked view some others have mentioned. Others complained about the small lobby--so what? Who wants to spend time in the lobby when there is a nice suite to spend time in? I'd rather the hotel spend its money on the rooms than a fancy lobby that one is likely just to pass through. There is a nice large hot tub and a small fitness center on the top floor, I for one prefer this to a pool anyway. The breakfast room is too small to handle all the guests if the hotel is full, and to compensate for this you can ask to have free delivery of breakfast to your room, a clever way for the hotel to get around this problem. Breakfast was okay, fairly standard fare. The Eaton Centre has a nice market where you can buy take-out food to heat in your room's microwave and store in the refrigerator for an evening you want to relax inside the suite. Parking is an extra $16; across the street was a cheaper parking lot, but I preferred the safety of my car inside a garage. I am a very experienced traveler and have had rooms as nice as this one elsewhere. I was satisfied with everything but the price and the fact that internet was an extra $10 for 24 hrs rather than being included. Our conference organization did not do a very good job negotiating prices with any of the Toronto hotels; I could have gotten a better price by calling the hotel directly instead of booking through the conference at what was supposedly good rates. I would stay here at another trip to Toronto if I could get a good price on this hotel (though if I was attending a conference, I'd aim to be closer to the Centre next time; those hotels were already booked, however).

<Content>Comfortable place in the heart of Toronto I would stay here again. You feel like you have your own apartment in the city.Location: This is a great location for sightseeing in Toronto -- very centrally located. It was a bit further to the Convention Center than I liked (a 15 minute walk at a very brisk pace). Pros: The rooms were huge -- with a separate large bedroom and living area (each with its own TV). The bed was firm and comfortable. The kitchenette with complimentary tea, hot cocoa, coffee, cookies, microwave popcorn and real cups/utensils was a nice touch. There are two robes for your use as well. In business center, you can print things for free (off of a USB, but you pay for the internet). The staff were courteous, friendly, and helpful. Free continental breakfast was nice. The food available was just average -- but they did have good variety (various juices, coffee, yogurt, cereal, dried fruit, bagels, bread, pasteries). It was definitely enough to start your day. And even if you showed up 15 minutes before the breakfast ended, they still had a full selection (it was constantly replenished).I really liked the complimentary bottle of water they offered every night along with a card describing the weather conditions for the next day. Cons (all minor): The towels were not fluffy -- they were a bit on the rough side. Unlike other hotels, they don't provide complimentary shaving cream, razors, or toothbrushes through the front desk -- but that is available for purchase as part of the minibar selection. The internet service costs $9.95 a day (whereas I'm used to hotels like this offering that free). The elevators were very slow and I sometimes waited close to 10 minutes. I was on the 5th floor and did hear some street noise (nothing out of the ordinary though). There wasn't much of a view from the window. I found the thermostat difficult to adjust. All in all, though -- I'd recommend this place for anyone who wants a good location in downtown Toronto and wants some of the comforts of home.

<Content>Very nice place This is a nice downtown hotel, within a short walk to many downtown sites and the subway system. I took the subway to the Toronto convention centre (3 stops away), and easily walked back to the hotel at the end of the day.I enjoyed the suite (one bedroom, separate living room with microwave and counter to make coffee etc). The air conditioner was not as loud as most hotels, and not much street noise. The hotel was very clean.The continental breakfast buffet had quite a few choices. It was definitely enough to get your day started.There is a Subway sandwich store right accross the street from the hotel. Underground indoor car garage cost $16 per 24hr, with full in/out privileges and no annoying valet to deal with.I would gladly stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Cambridge We stayed at the Cambridge Suites Hotel for a weekend. The rooms were spacious and clean with a big and very comfortable bed. We were upgraded to a room on the 21st floor and had a great view of the city. We had complimentary breakfast included which, while basic, was adequate. The location is also fantastic as it is one block from the Eaton Center and other attractions of the city. We will definitely stay there again if we go back.

<Content>Best bang for your buck in Toronto If your are looking for the best bang for your buck hotel in downtown Toronto, then Cambridge Suites is the place for you. The rooms are huge with a separate bedroom and living room. Thereéˆ¥æªš a kitchenette complete with sink, fridge, and even dishes and cutlery. There is a bathroom/dressing room with nice toiletries. Every night you get complimentary bottle of water, popcorn, cookies, chocolate and a card detailing the weather for the next day. Thereéˆ¥æªš even a complimentary continental breakfast which serves coffee/tea, juices, fresh fruit, pastries, cereal, yogurt, etc. No hot eggs or waffles, but itéˆ¥æªš more than enough to get you started each day. The best part of this hotel is its location. Itéˆ¥æªš located right in downtown Toronto in the financial district. I was here on business, so getting to work only took a 5min walk. Eaton Centre is only 1 block away. If you get sick of the many food courts, there are lots of places to eat on Yonge and Queen. The only negative I have is that thereéˆ¥æªš no pool. There is a Jacuzzi, but itéˆ¥æªš very small and itéˆ¥æªš in the same room as the small gym and sauna. This is a great place to stay for business travelers and I would also stay here if I was just visiting Toronto.

<Content>Meets expectations I was impressed by the reviews on this hotel and booked one night stay on March 17, 2007. I called the hotel directly and was lucky to get a great deal - 140CAD for Deluxe King Suite including deluxe breakfast for two. It is really hard to add anything to what has been already posted here about this hotel. I agree with the previous positive reviews but I wanted to add that this is not a true 4 star hotel. I would assign it solid 3+ or 4- but you cannot compare this hotel with Intercontinental or Park Hyatt. It is a modest hotel with perfect service, clean and great for big families but the quality of their suites (bathroom , furniture, linen etc.) doesn't come close to four star.It is a great deal for 140CAD but I wouldn't pay more than this for Cambridge Suites.

<Content>Cambridge Suites, one of the best Just returned from a trip to Toronto to celebrate our daughters Sweet 16. From the moment we walked into the Cambridge Suite Hotel until the moment we left ,we had nothing but the friendliest, most welcoming and helpful staff I have ever met. The rooms were good size and the king size bed was VERY comfortable. They had 6 very big and fluffy pillows which made for a great pillow fight. The turn down service with the complimentary water and chocolate was a great bonus. The staff was quick to help us find our way around and helped us with last minute dinner arrangements. Check in and out was very easy . There was a large wedding going on but you would never know it as noise did not travel through the walls or floors. The continental breakfast was constantly being refreshed by a very attentive staff so there was always a good assortment.I wouldn't stay anywhere else. I strongly recommend the Cambridge Suites.

<Content>Very Nice Downtown Hotel I stayed at the Cambridge Suites for two nights and had a wonderful experience. I booked a package through Expedia and chose a Deluxe Suite. It was spacious, clean and comfortable. The room had a small bar with a sink and microwave as well as a coffeemaker, dishes and glasses. The hotel provides complimentary coffee and tea supplies as well as a small package of chocolate chip cookies and a package of microwave popcorn daily.The room had a good sized living area with a desk/chair, a sofa and armchair and a small TV. The separate bedroom had a very comfortable king sized bed with four large, comfortable pillows. There was a slightly larger TV in the bedroom and a small desk area with a lamp. The bathroom was divided into a large dressing area with a sink and a huge mirror. The bathtub and toilet were in a separate area. All was clean and well maintained.All of the staff that I encountered were courteous. The hotel provides a basic continental breakfast and they also give you a tray if you want to take things back to your room. There is a restaurant on the premises that provides room service, but I didn't try it.As far as location, you don't get much more central than this hotel. The Eaton Centre is just a couple blocks away and so is the subway. All of the theatres are close by. The best thing is that in the building across the courtyard from the hotel is the Toronto PATH. This is an underground walkway that connects many downtown buildings, shopping malls and subway stations so you can move around easily in even the worst weather. The PATH is very easy to navigate, very clean and felt very safe.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would definitely stay again!

<Content>Loved Cambridge Suites Found Cambridge Suites online and because of excellent reviews, decided to stay there. We arrived 15 minutes before our dinner reservations at Ruth's Chris Steak house (would highly recommend as well!) and the reception staff was very friendly, quick to check us in and helpful in getting us to the restaurant on time. A free shuttle was called for us immediately and we made our reservation with time to spare. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. We enjoyed the complimentary snacks in the room and the bottled water and chocolates delivered to us in the evening. These are just a few of the nice touches that this hotel has to offer. We paid $149 CDN and we felt that that was excellent value for our money as we have paid much more money for hotels not nearly as nice and clean as this one.

<Content>Home away from home I believe this is an all-suite hotel, and we were in one of the smaller suites. It was absolutely beautiful. The amenities were plentiful and happily replenished as often as we requested, as well as on their regular daily routine. The staff was consistently friendly, warm, and helpful.As this was just before Christmas the hotel was decorated throughout all public areas, and the lobby was a joy to pass through, with an elegantly-decorated tree.The location could not have been better, both for business and pleasure. We were short walking distance from where we were doing business, as well as being very close to the Eaton Centre.The bar staff went above and beyond in hospitality. I wish I had written this immediately after the trip when my memory was clearer, as there was one member of the bar staff, a woman whose name I can't now recall, who made me feel as if I was simultaneously their best customer and her best friend.Although not a five-star hotel, I truly believe this was one of our very best hotel experiences - and we have had many hotel experiences due to business travel.I HIGHLY recommend staying at the Cambridge Suites. I hope to have the opportunity to stay here again myself in the future.

<Content>Excellent value, great location and really nice staff We stayed here from December 29th to Jan 5th and we found the Cambridge Suites to be a first class place to stay if you are visting Toronto. The Suites themselves are clean and spacious to a European eye and the bed was one of the most comfortable that we had slept in and it was huge!Cambridge Suites are located right near the main shopping area and a shortish walk to the harbourfront. We only took transit twice during our stay and the rest of the time we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.The staff couldn't have been nicer and were incredibly helpful particularly in getting us a better rate for our hire car when we travelled out of town. Also when we discovered that we couldn't collapse the ironing board after use they were on to it straight away. We stayed at the Suites over New Year and we found out that unlike a lot of hotel the Suites do not book out rooms for single nights at times like New Year to make sure that they are not used for noisy parties. We thought that this was very considerate of other guests.WeI would thoroughly recommend the Suites and will be staying there the next time we are in Toronto.

<Content>Customer Service and Festive Smiles We have just returned from 10 days staying at this great Downtown hotel for our honeymoon, whilst it's possibly not the most luxurious hotel compared to some it was perfect! Very clean and with the added advantage of a seperate sitting room with small fridge and microwave if you didn't want to go out. After a horrific flight from the UK, the staff couldn't have been friendlier, a special mention must go to Jennifer who worked on the concierge desk, 110% helpful all the time. The breakfast was simple but with the option of going down and getting your own before taking it to your room. On arrival as we were on our honeymoon we were upgraded so we were on the 21st floor. It is completely brilliantly located for the best shopping outside of London!

<Content>Great location, value, service I have stayed here on business and would definitely return: The location is great. The suites are spacious and cost the same or less than places of similar quality that are much smaller. The service really did stand out (which is unusual these days). I was particular impressed by the speed of check in--I think it literally took 20 seconds.

<Content>Great Staff at the Cambridge Suites Hotel We booked three rooms at this hotel for the weekend of Nov. 17th 2006. All three couples were amazed at their rooms,spacious, clean,and a few extra touches. This hotel doesn't look like much from the outside but do not let this deter you. It is a real gem in downtown Toronto. The price was right but the biggest difference from other downtown hotels is the freindliness of their staff. These people can not do enough for you. I have stayed at other downtown hotels and will most definitly be coming back again to the Cambridge suites.

<Content>Great hotel in the perfect spot in Toronto Was going to book the hotel through our affiliated 'corporate' rate, but called directly and got an awesome deal on a short term special. Great start!Some mixed up person took my bag off Skycheck at the airport, so I lost my wallet, clothes, etc. I had meetings that day, but when I finally got to the hotel around 3, they let me check in without a credit card (as it was lost). They were really nice to a person with no ID, no credit card, etc.I get in my room  my bag is there, and an envelope with my replacement credit card. The concierge had it delivered up there earlier in the day. It's all about service!The rooms are huge. They really are suites. Just beautiful. A queen bed with an ensuite / change area. A sofa  chair in the sitting room / TV room. 2 TV's in the room. Room was very clean, hallways the same. And service was impeccable.The breakfast that was included was pretty good. Not bad for 'free'.The location is right where you want to be - in the heart of the City. Literally a 2 minute walk to the Eaton's Centre and all that shopping. I've stayed at a number of hotels in Toronto, and will definitely return to this one.

<Content>Clean rooms, top-notch service! We enjoyed our stay at the Cambridge very much and would stay there again. Our room was clean, and large for the price we paid, about $150/night for a suite for 4 nights.The location is prime and we walked to most of the functions we were there to attend. One night we needed a taxi to go only about 5 blocks north up Younge St., to a wedding function at the Delta Chelsea. There was only one taxi out front and he wasn't interested in taking us there, and told us to walk because he said the traffic was slow and congested, and it would be too expensive for a short ride, etc... My wife had high heels and it was cold so we started walking towards Young (which is right there on the corner) and looked for another cab. A woman on the sidewalk who watched the incident approached us and said she worked for Cambridge Suites (PR I think, and she was off work waiting for her ride), and that the taxi could not refuse us just because it was a short haul as they prefer to wait for longer fares. She walked up to him and told him, you're taking them to the Delta, and he got in his car like a scolded child and drove us up Young to the Delta in a couple minutes at high speed(there was no traffic, he lied), and the fare was under $5, and it starts at $3. I gave him a $10 to keep him happy!!I was so impressed with her intervention that I thought it was worth a mention here... that was what I call excellent service, above and beyond what I would ever expect.I don't know her name, but I thank her for the help!

<Content>Striking Gold When I was looking for a place to stay after my engagement, there were soo many option and it was driving me crazy. After comparing room size and price, Cambridge seemed the best buy. I stuck Gold!When you drive by the place, it looks like a modest hotel. We arrived late so we did not have valet service. Self parking was not too bad. We had to walk a bit, but not too much. When we got in, we thought we were in the wrong place. The exterior fools you. Inside the lobby looked wonderful. The staff was very helpful and gave us everything we needed right away. When we got inside we were blown away. The place was huge. The bed area alone was bigger than most hotels we've been to. The living room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was also very large. The bed was incredibly comfy. Room service was friendly and considerate. I had no problems at all. I loved the place and would definetly come again... I go crazy looking for the perfect hotel room, and this is the best thing I have seen so far. The only thing the lack is a hot tub ( but I hear the really fancy rooms have one). If you have the money, I would recommend this place.

<Content>Very Good, But not Great My husband and I stayed at this hotel over Labor Day weekend. Overall, the hotel was very nice. The suite was spacious, and the concierge was helpful in getting us tickets for the theater. The location was great in its proximity to much of what we wanted to do. Our only complaints really are that we had higher expectations for the attractiveness of the room and lobby and the quality of the linens.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay We stayed at this hotel at the end of August and over the long weekend. The location is terrific, in the center of DT within walking distance of the harbor, CN tower, old Toronto, shops and an abundance of restaurants. The staff was very polite, helpful and accomodating, Stuart Fleming (Concierge) took care of our needs and any requests that we had. The suites were of a decent size, it was much better than just a room with a bed, having a fridge, microwave and living area seperate from the bedroom makes a stay in the hotel that much more pleasant. We found the hotel to be a bargain compared to other locations and would recommend the Cambridge to other travelers.

<Content>Mixed bag This hotel was a disappointment in some ways, nice in others. The biggest problem I had is that it just isn't that attractive. The lobby is dimly lit, as are the hallways. I found it depressing. The room lighting was a bit better, but still not great. The towels in the bathroom were skimpy. Not thick, and pretty small. I expect more from a 4 star hotel. The continental breakfast was ok, except that the first day we arrived about 20 minutes before it ended, and they had stopped replenishing the food. The juice pitchers were empty and sitting there. There were other choices that they seemed to have run out of (I had been there earlier in the a.m. for coffee, and there was a far greater selection). There is a business center, but they charge $10 per 15 minutes, which after having stayed at 2 hotels that had free internet access, seemed ridiculous.We were erronously charged for internet use and 3 phone calls. When I pointed it out at check out, they promptly and courteously took them off. On the positive: the staff was courteous. They have a small fitness room, and also have complimentary guest passes for a local gym about a 7 minute walk away. Well worth the trouble. It was a great gym, with a separate workout area for women, and classes.The hotel fitness room had a leak and was closed when we were there. I asked for an adjustment on our rate. They declined, but then surprised us with milk and cookies in our room later that day and a nice note from the manager (not sure if they saw the irony in that, but my kids did!!). It was a nice gesture.Overall, the hotel was ok. We stayed there because it was a suite, and it was not as roomy as I had hoped, but maybe that's to be expected downtown in a big city. I probably wouldn't stay here again, as I think there probably are better choices, but I'm not sure.

<Content>Outstanding service and value This is an excellent City centre hotel, where we found comfortable, spacious and clean suites, with a continental breakfast included. The concierge, Stewart Flemming deserves a special mention as he is so helpful to visitors and its this kind of service that makes this hotel stand out. When we phoned to book, he organised a car rental for us and when we were there his restaurant recommendations and trip advice was so helpful in making our stay enjoyable. He even mailed back my wife's reading glasses which she left behind. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel and cannot understand some of the negative reviews here which have perhaps been written by the competition?

<Content>Cambridge Suites our new second home! After reading the reviews on Trip advisor, I was hesitant to book at the Cambridge Suites but I'm really glad we went. The location is fantastic as it is only a block away from the Eaton Centre, and only a few minutes walk away from a wide variety of restaurants, theatres and other shopping. The best asset of the hotel is their staff. They all are extremely friendly, knowledgeable and willing to help everyone. They made tours and dinner reservations for me and my family and directed us to the diferent attractions around Toronto. The rooms are very spacious, perfect for families and business travelers. Would we come back to the Cambridge Suites? Absolutely!

<Content>Nice hotel, could do better We stayed for five nights in late July. The suite was a good size as we were travelling with our 15 year old son, he had the sleeper sofa. The fridge and microwave were useful. The hotel is in a great location, the weather was extremely hot and we could get directly onto the PATH system and there were always taxis just outside the main entrance.On the negative side, our room wasn't made up on our second day, we returned late afternoon and had to call housekeeping to get it done. The WC was faulty, kept flushing constantly and on one occasion blocked, the maintenance man arrived quite quickly when we reported it but he only seemed to fix it temporarily. The worst problem was a faulty fire alarm system, that went off four times while we were in the hotel once at 3.30 am. The hotel wasn't evacuated but we had to be on standby whilst the alarm sounded until the fire department arrived to check it out.Overall the hotel seems to be showing its age, the staff on the desk were polite and helpful, we felt quite sorry for them as some guests were getting very angry over the fire alarm problem.

<Content>Poor Quality and service I stayed at the Cambridge suites in the beginning of July. The room was small old and unkept looking. The satff were nothing to write home about. and My room was not cleaned!!! Very unprofessional service in my opinion. The basic amenities were again nothing special, and don't be fooled like I was that its in the heart of downtown.... Its not Its west of the core and to ask for the door man to fetch me a cab was even a struggle. Won't be returning. DID NOT LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS DUMP

<Content>Great location; comfortable hotel We stayed for 4 nights at the start of July in the Cambridge with our two kids. We had a suite with pull out sofa bed and found the room to be extremely clean and comfortable and very spacious compared with a hotel room. The girl at reception who checked us in could not have been more pleasant and helpful and the bellboy/luggage porter was also extremely pleasant. Even the maid understood my husband's need to watch world cup football matches shown in the morning and offered to come back later to service the room! The buffet-style continential breakfast suited us very well. Other nice touches were the apples, decent toiletries and turndown service (with chocolates and next day's forecast). Having two televisions was also great - allowed the kids to recover cope with the time difference by watching cartoons whileWe did have a problem at the start with a faulty a/c unit - but this was repaired promptly.Finally, location couldn't have been better - quiet side street and 1 min walk to the Bay (cut through it or the PATH system below to the subway and the Eaton Centre.I'd highly recommend the Cambridge Suites, especially to families.

<Content>Forgot to clean my room Stayed here as a result of the great reviews here. They were the cheapest room in the downtown area for when I was staying there, and a suite no less.I will say that the hotel is lovely, the room is very large, and the location can't be beat. We had continental breakfast delivered to our room right on time both mornings, by two smiling faces. In fact, I enjoyed everything about the hotel, except, that they forgot to make up my room on Saturday (we were there from Fri - Sun). We got back to our room at 3:30 pm from an afternoon of shopping, and our room was not made up. I called the front desk and told them of the situation; they said that they try to make up the incoming guests rooms first, which made sense to me. I told them we would be out until about 5, and to please have the room made up.We returned at 5:10, and the room was still not made up. I called the front desk again, and the clerk expressed surprise that the room still wasn't done. I told her to forget it, as we were there now getting ready for a play; but to please have the room turned down for the evening. We came back from our play and dinner, and indeed, the room was prepared for evening.Overall, except for that, our stay was fine; great location, great price, and the room was very, very spacious. Oh, and the bathroom and vanity area were wonderful and spacious.

<Content>a great hotel I was a little nervous after reading the last few reviews but I found none of the problems that these others guests did. We were upgraded to a city view suite on the 21st floor upon arrival. The view was spectacular. 5 of us stayed in a suite with 2 double beds and a pull-out sofa. We've stayed in larger suites but this one was more than adequate. All the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly. The carpet had a few stains but no big deal. The rooms even smelled good. The complimentary breakfast was available downstairs or for delivery and was full of nice selections. We would definitely recommend this hotel.Other amenities included plush bathrobes, Aveda toiletries, turn down service with chocolates, popcorn, cookies and bottled water, thick/soft bath towels and a microwave and refrigerator in the room.A happy traveler from Massachusetts!

<Content>Toronto-Niagara trip The Hotel was centrally located  allowed easy access to mass transit-Streetcars  subway. It cost $2.50 for a one-way ride but you can get on  off one  transfer to the other to get to your destination for the one fee. On weekends a couple can obtain an unlimited pass for two for $8.00-a real bargain compared to the $2.50/person fee for one trip.The room was a suite and was very large with double sliding doors separating the bedroom from the living room. There was a refrigerator, wet bar, coffeemaker  microwave. Complimentary cookies  popcorn. The liquor/soda was very expensive. The complimentary Continental breakfast was pretty good. We would definitely go back. We were able to walk to the Harbor in about 10-15 min. Streets were exceptionally clean and extremely safe to walk at night. People were extraordinally helpful - the second I took out a map to orient myself, someone would ask if they could help. Lots of college students. We went to Chinatown  Little Italy. Chinatown was filled with stores with fruitstands on the sidewalk all with excellent bargains. Nowhere really good to eat though. LIttle Italy was nothing like NYC's version in that there were a lot less restaurants  further spread out. We ate at Capitol Trattoria  Pizzeria at 597 College St. which has a very nice sidewalk cafe. The canneloni was excellent and the veal marsala was very good.

<Content>Another pleasant experience! We just returned from our 2nd stay at Cambridge Suites Toronto. We were given a standard room which was a bit dark because it was facing another building, so we told the staff we weren't really happy with it  they graciously arranged for us to have another room with a very pleasant bright view. They couldn't have been nicer  more accomodating. I'm puzzled by the negative reviews because we've found it to be a very nice place to stay with a very convenient location. Oh .. and did I mention great Thai food just a block away at Golden Thai??!!! When we needed an extra wine glass ... or a lime sliced .. they were right there  expeditiusly handled our request. I can comfortably recommend this hotel.

<Content>Big disappointment Big Disappointment, I frequent Toronto often for business and chose the Cambridge Suites this time. It was a big disappointment to say the least. Run down rooms with a weird smell in them. The staff were the least friendly out of any hotel I've stayed at ( Believe me many !) When I callled Room service it took forever and was fast food like as well when I called reception I was left on hold for over 5 minutes. When the front desk staff finally came back on the line, I asked him why he put me on hold for long and he replied in a snarky tone Because sir, You are not the only one that we need to attend to I got off the phone and decided to solve the issue for myself as obviously helping guests is out of the question for the staff at the Cambridge Suites!! I would warn any one who is looking to stay there in the future not to....There are many other wonderful hotels in the area don't waste your time and money you will be very disappointed.

<Content>Never again! What a dissapointment. I chose to stay here after reading the reviews on trip advisor. Where the people who wrote the reviews family members to the hotel because nothing of what was raved about was at all seen during my stay! From the outside it looks like a classy elegant hotel. However not that way in the inside. The staff were ICE COLD and had no professional etiqutte what so ever. The rooms are old and very warn down (whoever said beautiful must be blind!) This is a low budget hotel with a nice outside face.Don't be tricked by this...... Trust me....You can do much better for that rate. And thank you once again to the Lovely staff who take so much pride in the hotel and customer service (YEAH RIGHT) it put a damper on my entire visit in T.O.... NEVER AGAIN CAMBRIDGE SUITeS

<Content>Loved every second of our stay We spent a weekend in Toronto as a getaway and loved every second of our stay at the Cambridge Suite Hotel. The price was extremely reasonable, considering the location (downtown Toronto, close to ALL amenities and subway), the safety of the hotel and the size of the suite. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful. The suite was clean and the mini-bar well-stocked when we arrived. Some could complain about the view (we looked directly into the windows of an office building) but to be honest, our trip was about the CITY, not the room. I would recommend this to any visitor in a heartbeat.

<Content>may not be worth the $200 My boyfriend and I were going to Toronto too see The Lord of the Rings for our 1 year anniversary. We shopped around and decided on Cambridge suites. The selling point for my boyfriend was the robes provided in the room. so we booked our reservation by phone late February early March. We then called in the beginning of may to confirm our reservation and they had lost it! The confirmation number that we were given was an old one we were told! So they almost lost us there. But after looking around a bit more we figured it looked best and wasnt too far from the theater. So we called again and rebooked. When we went to check in we then found out that there was a $300 deposit on the room! (that would have been fine if they had told us a head of time, we like to budget things out) so we didnt have enough on the Credit card for it. So we ended up doing a little juggling with our debit card and the credit card. like I said that wouldnt have been a problem as long as they told us it was that much. I find that to be an outrageous amont for a deposit. Anyway we made use of the hottub and we had a nice night at the show and the bed was very comfortable. I also liked how large the bathroom was. oh yea! they had an evening turn down service that we didnt know about. So we came back to our room and things were replenished and our bed was made ready to sleep in with chocolates and a weather report. Didnt really need the service, nice touch, but once again a little warning so we werent confused on why things were moved around would have been nice. All round it was an ok experiance. Would I stay there again? Not sure. Havent stayen in Toronto a lot, probably check out a few more places. But if you stay there make sure you call to confirm!

<Content>Caribana Cool I stayed at the Cambridge Suites last year during Caribana and found the hotel to be very nice. It was clean and safe. After-hours, during the Caribana season, they check key cards to ensure that people who don't stay in the hotel aren't roaming the hotel. It was a little annoying, but it is an attempt to increase the safety so you really can't complain too much. It was a short walk away from food, shopping, and transportation. I would recommend this to anyone. I stayed with 4 girlfriends and we had a great time, although the beds were a little small compared to the ones in American hotels. Loved the in-room safe and the snacks that came with the deluxe room. I found the staff to be professional yet distant, not overly friendly, but they gave great direction when prompted. Also, when the aunt of my friend came by to drop off homemade food, and we weren't in, the staff took the food and kept it warm for us until we arrived. All in all, it is a good experience for the price.

<Content>Horrible Service-annoying front desk lady I decided for my boyfriend and I's 2 year anniversary I would rent a hotel I booked it and was told I was getting a specific room and that I could check in early. When I went the next day to check in the lady at the front desk was so rude. She spoke to me like a child since I look young and wasn't actaully listening to what I was saying. She just repeated unfortunally a dozen times given me a bunch of different excuses of to why I cant check in. She made me feel like garbage and I felt like she was a robot with no soul. I came later and was given a room that was different to the one I was promised. The room was nice although the TV's were outdated and fuzzy. I liked the hotel but the service was horrible I wish they wouldnt lie. It was not worth 200 for one night

<Content>Cambridge was above and beyond the good reviews Once again, Trip Advisor users were dead on with a hotel recommendation. My girlfriend and I stayed at the Cambridge Suites this weekend and absolutely loved it. The rooms were as advertised - large king bed and a pull out in a seperate living area. The room was clean and relatively spacious for the price. The location is excellent - especially for shopping in the Eaton Centre area. Chinatown, Little Italy and the CN Tower/financial district are all a little more of a walk, but we never even ended up using the subway or cabs considering the wonderful weather we had.Most importantly, the service at Cambridge Suites was OUTSTANDING. Not only was the staff helpful, cheerful and polite, but they went above and beyond the call of duty by sending a fruit and light dessert plate to our room upon hearing that we were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday. It's the sort of extra small touch that goes a long way.Every member of the lobby staff was knowledgable about the area, right down to which highways were under construction. Nice additional touches included crackers, popcorn and daily bottles of water left by the cleaning staff, as well as cards informing you of the next day's weather forecast after they turned down the bed. Again, the sort of small touches that go a long way.Kudos to Trip Advisor for again recommending a gem - I plan to stay here on any of my future trips to Toronto!

<Content>Great night's sleep! We spent 3 nights at the Cambridge Suites and loved it. Very roomy suite for family of four. Loved the King size bed and the kids were comfy on the pull out. Service was excellent and the continental breakfast offered enough of a selection to please all of us. Located nicely in the city to promote walking to all attractions but also convenient to the PATH and subway. Would absolutely stay here again.

<Content>Just what we needed We had just spent a family vacation skiing in Lake Louise and were flying back through Toronto. Rather than have a 4 hour layover at the airport on a Friday evening we decided to stay the night in Toronto and catch a flight the next day. We found the Cambridge Suites to be just what we needed. The room was very nice with two very comfortable double beds. The bathroom has very large with a separate vanity area outside of the actual bathroom. There were also two entrances to the bathroom, one from the living room and other from the bedroom. Everything was very clean. There was lots of natural light in both the bedroom and the living room because both were on outside walls with wall-to-wall windows. We were on a high floor but faced the courtyard into what appeared to be an office building. The living room area was very large with a wet bar area and a work area with a separate desk. Two TVs meant that the each kid could watch what they wanted.The staff was very nice and knowledgable. When I called looking for pillows and blankets for the pull out bed the operator quickly pointed out that the pillows were in the bottom drawer of the bathroom vanity (I looked in the closets). The blanket was already made up in the pull out but another arrived within ten minutes of my call. We also liked the layout of the hotel. I was initially concerned that our room was near the elevators and we would hear the bell everytime a guest got off on on the floor. The hotel; however, only has about a dozen guest suites per floor. As a result, there is not a lot of traffic on the floor. While we heard a few other guests enter or leave the elevator, we never heard anything once guests were in their suites. We did not use the dining facilties in the hotel but instead had a good dinner at an Italian place across the street and around the corner. The restaurant in the hotel was a little formal and expensive for a family with small children. If I return to Toronto I would not hesitate to stay at the Cambridge Suites again.

<Content>Great Stay - Baby Friendly We stayed at the Cambridge Suites Hotel in February for a long weekend break and loved it. This was our first hotel stay with our 3 month old and were a little apprehensive. We need not have worried! The staff were excellent and managed to check us in and get all of our belongings to the suite very quickly. The suite itself was great - plenty of room for the baby's crib plus our luggage. The kitchenette was functional with a microwave and small fridge/freezer. It was very convienent to have 2 televisions - one in the lounge area and one in the bedroom. The whole suite was very clean with plenty of towels and 2 bathrobes. It was very useful to have the large dressing area that adjoined the bathroom and bedroom. The breakfast buffet was well stocked - it was nice to be able to take breakast back to the suite. The turndown service with chocolate and bottled water was a nice touch!We certainly will be using this hotel again on future trips to Toronto.

<Content>Room for Primping The room was not as spacious as I would have hoped for, however, for 2 Moms and 2 teenage girls we had lots of mirrors and space for getting ready. Surprisingly, the pull-out was quite comfortable, but the blankets were very thin and in very bad shape. The hotel was conveniently located. The continental breakfast was just your typical continental breakfast, but it was nice to be able to have it delivered to the room. The hot tub was great and has a wonderful view of the city.

<Content>Not bad, but definately not 4* I always make sure i spend a couple of hours checking out reviews before i book anywhere...the Cambridge Suites being no exception!Reviews here and Expedia all overly praise the CS in my opinion,Its a nice place, superb location but the accommodation and service is just average....nothing like 4*.I travel to various places about a dozen times a year and would rate this as a reasonable 3*...no frills or anything out of the ordinary TBH.The service was adequate if not a bit clueless if you asked a question past  how much is my bill .Not sure if its the Canadian way but you'd wait 10 minutes to get served at the empty bar which i thought was rather odd!!Breakfast is a miss, the room service isnéˆ¥æª› worth the ordering as its scant and not really edible...not sure what its like downstairs as we usually got up and out early so just ate on the run...Location is as good as it gets though...at the bottom of Yonge, walking distance to anywhere really!Its cheap so you cant complain but donéˆ¥æª› go expecting the earth!

<Content>The Cambridge Suites - Definately Sweet! It would be pretty hard to find any faults with this hotel, it was amazing! I'm 25 and decided to take my girlfriend to toronto to show her where I came from. she loved it and I have to say that the hotel helped make the holiday even sweeter! We went in mid May '05, it was pretty sunny which was a bonus and the hotel staff left little weather cards with our breakfast each day, letting us know what weather was in store for us. Our room was really spacious and looked out onto some beautiful sky scrapers (something you just don't see in Liverpool!). We had a mid sized living room with a couch and a cofortable chair, a nice breakfast table and a large TV. across the room was a very expensive looking desk wich we used, not for the intended purpose though! A little kitchenette with a microwave, sink, firdge, minibar and cutlery aswel, We only went for 5 days so we ate out every night. Our bedroom, which was joined both to the living room by sliding doors and a dressing room by a normal door was quite basic but pretty big, our bed was so, so big and comfortable though, so that made up for anything the room was lacking in character. The dressing room was joined to the kitchen end of the living room but was quite small, but hey, at least there's a dressing room! The bathroom was a nice size and it was nice to have the dressing room for my girlfriend to do her hair and make-up while I got showered. The hotel had a gym on the 22nd (top) floor, which had a jacuzzi and various cardio machines and fixed weights, the views from the gym, and especially the jacuzzi where great. All in all the hotel was great, we loved it and at the price I got it for I'd have been mad to have gone anywhere else, when we go back to Toronto we're definately going to stay in the Cambridge Suites Hotel, we both absolutely loved it.

<Content>Location,Location!!!! What a great spot for a restful get-away!We've just returned from a midweek escape to Toronto and the first time to the Cambridge Suites. The location is perfect for shopping,the theatre and sporting events. We often are in T.O. and cab everywhere....but this time we walked Everywhere (partially thanks to this unusually fanatastic mild winter we're having!!)There is plenty of room in the suite which we really would have appreciated when our kids were little but truly enjoyed on our own...the kids are away at university. Very pleasant stay!

<Content>Fabulous place to stay - very reasonable What a fabulous hotel! I loved it, there is not one thing that I can even think of to try and complain about. Many friends were staying in hotels in the area close to Massey Hall. This one by far had the best room size, and the staff was wonderful. Mints and a turndown every night, breakfast in the morning. Best hotel I have stayed in.

<Content>Great service, great suites! My family and I stayed here during a recent trip to Toronto which was meant to see the Nutcracker at the Ballet and do some Christmas shopping.While my two children were disapointed at first that the hotel did not have a pool, we were told that the jacuzzi on the top floor is ten person one, with great views of the city. My children were immediately excited at the opportunity of being on the top floor and in a hot tub that was raised to the level of the windows as the desk clerk put it. He was right, the view at night was spectacular, even the sauna had a window in it!My children quickly forgot the pool disapointment when we got to the suite and they learned they had a room all to themselves. My husband and I would stay in the bedroom, and my children on the pull-out sofa in the livingroom. Well what an adventure it was for them! They had their on TV to watch movies, while we could watch something seperate in the bedroom.The staff recommended Ontario Place, a small amusement park for the kids with a Winter theme for the holidays as well as the Ontario Science Center, both of which were great!The hotel is close to major shopping areas and attractions, and the price can't be beat! We shopped around and found comparable prices at regular hotels, and here you get free breakfast and a suite.Can't fault the service, the facilties, the price or the location... maybe they could build a pool though.

<Content>A must visit in Toronto I have stayed in many hotels in toronto on business visits and this is my favourite, I always go stay here or at the marriott eaton centre when i visist.the hotel is located close to the financial district to walks to work are short, and they offer a free breakfast in the mornings delivered to your room free begining at 6:30, really convenient if you need to be at the office early.the staff are always friendly and the ladies at the front desk do a great job of remembering my name when i visit (I go fairly regularly). everyone is pleasant. the bar is also good for drinks with colleagues in the evening. Big workspace for your laptop, fax service at the front desk is always prompt, and the desk lighting is good. the only fault I can find is that internet is a charge (albeit small). Would recommend this place to business travelers and ones visiting as tourists, let the staff spoilt you.

<Content>Nothing Special I have just returned from a 6-night stay at the Cambrdige Suites Hotel with my boyfriend. And after reading some excellent reviews about it we were really looking forward to our stay. However I was disappointed to find it didn't live up to our modest expectations.On our arrival staff were friendly and check in went without a hitch.The room was very big and comfortable with a massive king sized bed as promised but I was loathed to find the shower doors coated in mould which made the whole bathing situation somewhat off-putting. Luckily there was a good sized bath aswell. There were two TVs - one in the bedroom and one on the lounge - both of which changed colour to red and green whilst we were watching.Not very good after we'd paid $13 for an in-house movie! We never found out what it was but our room was also very noisy. We put up with loud bangs in the early hours of the morning as though we were next to some large metal factory - which we weren't.I discovered the free popcorn which is promised - hidden in a smmall basket hidden behind the tea bags and one packet of free cookies. It was DIY style pop in the bag which you had to put in the microwave. Beware of the smell it makes. When I did it it absolutely stank the room out for hours.Breakfast was OK but the first two mornings we went it was very busy and with limited seating we were told we could take breakfast back to our room on a tray. Not what we had in mind and luckily some seats became available. On the next to last morning we decided to have a bit of a lie-in and didn't go to breakfast until about 8.45ish (finishes at 9am). Food was in very short supply - no milk left, only two bits of bread and 1 bagel in the basket. Despite there being numerous staff on duty who made regular checks they never topped up any of the supplies. Didn't give off a good impression. This said, there was normally ample food to choose from - cereals, fruit, yoghurts, muffins, bagels and toast and doughnuts.Good location and close to major shops and restaurants. All in all a very average hotel. Definitely not what it lives up to on its own website and certainly not 5*. Would definitely visit Toronto again but not in this hotel.

<Content>Superb hotel I have just returned from a great four night stay at the Cambridge Suites Hotel. It really is an excellent hotel in every way. The suites are so comfortable and I think the hotel has thought of everything. My 3 friends and I did not want to leave. If you want a smart, comfortable hotel with wonderful friendly staff then stay here.When visiting Toronto I would highly recommend the set lunch at the CN Tower. You need to book but the experience is fantastic especially if you are lucky enough to get a clear day. We also booked a tour to Niagara Falls with Toronto Tours. It was one of the most expensive but it was worth every penny. Our guide was brilliant and we had a full day, culminating in a final view of the Falls by night (totally unexpected but what a bonus!)Toronto is a great place, lovely people and wonderful shops. I would love to go back.

<Content>Good I stayed at the Cambridge Suites Hotel for a week in the middle of November. This was my second stay, after a two week stay this past August. The rooms are a good size, except there isn't much room to walk around where the bedroom is. There's a decent-sized sitting area, bedroom. The bathroom is a little bit of a squeeze with a shower on one side and a bathtub in the other. The housekeeping staff has been very polite and courteous on both occasions. The carepts however are a bit dirty. I wouldn't recommend walking around in your bare feet. However, I do recommend bringing slipers, since the hotel doesn't provide any. There is a small fitness center on the top floor. There are three treadmills, two stairmasters, a small hot tub, and sauna. There's a nice view of the city skyline from the fitness center. I only recommend it for business travelers, or couples looking to experience the city. The hotel is located practically in the center of the downtown area, with restaurants and shops galore. I had stayed in this hotel for business travel.

<Content>Spacious and comfortable room, great location Stayed for 2 nights in Oct. Fast check-in, with 3 people on staff. What a treat to enter my room and find a real suite. Good layout, too, w/ the bed in the back, buffering any sound from the hallways.A glorious bed with 4 down pillows. En suite bathroom, w/ a long marble counter and changing space, leading to the bathroom. Some of the doors open awkwardly, like the bathroom door that banged into the toilet and the closet door that banged into another open one. Not a big deal but you had to always close 1 door before opening another.In the living area, a wet bar with marble countertop, sink, coffeemaker and mini-fridge. Although I could not find the promised free popcorn. Hmmmm...Complimentary breakfast can be ordered in. Wonderful not to change and fix my hair just to go down to breakfast. However, on both days they messed up my order, forgetting juice altogether and mixing up the muffin choices.Furniture is a slightly worn, but serviceable. Two excellent work areas, a large desk in the living room facing the TV, and another desk in the bedroom, next to the bed.Caveat about lounging in your skivvies: the staff are very eager to enter your room for various reasons (turn-down service, wash your coverlet). The 1st night, I'd just checked-in and was eating supper (not good) in bed at 8pm. The door flew open, the maid bustled in wanting to turn down my bed. Luckily, I was still half decently dressed. The next morning, at 8am, again the door opened without a knock and in marched another maid wanting to divest my bed of the coverlet to launder it. Uh, okay, but I was still using it... After the 2nd incident, I made sure to hang the Do Not Disturb sign every time I stepped in my room.Location is good, being only a block away from Yonge.Restaurant tip: Only a few blocks away, you will find an excellent Thai restaurant called Young Thailand. If you can overlook the bad service, you will love the great food.

<Content>Great Stay! Wow - blown away. Stayed on business for just one night, but will definetly return. My room had a seperate living area (hence the name Suites, I guess) - but surprisingly it was FULL SIZED! A big couch, desk and kitchen area were seperate from the bedroom and impressive bathroom. There are other places claiming to be suites, but I would argue against that after staying here!In addition, the restaurant was GREAT and the fitness room overlooks the city on the top floor. The staff were very responsive and courteous.If I could grow another hand to give another thumbs up, I would. For now we'll have to settle with the best hotel in the city for value/product that I can think of.!!!!!!!

<Content>Great Location! Stayed here in October for 3 days in a regular suite. The size compared to a regular hotel room was apprciated with a large lounge area, hallway and a big bathroom. Not much of a view of Yonge street (we were on the 5th floor) but a reasonable view. I was worried about the breakfast expecting it to be quite busy but found a table next to the window easily and a good selection. Only disaapointing thing about the breakfast was that it only opened from 7am to 9am.All in all a great hotel, great price, excellent location, great cleanliness, nice complimentaries (popcorn, cookies, tea, coffee, water etc in the room). All staff were friendly and we would definatly stay again. Would like a safe in the room next time and I understand the upgraded rooms have these (along with complemantary internet access).

<Content>First Class Hotel. We stayed at the Cambridge suites for a few nights, and found it to be a very enjoyable experience from start to finish. Very professional staff who were very helpful at all times, and they could not have done more to make our stay a success.The hotel itself was very clean and tidy, with a very good resturant, and it is situated in a very central position for seeing the important parts of this super city.Would recommend this hotel without hestitation to our friends.

<Content>Wonderful Weekend! We stayed at Cambridge Suites, October 14-17, 2005. We had a wonderful time. The hotel was the best we have ever stayed in Toronto! Very clean rooms with plenty of space for 4 people. We were on the 15 floor and had a great view. We chose to have our breakfast delivered to our room each morning and was quite surprised with the prompt service and the extra added touches (the tray was delivered with a rose and the morning paper). At times it was hard to get our two children out of the room. They loved having the extra space, their own television, popcorn every night and breakfast in bed. They loved the pillows! Staff was very friendly and attentive. They did an excellent job meeting all of our needs. We would definitely stay at Cambridge Suites again in the future.

<Content>Comes with our highest recommendation My wife and I recently stayed at the Cambridge Suites celebrating our honeymoon and we couldn't have been happier. The rooms were huge in comparison with standard hotel rooms, but the pricepoint was the same! I had ordered champagne and chocolate covered strawberries from the Concierge ahead of my arrival and I was not disapointed. The card, and items were waiting for us upon our arrival, even though we came in past midnight. THE ICE HADN'T EVEN MELTED! So someone must have either gone up recently, or changed the ice thinking it may have gone to water! I was impressed.Its a great location in downtown Toronto. close to all major attractions, connected to the subway station and in a very safe neighbourhood. The free breakfast is nice, and you can get it delivered to your room free too which was great.We tried the pay breakfast in the restaurant one morning and it was very good too.All in all, service was great, the suites were clean and spacious, and we would definately recommend. The wait for the elevators was sometimes long, and the suites are a little on the dark side as it relates to lighting... but we still enjoyed our suite to the fullest! Would definately return

<Content>The suites were sweet! Stayed here recently with my partner and loved it very much! Suites were of a good size, breakfast was included, amazing location right downtown. The hotel felt very posh and it was such a comfortable refuge from our busy touring!Service was excellent, cleanliness was second to none, definately somewhere I would stay again and recommend to others!

<Content>Thanksgiving weekend We have just spent a long weekend in Toronto and stayed for 3 nights at the Cambridge..We booked the Thanksgiving Weekend Special..excellent value. The hotel is in an ideal location and convenient for all shops and for sightseeing..Underground parking convenient and the hotel is easy to get to from the Gardner Expressway. Suite was clean and well furnished to a high standard..all in all a comfortable place to stay when in Toronto...Breakfast a bit chaotic, but who cares its FREE...bowls of apples in the lobby and hallways, coffee,tea,biscuits and popcorn in the room with fresh milk and cream in the fridge... Staff were helpful and friendly.The jacuzzi on the top floor is worth a visit. We had a great trip to Toronto visiting family and friends and the Cambridge was a good place to come home to each night. Would certainly recommend.

<Content>Lives up to its reviews My wife and I stayed there for 7 nights from the 19th to the 26th August to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The hotel lived up to the reviews, great staff, good location and spacious comfortable rooms. The hotel could not have been better place for central Toronto and the staff did everything they could to make our stay memorable including suggesting a wonderful place to have dinner on our anniversary (Reds on Adelaide). The rooms were well maintained spacious and came with nice extra touches. Next time we are in Toronto I know where we will be staying.

<Content>Great stay We stayed at the Cambridge Suites from Sept 29-Oct 3 and thought it was wonderful. None of us understood the bad reviews. The standard suite was much larger than a normal hotel room and was probably cheaper than most. The free breakfast was very good and is comparable, if not better than what you get at most conferences. The free bottled water was an extra plus. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Great location near the subway and PATH. Restaurant was rather pricey, but cheaper places close by. Will definitely stay here again.

<Content>A Great Find - would definitely return! This hotel was a real surprise and a great find - it was no. 1 on Trip Advisor when we booked it and deserved to be so as it was everything a city hotel should be. The reception was neat and the staff friendly and helpful. the room was very clean, extremely well stocked and much larger than the average for a very, very reasonable price - we loved the lounge area and the extra t.v.'s! Breakfast is a bit chaotic as it seems to be a free-for-all, but we would definitely return and this was a great base for seeing all the sights of toronto. Staff also pre-booked our tour to Niagara which was hassle free.

<Content>Good hotel for the price The Cambridge Suites hotel was a very reasonably priced hotel and the accommodations were very nice. Having a separate sink outside the bathroom is a helpful touch so that one person can be showering while the other has access to a sink/mirror. The suite itelf was good size, comfortable, furnishings above average and in good condition. The location was in walking distance to a number of places including the St. Lawrence Market.

<Content>Location, Location, Location! Myself and my travel companions kindly got picked up at Toronto Airport in a stretched limo 'hummer' (this nice surprise was supplied by a family member over there).Whilst three of us got out at the Radisson, myself and my girlfriend had booked a room for the same price at the Cambridge Suites. The room was spacious and airy with a decent view of downtown TO. There were seperate rooms for the living room, bedroom, and bathroom which made the room feel like a mini-apartment. There were two tv's and a huge sink / mirrored area specially designed for girls (Well, I sure didn't need all that sink / mirror space!).The minibar was expensive (as with any hotel), and the continental breakfast they brought to the room was less than filling (I had to eat as soon as we left the hotel).All in all it was an excellent stay and our room was definately worth the money. A big window providing views was also appreciated. The best thing about the hotel is the location, however. Right on the corner of Richmond and Yonge, it is ideal for everything (shopping, eating, entertainment etc). The CN Tower was a fair walk as is the waterfront, but if you like life in the city then this area is for you.It is a bit pricey but for downtown Toronto, its not too bad.I would stay here again.

<Content>Cambridge Suites Our family spent an enjoyable two nights in the Cambridge Suites in August 2005. We had stayed at a number of historic Fairmont Hotels in other cities on this vacation and enjoyed the change of pace in this very modern hotel. The room was well equipped and had a separate sink from the toilet/shower room. The location is convenient, a short walk from the Path which provides indoor access to virtually everywhere downtown. The teenagers enjoyed the proximity to Eaton Mall. We had an exceptional (if rather expensive for children) meal in the hotel restaurant and daily continental breakfast was included. The service level did not match the service provided at our other hotels but this was a three star rather than a four or five star hotel and it was priced accordingly. Our only complaint was the long wait for elevators (it apeared that only one of three was operational) and our floor was too high to climb the stairs.

<Content>Really liked this hotel. Good location First trip to Canada and very impressed.Stayed in deluxe suite and room was exactly as descibed. As we had teenager with us the room suited perfectly. Room very clean and abundance of fresh towels. Never saw the room servicing staff as we were out of hotel most of day. Check in nad out was very fast. Staff were very helpful and informative. Really good location as advised by other contributers to Trip Advisor.Could walk to everything we wanted to go to. A bit quiet at night.We went on bus tour recommended by hotel which was probaly a rip off.Good gym. Nice bar to retire to at end of busy day. I liked breakfast in hotel but my hungarycompanions wanted more and went to Sunset grill on next block and thoroughly enjoyed their breakfast.Would definitely stay here again. Good if you have younger family with you.

<Content>Great Stay Just spent 2 nights at the Cambridge Suites Hotel. I was completely satisfied with accommodations. The hotel is located in a great location. Your in walking distance to just about everything! Although I did not encounter the staff frequently, the little interaction I had was positive. Check in and out was seamless. Maid service was adequate. The room was very clean and spacious. Our king suite looked a bit more updated than the pictures posted here. We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Genuinelty surprised by all the negative feedback.... I have to say that having stayed at the Cambridge Suites in July '05, I am very surprised at all the bad press it seems to be getting! (oh, and I can assure everyone that I don't work for the Hotel, am not it's owner and have absolutely NO reason to lie!).We stayed at this hotel as our 1st stop of our Honeymoon. We arrived at 2am and the receptionist was very attentive, knew who we were immediately and was very helpful. We were shown to our room which was of a good size and very clean. I have to admit I didnt check the carpets in detail however I would have thought that after 3 night stay I would have probably notived had they been that dirty!We're not the most demanding of guests so I can't really speak for the levels of service when something is requested however we did ask for a wake up call which was on time and at all times the hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful.I would have no hesitation in recommending the Cambridge Suites however I can only speak for the room we stayed in which again, was more than satisfactory.

<Content>Just right Stayed at the Cambridge Suites for two days on our way out West and for another night on the way back to the UK. It was just like home and the suite felt less like a hotel than many places I've stayed. It was really nice being able to completeley shut off the bedroom area. Also the breakfast (which we'd expected to be just a few rolls and coffee) was excellent. and the location...well that couldn't be better. Would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Disappointing My family  I stayed at Cambridge Suites for 2 nights in August, 2005 based upon the stellar Tripadvisor reviews. The suites are a comfortable size and configuration for a family but the staff and service were very poor. Upon a 4PM arrival - used breakfast dishes cluttered the hallway on 2 floors. The dishes were still there at 6:30PM when we left for dinner. The room was not made up until nearly 5PM. Unlike our other hotels in Canada, the Front desk staff did not advise about or process a refund of the Guest Services Tax. Housekeepers were surly when called to make up room. Carpets are dingy and appeared dirty. Like another recent reviewer, I am suspicious that Cambridge staff and friends are submitting misleading reviews of this hotel to boost the Tripadvisor ratings.

<Content>disappointing hotel i was on a business trip to toronto arriving at midnight leaving at 4:00, so time was crucial...i needed a place close by to my business appointment...i called the hotel to confirm the location was good for me, i also requested non-scented cleaning products to be used in the room,a room located far away from the elevators and i needed two double beds. i read the negative reviews others had written about the hotel, became concerned and called the hotel to review my reservation and requests...i was assured all my requests would be met, and that the hotel was a short walking distance to my destination. i arrived at the hotel at midnight, was given a room with only one double bed....after i called down to the front desk, they agreed to change rooms, but the other rooms had been cleaned with scented cleaning products, so i stayed.... the room was clean, and the bed linens are the best! i requested a wake-up call, and room service of coffee and tea to coordinate with the wake-up call....this was delightfully carried out by friendly staff. the short walk,which they actually gave me directions to.... ended up being a 15 minute cab ride (after i had walked about 15 minutes)...and i was late for my appointment. when the front desk asked me about my stay, i related my disappointments, in terms of service, it was disappointing, and my tardiness to my appointment reflected poorly on me.

<Content>Just what we wanted For the price, this hotel far exceeded our expectations. The room was spacious and well-appointed. The temperature adjustments worked fine and, after we requested mroe towels and toiletries, we had everything we needed. The concierge was very helpful. The bartender was very accomodating. The gym left a little to be desired, mostly in the locker room, but not big deal. I would definitely stay here again, especially since we got a suite for less than the cost of most hotel rooms.

<Content>not what they say they are I usally try select my hotel by the rating on trip advisor. Someone within the Cambridge Suitesmust be sitting there and just giving all these positive reviews. The hotel is old and outdated, dirty carpets in the rooms, and to top it all I shared the room with a guest yes a ROACH.when i complained i did not get a response but we we look in to it and thats the last I heared.Do not belive the the faulse reviews with the excellent rating, none come close to reality

<Content>Great Hotel! We loved our stay at the Cambridge Suites. I have to admit to being a little disappointed when we first saw the suite. The decor reminded me of a Hampton Inn or something of that level, not a nice hotel in downtown Toronto. That soon faded away, however, as I discovered what an excellent location it has and all of the nice extras. The mini-bar area was nicely equipped with glasses, corkscrew, etc. The refrigerator was a nice touch, particularly the real milk for coffee. The room was spacious and well-laid-out and the bed was really comfortable. The turndown service was very nice, particularly the bottled water that they left. The best feature, though, is the 2pm check-out time. It was great to be able to have access to the room until it was time to head to the airport. The complimentary breakfast was good, but the breakfast room got extremely crowded. Overall, this hotel is an excellent home base for exploring Toronto and boasts lots of nice extra touches. We'll definitely stay there again when visiting Toronto!

<Content>just ok Our family stayed at the Cambridge Suites hotel in early August. The room was quite small for 4 people, and was nothing special. It overlooked ugly buildings with graffiti on them The location is right in downtown, and not the prettiest section of Toronto. The concierge however was very helpful and the front desk was very friendly.

<Content>What a great hotel! My family stayed there 4 nights late July while attending convention nearby, and we all loved it. I saw this negative review, and wanted to make sure other potential guests realized that his experience was an the exception, as you can see from all the other rave reviews. What we loved: staff (front desk, concierges -- must have gotten tired of us! housekeeping, those nice ladies delivering breakfast exactly on time in the mornings); the free breakfasts, the size/configuration of the room, plenty of space for up to 2/2, the location, the quiet, really, everything. Even used the workout room/jacuzzi -- but you can get a day pass for the Adelaide Club 2 blocks away, which is much bigger, at no charge.A lot of hotels are charging for high speed now, so I don't think you can fault them for that, unless you are being hyper critical, or want to pay more for the room.My cost of $209 C was reasonable, especially considering Toronto prices.Tip: go see Blue Man Group, playing up Younge (subway next door). And the trolley on King or Queen St. will take you west to some wonderful restaurants - try Taro Grill or Brassaii, but many more. And we loved the RichTree 3 blocks towards water-giant food court, freshly made - the trout was wonderful, and the desserts sublime. I even forgot my digital camera charger (plugged into wall) and they had found it and mailed it back immediately at their expense, and couldn't have been nicer about it. I assumed I'd never see it again. It's that kind of place.People staying at the Sheraton and Hilton (convention hotels) were jealous when they realized they could have stayed at CS for same rate.We also stayed at CS in Halifax and loved it, so this chain (of only 3, wish they'd come to US) is exceptional.

<Content>Exceeded expectations My family of 4 just returned from a two day stay at the Cambridge Suites Hotel, which we booked based on reviews from Tripadvisor.com. I can't say enough great things about this hotel! We arrived from the Niagara Falls area at mid-morning, and although the room was understandably not ready, we were able to complete paperwork so after sightseeing, all we needed to do was pick up the key. The staff was very cordial and helpful with advice on things to do and see, as well as making arrangements for a city tour for us. When we returned from a full day of sightseeing, the suite was very clean, comfortable, and well-apppointed (I especially appreciated the Neutrogena bath products, and the kids loved the basket of snacks). The on-site laundry room (consisting of 2 washers and 2 dryers) was clean, well-lit, and fairly priced. The breakfast was typical continental (we've stayed in lower priced chain hotels that provide waffle irons, etc), but there was a good assortment and everything was fresh. Access to transportation could not have been more convenient, and we were in walking distance to many restaurants and shops, and yes, a Starbucks on practically every corner! We will most definitely recommend the Cambridge Suites Hotel to friends visiting the Toronto area.

<Content>Great hotel in Downtown Toronto We just left Toronto after a two day stay at the Cambridge Suites Hotel. It was a great hotel in a safe area, close to Eaton Centre and the subway. We walked to many attractions, hopped the subway for others. Rooms were great for our family of four with adult daughter and son. The beds were great to sleep on. Real thermostats on wall (switchable between Farenheit and Celsius!) to control the termperature. Only downside was the silly $10 a day charge for high speed Internet.

<Content>It Is Number One For A Reason! The Cambridge Suites is consistently rated number one by TripAdvisor members, and now I know why. We stayed three nights, and enjoyed our stay thoroughly. We stayed on the 20th floor, and our suite was very private and quiet as other reviews have stated. Having a sleeping area that completely closed off from the living area with double doors was a plus, as I am an early riser and my husband is not.The suite had all the amenities one could want, from complimentary coffee/tea/popcorn  cookies, to a fully stocked and clearly priced mini-bar, to dishes, silverware, and cloth napkins, to terry robes, and Neutrogena products for the bathroom. Coffeemaker, refrierator, microwave, ironing board  iron, hair dryer, cd player, video game console, all were included along with two televisions.Continental breakfast is included in the price of the room. They offer an assortment of cereals with well chilled milk, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, fruit juices, breads for toasting, muffins, bagels, fresh fruits, dried fruits, and assorted pastries and yogurts. Guests can choose to have breakfast delivered to their room, or to eat in the Club Room on the second floor.And the location! We were able to walk just about anywhere we wanted to go; we were literally steps from the PATH and Eaton Centre. There was a record-breaking heat wave while we were in Toronto, so the fact that a taxi was always available at the Cambridge entrance was very convenient for those times when we did not want to walk and brave the heat. By the way, the air conditioning in the room handled the heat wave very well; we were quite comfortable, even during the hottest part of the day.The staff was very pleasant and attentive. We were there to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary, and were wished a happy one upon check-in. Later, a complimentary fruit  cheese tray and bottle of wine were sent to our room, along with an anniversary card. Nice touch.There were no surprise charges at check-out; everything was as expected. I recommend The Cambridge Suites highly, and will certainly stay there again on my next visit to Toronto.

<Content>Great experience Just returned from my trip to Toronto/Niagara Falls. I stayed at the Cambridge Suites for the Toronto portion and attended a conference during that time. The overall experience was great and I really enjoyed the hotel.The rooms are nice, not overly spacious, but have good amenities such as a refrigerator, microwave, and dishes. The staff was very nice, courteous, and helpful. Jennifer, the concierge, is extremely helpful and goes above and beyond to help you. They provide a continental breakfast in the morning that you can either eat in the breakfast room or have delivered to your suite -- we did both.The rooms were very quiet and there was no street noise, even though you are very close to the street (we were on the 4th floor). The location is ideal in the downtown area and allows you to walk to Eaton Centre and some of the other places in downtown. We walked to Richtree Market in the BCE Place, Mr. Greenjeans in Eaton Centre, and Sunset Grill for breakfast.One tip: there is a Manager's reception on Wednesday evenings from 5:00 to 7:00. They provide appetizers and beer and wine. Its a pretty decent selection and they serve wines from Peller Estates in Niagara on the Lake. It was a nice experience and we were lucky to be there on that day.The Cambridge Suites is a nice oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city of Toronto. All in all, I think it was one of the best hotel experiences I have had and I would highly recommend it.

<Content>an oasis in Toronto We stayed 5 nights while attending a conference. The suite was a little less spacious than I had expected, but it was still very comfortable. We very much enjoyed the continental breakfasts (with big pots of hot water and coffee) delivered free to the room, with real silverware and cloth napkins - such a civilized service. And it's nice to have a microwave, sink, and fridge. The bathroom/dressing area was quite large, and the bed comfortable. Our room was clean and housekeeping was very responsive and thorough. The hotel was a bit farther away from the convention center than I had thought (my own fault) but otherwise it's very nicely situated. All in all, I prefer a good smaller hotel over the large chain hotels. If you seek a quieter, more intimate hotel experience with great amenities, Cambridge Suites is for you.

<Content>Cambridge, not suite enough Maybe it is just by comparison, but I didn't find the Cambridge Suites exceptional at all. The desk staff was efficient and pleasant not necessarily friendly or helpful. I would describe the room about the same, efficient and pleasant. I found it very odd that they have so many different people coming into your room at all hours of the day and evening. One makes the bed, one checks the mini-bar, one fills the free coffee/tea/cookies. One brings creamer and water, and finally one turns down the bed in the evening. I found it a bit unnerving having that many strangers coming and going from my room. Maybe that is just me!!!I would have liked to have seen the concierge at the desk in the lobby more often, or the front desk staff cross trained to perform that task when necessary. We went a couple of times in the morning and had no luck, but in the afternoon, after we had been out most of the day on our own, then there was someone there. The hotel was clean and relatively quiet, but it seemed to be more of a business hotel than a tourist/family hotel. I probably would not return to Cambridge Suites.... maybe my expectations were too high based on its ratings here.

<Content>Cambridge Suites is the best I really can't think of a single thing to complain about with this hotel. The room was great, and the staff were helpful and very friendly. Their suites beat a regular room at a similarly priced hotel anytime. If $199 CAD is in your price range, this is the place to stay.

<Content>Fantastic hotel We arrived home yesterday after spending 5 nights at the Cambridge Suites and we had a wonderful time. It was a special occasion, my husband's 40th and the staff on the front desk sent him up a birthday card and 2 wonderful plates of fresh fruit and cheeses as a way of wishing him a happy birthday. The room was immaculate and everything you could ever want to make an enjoyable stay was provided. The staff were friendly and helpful and went out of their way to assist in anyway possible. The breakfast was lovely, plentiful and fresh and certainly carried us well into the day before we even began to think about food again. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and with the added bonus that Niagara Falls was just over an hours drive away - what a wonderful place to spend your 40th birthday - we can certainly recommend this hotel highly and we would definately stay in the Cambridge Suites if ever we visit Toronto again.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay We stayed at Cambridge Suites for 4 nights and enjoyed it very much. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The location is perfect, with half a block away from a mall and a subway station and tons of shops and restaurants nearby. The continental breakfast is limited in variety, but very fresh and promptly refilled. What sets this hotel apart from its peers are the little things indicating a nice caring human touch: small notes forecasting the next day's weather, complimentary bottled water in the afternoon, etc. If we really have to nitpick, TVs in our rooms are both very dated with distorted colors. Then again, TV watching was not the highlight of our stay ;-) In summary, we highly recommend this hotel and will definitely put it on the top of the list for our next stay in Toronto.

<Content>Fantastic cant fault it stay here We have just returned from a six night break to the cambridge suites it was hard to find fault with this hotel. As a family of four with two nearly teenage children the extra room provided in the suite was wonderful. The bedroom area could be closed off to enable kids to sleep, while we relaxed with a beer and T.V. or books. (tip if you dont want to use the mini bar then go to the LCBO store on Dundass / Younge, and stock up your in room fridge.) This hotel is well situated we walked everywhere as we had not hired a car, nowhere was far to go, CN tower, ferry to Islands, shopping, St lawrence market (wonderfull fresh produce), street cars, subway, and Path all within easy reach.I picked this hotel after reading other reports on this site and was not dissapointed. the only very minor fault was there was no milk for coffee in the fridge, however one phone call and it soon arrived. A Little touch that made our stay, was the evening bed turn down,with chocolates and complmentary bottles of water, plus the next days weather forcast to help you plan your day. The breakfast was always fresh and constantly topped up, providing a good start to the day, we rarely had lunch as we were still full. the bathroom was lovely and clean and always had lots of hot water. The room was also very quiet we never heard any noise from the adjacent or overhead suites.the Staff were all helpful and polite, we also extended our check out time by an hour to 3pm which meant we arrived at the airport freshly showered and unflustered for our evening flight home. Other hotels i considered were the delta chelsea and the novotel, i definately made the right choice. If we go to toronto again we will stay here. Eating out was great so much choice our kids loved eating at the old spaghetti factory (the Esplanade near the Novotel) dont be put off by the outside, it is wonderfull inside great meals ,good value for money as well. they also enjoyed the Armadillo Grill on front street west super ribs and tex mex food and an in house magician who visited the table he was brilliant. we had a fantastic time in toronto and loved the cambridge

<Content>Fantastic stay at the Cambridge Suites Hotel I decided to stay at the Cambridge Suites Hotel in Toronto based on the reviews here and I have to stay I was not dissappointed. I stayed from the 27th May until the 4th June and was happy from beginning to end. After being annoyed at the airport (immigration had a problem with me travelling with my children alone) I was in a foul mood but when I got to the hotel the genuine friendliness and helpfulness of the staff had me smiling. The suite was large CLEAN and comfortable. The air conditioning worked perfectly and my suite had plenty of light switches and lamps so the room was not dark at all. I was on the 12th floor and could see the top of the CN Tower from the windows. The minibar was always stocked (mainly because I didn't use it). The maid was thorough and friendly and always gave us extra towels. The evening turndown service was a nice touch especially the weather report for the next day.The complimentary breakfast in the suites was a blessing because the kids could eat whilst still in their PJs watching Teletoons on the TV whilst I was in the shower. Having 2 TVs with 2 kids was great and I came back to the UK with a full packet of headache pills. The location was fantastic (Richmond and Yonge) we were able to walk to most places within 10 minutes. We walked all the way down Yonge (took about 10-15 minutes) to Queen Quay and took the Ferry to Centre Island (stunning place). The path underground system which connects to the Eaton centre, Subway stations and numerous other buildings and shops is connected to the hotel. Lawrence Market is a couple or blocks away (we walked there practically everyday the Dominion Food Market across the road from there is a great place to get snacks fruit etc cheaper than the corner shops). We also walked to the CN Tower (a must for anyone visiting Toronto) and the Rogers Centre and took in the Toronto Blue Jays (another must family zone $9 a ticket for adults $6.30 for kids bargain very enjoyable and a safe atmosphere). The hotel is a gem believe me I walked past alot of hotels and the vast majority looked like dumps to me Hotel Victoria, Scrathcona, Sheraton and the Delta Chelsea to name a few. The great staff, appearance of Hotel and Suites as well as the location make this hotel a must stay for vistors to Toronto. I am already planning my next trip to Toronto and my children insist that they will not be happy staying anywhere else apart from the Cambridge Suites.

<Content>Very, very nice hotel! We stayed in this hotel 3 nights May 22 éˆ¥?25 and loved every second of being here. We had one bedroom suite with two TVs (one in the living room and one in the bedroom), with refrigerator, bar, microwave and much more. There was always a newspaper in the morning, also complimentary breakfast in the room. Rooms were nice and clean. Also there was a workout facility on the 22nd floor and Jacuzzi with sauna. Staff is friendly.Also there is a good restaurant and bar on the main floor. Hotel is conveniently located near the Yonge st and not far from the most other downtown attractions. We loved this hotel and will definitely return when visit Toronto next time.

<Content>Would have been perfect ..Really! ...except ... : -( What would have made things perfect but instead seemed to make every little annoyance worse was the horrible mattress. In the begining I made a mistake by not asking to change rooms but, I was staying such a short time and had so much that I wished to do that the thought of having to pack and change rooms seemed a greater inconvience... By the day of check out I realized what a mistake that decision had been. I was sooooo looking forward to the comfortable bed I had read about in the reviews!! At apperance level the bed looked wonderful! Both Myself and companion have back problems so when we woke stiff and sore after the first night, we made excuses saying 'perhaps we just need to get used to the mattress  maybe it was the pillows ...etc'. ( Though we haven't had that problem happen in other hotels we have stayed)We could bearly move the 4th morning, trying to pack for check out. Since I did not ask for another room it's not really fair to blame the Cambridge, but I thought I'd warn other's who wake from an uncomfortable nights sleep not to wait thinking it will get better. It won't! I'll also suggest if you run out of something in the room frig prior to the weekend, let them know before Friday afternoon because though there are several different people coming into the room to check on things daily, it seems the frig is not stocked daily and you will spend a dry thristy weekend! One last thing, if you have reason to use the spa you may want to be sure it is going to be in working order. After the pain and stiffness brought on by the mattress I was even more than looking forward to a nice long settle in the spa and enjoying that gorgious skyscape. But that last evening I was met with a sign saying the spa was closed.The room itself and the service offered by those employed was truly excellent! I did mention something about my problems upon leaving but I think the desk help thought I was looking for a discount or perhaps didn't understand my accent ( American) or something as he just shrugged it off. Again ... since I was leaving anyway I guess there wasn't really anything he could have said ...but it did make Me feel uncomfortable... and after some thought I decided to write in order to spare other's a painful ruined vacation.

<Content>Loved the place I stayed in the Cambridge Suites on 13th May for one night. it was my first visit to Toronto, and had read the reviews and decided this was the hotel for me....and the reviews were not wrong! this is a lovely place, tucked away just off Young Street so dead central, about 5 mins from Eaton Centre, but quitely hidden away. The staff in the lobby were all really friendly and helpful, letting me see a room before i booked. The spacious suite itself was very neat, tidy and clean, acres of room and good, clean cooking facility and fridge. i had a suite at the back, so the views were'nt tremedous, but the huge windows offered great vista of downtown Toronto. The huge bed was really comfortable, and turndown service was fine, though the water could have been colder. Free newspaper was nice to see when opened door in the morning. The continental breakfast is a DIY affair, the first time i have experienced this in a hotel. You toast your own toast or bagel, get your own coffee, etc, but the benefit being you can have as much as you want - always a bonus! Generally, i found the whole experience to be really, really good and enjoyable. Getting to and from airport no problem, there was always a taxi outside. Brilliant value for money too. I'd definantly stay there again.

<Content>Mainly a good experience but.... We enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Cambridge Suites  everything positive that other users have said about the suite facilities, good value complimentary breakfasts  location is correct. Also I should mention concierge Jennifer who arranged our airport pickup as well as a private tour of Niagara. She also went to a lot of trouble to find us a dinner dance venue on Saturday night - The Old Mill where there is dinner dancing Mon-Sat - very enjoyable if pricey. The front desk staff too were unfailingly courteous  helpful. BUT I was amazed at the absence of a room safe in a modern property. I like to place valuables in a secure place and it was a real nuisance having to go to the front desk each time to get something out, whether it was cash or credit cards. Other things that could be improved upon were the lighting - we were on 11th floor so suite was quite dark, the pillows - I think that they could offer the option of feather ones  the bath towels which were small, although they did give us 2 each as well as hand towels  face cloths. I would have preferred one proper sized bath towel. I'm not sure if we would return, as although our overall experience was excellent, I was really inconvenienced by the absence of a room safe.

<Content>Would Definitely Stay There Again My husband and I stayed here (on a Monday through Friday) for our wedding anniversary, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Upon knowing of the reason for our stay, the hotel staff made us feel very special, which was a nice surprise.Keep in mind that the photos you see of the very large rooms on various websites are the more expensive ones. But ours--with the sitting area, separate bedroom (plus two TVs!) was a perfect size for two people. Other things we liked:(1) Room was very well maintained(2) Extras like the bathrobes and turndown service were great(3) Hotel is very quiet, and is not extremely large(4) Great location--steps from the Path, subway and other sights(5) All the staff were friendly, helpful and very responsive to any requests (extra supplies for our room, restaurant recoomendations, directions, arranging sightseeing tours)(6) Wet bar area with the sink, microwave, mini-bar, mini-fridge and free goodies(7) Bathroom was spacious(8) Good closet space(9) We found the bed comfortableMinor room for improvement:(1) Our bathroom needed a little bit more lighting over the sink(2) Room service for continental breakfast forgot a couple of items toward end of our stay, but were prompt (and apologetic) in bringing up what we had requested. Keep in mind if you want large quantities of food, it's likely best to go the the breakfast buffet in the hotel dining room.(3) Would be ideal if room had a small armoire that could not only hold the TV but also provide an extra set of drawers.In closing, we were very pleased and will stay there again the next time we visit Toronto.

<Content>Good but Need to Step it Up a Notch Stayed at the Cambridge Suites Hotel with my wife for a weekend after checking pricing / Trip Advisor etc.Good Things:First off, relatively new, clean and modern - and very quiet.Second, pricing was the best of any comparable hotel in the area. Third, evening turn-down service was very well done c/w chocolates, card with weather forecast for the next day, and bottled water (although why they would deliver luke warm water every night is beyond me...).Fourth, the young lady at the concierge stand was very knowledgable and helpful. Thanks.Suggestions for Management to Turn it Up a Notch....First, king bed is the smallest I have ever seen. Definitely a quasi-king bed about 9 wider than a queen bed and not a full-size king. Bed was very hard. This alone made my wife want to change hotels.Second, house keeping should knock before entering - which they didn't. Luckily we were decent !! She did apologize though. Third, both tv's in our room faded from colour to dark purple and back again every minute or so. We asked staff on the first of three nights for replacement tv's. It never happened. Why ask again?? We shouldn't have to. Fourth, the very small lounge was always full so you could never get in. Finally, please deliver cold bottled water in the evening and not luke warm water! It will make all the difference. Oh yes, and if there are two guests in the room, you should deliver two bottles of water and not one.Otherwise, I would definitely give them another chance. While Cambridge advertises they are the best in Toronto, I have stayed at better hotels but none with the potential of this place for the price- provided they do turn it up a notch.

<Content>Review of Cambridge Suites Rooms: You have a choice of 2 room types (I believe), one has a better view, plus a nice little dining table for 2, while the other does not face downtown, and has a work desk instead of a dining table. Also, the rooms have a seperate bedroom and living room, it is pretty spacious. 2 TVs, and a well stocked Mini-bar also make a good addition. Very clean and comfortable rooms!Service: I have never had any problems in relation to service here. Anything you need, they'll bring up with a smile.Food: Very yummy stakes  ceaser salad. They have an assortment of room service items.Location: It is connected to the PATH, which is North America's largest underground mall system that connects to various locations, and subway stations. The hotel is physically located in a good area filled with shopping and bars. Taxis are always waiting outside.Free Breakfast: They serve sealed yogurt, an assortment of bread/bagles/pasteries and such. Cereal  fruit are aslo available.Hint: I've always bought from Expedia because they always seem to offer a better rate than the hotel itself.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location We have just come back from our first trip to Toronto where we stayed at The Cambridge Suites Hotel. We booked the hotel online with no trouble and found that the Hotel itself was exactly as other reviewers had claimed. It was clean, well furnished, had large rooms and a great location. The beds are massive and comfortable and there is satellite TV in both rooms. There is an optional Video Games console and even a microwave to complement the tidy mini-bar. The Bar Staff were friendly the Front Desk were also helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend this Hotel to anyone staying in Toronto. Tip for anyone who has not been before...hire a car from Union Station for a day and go to Niagara Falls, its easy to do and the road to Niagara is straightforward. Its unforgettable when you are there, just avoid the over-commercialised area set back from the road and carry on down to Niagara-on-the-lake instead its beautiful.

<Content>Nice facilities but top notch staff! I've had the pleasure of staying at this hotel twice in the new year for business the first time, and I was so satisfied I returned with my family on vacation recently. This hotel is by far one of the best I've stayed in. The hotel is connected to the underground walkway which is great on bad weather days. The suites are two rooms so they have a seperate bedroom and livingroom areas, and each has its own television. Breakfast is included and they can deliver to the room too.What I love the most about this place however is the staff. I have never met a more service oriented and genuinely friendly group of people. Whether it's asking how my day is going, or saying hi or smiling when I walk into the lobby, they are top notch! On a recent stay I was waiting in the lobby for my son and husband to return to the hotel and must have sat and watched the front desk for an hour and a half or so. Those men and women were superb! Whether it was a recommendation, checking someone out or answering the phone, each one of them did it with a smile and professionalism you'd expect from the finest of hotels. The location of this place can't be beat, and the facilities are so clean, comfortable and well priced. The beds are heavenly, the extra space so nice to have and the overall value is unbeatable.

The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are large. It is across the street from Eaton Center and the PATH downtown. You can walk to almost anywhere! The exercise facilities are fantastic as well..

<Content>The place to stay in Toronto Whenever we go to Toronto, my husband and I stay at the Cambridge Suites. This hotel is extremely comfortable and very convenient to the Hummingbird Center. The suites are very roomy, the bathrooms well appointed, and service is excellent. Being connected to the PATH is also a plus that we especially appreciated on a snowy April 2nd visit.

<Content>OK but not great The hotel itself was nice and the location was good, especially being on the PATH system and so close to The Bay and The Eaton Centre. The room itself however was a little outdated, the bathroom fittings and shower doors were rusting, the tv sets in both rooms had poor picture quality, and the kitchenette facilities were quite disappointing. Usually we book through last minute sites and pay a fraction of the price, only to end up with one of the poorer quality rooms in a hotel, this time we booked directly with the hotel and still got what we felt was a poorer quality room so I don't know if all the rooms are like this or we're just unlucky! All in all I'd say if you can get a good price then it's worth it, but if you pay normal rate like we did then you will leave feeling a little ripped off.

<Content>Great Experience Stayed at the Suites before Christmas. The location is absolutely fabulous!Very close to the Eaton Centre, and the subway line. There are only a few rooms on each floor, and they are very private. The service was excellent. We had a plumbing issue, and the serviceman was at the door within minutes of calling. Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>It's been a long time since I've had such a nice experience... Stayed here over the weekend for a conference and I canéˆ¥æª› say enough about this place. The room is terrific éˆ¥?clean, comfortable, quiet, nice view, and soooooooooo great to have the extra space. The staff was friendly, polite and helpful (? have they gone to the Ritz Carlton college of hotel niceness??!) Even the complimentary breakfast was better than I expected for the price of my room. Next time I am in Toronto, you better believe I will stay here.

<Content>Feb. 26th, 2005 Treated my Wife to a birthday evening night on the town and from all the rave reviews of the Cambridge Suites I had to come and try it out. I stayed in one of the skyscape suites on the upper floors and the view was pretty good. The service is very good and the hotel staff was very happy to help me decorate my room for my wife while we were out for dinner. I was very dissappointed in the quality of the bath towels and the shower head was very clogged, which made your shower time some what cold.They also have complimentary continental breakfast delivered to your room in the morning and I had checked delivery at 9:00 a.m. and at 9:10 a.m I called to find out where our breakfast was and they were just leaving and had 30 orders to deliver and since my floor was very high (20) they said it would be 15 to 20 minutes.All in all the room is a little smaller than what I had imagined, but very well put together and all the comforts at home. I probably wouldn't stay there again unless they have an unbelievable special.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Staff There's not a wrong word I can say about this hotel. The hotel it self is in a great location, but that hasn't got a stitch on the staff that are worth double their weight in gold.Their main objective is making the guest feel as comfortable as possible and your stay as harmonised as possible. I couldn't fault them in any way and they were always happy to help be it from the little things such as info on opening times, to arranging days out. You simply tell them what you want to do and they will tell you the best area to visit how to get there, etc...This is a team that works and has that friendly professional attitude, they are just so customer focused.The rooms are more like mini apartments; they are clean to the highest standard. Clarita kept my room to the best possible standard.To round it off, this hotel provides exactly what I needed for travelling alone: safety, security, comfort, and location.Why this hotel isn't a 5star I don't know.

<Content>Great Location, Excellent Value Weekend of Feb 4-6, 2005  Perfect location for a girl's weekend! The concierge was most helpful prior to our arrival. Best views are high floors facing east - unfortunately, none of these have 2 double beds. Our room was very clean and had all the amendities we needed (free coffee, water, popcorn). The bedroom was on the small side but the living and dressing areas were nice and big.  Eaton Centre is a short block away (no need to go outside) and the theatre district is less than a $10 cab ride away.  Free continental breakfast was very good. We had it in the conference room the first morning and had it delivered on Sunday morning.  Didn't use the jaccuzi - was not very hot. Gym only has a few machines but nobody was there when we went. There's also a sauna - it was off.  Would definitely return.

<Content>Hard to find fault We were looking for a hotel within walking distance of the Eaton's Centre and made our booking based on the review's of the Cambridge Suites Hotel. We were not disappointed. Easy access by car, well lit underground parking, courteous staff, and very clean well appointed suites. And you have to love having a full suite as opposed to simply a room. The extra space was nice and the convenience of amenities such as two tv's, extra closet space, wet bar, fridge, dishes and microwave were greatly appreciated. Little extras did not go unnoticed too such as real wine glasses, wine corkscrew, and full size ironing board with iron. This review would not be complete without mentioning the concierge, Andrew. This polite young man provided us with exceptional service and was very friendly, knowledgeable, and went out of his way to make sure he provided us with the services we were looking for. He alone in our opinion would be reason to return. All in all based on our experience it would be very difficult to find fault with this hotel. We were very very impressed and will definitely return as well as recommed this hotel to friends and family.

<Content>Superb My Girlfriend and I arrived on the night of the Blackout and were told it was probably best if we find another hotel. After recomending two or three we choose the King Edward for that night and then to come back to Cambridge the following day. The Cambridge was by far superiour to the King Edward. Service was outstanding, all members of staff made us feel welcome and it felt more like living in our own apartment than a hotel.Most memorable moment was drinking cocktails while watching the show fall with my girlfriend while chatting to Shelly the Barmaid (one hell of a bar tender).Great view from the room, and although small, didn't feel cramped in the slightest.Definatly booking again!!!

<Content>Great Staff Stayed for a weekend with the girls shopping. The rooms were a bit smaller than I expected but very clean. The staff go out of their way to make your stay great. I would stay there again. Also, the location is great for shopping and dining.

<Content>Grace under pressure My husband and I just finished a couple nights stay at the Cambridge Suites and must say this hotel is extraordinary! We really enjoyed the suite, which was extra large, nicely appointed and well maintained. The extras this hotel provides is what I like most, real attention to detail! They have a standard 2pm check-out which is great for those who don't want to feel rushed to leave the morning of departure. The continental breakfast is good, and each night they leave a little card on the bed at turndown service to say what the weather will be like the next day. They just really make you feel welcome and pampered.What really impressed me however, is this hotels grace under pressure if you will. The last night of our stay there was a huge power blackout in Downtown Toronto and it was also one of the coldest days of the year. There was a certain bit of confusion among guests and uncertainty but the staff at this hotel were second to none!The Manager on Duty made regular announcement to keep guests informed as to the situation ( as she knew it) the Front Desk offered to assist in any way they could offering blankets and water all the while being very polite and friendly. It was like nothing was going on that was different than usual.I was in the lobby at one point (which was freezing cold due to the opening of the doors from people entering and exiting) and all the Front Desk clerks had their coats on but continued to serve guests with the utmost of care! I even heard one employee speaking Portugese or Italian to some distraught guests who didn't speak english.The care and professionalism these employees showed given the unique and cold circumstances was so impressive. They all deserve a real pat on the back! It would have been easy for a hotel to drop the ball so to speak in this kind of situation, but these men and women hit a home run! Congratulations to all, I will be back!

<Content>Cocooning at the Cambridge The love of my life and I just returned from an outstanding weekend at the Cambridge. We decided to have a cocooning weekend as the weather outside was cold, snowy and blustery. We stayed indoors all weekend, ok, ok, I couldn't resist and did venture to the Eaton Centre! The boutique-type hotel, is small enough to be intimate but it's location makes it very cosomopolitan. The staff were friendly and brought a sense of hominess to the hotel. Extra little touches everywhere you go, bowls of fruit by the elevator on each floor, bathrobes in the room, and turn-down service. The restaurant food was adequate but on our next visit we will venture out to other restaurants. Unfortunately, on Sunday morning, downtown Toronto was hit with a power failure which meant the hotel was without heat and lighting other than auxiliary power. But even that didn't damper the weekend. The worse scenario would have meant we were forced to stay another day in this little piece of paradise! But alas, all good things must come to a end, and I'm home but we will return to the Cambridge sooner rather than later

<Content>One of my favourites I've stayed at many hotels in my time, and this has to be one of my all time favourites anywhere in the world! The rooms are large, clean, and at a great price!Two televisions are always a bonus, and they offer free continental breakfast delivered to your room! I have yet to see that anywhere else!The staff are knowledgeable and VERY friendly. Always welcoming us with a smile, or asking how our day is going on an elevator trip.My favorite part of this hotel are the ladies who answer the phone. I say ladies because I have yet to hear a man answer. On several occaisions I have had to ask for directions or information and they are always able to help. So many times hotel operators simply patch you through to the Front Desk, where you have to sit on hold sometimes for 5 minutes just waiting to have your simple question answered. The ladies on switchboard at this hotel always assist me with queries I may have. Cudos to them. This place is a real class act.

<Content>Wonderful New Year's Eve My husband and I stayed at this hotel for New Year's and it was fantastic. The hotel was busy, as we could see anytime we passed through the lobby, and yet we hardly heard a peep all night in our room! The suite we had was very spacious, with two seperate rooms, a lare vanity/dressing room and comfortable size washroom.The staff were so friendly and welcoming, it was a nice change from where we normally stay. This hotel has character and charm, unlike many of the other big name, 600 room plus, chain hotels in Toronto which as one other reviewer put it correctly, are more like bed factories! The Cambridge Suites was just superb.Check-in and check-out were efficient, and delivering the continental breakfast to the suite each morning at no charges was great! I was surprised at this offering, someone is certainly thinking out of the box here.Great people, great location and great hotel. A five star in our books!

<Content>Excellent - No Other Words Spent 4 nights here Dec 15th - Dec 19th. We are a family of 3 -(9 year old son) from UK. Excellent Hotel, from the greeting to the checking out.We wanted a hotel near the centre but usually find city hotels, small and not very clean or friendly. Not the Cambridge Suites - Excellent on all accountsRecomended to all

<Content>Top Notch My husband and I stayed at the Cambridge just before Christmas. We did some shopping and spent Christmas Eve together in the hotel. It was great!The rooms are incredibly spatious, and a GREAT PRICE! I did some shopping around before we decided and found many area hotels had a standard room, without all the extras of the Cambridge, for more money!The staff were all friendly and helpful. The concierge and Front Desk staff have terrific recommendations and know the area extensively. We were never disappointed with anything they suggested.The jacuzzi on the 22nd floor has AMAZING views on the city, it is a very romantic place at night with the city lights twinkling around!The hotel is connected to the path which made shopping at the Eaton Centre a breeze, esepcially during the cold weather. All in all, one of my favourite hotels, one of the best I've stayed in.

<Content>Nice Rooms, Not So Clean Bathrooms Definitely up there in regards to class and standards, however at a hotel like this you'd expect cleaner bathrooms. Staff is pretty good, however after spending one night there and experiencing the joy of a 4 legged creature crawling on your face in the middle of the night, I'd never stay there again!

<Content>Noticeable attention to detail This hotel is great! It was my first time and I will definately be back! The rooms are spacious, VERY clean and beautifully decorated. The continental breakfast is always appreciated, especially when they deliver it to the suite, STILL COMPLIMENTARY! We layed in bed, got our snuggly house coats on (also provided free) and enjoyed our free breakfast delivered to the room.Turndown each night was lovely. The radio was turned on to a classical station, there are chocolates on the pillow and a light turned on. Very nice to come home to.The staff are top notch! Especially the Front Desk and Housekeeping. Never before has a housekeeping staff been so talkative and friendly as the ones here. They ask me how my day is going, ask if there is anything I need... most of the time housekeepers make you feel like you are impeding there work and are tolerant of you to say the least. But this hotels Housekeeping department were tremednously friendly and accommodating.Front Desk staff were so friendly and polite. Sayed hi when we would walk bye the desk, or ask us how our dinner was. Just a class act all around.I would recommend this hotel to anyone! The location is great, prices affordable (even when you book direct with them, cheap rates even without using Priceline and Expedia) a GREAT hotel.

<Content>Great holiday We booked our stay at the Cambridge Suites based on the glowing reports we had read on this site and we weren't disappointed. We had a standard room, it was quite large (we are from the UK so are used to things being on a smaller scale) and was ideal for a week's holiday as it was a little like having your own 1 bedroom flat rather than being in a hotel room. The reception staff were friendly and polite and the concierge service was very efficient (we used it to book a hire car). We took our swimsuits (planned ahead after reading the review on here) and tried out the whirlpool and sauna on the top floor. It was great - after a morning's shopping and wandering around the city what better than a whirlpool overlooking the rooftops of the city. It even snowed outside while we were in the lovely, warm bath!The hotel is a stone's throw from the Eaton Centre and is on the PATH system so you can go out without having to face the bleak winter weather. It's also near the Queen subway station (also accessible via PATH) so ideally located. We didn't try the restaurant, but we had the complimentary continental breakfast every day. They could have done with a few more tables, but to be honest we were having such a great time we didn't care that we had to wait a few minutes for a seat on one morning. I'd certainly recommend the Cambridge Suites.

<Content>Great Fire Alarm While the hotel is nice - it isn't without it's problems. First the good - the beds were comfortable and the suite area was nice to have. Now the bad - the bathrooms were disgusting. There were obvious signs of mold and the walls on the inside by the door were not clean. While having a drink in the bar we happened upon a little visitor (four legged - grey - with a long tail), that the staff didn't seem to concerned about. Thank goodness we did not eat in the restauraunt. The continental breakfast was ok - but not up to the standards that they were spoken of here.Nice fire alarm at 1 am (because they had not changed the batteries - it sent off every alarm in the hotel). Good luck parking in the parking garage if you own anything larger than a GEO Metro.The staff was nice - although we never saw the conceirge - and there were absolutely no maps of the downtown area available.We will visit Toronto again - but certainly not this hotel.

<Content>nice place Very nice place, We got the city scape room. Wish we would have brought bathing suits the pool was very nice. We did not spend much time there though. Next time we will get a cheaper room because all we did is sleep there. We ordered 2 drinks from the bar to be brought up. The charge was $35 for 2 regular drinks- yikes... We ordered them at last call while at the bar. They carried them up and charged lots! The breakfast is very nice and free!

<Content>I'll Be Back Stayed at the Cambridge Suites Nov 5-7 for about US$120/night (Expedia) for a weekend getaway. To be honest, for the price I was expecting a so-so experience and I assumed a fair number of the positive reviews might have been submitted by hotel employees. But all those glowing reviews turned out to be true. Unless you're looking for $300/night luxury, this is a fantastic place to stay. Immaculately clean; quiet; close to public transportation (I took the subway and bus from the airport for about US$2); within walking distance of major shops, the theater district, Chinatown, etc. And friendly staff. Oh, and of course, the size of the rooms -- which was the major selling point for me. (I am almost afraid to submit this review because I don't want everyone else going there and increasing the price of a room -- but then it's already #1 on TripAdvisor ...)

<Content>Quiet, convenient Toronto hotel Cambridge Suites was a great choice for us (middle aged couple with no kids) spending 4 nights in Toronto on vacation. It's a relatively small hotel (only a few rooms on each floor) with mainly business travellers, so it is quiet, and the service is excellent. It is one of only 3 in the Cambridge Suites chain, and it has nice little details like original art, and fresh fruit in bowls outside the elevator. The price was similar to other upper-moderate hotels in the area (about $160 US per night).The suite was big enough to give us a little personal space when we needed it (for example, one person watched the World Series in the living room, the other watched Survivor in the bedroom). The living room has a sleep sofa, coffee table, TV, and chair, and a small dining table. There are a couple of closets -- one in the hall, and one in the dressing area (which has a built-in dresser in the vanity). Robes and an iron and hair dryer are provided.On the weekday mornings when breakfast was only available until 9 a.m. we had it delivered to the room (no additional charge, other than optional gratuity); on the weekend mornings we went down to the second floor to get the full buffet selection -- no hot dishes, but plenty of choice for juice, cereals, pastries, beverages, etc. The bar/snack kitchen in the room was great -- sink, fridge, coffee maker, microwave, minibar, dishes/flatware.The room comes with a basket of teas, coffee, cookies, and microwave popcorn that is re-filled daily. The ice bucket was filled, and a next day weather report, complimentary chocolates and milk for coffee were delivered each evening with the turndown of the bed.There is a fitness center on the 22nd floor -- including a Jacuzzi and a sauna with views out over the city. The fitness equipment is basic (treadmill, stairstepper, elliptical machine, bike and hand weights), but more than adequate (there is a TV and dressing rooms also). If you need more, you can get a free day pass to a nearby health club.The location is great -- on the corner of Yonge and Richmond, one block south of Queen (and the Eaton Center), where you can pick up the subway or streetcar. It's only a couple of blocks to theatres or the St. Lawrence Market area. Except for a drive to the zoo, we walked or took public transit everywhere. Underground parking at the hotel is $16CA on weekdays, and $12CA on weekends.The only quibble we might have is that the room was too hot (there is a thermostat, but adjusting it according to the instructions didn't work). However, we didn't inform the hotel staff of this, so we don't know if they could have fixed it. Also, there is a window that can be opened in the bedroom -- this helped some (but an open window also lets in the street noise, alas).

<Content>A very nice hotel... This is a very nice hotel, and centrally located. The suites are large and tastefully furnished, with big windows looking out at skyscrapers across the street. The rooms are immaculate and the broadband connection is brilliant (i.e., fast and free). So, all in all, it's a convenient and commodious place to stay---with the added bonus that there are always taxis waiting outside to take you wherever you want to go. That I haven't given the hotel five stars is owing to two things: 1) There's no real view, to speak of, and no special ambiance; this is Toronto, after all, not San Francisco or Beirut; 2) the bathrooms are okay, but not not much more than that. Weak shower. Not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel.

<Content>Always the best By far the best place in town to stay!I am often in town on business, and usually my company will make my reservation for the Sheraton which is just down the street!I tried the Cambridge once based on the rave reviews I had heard, and have yet to be disapointed! The service is excellent, the rooms are large, the price is often less than the Sheraton and it is intimate and cozy!Whenever I am in business in Toronto, I will cancel my Sheraton booking and stay here instead! By far the best place in town!

<Content>Toronto's Hidden Gem My husband and I recently had the pleasure of enjoying the Cambridge Suites hotel in Toronto.What a gorgeous place! The suites are all VERY large, all two rooms with beautiful furnishings and great decorating. The staff was extremely friendly from the Front Desk to the room attendant everyone was just great!The hotel is located right downtown minutes to the Eaton Centre and Hockey Hall of Fame. It is connected to the Underground Mall so we didn't even have to go outside to shop! We were right there.The best part about this hotel is that not only is it superior than the big chain hotels in downtown Toronto, but its soooo much quieter. The Front Desk agent said the hotel was sold out, but we didn't hear a peep all night. Only 12 rooms per floor.Check-out the HUGE Jacuzzi on the 22nd Floor. Its a city oasis as you are surrounded by windows overlooking Downtown Toronto. Just lovely. The sauna and gym are also located here and provide for a great work-out OR relaxing environment.Only complaint is that the beds were TOO comfortable. I almost didn't want to get out of bed!Keep up the good work Cambridge Suites, and open some hotels down here in the US!!!

<Content>Dream trip We are so glad we chose Cambridge Suites for our first trip to Toronto. The suite was comfortable - the bed was enormous - and the service was excellent. All hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Room service and housekeeping service are excellent, we could not fault them. We felt so pampered by the little touches. The continental breakfast exceeded our expectations and we were amazed by the choice and quality of the food served in the hotel. The restaurant may seem expensive at first glance, but when your food arrives it really is value for money.The laundry in the basement was a godsend, the fitness suite on the top floor, although small and basic was underused and we had no problems getting in, the whirlpool spa was huge fun and the views at night are great.The location is wonderful, we went all around Toronto, mainly on foot but the subway and trolley bus stations are nearby. The hotel is in the financial district as so is quiet at night and on weekends. There are shops , restaurants, theatres and the all important ATMs within minutes of the hotel.We would definitely choose The Cambridge Suites for our next visit.

<Content>8 days in Toronto Stayed 15th - 23rd September 2004.. Well there is only one word for the Cambridge suites - Excellent... Excellent value for money, Excellent service, Excellent staff, Excellent rooms (some might say they are small suites but hey they are good) Excellent breakfast ( part of the price) an Excellent Wednesday free drinks in the club room, Excellent city to stay in and an excellent location for the hotel ( but first impressions might be misleading but venture out and you'll discover the Toronto experience) don't expect a view from your hotel room but try to get on the front side of the hotel.. back of hotel overlooks a carpark don't worry about this as there is so much to do in Toronto... say hi to Kate on the fontdesk very helpful and if you go shopping in GAP at the Eaton centre say hi to Victor...

<Content>Perfect Location, Low Price, Large Suites My husband and I stayed for the Labor Day weekend with our nieces/nephew in 3 suites. I requested a low floor (less than 4th- we got 5th which was fine w/ me) and all suites on same floor- which we also got. The rooms are large, well kept up, all with nice views. All the following is included w/ price: There is daily maid service and turn down service; There is room service breakfast; M-Sat Toronto Globe/Mail paper; free safes @ front desk. The front lobby is small and not conducive to lounging, bar is well worn, continential breakfast set up crowded on a holiday weekend (that's why we opted for room service)- but those are my only criticisms,  minor. The hotel is VERY well located just off Younge, across the corner from The Bay dept store/Eaton center, walking distance to Hockey Hall of Fame, theatre district. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay and would highly recommend!!!!!

<Content>Great stay After relying so heavily on the reviews here, I just wanted to say how accurate the review of the Cambridge Suites have been. We just got back from 5 nights in Toronto and had a great time.The hotel was very clean, the staff was extremely friendly and I would highly recommend it.We went with our 2.5 year old daughter  the staff was very child friendly. Having a separate room for her to sleep in was key for us.If you are going to Toronto, it's a great place to stay.

<Content>great stay at cambridge suites I usually stay at my mother's when in Toronto but this time we went with friends and decided to stay at the Cambridge Suites. The rooms were really great for the price (booked through a discount service)although the hotel also has good weekend rates. Breakfast was more than adequate, and there's nothing better than 2 rooms, with refrigerator, microwave, 2 televisions etc... Staff was friendly and we would definitely stay again. Tip - grab a cab to the end of Bay, get on a ferry to Ward's island (5 minutes), and eat outdoors at the regency cafe - then walk the boardwalk along the lake. Great views, clean air and totally fabulous.

<Content>Perfect Honeymoon I stayed here June 12th 2004 for my honeymoon - what more can I say, other than it was excellent.The hotel staff were friendly and helpfull when you ask for help but generally leave you in peace, which I liked. The review from 18th June 2004 pretty much covers everything I would have said about the room and the hotel. There's also a small gym upstairs, very basic but enough for a half hearted attempt at maintaining a fitness regime whilst on holiday. It's hardly used so the jacuzzi and steamroom are perfect for winding down and chilling out.Couldn't think of anything bad to say about the hotel, it was the perfect honeymoon stay.

<Content>Perfect! This is definitely a hotel I'll recommend to friends. The location was ideal (just 1/2 a block east off Yonge and one block south of Queen) for shopping and touring Yonge Street (just go 2 blocks north for the younger crowd) and in a very safe area. The closest subway station is at Yonge and Queen and there was always cabs waiting at the door so getting around was very easy. Their staff was friendly, personable and helpful. The underground parking ($12-18/day) was appreciated. The rooms are well-represented in the photos and kept immaculate. We couldn't hear any neighbors although the hotel was quite crowded when we were there for 4 nights.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel- Treated like Royality The rooms were very spacious! The turn-down service at night was a treat. The Manager's reception was tasty and the free beverages were nice. Quiet Hotel, Great Service. The Manager toook the time to give us brochures on Tourist attractions and good places to eat for a family.

<Content>Ideal location, really roomy - what else do I need ? I was attending a conference in Toronto with my wife, but all the conference hotels were booked. I found this hotel via Expedia and got an OK rate. I was attracted by this being an all-suite hotel.When I got to Toronto, I was soon in a bad mood. The last time I was there was 10 years ago, and I left with a pretty good impression. This time, I was met with bad manners and almost frank rudeness. The airport staff were unfriendly, the airport bus staff were unsympathetic to someone who had just gotten off a 13 hour flight, and even the average citizen seemed pretty ill-manered. To top it off, my foul-mouthed taxi driver even tried to short-change me very blatantly before I complained. I was very disappojted with T.O.: this wasn't the freindly city I visited 10 years ago !Fortunately, when I finally arrived at the Cambridge Suites Hotel, things took a welcome change for the better. Check-in was quick and efficient (albeit not as warm or friendly as I had hoped). The whole hotel was more like a posh service apartment in downtown rather than a grand hotel. The lobby and the corridors were cozy and comfortale rather than extravagant - but that's how I like them.But it was the rooms that really made me smile again. Simply put, these rooms are BIG. There is actually a proper sitting room with a comfortable couch that can be closed off from the bedroom. There's a usable work desk - not an after-thought plank you find in most chain hotels. There's 2 separate TV's - one in the bedroom. There's plenty of storage space: a commodity often in short supply in many chain hotels. The 'kitchenette' was basically a bar with sink, microwave and a fridge - small but adequate for short-stays. The lighting was typical hotel-dim, but overall the effect was warm. I was really staisfied.I noticed the hotel offered several nice touches. The option of free contiental breakfast in your own room, the invitation to free drinks with the managerial staff once a week (I didn't have time to go), the offer to help you stock up on groceries if you give them a shopping list ... Although I didn't make use of all the facilities and services on this stay, I was comforting to know they were available. I DID use the top-floor gym and jacuzzi - what fantastic views from up there ! The gym area was not huge, but then again, there was no-one else using it most of the time and that gave you a nice feeling of having your own private exec gym overlooking all of east T.O. The one facility I most liked was surprisingly the self-service laundromat. For a week-long stay, I appreciate being able to do a tiny bit of laundry myself (hotel laundry services are terribly expensive and too ostentatious for my tastes). The basement laundromat was squeaky clean, well-lit and very convenient.As I stayed there for a whole week, I quickly learned to appreciate the location of this hotel. It is essentially at the eastern edge of the downtown skyscraper district. That means that although it is in the heart of the city, it is reasonably quiet. It is across the street from Hudson's Bay, and a very short walk away from the Eaton Centre. Best of all, the hotel is connected via its basement to Toronto's PATH network of underground walkways and shopping areas. It is possible to walk from the hotel to any of the main downtown shopping malls, the central bus terminus, the Cty Hall, the Union Station, and even to just outside the CN Tower without 'surfacing' and getting wet in the rain/snow. Via PATH, I can walk to the nearest Subway station within a few minutes. That was simply ideal for me to get to and from the conference I was attending each day - who needs a conference hotel ?However, I still could not give the maximum 5 stars to this hotel because of a few minor gripes. You may find this nit-picking, but I'm very selective about giving 5 stars to anyone. Here goes:- Yes, this is downtown, but the parking fee is still pretty steep. If it weren't I'd have rented a car for a few days more. The basement carpark was really convenient.- The lower rooms (like the one I had) had NO view whatsoever. You looked straight into someone's office. Here's a tip: ask for a room on a HIGH floor, looking EAST (away from the nearby skyscrapers).- The service was efficient rather than friendly and warm. The more I stayed, the more I was made to feel like a passenger rather than a guest. I wasn't too concerned personally, because I generally prefer to be left alone when I get back to the hotel after a day at the conference rather than getting fussed over by over-zealous staff. But I reckon some others would want a more personal service at a hotel.- Free internet access is only available to the high-priced suites. In the 'normal' suites (like mine), the charge was pretty steep. Many other hotels now offer free LAN access in all rooms, so shouldn't the Cambridge Suites also consider this ?Conclusion ?This is a hotel I would recommend to my friends. The room size and location are really big pluses - especially given the quite reasonable rrom rates. If you want grandeur and butler-like service, this is NOT the place for you. But if appreciate having a really comfortable home away from home (yet still remain downtown), this is certainly a good choice.
