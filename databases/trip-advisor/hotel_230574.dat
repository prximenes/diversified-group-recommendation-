<Content>First Class Hotel Stayed at the InterCon twice for one night each after flying in from Canada and a few weeks later again before returning.The hotel is nicely located at the River Main quay and close to the train station. City Centre area is about a 20min walk. distance to the airport about 15 min by cab (depending on traffic I guess). The room was nice with minibar (expensive), safe and a small LCD TV with a lot of international channels. Beds and linen were extremely comfortable! Bathroom had very nice amenities and nice black marble. Front desk staff was friendly, did not have any other interaction with staff as I did not use the restaurant, etc. As I work in the hotel industry myself I was disappointed with the type of comment card they provide. No space for own comments and not even space for your name, room number and address!! This is unbelievable to me - how can they improve their services, also room related, if they don't ask for room numbers. How can they fix problems? I have on purpose put my room number and name down as I was curious if I would get a reply but I of course haven't heard from them since. I worked in 5* and 3* hotels in Germany and Canada and both hotels reply to each and every comment card, no matter if positive or negative. This is however the only negative comment I can give about this hotel.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised Booked two nights in Frankfurt through Hotwire without knowing which hotel I麓d wind up with until after my booking. Was pretty comfortable with it being the InterContinental as the price was ridiculously low and it being a 5star. Friendly doorman parked our rent-a-car just outside the hotel (saved us a bunch in parking fee) and a friendly gentleman at reception let us upgrade from the Hotwire room with a city view to a lovely room with a beautiful river view, for about 20 Euros. Location was great, we had warm, sunny weather and enjoyed walking along the river and into the old part of town. Also across the river is a lovely museum worth visiting.Can highly recommend the Signature restaurant on the ground floor, great food and top notch service.Just really happy with this deal from Hotwire.

<Content>Good location, solid business hotel This elderly and large business hotel is approx. 10 walking mins. from the main train station and depending on time of day just less than 20 taxi mins. away from the airport. My deluxe room on the 10th floor was very spacious, with a sofa and a huge window front and a walkable balcony with view on the river Main and the neighbourhood of Sachsenhausen. There was a inroom safe, a working desk with LAN connection at charge (mine didn鈥檛 work) and surprisingly still with a CRT TV monitor. Ironing set at request from housekeeping. The little bathroom had a bathtub with good water pressure. The fitness center on the ground floor was equipped ok but with outdated treadmills and weight machines. The walk to the city center with e.g. European Central Bank or the 鈥淢aintower鈥?with an observation desk at the height of 200 meters took approx. 15 mins. at the same distance you鈥檇 also get to the neighbourhood of Sachsenhausen at the main street 鈥楽chweizer Strasse鈥?with all the cozy restaurants. The location of the hotel is central no wonder I could hear the close by busy street along the river Main. Breakfast buffet was between 06.30-10.30am as I left earlier I can鈥檛 rate this.My stay was ok and short.

<Content>Great staff at this convenient hotel We stayed at this hotel before catching a flight out of the Frankfurt airport. The staff at this hotel is fabulous and so friendly from the moment you walk in the hotel We had a very comfortable room with an amazing view of the Main river. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was modern and updated. This is a great hotel for any traveler. The airport is easy to get to from this hotel and it is centrally located in Frankfurt.

<Content>Not worth the money, Noisy room, hard bed I just got back from my stay and I must say I was quite disappointed.As others have mentioned before, this hotel has two towers. If you bid on HotWire like I did, you will end up in the City Tower. While the room is still nice, it is incredibly noisy. Is stayed on the 12th floor, and it sounded like the cars were lining up right outside my window. I complained and tried to move to another room, but they were full, or unwilling to move me.The room was a bit small by US standards, but decent sized by European standards. It was equipped with 2 twin beds which seems pretty typical. The beds were very firm to the point of being a bit uncomfortable. I had a terrible sleep my last night.Also note that some room rates include breakfast. If you purchase on HW, your rate will not include breakfast. The breakfast buffet is 27eur which is quite steep, although it is a nice spread. There are many walk up restaurants within a few blocks, but nothing else immediately surrounding the hotel.Some sites list this hotel as 5* but I don't believe it is. It is fairly equivalent to many US 4* hotels, with the addition of a bathrobe and slippers, and some above average soaps, etc.The hotel charges you for everything, as you would expect from a business hotel. I racked up nearly $20 in phone charges, and that was after I used a pre-paid calling card!The room has wireless internet access, available for a fee. The lobby in the main hotel has a 1-hour free wireless zone where many hotel guests brought their laptops and checked e-mail. Overall, I don't think I would stay here again due to the high price and the fact that I had a terribly noisy room.

<Content>A business hotel first and foremost Everyone was efficient. And smart.The room was well-proportioned and equipped and we had a lovely view of the river.Large lobby with open-plan bar that offered speedy service.Well-presented restaurant that oozed that hotel restauarant kind of decor that was impossible to dislike but unmemorable at the same time.All very up to date with the brand standards ! A proper Intercon !We had no complaints. But we do have an observation !This is is a big hotel and the weekend we were there, completely over-run with a convention such that there were more coat racks in the lobby than I have ever seen before ! There were convention people running everywhere ! All weekend !That's why I suppose I wanted to post this review. Just because, efficient and comfortable as it is, that kind of trade is important to the hotel and, I imagine, likely to be frequent. But it left us feeling a little bit out of place. Combined with the slick but big feel of the place we concluded that perhaps this wouldnt be a place we'd rush back to or recommend for a weekend break. For business ? Absolutely. But we stayed at Meridien Parkhotel last time we came for a weekend and just found it more characterful and relaxed than this one. I think I'd rather send a fax from the Intercon than spend a Saturday night there again ! But give me a briefcase and a laptop and I'd return there happily the following Monday morning !!

<Content>Great Location, Great Club Lounge, Rooms need some TLC Large property in a good location alongside the River with excellent views. Hotel is comprised of two towers - be sure to ask for accommodations in the larger tower vs. the smaller older one across the street. Don't be afraid of the appearance from the outside - a 1960's concrete Holiday Inn-ish looking building. Inside it is quite nice - although it does have a bit of an early 1990's feel to it. I had a Club Studio room which is basically a Junior Suite - one large room with separate sitting area with loveseat and two chairs, a comfortable bed, and large bathroom with separate bathtub and huge shower. Overall, the room was showing some wear and tear, so I do hope they are renovating soon. Club lounge was excellent as was the staff there. The lounge provided a nice (hot) breakfast, lunch with two hot dishes and a spread of cold items, afternoon tea with pastries, evening snacks (again with two item items), and open bar in the afternoon/evening. I was very impressed with the overall quality, decor, and service of the lounge and it is a VERY good value. My biggest complaint was the lack of a full service health club facility for a hotel of this size. Exercise options included only a 24 hour room off of the lobby with some machines. Loved Frankfurt overall and felt very safe. Would definitely return again for a long weekend.

<Content>Another Great Stay At The IC My wife and I just left the IC after a three night stay. We got a great rate through Hotwire. We arrived by car. They let me leave the car in their front dirve while we checked in. Afterwards, I picked up my car to return it to the train station. It's a 10 minute walk from the IC to the train station. Never a problem, day or evening. It's a short walk from the IC to the river. Our room on the 19th floor had a city view. Nice bedding and linens. When we requested to have the linens changed due to allergies, it was done promptly. Breakfast each day was fine. Very leisurely and uncrowded. Free wireless hotspot in the lobby. Also two free computers with quick internet access in the business center in the main lobby.The concierge was very helpful along with the front desk and bell staff.We'll definitely stay at the IC upon our next visit to Frankfurt.

<Content>Fantastic Place to Stay! I have just returned from an excellent 2 night stay at the Intercontinental Frankfurt. The hotel, staff and location were absolutely perfect and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.We arrived early (10am) and, as expected, were told that our room was not yet ready but if we took a seat, they'd call housekeeping and ask them to get our room ready. As we were going out for the day, we told them to take their time and checked our luggage into the bag store without a problem.We had a twin standard room in the City Wing. This is the wing that people here seem to have been less impressed with but I found everything just perfect. Access to the City Wing is across the street to the main reception but there is a carpeted underpassage within the hotel so you can get from reception to your room without going outside! Our room was on the 19th floor and had a fantastic view of the city. No complaints - it was beautiful at night with all the lights. A different type of beautiful to the river view no doubt, but it was certainly not ugly.The room itself was comfortable and tastefully furnished. Not modern, but fine. The beds were very comfortable and there were two different types of pillow to choose from. Non-allergenic or down pillows were available on request.The bathroom was large and the shower was excellent. A robe and slippers were provided for each guest and there were plenty of towels and Elemeris toiletries which were high quality. There were also cotton wool balls, Q tips, a shower cap and sewing kit provided in the bathroom as well as a hairdryer and a magnifying mirror for shaving / make up.The room facilities were good - an electronic safe, kettle (which was the only bad feature - it didn't have a spout and was a nightmare to pour with), tea and coffee, minibar, TV, iron and trouser press and a shoe shine service where you could leave your shoes outside your room to be cleaned overnight (free of charge).Our rate included breakfast and this was amazing. As the hotel is full of business people from many countries, the breakfast buffet was very international and included Asian food, curry, cereal, toast, pastries, ham, cheese, cooked selections, juice, yogurt, fruit and so on. The biggest choice I've ever come across and beautifully presented.We dined at Leon's Italian restaurant (access via city wing) on both nights of our stay and again this was excellent. The food is very well priced (from 6 euro for a pizza, 9 euro for a pasta dish) and the staff were very attentive. The food was served very quickly. If you're thinking of dining there, it is worth making a reservation or getting there early as it was busy.Finally, the location was perfect for us. On arrival, we took the short walk from the station (Hauptbahnhof) - the hotel was easy to find and the short walk felt safe and away from the red light district that is to the other side of the station. Getting around was easy, if you didn't want to walk to the shopping areas, the subway (U-bahn) from the Hauptbahnhof was easy to get to and goes to the main areas of the city. We also took a walk by the nearby River Main which was very pleasant.

<Content>Excellent hotel in superb location for train travel I have just returned from a 10 day vacation in Germany. During that time I stayed in 7 different hotels in major cities throughout Germany, so I feel I have a good basis for comparison. My wife and I traveled mainly by train using the German twin rail pass. The IC Frankfurt is an excellent hotel that rates among the best of those that I stayed in. This is primarily a business hotel, so it has it wil not have any local color, but the staff and front desk would rank among the best in Germany. The rooms are nice and the location is very convenient. The hotel is easily reached by walking from the Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof and is away from the somewhat seedy area around the the train station. The views from the rooms are nice at night, even in the tower the faces the city. The city tower contains a very good Italian restaurant, as well. Frankfurt is primarily a business hub, and not an end tourist destination. We used our stay here, to adjust to the time change, do limited sight seeing ( I would recommend the Goethe House) and then start our extended train travels. The hotel is an excellent choice for other people who are planning to do the same thing.

<Content>Wonderful Club Level The hotel itself is nicely decorated, spacious, and clean.Upon check-in, they overlooked our Priority Club status and did not upgrade our room. Perhaps I could have made them more aware as I just joined. So speak up.The wonderful club concierge Gisela later appologized for this, it was not her oversight, and offered a double room upgrade the next visit. The junior club suite was nice and large, modern and not at all a small European closet style room. I loved the room. I had a city view and would have preferred the river view I could see in the club lounge.The best part of the stay was the Club Level. I booked on AAA at a better value. Anyway, the club lounge on the 21st floor has plenty of food all day, full breakfast, small lunch and then something new for dinner. You could just have your meals there if you chose to. Complimentary drinks and alcohol until about 10:30pm, and then they lock the booze and put away the hot food, but the other stuff is there.The club lounge view is pretty and the best part is the most wonderful woman you might ever meet, Sabariah. She is one of the club lounge attendants and one of the most kind, sophisticated and efficient people you will ever meet. I looked forward to the days she was working. She is truly the highlight of the Intercontinental Frankfurt and the city of Frankfurt in my opinion. I would promote her to the front of the house as she has the best people skills of anyone I have ever met while travelling. I would go back to Frankfurt just to see her. If I do have to go back to Frankfurt, I will see if she is still there, if not I will stay closer to shopping and what nightlife Frankfurt does have.The bartenders and waitresses at the Mainhatten Bar in the lobby are really nice, especially Julia. The staff and manager always had a quick smile and the live piano is nice too.The bar closes every night at 2 a.m. the sign says, except when it is slow and they decide to close earlier. Room service will deliver after hous to the bar area or go out a few blocks to a red light area bar if need be. The red light district is very close, however, it is more sad than scary.Leon's restaurant...food is good for a hotel...however, the waiters thought it would be funny to stamp on the bill service gratuity not included. So, I tipped 10 euros on a 40 euro bill. Later I learned that gratuity is included in all bills. The waiter was rude and upset that we did not order a nice steak as he kept offering. He wore a wooden bead bracelet with a cross, what a thing to do. So, he suckered me. When I asked the hotel concierge about whether or not tip was included they assured me it was. When I then told me it was their own restaurant of Leon's, they tried to backpedal and then asked if I had a copy of that bill and, sure it is wrong of Leon's to do, but if the service was really good, it wasn't and on and on. They handled it poorly and I was deliberately mislead. When I tried to call about it the hotel operator would not connect me to the restaurant at 3:15pm because they closed at 3pm and did not open until 5pm.A few bad apples did not spoil the visit.I was with someone on business and spent the most time at the hotel. Business people alone would like this place, however, if you are like me and the one going along for the trip, choose a hotel closer to the shopping area, where you don't have to walk down deserted yet seemingly safe streets to get to the Zeil. I passed the Steigenberger in that area.All in all, a nice place to stay for business, get club level and the added cost is negated with the included meals and beverages. Without the Club level I don't know what I would have done all day and night. It was a nice place to visit and enjoy the food and the view. If you are lucky, you will meet Sabariah!

<Content>A good business hotel This is a good hotel to stay in Frankfurt.It is not too far from the city centre (the main train station Hauptbahnhoff)...just about 200 meters, but still it is far detached from the sleazy red light area of the district.I have enjoyed my stays at the Inter Conti as the hotel is well equipped and they have fairly decent sized rooms as far as Frankfurt goes. The breakfast is great and the staff friendly.Overall if you can afford it and need a place close to the train station where most of the shops open till later in the evening, it is good place to stay!

<Content>awful I am currently staying at the hotel on business. As the employee of a large corporate customer of IC as well as a gold member of IC's loyalty programme, I assumed I'd get good treatment and the website showed nice rooms. However, despite asking for a river view room and being told one was available, I was given a room in the City wing which has a stunning view of.....the river wing. Oh, and a nice office block lit up in blue neon all night so you have to keep the curtains closed. The level of reflected noise from the street and the aircon units on the river wing's ground floor roof between the two hotel buidlings ensured that sleep was suitably disturbed. I have to admit, though, if you lean out of the 20th floor window (safe!) and look left, you can indeed see the river.The room is tiny, the bed is not king size (as specified for the corporate rate my firm is paying) and there are no decent news or sport channels (in any language, doesn't have to be English!). The kettle malfunctions so that when I made tea this morning I poured boiling water all over my bare feet - great start to the day. In addition, the shower hook doesn't allow for the shower to point into the bath so you have to hold it unless you want to huddle up against the taps and wall. In short, the room bears no relation to ANY displayed on the hotel's website, the bed has two single duvets which I loathe (and which is why I booked a king and not two singles in the first place), and I am checking out early and going somewhere else.I'm sure if you stay in the river wing, it's lovely - reception is certainly much nicer than the City wing - but don't expect IC Frankfurt to care about what you actually booked or whether you are a member of the IC loyalty scheme.

<Content>Business Hotel The Intercontinental Frankfurt is more a business hotel. I rented a suite on my one night visit to Frankfurt. The suite was of a good size (60 sqm+) and had a balcony. No problem with the room; the fit out was nothing fancy but tasteful; it came with a good desk for working.What I enjoyed most about my room was the view of Frankfurt; I was on one of the higher floors. At night, the view of the skyscrapers is incredible.I also had access to the Intercontinental Club Lounge. No complaints here; plenty of drinks on hand, and the staff did not put them away after a certain hour, as per some Intercontiental properties. I enjoyed a few whiskies in the Club lounge, but I was the only person in the lounge later in the evening; very quiet. It is however, a good place for entertaining your business guests.Overall, I have no complaints about this hotel; as upmarket business hotels go, this hotel is fine.

<Content>Nice, if you get a corner room This hotel has a great location within walking distance of the main train station (about a 15 minute walk) and the downtown area (another 10-15 minutes).I booked a superior room online and got upgraded to a deluxe corner room. I assume this was because I am a member of the Intercontinental's Ambassador program, although they didn't specifically say. The corner room (1601) was nice, with a view of the river as well as the downtown skyline. It was spacious, with a small sofa and sitting area, and it even included a balcony. Overall, I was pleased with the layout and furnishings.The one bad thing about the room was that the high-speed internet did not work. They had me call the iBahn helpline, which was useless and a waste of 30 minutes. Then they sent a technician, who fiddled with the wires for another 30 minutes and finally concluded that I needed to switch rooms. Finally, they took another 45 minutes to give me the key to another room (fortunately, it was another corner room -- 1401), where the internet was working. It was frustrating to lose a couple of hours on this process, and after all of that, they still charged me the regular rate of 18 euros to connect for one day of internet access. Throughout the process, the staff was courteous (and I was courteous to them, as well), but not once did they ever apologize for the inconvenience.Back to the positives: the gym is relatively large with a good range of equipment. The treadmills are a little old and sad looking, but they still work fairly well. The breakfast buffet is nice, with a lot of interesting choices (they even have a Japanese breakfast area, with miso soup).Overall, I was pleased with the experience, especially since I got a good room rate. If it hadn't been for the issue with the internet, it would have been a perfect stay.

<Content>Medium Hotel Good Morning, I've just returned from Frankfurt where I've been in work. My company booked Hotel at Intercontinental Frankfurt, wich by the name it would suppoded to be a good choice. I've found a regular hotel. Rooms too small for this type of Hotel and with noi confort at all. Breakfast was good by, as usual, too crowdy. In the morning we had to wait 5m or more for the elevator. IN general is a regular hotel with nothing in particular that make my stay special. Best Regards Carlos

<Content>Excellent Hotel - Friendly, Helpful Staff My husband booked this hotel for a weekend as he got me concert tickets for a birthday present. The concert was in Offenbach and as it was a special birthday, he wanted to take me to a special hotel. He couldn't have picked better really. The hotel is not too far away from the airport, a taxi cost around 鈧?0. We arrived at around 11.30am and I expected to have to wait until 2pm or 3pm before we could check in. However, the receptionist checked us in immediately and we were able to go straight into our room - I was extremely pleased and rather surprised by this. During our check-in we were given a map of the City and the receptionist pointed out the location of lots of attractions, shopping areas, etc and then called on the Concierge to come and give us information about the Tour Bus. The receptionist and Concierge couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. This was to be true of all of the staff that we saw during our stay. The hotel itself was stunning and we had a deluxe room in the river wing. Unfortunately we didn't get one of the rooms directly overlooking the river but we did at least have a glimpse of it and the building at the side of the hotel was lit up with blue neon lights at night which looked beautiful. In any case, we weren't really in our room long enough to really bother about a view as we spent the two days walking around the City and taking in the sights, etc. It was a great room though, very spacious, clean and extremely comfortable. We ate in Signatures on our first night and the food was superb. A very high standard and first class service too. We didn't go into Leons so I can't speak for that. Breakfast was great and lots of choice catering for all tastes. We didn't get to try the Sunday Brunch as we were still full from breakfast. The hotel is in an excellent location and we managed to find our way around quite easily. We took a nice stroll around the city on Saturday and browsed around the shops and then on the Sunday we decided to cross the river and take a look at that side before heading back across to find somewhere to sit and enjoy a nice warm glass of Apfelwein. If you do want to go further afield there are plenty of taxis at the front of the hotel and the tram and underground system is nearby. All in all, an excellent choice of hotels - especially if you're looking for something just a little bit special.

<Content>Quality hotel in convenient location The hotel has a convenient location with walking distance to thecity centre (Zeil) and shopping district (Goethestrasse). The building is next to the river and the top floor rooms have stunningviews over the city.The disappointed reviews mentioned here were most probablybased on the standard rooms. The hotel is very big withmany hundreds of rooms in two high-rise buildings andthe hallways of the lower floors seem worn. I always booked a Club Studio or a Club Suite and had agreat experience. There are only very few Club accomodationsso you will get a special service when booking one. The Studiosare very spacious one-room accomodations, with large baths,workdesk, large sitting area while the Club Suites occupy thecorners of the house, providing superb views, separatelivingroom, guest bathroom, TV in master bathroom, another 2 TV sets in livingroom and bedroom, large workdesk, small marble entrance foyer. The decor is a bit outdated but still luxurious. The Club Lounge is renovated, luxurious and very spacious, with all day complimentary food presentation as well ascomplimentary beverages including champagne andliquors all day. There is a PC for complimentary use inthe meeting room adjacent to the lounge and a smallterrace with tables to enjoy in warm days. There was once a pool in the hotel but they demolishedit for an unknown reason so now there is only a smallgym downstairs.Overall, the hotel is very good quality and value in aconvenient location and surely one of the best in the city.

<Content>Awesome! We got a great deal on this hotel through Hotwire and were so impressed with this place. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in, the room was spacious (although the bathroom was a bit small), and there were a lot of fun little extras, such as a bathroom mirror that didn't fog. We also were given a room with an amazing view of the river. Staff was friendly and efficient and the concierge couldn't have been more helpful with regard to restaurant recommendations and reservations. I felt like a rich businessman without having to spend a fortune.

<Content>Excellent Weekend I booked this hotel for a 'luxury weekend break' with some trepidation following reading the some of the previous reviews on this site. I was pleasantly surprised after booking at short notice I was greeted as a Intercontinental Amabassador (which You can buy for this chain of hotels and which I highly recommend at the price, especially at the current UK exchange rate). My wife and I were then escorted to what was described as a 'river view studio' on the 10th floor of the river wing which was beautiful and complete with complimentary fresh flowers, fruit and mineral water. The room had a balcony and overlooked the Rhine and the decor though a little dated was highly acceptable with Molten Brown toiletries which was highly pleasing to my wife.I can confirm that the buffet breakfast is very good and also restaurant Leon's as described elsewhere in these reviews.The staff and concierge were the epitomy of helpfulness and service and the room service food excellent. It couldn't have been better for the two of us and I recommend emailing prior to arrival to request a room in the river wing ( which is what I did).We walked locally both along the river and to the city shopping area and felt safe at all times. Maybe I was lucky but in any event I couldnt have had a much better long weekend.

<Content>Only the basics This is a very standard business hotel with no charm. You can find all the basics for a short stay (max. a couple of days of stay is recommended, not more). I stayed for one night at a room in the City Wing. The room and the bathroom were smallish and tired looking. The reception staff was unsmiling and unattentive, seemed very much bored with what they do. The Italian Restaurant downstairs is highly recommended, good food at a reasonable price.

<Content>No way! From Intercontinental I expected a lot more... Stayed there many times. The rooms are simple, no warm feeling, no English channel - except CNN (and who wants to watch that 24/7?), the toilet stinks, can't control the heat/AC, it's either hot or cold. The receptionists are rude, unfriendly, the concierge is even worst. The location is nice but don't think it's safe at night.

<Content>Pleasant enough One night in a corner suite. We were in the newer riverside building, although this is still an architectural horror story from the late 1960's / early 1970's. If you have a river view room then this is a pleasant place to stay, with lovely views and very easy access - the best of any city centre hotel - to the various museums on the opposite bank. Even the main business district is only a 10 minute walk.Staff were very friendly and helpful. My biggest gripe was with the decoration. Whilst refurbished in the last five years or so, it was not a great job - I could see the old wallpaper at the edges in some places, and the interior doors seem to be 25 year old originals. The decor is also typical four-star business hotel style - very uninspiring. That said, the other 'city' wing of the hotel looked a lot worse from the outside and you should certainly try to ensure you have a river wing room, even if it on the side facing the street. (Unfortunately, there is no way of booking this on the website.)The breakfast buffet was quite impressive, but ruined when I tried to order a pancake (which you are encouraged to do). The first time they forgot, the second time they offered to bring it to my table but left it sitting by the buffet. When I finally retrieved it and cut it open, uncooked pancake mixture flooded out of the middle - it was seriously undercooked. Luckily for us the hotel forgot to charge us for breakfast.All in all, pleasant enough, especially in a river view room or suite, but uninspiring. There is a new Radisson SAS opening in November 2005 which looks impressive and may be worth checking out.

<Content>Great hotel While I only stayed at this hotel for one night while traveling through Frankfurt, I thought it was great. What a beautiful view of the Rhine from my room too! The room was not particulary large but very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful and there was an excellent breakfast buffet in the Signatures Veranda restaurant. For dinner we walked across the street to a second building that is part of the hotel and ate at a restaurant the hotel offers there called Leon's. It was an Italian restaurant which had absolutely delicious food and terrific service! Another plus for this hotel was their business center. The hotel is within walking distance of a pathway along the river where you could stroll to the historic Roemer district as well as many other sites.
