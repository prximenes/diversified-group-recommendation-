<Content>Not very clean I have just returned from a five night stay in the hotel. Arrived early and left my luggage at reception. They do have a room for storing luggage and this is where my case was kept.The room itself was ok but the area around the bath had mold growing on it. I pointed this out to both the reception and the cleaning staff. Nothing happened. On the third day I tackled them again about the problem . Explanation given was the cleaning staff are Chinese and do not speak either English or German so they could not guarantee the problem could be resolved.I insisted on changing rooms and was eventually given a room on the executive floor.That room was much larger but with worn and dirty carpet.The breakfast buffet is adequate .The internet access is like a small telephone box with no seat.Location is quiet but the U bahn station is not on a main line and you have to change trains twice to get to Zoo Station which has connections to most places and the 100  200 buses stop there. It is 20 minutes walk to the hotel from there or 5 minutes by cab. Cost 5euro. Hasir restaurant on the corner of the street is very good.

<Content>Worst hotel ever. Smells bad. A very bad hotel. To avoid. First, the location. It's not that good for the center attractions and not well connected to public transports. Second, the staff. Very arrogant, not helpful at all.Finally the room. Kind of small, bad furnished and without any air-conditioning. I have stayed 7 nights and they just changed the sheets once and I think they never changed the towels.I have to refer to the most disgusting thing in this hotel. The bathroom have a open sewer of a kind, next to the bathtub that exhales the most noxious odor. And this was true in my bedroom and also in the other bedrooms of the hotel where fellow Portuguese travelers stayed.I most warn everybody to avoid this hotel.They haven鈥檛 no English instructions for the phone, they don鈥檛 have a proper luggage deposit, our luggage just stayed in the lobby and anyone can open it or take it. (We tried the last part and they didn鈥檛 care)

<Content>Worst hotel experience in recent memory I had to attend Berlin at rather short notice to attend a large conferenece of lawyers: INTA. All the good hotels in town were completely booked out which left me the Alsterhof as my only option. I arrived about 10 am and was told my room wasn't ready. No apology from the staff just a statement that it would be ready at 1 maybe 2. Surly staff behind front desk but very nice fellow who acted as doorman during the day. No air-conditioning, characterless rooms althought they were clean. My mini bar was locked and it took 12 hours to get a key to it. Depressing and not to be recommended.

<Content>Highly recommended Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. Here are my impressions:Pros:- extremely clean rooms- quite spacious rooms- rooms include all necessary features (safe, TV, hair-drier etc.)- located within walking distance to main shopping area (5 min. to KaDeWe, 10 min. to Ku-damm)- located very near to U-Bahn (Metro) station (called after the street's name Augsburger, 1 min. walking from hotel), so it's easy to get to any point in the city through the public transportation (hotel reception also sell one-way tickets and day tickets to the public transportation at the same price as at the machines in the stations)- helpful english-speaking staff- very good choice at breakfast (cereals, eggs, bacon, cheese, ham, jams, croissant, juices, coffee and tea and more).- located on a quiet street which means no car/train noise at night.Cons:- quite distant from main attractions in the east side of the city, though it's easy to get there with the public transportation.- U-bahn line that runs near the hotel is relatively uncentral (but you can change trains as much as you want so it's not a big issue).- No air condition (only heating that works whenever the hotel wants)- equipment in the room (telephone, heating) has German instructions on it, no english.Overall: Would highly recommend it to anyone. You won't be disappointed.

<Content>Better than I expected! I arrived in Berlin via train from Kracow on the East side of town. I continued onward and got off at the Zoologischer Garten station and walked to the Alsterhof. It was a decent shuffle through Europa Center and I did know that there was a connecting U bahn- U9 I believe- but it is a worthwhile trip to get a glimpse of things.The staff at the Alsterhof allowed me an early check in since the room had been cleaned and were more than accomodating. I think I would have to agree with the positive statements thus far and I would be hard pressed to find a fault with my stay there.As far as location there is great shopping nearby and tons of things going on at the Zoo. I made great use of the internet cafe at the Dunkin Donuts near the station, which conveniently was also the place where I met up with an Insider Tour group.

<Content>Great Hotel and Excellent Location Stayed at this hotel for 8 nights. Not being to Berlin before we werenot sure about the area, but found that it is located in an excellentpart of the city. Right behind the KaDaWe and within walking distanceto two major rail stations. English speaking staff and the room is the biggest we have stayed in when visiting any country Europe..in fact it is the size of a standard American hotel room. Great breakfast, which was not included in our cheap price, but it was only10 euro which is a good bargin. Excellent hotel!!! Will stay there again!

<Content>Clean hotel, polite staff, nice position On arrival in Berlin we were amazed at how easy it was to get a bus to the Berlin Zoo which is walking distance from this hotel. The ticket machines are easy to use too, touch the screen and then choose English. The airport is in Zone B, but literally everywhere else we went in Berlin (including our hotel) was in Zone A so the tickets were easy to buy as it was the same one every time. We bought single tickets on each journey but I would suggest you buy a travel card (tagaskarte) which are on sale at the ticket office. There are no ticket barriers at any of the stations and I didnt see a single inspector in the 4 days I spent there but if you do get caught you will be charged 40 euros so better to be safe than be sorry. The hotel staff are polite and the room is clean and the bed was so comfy I didnt want to get up! I would suggest you learn some basic German before you arrive because the German people will be so much nicer to you if you at least TRY to speak German. We visited Checkpoint Charlie (very small so try to get there early before it gets busy), Topographie des Terrors (is outside and is all in German unless you buy the audio guide, but is also right next to the largest standing part of the Berlin Wall), The Story of Berlin (only really worth a visit for the tour down to the nuclear shelter), The Siegessaule (a walk through the park on the way is relaxing), The Reichstag (the queue was too long and didnt appear to be moving so we didnt go inside), Zoologischer Garten (fabulous day out, especially if you have children), The film museum (for fans of German film only), Fernsehturm (enjoy a drink in the bar at the top if you dont suffer from vertigo!), and of course The Brandenburg Gate (a passing glance was enough, but a sit outside the coffee shop to watch the crowds go by is even better). We were sight seeing from 10am till closing time every day and we still didnt see everything we wanted to. In the evenings we ate in local German restaurants that were recommended in the Time Out guide but the best meal we had was in Henne in Leuschnerdamm 25. The only thing on the menu is half a milk roasted chicken and you can choose between potato or cabbage salad (although we had both and shared) but it was the most delicious chicken I have ever tasted. Crispy on the outside, moist and succulent on the inside. The waitresses were lovely, and especially friendly when we tried to talk German to them and it was jam packed full of Germans. I would definately recommend this hotel as it is clean, comfortable and the staff are friendly. It is opposite a tube station and the tube service is just as easy to use as the London service but its cleaner and more regular.

<Content>Excellent value Stayed at this hotel with my partner. I thought it was very good value for money and also very central. Checking-in staff very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was excellent and unlike some hotels, they kept replenishing the food right up to the last minute. I would return to this hotel and would recommend it.

<Content>Very good clean hotel Hi I stayed at this hotel because of its central position, I found the hotel to be ideal for me. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the maid service is excellent. The hotel bar is very small but there are plenty of bars nearby, the food was very good but pricey but again found plenty of places to eat nearby.Overall this is a very good reasonably priced hotel in a good position to explore Berlin.

<Content>We were only there for the bier! Visited Berlin and stayed at the Alsterhof last weekend with a party of twelve celebrating the impending marriage of one of our number. Overall a good location for transport around the city, and a great one if you like shopping (not something we did a great deal of unless beer counts).Rooms and public areas are clean and smart enough. My single room on the fifth floor wasn't big and was very warm (I had the window open constantly for three days)Didn't eat in the Hotel, but can recommend the Cafe am neuen See in Tiergarten if you fancy a half hour stroll before breakfast.Hindsight also suggests that from this end of the city, get German Transfer or a taxi to Schonefeld rather than the S-bahn. The train took ages and goes through some of the less glamorous part of the city on the way to the airport station, where you have to walk the last half mile to the teminal!Overall, thank you Alsterhof Hotel, German Transfer and the people of Berlin for an enjoyable weekend.

Service is very good, rooms are spacious and the front desk staff is extremely helpful. There is free Internet access in the lobby. There are a number of good restaurants in the area and the Turkish restaurant next door is quite good and prices are very reasonable.Denver MullicanNew Orleans

<Content>good quality hotel got a great deal on this hotel for a 3 night stay 13-15 feb through expedia and my wife and i were very happy with our stay in this hotel. a ten minute walk takes you to the zoo gardens where you can catch transport to anywhere you want, staff in the hotel were all excellent and a minor fault with the room safe was quickly rectified. we did not eat in the hotel as it was a bit pricey but their were loads of options close by. we ate twice in a little spanish run restaurant torre negro which is located 100 metres from the hotel 1st left after you turn left out of the hotel. food was excellent and more than reasonably priced and the staff were friendly and attentive. rooms were what we would expect from a hotel of this rating. if you want to see the sites of berlin then i would recommend the free walking tour run by [--], the tour guide was fantastic and you just tip what you think is reasonable, its better than the bus tours and more imformative. after doing this tour use the 100 and 200 bus service which you can catch at the zoo gardens to go and see the places which interest you most.

<Content>Good deal for a basic modern hotel This is a basic, modern, no frills hotel. I just got back from a week stay there. The rooms are very clean and functional and the staff were pleasant and helpful. I have no real complaints except that the inroom safe had to be paid for on a daily basis which was a little odd (maybe its a German hotel thing)I got a great winter deal on the room but be aware the buffet breakfast (which is very good) is not included in the price and is Very expensive (16 Euros p/p). I would advise getting an inclusive deal or eating at one of the many local cafes which offered breakfast for a third of the price.Getting around Berlin is easy with public transportation very close by and the hotel is close to the more interesting neighborhoods of Schoneberg and Kreuzberg (maps are deceptive these areas are easily in safe walking distance of the hotel even though they appeared to be further away)Overall this hotel is fine for a basic safe modern hotel but don't expect much in the way of character.

<Content>Great location, excellent value Located in a great quietish location within a few minutes walk from KaDeWe, Zoogarden and very close to U-Bahn (Augsberger Strs).The room was a nice size, only complaint would be that beds were very soft and room was warm (no aircon). Additional facilities looked good with a cosy bar and well equipped fitness centre.Many restaurants and bars are within walking distance. I'd thoroughly recommend Hasir which is 100 metres away - excellent and plentiful Turkish food.Given the price we paid a good value hotel suitable for business travellers, family and couples.

<Content>Wonderful location Just returned from a 2 night stay. Alsterhof is in a great location within a tidy and quiet neighbourhood. Just a few minutes walk from KaDeWe, Europa centre and Zoogarden. Room was great, clean and spacious. Staff were polite, very helpful and knowledgeable of the surrounding area. Breakfast was plentiful, buffet style with lots to choose from. Delicious! Also, there is a nice little bakery across the street and quiet coffee house just around the corner. Many restaurants and bars are within walking (or staggering) distance and the U-Bahn station Augsburger Strasse is right outside the hotel. Fantastic location for venturing into the city or to the airports if needs be. All in all a great stay, thanks Alsterhof.

<Content>A Hard Review To Write Stayed for 3 nights and have mixed feelings about this hotel.I booked a single room - big mistake. It was no bigger than a matchbox and didn't even have a wardrobe, just a small rail that pulled out from the end of the bed, which was set against a wall. The bed was quite high and the draws for clothes were below the mattress. So no closet, no chest of draws and a room the size of a phonebox. I complained but was told nothing doing, hotel was full and I got what I'd paid for, a single room.Breakfast was adequate, but the worst I've had in all my trips to Berlin. It had all the usual, egg, bacon, cheeses etc but no smoked salmon and was not great for a 4 star hotel. It done its job but didn't make you want to refill your plate a second time.It wasn't all bad though. The actual hotel is very nice and has a quite expensive feel about it and as mentioned by others the location is superb. I always try to stay near the Kudamm, and this is on a quite street just behind the KaDeWe. I couldn't have wished for a better spot. A supermarket and some very nice restaurants a 2 min walk away with Zoo station a 10 min stroll.The staff were very friendly and helpful apart form one (there's always one!) but this was the guy I complained to so we probably got off on the wrong footing. The rest were fine and pleasant.Would I stay again? If the price was right and only in a double room. I would trade the breakfast off for the location which again is excellent.

<Content>Excellent location My husband and I stayed at the Alsterhof and it has to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in. We booked it through a last minute deal and didn't really know what to expect but as we were only there for 3 nights and got it cheap we didn't care. The rooms were spotless, a good size and cleaned daily. The staff were helpful and polite and the location couldn't have been better. Just off Kurfurstendam it was really close to shops, restaurants, buses and the train station. We will definitely be back. Can't wait!

<Content>Very disappointing stay I have written a previous review on the Alsterhof and having stayed there again, I thought I should share my experiences with readers on this site. The mark of a good hotel is its ability to deal with the unexpected and its ability to make guests feel at home. On both counts the Alsterhof let me down. When I arrived there was no water for a few hours due to construction work. I was told nothing about this at check-in and only discovered that this was the case when I tried to take a shower. On calling the reception desk there was no apology or alternative offer given. Indeed, what irked the most was that the room was full of overpriced bottles of mineral water that they could have offered to guests during this time to use. Fortunately, I didn't have to wait long. The other thing is that the inroom wifi is outrageously priced at EUR9 for 2 hours. The receptionist told me that I could use the PCs in reception for free. The main difficulty with that is that all the files that I have on my laptop that I need to be able to send to my office can't be transferred to the PCs in Reception. The hotel is OK for leisure travellers but not particularly useful for business travellers. Finally, on my last day when I took breakfast I was treated to a very loud conversation about me by the waiters in the restaurant and the fact that I had checked-out and hadn't paid for breakfast. It wasn't true but it was quite embarrassing and really did not inspire confidence. There was no apology from them for the mistake or the inconvenience. In fact, given that and the fact that you basically have to pay for everything in the hotel, including essentials like shampoo, gives the impression that every penny counts and making the guest feel at home comes last.

<Content>Great location We stayed here for 3 nights. Our room was very nice. Double bed plus a futon couch. The room was located in the rounded portion section of the hotel. My mother on the other hand had a room that was the size of a walk in closet. You weren't able to walk around the bed, there wasn't enough room.The breakfast is wonderful, everything you can imagine.It is located only 2 blocks from KaDeWe, a taxi line, the subway, and the sightseeing bus. There is also a terrific turkish restaurant 2 blocks away,

<Content>Excellent hotel - fantastic location!! I stayed at the Alsterhof for 3 nights in late November this year after booking a cheap deal on lastminute.The location is superb, situated in the centre down a quieter road just off of all the main shopping streets.Its a 5/10 minute walk from the Zoo and the central station. There is also a metro station just down the road from the hotel entrance.There are lots of restaurants and bars nearby which offer a great selection of food for every taste.The hotel room was a good size and very clean. The beds were very comfy and the bathroom had a good powerful shower.We were overlooking the beer garden, and found the location great as it was very quiet and we never had any noise from outside or from other guests.The breakfast was vast and had a wide choice to choose from - enough to keep you going all day!Staff were very helpful and spoke perfect English. They were always very friendly and cheerful towards us.I would recommend the Alsterhof to anyone wanting to stay in Berlin, it was excellent value for money and in a perfect location to explore the city. I would definantly return!

<Content>Great Location, English Speaking, Great Value! We stayed at The Hotel Alsterhof between the 4th and 6th December, and spent the weekend in Berlin. It was fantastic. The Hotel was very good. Great great location, within walking distance of great shopping, xmas markets, the zoo, the main train station etc... and there is a U bahn station just outside the doorstep. When we checked in, there were candles all round the reception, they advised us that the hotel had no power between 1-6pm. We were out most of the afternoon anyway so it wasnt too much bother. When we returned however we were promised candles in our room by one receptionist and then it was not fulfilled. They didnt really know what to offer as light. They said we werent allowed candles. Im guessing because of fire or smoke risk however we were in a smoking room!? Anyway they eventually found us a flashlight that we had to use for an hour. The reception staff are fairly helpful, however do speak very good english. Our room was a lovely size, it was a double room, however two twin beds pushed together, however it didnt bother me. The bathroom was a nice size as well, with lovely bath and powerful shower. Everywhere was so clean and tidy. Just one tip for English people, the hotel does not have tea and coffee making facilities in the room and they also dont have english tea. closest you'll get is scented tea.As for breakfast, it was delightful. Lots of choice, we went down late both days so it was very busy so I would advise to go down earlier. On offer was Tea, coffee, fruit juices, Cereals, Bread and Rolls, Croissants, Pastries, Fruit Salad, Yoghurts, Dried Fruit, and Hot food including bacon, scrambled eggs, minced meat balls, boiled eggs, baked beans, and potatos. And to finish pancakes with maple syrup yum yum! You cant go far wrong with a breakfast like that to start the day.As for the evening the restaurant we found wasnt very popular with guests. It was very expensive in relation to some of the other eating places around but I guess it is a four star hotel. there was only 4 other people in the restaurant when we went in, so no atmosphere. If you want a great meal for next to nothing money, just turn out of the hotel and turn right. At the traffic lights turn right again and on the right hand side there is a restaurant called Toro Negro. Very busy, all candle lit, great atmosphere, great music. Its a spanish run place but they do all sorts of food. Pizza, pasta, mexican, tapas, Salads etc... We had Camebert, Large Rump Steak with Chips, Mozzerella and Herb pizza, 2 fantas, Crepes with icecream, 2 beers, and 1 wine and it came to 34 Euros! How cheap is that? The waitresses speak fairly good english as well. So overall the hotel was very good for what we paid for it, other than the electricity problem, we had a great time, and I would throughly recommend a stay in Berlin and a stay in this Hotel!

<Content>Excellent value I'd recommend the Alsterhof - a short walk to Ku/damm but on a quiet street. Room was perfectly comfortable and spotlessly clean. Excellent choice for breakfast but cooked items were cold. Reception staff spoke good english and were very helpful, even offered the hotel mini bus to drive us to the airport instead of waiting for a taxi. All in all fantastic value, would stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great location We have just returned from a week in Berlin at the Alsterhof Hotel.The service was surperb. Always willing to help and gave excellent advise.On arrival asked if wanted smoking or non smoking room and were given the floor of non smokers. The rooms are very clean and the double bedroom is of average size and quite comfortable. The bathroom is quaint but suitable for our needs with a bath and all the necessary requirements. Their breakfasts are one of the better we have ever had in a 4 star hotel in Europe and kept us going the whole day till the evening.The location of the hotel is definitely a fanastic advantage.Perfectly located with a 5 minute walk from the centre of Berlin in both directions and has excellent resturants in the close by vicinity.The lobby and internet service were of the highest qualities and is definitely a 4 star hotel. I would definitely return to stay when I visit Berlin again.

<Content>Great Reception Staff Just arrived back in UK from 4 nights at the Alsterhof. We chose this hotel over the internet. It proved to be a great choice - very central and we spent 2 days walking in the local area, soaking up the history. Rooms not overlarge but perfectly adequate. Wonderful German duvets, so cosy. Very easy to use nearby underground when we wanted. Hotel reception staff were excellent. All quite young - quiet but unobtrusive and very efficient. A problem with our safe was dealt with quickly and effectively. On our last morning the reception staff arranged for us to have breakfast before 6.00 as we needed to be away early for our flight. The taxi we ordered arrived reassuringly early. First time we have booked direct with Internet and no problems at all. Also made good use of the free internet access. Thanks Alsterhof staff, we had a great time.

<Content>Very basic 2.5 star hotel by american standards Best point for the hotel is location which is fantastic. 2 blocks from gay schoenberg area, a block from KaDeWe department store. But it is definitely NOT a four star hotel as they rate themselves. No air conditioning, no amenities in bathroom except the towells and a soap pump. Just a decent clean room with not so great bedding. Very average. But I got it on priceline for $65.00 US so for that price it is a value. But I wouldn't pay more than that because this hotel is nothing special.

<Content>Just okay at the Alsterhof Location is fine, place is clean, and no problems with the bathroom, but oh that postage-stamp bed for two ... and when we asked the next day to be moved to a room with either twins or a decent-sized bed, we were told that the hotel was full up. I'm ambivalent about staying here again. I got a much better deal at the Marriott Potsdamer Platz on a previous trip. Sure, the Alsterhof is in a great location, but I liked the nice big king-sized bed at the Marriott, and both are convenient to Berlin's extensive public transport. If I ever book the Alsterhof again, I'll be sure to ask for a decent bed!

<Content>Very helpful staff The front-desk staff here bend over backwards to help, even though some of them aren't fluent speakers of English (better than my German though).For example, in my travel-addeled state on arrival in Berlin I left my rucksack on the shuttle bus from the airport to the train station. My rucksack had my car and house keys in it, so you can imagine I was anxious to get it back. I had the telephone number of the central BVG lost property office (030/19 44 9 in case you ever need it), but on trying it I got someone who spoke no English. I asked at hotel reception if someone could ring on my behalf, which they did and translated a description of my rucksack to BVG Lost Property. Amazingly my rucksack was there. Wunderbar!We were staying in Berlin in the middle of a heatwave. Our room wasn't air-conditioned and it was sweltering at night, but if we opened the window for some fresh air at night, we had the noise from the hotel's biergarten below keeping us awake until 3am. Then a chance for a few winks before the bird's dawn chorus started up at about 4am. Not condusive to a good night's sleep, so we asked on Reception and they provided us with an electric fan. Thank you very much: sleep at last!One last point; if you are vegetarians like us, watch out for meat snuck into unlikely things at breakfast - there were pieces of bacon hidden in the baked beans and in the fried potatoes for example.

<Content>First timers to Germany strike it lucky! This hotel was definitely worth every penny we paid. The staff were plentiful and polite, the rooms clean and professional and the location was perfect. As a general guide the hotel is situated 1 block away from one of the main shopping centers of Berlin. Everything from the zoo to bars were within meters of the Alsterof, not that this mattered as the underground in Berlin is so extensive that every street corner seemed to has access. The breakfast was your usual choice of fruits, juices and grills and the bar is relaxing but a little pricey. Internet access in the foyer was free and 24 hours. Despite going in the middle of many snow storms the rooms were so cosy it was quiet a shock stepping back outside!Can highly recommend trying the small and local bars that appear randomly in the surrounding area. Most we tried came from a leaflet available in the foyer called Insomnia, which if followed leads you to some character rich venues, all of which seem to have love for strange cocktails and low lighting. Very European!Would definitely return to the Alsterhof when next in Berlin.

<Content>A Few Tips! My boyfriend and I spent two nights here in mid June 2005. My first big tip for you is if you are a non-smoker, when checking in make sure you request a non-smoking room, even if you have done so in your booking. We were given a smoking room and the smell was pretty bad. Apart from that, the bed was very small, barely a double size, and the bathroom was miniscule. Second tip - they don't provide any toiletries (shampoo/soap/conditioner) so a good idea to take your own. But the room was clean, there was no noise from any other room or outside and there was a fan in the room although it wasn't hot enough to use it! With the windows open there was a fair amount of street noise although it was quite cool so we kept them shut. Breakfast was fantastic, hot and cold buffet with everything you could want. The pancakes are great, like real American pancakes, not French crepes!! Berlin is an amazing city, and now tops my list of favourites! We recommend catching a train out to Savignyplatz and eating at the Zillemarkt restaurant there - the meals are massive, and scurmptious, and cheap!! A true German experience with sausages, schnitzels and lots of meat and veg dishes.

<Content>TOP but HOT Hotel! An average hotel that should be classed as a good 3*, We would recomend the hotel for the cold winter months but without air conditioning the rooms were like saunas during our stay.Good Points: Very close to Ausberger Strasse U Bahn, although this is a minor line so you do have to make lots of changes, but these are quick and simple!Free internet point in reception (if you can grab a free computer)Very clean standard room, but no freebies in the bathroom!Cocktail bar small but nice, staff friendly in here but not as helpful on reception.Good retaurants around the corner, central location in which to explore this fab city!

<Content>Excellent location and good clean hotel Stayed at the Alsterhof for three nights in December 2004 - couldn't have been a better location - about ten minute walk to Zoo station and only a couple of minutes from the Ku'damm. What we really appreciated was that it was in a very quiet street and desite it being a busy city there was very little noise at night. Breakfasts were excellent with a wide choice of hot and cold food. Only one very minor complaint - the bathroom was quite small - but, hey, who goes to Berlin to spend time in the bathroom! Definitely recommended, especially if you can get a good deal as prices seem to vary quite considerably, presumably depending on demand and the time of year.

<Content>great hotel, good location We stayed in the Alsterhof in March. The hotel is well equipped, clean and friendly. The front desk staff were always helpful and knowledgeable and spoke good English. The breakfast selection was vast and would please all tastes.Located a stones throw from a metro station and one block behind the famous Ku'Damm in a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle.I would definitely recommend this hotel. Check out last minute web site for some fantastic out of season hotel rates.
