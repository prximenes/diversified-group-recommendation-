<Content>Lovely hotel for anyone I just got back from staying at the Jayakarta for the third time.I was a bit worried before I was going after reading some of the reviews on here, but I had absolutely nothing to be worried about.When we arrived we were greeted with the free welcome drinks (just a small juice) and the check-in process was very speedy and there was no problems such as the room not being ready.We were shown to our room which was in the Residence block and was a one bedroom apartment (room 6503). Unfortunately, the air conditioner in this room was stuck on 27 degrees and we called maintenance and they didn't know how to fix it. We just put up with it for that night (most uncomfortable night of my entire life!) and the next morning my friend had a shower and the water leaked all over the bathroom floor and the TV would not work.After a wonderful breakfast (I will talk about them later) we went to the lobby and spoke to a lovely lady about our room and had no hesitation in offering us another apartment, but we asked if we could just have one of the normal hotel rooms overlooking the pool and beach. She was very apologetic in explaining that we couldn't be refunded for any money but that was fine by us, we loved our new room and location (room 294)!The beds there are definitely the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in and I would buy one for myself if I could. What we found annoying was that in the lobby one of the transport people (there is like a transport desk or something) kept hassling us while we were waiting for a taxi and did not seem to listen when we said that we already had everything booked (not true but he didn't need to know that ;) ).The breakfasts very lovelyyy! Unfortunately I was sick for most of the holiday with a cold so I had no appetite but what I did have was delicious! They have a large amount of small cakes and breads for breakfast as well as the hot food.The staff are always very helpful and friendly (the men moreso than women however). The room was usually cleaned by about 10am so there was no worrying about coming home in the afternoon and finding that the room hadn't been cleaned yet.When we were checking out they told us that we had used 155,000RP on the mini bar in the first room (the one we were only in for a night) consisting of about 2 beers and 4 cans of soft drinks. We told them that we hadn't used these and then the lady asked if we drink and we told her not from a mini bar and she wiped the charges :)The Jayakarta is a great hotel for anyone. It certainly isn't as good as a 5 star hotel but it is cheap and has everything that you could need.

<Content>Very happy Our Family of five stayed at the Jayakrta Residence in a two bedroom apartment from September 22 for 15 nights.Myself husband, 16 and 17 year old daughters and boyfriend. The facility offered acceptable comfortable accomodation, staff and service could not be faulted, breakfasts were of excellent quality and good variety. The grounds are well maintined and pools terrific. The Jayakarta is well located, friendly and affordable, we all enjoyed our stay and could recommend it to any one.

<Content>Oldiest I been travelling to bali for 3times and this is the worst hotel that i ever stay before. I stayed at Jayakarta for one night and i booked through the local travel agent. I expect to be a nice hotel since it's a 5 Star hotel.I booked the deluxe garden view room and upon check in i found that the was very old and there is a kind of smell inside the room. The room was dusty and the worst part is i got the room with a connecting door.I went down to the reception to ask for a room without the connecting door and the answer that they give me was all our deluxe room with connecting door. I been staying for so many hotel and i don't think so all the room have connecting door.Finally they upgrade us to the better woom which is facing the swimming pool.Other than the room everything was fine. Jayakarta hotel have a very good location. Nearby to beach and eatery. Swimming pool was nice and breakfast was no bad.Please consider twice if u want to book for this hotel.

<Content>Loved It! When we arrived at the airport our driver was there waiting for us we had him organised by the Jayakarta he told us a little bit about Bali and some of the activities we could do. When we arrived the workers outside the hotel came and opened the doors for us. We got froms next to our familys luckily because the hotel was nearly booked out. We went to regerstration and asked for our key but the room wasn't ready we were transfered to another part of the hotel our rooms were very shabby and in our friends room the air-conditioning didnt work one leaked and the other didnt turn on. As we were staying the hotel for two weeks we could not stand the rooms and as promised we were changes as soon as possible. We got 4 rooms as there was two familys on our holiday we got 2 joining next to each other and 2 near each other on the other side of the hotel which over looked the pool they were very nice and I would recomend asking for the rooms from 216 - 252. Every morning there was a buffet breakfast there was a wide choice to choose from but after 2 weeks we had tried everything because they had the same thing everyday. The pools were amazing and looked beautiful they were a bit warm but that cant be helped the deep plunge pool was a bit of a disapointment because you could hardly plunge into it was only about half a metre deep, the infinity pool was great and we ha fun lying around the pool on the day beds. The sunset bar is nice to sit and have a coke and just outside the hotel is legian beach. The culture night was nice with all of the balinesse dancers. If you ever stay at the Jayakarta Hotel the best resturant close to the hotel is the Zanibar just outside the hotel infront of legian beach. I would highly recomend staying at the Jayakata Hotel and I would definitly stay ther again

<Content>Great location We stayed at this hotel for a week, it was a last minute trip so we had to take what we could get. Before leaving I did check for reviews must admit having read some of them I wasn't expecting much. However I'm pleased to say that overall this hotel is OK, I'd say it caters mainly for families with young children. Its a 3 star hotel so obviously doesn't have the same spit and polish some of the more expensive hotels do.When we arrived we were given a standard room opposite a building site (that started hammering at 7am in the morning) with twin beds. I complained and was promised a double room the next day and as promised they moved us to a deluxe room nearer the pool which was much nicer.Having said that we didn't spend any time around the pool, the main reason was there were very few sun loungers and as previous reviews have said they were reserved by 7am. Nor were there many umbrella's and I heard a few people complain they had no shade.We spent our time in the sun on the beach, which is maybe another 100 yards walk out the hotel gate, across the walkway and straight onto the beach. We were near enough we could easily nip back to our room if we needed to. Two sun loungers all day for 50,000rhp, very peaceful and a much better view than round the pool. We didn't find the beach hawers a problem either.I agree the rooms do need an upgrade, although the staff clean them well each day they're rundown. But I also think this is reflected in their room rates which are pretty reasonable. Breakfast was average, having stayed in Bali many times this seems to be what you get if breakfast is included in the price. its a buffet style (with egg station that will serve eggs however you want including boiled) so theres plenty of choice and you can eat as much as you like. All the staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you if you asked them for anything.Would I stay here again? If I was after a cheap holiday on the beach (if you're a surfer its a great location) yes I would.

<Content>Very Disappointed I was extremely disappointed with this stay at the Jayakarta. My fifth stay in fact and definitely my last. I lasted 8 days of the 11 booked and wished I could have changed hotels sooner but everything was fully booked as Bali is really busy again.The grounds and pool area of the hotel are probably one of the best in bali but the rooms are in need of an upgrade.I had no problems with cleanliness or bed bugs (reading other reviews) but the fact that the hotel ran out of beach towels 3 days running, the fact that people hogged sun lounges all day with no policing from hotel staff bug the hell out of me. In 8 days my partner and I did not score a sun lounge once. People were obviously leaving their towels on the lounges from 7am (or even earlier) and leaving them all day. On my last day obviously after others had complained a sign was erected at the towel counter that towels left unattended on sun lounges for an hour would be collected.The breakfasts were pretty basic at the hotel and I ate down the road at Tekor Bali everyday which is a fantastic beachside eatery.But my main complaint was the unfortunate attraction of the yobby, noisey, heavy drinking guests to the hotel. Security was called on two nights with screaming fights and the final straw for me to leave was a group of boys staying in the room next door to me playing somekind of ball sport on the walls.I am not against anyone drinking and getting a bit merry but this crowd was over the top.My partner and I managed to get a room at the Bali Niksoma which is almost next door to the Jayakarta and it was like a oasis in comparison to our time at the Jayakarta.I think the staff at the Jayakarta have to get tougher with problem guests and we heard many similar complaints from others staying there who were wishing to move.Susan AtkinsSydney Australia

<Content>Loved every minute of our stay Our family of 4 stayed at Jaya for 14 nights in March 2008. Although we asked to change rooms upon arrival we had a fabulous stay. The rooms were clean and basic, but mostly you only sleep there. The first 2 rooms were smoky but what can you do when people smoke in them. They changed us no hassle. If you are a fussy person don't stay here as it is basic. You need to remember you are in a 3rd world country and what is star rated to us is different to them. After all look at the prices you are paying and what you would get in Australia for the same. I think you would get a cardboard box. I have been to Bali 7 times and stayed in different hotels each time and every one of these had their faults. If you don't like bugs get a can of insect repellent. After all its what you make of your holiday. Enjoy we did. Mandie

<Content>Nice Gardens and Pool鈥? I wish we had paid more to stay somewhere else. This hotel has a great pool and garden area with an OK buffet breakfast but the standard rooms really let it down. There were lizards running around in our room, there are no lifts so if you are on a high floor get ready to walk up a lot of steps. The bathroom is small and the toilet overflowed one night and I got up to find out what the dripping was and the floor was saturated. When I checked out I had heard this had happened to 2 other rooms. They have this strange cupboard next to the shower that is pretty much just a door to the backside of the plumbing. Other people we know who stayed there had little visitors (mouse/rats) in their rooms. Two of our family in different rooms had to be moved because one room had a musty smell and the other was adjacent to a building site that started at 7am in the morning. The mini-bar fridge was very small and very old. The walls are very thin and we could smell the person in the next room to us smoking and hear him coughing in the middle of the night.I could see how this would be a nice place for families or people on a budget as its in a great location for shopping and there are plenty of pools to swim in and its right on the beach but the are people as soon as you leave the resort wanting to sell you stuff.After staying at a beautiful resort for 4 nights before coming to Jayakarta it was a tough way to end the holiday.

<Content>Filthy Literal Fleabag Since I paid only $80 a night, I didn't expect much from this hotel but a clean place to sleep.During my four night stay at the Jayakarta Bali, I received over 50 mysterious bites. My friend received over 20 herself. I was uncertain as to what the bites were, or whether it was a rash. You can imagine the panic I felt being so far from home and covered in nasty red bumps.After returning to New York and visiting a dermatologist, I was told that I had a combination of flea and bedbug bites. The Jayakarta is a dirty hotel that one should avoid at all costs. My medical bill cost more than my stay at this fleabag.

<Content>Dissapointed Our first time to Bali, apart from the fact that we both got sick, the room was clean and ok, Kettle took over and hour to heat up and never got to boiling stage, the bathroom and toilet were grotty, needs a bottle of bleach, sheets and towels are dirty grey , not white like they are supposed to be. the restaurant is not the best at all, apart from expensive it is NOT good food, and service at breakfast is a shocker. They advertise on their sign board, days that things are on, DONT change your plans to be there for them, they don;t always happen,eg: Fruit carving and art etc, Would not reccommend the place to my friends and family. On the good side, the pools are awesome,

<Author>BaliHi
<Content>Loved Legian area We stayed at the residence apartments (Club Bali) located on the Jayakarta Hotel property and they worked out very well for us. You cannot beat the location, right on the beach. The Jaya hotel property is beautiful and well maintained.There were five of us and originally we wanted the 3 bedroom apartment but they were fully booked so we booked the 2 bedroom and it worked out fine.We ate mostly at the restaurants on the beach close to the property and they were fantastic. The best one was the Seaside Restaurant. Excellent food and great prices.We booked a driver for the full time we were there and he was great. I used him the first time I went to Bali and kept his card cause he was very good. His name is Gusti and he can be contacted at [--]. I would highly recommend using Gusti as he was always on time, knows Bali very well and is very inexpensive. Do contact him thru his email address and if you plan on going to Bali, you should use his services. He can even book all your activities such as snorkel trips, adventure tours, etc for you and can often get you a discount. Much better than driving on your own or trying to book your activities on your own.Rick F. and family.

<Content>Ok if you dont like luxury! We stayed at the Jayakarta on recommendation as being an ok place to stay in a great location. We stayed in the residance which are individually owned as far we could tell...They all need a lot of work.We didn't like the fact that the staff knocked on our door at around 8.30am to see if we wanted our laundry done, i felt that we were on holidays we didnt want anyone waking us up.The service around the pool could have alot better, the staff were all very nice though and helpful. The location was great though lots of restaurants along the street.Shelley Leavers

<Content>Location is better than the hotel We stayed here for the third time and it was so much moore guests this year. The deluxe rooms are Ok but it is the location you pay for. It was a lot of aussies this year and the problem with them is that the timezone I guess make them very alert in the morning so when we europeans get up it is towels on every sunbed around the pool.... Last year there were a sign at the pool that said that it was not Ok to mark chairs but not this year. There is space enough for at least 50 moore chairs so why don't they buy moore?We did also had a problem at check in this year; we had booked a deluxe room but they put us into an apartment which was terrible and told us that the hotel was fully booked. We did have a deluxe room the day after and two days after arrival we had a welcome-plate with fruit!? The restaurants is so overpriced when there is so many nice places around the hotel. We felt sorry for the staff that stood there every night with no guests. How come the management don't do anything about it?

<Content>A dump, rip-off, poor service Arriving in Bali in late July we first stayed in the Santika Hotel at the Tuban end of Kuta.A pleasant 4* hotel.Unfortunately they were full after 3 days so we checked out.Contacting the Jayakarta we were told that the hotel rooms were full, but they had a 1-bed apartment available (the hotel consists of a hotel, which sits towards to the beach, with two buildings in front of it (toward the road) that constitue the apartments). I was told $85 plus $15 if I wanted breakfast for the third person.I was then asked when I would arrive so they could prepare the room, and said 8pm.Arriving at 8:30pm, we drove in, and I was immediately put off by the setting of the hotel,which is dominated by the car park against the nicely landscaped hotel we'd come from. Unloading family and bags from the car by the lobby, the two bellhops lolling just metres away made no attempt to help by loading the baggage onto a cart. Upon parking I was told to check-in at the building in front for the residence. So I went over to the residence (where I had parked my car), and was greeted by a sour-looking woman. Her manner was not pleasant and upon completing the check-in card she asked me to add my address in a rude manner (you get more pleasant staff in $5 hotels in Indonesia).I was not in a good mood. We were then told to go to our sixth floor room. Upon arrival we were told that despite promises the room was not ready we needed to go back to the lobby. So we did and were shuffled across to the opposite building.On walking through the hotel it's apparent how low-grade it is with poor-quality ugly materials such as the unpainted thick cement that passed for a door frame.The room was little better, having seen better years, with remote for the TV not working, the toilet permanently flushing, the fridge iced up and long ago cleared of its minibar function, the cutlery dirty, the sliding door to the toilet from the bedroom having come off its hinges and ths unusable.At 8:30 the next morning a rude knock came on the door waking us up, requesting to clean the room. Not really what you expect in a hotel. Of course they made no effort to come back at a more civilized hour and clean the room.The breakfast was typical low-grade package tourist, chaotic, with no plates at the egg station (get it yourself, but they've run out at the moment, wait a few minutes), and on ordering two omelettes for wife + myself and handing over the plates and sitting at my nearby the requested omelettes with my requested fillings were inexplicably given to the person behind me. The replacement eggs were wrongly prepared and had to be redone. The food was actually not too bad, but the restaurant was so overcrowded that we didn't bother with it on our second and third nights.On checking out we went down to the lobby of our apartment building. Sorry, you have to check out at the other building It was unclear why they had a lobby there at all, as the one staff seemed to be hiding behind it.So we went to the opposite building. Do you want to pay by credit card? Yes. Sorry, you have to check out in the hotel. So why did the hotel tell me they couldn't check me in there if I had to check out there?Upon finally checking out they had added $11/night to the bill for breakfast for the third person. I told them I had discussed my requirements on the phone and had not requested breakfast, that only two people ate breakfast, on one occasion only, but they insisted I had to pay. Despite an argument they refused to budge.Of course having gone through all this, I missed my flight.Avoid this hellhole, you will get better service in a $20 small hotel/guesthouse, and if you need amenities I'd recommend a proper 4 or 5* place not a package tourist scrum that's really not necessary in Bali, a land where staff are cheap and smiles come for free.

<Content>Look Nice from the Outside, The Room is Different Story The hotel had wonderful setting and great location. But, the room WAS HORRIBLE! First, we were promised that we could go inside the room around 3 pm. However, the room was not ready until 7 pm!!!! We literally stayed outside for about 4 hours!! Very poor management! Then when I went inside, the bathroom floor felt slimy. The bathroom was dirty and had molds in it. When I tried to sit in front of the room, I was sooooo shocked by the condition of the tables and chairs. The colors of the chairs and table literally dark brown (originally was white).IT WAS FILTHY!!!! The staff seemed to not bother to replace it with a clean one. I would not even try to book this hotel in the future....

<Content>Thumbs down for the Jaya Worst hotel experience ever!We arrived to a run-down hotel that was not maintained and filthy. No courtesy drink as advertised when booked. We were placed in a room near the front of the hotel/road and it was a dump. In room movies made the experience slightly better but besides that we stayed out of the room as much as possible.The pool was an exception. Families with kids will love it, quite large and nice. There are two pools from memory (possibly 3).Staff were helpful...however didn't know much when it came to setting up bed.Overall a dissapointment but hey..bali bali bali! I suppose

<Content>A little disappointing Arrived received a welcome drink and booked in a few hours early, great. A family holiday had 3 rooms all were dirty and smelt musky. Complained and was changed to other rooms (immediately no problems) that were clean and no smell. 1 room the air con did not work had to shift again, another room the fridge did not work. It took 3 days to get the fridge repaired. Rooms were cleaned daily to a good standard. Grounds, swimming pools and location on the beach all great. The breakfast was average, (toaster never worked properly) egg counter was great, staff were a bit slack on serving coffee, tea. Staff were very pleasant right throughout the hotel. The poolbar was not open at all in our 12 day stay. The waiters walked around very occassionally to serve drinks. We really enjoyed our holiday but felt the hotel were only interested in filling rooms. Room service was o.k a little pricey but not too bad, like all resorts drink prices rather expensive.Our family would not return to the Jayakarta. We met many people who have stayed at the Jayakarta for years and love it. Each to their own I suppose.

<Content>Horrible vacation in a so called Bali Paradise The Jayakarta Resort uses the ironical Email address of ....@bali-paradise. Its realy not at all a PARADISE environment. Beside in a distance of few meters only since 2 years heavy construction work is going on. A hotel of huge size build in only a distance you can actually jump over from the apartment balcony to the open air corridor of this new hotel and viz versa. Here in AUS or NZ we would never get a permit to build such close to a existing building, facing in so closed distance hunderts of existing apartment balconies. This is shurly no pardise like anymore. BUT the worst thing on all is that any complaint to the Resort Management is totally fruitless and ends up with a ignorance of first class. This Resort Management forget that some years ago Bali was totally empty and only peoples like us, yearly making twice vacation in Bali have come still for vacation in this Resort and we got ALL TIMES BEST SERVICE and ATTENTION because of very few Bali Visitors have been in Bali, That times most of the Staff has been sent of to a forced vacation because of empty hotels. Now after Bali has recovered, it seams that any complaint which needs high attention from the Top Management to sort out unhappiness of guests due to bad environment created by the Neighbouring Hotel Owners Construction, of dusty works until late nigth. even also on sundays, even you can not dry a towel or a paint on the balcony without having it after a few minutes full of cement cutting dust. Our Guest as well we got the feelings and the impression that guests putting complaints to the resort management are not much welcome and rather considered as a disturbant factor to the peacefull day to day life of the Managers in charge.Presently we do not at all recommend this Resort until the Jayakarta Residence Management will publically confirm that all construcion works are over and normal Hotel Operation has started at the neighbour hotel. But we will also test the new build hotel and compare with the old Jayakarta facilities to find out if in future where we will make our annually twice vaction at this hotel rather than again in Jayakarta Resort.

<Content>Good all round hotel I stayed here with two girl friends for 10 nights. We had a great time. The rooms are clean but I would recommend a delux room over the standard rooms. Originally we were in a standard room with leaky air con. The delux rooms seem cleaner, are bigger and have nicer balconies. The air con worked really well. The food at the hotel was fairly poor. Breakfast was the same every morning with limited choices. This didnt bother us much at all since you can get great meals for great prices within a 2 minute walk from the hotel. There is also a great internet place right outside the hotels gates. We went out alot and found the bars along legian beach to be the best- nicer atmosphere and less crowded compared to those in Kuta. You can walk to kuta from the hotel it takes around an 1hr. Otherwise cabs everywhere are cheap and usually us a meter. Legian beach is not clean at all and we were recommended by a local not to swim there. Personally I would not recommend this as a romantic place to stay. The staff at front desk were generally unhelpful, and at times rude particulary on depature. However I would stay here again as the location is great and so cheap.

<Content>enjoyed our stay I stayed at the Jayakarta in January 08 with my 15 year old daughter, although the rooms were pretty ordinary, the grounds were lovely and well looked after, the pools were great, really big and maintained well.We ate at the restauraunts a couple of times and enjoyed the food but as others have said if you step out your door there are heaps of places to eat nearby that are cheaper and very close.Breakfast was average and this was included in our package so we didn't bother much.We had a great time and found the staff very helpful. Our first room was facing a wall, so after a few days I asked to be moved to a room overlooking the pool this was able to happen two days later and a porter was sent to help us move.We met so many different people from all over the world and I am still in contact with a few of them.A free mini bus is available to take you to Kuta every couple of hours and the beach, nightclubs and restraunts on the beach are a short walk away.All in all we really enjoyed our time at the Jayakarta and would return.There are so many different people from different cultures and all walks of life at the hotel.I figure you are only sleeping in the room and it is the pool and people that are important :}

<Content>Not bad but bit of a dump We paid about $US55 (in Jan 2008) a night for our superior room and all in all the room was very clean, nicely decorated and a slightly snazzy bathroom. It's a great hotel for the price but if you have the slightess distain for toothless men with tattoos drinking in the pool bar then this is not the place for you. The clientale range from young Korean girls to dutch couples in their 60's to young groups of Australians to Indian businessmen. It's not the best place for a couple over 30, pools are a bit shabby (but still nice) and the resturant is dreadful and expensive. Expensive means about $US30 for a pizza, a gado gado, a coffee and a bintang. The breakfast is a hell fight with 100 people, ants in the food, food running out, spoons running out and inedible eggs. We actually checked out early and lashed out on a more expensive place. However you're just sleeping there and running off each morning it is the best value around. Some of the nearby hotels such as Hotel Padma looked like jails. Cant fault the staff they are lovely and very friendly. Great place for taliors - try Budi tailor across the road. A great leather shop if you turn right upon leaving the hotel visit 'Mira Shop' - House of leather, they made me some beautiful leather boots for 50 bucks!Julia, Sydney

<Content>Huge roomy great facilities but impersonal  We stayed 15 nights at jayakarta in the private residence.We booked private ones thru the interent so they are not hotel owned. We had heard that these apartments are far more superior to the hotel owned rooms and the rumours were true.We could not at all fault the apartments. They are beautiful, very well set out, completely furnished with very comfy leather lounge, and beds and pillows were the best. The kitchen was fully kitted out with all you could need. The fridge is a good size with freezer and a water dispenser is in each kitchen and the cleaner will replace with a new bottle when it becomes low. Each room had its own individual controlled aircond so you could set your own temp and they worked perfectly.There is really not any views to anywhere from your balcony but it was good to have a balcony to sit on in evenings and early mornings and to hang wet things on.!!The residence block is apart from the hotel blocks of rooms. The whole complex is huge and sprawling and that was my only complaint.It is just too big. The residence is at the beginning of the hotel near entrance and then the other hotel room blocks are down closer to the pool in vaious different postions. The residence is a LONG way / walk to the pool and most days in the heat none of us could be bothered with the walk once you had come in from shopping or day trips.We used the pool 4 days out of 15 and each time there was absolutely NO pool service. Not once did I see any wait/persons going around ordering or delivering food or drinks and that is around all 3 pools. That was very disappoiinting. There is a hut you can go into for massages but I didnt use it as i was usually watching kids swimming. We ate at the hotel for breadkfast twice and it is very expensive and the variety not great. There was only 1 choice of cereal and it looked like cornflakes but did not taste like them. No kids cereal choices at all. There was an egg man to make you what you desired, but no pancake cook. There were ready made pancakes and the usual array of hot foods and toast, breads, danish etc. The restaurant at nights was mostly deserted but there are so many good ones nearby that i imagine you would be crazy to pay hotel prices when a 3 min walk will get you to plenty of other eating places.The pools were very clean and well maintained and the location is perfect for all the beach side restaurants and many others. s all in all I would have to say only average with nothing really to get you exited and yearning for a return visit. Whilst I wasnt hugely disappointed ( as the rooms made up for any negatives)I wasnt satisfied with my choice either and I would not choose to stay again. I do prefer somewehere with a good pool service and more personal touches.

<Content>Jayakarta Residence - Average large hotel We stayed at the Jayakarta Residence for 4 nights over New Years Eve 2007/2008. Upon arrival, although we specifically booked (and paid the more expensive price for) two one bedroom apartments, staff attempted to force us to take a two bedroom apartment. We managed to stay in our booked room type, but when we were shown to our room we were disappointed to find that our small verandah, which only fit one chair on it, faced the wall of the adjacent Jayakarta Hotel.The room was fairly nice, but was nothing special. The lighting in the room really made it seem quite depressing, and the fact that no complementary water was provided was disappointing.We attended the 'compulsory' new year's eve dinner, which was quite good, and was one of the positive things of our stay.To top off the experience, we were overcharged at checkout, and when we questioned this, the bill was revised to a higher price! It took three goes to get the bill right!The Jayakarta Residence was ok, but definitely nothing special. I would say that there would be nice places to stay for a similar price.

<Content>Brushed Off We booked this hotel 1 1/2 months in advance. The hotel then called us 4 days before our trip to let us know they weren't going to honour the reservation leaving us with very few last minute alternatives. Although Travelocity tried many times to contact the hotel, they gave no reason nor were they apologetic for the cancellation. So if you don't want to be ditched at the last minute, look elsewhere.

<Content>Not bad Same as some other reviews, booked a 1 bed apartment and quickly asked to be moved as it was to far from pool, bar etc. Next room was ok right beside pool which was good. Food and drink expensive but the chicken satay skewers were the best i have had in the world. Probably went at a bad time in November as it is 'Schoolies time' so was pretty noisy at all times and there was a few wedding receptions booked so wasn't able to kick back in the pool those nights. All up would recommend to families and thats about it. Not good for singles :(

<Content>Good Value On arrival to the Jayakarta we got given really crappy rooms, but all it took was a bit of sweet talking and we got a nice pool view suite. Dodgy wiring in the place but aside from that it was good.Loved hanging around the pool on days it was too hot to do anything (we were there for 14 days so time wasn't a problem) although you have to be up at the crack of dawn to get a sun lounge! Food was awesome, massage  day spa was amazing value and the service was great too. The location can't be beaten for Legian and there are so many restaurants just out the front.Would DEFINATELY stay here again.

<Content>Average mass-market tourist hotel Stayed here for five nights in August 07. Hotel: a large hotel complex, consisting of a number of separate blocks spread out over a relatively large area, next to the beach in Legian - Kuta, Bali. A typical tourist hotel, mainly catering to mass-market package tourism. Most guests appear to be Australian, as well as a minority of Europeans and other nationalities. The hotel displays four stars at reception, however I would not consider this more than a three star hotel based on the amenities in the room and services offered. There are several swimming pools as well as a tennis court and other facilities on-site.Location: because of it being beachside, and its relative closeness to the action in Kuta, the location is good for tourists looking for a typical Bali holiday. The area around the hotel and Legian as a whole are pleasant, touristy places with lots of good restaurant options and shops where good bargains can be found for those who know how to negotiate. Bali still offers a good holiday experience.Room: this hotel offers a number of room options, one being the one bedroom residence. We had booked this initially, however these residences are located in a block relatively far and inland from the main building. This type of unit consists of a living room with kitchenette, and a separate bedroom as well as a balcony. The bathroom has a shower over bathtub. As we did not like the distance from the main building, plus the unit was rather dark and overlooking a construction site, we asked to change rooms. We were moved to another, more basic room that was closer to the main building. The next day, at our request, we were once again moved to an oceanview room (this has a view of the garden nearby and a bit of ocean further away through the trees, with the beach being around 50 meters from the room). In all, we experienced three rooms at this hotel. The rooms are basic, and there is no in-room safe (they have a system with deposit boxes at reception, but this is an inconvenient solution). The TV in one of the rooms had a yellow hue to the picture, and we did not watch TV during our stay. The room in the 1 bedroom residence had no minibar, the second and third rooms had one. Other items in the room include a basic writing desk, a lounge chair and small table, as well as a wardrobe. Air conditioning, although in two of the three rooms somewhat older units, worked well. In two of the three rooms the toilet would continue flowing after flushing, and required manipulation of the flush handle to stop the flow. The drains in one of the rooms were partially blocked (water buildup in the bathroom sink when running the tap, and in the bath tub during shower).Cleanliness: none of the three rooms were clean - two rooms had various hairs throughout the bathroom, and both toilet and bath tub not looking clean (stains, no smoothly shining surfaces). In one room the floor had drop spots near the toilet. Also the sheets in the bed in the second room had not been changed (they had only changed the pillowcases). The third room had no hairs, but the floor was not clean. There is clearly a failure at this hotel to supervise their housekeeping staff properly, and the result is dirty rooms.Breakfast buffet: relatively basic. A number of key items lacking, such as cheese and ham or sliced meats (only marmalade, jam and vegemite supplied). Also missed tomato juice. However several hot options (fried rice, noodles, potatoes and a few more). Egg chef present to cook eggs to your liking. The restaurant is small for the size of the hotel, so it gets quite a busy feel to it during breakfast time. Overall acceptable, but not more than that.Staff: generally friendly, but not exceptionally so.Booking: booked the hotel online at a good rate.Internet: no in-room Internet access available. No wireless networks visible in the area. There is a business centre near the entrance of the complex (about 300 meters from the main building) which has a cluster of PCs available with Internet access, which is charged for by the minute. There are several Internet cafe's in the area near the hotel entrance.Restaurants: we only experienced the breakfast restaurant at the hotel which was acceptable but no more than that. Shopping: there is a free shuttle to Kuta from the hotel that departs every two hours or so, daytime only.Transport: a taxi from the airport to the hotel costs 50,000 Rupiah and is a 10-minute ride or so (follow taxi signs and buy ticket at the taxi window at the airport prior to going to taxi). At the airport, uniformed porters try to assist with luggage (they can be pushy). If you don't want this, you may have to insist on taking your own suitcase. The hotel has shuttle buses to Kuta every two hours or so (ask at reception).Climate: we were there in mid-August and the weather was sunny and not overly hot - late twenties to around 30 degrees. A good time to visit, climate-wise.Conclusion: an average mass-market tourist hotel, generally at the level of a three-star, with unclean rooms. I cannot recommend the Jayakarta and will not come back here. Bali has a good selection of hotels so it should be easy to find something better.

<Content>loved every minute My wife and i, and a friend went to bali two years ago and had the best time ever. The hotel was very good, not the Ritz but we didn't pay for the Ritz. The room was very clean and comfortable and they are cleaned and servised every day and it was very adequate for what we wanted, somewhere to sleep and relax if we came back during the day,better than places we have stayed in within Australia. The staff where very frendly and helpfull.We used one of the hotels drivers to get around and again he was excellent. The gardens where a plesure to walk around lush and green, the pools were spotless. The breakfasts again where very good and plenty of it. My wife and i will be going back for sure, as soon as family commitments allow and we will stay at the Jayakarta Hotel for sure.

<Content>Excellent choice Just got back from a 5 night stay at the Jayakarta. the hotel is located in Legian and is close enough to both Kuta and Seminyak. Either a long walk along the beach or a cheap taxi ride ( say 5-7,000 R).there are a couple of excellent restaurants within 100 metres of the hotel on the beachside ie Blue Ocean ,Seaside and a number of other restaurants in the streets back of beach.We had originally booked Sofitel Seminyak - but after reading reviews on Trip Advisor we decided to move to the Jayakarta and are very pleased we did. the location and the grounds are excellent as are the three pools. We chose the quieter pool near the pizza place.We were happy with breakfast - just enough choice - and the chef cooking your choice of eggs on demand was a bonus.The room ( superior pool room) was well located - but was just a motel room with a small balcony. the air con was a little noisy and the rooms probably need at least a cosmetic upgrade. But for USD 56 per night - they were just fine! The ground flor units may be better as they open out onto the grass - particulary if you had children and booked two adjoining rooms.The hawkers on the beach are just doing their job - but can be a bit of a pain at times. If you want a watch go and see Honest Bob. If you want to hire a surf board and /or have a drink on the beach - move down the beach about 100 metres ( right near the gate on the pathway - just north of Bali Niksoma) to Lanis place and see Lani and Wayan.We loved our short stay in Bali and can't wait to go back.

<Content>Average Hotel As a group of 4, we originally booked our stay with Jayakarta in one of the apartments, once we checked in we quickly asked to be moved to the hotel part of the resort, the apartments were very run down, and about a 10 minute walk from the pool to the apartment! So we got upgraded to 2 pool view rooms, which we were more happy with, still a very standard hotel room. The 3 pools are nice and there is a Spa as well which was nice to have some drinks in after dark.The breakfasts were very average, not much selection and most of the time not being re-stocked fast enough. It did take a while to get tea/coffee served and i found the staff pretty rude at breakfast.All things aside though, this hotel is at a VERY good price and it is right next door to a strip of restaurants and night spots which certainley served their purpose, have dinner or drinks at the place right next door at Sunset, absolutely stunning! I most likely would come here again just for the fact its so very close to Seminyak but we pay Legian prices!

<Content>Very Very plaisant stay I have been in Bali in August 2005 with my father (55 y.o) and my sisters (22 and 28 y.o). We loved the stay at this hotel. We started our trip by staying there for 2 nights, then came back at the end of the trip for 3 other nights. The emplacement is slightly retired from the main shopping streets so we can have some tranquility but not too far so we can walk around in the city and shop. It is directly on the beach, only separated by a stone wall.The rooms are clean and beautiful, and we got upgraded on our second stay to a room near the pool. The pools are clean and the food is very good. We loved eating pizza for lunch beside the pool. For supper, we prefered to eat outside and try the local restaurants. The beach is beautiful, but the waves were too strong to swim. The waves must have been wonderful for the surfers (but I do not surf).There was only 2 things we did not like. First, there are a lot of people harassing you to buy stuff on the beach. They don't come inside the hotel's walls, but it was enough to keep us inside the hotel's walls. The other thing we did not like was the sunday night spectacle with supper. The food was not very good and the spectacle was weird... we did not know if we wanted to laugh or cry to have paid the extra cash for it !So overall, it is a wonderful hotel and I recommand it greatly.

<Content>Just as good 2nd visit My family and I have stayed at the Jayakarta twice now. Last year we booked 2 one bedroom apartments, and although it was nice to have some extra space, they aren't really apartments, just a fridge, sink and microwave in the living area, which was quite dark as the window overlooked the corridor. This year we booked the standard rooms which were fine.The location of this hotel is perfect, it's very easy to get the shuttle bus or a taxi into Kuta for shopping. The beach is right by the back entrance to the hotel and there are plenty of good restaurants along the road, all within 2-4 minute walk.The breakfast is reasonably good. The choice isn't massive, but you can get freshly fried eggs and omelettes, and there was always a good choice of fruit. Very little cereal, butplenty of breads and cakes. The hotel restaurant is always open but doesn't seem to do much trade, probably because they don't go out of their way to advertise it, and there are so many other choices nearby.The hotel grounds are beautiful, and are being tended all the time. The swimming pools are lovely, and were never very crowded. There is also tennis, plus beauty treatments and massage.The hotel rooms are a little tired looking, but kept perfectly clean, and offer incredibly good value.
