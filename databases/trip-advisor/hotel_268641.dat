<Content>Great Place to Stay We stayed at this hotel for three nights. I have to say that I was a little nervous booking this hotel after reading some of the negative reviews on this website but I took my chances. Being the Winter Music Conference Weekend it was hard to find a Hotel with such a great rate as this one.Upon checking in I was very surprised. The room looked exactly like in the pictures. It was very clean and organized. The bathroom was very clean and maintained. The jacuzzi was great. The pool area was very nice and clean with all the statues and garden look. The Hotel was not in a bad area as mentioned, the area was actually very quiet. The restaurant closes early. Not much around so you need a car to get around.South Beach and MIA are bout 15 minutes away. There is a rt.441 close by about 5 minutes. You will find anything you need there. Food, Gas, pharmacy, etc.I would definately stay at this hotel again. The service and hotel staff were great and overall a great experience.

<Content>Horrible experience in every facet This was both one of the worst and most bizarre hotels I have ever stayed at. The grounds look beautiful on the outside, complete with dozens of renaissance-style statues. But that is where the pleasantness ends. The inside of the hotel is rundown, dirty and lacking in security. Service was terrible. I would not recommend this hotel to my enemy.My wife and I thought we were getting a steal for about $115 a night for a room with a whirlpool. Wow, were we wrong! The room had numerous stains on the ceiling. It smelled very musty and reeked of cleaning chemicals. We opened the window to air it out, which helped, but the bathroom never lost its rank odor. (We prebooked three nights -- big mistake!) Each additional night we stayed there, the more stains I noticed in the room. There was gum stuck on the bed's headboard along with various carvings from prior guests. Basically, the room looked as if it hadn't been maintained at all for at least a year.But the condition of the room was just the beginning of our problems. The hotel is in a very bad part of town and nowhere near any attractions. I found it bizarre that this supposedly high-end hotel was located in such a poor area with no other hotels anywhere nearby. Worst of all, though, is the utter lack of security. We heard loud fights in rooms nearby. One night about 5 or 6 young men who appeared to be gang members sat down in the middle of the hallway near our room and stayed there for several hours, with no appearance by management. Late at night it was the norm to encounter shady characters wandering the hotel hallways. We started propping a chair in front of our door at night. To add to the nightmare, the lock on the room door was faulty and did not always lock when it closed, so when leaving we had to fiddle with it until it locked.Amazingly, even the poor security was not the worst part of our experience! The worst part was the utter lack of cleaning service. No one performed any cleaning whatsoever during our three-day stay. Our second night we had to call the front desk three times just to get some clean towels and sheets. The third night we decided not to even bother. The absolute worst of all was the dingy fitted bedsheet we were forced to use during our stay. It was so worn out that it constantly pulled off the mattress so that I woke up 5 or 6 times every night to the pleasant sensation of bare mattress under my skin (and God only knows what nastiness was on that mattress, given the dinginess of the rest of the room). We ended up using some pins we had brought with us to pin the sheet to the mattress, but even that did not work very well. I have never stayed at a hotel that did not even have a sheet that fit the mattress.Lastly, there was no Internet access in the rooms. To gain access, you had to take your computer down to the lobby, navigating the unsafe hallways with a $2,000 computer in hand.The only positive to our stay was that the whirlpool worked adequately, but we hardly used it because of the revolting condition of the rest of the room. Even the continental breakfast was subpar and poorly stocked. We didn't use the pool, but it looked dirty. We felt fortunate that our car wasn't broken into during our stay.Don't be fooled by pictures of the outside of this hotel. Perhaps in its prime this was a nice place to spend a weekend, but in the present day it is dingy and neglected. Do whatever it takes to stay far, far away from this hotel!

<Content>very disappointed i have sent a complaint to Expedia about this hotel and a review after they sent me an e-mail asked if i would review the hotel,i told them that the place looks nice from the outside and the young lady who checked us in was pleasent and very helpful,but after that oh dear,both Expedia and the hotels own website describe the corporate king room has having large screen tv`s,in-room safes,clock radios,irons,hair dryers,the corporate king we had was lacking in all these items,the small telly had 39 channels but only 20 had a watchable picture,the in-room safe was a hole in the carpet,no clock radio,no iron or ironing board,but to be fair there is no mention of a ironing board anyway,there was on the wall a holder for a iron,as for the hair dryer no sign of one of them either,the bottom sheet on the bed ended up in the middle of the bed on both nights because it was so small,the two men we spoke to at reception were just there to hold the seat from floating away,we asked one if the little havana area in miami was ok to visit and he kept going on about some restaurant with the same name,then it was breakfast time,being english we liked to have a drink of tea with our breakfast(not too much to ask is it)but no hot water never mind any tea bags,when my wife asked about this she was told the hotel has nothing to do with breakfast and should talk to the catering contractor about this,i read there was no place to eat close by but did not expect to have to travel so far to see anywhere to eat,if you are going to Miami either spend less money or more money and stay somewhere other than this place!.

<Content>Wouldn't Stay again if they Paid ME!!! No where near the beach as claimed, hotel staff seemed to spend more time in the parking lot talking to others than actually in the hotel. Was booked for two nights - room was changed 3 times and only one night was actually spent at hotel. Here is the list of what we experienced in 24 hours at this dump ~1) Bugs in rooms2) No lighting in room except wall light near door3) Of two beds one had 1 sheet and a blanket, the other had two sheets and no blanket4) TV didn't work in one room5) TV remote didn't work in another room6) Bathroom had mold growing in all three bathrooms7) Bathrooms all had less than half a roll of toilet paper - no tissues and one room only had one set of towels8) Uneaten food found in nightstand with bugs having a buffet9) Housekeeping put out Do Not Disturb sign rather than tidy the room or change the linens.10) Front desk wouldn't fix any problems, would just offer to change our room11) Phones didn't work in rooms12) Safe didn't work in rooms13) Parking lot was always blocked offOverall I wouldn't wish this hotel on my worst enemy. Not sure when the remodel occured but they missed a bit of the hotel...the hole in the marble baseboard of the elevator would be one area. If anyone would like a nice close up picture of the bugs in our room I can be sure to send. Pretty sure this review won't make it to the website though.

<Content>Diamond in the rough First things first. This Hotel should have a restaurant. There is nothing and I mean nothing in the area. That would be the only negative I would have . The grounds and the rooms where very clean and the staff was great. They made me and my family feel like we where at home. We received a welcome email when we made our reservation and a thank you emial the day after we checked out. Nice touch! We stayed four days, by the second day, the staff knew my kids by their first names. This Hotel is truely a diamond in the rough. I would imagine that a Hotel like this on the beach would be a better fit. We enjoyed our stay and we will return.

<Content>Rediculous This hotel was by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. They never put toilet paper or towels in the room haf to go to front desk for everything. They never cleaned the room the phone did not work. and two days into the stay before we realized the door wouldn't lock. When they decided to change that door wouldn't lock either. The pool was dirty. Safe in room didn't work. Maintence man said room was not to be listed as available since door didn't work. Breakfast was horrible. They wouln't even refund any of the monies spent on the room. It also smelled like mildrew. In conclusion stay at this hotel at yor on risk someone might walk in on you.

<Content>Getting a little run down, but still cheap Have stayed here in the past, must say the place seemed more run down. First room the A/C wasn't working and the latch lock was broken, so had to get another room. Second room needed a new light bulb for the bed lamp, and the safe needed new batteries to work. While staff was quick to fix this, you would expect this stuff to be done before hand. Maintenance guy said they were short handed. Hallway carpeting had noticable stains. Room furniture/carpeting a bit run down and musty and I didn't want to put my clothes in the dresser. If you stay here, bring the wet-wipes to sanitize the furniture and wear slippers inside. Positives: cheap budget room rate during Spring Break season (even after silly resort fee). Bathroom/towels/bedding reasonably clean. Free continental breakfast, but get there early or they start to run out of stuff. There's a Subway (sandwich) shop a block away in the office park next door that's really nice.

<Content>Great rate , Great Satff! We booked this Hotel for Spring Break. I had never heard of the Hotel so I was not sure what to expect. The rate was excelllant so I was not really expecting much. However, the staff was great, the rate was great and service was very friendly. The staff seemed to be of all different nationalities which was cool for me being from New York. All in all, we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Good Dolphins Stadium location....so so hotel Pros:1. Shuttle ride to Orange Bowl from hotel, very close to stadium2. Easy access to interstate3. The state of the rooms will motivate you out the door to explore Miami, not so clean, kind of stale smelling and old decor, etc.4. Staff friendly and quick to fix any problem5. Least expensive Hotel recommended on Orange Bowl siteCons:1. Absolutely NOTHING around the hotel, no restaurants, shopping, NOTHING! Make sure you have a rental car.2. Cleanliness so-so, maybe okay for indiscriminate folks on a budget (like us). As stated above, it will motivate you to leave and explore Miami.3. All attractions are at least 20 to 30 minute drive.4. Pool is located next to a busy overpass. We drove to the beach (about a 20 minute drive).

<Content>Nice Rooms, Friendly Staff We had never heard of this Hotel but we found the roomsto be nicer than we expected and the staff was very friendly. They went out of their way to be sure we where taken care of. There is not much to see in the area so be prepared to drive atlas 10 to 15 minutes to the Beach or other attractions.

<Content>NO Security BAD BAD AREA - We stayed on Christmas  our car was broken into. This hotel does not have good security and is in a very bad area. DO NOT STAY unless you have alarm on your car. Nice rooms, but we will NEVER stay here again, because of safety reasons.

<Content>Never Again! I booked a room at the Elpalacio for my vacation as a getaway, big mistake. Problem #1, the remote control for the television did not work. They finally responded to the problem 3 hours later and offered to switch my room, which was not an opinion because I had already unpacked. Problem #2 when I went to turn on the AC I noticed that there where ants crawling on top of the unit. Problem #3 At about 9:45am housekeeper enter my room while I was in bed. When she noticed I was there she ran out of the room. I recieved a knock at my door around 11:00am by another housekeeping to clean the room. I then asked the housekeeper if she could give me 5 minutes, because I was on my way out and she said yes. When I exited the room, she appeared to be entering the room to clean, but when I returned at 2:30pm the room was still in the same condition which made me angry because I had returned to the room to rest. I immediately came out and approached another housekeeper, who informed that she was sending someone right away. I waited for another 45 minutes, still no one. I then went to the front desk where a gentleman gave me, the guest, directions to housekeeping so that I could inquire on my behalf because he was too busy on the phone. He should have been the one to resolve the matter.Finally the housekeeper returned to the room to give fresh towels and empty the garbage pails, were left empy. She left a roll of gabage bags on the bathroom sink, I guess that was for me to do.Overall, I did not care for the service that I recieved. The room had an odor ( it's a good thing I brought the febreeze), and next time I think I'll spend the extra money and get something decent because this hotel was far from it.

<Content>Perfect getaway at the El Palacio Boutique  We stayed one night in El Palacio, we rented a queen jacuzzi suite. At our arrival, the staff was very friendly and eager to assist our every need. The suite was amazing. The jacuzzi is located just steps away from your bed where you can enjoy the comfort of relaxing in the hot water and watching television! We paid in total $130 for our nights stay, but it was worth every penny. This is the perfect place to stay and get away from everyday's hassels and spend quality time with your loved ones. There is plenty to do at El Palacio, there is a pool for those who love to swim, a cafeteria for those late night cravings, and their own sports bar is you are looking to watch a game or just hang out without even leaving the hotel. I encourage everyone to stay atleast one night to see what magical getaway you will have!

<Content>Very Cool! I was very surprised with this Hotel. As some of the comments say, the location is not exactly South Beach but the service was like being in the tropics. The staff was very warm and friendly. The rooms where larger than what I expected and the Jacuzzi was a very nice touch. The service from housekeeping was a little slow but they too where very nice. It really was like being in another Country. Good Job all around. Very Cool Hotel.

<Content>Nice, actually This hotel may be the best of the budget-priced hotels near Miami. Nice enough to host occasional wedding parties, it still falls a little short of the label boutique hotel. Still, the rooms are clean, spacious and new-looking. Some ticky-tacky decorating touches, plus the exterior Grecian motif, may be someone else's taste but not mine. The staff must have thought they were employed at a Four Seasons, because I saw them treat everyone at the front desk with courtesy and politeness. The biggest negative is the location. Situated at a confluence of too many freeways, and a victim of Miami's insane street numbering system, it is easy to get lost. So remember this: whichever direction you are going on the 95, exit at 826-WEST. 12th AVE is the first offramp, and the hotel is just on the right. The area is purely industrial, with plenty of buildings with names like ACME Plastics. There really is nowhere to eat within 4 miles or so (except at the hotel).OVERALL: Value: A Location: C

<Content>A Wonderful Surprise I stayed at the El Palacio Boutique Hotel in March 2006. As soon as I drove up to this hotel, I began a wonderful experience. Since I did not have many bags, I opted to bring my bags in myself. A worker from the hotel came to my car and took my bags from my car to my room. The check in was fast and easy. The rooms were much better than I expected. Very easy access to I-95. All the workers in the hotel were very friendly. It was a very positive experience staying here. Would stay here again.

<Content>bad experience we booked this hotel for 10 nights.We arrived at 1 pm after 9 hours flight and asked to check in. Prompt answer:not before 3 pm .That's it !So we went for a coffee and came back early evening.Our double king size room was not available , so we were upgraded to a single king size. Ok for me but when we came in the room I noticed it was situated on the side were the motorway passes at 50m.Traffic 24 hours guaranteed ! An example of intelligent coordination when you know people are going to stay for 10 nights.So the day after we asked for another room on the other side. Which was not a problem.Quiet room , nice , we thought....But ..! Another intelligent move was made by the front desk manager , assigning the rooms left, right and in front of me to group of unrespectful youngsters. Shouting, screaming, banging on the walls , using language according to their education I went to complain and understood I had to accept this. It was all normal due to spring break.Let them party !!The same night at 1 am we packed and ran from this hotel (read:hell )never again !Though..My appreciation goes to 2 people working in this hotel. Thank you Danny and Amanda for your help.You deserve better

<Content>Average-but cheap We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. We booked it through their website at what we thought was $59 a night. The number of taxes and fees on every little thing was unbelievable. Taxes are expected but there were lots of hidden costs making the 2 night stay more like $75 a night.We also were disappointed with the restaurant. They boasted all over the place about their fabulous breakfast buffet. When we went down on Sunday morning, the restaurant acted like they had never heard of it. The staff was not too helpful on that either.Okay hotel, cheap, but watch out for hidden costs.

<Content>Den of Thieves / Poor Service/ Very Noisy Do not stay at this hotel if you care about your valuables! Our nightmare started when we arrived at 2:30pm, about a half hour before check in time. The room was not ready and the hotel would not take our bags. We wanted to hit Miami Beach and were told we could change in the bathroom (in the vacant sports bar), which we did. Having had my hands full with my kids, I accidentally left behind my pouch containing my wallet and travel documents. I realized I was missing the pouch about a half hour later and promptly called the hotel. They had found my pouch where I had left it. When I went back to my hotel and examined the pouch, all contents were intact, except for $300. I asked about the money and noticed that the individual that gave me the pouch had a large sum of bills in his hand. I asked him if it was my money and he said that it was his (he earned it giving music lessons). I didn't have any identifying markers on the bills so obviously, I didn't have a case. Had I kept my mouth shut and returned promptly to the bathroom myself, I'm sure the pouch would have still been there with the money because the area was empty.The second issue we have with the hotel is when we checked into the room. The bathroom floor was wet from a leak originating from the bathroom above. I called the front desk and after maintenance examined the situation, was told I needed to switch rooms. The front desk did not offer to move my family's luggage to the room, which happened to be at the other end of the hotel. I had to *ask* for help, which came in the form of a cart. The front desk had the nerve to leave the cart with me without offering any kind of help. The third and final issue was the awful noise on Saturday night. This hotel is used for weddings and the guests woke us up at 2:00am. The conversations were so loud I thought people were fighting (it frightened us). I called security and things quieted down. Then it started again with not one but two different groups of people. Fortunately, the last two ended quicker than the first conversation/arguement.I agree with other reviewers when they state that the rooms are large and are in reasonable shape. However, I would not recommend staying in a hotel that employs thieves, offers poor service and holds wedding parties. Steer clear even if it means paying more. Our stay cost us a lot more than we expected.

<Content>Very nice! My family and I where very happy with our stay.We originally booked at another Hotel. That Hotel lost our reservation so they referred us to El Palacio. It turned out to be a great deal.We received a suite with huge wide screen tv and a jacuzzi for the same price we where paying for a basic roomat the fist Hotel. Very nicely done El Palacio. Oh yea. the restaurant was incredible with the plasma tvs and the NFL ticket. My wife kids checked out the malls while I was in NFL heaven with all the ganes playing at once.Very nice.

<Content>The Jacuzzi is a nice touch I visited the El Palacio Boutique Hotel this past weekend and I found the entire place outside and in to be suprisingly nice. I reserved my stay over the internet. When I arrived, I was told that the my room was not ready and that I would be upgraded at no extra charge. Very nice. When I got my room, there it was. A jacuzzi. That was a real suprise and a very nice touch. I enjoyed my stay. The Jacuzzi was GREAT and the new restaurant is amazing.Very nice!

<Content>Rotting cesspool cio over other hotels in the area because the website stated it was new. When we arrived we found out that it was once a condemned hotel and was refurbished by the new owners. So we decided to give it a try.The first room we checked into was a no smoking room. This was funny because it reeked of smoke. So we asked to move. The next room was just as awful. There was mildew all over the tiles and bathtub. We again asked to be moved but this time my father and I checked out the rooms before we once again moved all of our families stuff. We went through 3 nasty rooms before we found one suitable. We wouldn't have stayed except that it was late, the neighborhood not so great and the fact that we were only going to be there for one night. In my own opinion this is one to skip!

<Content>A silk purse from a cow's ear? The remodeled El Palacio begs the proverbial question can you make a silk purse from a cow's ear. Rooms are cramped but clean, suites are not suites but rooms with more stuff crammed in them and a small patio. The crammed jacuzzi rooms are a unique but mixed plus, and service borders on criminal.

<Content>Completely awful! I was fooled by the beautiful pictures! The resort is not new...it's an old remodeled Ramada Inn far from the beach and in a terrible part of town. The staff was completely unprofessional. We were actually handed a plunger when our toilet overflowed! The MVP Bar and Grill on the first floor is more like dumpy gangster club, complete with live rappers and expensive cars?? We were suckered in by the new introductory rate of $49.99/night. Well, with all the bed charges??...and safe charges???...it ended up being at least $70/night! Traveling in miami, we saw so many nicer places offering better rates (these places were not found online when I was trip planning!).To top it off...one month later, now march...I find out that someone has been using my debit card number, expiration date, and home address to make charges in Northern Miami. This hotel is the only place in Miami that had access to all of this information while we were there!

<Content>Very Nice experience  I must say I enjoyed my stay. When I first checked in I opted for a standard room. I then changed my mind and decided to upgrade to the jacuzzi suite. The staff were very professional and courteous about the change and made it go smooth. I just wanted to get away for a couple of days and this was one of my most enjoyable hotel experiences. I will go back soon and have reconmmended this hotel to all of my friends and business associates!!!!!!

<Content>Terrible Experience The El Palacio in Miami, FL was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. There were a number of problems. First, The room we were given had an alarm clock that did not work. Second, it had an air condition/heat unit that was missing a knob so the temperature couldn't be adjusted. When I explained this to management they told me that there was nothing they could do and that I would have to remove the knob from the on/off control and place it on the temp control and switch the knob back and forth. Thirdly there was extremely poor lighting in the room. There was only one nightstand lamp and one wall fixture by the entrance to the room. When I asked management about this, they said that is all the light you get. I explained to them that I couldn't read a book at the table or even see myself in the mirror because it was so dark. They said they couldn't do anything about it. Fourth, I inquired about the charges for connecting to the internet via modem. The person at the frontdesk did not know the rates or how it was billed. I asked him to look it up for me and he said that they did not have the rates written anywhere. Fifth, no where is it mentioned that the hotel serves as a night club at night. I had to wait in line behind people attending the night club just to park my car and get into the hotel. I have been in one star hotels that have provided much better rooms and especially much better customer service. Management offered no apologies or remedies to the complaints I had. I ended my stay at the El Palacio early and checked into another hotel.

<Content>wedding bliss When my husband and I decided to get married we wanted a lovely location to have the wedding reception. The hotel was new then, as we got married november,99. The owner at the time , who passed away a couple years back was just the best....everywhere was just beautiful and a lovely setting. We ended up not using the banquet hall of hotel as our guest list got longer and used El palacio banquet halls, which has now closed unfortunately. However our guest would stay there and I blocked of several rooms. I also decided to spend the night before my wedding there and all my bridesmaids and it was lovely....We got a free limo service to the church and reception site compliments of the hotel. My husband and I also stayed in the jacuzzi suite for our honeymoon and the hotel employee's made that a pleasurable stay also. I love the hotel and hope that they keep up the good work it's nice to have a hotel in the area so beautiful.
