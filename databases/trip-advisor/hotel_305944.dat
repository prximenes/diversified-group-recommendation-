<Content>good base The Empire hotel is an ideal place to stay, good location,ideal for holiday or business,rooms were average sized,a brand new bed was being installed as we arrived and was very comfortable.there are plenty of places to eat nearby,The White Stag does cheap lunches and the Boston restaurant does cheap breakfasts and great sizzling steaks.The HKCC is in walking distance on the covered walkway.The staff were very courtious and helpfull.There are some small faults as anywhere else after all you only sleep there as you should be out exploring this wonderfull city.

<Content>Decent room but poor food service The room was decent sized and looked clean. However, the mattress felt well due its time and was a bit uncomfortable. There also seemed to be a funny smell in the room. The bathtub felt a bit dirty as well. When we went for breakfast in the morning, we were only allowed for 1 although we were traveling with 2 plus a child. When left the restaurant for less than 5 minutes and realized we forgot our pacifier, we went back. And they told us no one saw it. It definitely left us a bad impression.

<Content>Very good base for Convention Centre The Empire was a very good base for a week long stay in Hong Kong. It is close to the Convention Centre, many restaurants and bars, and the ferry crossing to Kowloon. The rooms were not as small as I had been led to believe. The staff were unfailingly polite and pleasant.

<Content>good location, rooms are small and not very clean The location is quite good, to the nearest metro station it takes a 3 min walk only. Next to the hotel there are a lot of bars and restaurants. I disliked the smell when you enter the building and that the rooms are not very clean. There have a pool on the roof and a fitness center where you can relax after shopping or sightseeing. Anyway in case there would be a next time I would try another hotel.

<Content>Terrible, Rude The front desk staff are among the rudest people we've ever met. We knew this was an inexpensive hotel, so the mold in the room didn't both us that much. Nor did the mildew on the windows...nor the hard-as-a-rock bed...nor the airconditioning that couldn't be changed. But the obnoxious front desk is another story. Avoid, avoid, avoid. There are many other hotels in HK that will give you better value for money.

<Content>good stay, despite reviews My wife and i stayed in this hotel during the Chinese New Year. Despite the mostly negative reviews on this site, we still opted to book at the Empire.As we were bracing for the worst, much to our surprise, things were not that bad. Save for the small toilet and bath, our other expectations became positive. The staff were receptive and quite accommodating, the room itself was relatively comfortable, and the location is quite good.I guess it all boils down to personal preferences and tastes. But i would not hesitate to book at the Empire again.

<Content>Terrible Customer Service Stayed here over 30 times, for the location and used to have cheap rooms. Rooms of course tiny, but the bathroom is a closet. Have to go out to the main room to dry off after a shower. Always a few bruises from bumping into the bathroom walls. Bed is terrible; sink straight to the bottom, like sleeping in a hammock. No heat, so don鈥檛 go in winter. You can ask for a portable heater, but they will hassle you about it.But by far the worst part is the staff, which know nothing about how hotel hospitality is supposed to work. Only follow polices and are incapable of deviating from them. Never been greeted by name or offered any upgrade. Every time I ask for a 1 hour late checkout, I am flatly refused. Worse, they will lie to your face and tell you that they are fully booked the next day, when they have many rooms available. They have a 72 hour before 鈥榓rrival time鈥?cancel policy, but they will try to enforce a 72 hour 鈥榓rrival date鈥?(96 hours) policy. I spent an hour on the phone talking to 3 different 鈥榮upervisors鈥?before they canceled my reservation, even though they were fully booked for my dates and could easily get twice the rate I had reserved.They just don鈥檛 understand hotel customer service. I filled out the General Manager 鈥楥omment Form鈥?and requested that I be contacted, but never was - don鈥檛 think there is a GM. I now stay in a nearby hotel with upgrades, late checkout, nicer rooms, and cheaper rates.

<Content>Good location but otherwise below average by HK standards Great location on the edge of Wanchai near Pacific Place in Admiralty. It goes downhill from there. On first impression the hotel floors and carpets are quite worn throughout the property. My toilet was never totally cleaned. The bath curtain was very moldy and there was lots of other mold around the bath. The only soap provided was in dispensers, no bars of soap. The bed was both hard - like most Chinese beds - but also giving in some places. The control box for AC and lighting was not working, TV options were very limited. (CNN, BBC, Discovery + Chinese channels) They took away the dirty towels but did not replace them on my last day so I had to call for replacements. Internet HK$100 / day. I would still consider a return given its favorable price/location combination.

<Content>Good Value I arrived very early in the morning at the hotel, having travelled overnight from Sydney. In theory, I shouldnt have been allocated a room until later in the day, but I was in luck. No queues at reception either.Although I was allocated a non-smoking room, the aircon seemed to push the smoke around the building. The room was very clean and comfortable, with a view across the harbour.I had a drink in the bar at lunchtime. I was the only one there. I had a meal in the restaurant. Not full either. Both the service and food were first class.This hotel is well situated on Kowloon Island not too far from the Star Ferry and whilst not as visually spectacular as some local hotels (e.g The Langham where I have stayed before) this was considerably cheaper. I would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Good Hotel for a stay The room was pretty spacious for HK (friends living in HK where surprised about the size). Bathroom size was OK. Everything was very clean. The location is OK. I found Central more fun, but everything is very near because of the cheap taxis. The fitness room is a bit of a downer, there is not much equipment and the bit that's there is old. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel. There is a cafe across the street anyway.

<Content>You get what you pay for .... We staying in Hong Kong for 7 days - boy was that room teensie ... all the reviews had warned us - but it was still a surprise. The bathroom was ... ummm interesting - you could sit on the toilet - brush your teeth - and turn the shower on all from the one position!!!All in all we had no problems - it was really close to eateries, Knutsford Terrace and the MTR. The room wasn't overly noisey ... pool was a little 'scarey' so we only ventured there the once. Supermarket directly across the road (which we walked past for two days before we realised it!)Would stay again - we were there to get out and see the sights so it did the job for us - and was clean and tidy. :-)

<Content>Poor Service I was in Hong Kong for a weekend getaway in June and stayed for 3 nights at the Empire. The location was good - near to MTR and plenty of eateries nearby. There was a LCD TV and a mini fridge in the room, but the fridge was poorly maintained (chunks of ice covering the base of the fridge).The air-conditioning in the hotel lobby doesn't seem to be working as the area was warm and stuffy. On the first night, the housekeeper tried to barge into my room at 7am! Luckily he/she wasn't able to open the door with the access card because I had double-locked it from inside. But he/she was rather persistent and knocking the door for almost 10mins. On the next day of my stay, the housekeeper called my room phone at 7am and wanted to know when I am leaving so he can clean my room. I'm not sure why the housekeeper is so keen on cleaning my room, but it surely wasn't well done. Toiletries were not replenished, and the bathroom floor was not vacuumed at all (the same clump of hair was on the bathroom floor from my first day until the day I checked-out).On the whole, service was slow and minimal. I had to wait for 10mins for someone to attend to me for check-out. I definitely won't be staying in this hotel the next time I'm in Hong Kong.

<Content>My stay was okay for the NCLEX. last january 2006 I stayed for 3 days just to take my NCLEX-RN exam. the subway station at wanchai is just few blocks from there. it's a an OK place to stay for such short visits. If you are out all day, and just need a place to sleep at night then this place is good enough to satisfy that need. arriving from the airport, the staff were really quite accomodating. didnt greet us well, nor went with us to show our rooms. i stayed in a single room, not new but clean. but the view from my window is not a scenery (back of buildings). i didnt use the aircon because it was cold, the ammenities are fine. i could hear people the room across mine talkin (not a good thing for other travelers wanting a good sleep).what i am surprised was their cable service provider, which not only has LIMITED channels (and few english programs) BUT ADULT videos can be rented and showed directly on your TV costing around HKD135.00!!!other amenities like their pool was under construction as of that time. promotional pictures are so misleading. their reception area is in reality --just enough to accomodate 200 people standing!it's all up to you. butthe shops and stores, and diners are just nearby. it's along the red light districts so expect some bars and strolling performers along the way. the pool was under construction and that time.

<Content>very small rooms, staff with bad attitude Arrived at the hotel late afternoon,The reception Manager issued me with a room, I explained to the Manager that the room provided was very small and unacceptable as I had booked a delux room. I was informed that as I had booked via a web site the problem was with the agency not the hotel. I requsted an upgrade for which I was willing to pay, again I was informed contact your agency there can be no upgrade.Although I spoke to the hotel personally and emailed them before traveling it counted for nothing. Both the steam room/ sauna were not working and the pool was ice cold (unheated).The price for breakfast was 150HK$,the same meal was 23HK$ across the road from the hotel,The location of the hotel is very good and central to Nathan Road and the MTR.There are many hotels close to Nathan Road, I would suggest booking one of those,

<Content>Small but well-facilitated i was quite skceptical of this hotel initially: run-down super small size room with minimal facilities. BUT apparently not. No doubt the room is small, the size of the room is quite similar to that of the robertson hotel in Singapore. I am not able to capture a full image of the whole room at any angle with my camera. Let me describe the things i am seeing here (I am still in the midst of my stay in this hotel), queen size bed, flat screen tv, safe deposit, internet access plug for your laptop (a fee is required for the usage though), hot water facilities, mini fridge and hair dryer! (it is a hidden treasure which i found by accident=D) In short, I have what i want so it is great! btw, im staying here for 6 days 5 nights, one person. Not much free 'running' space but not cramp either. As for the exterior, do not expect any scenery view. Location wise, it is accessible to Wanchai MTR, food, convenience stores, supermarkets, pubs, convention centre. Staff are friendly and helpful with my simple requests. In addition, they have a nice comfortable pool and a gym at the top. Small but it is sufficient for relaxation purposes.

<Content>Good and Bad This hotel have been in the middle of some kind of renovation when we stayed. The first room we were assigned was very old, dirty and rundown. Since the shower did not work right, we asked for a different room. The second room was very modern and clean; nothing fancy mind you, but about what I expected for the money. Night and day difference between the two rooms. So if you stay, be sure to ask for one of these renovated rooms.

My room was great - new renovations - clean simple modern look. Comfortable - great value for money! Would recommend it to anyone.

<Content> Watch Out! Health Hazard! What A Nightmare. Extremely tired and old premises. Smoky rooms even on non smoking floor. Bathroom damp and unsanitary. Air con vents blocked by dust. Aircon reeked of stale cigarette smoke and faecal smell. Dirty walls and bed. Terrible terrible. It was a NIGHTMARE. Walls too thin. Loud mouth chinese mainlander guests' conversations go on throught the night in their hotel rooms. Couldn't get sleep. Woke up with painful chest, probably due to smoke particles in aircon. I am traumatised. Difficult to have ashower in cramped bathroom. PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE. I AM NOT KIDDING YOU. I am cringing even as I write this.

<Content>basic and smoky We recently stayed 5 nights over New Year. I was dissapointed with the hotel. Despite booking for non-smoking rooms we were first given smoking ones then after requesting to change even one of the non-smoking rooms reeked of stale smoke. We were upgraded to a suite which was a room with a sofa. The heating was broken and a fan heater provided which itself broke down.The sound proofing between rooms was minimal.We went out each day sight seeing. It is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest train station down and over a busy road. I wouldn't recommend this hotel.
