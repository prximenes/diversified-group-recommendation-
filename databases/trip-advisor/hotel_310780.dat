<Content>My favourite I stayed with my family at Hotel Europa last October whilst visiting Italy. My mother had stayed here before and wanted to come back. She was right- this was a wonderful hotel :)Miriam and Gasim were SO nice, nothing was ever too much trouble for them and they always had a smile on their faces.I felt really welcome there.On one occasion, my father and I were chatting to Miriam and it stuck in my mind how lovely she was!!The hotel rooms were beautiful - just as good as some of the museums that you pay to visit, yet I had it all in my own hotel room.IThe Europa is conveniently located; walking distance from the main attractions and five minutes from the duomo.I would strongly reccommend staying at this hotel and I will certainly stay there again when I next visit Florence.Ally aged 15

<Content>A gem of a hotel in a beautiful city! This was a fantastic hotel! The location COULD NOT have been any better - everything was in walking distance and for a first-timer to Florence it made my trip flawless.The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and were excellent at providing a great level of service and helpful advice.I fell in love with Florence and my short stay left me hungry for more! I would highly recommend this hotel for its prime location, clean, comfortable rooms and extremely pleasant owners and staff.

<Content>Great Location, friendly staff! This hotel was perfect for our short stay in Florence, the staff at the hotel were very friendly, and nothing was a problem when it came to helping us. The hotel is in a fantastic location, within walking distance to everything. My first impressions were not great (very small lift to get up to lobby) but was not dissapointed from the time we arrived - everything else was great. Clean  large rooms  great breakfast was included.Cant beat it for the price!

<Content>Fabulous Location -- Great Family! Great hotel in a fabulous location. No need for rental car -- Duomo is at end of street and Uffizi is 15 minute walk. Gassim, Maria, Miriam and Robert went above and beyond, caring for me when I became ill and treating my daughter and me as family. On top of serving the best cappucino in Florence, they also provide a simple, but adequate breakfast in a very cute breakfast room. Expect great concierge service to meet your needs; warm, friendly smiles; and a genuine caring attitude.The renovated rooms are cozy -- make sure you request a renovated room! The new mattresses are comfortable. The bathrooms are small, but meet the needs. Flat screen tvs broadcast three English-speaking news channels, in addition to Italian and French broadcasts. Everything is spotless and cleaned daily.The elevator is typically European, small and awkward -- tho it meets the needs. We tended to use the stairs.Bottom line, staying here is like staying with family with all the benefits and none of the hassles. And the price couldn't be beat!I would absolutely stay here again.Thanks Gasim, Maria, Miriam and Robert!!

<Content>Absolutely wonderful! It is the best experience I have had so far. Hotel Europa, is truly breath taking, It was like you were staying at an ancient Castle. The Hotel, is close to everything and central to all of the Museums and the night life. We saved a lot on transportation, because, everything is accessable by foot. The family that owns it, treats everyone like a long lost family member, and they truly do everything to accomodate and look after you.I will miss Maria, Qassim and Miriam and Robert!I am going back, I can`t wait!

<Content>Service with a Smile I cannot say enough good things about the service I received from the Hotel Europa staff (especially Gasim  Miriam). They went above and beyond in making me feel welcome (and helping me improve my Italian), as well as helping me out when a snap transport strike disrupted my travel plans. The hotel rooms were neat, tidy and cleaned daily, the breakfast options were plentiful, and the location couldn't be faulted (right in the centre of things!).

<Content>Felt like a guest of the family This wonderful hotel with his friendly host was a great treat after some difficulties in Rome. Gassim is the owner, and greeted us at all hours with a smile, and by first name. He works tirelessly, at midnight, and then with gusto at breakfast early. The rooms are very clean, and have adorable painted furniture. We had a great courtyard room. Mosquitos are a problem in Florence, and there were plug-ins in the drawers which we found the next day. Our shower leaked out onto the floor, but everything in it looked brand new. We'd love to come stay here again! thanks ,Gassim!

<Content>Great hotel , great location Stayed for three nights at Hotel Europa, and what impressed us most were the hosts Miriam and Robert, they are a great couple and are very welcoming and helpful with advice on activities, restaurants, shopping. The hotel is an excellent location very central to the Duomo, markets, railway station and all attractions that beautiful Florence has to offer. Rooms are spacious and very clean and the breakfast was adequate. Would stay here again.

<Content>Encapsulates the heart of Florence We spent a few days here at the end of October to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't have picked a nicer spot. We fell in love with Florence and also with this hotel which, for us, encapsulated the heart of this beautiful city with its relaxed elegance and warm spirit. We had a very 'Florentine' room with a view' and a great bed, the best of friendly attention from our hosts, a good breakfast and a super location. In the grim early- winter days which are fast enveloping the North of Ireland, we think about our 'time out' in this little Florentine idyll all the time and hope some day to return. Thanks for everything. [---]

<Content>Friendly clean family run hotel What do you want in a hotel? 1. value 2. location 3.cleanliness 4.attentive staff i look for this first usually will never find it however this hotel provides it all along with a warm and friendly family approach. if you prefer a large impressive lobby with uniformed business like staff in a big box hotel this is not your place. but if you want a great room at a great price in a central location run by a dedicated family this definitely is your place in florence

<Content>stolen moments! We decided to take a very last minute holiday in Tuscany - doing it on a 'let's busk it as we go' approach [not like us at all!]The whole week was fantastic, with our 3 days/nights in Florence undoubtedly a highlight.We booked Hotel Europa though www.venere.com - and werenot disappointed in any way. We were expected and welcomed.The position of the hotel made it verey easy to explore - and we felt right at the heart of the city. The room was good, with our every request accomodated with a smile.We hope to be back.

<Content>Wonderful experience A truly wonderful experience. This family owned hotel is in the heart of Florence, close to everything but when I walked through their doors I felt at home. There's no noise of the city and I had a great patio and view of the Duomo. Miriam and her family made me feel at home from the start. They made reservations for me, recommendations and took care of me while in their hotel. I would never consider staying anywhere else in Florence so long as there's a room at the Europa.

<Content>Great location, great hosts Hotel Europa is so close to everything - walking distance to the Duomo, Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio, Accademia and other attractions. Robert and Miriam were so helpful in making reservations for us including finding us a driver to take us to the wine country. They are lovely and gracious hosts! The rooms are large and comfortable.

<Content>A little piece of Old Florence My husband and I stayed at the Europa Hotel for 11 days in early October. We chose the hotel based on location, size and Trip Adviser reviews, which were very accurate. The location simply cannot be beat - one can walk everywhere. We wanted a small hotel which would provide somewhat the feel of living in Florence. Europa made that possible. Our room, the Dante, had the feel of old Tuscany and was large, airy and light (two large windows) and super clean. Loved the church bells. Miriam and Robert, the managers (Miriam's father owns the hotel), did everything possible to make us feel like family - not strangers while never being intrusive. We had e-mailed the hotel to make reservations and their response was immediate and informative. They also made reservations for us at the Accademia, Uffizi (which they canceled and re-made when we were not feeling well) and the Brancacci Chapel and when we arrived they greeted us like old friends.This was my third trip to Florence and I had a long list of places I wanted to visit and spend time. Shortly after our arrival, my husband and I picked up some kind of intestinal virus and Miriam was wonderful! Made hot tea for us while she contacted an English doctor nearby who saw us immediately and prescribed medication that allowed us to do all that we wanted to without any sick days. She and her husband Robert also saw to it that our every comfort need was immediately met. Our daughter and her husband joined us there after our first week, and when they arrived Miriam seemed as glad to see them as we were and brought us all fresh fruit juice. When we left, she gave us all wine and Biscotti! Delicious!The breakfast was more than adequate. The small elevator was surprisingly sturdy and dependable (my husband, an engineer, was intrigued by it!) The room quiet, the bathroom spotless and large, and living in the San Marco/Medici Palace area a joy.I highly recommend the Europa to anyone who wants a piece of old Florence while visiting friends

<Content>Yes We have spent 7 weeks visiting 5 countries in Europe. This would definitely have to be one of the best hotels we stayed in. We are an active couple in our mid fifties, and were able to walk from the railway station to the hotel - took about 15 minutes with each of us towing a large suitcase.(over the narrow footpaths, with the cobblestone paving a little restricting). Everything we wanted to do or see was within very easy walking distance of the hotel.The couple who were managing the hotel during our stay (part of an extended family ownership) were SO pleasant and helpful. They recommended great restaurants for the two evenings we were in Florence. Our room was spacious, neat and tidy (we think it may have been recently renovated) - the bathroom lovely although the shower cubicle a bit small (seems to be the norm in Europe). And our room looked out to the dome of the Duomo just 150 metres away - woke to the sound of the bells tolling in the morning.Bonus for us was being shown the decorated (14th century?) ceilings in the owner's private rooms.We definitely recommend this hotel, and would stay there again. .

<Content>Wonderful Experience I booked the Hotel Europa based on TripAdvisor reviews and I was not disappointed. I would go back in a heart beat. The hotel is about 4 blocks from the Duomo and everything else in Florence, but far enough away from the mass of tourists and tour buses. The managers are wonderful and go out of their way to make your time in Florence memorable. My room was huge and looked out over a courtyard. The dome of the Duomo was right outside my window and the bells rang every morning. Breakfast was typically European and there were cappuccinos and espresso every morning. I look forward to my next trip back.

<Content>Friendly in Florence My husband and I stayed at Hotel Europa on October 10, 2008 and brought friends back for a stay on October 18. The hotel is lovely with clean, spacious, quiet rooms. The newly remodeled rooms are the best choice. The owners, Miriam and Robert, are helpful in every way - our new friends in Florence. Miriam made reservations for us at the Uffizi and Academia. I would definitely return to Hotel Europa.

<Content>Great stay and location We stayed in a large, very clean and quiet room. Miriam and Robert were very friendly and helpful. They made us restaurant reservations, booked tours and museums for us. The breakfast room was cheerful and they were there to welcome you. The only suggestion would be to have a toaster and fresh fruit for breakfast. We found the location excellent within walking distance to most attractions, shopping and restaurants. We enjoyed our stay, felt safe at night and would stay with them again should we come back to Florence.

It was cleaned to a very good standard and had everything required. Miriam and Robert were extremely nice and very helpful with finding good places to go during our stay in Italy. I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone, the price was very reasonable and delighted with the service provided :)

<Content>A Wonderful Place to Stay My husband and I stayed in this hotel during our holiday through Italy and had a wonderful stay at Hotel Europa. The rooms are clean, spacious and well maintained. The staff are incredibly helpful, polite and friendly. And honestly, you couldn't ask for a better location in Florence.I booked this hotel based solely on the reviews on Tripadvisor and I was so pleased with the results. The reviews were spot on. We don't have anything negative to say about this hotel. I think what made it so wonderful though, is the people that run this hotel. They did everything they could to make our short stay in Florence easy and enjoyable. Thank you to all of the staff at Hotel Europa for making our stay in Florence so memorable.

<Content>The Best Hotel in Florence We visited the Hotel Europa for the 2nd time in the last 2 years this Sept. We could hardly wait to go back to this hotel as we had such a wonderful experience 2 years ago. We were not disappointed. This hotel is steps away from the Duomo and a short walk to the Ponte Vecchio and many delicious restaurants. It is a quiet hotel despite being on a main street, as almost all the rooms face toward an inner courtyard. Peaceful and relaxing. The one aspect, however, that sets this hotel apart is the family who own it. Gassim, Mary, Miriam, and Robert are exceptional and for us, the Hotel Europa is the only hotel in Florence that we will stay at.Vancouver, Canada

<Content>Great Experience! We stayed at the Hotel Europa for three evenings during our trip to Italy. Nader welcomed us and showed us to our well appointed  very clean room. We really enjoyed staying at the hotel, with a great location, tasty breakfest (Nader made me cappuccinos every day) and comfy room. We would both highly recommend this hotel, espeically with the great price. (Contact directly and pay in cash).

<Content>Fab Location My mum and I stayed at the hotel for two nights in September 2008. It was really easy to find with us walking from the train station and it was incrediably close to the Duomo and other attractions. The hoteliers are very friendly, speak perfect English (as my Italian consists of 50 words at the moment!) and are really helpful.The rooms were very traditional, large, comfortable and clean. Breakfast was perfectly adequate and a good opportunity to talk to other guests. The whole trip was great with Florence being a gorgeous city and the hotel being a very convenient and pleasant place to stay.

<Content>Great Location; Friendly Folks! We needed a room for one night in Florence, before meeting friends for a week's stay in a villa, elsewhere in Tuscany. The Eruopa fit the bill perfectly. On a very hot day, the air conditioning worked perfectly. The bed was comfortable, and we had a nice view from our window of the hotel's inner courtyard with the dome of the Duomo and the campanile in the background. Nader at the front desk was very friendly, as was the proprietor who we spoke with at breakfast. Breakfast was more than just coffee and a hard roll; it included cereal, yogurt, fresh squeezed juice, breads, and hard boiled eggs. We paid 100 euro, and I doubt that these days, you could get more for your money in Florence.The only downside is that the hotel is a not-so-direct 15 minute walk from Santa Maria Novella, Florence's train station; but it is five minutes from the Duomo, the Baptistry and two minutes from San Lorenzo and the San Lorenzo Market.

<Content>Very friendly staff I can understand why there are so many good reviews for this hotel. The hotel itself is in a good location-close enough to the touristy things without being on a noisy street. The rooms are large and clean. However, the thing that sets this hotel apart from others is the staff. They go out of their way to do everything to make your stay wonderful. They had no problem at all booking reservations for us. From the minute we got in (late at night), the staff impressed us. The gentlemen at the front desk greeted us with cold bottled water-which was well appreciated on a hot, August night. The staff was extremely understanding at check out and honored all of our requests. They are all very good people and run a nice, family business. We got the hotel for a good rate and would go back. For the price, this hotel is great. If you will be touring Florence and need a clean, comfortable room to stay in, I would recommend it. For people looking for a luxury hotel with a lot of amenities, remember, this is only a 2 star hotel, so it may not be right for you. For us, the hotel suited our needs and offered a basic breakfast and free wifi, which came in handy. Thank you for a wonderful stay.

<Content>I love this place!!! I love this hotel. The staff are wonderful. I have been coming to this hotel every year for 10 years now. The location is wonderful- 2 blocks to the Duomo. They recently remodeled and it is very nice. The rooms are comfortable and have air conditioning. All new bathrooms. The breakfast room is comfortable and they offer a typical Italian breakfast. It is family run and I always look forward to my visit to Hotel Europa. Thank you again for a wonderful stay.

<Content>Wonderful!! We stayed at the Hotel Europa for three nights in the beginning of July and thought it was wonderful. It was definitely in a great location and if you do not have a lot of luggage, it is easily within walking distance from the train station. The rooms were spacious and very clean. The best part was getting to know Miriam and Robert, they were the greatest hosts! We emailed them directly to book the hotel and they always responded promptly. They were so helpful- they made our museum reservations for us (highly recommended for the Uffizi and Accademia) and dinner reservations as well. Overall, it was a great experience and we will absolutely stay here again when we return to Florence!!

<Content>First class choice Apologies for this very late review. We have stayed in Florence before but for value for money and friendliness this hotel beats all. Very conveniently situated, family-run hotel. The family were extremely friendly and went out of their way to help. It was a special birthday when we were there and they even gave me a present - astonishing - I was very touched, thank you. The room was large and airy as was the bathroom, everything spotless. Would definitely recommend this hotel to all. The only slight downside is the limited choice of breakfast but that shouldn't stop anyone staying in this excellent hotel.Sandra and Nick Osmond

<Content>Top Hotel! What charm and service!We booked this hotel based on reviews already on trip advisor, we were not disappointed! The service was superb; we were greeted with a smile on arrival ;a bottle of ice cold water and to top it all a room with the veiw of the Duomo! I loved the lift, it made me feel I was in an episode of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot!The breakfast was good and served with a friendly charm. The position of the hotel is brilliant within close distance of all the sights.The hotel was an oasis of peace in a busy, vibrant and fun city. We will be back. I can't wait!

<Content>Great Hospitality Had the pleasure of staying here with my family, 3 rooms, earlier this year. All rooms were large, clean and comfortable and very centrally located down the street from the Duomo. Breakfast was simple, but adequate. The great joy of staying here. though, is in the hospitality of the hoteliers Mariam, her father and her husband Robert. From the moment we arrived until our departure, they were eager to meet any need we might have. They are genuinely good people and just comforting to be around.

<Content>Wonderful hotel in Florence We stayed at the Europa on two separate nights in July. Miriam and Robert are wonderfully friendly, helpful, and gracious hosts. The hotel is centrally located, two blocks north of the Duomo. It was easy to walk to all the sights in Florence. The room was large, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was very spacious. As we were traveling by train to Cinque Terre, Miriam kept our larger suitcases until we returned a week later. We were given a different room, equally as lovely. Old frescoes on the walls, lovely painted furniture, very good breakfast. Miriam was very helpful in getting my medication from the local pharmacy-even offered to walk with me to translate my needs. I would definitely stay there again and recommend this hotel to all.

<Content>my favorite I found Hotel Europa in a book entitled cheap hotels--the word cheap got me interested but the writer and her photos did not do justice to what might be, as my review's title suggests, my favorite hotel. ever. The hotel is located on the first and second floors of a beautiful old building on Via Cavour, across from the Medici Pallazzo. Supposedly the building has, at different points in its history, been a convent, a finishing school, and palace bought by Franz Liszt for his mistress. The rooms are bright and unusually large, and many have lovely, cracking frescoes painted on the ceiling. The bathrooms are also roomy, and most have bidet's. It's a short walk from the Duomo, which one can see from several of the rooms' windows. There are also several tourism offices on the street so the area is quite practical.Hotel Europa is staffed by a lovely multi-lingual family, who can offer great sightseeing advice and make a fantastic breakfast, and generally do an excellent job of making one feel welcome and comfortable. Rarely is such efficiency paired with such warmth. Bravo!

<Content>Best Hotel in Florence!!! This review is way long overdue!!!Florence, Italy is one of the most beautiful places I've ever travelled to. Every inch and square of this magnificent city is filled with such beautiful things and unforgettable landscapes. One of the things that made our trip so fantastic was our stay at Hotel Europa.Hotel Europa is not just a hotel; it is an experience. Waking up to the sounds of the bell ringing from the tower of the Duomo was pretty special. The cheerful greetings from the hoteliers (which words cannot express how lovely they are) every morning and night, made you feel like you were right at home. The rooms embodied a touch of romance; the hand painted furniture and the great windows that opened to the view of the top of Duomo. And with all that, the rates were reasonable. And if location is a concern, this hotel is smack dab in the middle of everything; only minutes away to all the historical sites!I would recommend this hotel to anyone. If ever I get the chance to go back to Florence, I would definitely stay at the Hotel Europa! G + R

<Content>So warm and welcoming No matter how hot the day was, it couldn鈥檛 have been any warmer than our welcome at Hotel Europa Firenze. Miriam welcomed us by name saying how much she was looking forward to meeting us because she thought she already knew us from our emails. Within minutes, we thought that we already knew her too. Friends in minutes.It wouldn鈥檛 have mattered what the room was like after that but the room was great. Our room, No 47, a newly renovated double superior room had a nice, big, comfortable bed, big TV, modern though small bathroom and a balcony with a view to the Duomo. Breakfast was ample and varied, coffee was hot and how we liked it. The breakfast room also had an internet computer. We had asked Miriam to pre book us tickets for the Uffizi and the Accademia and of course, our Reservation numbers were waiting for us. This is a must. No waiting in lines for us! Miriam also gave us some great restaurant suggestions.The hotel is situated a couple minutes from the Duomo, on Via Cavour and just around the corner from the Galleria Dell鈥橝ccademia making it very central. It was undergoing renovations whilst we were there not that we were bothered by noise at all and was due to be completed by the end of June. We would definitely return to see how it turned out and would love to see Miriam again.

<Content>Excellent hospitality My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel Europa for three nights on our honeymoon. Of the 4 places we stayed at in Italy, Hotel Europa had the best service of all of them by far. When we checked in, they gave us a large bottle of ice cold water and upgraded our room to a larger room free of charge. The beds were a little on the hard side but I know some people prefer harder beds. The rooms were very neat and cleaned daily. Breakfast was simple but the cappucinos were great. Miriam was very helpful and called both the Uffizi and the Accademia for us to make reservations. The hotel was centrally located and a short walk to most sites. Lastly, we were given a bottle of chianti wine when we checked out as a gift for staying with them on our honeymoon. I thought this was a real special touch to our stay.

<Content>Friendliest staff we've ever met We just returned from an 8 day stay at the Hotel Europa in Florence. The best part of the hotel was the family who runs it. They were so helpful with everything, from restaurant suggestions to booking museum visits and tours. We were greeted with a smile and wonderful coffee, cappuccino and croissants each morning at breakfast, which is included. They even gave us a gift when we left, and I have never had that happen before!  The location of the hotel is perfect. It is right in the center of town, all of the main attractions of Florence are within walking distance, such as museums, churches, and shopping.  After a week in an apartment in Rome, the amenities of the Hotel Europa were a welcome change. The air conditioning worked fabulously! The hotel is kept very clean, and the maid service each day was very nice. Also, unlike many European hotels, there is an elevator, which is convenient for all of your luggage, and your tired legs after a long day of walking! The price of this hotel is very reasonable, especially for how nice it is! We would highly recommend it, and would stay there again if we returned to Florence

<Content>Liked this Hotel! Our family of 5 stayed one Friday night in June and the experience was great. We were upgraded to a bigger room when we arrived (without even asking) that was right next to the breakfast room. It was very nice with beautiful frescoes painted on the ceiling. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were meeting friends in Florence and they ended up helping them with cabs, recommendations, etc. too. The location to the points of interest was good, the closest being the Duomo. I would definately stay here if we pass through Florence again.

<Content>Excellent for budget traveller This hotel is perfect for those on a budget. The location is perfect and service was over the top. The front desk was one of the best we have ever encountered. They worked their tails off to make sure everything was perfect and that we felt as if we were guests in their home.The amenities were sparse (No lobby bar, stark entrance, minimal breakfast), but if not important to you, this is the place to stay.Very clean and safe. Within 5 minutes of the wold's cultural icons.I'd go back!

<Content>Room with an almost View We visited Firenze and stayed at Hotel Europa 3 days in July 2008.The hotel is situatet on a road with a high traffic volume very close to the Dome, which is excellent if one wish to feel the pulse in the center of Firenze. Our room had a nice view to a backyard with treas and rooftops as well as the sound of the bell towers (positive), otherwise the room (and the hotel as a whole) where really quiet.Our double room where large and clean (no bedbugs). The cleaning of the room, making the bed and changing of towels where made on a daily basis.The staff/owners where very kind and did everything to make our stay as comfortable and easy as possible.The price for the room where very reasonable but included a breakfast which we felt could be a lot better (if added some fresh fruit, better cheese (local ?) proper ham (etc) and proper service instead of plasticcups.All in all we recommend Hotel Europa to all who wish to have a pleasent stay in Firenze, Italy

<Content>Truly, a home away from home What a wonderful hotel ! We arrived on the first day of a major heatwave without our luggage which was left behind in Paris by Air France. Miriam was such a gracious host. Since we were exhausted and hot, she provided a triple room before the normal checkin time. The room was large with high ceilings with large beds. The only negative was that the air conditioning didn't work. So , after a nap, we changed rooms to one of the newly renovated room a floor above. Miriam was welcoming and let us move to the new room. Thankfully, the air conditioning was new and fantastic. the view from the window was of a backyard garden and parking area with the duomo in the background, birds flying all around. Flat screen TV and wireless made the entry into Florence easy.Miriam's husband and her father Gassim are exceptional Hoteliers. They speak english perfectly and are very helpful and guide guests to some of the best places in Florence.Miriam called Air france for me and our bags appeared late the first day. According to her, we were the first in many years to get our bags the first day.Breakfasts are fine. An espresso machine that makes great Capuccino, fruit, yogurts, pastries, boiled eggs, cold cuts and cheese make it easy to get energized for the day. The hotel is right around the corner from the Accademia and Michelangelo's David, two blocks from the Duomo and two blocks from the Central market - a must see in florence. We can recommend a few places to eat- ZaZa in the central market square where i had some of the best pasta with clams and a tuscan rosato at a reasonable price. Da Mario, next door to ZaZa is only open for lunch and is one of the few old style florentine restaurants. You sit at a table with others, the waiter comes by and tells you what is left on the menu and you eat amazing fresh food in a friendly convivial atmosphere. Get there early or there won't be much left on the menu. I can't give the Hotel Europa a higher review and thanks. they made our stay in Florence like staying with friends.

<Content>Pleasant Stay, Great Hosts My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Europa the first week of June 2008 for 4 days and loved every minute of it. It was a short walk from the train station but it was a little difficult wheeling our luggage on the streets. Upon arrival, we were a little confused and could not find the front desk due to the construcion. There was a construcion worked that told us it was one more floor up, so up we went. The hosts were absolutely wonderful and very helpful in every way. I can not say enough kind words about how well and respected we were treated. We were shown to our Superior Room which was great. Very clean and spacious. We loved the Tuscan decor and tile floors. The bathroom was spacious and they have best hairdryers then any other hotel we stayed in during our trip to Italy. The air conditioning worked great, almost too good, it did get a little too chilly in the room during the night. Nothing a little adjusting couldn't fix.Breakfast was included in the price and was just perfect to get our day of sightseeing going. It was a buffet style that included croissants, cereal, bread, ham, cheese, yogurt, etc. The location was just perfect, we were able to walk everywhere with no problems at all. Only 5 min. to the Duomo, 15 min. to the Uffizi and Arno. We e-mailed the hotel prior to our visit to make reservations for us at the Academia and they sure came through, thank you again for all your help. I highly recommend the Hotel Europa, its well maintained, great value and excellenet service. We would definitely stay here again. On our departure, Gassim called us a taxi, which arrived in like 2 min. and even helped bring our luggage to the taxi. He was just too helpful.I do have to mention, if your looking for a great place for dinner, Aqua Al 2 was fantastic. We just happened to stumble upon it and what a great find. The food was outsanding and the wine was superb. Make reservations or go early, this place got packed.

<Content>Wonderful hotel and kind owners I can't say enough good things about Miriam and her helpful dad. Before our arrival, I email Miriam with questions related to sightseeing and museum reservation. She replied promptly with suggestion. We were not disappointed when we arrived at the hotel. From the moment we walked in to the time we left, the family treated us with kindness, and always helps with a smile on their face. The room we had is spacious, clean and modern. The hotel location is superb. The breakfast was great with fruit, meat, cheese, bread, yoghurt, and cereal. I just would not find any fault in this hotel. The hotel rate it 2 stars, but the overall deserve 5 stars.I will not consider any other hotel except this one if we go back to Florence again.Miriam, maybe one day our daughters can play music at your hotel's dinning room together.

<Content>Good value The Europa is a pretty good hotel. We got into a deathtrap of an elevator to ascend to the second floor, where upon check-in the man behind the desk asked for our passports, then told us he'd show us our room -- while leaving the passports on his desk. We were a bit unnerved by this, so we asked if we could stay while he took our information, but he refused this and started walking towards our room anyway. We followed him, then returned to the desk, where he copied all of our information and asked me to sign a sheet in Italian. We asked what it was for, and he simply said, For terrorism. You register with the police. Then, a sarcastic sorry. Not the warmest of welcomes!As it turned out, he was a nice man, but was very set in his ways and didn't like to be questioned. He did let us hang out in the lobby for a few hours after our checkout before we took a train out of town, and he even brought us bottles of water.Anyway, the location of this hotel is superb. Five minutes to the Duomo, ten to the Uffizi and the Arno, ten to Santa Maria Novella train station.Our room was nice and spacious. The decoration is nice, very Tuscan. Our window opened up to a quiet courtyard. Unfortunately, our TV was so old it didn't turn on, the windows had no screens (so we suffered through mosquito infestations), and the bed was not very comfortable.The bathroom was okay -- the shower inexplicably sprayed out into the center of the bathroom and blew through the non-waterproof shower curtain. This resulted in a huge puddle in the middle of the bathroom, and the shower could not be adjusted. The bathroom was, however, a good size.Breakfast was okay -- croissants, bread, yogurt, and fruit -- and was included. The meal is served in a charming room with a reproduction of Boticcelli's The Birth of Venus on the wall.Bottom line: the Europa is a value stay with good service. If you only want to spend 100-150 euros, consider the Europa for its location -- but don't expect the amenities to blow your mind.

<Content>A Wonderful Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Europa for four nights in mid-May 2008. It is a wonderful hotel two blocks from the Duomo with a lobby, breakfast and guest rooms on the first (not ground) floor and the remaining guest rooms on the second floor. They are in the process of building a new lobby on the second floor. The breakfast buffet was fresh, tasty and on par with the other Italy hotels we stayed at.Our room, #47, was reasonably sized, comfortable and faced a quiet courtyard. It had a modern theme, with beige stucco walls and a tile floor. Amenities included a large comfortable queen bed, two safes (one large enough for a notebook), wall mounted 30 plus inch LCD TV, refrigerator, in room wireless internet (free, but in six hour increments). The bathroom was small, but easily accessible.For an extra 10e per night, this room included a balcony with a wonderful view of the Duomo. Unfortunately, it rained every day there and we never got to use it. Along with this, the humidity hatched an extra supply of mosquitoes, so opening the (non-screened) doors to the balcony was out. Another issue was that the balcony had another set of entry doors from the hall outside our room, so one day we came back to find another couple sitting on our (private?) balcony. I鈥檓 sure the balcony would be great under the right circumstances, but it didn鈥檛 work for us.Miriam and Gassim were charming and knowledgeable hosts, providing everything from museum reservations to touring information with ease. While dining is very subjective, we found a row of restaurants two blocks from the hotel on Borgo San Lorenzo that each offered very tasty and affordable touristico specials. In summary, we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Europa and would not hesitate to return. It is in a very good location, quiet, well maintained and an excellent value for the price we paid.

<Content>Excellent choice I picked this hotel based on good reviews on Tripadvisor and I was not disappointed.Firstly, the location was excellent - about 10-15 mins walk from the train station and close to all major sites. Duomo/Academia were only 5 mins away, Uffizi 10 mins. Plenty of amenities around: cafes, restaurants, laundromat, supermarket, etc. While the hotel is on a main street, our room (called 'Michelangelo') was facing a courtyard and was very quite. Secondly, the room was spacious and clean. Nice to have a tiled floor for a change! We liked the florentine furniture, very elegant. Thirdly, the guy who welcomed us to the hotel was excellent, a gentleman - forever polite and could not do enough for the guests. We arrived early in the morning(i.e. before check-in time), he let us deposit our bags and made us two cappaccinos before we set off signtseeing.

<Content>A Perfect Honeymoon! This was our 1st trio to Florence. We had an amazing time in such a beautiful city. When we arrived we were shown to our room by Miriam, who returned shortly afterwards with a cool drink of juice and a map, she explained all the best places to go. ALl of the staff at the Europa are friendly and will help you in anyway that they can. Miriam told us about Za Za's restaurent and it was the best one that we visited, entirely reasonable with amazing food. Would recommend the wine tasting tour through walking tours as it was great and you get to see so much. Our hotel room had a fantastic view of the Duomo as we had opted to pay more for a room with a balcony, lovely to sit out at with a glass of wine after a long day of sightseeing. Hotel was clean and well kept. Breakfast was fairly basic, ham, cheese, bread, crossiants and cereal but the coffee was fab. Would definalty go back to Florence and pay another visit to the hotel Europa!

<Content>Well-located Hotel Europa We visited Hotel Europa in late May 2008 as part of our first trip to Florence. It was my goal to book a comfortable hotel at a good price, but I was not looking for budget-type accomodations. Here is the quick version of our review:PROS:* Great location just a couple of blocks from the Duomo, and across the street from the lovely Medici-Ricardi musuem* Recently upgraded rooms* Our room had a view of the top of the Duomo and charming residences surrounding the hotel* Bed was comfortable, while not plush* Very helpful staff - seems to be family-run, and they were eager to do anything to pleaseCons* Room decor, while new, was very utilitarian and not particularly attractive* Shower was ridiculously small, bumped elbows a million times against the door* No counter space in bathroom* Staff left the window open and my boyfriend was eaten alive by mosquitos - don't leave the windows open, no matter what!* Very limited breakfast selection - cereal, mortadellaOverall, Hotel Europa was an okay hotel - it didn't add to or detract from our wonderful Florence experience. Frankly, Florence is so fabulous that it really doesn't matter where you stay!

<Content>Great find We were taking a short break in Florence to see as much of the famous sites as we could in a short time. This hotel was just perfect, centrally located, easy for walking about with eateries close at hand. Many of the sites of interest are 2-5mins away (even a book shop selling english books). We could pop back for a rest when the feet needed a break. There was a fridge in the room for cold drinks/picnic food and the bathroom was newly refurbished, clean and well equipped and there was constant hot water. Our room was spacious and we had a view of the Duomo. The hotel is family run and we received a warm welcome and brilliant service. English is spoken. Free internet connection was a bonus as was the loan of a bottle opener! Renovation work was going on on the ground floor, and the second, so keeping the place clean and keeping it running efficiently must have been a headache but they did it. The place was spotless. The only possible downside was that it was a bit noisier in the the day because of the work (a temporary problem) and the breakfast room is disrupted. The temporary accomodation is a little cramped with no natural light and the choice of food is adequate but would benefit from the addition of fruit and some whole grain bread/crackers. This is a city hotel so don't expect the garden or the pool but do expect an oasis in the middle of a busy city. It is run by people who have travelled and who care for the comfort and happiness of their guests. Nothing is too much trouble.

<Content>Comfortable and Pleasant Stay Hotel Europa in Florence was a good option we had picked for ourselves for our 2 day stay at Florence. Very clean beds, toilets(recently renovated hotel), friendly English speaking staff, decent breakfast spread. Located quite close to the Academia and not far away from the Church and Uffizi. The rail station is a few bus stops away, but easily approachable. Reasonable priced, and we got ourselves a good deal. The Turkish restaurant opposite the hotel is a blessing for travellers from the Orient as they serve curry and rice.

<Content>Fantastic stay in every way My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights; it is fantastic. It is family operated and they treat their guests like family. The room was clean and recently renovated, but most importantly, it was quiet although it is situated only minutes from the Duomo and David. Breakfast is fine, nothing fancy. Wonderful location for sightseeing and the bus/train terminal. They gave discount for payment in cash. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Location for Sightseeing This hotel has a perfect location for walking to all the important sights.We had a very large, quiet room with high ceilings (#37). The bathroom was unusually large, too.Breakfast was o.k., but the quality of the baked goods was not as good as we had elsewhere. Also, breakfast was served in a make-shift breakfast room because the reception area and breakfast room were being remodeled. The food may taste better in the more attractive surroundings.The staff was pleasant and helpful.While searching for a restaurant recommended by one of our guidebooks, we stumbled on a delightful restaurant at which we ate several times: Hostaria il Desco at Via del Terme 23, which is near the Rialto Bridge. This restaurant, which opened less than a year ago, is already popular with locals. They have great prices and delicious food. Check out the special lunch menu and ask for the set dinner menu.

<Content>Unbelievable Reviews... Seriously I've waited for months to enter this review because I didn't want to be unfair. What WAS unfair was paying a moderate rate (over 300 euros/night) for what was possibly the dirtiest, smallest (shower was OVER the toilet) most uncomfortable room ever. The carpet was so soiled we had to wear shoes in the room. Bedspread was dirty. Furniture looked like 1950s motel version. I've stayed all over the world, and still can't believe I put up with this. I can only think the hotel must have been overbooked, and we checked in late, and were given a room normally used for storage. We were tired, and couldn't face switching hotels during high season, so we survived two nights here. The family who runs the hotel was nice, yes, but the conditions were deplorable. I wish I'd pursued some kind of restitution. Even that wouldn't have made up for how awful this experience was. And I brought my husband here to celebrate his 50th birthday. Very sad. I'm sick every time I think about it. Luckily the Cinque Terrre and Rome hotels, with accurate reviews on TripAdvisor, helped cancel out this memory. Live and learn.

<Content>Amazing We are a couple and stayed in the quad bed suite at the front of the hotel. It had 2 rooms, although we only utilised the main bedroom. The room was spacious and nicely decorated, and most importantly very clean.We were very impressed with the professionalism, friendliness, down to earth and helpful staff, nothing was too much to ask.This hotel was by far the best on our 4 city trip.Will definitely return in the future and highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Florence.P.S. The hotel is currently going through renovations, we saw several rooms. They are all fantastic.

<Content>Wonderful family-run hotel It was undergoing some construction on the 2nd level at the time, but it didn't take away from our stay at the Hotel Europa. It is family-run, and every member at the front desk were friendly, helpful, and considerate. I think the first floor was recently redone because everything seemed new. Our room was spacious and clean, and the bathroom was more than adequate. The window faced the parking lot in back with a view of the Duomo, so it was very quiet. You can't beat the location--close to all the sights and within walking distance to the train station. Breakfast (mainly pastries) was included.

<Content>Best Value Hotel in Florence This is a great hotel in a great location. It feels more like a family run bed and breakfast than a hotel. Room was very clean and modern 鈥?better than the star rating suggests. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Renovations didn鈥檛 interrupt our stay and should be finished shortly.

<Content>Wonderful - perfect hospitality! You could not ask for nicer hosts or a better location. Close to everything. The rooms are fine, nothing extravagant but nice and clean and very roomy.The best thing about this place are your hosts. Their website says Miriam, Robert, Gassim, Mary and all the staff are ready to host their guests with individual attention and care... and that's exactly what you can expect.I can't say enough about how wonderful everyone was during our visit.I would not hesitate to stay here again on my next visit to Florence.

<Content>Wonderful stay. We just returned from our first trip to Italy. We chose the Hotel Europa for our four night stay in Florence. The owner and his family were extremely polite and helpful to us. The rooms were quite clean and ours had a view of the Duomo. This Hotel had an excellent location for getting to the markets, Duomo, Uffizi, Accademia, Ponte Vecchio, etc. It is right in the middle of everything, but also very quiet when you need to rest. They provided us with a continental breakfast every morning, which included yummy cappucino, which I miss already! If we ever get a chance to return to Florence, I would most definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent service, great value for your money First time in Florence, we had made quite a research before we decided to cancel other reservations and book with Europa. The location of the hotel is great, a short walking distance from the Duomo and very close to Accademia. The room we stayed in was recently renovated with good taste, as in the pictures, with a comfortable double bed, wifi internet, TFT screen, brand new bathroom with shower cabin and a balcony with a good view of the Duomo dome. One of the really strong points were the hosts! The hotel is family run and the hosts were excellent! Very polite and helpful, always eager to give information about restaurants, excursions, they even made reservations for tickets for the museums we planned to visit. In a nutshell, good rooms, great value for money, excellent hosts, great location, keep it up!

<Content>Supreme Service, Wonderful Location There are so many recommendations for accommodations in Florence that it is hard to decide what to do. I travel to Italy for a month every year but really had not ventured to Florence. This year was the year. I decided on Hotel Europa because of price, location and the ability to accommodate three people in one room.From start to finish, I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this place. Miriam and Robert are the consummate hoteliers, tending to our every need, request, and service. We were traveling with a honeymooning couple this time, who had never been to Europe before. I know they had many questions and concerns, but let me tell you, Robert and Miriam put them at ease and made their trip a joy. There was no question too simple for them to take the time to answer.The rooms were very large, by European urban standards. They were spotless, particularly the bathrooms. Don't expect a view, unless you want to pay three times the price elsewhere. We were rarely in our room, nor did we come to Florence for a window view. The triple room we had was downright enormous, and could have easily slept a dozen folks elsewhere! Who would have known?It is a stone's throw from the Duomo, and an easy walk from the train station. Enjoy!Bonnie Guzman

<Content>Excellent Hotel with a beautiful room, helpful staff and great location We stayed at Hotel Europa for 2 nights. Great clean room with a view of the tip of the Duomo. Nice bathroom as well. Easy location to everywhere. Never used public transportation except for bus from train station to hotel. When we left, we were able to walk to the station. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Breakfast was completely sufficient.They are on the second floor so if you have a lot of luggage, take heed. There is an elevator, but it is small. My wife and I each had a large suitcase and two carry bags and had no issues. Loved this place and would stay there again in a second.

<Content>Great location, wonderful hosts! We stayed at Hotel Europa in September 2005 and returned with our two teenaged children this year. The location and value of this gem cannot be beat. It is a 5 minute walk to the Duomo, Florence's historic center and the Ponte Vecchio. The Hotel's second floor is currently under renovation but the work did not disrupt our stay in the least. Miriam and Gassim were wonderful, making restaurant reservations and helping us with directions, etc. The rooms we stayed in on the first floor were newly renovated with modern baths, comfortable beds and a partial view of the Duomo. We awoke every morning to the sound of the bells from the square. The hotel has an elevator. Breakfast was adequate and the coffee was great. We would not hesitate to stay at the Hotel Europa again. Miriam and Gassim made it feel like home away from home.

<Content>Great Great Hotel... Wished Was The Same Everywhere.. We stayed at this hotel in march on our 10th aniversary, we booked it based on the reviews at tripadvisor and it meet all our expectations and more...The rooms are beautiful and big as also the bahtroom for europe standards, very clean great view (tipical italian scenery) , great location near to everything you need to see, walking distance and overall graet service. Miriam and their family are great hostes, they make you feel good in every single detail. My wife doesn't like to be cold and we were having a little bit of trouble with the heating in our room, we told them and they fix it immediately. Our first morning there, we didn麓t wake up too early because of our long trip the day before and we thougth we missed breakfast (like in other hotels that you have to be on time or you don麓t get anything) but they were wating for us with a big smile and ready to serve us. After staying here in Florence we went to Rome and it was also a good hotel but my wife kept telling me that she missed the hotel europa and the attention. On the day we left Miriam gave us some cookies for our aniversary to take home and we enjoyed them very much.It was a great trip I hope we could go back to Hotel Europa some day.

The rooms are spacious and tastefully appointed to a high standard for a 2 star. The owners are always on hand to help with restaurant recommendations, booking tickets e.t.c., nothing was too much trouble. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Easily one of the best value hotels we have stayed in - highly recommended!

<Content>Nice and Close to The Duomo Overall, we had a nice experience at this hotel. The family running it was super friendly. When you first enter the hotel it throws you because you enter a corridor and have to take the steps or an elevator to the lobby. Once inside the rooms are very spacious, The furnishings and the bathrooms were good, although the beds and pillows were super hard. The view other people wrote about was non-existent from our room...but, the location is really a plus. After driving in at night we were surpised in the morning that it was really only couple of blocks to the Duomo, etc.

<Content>Excellent location and great staff - highly recommended We booked this hotel based on the reviews at Tripadvisor. The number and caliber of most reviews were amazing.First impressions count. My flight was scheduled for late evening, but it was badly delayed. I called the hotel before boarding. Their attitude made the first good impression. Receiving a warm welcome in the middle of the night healed most of the pain of a very delayed arrival. Gassim and Miriam are wonderful hosts.The location is perfect. Like many guests, I had an amazing view of the Duomo from my window. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, clean and very well maintained. The bathrooms are well furnished and very clean as well.Florence is a big open air museum and cultural centre. It is plenty of top fashion brands for serious shoppers.The overall stay and the outstanding service from the hotel exceeded all my expectations. Highly recommended!

<Content>Excellent 2 Star Clean and comfortable, the staff/owners are very friendly and willing to help wherever they can making museum reservations, booking restaurants and calling taxis. We had a late flight back home, our luggage was looked after throughout the day and they even made us a cup of tea before we set of for the station. Excellent location for seeing all the sights of Florence. If you decide to travel from Florence to Pisa Airport by coach with Terravision make sure you buy your ticket in advance from the Bar Deanna (just across the road from the station) priority is given to tickets holders and you may not get on the coach if it is busy.

<Content>Friendly hotel in great location My husband and I stayed in this family run hotel for 2 nights. It is located in walking distance of the main train station between the Duomo and Galleria del'Academia so the location is perfect! Although it is situated on a busy road, the rooms are in the back of the building and we heard nothing but birds and church bells. The rooms are charmingly decorated and comfortable. The bed was good too. Perhaps not up to standard if you are used to top-end hotels but perfectly clean and pleasant. The best part of the hotel however (apart from the location) are the people that work there. They are very friendly and helpful and make you feel at home. We would definitely recommend this hotels to friends and family.

<Content>Lovely hotel, lovely hosts What a lovely stay! The hotel is in a terrific location and has beautiful Florentine rooms that are kept very clean. The owners are wonderful, and despite a few small problems, they resolved all our concerns and gave us wonderful service. Miriam made reservations for us at the museums, which saved us hours of waiting in line. She also recommended an amazing restaurant, which turned out to be THE BEST food we had in our entire trip to Italy. The price was reasonable considering the great location (right between the Duomo and the Accademia) and the personalized service. I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in Florence.

<Content>Wonderful Stay, Wonderful Hosts My husband and I stayed at Hotel Europa for about 7 nights in September 2007. The hotel was absolutely charming and Miriam and Gassim were wonderful. When we checked in, our room did not have a bathtub, which I was really hoping for. We asked Gassim if it would be possible to move rooms when one was available. That evening, when we came back from dinner, Gassim had a beautiful room available with a bathtub. It turns out that it was one of the rooms for four people. While we were in Florence we found out that we were expecting our first child. A very happy surprise to say the least. Miriam helped us to rearrange several travel plans since I was not feeling well and she was genuinely excited for us. When we checked out she had a present for us and wished us well. I cannot say enough good things about the hotel. The facilities themselves are clean, charming, and in a great location. The class that the hotel owners and staff bring to the establishment are what make the hotel truly special. We hope to return with our baby daughter to this wonderful hotel and until then will remember it with fond memories.

<Content>Family run hotel, warm and friendly service A group of us stayed in Hotel Europa for a weekend. Excellent location- less than 5 minutes walk from the Duomo and Accademia (David). We booked directly with the hotel. Miriam and her family could not have been more helpful. They arranged reservations for us for the Uffizi and the Accademia and did not charge for this service. This saved us lots of time in queues.Rooms were spacious with traditional furniture.Basic continental breakfast with lovely cappuchinos.Excellent value for the location and service. Would definitely recommend to friends.

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel, A Special Place in Florence Firstly can I say the last hotel I stayed in was 5 star and one of the Leading Hotels of the World. The staff at the Hotel Europa could give them some lessons with their wonderful helpful manner and availability to assist. Amazing 10 out of 10.The location for this hotel could not be any better, close to the tourist information, market, restaurants, Duomo, shops and bars.The owners are so helpful, friendly and obviously take huge pride in their fabulous hotel. It is immaculately clean throughout this includes the rooms, floor, bathrooms and all common areas and most importantly the sheets with extra pillows and blankets provided. Soap, shower cap and shampoo were supplied in small but adequtely sachets. The view from the Dante room is great, you can see the top of the Duomo and it looks over a pleasant courtyard.If you fly from London Stansted to Pisa and you choose to stay in Florence buy the Terravision bus ticket for the journey whilst on the aircraft from Ryanair. Approximately 8 euros single and return is 14 euros. This is a hours journey and it is the cheapest and most convenient way to get to the centre of Florence. The hotel is about 8 minutes away from the bus station and should you have much luggage then a short cab ride will be the easiest way for you to find the Hotel or if you have a map look for Via Cavour (which is right next to Palazzo Medici Riccardi on the map).Ask at the Hotel for tips on best places to eat and sites etc and they are happy to help: Michelanglos David is at the back of the hotel plus the City Tour Bus which you can hop on and hop off of is also right next to the hotel - again ask and they are more than happy to help. The only reason I can honestly say this hotel must be a two star rating is because of its entrance from the road. Its dark and we chose to use the stone stairs (their is a lift) and for the first 10 second you could be apprehensive but once you open the door and receive the warm greeting that soon fades away. The rest of the hotel is a good 4 star in my book.

<Content>Highly Recommended The Europa is a great place to stay in Florence. The hotel is really central, just a few minutes walk from the Duomo - and opposite the wonderful Medici palace. It was comfortable, wonderfully clean and excellent value for money. Miriam and her family were extremely hospitable and gave us great advice on restaurants and sights. Nothing seemed too much trouble for them and they made our stay just perfect. I would not hesitate to recommend the Europa and will definitely be staying there as and when I return to Florence.

<Content>Highly recommended (French is my native language, sorry for my english)I stayed in many hotels in Florence and studied there for a while. The Europa has an excellent price/room ration.Location: PERFECT! seriously. when visiting Florence you walk a lot and this hotel is located 5 minutes away from the Old town and all its monuments and shopping center.Room: big, spacious for European standards. Very clean. Cute in a Florentine way. Some rooms have a small view of the Duomo. My husband and I were that luckyThe bathroom was small but was perfectly functioning and the shower had enough pressure to make it totally enjoyable.Service: Amazing, everybody is very friendly and helpful, always smiling. - customer service in the sates is usually good and people are friendly unlike in Europe especially in Florence where for what ever reason people are snobby in stores and restaurants - but not at the hotel . I had to fax a document to my work and the owner did it for me at no cost! Breakfast: well this is why this review has 4 stars and not 5. Coffee is ok, there is tea. but everything else is pretty blend but good enough to start the day. But seriously.... In Italy.... there are so many delicious coffee shops very close to the hotel with delicious breakfast treats that it is a shame not to take advantage of those, it adds a little more to the budget but totally worth it!

<Content>Wonderful HotelI In Great Location Just got back from four days in Florence. The Hotel Europa far exceeded my expectations. Gassim and Miriam are wonderful hosts who go out of their way to make their guests feel at home. We arrived from an overnight train at 7:00 AM expecting to wait until after checkout for our room. Instead, Gassim got us in a room within minutes of arrival. Rooms are clean and warm, many of which with views of the Duomo. The location is within a quick walk to many of the attractions and museums. I would recommend Hotel Europa for anybody who wishes for a reasonable hotel in a prime location in Florence.

<Content>Great Location  Can highly recommend this hotel, the service was above reproach and we were travelling with a baby and the cot provided was clean, new and safe, much better than some of the others we had on our holiday. Our room was roomy, clean, and the furnishings were fantastic, nice and homey and just want you want on a holiday. Was very impressed with the modern bathroom which had a tub as well as a shower and we had a view of the cathedral dome from our room. There is a lift, but not for the fainthearted as it was a bit sqeezy but better than lugging them up the stairs. Only thing we found was that driving there was a nightmare, no fault of the hotels, but the roads were awful when we went so i suggest a gps or have their number on hand for directions. Otherwise our stay was an A+. Oh and the location was fab, only a short walk to the cathedral, markets, acadamia and many other sites.

<Content>great hotel, fabulous location Miriam and her family made us feel at home from the moment we steped inside, the good sized room was light and airey and had a view of the Duomo.We had requested advanced bookings for the Uffizi and the Bargello and they were waiting for us.Miriams advise as to where to eat was first rate.We had such a pleasant stay in this hotel I would recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in Florence.The hotels location, almost opposite the Medici Palace, (wonderful frescos in the chapel) puts it within walking distance of most places of interest.If and when I return to Florence I most certainly will be staying at the Hotel Europa.

<Content>OK, but overrated - and nasty mosquitoes! Good location, and the owner, Marion, is extremely nice, and speaks very good English and French. But I would not recommend this place. We stayed in the Dante suite (room 36) for 4 nights. Large room, with mock antique Italian furniture and large windows that opened to the courtyard (all rooms open to the courtyard out back). But we did NOT sleep well due to all the mosquitoes! It sounds bizarre even to me, and I lived it, but there were many mosquitoes, every night, and we were there in November! Each night I spent 30 minutes killing all the mosquitoes before going to sleep, and each night we were woken by buzzing in our ears, and had to get up to kill them. We had the windows closed all day and all night, but they still got in, so they must have been coming from the venting system or the air-con vent....It was insane. The last night I was up for over an hour, at 3 am, killing mosquitoes, over 10 of them (many full of blood)! No, I'm not kidding. Even though we only had one more night, I finally complained and asked to move rooms. The older fellow (Marion's father?) was nice, but hesitant to move us and wanted to spray (!) the room with some mosquito-killing gas instead. We said no way. He said they spray all the rooms (yikes!) and all the hotels in Florence have mosquitoes...have not stayed anywhere else in Florence but find it very had to believe that, especially in cold, dry November, all hotels in the city have mosquitoes. He tried to talk us into using this plug-in mosquito killer thing that gives off some kind of chemical; I was not willing to do that either. I insisted we be moved to a room far away from the Dante suite (it was Monday night so there were empty rooms), and he finally did. He moved us to one of the 'non-suite' rooms on the floor above, room 50, and it was nice! It was smaller than the Dante suite, but still big enough, did not have the mock-old-Italian decor, but it had a better view and best of all, no mosquitoes (well, only one), so it turned out to be our best night's sleep. (We had the windows open quite some time as well, so I'm sure the mosquitoes in the Dante suite must have been coming in by the venting system somehow). The breakfast was not that great (processed cheese in Italy?!), and the entry to the hotel is dank. On the last day we had to check out early to catch the train, so we went to breakfast just as it began, and when we walked into the breakfast room the older felllow was spraying the floor with some kind of bug killer! We had a quick bite and went to check out around 7:15. The older fellow was alone and he wanted us to wait until after breakfast to check out (2 hours later, even though no one was at breakfast yet). We explained we had to catch the train. He chidied us for not checking out the night before (?). He did not know how to use the computer, it took forever, and he finally had to hand-write the bill. Then he actually asked us to give them a good rating on Trip Advisor and not mention the mosquitoes! There are many, many hotels in Florence and next time I go, I will definitely go somewhere else. If you must stay here, stay in a non-suite room on the top floor. It is less a hotel and more a strictly family-run bed and breakfast. I think a lot of the reviews are so positive because Marion and her family are very friendly and chatty, (unlike many places in Italy). But if you don't really need the chit-chat or the tourist advice, it's not that great.

<Content>Fantastic! After reading so many great reviews about Hotel Europa on Tripadvisor I decided my husband and I had to stay there for our time in Florence.I contacted the hotel direct and they offered us a superior room at a very competitive price.Our room was spacious, we had a balcony and a view of the Duomo.They took care of our laundry and it only cost us 10 Euro for 10 shirts and a pile of underwear.The service was great and the hospitality was exceptional. The staff was always helpful in pointing out great local restaurants.We really enjoyed our stay and will definately be returning.

<Content>Great experience We stayed at the Hotel Europa in January 2008 for 2 nights. The location is excellent, the room was great with plenty of space. We were using a travel cot for our young son and there was still loads of room - as well as a supersize bed and two further singles! Staff were very helpful and the breakfast certainly set us up for the day. if we're back in Florence again we'll definitely go back.

<Content>A Perfect bit of Florence My wife and I recently spent 8 days in Florence visiting our daughter. Our room at Hotel Europa had a view of the Duomo and was Florentine magic in itself. The Hotel's central location made for an easy walk to all of the museums, the market and the sites. Miriam and Gasim were wonderful and helped to make our visit a wonderful experience.

<Content>No better location or hospitality in Florence! The Hotel Europa is an excellent choice in Florence. It is within short walking distance to all of the city's main attractions: the Duomo, Accademia, Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio, great restuarants/ galleries/shopping! The staff is incredibly warm, friendly, and acoommodating. They treat you like you are part of their family! We will never stay anywhere else when we visit Florence!

<Content>Great place to stay in Florence We booked this hotel the night before we needed a room for 3 adults. The hotel was very accommodating, and actually gave us the family suite since it was the only one available. They were apologetic because it was the only thing that they had available and it was on the main floor. There was definitely nothing to apologize for since the suite was huge and exceeded our expectations. The room was clean, and had very high ceilings which were painted with beautiful murals.We had also wanted to see Michelangelo's David, which was right around the corner from the hotel and the hotel had made reservations for us to see it that same day we arrived. Seeing as the line to get into this place, especially last minute, was hours long, this was a huge help! The hotel also booked a tour of the Uffizi Gallery for us as well, which was also huge since the wait to get into that museum was just as long as to see the David, if not longer. The hotel also did not charge us to make these reservations, they made them for no extra charge.On our last day there, they gladly held onto our bags after checkout, for no extra charge, while we took the day to continue our exploration of the city.I have some pictures that I'll post once I finish sorting through all of them. :)Overall we had a great experience there and I would definitely stay there again when I come back to Florence!

<Content>A Quiet Oasis in Central Florence We had an enjoyable 3-night stay at the Europa, a 2-star hotel that could rate higher. It is located on the 2nd  3rd floors of a building on the east side of Via Cavour a block and a half north of the Duomo. The entrance is well-marked and through the glass doors is a small elevator that didn鈥檛 quite hold the two of us and our luggage. The well-worn marble stairs are an alternative. The 鈥渟uite level鈥?rooms on the 2nd floor are spacious, and the 3rd floor seems to be a mix of large and small rooms, including the balcony room (#47). There are small reception desks on each level; owners Gassim and family get plenty of exercise going up and down the stairs between them when only one is in duty! There is a large sitting room on the 2nd floor, where the internet access is located, and on the 3rd floor above it is the breakfast room.  Our L-shaped triple (#37) was very large with high ceilings and tile floors, but no view. The window looked down on a nondescript central court. The Florentine-style furnishings were attractive, including a comfortable bed, a large desk and an armoire with a couple of drawers, but there was plenty of room for a dresser and maybe an armchair, which would have been nice. The air-conditioning unit over the door is operated by a remote. The bathroom was clean and huge, nicely tiled, with a large pedestal sink and a shower enclosure in one corner. Water pressure was good, with plenty of hot water. There was an unusual chemical odor in the bathroom that we couldn鈥檛 figure out, but failed to ask the staff about.  Having stayed previously in hotels along the Arno in rooms facing the river, we can say one of the nicest features of the Europa is: it is QUIET! Although Via Cavour is busy, the rooms are toward the back of the building, so there was no sound of motor scooters at 2 am.  The breakfast room is very pleasant, with a frescoed ceiling, and the food selection is familiar but ample: hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, cereals, rolls, pastries and fruit. Gassim is there to greet everyone and explain the workings of the large coffee/cappuccino machine. The owners are very helpful with advice and reservations, suggesting restaurants and calling for museum reservations (they will make these for you before arrival if you wish). Upon departure, the taxi they called for us arrived exactly on time. If you鈥檙e shopping for children or grandchildren, the large toy store on the other side of the street is not to be missed!

<Content>A Good Choice for Florence We very much enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Europa. Central location, spacious room (Donatello Suite), and lovely owners. Miriam is a gem! My only complaint was the breakfast. Compared to the other hotels where we stayed in Italy, the Europa's breakfast was just average. They could improve the variety of items (for example, add bananas, have more than two cold cereal choices, offer Italian bread instead of store-bought white bread) and serve better coffee. Otherwise, we have no complaints about the Europa and would stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Perfect blend for central Florence This was our second visit to Hotel Europa in Florence from our home in Michigan. We returned because of the perfect blend of friendliness, location, price and amenities. Miriam and Gassim speak fluent English and are truly at your service. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the location is just 1 1/2 blocks from the Duomo and there is no street noise. You can negotiate a lower rate if you pay in cash. My mother and I thank you for another wonderful week!

<Content>A Great Experience What a great experience! My husband and I stayed at Hotel Europa in early October for 4 nights. The location was excellent and the hotel was very comfortable and clean. Mariam and Gasim were very kind and helpful with their directions and recommendations to restaurants, attractions and our wine tour. They truly made us feel welcome, not only to their hotel but to their city. Thank you both for all your help trying to locate our phone. It finally arrived back in the states after our return home. ha. I would definitely stay here again. Hello to Maria. She was a delight!

<Content>Another Jewel in Florence I recently spent 10 days (Oct. 8-18) at Hotel Europa on my first visit to Florence. The central location makes it the perfect base for exploring this wonderful city. Gasim, Miriam and the rest of the staff were very friendly and helpful. My room was clean and comfortable. While small by American standards, it was a little larger than many of the hotels I have stayed at in Europe. It was not cramped at all for one person. The bathroom was nice (it appeared to be fairly new), and was made spotless daily. If I go back to Florence, I will certainly return to this hotel. Also, the rates make it a true bargain.

<Content>Quiet yet ideally located Located five mins walk from the Duomo, markets and some museums our room was at the back of the hotel so very quiet (except for the campanile bells!). Our room overlooked a courtyard with the duomo dome and campanile in the background. The room was very clean and comfortable whilst the bathroom recently renovated. The family running the hotel were very helpful with restaurant recommendations and other advice and nothing was too much trouble for them.

<Content>The Best Location, huge rooms for European hotel! Perfect location for arriving in Florence by train! We walked from the Santa Maria Novella Station to Hotel Europa in 5 minutes.We never had to take a bus or taxi as the hotel is so centrally located that we walked everywhere. Our suite was huge, although we had no view (which was fine for us). It was clean and comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They booked tickets to the Academia for us and found a tour to the Uffizi as well. They also booked a hotel for a following night in another city! We are Americans living in Europe, and by European standards, this is a wonderful hotel. Americans might not find the hotel up to the standards that they are used to. But that's no fault of this hotel (the expectations just need to change a little).

<Content>Great Location and very quiet We stayed in the suites (only slightly more expensive than the hotel rooms), and the room we had was a good size, nice bathroom, lovely big bed and very quiet. This family run hotel is very good value for money and the staff are excellent. The car parking situation is interesting, you give the keys to reception and the car is taken away and when you request, the car is returned and you pay the driver. I was a bit concerned about this, but it was a very good service. Breakfast is the 3* part of the stay. It is perfectly OK, but not outstanding. The bread is marketed as American, so it is a bit sweet for my taste. Coffee and tea were good. Being a short walk from the Duomo, restaurants and shopping is a major benefit of this lovely hotel.

<Content>Lovely central hotel We really liked this hotel. It has a really central location and is, for the centre of Florence, reasonably priced. The owners/staff were very helpful recommending places to eat (in fact we'd already eaten at the place they recommended and had found it excellent) and booking another place for us. If you're the kind of person who likes big TVs, 24 hour room service and Corby trouser-presses then this place isn't for you. But if you care more about clean rooms with comfortable beds and good bathrooms, then I don't think you'll be disappointed. And if you also add to this some character (old-fashioned lift and murals) and location (5 minutes walk to the Duomo), you have a really lovely hotel. We got a suite which was enormous with high ceilings. A thoroughly enjoyable stay.

<Content>A little disappointing Maybe our hopes had been raised too high by the glowing reports from the other reviewers. We had a room on the lower floor of the hotel so our only view was of a dingy courtyard. The room was very dark and we needed the lights on at all times of day. The bathroon was huge, and the shower was excellent but there was no bath. The bed was excellent, really comfortable (and I'm not easily pleased).The breakfast was typical of our experiences of Italian hotels, no worse and no better. The breakfast room is arranged with only two tables for two people, one for four and then a very large table at which anyone else must sit. The tables are close together which makes getting up to refill your coffee quite a challenge.The family who run the hotel are very pleasant and are either very fluent or native English speakers which is an advantage if your Italian is shaky. The position of the hotel is fantastic, 15 minutes walk maximum, even dragging a case, to the station and two minutes from the duomo yet very quiet.

<Content>Comfortable Stay We [2 couples] spent 5 nights at The Hotel Europa,we had 2 suites ours had a view of the Campanile our friends had a squinty view of The Duomo.The rooms were clean plainly furnished and decorated.The beds were very comfortable.The location is great, walking distance to all of the sights.The proprietors and staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.The breakfast buffet was ample but I feel that the tables could be rearranged to make the room less like a hostel.If visiting The Palazzo Vecchio check out The Secret Passages Tour it is only 2 euros extra and well worth it.

<Content>Lovely place to stay in Florence We stayed at the Europa for 4 nights in October and were very happy with it from the moment Gassim greeted us with our christian names and showed us our room with its view of the top of the dome of the Duomo and the Campenile to the very warm farewell from Miriam when we left. The room was one of the standard rooms on the second floor and had been newly renovated. The bed was large and comfortable, the room spacious with bathroom ensuite, all spotlessly clean.The breakfast room with its 13th century frescoes on the ceiling is very homely and Gassim presides over it ensuring everyone has their coffee or tea as they like it and the breakfast fare is reasonably extensive by italian standards.The hotel is very well located for getting to all the major sites in Florence on foot and is only about 20 minutes on foot from the train station. All in all a great place to stay. Gassim  Miriam are lovely people who make you feel welcome and are happy to help with making bookings, checking train times,etc

<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent location My husband and I just returned from Florence, after spending 6 nights at Hotel Europa, which I highly recommend. The hotel is centrally located, and within easy walking distance of many of the places you will want to visit, and there are also a number of restaurants close by. The entrance to the hotel is not particularly attractive, and a tiny elevator will take you up to the second floor. But once you are inside, you will feel at home! The hotel is clean and the rooms are comfortable and attractive; despite its central location, the hotel is quiet at night; and the breakfast is generous (cereals, fruit, yoghourt, rolls, jams, etc.).What makes the hotel special, however, is the warmth of its owners. Gassim made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived, and his kindness and gracious manner enhanced our entire stay. When it was time for us to leave, I felt we were saying goodby to a friend.

<Content>Great hotel Cannot say enough about this family-run bed and breakfast 2 blocks north of the Duomo. My sister and I just returned from Florence (end of October 2007). First, the hotel's location couldn't be better鈥攃lose to train station (about 10-15 minute walk with luggage) and the Duomo area. Second, the room was spacious, clean, and quiet. The breakfast was a great buffet/continental breakfast of fruit, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, bread/toast, croissants, ham, cheese, and various drinks. Third, the staff was just wonderful. Miriam, Robert, Giassim, and Mama were so friendly and willing to do anything for us. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there on my next trip to Florence. They have internet service too at a price of 1.5 euros per 15 minutes.

<Content>Loved the views to the Duomo and Campanile from our Room We have completed our first trip to Italy, and as they say first impressions count. Our expectations of the hotel from the web were not wrong. Our friends had recommended the hotels location and friendly management and we wernt dissapointed. Our room had a view out to the Duomo and Campanile, so close to the centre of Florence. As with most buildings in Florence, the bland facades hide the best interiors. The hotel has the charm of a turn of the century apartment building with its open shaft electric elevator up to the first floor suites and second floor standard rooms. Our standard room was spacious with a window looking out to the roofs of the Cities magnificent heritage. We were pleased to find the nights were quiet, travellors exhaustion a priority with our programme. Breakfasts were a treat with Gassimes attention to detail and his insistence to create your coffees on his pride and joy, his coffee machine. The 300 year old decorated domed ceiling of the breakfast room added the final touch to a days start. We drove on our trip and car parking was attended to by a simple valet service to a garage in some part of the city for only 20 euros a day, a phone call and 15 minutes later we were on our way on day trips into Tuscany.Overall our experience with Miriam, Gassime and the staff of the Europa was great, we would recommend them to our friends.

<Content>Great Service, great location We stayed in room 136 on the first floor overlooking the courtyard at the back of the hotel. The room was very pleasant, large, airy, spotlessly clean and very quiet with a lovely view of the Duomo. It was also nice and cool and we had no need to use the aircon facility. The bathrrom was also spacious with lots of hot water. The location of the hotel is perfect for a trip to Florence, the Duomo is literally at the bottom of the street and the Medicci Palace across the road and only 5 minutes walk from the train station. We were a little unsure when we first arrived having to climb into a rickety old lift, but what a lovely surprise when we got out of the lift and entered the reception area to a warm and friendly welcome. What you need to remember is the building dates back to the 13th century and has the original frescoes still on the ceilings, cracks and all. Unfortunately I broke my foot the first night there so this did spoil our visit, however the hotel staff went out ot their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible - especially Miriam who even took the time to accompany my husband to the chemist so she could translate for him and ensure that the medication we were given at the hospital were administered correctly. She also rang around all possible suppliers of a wheelchair for us. We will definitely return to Florence and to the Hotel Europa.

<Content>Great location and value At first glance, the hotel looks a little questionable... it is located in a very old 5 floor building with a tiny lift to the 3rd floor front desk. However, we thoroughly enoyed our stay at the Hotel Europa. The hotel is located about 3 mins away from the Duomo and another short walk to the museum with Michaelangelo's David. The neighborhood is busy, but nice. Just past the Duomo is Florence's main old city complete with shopping and the Arno river.The rooms are very large (comparatively for others in similar size hotels in Italy and the rest of Europe) and have flat screen TV's and good size bathrooms. All the furnishings are neat and modern which belies the general age of the 15th century building the hotel occupies.The breakfast each morning was very decent. The staff was always pleasant and courteous to a fault. You could spend twice the price in Florence and not have this great of an experience. It was a pleasure to stay there and we'll definitely stay there on any return to Florence.

<Content>Great value for a comfortable room Hotel Europa provides a nice room for a decent price in the heart of Florence. We stayed in a recently remodeled junior suite, which was comfortable and quiet. The breakfast room and public spaces are well-appointed, and the breakfast is good. The entry from the via Cavour, a very busy street, looks a little dubious, but the main reception area quickly dispels any concerns. The family running the place is very accommodating, and go out of their way to help. For those willing to pay twice the price, there are undoubtedly nicer hotels in town. But for those looking for a comfortable bed, a clean bathroom and a convenient location, Hotel Europa is hard to beat.

<Content>A great hotel in the heart of florence I have stayed at the Hotel Europa several times over the past ten years. It's a wonderfully decorated hotel in central Florence. It's only a short walk to the Duomo, the rooms are clean and the service is first class. The breakfast is great and the owners are more than willing to help with any request.

<Content>One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at My husband and I spent a week here at the start of September. We loved this hotel and are planning to go back. We both travel a lot with our work both in the UK and overseas. This hotel is not a standard chain experience. There is no pool or room service. What we got was a personal concierge experience.Our room looked out over the courtyard and had a great balcony. The room had been recently done up with flat screen TV, frosted glass lights and the bathroom had a great shower and was immaculate.Miriam, Gassim and Robert were fantastic. We had a list of restaurants we wanted to try and they phoned and made reservations for us. Il Rivero round the corner was one of the best meals we had in Florence. The service was such that when the PC they had for guests wasn't working they even let me use the one behind reception to print some tickets out.Not sure what one reviewer said about the coffee - it's an awesome bean to cup machine and we had some really good coffee at breakfast.Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and the people running it make it something special

<Content>great choice We spent five nights at the Europa after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. We were very happy with the clean, bright comfortable and very, very quiet room. Everything in it was new and the bed was great. The location was perfect and there was a laundromat nearby. The best was having Gassim make me tea on my return to the hotel from hours of touring. It was greatly appreciated since being a tea drinker in Italy is not easy as many restaurants do not serve tea. I would recocmmend the hotel and specify a courtyard room versus one on the street.

<Content>Great mid-range spot in Florence Nice hotel, very conveniently located. Just a 5 minute walk from the main Duomo in Florence. The staff are very helpful. The rooms are fine - nothing too fancy but certainly nice. Bathrooms were clean and a good size. The location is such that you can certainly stop back in the middle of a day of sightseeing for a rest. Miriam, one of the proprietors, recommended a very nice restaurant called Za Za which we enjoyed (excellent eggplant parm). Breakfast is standard Italian hotel breakfast (actually maybe a little more) - cereal, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, toast, coffee, tea, and juice are all available. I would definitely recommend this place if you don't want to spend too much but don't want to stay at a below-average place either.

<Content>Couldn't have been better We stayed at the Europa for three nights of our honeymoon and we couldn't have been more impressed. The hotel was fairly cheap in comparison with other centrally located hotels but we trusted the reviews on Trip Advisor and went for it and we we're not disappointed. From the main railway station we got to the hotel in about 5 mins on foot. The journey takes you through part of the main market which is very exciting and makes you want to dump your bags and get amongst it.We were greeted on arrival with a very friendly family atmosphere and were shown to our room immediately. The room was very spacious with a remarkably well fitted bathroom (which is bigger than some hotel rooms I've stayed in), a flatscreen TV and very clean bright decor. We could even see the top of the Duomo (which is a 2 min walk away) from the window. The Acadamia gallery where Michael Angelo's David resides is only in the next street which is handy as you need to get there early to avoid queueing for ages.After settling in we we're given a map and shown some good restaurants and the location of all the main sights which set us up for the next few days.It's well worth doing the open top bus tour to get your bearings and the Boboli Gardens are a must if the weather is good.When we checked out of the Hotel we were handed a very nice bottle of Chianti which put the cherry on the cake.

<Content>Special memories of Hotel Europa We spent 4 wonderful days at the Hotel Europa. It was our second stay. Our first stay was in 1970. Imagine their surprise when we shared a picture with the owners that we had taken of all of us on our first visit. This time we added the 3rd generation on our picture.Our room was very comfortable with a view of a courtyard below and the Duomo above. The recently renovated room and ensuite bathroom were well appreciated as were the in-room safe and refrigerator. And the bed was the world's best!.The hospitality, care, personalized service, excellent accommodations, value for the dollar, and their desire to make our stay comfortable, reinforced our view that we will only stay at the Hotel Europa when we return to Florence.

<Content>Wonderful hospitality We had a wonderful but all too brief stay in Florence. Our room was spacious and clean, check-in quick and efficient. But what really made our stay was the wonderful hospitality provided to us. Gassim, Miriam and Robert were so attentive and friendly....as a previous post cited, treasures all! I too work in the hospitality industry and really appreciated it when excellent service is provided. Should we have the good fortune to be able to visit again, we will not hesitate to choose Hotel Europa. Mahalo!!!

<Content>Fabulous room, warm hospitality - I'll be coming back My husband and I spent two wonderful nights at the Hotel Europa. We were in Italy celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary. Because our trip was a special event, I wanted all our hotels to be just right. I booked our hotels about six months in advance after reading some great reviews about the Hotel Europa. Miriam, at the hotel, suggested the Dante suite, the room they select for honeymooners. It was perfect. The suite was spacious, spotless and beautiful. The pictures on the Hotel Europa site really don't do it justice. We had a large bathroom with tub, equally spotless, and a view out the wooden-cased windows of the top of the Duomo. The courtyard just outside our window was very quiet (no road noise). The next morning we were met by a very happy and helpful man, we found out later he was Miriam's dad. He brought my husband a perfect cappacino (his first of three) to start off our breakfast. It was the biggest hotel breakfast we had on our trip. We had hard-boiled eggs, ham, cheese, various breads, yogurt, cereal, juice and coffee/tea. Our only wish was that the croissants were from a local bakery, as there are so many wonderful bakeries in the area around the hotel. The location is perfect - REALLY. Just down the street from the Accedamia, the Uffizi and the Duomo. We had many thoughtful conversations with not only Miriam, but Robert (he took us to our suite the first day) and Miriam's dad. We found out that it was a family -run hotel, had been in the family for 37 years and that many of their clients come back years later to stay. I know that we'll be one of them. I wouldn't even consider staying elsewhere. Miriam also gave us a bottle of Chianti to celebrate our anniversary. It was a great touch!

<Content>The best! We absolutely loved our stay at the Hotel Europa. It wasn't just the room--which was clean, lovely, and spacious--but our hosts as well. It is a family run hotel, and they made us all feel like we were family. Gassim is a treasure, greeting us every morning at breakfast and making sure we had everything we needed. His daughter Miriam recommended restaurants and made reservations for us--all of which turned out to be fabulous. We never could have found these on our own. And son-in-law, Robert was so helpful too. We were traveling with our daughter and I think she was ready to stay there forever! We stayed in one of the suite rooms. It was a large triple room with beautiful furniture. The location is great too--just half a block from the Duomo. Of all the places we have stayed in Italy, this is our favorite. Gassim and his family made sure we had everything we needed. They went above and beyond.--The Pearsons of Carlsbad

<Content>Loved It! Hotel Europa was recommended to me by my sister-in-law who writes books on family-owned bed and breakfast hotels in Europe. I must say that I was not disappointed. The hotel is centrally located. The Duomo, Uffizi Gallery, Accademia, Ponte Vecchio, and the train station are all within walking distance from the hotel. Owner Gassim and his family make you feel so comfortable and his daughter, Miriam, was so very accommodating. As a single woman travelling alone, this was important to me. I had a lovely room on the first floor with a spacious bathroom. I feel very comfortable recommending Hotel Europa to those travelling to Florence. R. Hassell

<Content>GREAT little hotel! We booked this hotel during our stay in Florence because it was in our price range. We weren't sure what to expect but the rest of the reviews seemed good so we took a chance. Boy are we glad we did! The hotel is on the 2nd and 3rd floor of a building but there is a small elevator. We had a lot of bags so it took a couple of trips of sending bags but it wasn't bad at all. Check-in was fast and smooth. The nice woman who checked us in showed us to our room, showed us where the amenities were, pulled out a map and showed us our location along with the locations of the popular sites and some recommended restaurants. We didn't need to be shown where the Duomo and belltower were as we had a perfect view of both of them from our window. Breakfast was a traditional European breakfast, pastries, cereal, fruit, coffee, but the service was the best. As soon as you walked into the room the owner was already making you a cappucino. The hotel is in a great location as it is close to just about everything. Things look far on the map but you quickly realize they are not. We walked to EVERYTHING except for the Piazza Michaelangelo. We had such a great time staying at this hotel and would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone who doesn't expect the Four Seasons. We will definitely stay when we return to Florence, whenever that may be.

<Content>A perfect place to stay We loved the Hotel Europa - the staff are SO welcoming and friendly that you feel as if you are staying as a guest in someone's home, nothing is too much trouble. Our room was large, bright and airy with a wonderful 'picture postcard courtyard view', plus it was so peaceful, no traffic noise despite Via Cavour being quite busy. We loved the decor of the hotel - it is not plush, but very comfortable and in keeping with what you would expect of a small, family run Italian hotel. Its location is great - 10 minutes from the station (where the airport bus runs to/from) and very convenient for everything else. We adored Florence and will definitely return .. to stay, of course, in the Hotel Europa!

<Content>Excellent choice for a place to stay in Forence Hotel Europa is like a home away from home. We stayed there for two nights at the beginning of our honeymoon and then again at the end of our honeymoon. When we returned it was like going home. The owner Gasim and his family are warm and welcoming and provide information about the surrounding area, sites, restaurants etc.... Hotel Europa is steps from the duomo and many other sites. We loved it and can't wait to return. We highly recommend Europa and will think of Gasim and his family often. The lobby and elevator can seem a bit off putting, but no worries the hotel itself is wonderful

<Content>Loved the Europa in the heart of Florence We had a two night stay at the Hotel Europa in Florence and based on our experience we would strongly recommend this hotelWe booked the superior room as the comments on tripadvisor indicated that this was worth the additional cost and I have to say the room was very large and clean with everything you need with a good sized bathroom. Despite the hotel's small entrance, neon sign and being on a busy road our room faced a quiet courtyard and could not have been more peaceful.The hotel's location is excellent as it is less than 5 minutes walk to the Dumo (which we could just see from our room window) and less than 10 to the main museums.We loved this hotel and we were made to feel very at home with a warm welcome, also I mentioned a restaurant and within minutes they had a table booked for me, forget the 5* hotels when you can have this kind of service.A wonderful city with a perfect quiet hotel. What more do you need. (book your museum tickets in advance as this worked well, I phoned the museums, they gave me a reference number and agreed an arrival time and it worked without a problem)

<Content>A Great Choice in Florence! We recently completed a two night stay at The Hotel Europa in Florence and, based on our experience, we would strongly recommend this hotel for any and all travelers seeking a comfortable, quiet oasis in the midst of frenetic Florence!Our room on the 2nd floor was (suprisingly) quite large by European standards, very clean and comfortably appointed... and the bathroom was completely updated. Despite the hotel's unique entrance being just off a busy thoroughfare (Cavour), our room faced a quiet courtyard and could not have been more peaceful.The hotel's location is another strong selling point to consider. All of the key museums and sites in Florence are within an easy 15-20 minute walk of the Hotel Europa.Finally, the entire staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. And each morning, Gassim made us feel like highly-valued guests, insuring that all of our breakfast requirements were fully met.A great hotel... and a great value!

<Content>Warm, Friendly, Home Away From Home Hotel My family of 4 (2 adults, 13 year old and 10 year) arrived in Florence by train and proceded to walked from the station to Hotel Europa. We strolled along enjoying the city of Florence and found the hotel in less than half an hour. We took the lift to the first floor and were greeted warmly by Robert and his family. We were shown to our lovely quad room and were happily surprised to have such a spacious and clean room. On arriving, I came down with a head cold and felt quite miserable. Fortunately, there is a pharmacy across the road where I could buy homeopathic remedies to relieve the discomfort so that I could continue exploring this beautiful city.The owners provided us with excellent directions, travel advice etc during our stay. I had decided to do a tour with ArtViva to visit the Uffizi Gallery but had not made arrangements prior to leaving Australia. The owners suggested that ArtViva was the best tour guides in Florence. Yes, ArtViva is the best tour guide company in Florence and yes next time we travel to Florence, we will organize booking other tours to the Tuscany region prior to leaving Australia. Wonderful to know that the owners of Hotel Europa are interested in providing the best advice to their clients.The hotel is very central to the restaurant precinct. Robert's wife suggested that we have dinner at Zar Zars. Our children loved this restaurant so much that we ate every evening meal there.Our teenage boy was most impressed that the hotel provided free Internet access so that he could keep in contact with his friends back home. Thank you, Hotel Europa. Warm hospitable hotel in the heart of beautiful Florence. We would recommend this hotel to any family group staying in Florence.

<Content>Great Location, Excellent Service This hotel was in a great location - walking distance from the Duomo. The room was very large and the service excellent! The front desk staff was very helpful and even able to give us excellent dinner recommendations. My only complaint is that the air conditioning could have been better. I will definitely stay in the hotel again, but not during the hottest time of the year.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel, Very Nice Owner What I liked best about this hotel was how nice the owner's were...  When we arrived, they gave us a tour of the hotel and volunteered to set up tours for us the next day. They basically took care of everything and just told us when and where to show up. They also went through the map and gave us excellent suggestions of where to go eat. The initial room they gave us was beautiful but the air conditioner was an older unit that did not cool the room very well. When we told the owners of this, they moved us to a triple with a great air conditioner at no extra cost. At the end of the stay, they knocked off ten dollars a night as well. If you would like a nice place to stay where you will be treated very well, this is your place.

<Content>Hotel Europa: A real treasure in Florence!! I have just returned from my second stay at Hotel Europa (4-day stay August 4-7th, 2007 and August 2005). Once again, I am extremely happy with this hotel that I felt I had to write a review to share the news. With all confidence I can say that when you visit Florence, this is the place you must stay!!! Here's why:1) Location: To your left, Il Duomo. To your right, the Galleria dell'Accademia (where Michelangelo's David is located). Across and down the street, Florence's famous outdoor market. 10 minute walk, the train station. A better location would be impossible to find!! And although everything is in close promixity, the street where Hotel Europa is located is quiet and quaint at night. A perfect 10!2) Facilites: Clean, spacious,  modern amenities located in a small hotel atmosphere! The Standard room that we stayed in was just perfect. Great size, air-conditioned, large washroom with shower, fridge, TV, great views of the courtyard and Il Duomo. And...the price is right! Affordable rates for superior quality!3) The Staff: To me, this is the final seal on why you should stay at Hotel Europa. I cannot tell you how kind, helpful, generous and warm Gassim  Maria are! (I have not met Miriam but I am sure she is just as wonderful!). A family-run establishment where you are treated with individual attention and care rather than just your typical revolving-door hotel. These people make you feel like you're at home in Italy; their home. By far the nicest people I've met in Italy (and I've travelled the boot from head to toe!).There you have it, short  sweet. Hotel Europa is the place to be when you visit Florence. Go see for yourself!! Arrivederci.......

<Content>Our Home in Florence We spent four nights at the Hotel Europa in July, 2007 and were very happy we chose this hotel. It was clean and we felt it was a true Italian experience with all the modern amenities such as air conditioning, internet access and a very unique elevator. Most of all, it was the three owners that took care of all our needs. Gassim, Miriam and Maria did everything they could possibly do to make our stay a pleasant and enjoyable one. They made us feel as if we were guests in their own home. The location cannot be beat because it is right in the middle of all the activities that we did in Florence.

<Content>Our Favorite Spot and Favorite People! We arrived late one night, excited to be in Florence, yet exhausted. Gassim could not have been more accomodating and pleasant. We truly enjoyed Gassim, Miriam and Maria. They assisted us through the maze of Florence (Miriam even managed to get us an art tour at the last minute!) By the time we left, we felt like we were part of their family. And....our room was the best we stayed in, while visiting Italy. Large, comfortable, good AC, big bathroom with a great shower. I'll never forget opening the shutters to see the top of the dome overlooking a garden....and the bells mingling with the sounds of birds in the morning. We totally recommend this hotel! Please give Gassim and family hugs from their Washington, DC friends!

<Content>Five Star Service We stayed here on a very hot weekend in August. The hotel is amazingly clean with all mod. cons. The service is five star without a doubt. Its a fantastic location and the owners could not have been more 'accommodating' of our needs. Would definately stay here again and recomend.Joanne, Sydney, Australia

<Content>Helpful owners and great location We stayed here for two nights. The owners were really nice and could not be more helpful. The location is fantastic. You can drop your car off for about 20euros/day and walk to anywhere in the city in minutes. The hotel was undergoing some renovation when we were there. This did not disturb us. There was no noise or anything like that just decorating stuff in the corridors. Our room was very clean and practically brand new. They have free online service and an very nice break fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a reasonably price hotel in the center of Florence

<Content>Great location! My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel Europa Firenze in Florence for 2 nights as part of our Italy honeymoon. Prior to actually visiting Florence all of my emails to the hotel were answered promptly and professionally. The staff helped me book reservations for the Accademia and the Uffizzi Gallery. When we arrived at the hotel I initially was a bit concerned going in the front door from the street as it is a dark, not very nicely decorated lobby in a very old building. You have to take a very small lift (only holds 1 person and maybe 2 small suitcases) up to the 2nd floor for the actual hotel reception area. However, once we got to the hotel reception area we were greeted by a very nice gentleman who proceeded to check us in, help us get our luggage to our room, and then show us how to work the lights and air in our room. We found out that the hotel is run by his family-they are all very friendly and helpful. The hotel reportedly just went through renovations. Our room was very clean and it looked like most everything in it was new. It was very simple though with no artwork on the walls....they may be still in the process of adding these. The bathroom also looked newer and was very clean. The bed was VERY firm and so were the pillows....a little too firm for me. They served a simple breakfast in the morning of pastries, meats and cheeses, cereal, fruit, and coffee and bread. They also offered free internet access which was nice. The hotel is in a great location in the center of town only 5 minutes to the Accademia, 5-10 minutes to the Duomo, and a 15 minute walk to the Uffizzi. Even though it was in the center of town our room (50) faced the garden area and was extremely quiet. The air conditioning was very nice too as it was in the high 90's while we were there . Overall I thought this was a good place to stay and I would stay there again if back in Florence.

<Content>Clean, comfortable, charming! We stayed for two nights, lovely people, you feel like you're in their home. Your best bet in Florence is walking, and the Europa is close to everything. It's inexpensive, yet clean and not fancy, but beautiful.But above all, these people stepped up to the plate when I lost my passport and had to wait a day to go to the Embassy to get a copy. I felt cared for and protected in what could have been a very difficult experience. They made all the difference. These are good people, as well as running a fantastic pensione. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. As someone else said, I wish I were there now!

<Content>Good place in a great location Stayed 3 nights from 7/3-7/6. I actually got a newly renovated room on the 2nd floor of the hotel. I was rather apprehensive about my stay as I knew that the hotel was undergoing renovations but were supposed to be finished by the time I arrived. As it turned out, the project was not completed but there were no disturbances either. Everything in my room appeared to be brand new. It was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. The bathroom had a very good shower. When we arrived, we were greeted by Miriam who showed us to the room, explained how things worked, gave us a city map and site seeing and dinner recommendations. She was extremely helpful. Upon arrival, we also discovered that my husband had left his prescription sunglasses on the top of the rental car that we had dropped off at the Florence airport. I contacted EuropeCar, it turned out that they had the glasses. They suggested we have the hotel send Pony Express to get them. Miriam鈥檚 father arranged this for us the next morning and by that afternoon we had them back. The hotel is very well located, walking distance to all the major sites. It is on a busy street but my room faced the courtyard, I could see the dome of the Duomo, and I never heard any street noise. I also really liked Florence a lot.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, wish I were there now. Hotel Europa made our trip to Florence special. Miriam and her father run the hotel and couldn't have made us feel more welcome. The building is 400 years old and you can really enjoy the charm of the hotel itself. Close to major attractions and walking distance to the train terminal about 15 minutes away. Miriam was more than willing to help us in any way she could and we started our correspondence a few months before we even arrived. The rooms are spacious and clean. I would stay at this hotel again without hesitation.

<Content>Perfect in Every Way! After numerous recommendations from a friend that stays at the Europa annually, my wife and I joined Capt. Frank for 3 nights while touring Florence. The location is outstanding and most everything is within walking distance. The 13th century building, complete with it's original murals painted on the ceiling are a much added bonus. With out a doubt this was the most accommodating staff we encountered during our 2 weeks in Italy. Our room was huge and very clean. Miriam, and her family catered to our every need and welcomed us into their home as if we were family. We will return!Capt. Dave and BarbaraPalm Beach Gardens Florida

<Content>Great location, friendly staff After spending over a month reading reviews and searching for hotels in Florence, we chose HOTEL EUROPA for two nights June 14 - 16, 2007 for 150 euros per night (@$204.00 U.S. dollars per night.). We wanted something nice since we were celebrating our 30th Anniversary.We walked from the train station with our luggage (about a 10 minute walk) with no problems. Owners Gassem and Miriam (his daughter) are very gracious, polite and helpful. They take great pride in their hotel which is currently under renovations and recommended an excellent restaurant in Florence: ZaZa.The Hotel is on the 2nd and 3rd floors and you can either climb up two very steep flights of stairs to get to the 2nd floor or you can take the scary elevator which you must operate yourself (room for 2 and some luggage). The main entrance to the elevator is very dark and dreary and can be scary at night especially if traveling alone.We had a lovely renovated room with a king-size bed, beautifully done bathroom with shower with extra jets, and a balcony/terrace that overlooked the Duomo. Our room was in the back for privacy and quiet. Unfortunately, we had to walk through construction area and new bedding in the hallway to get to our room.The problems we encountered were: Our room had no framing/molding around the door so that people in the hall could easily peek into/look into our room. Apparently, they had not finished renovating our room and Gassem said he would have them fix it tomorrow and would try to do something tonight while we went out. When we returned, he had put bubble wrap around the framing so no one could look inside. Another issue was that our balcony had one table and 2 chairs right outside our balcony door. We thought it was private but realized that night when other guests sat outside our bedroom balcony door talking the night away (waking us up) and smoking (left cigarette butts) that there was another entrance. We did not use the balcony because it was full of construction material and debris from renovations. Apparently, this did not bother the other people. Breakfast was average if that - coffee/tea/cappachino, cresonts in wrappers, yogurt and a few cold meats and wrapped processed cheese. Gasshem had offered to switch our room to a room in the front on the main street (noise) and it was not renovated and even though it was less money, it was not something I would want to spend 2 nights in. If we did not say something about the lack of privacy and that people can look into our room, we doubt they would have done anything or even put up the bubble wrap. We feel he should have offered us a discount on our room.Gasshem was very nice in leaving us a bottle of wine on our last night to celebrate our anniversary. Overall, the location and staff are what makes this place. The renovated rooms and bathroom once everything is complete should be very nice. However, with all the hotels in Florence, I would probably opt to stay somewhere else on my next visit. If you choose to stay here, be sure renovations are complete or be sure to get a completely renovated room.

<Content>Warm, Inviting, Close to Everything! This is a little gem of a hotel that was just full of surprises. At first, I was skeptical because it has a rather non-descript facade and is located on a busy main street with scooters galore. And, once you're in the building, the small elevator is barely big enough to hold one person and luggage.But, once you hit the reception desk, all of those concerns disappear.The Europa is family-owned...and every member of the family is focused on providing you with excellent service and a memorable experience. It is also within easy walking distance of almost everything in Florence.The rooms are not fancy but are definitely comfortable. Because most,if not all, of the rooms actually face a courtyard out back, you hearalmost nothing of the main street. Instead, if you're really lucky inchoice of rooms, you'll have an absolutely phenomenal view of the Duomo.While the hotel facilities are nice, it is truly the service that makes the Europa stand out. If I am ever back in Florence, I will definitely stay there again.

<Content>City break in Florence Warm and friendly service in this conveniently located, clean and comfortable hotel. Very central: only a few minutes walk to Duomo andclose to station. A Tourist Information Office is located across the road from the Europa and pleasantly surprised us by providing detailsof where to obtain tickets for the Uffizi Gallery(13 euros). We had thought we had left it too late to gain entrance without queueing endlessly or paying through the nose for a guided tour (about 45 euros). In summer months, it is probably wiser to book ahead online for the Uffizi rather than leave it to chance - I think we were lucky. Buffet breakfast pleasant with varieties of coffee available, though personally would also have enjoyed having coffee making facilities in room. Room and bathroom spacious with good air conditioning system. Have to admit that the 'Suite' category conjuredup something even more exotic. Still, we were satisfied with the reasonable price for a fantastic location in a family run, welcoming and well run hotel.

<Content>Extremely Basic Hotel--Not Sure How It's Ranked 4th in All of Florence I travel frequently and always use Trip Advisor to help select my hotels. As a result, I have had wonderful small hotel experiences in Italy, France, Greece, Switzerland, Norway, the Carribean, the US and many other places. Therefore, I did not hesitate to book the Hotel Europa based on Trip Advisor's glowing reviews. Unfortunately, this time, I was a bit disappointed. This is an extremely basic hotel in need of renovation. I see other reviewers mentioned that their rooms had beem renovated, so perhaps I received one of the not yet renovated rooms. My room had tons of mold growing on the ceiling, cracks in the walls, bed linens and towels that were extremely thin and well worn, and a floor that did not seem to have been swept in ages. I walked across the floor in white socks and they were immediately black on the bottom. During my stay, the ceiling of the room started leaking and it dripped all over the bed, soaking it all. Also, when I arrived, the key to the room had been broken in the lock and they were having a tough time getting the locksmith to come. Therefore, my entire three day stay was spent with a room that wasn't exactly secure. The hotel staff did provide a slight discount on the room for the key and leak issues; I will commend them on that. As for breakfast, I found it to be disappointing after having experienced numerous other amazing hotel breakfasts throughout Europe. The rolls were stale, the croissants came in plastic and were soggy and the cappucino and coffee were subpar. On the positive side, as everyone has said in other reviews, the staff was very nice and tried very hard to make everyone happy. This hotel could very well become a hidden gem with some work and maintenance. Until then, I'm very surprised that this hotel ranks 4th in Florence.

<Content>Great staff, location, value After reading great reviews about this family-owned hotel, we booked them for two nights during our Italian honeymoon. It's in an old building with high ceilings and the lobby is on the 2nd floor, away from the noisy streets below.Our host (I think her name was Miriam?) was so gracious and nice. She upgraded our room since we were on our honeymoon. We had a huge room with those big, shuttered windows you picture in Tuscany. So romantic. The room was clean and spacious. Also, the hotel is just two blocks or so from the Duomo and maybe a 10 min. walk from the train station. Very centrally located. They have a great breakfast buffet and free internet access which is a treat when traveling abroad. I'd definitely recommend them!

<Content>Great Location Hotel Europa was a great place to stay in Florence. It was a five minute walk to the Duomo and many other attractions in the beautiful city. We booked a suite which was only a little extra, and well worth it. My husband and I stayed in the Donatella suite. It was nicely decorated with a modern bathroom. The windows opened to the a nice quiet garden area, so although we were in the centre of the city, we were still able to retreat from the hustle bustle when needed. The hotel owners (a young family) were also very friendly and spoke english, which was helpful. They provided us with maps and details on how to get to the main tourist attractions, as well as recommended a very nice restaurant, Za Za (gorgeous steak!!).My only complaint would be the entrance of the hotel - it seemed kinda dark and dingy, and you have to take and old styled lift up to the first floor for the suites and the second floor to the other rooms - which was a bit of a hassle. Your could also take the stairs but its a bit hard with luggage.Overall, a very pleasant stay and would highly recommend it.

<Content>Such a pleasant surprise We chose this hotel because of other reviews and price. Upon arriving, you see that you must reach the 2nd floor for the actual hotel. No problem. Lift is tiny, but it works fine. Our room was a huge triple room with a king bed and a twin. Good bedding and linens. Our bathroom was huge, with a large shower with plenty of hot water and large towels. The air conditioning was excellent.The breakfast was ample: hot coffees and teas, juices, yogurt, cereals, pastries, cheeses, meats, and breads. Not elaborate, but very nice. The family that runs this hotel are delightful. They were so kind and went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. Everything we needed was provided. This hotel has a quiet location, yet a 5-10 minute walk from all the main attractions.The facilities were very clean. This is not a fancy place, but if you want a clean, comfortable room, with great location and the best service anywhere, the Hotel Europa in Florence is the place for you. We would definitely come back to this hotel again.

<Content>Stay HERE! I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Miriam and her parents, who have owned the hotel for over 40 years (Miriam grew up there) are warm and friendly. There is nothing that is too much trouble. They were completing renovations while we were there, so we were the first to sleep in our beds and the first to use our showers. Miriams suggestions were always spectacular. Having been to 5 other cities in Italy, we felt quite authenticated, but ZaZa blew us away! Since Florence was experiencing an unusal heat wave for June, and it was Monday with most museums closed, Miriam found a fantastic excursion for us -- a horseback trip through Tuscany with lunch at a winery in a castle. The guide was a young energetic and elegant man named Sami and he was kind enough to accomodate us with 30 minutes notice. He even sent a taxi to our hotel to pick us up at his expense. It turned out to be one of our favorite days in Italy. The lunch consisted of gnocci with white truffles, and some fabulous wines. We purchased the yummy dessert wine and have already almost depleted it!! When Miriam's dad discovered that my son had a preference for Iced Cappicinno, he personally prepared it for him throughout our visit. He treated our kids as if they were his own family. Miriams children were also present thoughout our visit, helping at the front desk and visiting with their grandparents in the living room. The location was perfect - nearby the Duomo, the Academia, the Midici Chapels (which, by the way, are under renonvation). But Florence is small enough to walk anywhere and EVERYWHERE each day. Also, do not be put off by the non-descript entrance - the building used to be a foundry, which gives it its charm. Just hop the antique elevator (lift) one or two floors up to the hotel. You may also walk the steps. this place is a gem in every respect. Bravo!!

<Content>Very Enjoyable Experience We stayed at Hotel Europa for 3 nights in June and were both very impressed. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room (we stayed in one of the suites) was large and very clean, as was the bathroom. Location was excellent, 100 metres to the cathedral. Overall would recommend the Hotel.

<Content>excellent budget hotel - an outstanding value Hotel Europa is an outstanding value for a budget-conscious traveler. The room (we stayed in #36) was comparatively large, romantic, clean, and charming. The bathroom is quite large as well. It's a smaller family-run operation, and we didn't mind at all a lack of room service, 24 hour desk personnel, etc that larger properties charge for in their room costs.The hotel sits on a VERY busy  noisy street that takes about a 5 minute walk to get to the Duomo. The rooms on the rear of the hotel are totally quiet however. I would much rather have a short walk to the center of things than pay double at another property that is 3 minutes closer  on the other side of the Duomo Square.During our stay Florence had an unusual heat wave. It was in the mid-90s and sticky/humid. If you dislike those kind of temperatures (I know some people love them), make sure your room air-conditioning is working well, and if need be left on after housekeeping comes through.Our biggest disappointment in Florence had nothing to do with the hotel. It was the restaurants. We live just outside San Francisco and think we have better Italian food here than at the restaurants we tried in Florence. Our favorite dining experiences involved little cafes with a more casual light food/wine bar offering - as compared to the full sit-down restaurants. But.....each to his own I guess. We did not like Za-Zas at all. We really enjoyed Procacci  Gran Cafe San Marco.Miriam, Robert,  Gassim are all very nice hosts. The open air markets are fun  offer some good buys. Of course, the history  museums are fantastic.

<Content>Great hospitality It wasn't the location of the hotel or the actual room that impressed us the most during our stay at Hotel Europa in Florence. It was the management that made the experience memorable. They always went out of their way to make us comfortable and assisted us in every way possible. My husband and I won't hesitate to stay at Hotel Europa again if we are fortunate enough to return to Florence.

<Content>We left our hearts in Florence Hotel Europa is 5 Star *****There's no pool or jaccuzi, no gym, no sauna, no doorman and I don't think there was room service. Do you care when you're in one of the most beautiful and alive cities in the world? We wouldn't have used any of those services anyway. On our honeymoon we wanted to take the time to experience all the city had to offer, and know that we had a safe, secure, comfortable and VERY friendly home away from home to come back to as a home base. Gassem and Miriam made sure that anything we needed was provided and it was great getting to know them and seeing their positive energy at the front desk and the breakfast buffet. At the time we were there (first week of June) there semed to be new furniture arriving, so must be upgrading the rooms. We had unit #35 for $150 E a night which is reasonable and well worth it. We had a small fridge in the room which was nice for a holding snacks and happy hour supplies. The shower and bathroom were immaculate as was the hotel in general. First appearance and the sight of the little freight elevator could be a shock to some at first, but it's all part of the charm and adventure. Would go back again and miss it already. The location is the best and YES walking to the train with your luggage is easy.

<Content>Highly recommended I stayed here with my parents and booked 2 rooms. The rooms were very clean and cozy. I liked the beautifully painted furniture. People there were quite kind. The location was great. I think it's quite hard to find better hotel with this price in Florence. You will find it's an expensive city but if you stay here, at least you can feel the hotel price is quite reasonable. If I visit this city again, I will book this hotel for sure.Sasaki

<Content>Lousy Breakfast, Creepy Building, Decent Room and City Location. If I had written this review immediately after we got back to the U.S. last October 2006, I would have given them a 2...but time has tempered my disappointments.Let's start w/ the good:1. Pretty decent location...no complaints really when you look at it from a price/location standpoint. Better hotels in Florence? You bet. Cleaner...better rooms? Sure! I think though you'd be hard-pressed to have a decent room in this location at this price.2. Room itself was a suite at the end of the hallway...I forget the number. Windows opened out into a courtyard...(no view to speak of). Pretty big room though and bathroom was quite large (by their standards), clean, just fine.3. They have an ice machine from which you can get ice any time of day. Believe me...this was a godsend. It allows you to buy sodas/whatever and drink them COLD...and that's no small feat when looking for ice in Italy!The not-so-good:1. The breakfast is lousy. I don't drink coffee, but those that did raved about the self-serve espresso machine and how good the coffee was. I literally ate nothing for breakfast at the hotel the 5 days we were there.2. Lufthansa lost my luggage in Florence. For the first 2 days, front desk did very little to aid my effort to find and get the bags. Ended up going back and forth to the Florence airport 3 round-trips to straighten things out w/ Lufthansa! $30.00 each time, each way.3. Couldn't really open the windows in the room for fresh air because of mosquitoes. Bug traps/killers were empty of attractant and were never filled while we were there.4. Furnishings in the room, including bed linens are really worn...cobwebs/spider webs hung from ceiling corners.5. 1 English-speaking channel on the TV....CNN We Hate America International.A couple other notes:1. I can't believe anyone would say this hotel is walking distance to the main train station. I would NEVER walk the distance w/ luggage...I don't care how young you are. We did walk the distance several times on day trips to/from the station, but we are in our 40's w/ no kids and that was w/ no luggage. Got luggage? TAKE A CAB!!!...and have Gassem or someone else call them for you!2. Everything was within walking distance of this hotel. Florence just didn't strike me as that big, so we walked everywhere.3. The area was sort-of creepy at night...but then again I never felt scared/nervous probably because compared to the folks I saw, I felt like a GIANT at 6'0 and 195 lbs and completely scary-bald.Would I stay here again? I still can't answer that.

<Content>Great Place Hotel Europa was a great place to stay while exploring Florence. I would recommend it to all ages, any couple- young or old, and any family. Pluses- great decor in rooms, larger breakfast, location, staff, their willingness to book reservations for museums etc before arriving (this is a must in Florence for the Uffize and David)Minus-at the moment the lower floor is being renovated and we had to book a suite (which was still only 150 euros)I have two great restaurant recommendations from a friend who studied in Florence-Acqua al Due- Via dei Acqua ( Between Ghibellina and Via Vechia- very close to the Bargello) -They have a steak with an amazing blueberry balsamic sauceIl Gato e Le Volpe- its also on Ghibellina just past the bargelloGreat food, prices, and large portions. This is one of the few restaurants you can leave full from without breaking the bank. Great for lunch or dinner.

<Content>Comfortable, great location Great location, comfortable, well-decorated large room with every amenity. Spotlessly clean and well-managed by a concerned family staff. Gassim and Miriam were very attentive and together with their family provided assistance and guidance when needed. Lower lobby under construction did not interfere with stay. Elevator, air conditioning,and very nice breakfast including meats, cheeses and an assortment of pastries and fresh rolls. No problems. Would recommend without concern!

<Content>Nice hotel in good location We stayed in Hotel Europa for 3 nights in May. We had a suite room which had two large windows that gave us a nice quiet view. We could even see the very top of the Duomo Dome and Giotto's Bell Tower. The room was large with a high ceiling. It was very nicely decorated and clean. We are still amazed at the window treatment : shutters+glass panels + wooden clapboards + sheers + curtains. Wow! We were impressed.Breakfast included hard-boiled eggs, cold cuts and cheese, croissant, Kellogg's corn flakes and cocoa krispies, juice, fruit, yogurt, rolls and toast. Gassim was a gracious host and made a wonderful cup of cappuccino.There was a computer with Internet access in the lobby which allowed us to get in touch with our family. The location is very convenient - about a 5 minute walk to the Accademia, the Duomo and the Medici Chapels and 15 minute walk to the Uffizi. Getting to the SMN train station was easy too- we just took the bus (#1, #7 or #17) at the stop right across the street.Overall we were very happy with this hotel

<Content>miriam is a gem we stayed at the europa in april. when i called and spoke to miriam directly she couldn't have been more helpful. she even called me back to work out a problem with our reservation -twice!!the rooms are very large and clean ,freshly painted. beds are comfortable. rooms are quiet. bathrooms are large and clean,towels are fluffy .breakfast is good miriam's dad puts out a good spread inc. hard boiled eggs. while in florence we realized we were going to have to do some laundry. miriam's husband called the laundry had our stuff picked up washed, dried, and folded and returned for 20 euro!! and that was for two large large plastic bags full!there is a p.c. in the common room/living room that you can use for free.the location can't be beat. it is central to everything and across the street from the medici palace.2 blocks to san marco 2 blocks to the duomo and a 10 minute walk to the uffizi.there is a wonderful little spot for inexpensive meals just around the corner called the o.k. bar.i would return in a heart beat.

<Content>Wonderful hotel - made our trip Stayed at the Hotel Europa for just a couple of nights on our whirlwind week inNorthern Italy, but it was one of the best things about the trip. I echo the comments of other reviewers here - Gassim and Miriam, who own and staff the hotel, were wonderful and very accommodating. They gave us our choice of two different rooms, provided recommendations for touring the city and restaurants, and arranged tickets/tours for us. The room was very spacious, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was sparkling, and we even had a partial view of the Duomo. The hotel is central to everything in Florence. The breakfast was also very good, and there is a computer in the lobby for internet access. This was our first trip to Europe, and Gassim and Miriam did their best to make us feel comfortable - we even got stories about some of the famous people who had stayed in our room in years past! Highly recommended

<Content>Peaceful with fabulous comfy beds My mum and I have just returned from 6 nights at this lovely hotel.The simple and elegant decor really makes you feel at home - as do Gassim and Miriam, who run the family firm.From the moment we arrived they made is feel welcome and helped us with maps, bookings, restaurant choices, etc.We stayed in a suite (room 32) which is a large room with the comfiest bed I have ever stayed in. The shuttered window opens out to a pleasant and peaceful courtyard.The room was very clean and thoroughly tidied every day.The shower was was hot and fast and there were always plenty towels.Breakfast is basic, but adequate.The hotel is just minutes from the Duomo and less then 15 mins walk from the river, Uffizi and the Academia, where the statue of David is.We would also recommend walking up hills beyond the river for great views of the city.Day trips to Siena, Lucca and Pisa are advised. They are all lovely and the train ride is incredibly scenic - if slow.There are hundreds of good restaurants nearby. The hotel recommended ZaZA. It served excellent food, the best we had. But beware, staff booted another couple of their seats to accommodate us (we were mortified) and they overcharged for two items. But just beware - do go... the food really is first class.You have to book well ahead to get a seat outside.I would recommend the Europa to family and friends who visit Florence.

<Content>2 star hotel, 4 star service! We have just returned from a 3 night break at the Europa. The staff couldn't be more helpful, as was seen from all the positive comments in the visitors book on leaving.I was a little worried about the proximity of the hotel to a main road (Via Cavour) on arriving, but all the rooms are at the the back and very quiet. You open the windows on waking up, and all you can hear is the sound of swifts flying around (well, at least until the workmen start on the ongoing renovation on the 2nd floor around 8am - which was OK)!The location of the hotel is absolutely brilliant, just a few minutes from the Duomo, so close to pretty much anything you want to see in central Florence.The corridors and main rooms have been very attractively done, and give the hotel a great ambience  character. Miriam the receptionist was more than happy to pre-book tickets and reserve tables even before we arrived in Italy so that we did not even have to engage our brains but could just kick back and enjoy our trip without the hassle.

<Content>Great Experience We stayed at the Hotel Europa for several days during a recent trip to Italy. It was wonderful - very clean and updated facilities, good breakfast, great location, free internet access, etc. But the best part of the stay, definitely was the staff. The hotel is run by a father and daughter who were both very welcoming and helpful. I'd definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Top everthing! The Hotel Europa was the first of five hotels my mother and I stayed at on our trip through Tuscany and Umbria and it set the mark so high that none of the others was able to come close. I can only rave about everything. Our room was beautifully decorated, spotless, and completely quiet despite its central location. The mattresses were excellent (and I am picky). Water pressure was great and hot water plentiful. The breakfast buffet was more than ample (with great coffee and even a better smile from Gassim).Which brings me to the real selling point of the hotel--the staff. Gassim, Miriam and her husband (I believe his name is Robert) are by far the best hosts I've ever experienced, and I do travel a lot. I arrived in Florence at 6:30 am after an overnight train ride. My room wasn't ready yet, but Gassim let me leave my luggage at the hotel, freshen up in the common restroom, and sit down in the lobby/ living room area til I was up to facing the city. Then, armed with the map he provided me with, I was off to explore. When we left three days later, Miriam also let us keep out bags there, and when we came back to get them, provided us with juice and sweets before we left. Everyone we came in contact with, from the housekeepers to Miriam's lovely daughters, shared their genuine smiles and hellos with us. They went beyond being hosts-- I left with the feeling of wishing I had more time to get to know them better.And all this for the best price in Florence. What more could you want?

<Content>Loved the Hotel Europa! The Hotel Europa in Florence was outstanding! The rooms were larger than most in Europe. They were clean, neat, and attractive. I think the location was excellent. The most outstanding part of the hotel though was Mr. Gassim and his family who manage the hotel. They were so friendly, pleasant and accomodating! We enjoyed breakfast upstairs each day and enjoyed talking with them. When we go to Florence again, we will surely stay here!

<Content>Home away from home! After spending 3 harrowing days in Rome, we arrived at our hotel in Florence. Miriam's warm smile and gracious nature was a welcome relief. She quickely ushered us to our room, which was large by European standards. The room had nice windows with a good view, was impeccably clean, and incredibly comfortable beds! The shower was great, a nice very huge stand-up! Good location as we were within a 10 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio yet the hotel was in a quiet area. There was no street noise at night. Throughout our stay both Gassim and Miriam were wonderful. They provided us with all the info we needed, helped us with making reservations at museums, assisted us with bus and train tickets, and gave recommendations to great restaurants. I can't say enough about how great Gassim and Miriam were. This is a rare gem of a hotel, a family run business, and you can tell they take pride in giving good service and making sure that your stay in Florence is memorable and stress-free. Plus the price can't be beat, although they could charge double and it would still be worth it. We will definitely stay here again!!! The Mason Family

<Content>Perfect hotel in Florence! My husband, 17 year old son and I chose to stay in the Hotel Europa for six days in March after hearing my sister rave about how much she loved the hotel when she stayed here last October. She did not exaggerate what a great hotel this is. We found the hotel to be spotlessly clean, very comfortable with large spacious rooms. and ideally located right in the center of things, but away from the noise. We had a suite with painted ceilings that were incredible, rooms that were just huge and a terrific multi jet shower. The best feature though is Miriam and her father. They are both gracious hosts who make you feel welcome immediately. We received great advice on where to dine and reservations were happily made for us (definitely try Zaza's and Il Latino). When we unexpectedly extended our stay, Miriam managed to work out a way to accomodate us. And, when we had time to kill before our flight took off, we were welcomed into the lounge room where we were able to comfortably relax, use the computer and await our departure time in a friendly, homey environment. This hotel reflects the standards of days gone by with excellent service, large rooms, great breakfast , the ability to converse in multiple languages and genuine concern and interest in the guests. I cannot say enough about this hotel. There is no doubt that when we return to Florence, we will stay here with our new friends, Miriam and Gassim. Thank you both for making our stay so wonderful!ps - shoppers tip : the prices in the market right near the hotel are cheaper than the market in piazza del repubblica, plus the selection is greater.

<Content>Very nice Staff First of all, the staff at this hotel is Well Above Average. Very nice folks. We stayed in a nice room, but had some problems with check in. We were told to come on in and they'd help us find where to take our rental car. However, when we arrived there were no English-speakers to be found. I wouldn't normally find that a problem, except that they had assured us to park at the front and they'd help us. We parked semi-illegally due to their advice and it was quite a struggle to find the rental car place.After the initial problem, there were no other set-backs. They did an excellent job with my husband's laundry. We also REALLY enjoyed the free internet. It was right in the middle of our trip, so being able to contact home was a terrific perk.I would stay there again if I was going to be on the same budget. They gave us a complimentary bottle of wine on the way out that has become one of our favorite Chiantis. In fact, we pick up a bottle when we want to re-live our trip.Florence is an awesome city. This hotel is worth every penny. I would definitely recommend it as a perfect hotel in this price range.

<Content>A wonderful experience Just returned from a four day break to Florence and we just had to complement the Hotel Europa for a fantastic stay.Miriam and her father Gassim were the perfect hosts, extremely helpful and friendly, and nothing was too much trouble. It was my birthday the day we arrived and after spotting this at check in Gassim delivered a complimentary bottle of wine to our room with his usual smiling face.The hotel rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The location is superb with all major attractions less than 15 minutes walk.Miriam recommended a restaurant called Za Za (and took care of the reservation) and we would highly recommend it to visitors.The hotel is a simple two star with five star service. Don鈥檛 be put off by the entrance or lift!

<Content>Perfect Start to Italy We just got back from a dream trip to Italy. Thanks Trip Advisor/members for helping us pick and choose hotels. Just found this site before we left....it really works. Case in point, Hotel Europa. Charming hotel, gracious staff (Miriam and her father were the epitome of class) and central location. After huge days of museums,food gorging and late night walks across the city, the clean, quiet and friendly Europa is what the soul needed. I could go on and on. Book it.

<Content>The best hotel in Florence I visited Hotel Europa in February and had a fantastic time. The location of the hotel couldn't be more perfect and the service provided by the staff there is the best I have ever experienced. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence.

<Content>Friendly, clean, efficient, reasonable rates When my family arrived in Florence in December 2006, we wanted to find a reasonably priced hotel, close to the centre of the city.We could walk to the Hotel Europa from the Florence train station.Hotel Europe met all our requirements - and more.We could walk to see the Duomo, the Medici Palaces, the Ponte Vecchio, the Statue of David etc, etc. My daughter and I enrolled in a two weeks Italian language course while we were in Florence.The hotel staff even helped us with out Italian language studies.The family who run the hotel have now beome our friends. We thoroughly recommend the Hotel Europa.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Had a great time in hotel europa, it is ideally situated right in the heart of florence and close to all the shops, museums and the market etc, we stayed for three nights and could easily get to anywhere we wanted in florence very quickly from our hotel, hotel europa is a very nice family run hotel and obviously take great pride in the way they look after their guests very personally with an emphasis on making guests feel very welcome, this was my first ever trip to italy and i couldnt of picked a more beautifull city or a nicer hotel, i will definitely be visiting again.

<Content>Loved the location of Hotel Europa! My daughter, teenage granddaughters, and I had a very positive experience at the Hotel Europa in February. We had two large rooms with king sized beds and tiled floors. The rooms were quiet , clean, and at the end of a hall. Kassim and Meriam were great hosts---very pleasant and helpful. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfasts each morning, but best of all was the perfect location near the train station, museums, and churches. As stated in some other reviews, it might be a little hard to find because of the placement of the sign, and it was up one set of stairs (elevator being repaired); however, we felt very safe and comfortable at the Hotel Europa. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a great location!

<Content>Loved the Hotel Europa Excellent location within easy walking distance to all the major sites. We stayed in a suite, which was a clean, large room. Friendly staff. What more could you ask for. The only downfall was breakfast, but this is the off season.

<Content>Highly Recommended We stayed at Hotel Europa in late February and thought it was a great value. The room was large and very clean. Our room was also very quiet. The location of the hotel is excellent -- 5 minute walk form either the Accademia or the Duomo, 10 minutes from Uffizzi. The proprietors were very friendly, spoke English (a + for us) and helped us with museum and restaurant reservations. We drove into town, which was a bit of hassle -- make sure you print the directions to the hotel from their website -- and did not locate any parking near the hotel -- but, we parked along the road in front of the hotel briefly (heading towards the Duomo) and the hotel staff took the keys, called a parking service, and arranged overnight parking for 20 Euro, a very convenient service if you have a car.

<Content>Great Stay in Florence We had a great stay at the Europa this past week. Great hospitality and had the benefit of an upgrade to a suite due to construction on the standard double room floor. In spite of several prior posts about towel and pillow quality, I was very happy with both. As noted, driving into Florence (first time visitors) and finding the hotel took a few loops around town before finding Via Cavour. Closeness to major sites is as advertised. In our book, Florence was more enjoyable than Rome. Good restaurant to try is Acqua al 2.

<Content>hotel europa i promised myself i would write a short review of this very nice hotel close to the duomo and center of town. while the breakfast left someting to be desired we were able to book a large two bedroom suite that could accomodate our family. this was something of a rarity since we typically had to pay for two hotel rooms on most of our trip to italy and austria. the hotel staff was incredibly friendly, the price was reasonalble and the room we stayed in had a 300 year old fresco on the ceiling!!-- i would definitely recommend this hotel to families that are travelling in florence.mark pinnie

<Content>Wonderful experience! Hotel Europa was by far the best hotel I stayed at during my study abroad experience in Europe. Eight-teen other students and myself felt right at home when staying at Hotel Europa. The owner, Gassim, and his family run the hotel and make you feel as if you are a part of the family as well. The hotel was clean and comfortable! I highly recommend it!!

<Content>Perfect Place We stayed at the Hotel Europa Suites for 4 nights and had 2 rooms for our party. Location was absolutely perfect - across from the Medicic Palace and a few blocks from the Duomo. Rate at the time was 100 euros per night. Rooms were spotless, roomy and decoarted beautifully. Windows were large and overlooked a courtyrad with trees and birds singing. Although on a busy street, rooms were exceptionally quiet. Hotel had a/c and an elevator. Owner and his daughter extremely helpful and hospitable - we were treated like honored quests. We highly recommend this hotel for your Florence stay.

<Content>Charming, clean and quiet I highly reccomend the Hotel Europa. The rooms are clean, beautifully (recently refurbished) and quiet. This is very unusual for the center of Florence. The owner, Mr. Gissim, is charming, and helps to make your stay in Florence a delight.Furthermore, it is great value for money,JVB, Milan

<Content>Great location, excellent service, clean We booked directly with the hotel after doing much research for price, location, and hotel ratings. We were not disappointed. The room was large with simple decor, and we had a small patio that gave us a glimpse of the Duomo. The biggest plusses for the hotel are the great location between the Duomo and the Acadamia, the very clean rooms, and the very helpful staff. The other reviewers are right about that! For full disclosure we should mention the unpleasant smell in the entryway of the building prior to entering the actual hotel - but no unpleasant odor in the actual hotel. Also, our particular bathroom had no separate shower enclosure. The water simply sprayed onto the bathroom floor and went down a drain in the floor. Still, we highly recommend it.

<Content>Excellent, well-located hotel My friend and I stayed here in early December and it was an absolutely wonderful experience. The hotel is well-located and well-priced, and I cannot say enough about the staff/owners. They were so pleasant and helpful. Miriam booked us gallery reservations in advance and personally recommended wonderful restaurants (you must go to Trattoria ZaZa!). When we asked the front desk where the nearest store was so that we could purcahse some bottled water, the owner insisted that he give us a big bottle of water for free. In the States, that would have costed us 10 bucks in a hotel! The morning breakfast was pleasant. The room was beautiful and overlooked a little courtyard. You could see the dome of the Duomo from our room. The bathroom was huge! We did splurge and get a deluxe room. But, it was still only 115 Euros!!! This was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had and I travel a lot! I highly recommend this hotel!!!!

<Content>Lovely Hosts - definitely recommend! This hotel was spacious, clean and very well located near the Duomo. We were given a room with a balcony and with a view of the Duomo. It was actually the hosts of this hotel which impressed us most. When we arrived on the first day, tired and sleepy, my partner and I were greeted by a warm smile and a nice cappacino. We were convinced that Hotel Europa definitely had a 5 star service. The Hotel is not grand but it meets our need for comfort. We have stayed in a lot of hotels around the world but this is definitely recommended. The service is very personal, breakfast is sumptuous and you do feel like you are treated as a valuable guest. Don't look elsewhere in Florence, the hosts will take good care of you like they did us. We will definitely be back!Hi to Miriam and her family - all the best!!

<Content>Great place I stayed here Oct. 22-24. This is a great place owned by a wonderful family. They are so friendly and helpful. They suggested great places to eat at and suggested things to do. The hotel was a little difficult to find on my own (you'll be okay if you take a taxi directly there - which is what I should have done). The hotel is actually in a great location - very close to many of the main attractions. I stayed in a regular (not newly renovated) room and it was fine - but if you stay in one of the newly renovated rooms, you'll be pleasantly surprised. A nice bonus was the availability of internet at the hotel (and not having to venture off to find an internet cafe). The owners/family are wonderful and service was top-notch. I'd definitely stay here again. - Holly

<Content>Enjoyed this quaint hotel This is a fabulous little hotel in a great location - easy walking distance to all that Florence offers. The family that runs the hotel is friendly and helpful. We booked a suite and found it to be quite spacious - we loved the decor. The bathroom was big, the shower was great... we heard no street noise at night. The only issue we had was a couple of mosquitoes in our room. I would stay here again and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel with lots of charm and character.

<Content>Tremendous Location, Basic but very Clean Hotel This was a very basic hotel, but clean and comfortable, and the location was excellent. People should understand that it was not luxurious in any way, but you are not paying luxury rates. We were in a regular room. The bathroom was incredibly small. The shower was just a corner of the room, with a drain in the floor. The worst part was that the curtain would stick to you, as it was so small you couldn鈥檛 help but bump into it. We found it a bit odd that the room had completely bare walls, not a picture on them (it鈥檚 a completely minor point; just seems it would feel a bit warmer with something there).The family that owns it is very friendly and helpful. We asked about a restaurant, and she picked up the phone and made us reservations. Breakfast was very good (of course, they had Nutella, and that鈥檚 very good in my book!).

The family is wonderful and the hotel is in the most perfect location for the first time visit. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is going to florence. I love the elevator, the stairs , the family and the rooms and my room was great. soooo, my only suggestion, get a map. a little tough to find. but worth it. suellen

<Content>Great times in Florence We stayed at the Europa with a group of six and had the most pleasant time. The entry and second floor reception threw us a bit but we were pleasantly surprised when we got to the second floor and saw our rooms.The hosts were excellent and very helpful. The rooms were more than adequate and the large room at the front was brillant. (Ask for this one if you can.)Breakfast was very nice and plenty of it. The coffee machine ran all the time becasue it was very nice. we appreciated the free internet at the front counter which was very convienient. Location is great. If you arrvie by train it is about a twenty minute walk. We did it with our suitcases but I would probably suggest a cab.I would definately recommend the Europa to anyone.

<Content>a hotel where you're treated like family I was traveling alone and stayed here for 4 days. I had no tours or anything planned for what to do with those days. The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful. They pointed out things I could do and arranged for several day trips to Pisa and another one hiking in the countryside. When I said I had to see museums since I was in Florence, I didn't think I would be able to get into anything without reservations weeks ahead of time. Again they came through and told me to go see the David when the Accademia opened at 8:15, then arranged for me to get on another tour to see the Uffizi. Anytime I needed any help, they were there with suggestions of where to eat and directions on how to find places. When I would come back to the hotel, they would always greet me with a big smile and call me by name.They said I was family and treated me as such. Traveling alone this was a wonderful bonus. I traveled for a week and then returned to Florence, back to the Hotel Europa where I was greeted like a long lost relative. It was absolutely wonderful how they made me feel. The hotel is located near the Duomo so whenever I had to go somewhere, I could easily find how to get back by locating the Duomo and then walking the 1 and 1/2 blocks to the hotel. I loved the location, I could see the Duomo out my window. I had a huge room and just loved the whole time I spent there. I have never experienced such a feeling of being at home in a hotel. It was great.

<Content>Great value for money! This was the second part of our honeymoon and the hotel owner welcomed us with a bottle of wine. All of the staff were very friendly and very helpful, the owner recommended a great little area to eat. The room was spotless, very spacious and very comfortable. I can't believe that this is only a 2 star hotel. I would highly recommend it and next time we're in Florence we will definately be staying there.

<Content>Highly recommended! The Hotel Europa is a wonderful find, especially for the price. We were greeted with such warmth by the owner himself, Gasim, even though we arrived quite late. He quickly had our rental car taken car of (fare price) for the duration of our visit. Our suite was so large and with ceilings painted as beautiful as many in the famous homes surrounding us. We were on the front of the building, but the windows kept out any noise from the street. The bathroom was modern and everthing was very clean. Our host greated us for breakfast each morning and he and his family were ready to help with our variety of needs (tours, directions, recommendations, etc.). The location of the hotel was perfect for most all the sites as well. The hotel lobby is on the 2nd floor which we later found to be very common in Europe (at least in Italy).

<Content>Good Location, Excellent Value The Europa is conveniently located between the Duomo and the Accademia. Also, we, as seniors travelling light, had no difficulty walking to the train station, perhaps ten minutes distant. Gassem and Miriam (management) were most helpful and solicitous, and spoke excellent English, too. Our bedroom and bath accommodations were clean and comfortable, and the breakfast spread was good. The Europa was our best value on our trip, which also included stopovers in Verona, Venice and Rome. I will recommend the Europa to my friends.

<Content>Great hotel, Great owners! We stayed at the Hotel Europa for 5 nights in early November. The hotel is located on the 2nd  3rd floor of the building. The location was great, very central to everything. About a 5 minute walk to the Duomo. We walked all over the city with no problems. The street that the hotel is on is fairly busy, but we didn鈥檛 hear any noise from inside the hotel. There is someone at the desk from 7am to 1am which was also nice. We had the Raphael suite. It was nicely decorated and fairly large. There was plenty of room for 2 large suitcases with room to move around. The room was very very clean as well. There is also a computer to use by the reception desk, free of charge, which was really nice.Miriam  Gassim were wonderful. They bent over backwards to make our stay pleasant. Gassim greeted me every morning by name. Miriam recommended a company to use for a day trip to Siena, which was great. She even made all the arrangements. She also made museum and dinner reservations for us during our stay. They really work hard to make sure all your needs are met.The breakfast was good. I loved the coffee machine. Breakfast included cereal, croissants, bread, hard boiled eggs, cheese and fruit. They also had nutella, my favorite!! I had it every morning on my croissant. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel. The location is great, it鈥檚 very clean and most of all Miriam  Gassim were just so nice and eager to make our stay great.Try the Accademia restaurant just down the street. It was the best meal we had in Florence.Thanks Miriam  Gassim!

<Content>A wonderful find The Hotel Europa in Florence was perfect for us. We were there for three nights in October, 2006. The highlight was the hospitality of the family that operates this small hotel. The hotel is a short walk from the train station and a short walk to all the major sights in Florence. The family made reservations for the key museums so that we had no waiting in the long lines. They also recommended a fine modestly priced restaurant to which we returned two evenings. Coffee was available at any time and the breakfasts were beyond the usual continental fare. They also allowed use of the computer at no charge and helped with directions and reservations for the rest of our trip. The rooms are modest but are clean and with all necessary amenities. All this at a very modest price for a major city like Florence.  Julie and Steve Albertalli Big Flats, NY

<Content>Couldn't Have Asked for More We had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Europa October 14-20, 2006. Everything was wonderful, from the location, rooms, cleanliness, and hospitality. There were 6 in our group. We had suite rooms that were located on the first (second in America) floor. Also on our floor was a nice sitting room where we could have a bottle of wine and discuss our day or where we were going to dine that evening. Breakfast was more than adequate. I would love to have a coffee maker like the one in the dining room. It was self serve and one could choose from espresso, cafe Americano, cappichino, or latte. Everything was within walking distance of the hotel. The only time we took a bus was to go to Fiesole and the bus stop was only a couple of blocks away. The owners couldn't have been more helpful. One night when we asked for some plastic glasses to drink our wine, they insisted on giving us more proper glasses in which to enjoy the bottle. There was even a small refrigerator in the desk. We would definitely return to the Hotel Europa on future visits.

<Content>An excellent place to stay in Florence My wife and I recently spent 3 nights at the Europa and consider it the best accommodation we stayed in during a recent month in Europe. The owner (Gassim) and his staff were extremely obliging and nothing appeared to be too much trouble. Our room towards the rear of the hotel was very quiet, comfortable, clean and very tastefully decorated. The central location was an excellent base from which to explore Florence and was close to the station and bus depots. Breakfasts were more than adequate.

<Content>Great Hotel! This hotel was great .. the staff was super friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable and the breakfast each morning was great. The best part about the hotel was that it situated right in the middle of Florence. We were able to walk to all of the sights and Miriam was so great about telling us which things we should see and the good places to eat. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely go back.

<Content>5 Star service Our family (3 persons) stayed at the Hotel Europa for 6 nights in September. This was, by far, the best hotel experience we have had during our Italy travels. The location was excellent with easy walking access to the train station and all central sites. The suites (one double and one single) looked out on a quiet courtyard and were large, well appointed and quiet. From the time we arrived, we were welcomed and treated royally by Miriam, Gassim and the rest of the family. Each morning we had a lovely breakfast - Gassim makes the best cappucino! Each evening, Miriam and Gassim made sure we were supplied with ice packs and water as one of our party had a troublesome foot that needed constant attention. Our stay was delightful. Miriam was especially helpful with recommendations on where to shop for specific items and best restaurants for wonderful local dishes at great prices. All our requests were handled quickly and we were provided with excellent information about day trips and other sight seeing options. We will absolutely stay with them the next time we are in Florence and will recommend Hotel Europa to all our friends. Thank you ,Gassim and Miriam, for a wonderful stay with your family. Florence will always hold a special place for us due to your kindness and hospitality.

<Content>Great Experience at the Europa! Our room at the Europa was huge by European standards, spotless and comfortable. It was nicely decorated. Our bed was comfortable with good support. The bathroom had a shower with plenty of hot water and good pressure. The location was ideal. Although less than five minutes from the Duomo and on a busy street, our room was perfectly quiet thanks to being on the courtyard and its double-paned soundproof windows. We had a lovely view of red-tiled roofs and windowsill gardens. The breakfast featured unlimited excellent coffee, homemade granola, other cereals, croissants, meat, cheese, yogurt, juice, toast and hard boiled eggs. It was a better breakfast than our other, more expensive hotels in Rome and Florence. The staff was very friendly, helpful and completely fluent in English. They cheerfully did all we asked, making museum reservations and calling taxis, and recommending excellent low cost restaurants. Florence is a very expensive city, and I searched long and hard before booking the Europa. I felt we got very good value for our $130 Euros.

<Content>a bit disappointed We where staying three nights at the Hotel Europa in Florence.As I wrote the e-mail for booking, the employee Isse was very friendly and accepted even to give us some discount on the room price. This was very appreciated.As we arrived at the hotel later on, we where very disappointed about the room. We reserved a standard double room, but it looked absolutely not like on the picture on their website. Furthermore the room was to the road side and therefore very noisy. Nevertheless, the hotel is located very near the city centre and the dome. And the elevator is small, but very useful.Breakfast we never had, because its only served until 9.30 a.m.so we can not give a feedback on that-The owner Gassim and his daughter (?) Miriam have been very friendly.After the second night, Miriam proposed another room to us, which was to the court side and more quiet.We even got 10 Euro reduction on the price, which was very kind offer from her.Unfortunately in this room you heard all the breakfast noise, because it was beside the breakfast room, beginning at 8 a.m.Alltogether we would say that if you book an expensive room or a suite, hotel Europa can be a good choice. Also the staff is very friendly and we could leave our baggage there on the last day.But if you need a cheap AND quite room, go rather for another hotel.

<Content>2 stars with 5 stars service what more can i say about this place that has not been said already. It felt like a home away from home not just a hotel.The owners make you feel really welcomed and give you a feeling that you have known them for years. The best part of all was the friendlyness of staff which is so hard to find in some hotels. Europa is a must for all travellers.

<Content>Very friendly staff Good location, very helpful with parking the car nearby and the manager / owner is very friendly and helpful. We stayed on the older floor , so the furnishings were not so good , but it was cheaper than most other nearby hotels and over all is perfectly good for a short stay.

<Content>Friendliest experience in Italy! Our family of five (2 adults and 3 children 15, 13,11) stayed for 2 nights in October and loved it! While my husband parked our rental car, I ran ahead up the stairs to book in and was greeted by the lovely, smiling face of Gassim who quickly went to the fridge and handed me an icy bottle of water. My husband brought our daughter in a wheelchair plus our luggage up and was very warmly greeted by Gassim who offered us help in getting us into our gorgeous suite. It was two huuuuge rooms plus a bathroom, so cool and relaxing and not to mention spotlessly clean.While we were marvelling at the space and settling in, there was a knock at our door and there was Gassim with a tray of iced juice for all of us! I can honestly say, in our week in Italy, he was the kindest, friendliest person we came into contact with.Our children loved it so much they wanted to cancel our 2 nights planned in Sorrento and stay on in Florence!The hotel is, indeed in a very ordinary, nondescript building on the 1st and 2nd floor so if you aren't prewarned you could really miss it. Luckily I had read all my Tripadvisor info so was armed with good, useful information!.The breakfast was enough to start the day with and Gassim was always on hand to get you anything you requested, nothing was ever a problem.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone... I haven't seen the rooms but the suite was just beautiful and, as mentioned, the service was so warm and spot on. As I wrote in their guest book.... I just wanted to put Gassim in my pocket and take him home.I hope you read this Gassim! Regards from Lucia and family from Mooloolaba, Australia

<Content>The Staff are outstanding! We were part of a wedding party in Sept and stayed in the Europa for a week. I can't say enough about the support from all the staff to assist us in managing all the special requirements involved in managing a wedding. At the end of our stay, we felt more like part of a family than merely staying at a hotel. The hotel is family run and it shows in the personal consideration shown to all the 'quests'. Whenever I am back in Florence, this would be my stay of choice. As for the 'bells of the Duomo' bothering anyone, how lovely to wake up on the morning of my daughter's wedding and be greeting with such a sound.

<Content>loved the staff and location. As all the previous reviews the staff are very friendly and the location is great but I would recommend you book a suite. We moved from a room to a suite and were informed that all the rooms would be up-rated to the same level as the suites for next it should be great then. You can pay a lot more money for this type of location in Florence.Don鈥檛 be put of by the entrance like a lot of hotels in old buildings the Europe has a shared entrance.

<Content>A Good Choice We stayed 3 nites at Hotel Europa. It is very well-located, nicely appointed, with a friendly, attentive, helpful staff. Our room (called a suite but really just a bedroom and bath) was very clean, reasonable in size. Museum reservations were made for us with no service cost. We would stay there again.

<Content>Felt at home We can highly recommend Hotel Europa, Via Cavour 14, Florence. We spent 3 nights at this hotel at the beginning of our trip. We had a 鈥渟uite鈥?which looked out on a quiet courtyard and the Duomo for 150euros. The room was spacious and attractive with a large comfortable bed and was equipped with an air conditioner, TV, and a safe. Friends also had an equally large and appealing room. The bathrooms were clean and more than adequate and were equipped with a hair dryer. At the end of our trip we again stayed at the Hotel Europa for an additional night. This time our room was a little smaller but very comfortable and quiet (it was also 10euros less). We did not see the regular rooms as we had decided from reading Trip Advisor before booking that the 鈥渟uites鈥?might be worth the extra expense. We were all delighted with the hotel. It is family run. Gassim and his daughter, Miriam, and the family were very warm and helpful which made the stay so pleasant. They are also fluent in English. We were happy to return there for the final night of our trip. The location is excellent. The hotel is only one and a half blocks to the Duomo. This central location made it possible to walk to all the main sites. Don鈥檛 be fooled by the entrance to the building. There is a small elevator which will take you up two floors to the lobby of the hotel. The suites are just up one flight so we used the stairs once our luggage was up. Breakfast is included and consists of cereals, yogurt, fruit, hard boiled eggs, and croissants. Especially good is the large coffee machine which makes everything: expresso, latte, capuchino, americano etc.. We booked directly with the hotel via email. Communication was easy and replies were prompt. When we return to Florence we will definitely stay again at the Europa. A great find!

<Content>We don`t usually do 2 star... We don`t usually do 2 star hotels but the extortinate prices of most things in florence made it a bit of a necessity. I rely a lot on the reviews from trip Advisor when making a hotel choice and so far I have not been let down. We booked this hotel based the previous positive reviews. The Europa is in a good location for most of the sights. We booked a suite which was a good size with nice furniture. The room was clean but dark due to having only one window facing in to a small courtyard, the plus side was that it was very quiet with no street noise, that is apart from the building work which started one morning at 06.30. To be fair we were out most of the day so it was`nt a problem. The room had air conditioning and a safe ( no Charge ! )The breakfast was very basic but enough to start off the day. There is a coffe machine but 4 out of the 5 days my Capaccino was luke warm. The staff were friendly and helpfull. There was nothing about the hotel which dissapointed me and I would reccomend it to anyone who would not usually do 2 star.

<Content>Great hotel, lovely position. Excellent hotel, great position. Although close to the Duomo, the bells were not a problem during the night as they don't start until 7:00am. Our hosts were superb and couldn't do enought to help. Lovely room, large and very quiet. Coffee was excellent, breakfast was okay.Would reccommend this hotel for 3/4 nights in Florence.

<Content>Location was great and Hospitality was Phenomenal! We stayed in Florence in September, and this was our first stop in Italy so we were quite jet lagged upon arrival. We received a terrific recommendation for dinner, and were given a very quiet room. Florence is a busy town and the hotel is located in a busy area with traffic. However, once you step into the hotel you no longer hear the traffic. That is amazing. So we had a solidly quiet and relaxing haven to return to. And our room was immune to the traffic noise. The hospitality is amazing. Miriam, Anton, Miriam's father and mother made all the difference in us enjoying Florence. Such outstanding and warm hospitality; our every question was answered (with patience I might add!) and every need/request met. ). Our stay with Miriam and family is what made Florence even more enjoyable.Location is good - just a few minutes walking from the Academia. Our room could have used a bit of sprucing up. Miriam relayed to me that the hotel would be undergoing a renovation at the end of the year. Any lacking in the decor of our room was overcome by the warmth of our innkeepers.When we return to Florence we will definitely stay at the Hotel Europa again! Also good value for the money!

<Content>Warm welcome in the heart of Firenze! We chose this based on previous Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed. The wonderfully friendly owner greeted us on arrival (hotel is on the second floor) and showed us to a suite, despite us only booking (and paying for!) a regular room. It was enormous and well decorated in Italian style. We had great wooden shutters to ensure a good night's sleep and the biggest shower I've ever seen! Breakfast was nice and again the owner welcomed us by name each morning and helped fellow guests. And the location? Amazing! 200 metres from the Duomo, then straight down to the Uffizi and river beyond. Despite this centrality, we found it a lovely quiet hotel. Go there!

<Content>Hotel Europa is a Gem Our family of five stayed at the Hotel Europa for 3 nights in late August.. We were in the family suite which was on the first floor off a lovely sitting room. There was an extremely large room with 3 beds, a large bedroom with a double bed, and a very new bathroom. The ceilings were very high with beautiful, old fresco paintings on them. The furnishings were lovely. The only complaint was that the street noise in the morning was noticable from this front facing suite even though there were double windows. The a/c worked very well. The owner Gassim was extremely friendly and helpful and really fussed over his guests. He and his family put out a very nice breakfast with a great espresso machine for all to use. Everything was clean and the internet free! The location was very convenient to walking everywhere in Florence - one exception was a bus up to Piazza Michaelangelo for fantastic views over Florence. The reservation they made for us for the Uffizi was a godsend - avoided a 2 hour lineup! We loved this small, friendly hotel and would stay again. It really made our stay in Florence perfect!

<Content>Clean, Quiet, Comfortable, Great Location! We stayed at the Hotel Europa for 4 nights while on vacation in Italy. Upon arrival, we were pretty tired from the walk from the train station to the hotel lugging our bags and Gassim greeted us with a large very cold bottle of water which we really needed. We stayed in the Rafaello room, number 35 and the hotel was well kept and the room was large and clean. Our room overlooked a courtyard and we could see the very top of the Duomo from our 2 windows. I am a very light sleeper and even though we were in the middle of the city, the room was SO quiet. The location is only 1 block from the Duomo and everything is within walking distance, no subway or taxi needed. We rented a car for 2 days and Gassim helped us by calling someone to pick up the car and parking it for us overnight. Gassim works tirelessly and is extremely helpful. He is always available for directions or restaurant recommendations. Miriam is also very helpful. She made our museum reservations prior to arrival which allowed us to bypass all lines at the Accademia and Uffizi. It is also very nice to have the free Internet service which enabled us to talk to our families over e-mail after being gone for a week. We celebrated my birthday and our wedding anniversary in Florence and the day of our anniversary, Miriam and Gassim gave us a delicious celebratory bottle of Chianti. We thought this was very generous of them.We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Europa and will recommend this property to anyone else we know who is visiting Florence.

<Content>Great Service! We had a great stay at the Hotel Europa! The staff was super friendly helping us with everything we requested. The hotel was perfectly situated so that we could walk to everything. The room was very clean and the breakfasts were delicious! You get a whole lot for your money here!We did have trouble finding the hotel on the first pass as we walked from the train station. Here's a tip for you: when you get to the correct street, look for a tourist information yellow sign. The hotel is across the street and a couple of doors down on the same block. Look for a brass plaque at eye hight with the hotel name on it! Another tip for your Florence trip: book your Uffizi reservations as soon as possible if you are traveling in peak season. The staff can call for you!

<Content>Great value for money with a smile What a great spot for seeing everything in Florence. We were on a tight budget and this place was excellent value for money, especially compared to other places in Italy for the same rate. The location was perfect. Close to the Station, really close to all the sights. Gazim always greated us with a smile and was very helpful with all enquiries was so friendly (this can be a bit rare in Europe). Our room was No. 47, clean, well layed out, and it had a cute little balcony off our room with a little table and chairs and it was nice and quiet (a real find in Italy) and we had a shower in our room and a safe as well. It was lovely waking up to the bells of the Duomu (which we had a view of from our room). What a great spot. Breakfast was also included and plenty for us.You must go to Michaelangelo's piazza at sunset to see Florence at dusk with a glass of wine in your hand (beautiful). We did a tour that ended with dinner by a Monastry on top of the hill. Had a great night. Also, definately definately, I mean definately book for entry into the Uffitzi museum or stand in the queue for over 2 hours (we are extremely patient people but even this broke us). You can also get to Pisa by train from there, or tour bus. There are also great markets around the corner from the hotel for leather jackets etc.We had a great time in Florence and it was in great part due to Gazim and his lovely hotel. Thank you Gazim, it was one of our best stays in Italy!

<Content>Best Value Hotel in Europe I have Encountered We stayed in July and were surprised to find that:- there were heaps of room for 3 people (sorry not the best photos!)- air conditioning, a safe, a fridge, a large bathroom were all in the room- breakfast was decent- the family run hotel bent over backwards assisting us. Their ability to remember names and details of conversations really made us feel special.I would agree that a SUITE room is definately the way to go from the sounds of other reveiws. We couldn't have been happier, close to everything as well. Our room #32 was right at the end of the hall on level 1 and so quiet, which was an added bonus. The only thing that I would recommend you don't do is go to ZaZa's for dinner. We were recommended to go here but I was a little disappointed. I am a foodie and I love good food, I found the food here not great value and didn't have that real freshly made pasta taste. We ate at much better restaurants than this throughout Florence.

<Content>I loved this place!! My husband and I stayed here for my Birthday. I have to tell you we love this place and highly recommend it. It is walking distance from the train station. We did a day trip to Venice from there. We loved the shopping close by. The people at this hotel treat you like family. The breakfast in the morning is nice and they have free internet access. The rooms are WONDERFUL. We have no complaints. They even wished me a happy birthday that's how much they pay attention to their guests. It's family owned and run - they are a very nice family and give you great advice and tips. I can't wait to go back someday! We highly recommend it - you won't be dissapointed. Yesenia

<Content>Very disappointed We chose Hotel Europe for our 3 nights stay in Florence base on the positive ratings from other reviews here. However, we were pretty disappointed with the hotel room and their services. First, I think it's a two different worlds if you get a suite room on the 2nd floor rather than a regular single/double room on the 3rd. Apparently, we had a double room. The furnishings were pretty old as well as the carpet that we could see the black stains everywhere. The bathroom was so tiny and not equiped well at all. The shower floor wasn't raised up to keep the water in the shower. Afterall, the most upset experience we encountered is the last day in the morning before we check-out. We told the staff we need to go out for some last minutes shopping for about 45 minutes and will come back before 11am which is the check-out time. So, we only left the AC on when leaving the room. Later we came back about 15 minutes before 11, we found out they came to our room and took the batteries out of the TV remote. Also they turned off the AC and removed the AC remote from our room too. This behavior is so rude. we felt that we were being very unwelcomed. I understand it's a family run business but they still need to maintain certain professional services.

<Content>Reasonable accommodations for a family of four My family of four (including 2 teenage girls) stayed at Hotel Europa from July 29-Aug. 2, 2006. We booked a quad suite (got the Leonardo suite). The hotel was very roomy - plenty of space for our family. The bathroom was very modern. I was a little disappointed at first, as I thought I was getting a suite with a view of the duomo. While we got a very comfortable room, it did not have the view I was expecting. Nonetheless, we still had a wonderful stay. The proprietor, Gassim, was very helpful and polite. He helped us find a nice restaurant (Trattoria Za-Za) that had good food at reasonable prices. Both Gassim and Miriam were prompt in responding to my requests for assistance with booking tours, etc. While we did not have the pleasure of meeting Miriam, I am sure she is just as welcoming as Gassim was. We were also impressed with the energy conservation feature that they have - your room key has to be in a slot to get the lights and A/C to work. While it would have been more comfortable to return to an air conditioned room from being outside, I certainly appreciated their efforts to conserve energy - something we could all do more of.We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location and friendly staff What the Hotel Europa鈥檚 standard room lacked in space, it more than made up for in kind and charming staff. The location was also ideal, situated on Via Cavour only blocks from the Duomo and the Accademia. All the sites were easily visited on foot. The room, indeed, was small and there was some street noise on Saturday night, but we got an excellent rate which included breakfast buffet and AC. Breakfast included cereals, croissants with a variety of spreads (who knew Nutella came in handy little packets?), hardboiled eggs and use of the deluxe coffee maker which provided coffee/cappuccino/espresso/etc. The reception area had a computer with free Internet access for guests, as well as access to a variety of guide books. I would not recommend the standard room for a long stay as it was a bit small, but the Hotel also has suites at a reasonable rate. The standard is a great value for a few days, however, and I would recommend the hotel to travelers on a budget.

<Content>Loved Hotel Europa Staying at Hotel Europa was like staying with relatives. Gassim welcomed us with a cold bottle of water and showed us our room.The room was large and simply yet tastefully decorated with a double bed, sidetables, dressing table, and wardrobe. There was also a TV, electronic safe and the air conditioning was excellent. Prior to our stay, I had questions and also requested for help with reservations at the Accademia and Uffizi Museums, the hotel was always prompt with responses and also made our reservations with no problems at all.Our room also had our own private balcony (10 euros extra), with a view of the Duomo, the courtyard below, and of the neighourhood. This was really lovely as we could enjoy a glass of wine after an afternoon of sightseeing and museums.The hotel was quiet and service was excellent. Gassim was always more than happy to help with any request or questions we had and without asking, he also gave us a map and marked out major attractions when we arrived.Buffet breakfast in the dining room was lovely and included cereals, croissants, breads, jams and spreads, yoghurt, boiled eggs, juice, water and also a cappucino or latte if you fancy. Gassim once again was always there to welcome you and help with anything you needed.Upon check out, we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel with no problems at all as our train out of Florence was leaving later in the afternoon. When we returned, Gassim also eagerly showed us around the rest of the hotel including some beautiful suites perfect for families or for those wanting a lot more room. One even had a 300 year old fresco on the ceiling and some beautiful sculptures!It's true that the hotel is not the Ritz, and it's by all means not a new hotel, however it is family run and has been by the same family for 30 years and is extremely well-kept and maintained. You will never receive service as warm, friendly or as genuine as this in any of the 5 star hotels. Thank you Gassim for all your help and for making our stay in Florence and at Hotel Europa such a wonderful and enjoyable one. Ciao!

<Content>Can't believe it's a 2-star! We took a triple suite room (the difference was EUR30/night to the standard one). We were very pleased with the room, it was big and beautifully decorated. The room was very clean and air conditioned. We had a modern shower bathroom -- however no shower cap was provided, making it a bit difficult to avoid getting the hair wet. Gassim and the other staffs were always very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was standard (toast, croissant, corn flakes, yogurt, etc.). An automatic coffee machine was provided, giving you several choices from espresso to cafe au lait. The location is superb. Within walking distance to train station and all major attractions! We really had a great stay there... Thank you, Gassim!

<Content>Hotel Europa is a Keeper Our family of 7 has just completed a 3 week trip in Italy/France.Hotel Europa in Florence on Via Cavour was our second stop.What a great find this hotel is.The location is great, the owner and his son really care about what they do. They welcome you with a glass of ICE WATER!A luxury in Europe, and priceless in 100+ degree heat.Allow you to refresh yourself before checking in! Offered us his cell phone to call the Bank and the Cell phone company when my daughter's purse was snatched. There are two floors, the lesser expensive are on one floor with big rooms and simple furniture. The more elaborate rooms are also big with antique furniture and beautiful bedding. Whether you stay in the expensive or not, you have a fresh continental breakfast in the dining room with an old but beautiful fresco on the ceiling.He also makes internet access available till 10pm on a computer by the front desk.It is a really comfortable place to stay at thanks to the ownersservice oriented attitude. It was a pleasure.

<Content>Great choice for Florence We (six women ages 13-70) just returned from a stay in Europe and found ourselves at Hotel Europa, Florence during a terrible heatwave. Upon arriving at the hotel, after walking from the train station (on the advice of our travel agent) Gasseim, the owner, met us and took us directly to our rooms so we could cool down before we checked in. He even brought us large bottles of cold water!! We had a quad and double and both had plenty of room. The younger girls were ecstatic to have free internet access(after the 2 euros for 15 min. at other hotels). Breakfast was adequate. The location, perfect. Everything in walking distance. Friendly, personal Gasseim puts this hotel in the above average category.

<Content>Very Happy With The Europa My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Europe for 4 nights at the end of July. We were very pleased with the excellent service we received. Our room was a good size and the bathroom was very well appointed with shower stall, sink, toilet and bidet. There were plenty of fresh towels daily, the bed was large and comfortable and extra pillows were available when requested.The airconditioning worked well even in the extreme heat of July. Breakfast was plentiful but ordinary. The location of the hotel was ideal.My only concern was regarding the mini fridge which shut off when the room key that controlled the electricty to the room had to be taken out when you left the room. This meant that the fridge would not run during the day and so did not keep anything cold while you were out.

<Content>Location, Location, Location! My fiancee and I stayed here in March during our first trip to Italy. The location of Hotel Europa is fantastic...walking distance to many sights. The staff was all very warm, friendly and helpful. The decor wasn't the best but you are not in Italy to sit in your hotel room. The breakfast in the morning was good and so were the cappucinos.

<Content>not worth it!!! We had this hotel booked for several evenings. After the first night, we asked the owners to take a look at the A/C, but nothing was done. Breakfast was OK, but not great except the coffee made for us by the owner. Rooms were quite large, but beds were very uncomfortable. Bathrooms was small even by Florence standards. Owner did give good recommendation for dinner, ZA ZA.

<Content>Not recommended My husband and I just came back from the vacation in Italy for a couple days. we stayed in 5 different hotels in 4 cities for our trip. However, Hotel Europa was the worst one we found. We had 4 nights in Florence. We stayed the first night in a 3 stars hotel: Hotel Caravaggio for 83 Euro per night which is cheaper than Hotel Europa. And we were pretty satisify with Hotel Caravaggio according to their services, environment and facilities. Unfortunately, they were fully booked except the only night we stayed was available. So, we chose Hotel Europa for the rest of the nights in Florence. We were pretty disappointed with the first impression when arriving to this 2 stars hotel. It's an old hotel with an unpleasant interior settings. Although the double room we had is kind of big comparing with the usual hotel rooms in Italy but definitely excluding the bath room. It's very small and they only had the sliding door to seperate the shower and the toilet. The water was spreading out to the whole bath room and we found it so uncomfortable to come back in and use the toilet after showering. After all, the only thing we like about this hotel is their location. It's only 5 minutes walk to Accademia Museum. Anyway, we won't come back to this hotel next time for sure.

<Content>Worthy of prior high ratings Stayed here based on previous high ratings. On vacation with two teen-age daughters.Excellent hotel, super value for the price. Good location, within walking distance of train station, centrally located. Good breakfast. Nice room, very nice shower and bathroom. Air conditioning better than average, but not up to the standard of everything else.Family owned and operated. Very nice owners, helpful and full of suggestions on places to visit and places to eat. Restaurant recommendations very good.Would fully recommend this hotel to anyone, not the Ritz-Carlton but clean, safe, very nice, great value.Chose this hotel based on prior ratings. High rating is well deserved---

<Content>A Little Above Average Given the recommendation for this Hotel by a Friend - Great Location. Staff was friendly and helpful. Free internet by the front desk with a slow computer. Breakfast was not very good. Rooms were very big which was great but the A/C was not as efficient as other places - because the rooms were so big.

<Content>A wonderful choice We selected the Hotel Europa based on positive reviews on this website, and were not disappointed. Gassim and Miriam were extremely gracious hosts who were at all times friendly and helpful. The location is great -- a short distance from the train station, and an easy walk to everything we wanted to see and do. We were traveling with our two teenage boys, and had reserved a quad room, but were pleasantly surprised upon arrival with two double rooms at the same price. The rooms were clean, spacious by European standards, and (thankfully) air-conditioned. I highly recommend Trattoria Za Za, a five-minute stroll away, for a reasonably priced, delicious dinner. Enjoy Florence!

<Content>Liked Hotel Europa For the price, location and service, Hotel Europa can't be beat. My husband and I stayed at Hotel Europa for 3 nights this week and I agreedwith all of the positive reviews. We stayed in the spacious Dante suite. The bedroom and bathroom were attractively furnished, clean and in good condition. The air conditioning was adequate. The owners were very helpful in recommending restaurants and mapping out how to get to the pharmacy, grocery store, etc. The breakfast is not a lavish spread, but we found the cappucinos, yogurt and cereal enough to fill us up and keep us going until lunchtime. We were very happy with our stay and would stay there again in the future. All that being said, I will reiterate what another guest posted - this is a budget hotel. This is not necessarily a bad thing. To stay at more upscale hotels in other cities, we decided to scale back in Florence. Hotel Europa met this need. If you are expecting the Ritz or Four Seasons, you will not be happy here. If you're looking for a clean, quiet place with a great location, this is your place.

<Content>Just loved it! We have just returned from Italy, and spent 5 days in Florence in this hotel. It was so pleasant stay. Miriam is the nicest person in the world. She actually made the reservations for us to Academia and Uffizi. Her restaurant suggestions were excellent. The location of the hotel is just perfect: few blocks from Academia, 5 min walk to the Dome, and maybe 20 min to Uffizi. Plus, if you rent a car 鈥?it is very easy way in/out the city. The room was large, and the bathroom was decent side as well, the mattress was very comfortable. I actually like the breakfast: coffee, cappuccino, eggs, ham, cheese, yogurt, etc. Almost forgot - we had a room with the small balcony. I鈥檒l definitely return to this hotel. THANKs Miriam.

<Content>Home away from home I would recommend anyone visiting Florence to stay at Hotel Europa. The hotel is ideally located near to all the main tourist attractions. Gassim and Miriam are the friendliest and most helpful hosts you could wish for. Traffic noise in Florence never seems to die down, as I found out on the first night when I stayed in a single room facing Via Cavour. I had however been able to book a double room for the second and third night of my stay and this room looked out onto a quiet courtyard. The only sound I heard was the tweeting of the swallows. For an extra 10 euros the double room is definitely a bargain. The room was very spacious with a comfortable bed. Breakfast is conveniently served from 7.30 am till 10.30am and I discovered that the best time to see Florence is between 6am and 9am, before all the tour buses arrive. I was therefore able to go and explore Florence and enjoy the peace and tranquility before returning for some breakfast by mid morning. I hope to return to Florence someday and spend more time visiting this magnificent city. If I do I will certainly book my accommodation at Hotel Europa.

<Content>A Budget Choice The proprietors of this small hotel are such lovely people that it seems almost churlish of me to say anything negative about their establishment. But I think prospective visitors should understand that this is a budget hotel. Our room, while spacious and clean, was not paticularly comfortable or attractive. And the breakfast was just plain not good. Luke warm coffee from a machine and rubbery croissants and rolls. My partner and I agreed that if we had been willing to spend more, we would have stayed elsewhere. So this really was a budget choice. And we further agreed that the next time we go to Florence, we will stay fewer days and at a more upscale place. So just be aware that, despite all the glowing reviews, this is not the Ritz. It is a place to save your euros for other extravagences.

<Content>Good location and value, friendly servce The Europa is a nice hotel for the price, and Gassim, the hotel-keeper, was very friendly. The room we had was a comfortable size with space to open our luggages, and the window opened out onto a lovely view of a garden and neighboring houses. On the other hand, the decore of the room was dated. There were paint chips on the wall and a few squashed bodies of insects long dead. Still, the air condition worked well and the bed was hard and comfortable.The biggest complain I had was that the shower was the kind that is just a faucet and spout off the wall of the bathroom. Basically, you flooded the floor of the bathroom everytime you took a shower. It drains very quickly, but still, you get everthing wet. Plus, the room for showering within the shower curtain is very small. People that are average size or bigger would definitely brush up against the shower curtain. Overall, the Europa was a great value for the money, and it was nice to be greeted by a friendly face as Gassim. The location was the best part, as it was only a short walk from the Duomo and other sights. Florence is such a beautiful city and it's great to be able to walk everywhere.

<Content>Perfection Wow, what a beautiful hotel. Not only the rooms but the bathrooms were spacious. Everthing was immaculately clean. With 9 people, we occupied 4 rooms -- all were very quiet. The hotel is in a building that was formerly a convent with gorgeous, high ceilings. Perfect location -- convenient walking distance to all tourist sites and great restaurants. Gassim and Miriam were so helpful in making museum/restaurant reservations and pointing us in the right direction. The breakfast room was bright and welcoming with a nice selection of food. If we return to Florence, we will choose Hotel Europa again.

<Content>Fabulous Family run hotel! Our trip to Florence was greatly enhanced by staying at the Hotel Europa. The family that runs the hotel is warm and welcoming and helpful. They were accepting and friendly with our children ages 10 and 12. It felt like coming home every night! The suite rooms are worth the extra money. They are beautiful. We stayed in a standard room which is basic but had such charm with the shuttered window that opened out to the Duomo. The location is ideal to walk any where in Florence. We will most definitely be returning!

<Content>Great hotel, best service we had anywhere We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 teenagers). We stayed 2 nights at the end of June 2006 in the Quad Suite room at the front of the hotel. The service is outstanding. We were warmly greeted by name with glasses of juice and shown to our beautiful suite. Our very clean, comfortable rooms had beautiful 15 ft high painted ceilings, large bathroom, good air conditioning. Miriam made advance bookings for us at our request for Accademia and Uffizi to avoid the lines, and we had quick replies to all emailed questions. Breakfast was good with coffee and food served buffet style.We were at the front of the hotel and despite the triple paned windows I woke up a couple of times due to noise, but I was the only one out of four. Parking is tricky, basically you pull over as best you can and send someone dashing into the hotel. They call the parking service (which arrives very quickly), you unload and they park. Worth the 20 euros per day for the doorfront parking service (and worth it not to deal with finding a spot in the wild Florence traffic). The beds for our teens (both over 6') were small but comfortable enough so they slept well. Basically the kids had very good twin size foldaways with extra padding to make more comfortable, with good bedding. (These are folding furniture, NOT the cheap rolling foldaways). The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable, and the furnishings just beautiful.Overall outstanding, I'd definitely stay here again and recommend highly.

<Content>Friendly and Charming Spent three days in Florence at the Europa with my partner and loved every minute of it. The double room was clean, comfortable and quiet with excellent location. Most important of all was the friendly, helpful staff who were always ready to give advice and assistance. On their recommendation, we spent an unforgettable half-day in Tuscany. Will certainly recommend.

<Content>You just don't get service like this any more I stayed at the Hotel Europa after another site failed to honour my booking (should have used TripAdvisor). The family run hotel was so helpful and friendly, it just gave my partner and me a great feeling about our stay. The hotel is right in the centre of the action, yet very quite. Rates are very competitive. Haven't enjoyed a hotel like it in a long time. Thoroughly recommend.

<Content>Great Location Just returned from a week in Florence at The Hotel Europa - chosen as a result of the earlier reports on this website and we were not disappointed. The location is superb, 5 mins from the Duomo and the main Station, and although it's on the busy Via Cavour, most of the rooms are to the rear so noise is not a problem.Our room was very clean, bright and air-conditioned with a view of the Dome. The family that run this hotel are very friendly and helpful and will do anything to make your stay enjoyable.The one 'moan' I have is that the choice at breakfast was somewhat limited. I enjoy continental breakfasts but would have liked a little more choice of meats and cheeses than what was on offer. Needless to say this is just a minor point and did not spoil our holiday in any way.

<Content>A Warm Welcome in Florence Hotel Europa, Via Cavour, Florence is a friendly, family run hotel within a few minutes walk of the Duomo. It could not be better located. While plain, the rooms are spotless and roomy, with compact bathroom and air conditioning (an ESSENTIAL in Florence). Its chief attraction is the family who run it. They anticipate their guests every need and no request is a hassle for them, even when they are busy. They are fluent English-speakers and know the city inside and out. We will be back.l

<Content>Great for the price We booked here based on all of the great reviews, and were not disappointed. The hotel is in a great location, and the staff were incredibly nice. Our room was also very quiet. For the price I don't think the place can be beat. We were somewhat disappointed with the bathroom, which was tiny and had a rather ineffective shower door and drain, leading to a pretty wet bathroom. We didn't actually try the breakfast because we slept too late every morning, but our friends staying there at the same time said that it was not very good. Fortunately there is an outstanding cafe just a couple of doors down, with some of the best coffee we had in Florence. Overall we would recommend Hotel Europa as a great value for the price, but don't expect anything too fancy.

<Content>The most wonderful hotel I've ever stayed in We booked this hotel because of its great reviews on Trip Advisor and all of the excellent reviews were true. Our family (2 adults, 1 child) stayed in the Europa hotel for 3 nights from June 12th-June 15th. We had a triple standard room for 160 EUR a night with breakfast included. This was our favorite hotel out of the 4 great hotels we stayed in during our trip. The room and bathroom was huge, the breakfast was excellent, and we didn't hear any noise from outside. All the hotels we stayed in had excellent staff but the service level at this hotel was exceptional. I requested some information about a tour soon after making my hotel reservation. They contacted the tour operator and e-mailed me the information weeks before we arrived. While there, I requested that they confirm my booking for this tour and they did that as well. They were also the only hotel with a reasonably priced laundry service. Two huge loads cost us less than 25 EUR. We dropped it off in the lobby in the morning and it was done and in our room by 6:00pm that night. If I ever return to Florence, I wouldn't stay anywhere else except at this hotel.

<Content>What a Haven Of 3 different hotels I stayed at in the last week traveling around Italy, Hotel Eruopa in Florence was my favorite. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and quiet. There was a generous selection at breakfast, and the staff was so hospitable. None of this should have been as surprise given my first impression of the hotel: timely response to my reservation request. I recommend the hotel without qualification.

<Content>Great Florence hotel for family Our family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids 17 to 23) had a great 5 days at Hotel Europa. We had a 2 bedroom/1 bath suite for about 鈧?30 a night. The bathroom situation was a bit tight, but it was worth it for the $ we saved. We also had a large livingroom area right outside our doors that was basically all ours. Walking distance to Duomo, train, Accademia, all other sights. We never took a bus. Our rooms faced a busy street (we had just been in Venice, so the traffic noise was a bit of a shock!), but many of the other rooms faced interior courtyard. Breakfast was pretty standard European--breads, cheese, ham, cereal, cappucino. Very friendly and helpful owners.

<Content>Great hospitality My wife and I spent several nights at the Hotel Europa in June 2006. Spendid hospitality provided by Gassim and Miriam. Great location just a block from the Duomo, the rooms are large, quiet and clean. My first choice on my return visits to Florence.

<Content>Perfect place to stay in a perfect town My wife and I stayed in Hotel Europa for a week at the end of May 2006. The hotel was perfect.Location - The hotel is one and a half blocks north of the Duomo, easy walking distance to anything we wanted to see in the downtown area. If you want to see the sites up on the hill south of the river, you may need to take a cab.Hospitality - We truly felt like Gassuin, Miriam, and the rest of the staff would gladly do anything to make our stay enjoyable. They spent time before we arrived helping us plan our visit, made reservations at museums for us, recommended wonderful restaurants and activities, made sure the taxi to the train station was on time, etc.Rooms - We stayed in the Dante Suite. It was extremely quiet (and pitch black dark when we closed the shutters and shade - great for sleeping in or taking a mid-afternoon nap). Our suite was extremely clean and well maintained.Breakfast - Unlike some of the other reviewers, we thought the breakfasts were not lacking at all. The staff provided coffee, juices, milk, rolls, ham, cheese, cereal, yogurt, fruit, etc.Overall - We highly recommend staying at the Hotel Europa. If we are blessed enough to return to Firenze, we will stay there again without thinking about it twice.

<Content>2 Star Ask The Right Questions First the good news. Location is great, close to the Duomo and Accademia and some great restaurants. The owners are gracious and accommodating. Now the real news. From an American's perspective this is a solid 2 star hotel. Only rooms on the 2nd floor look like the web photos. The lobby is on the 3rd floor and the entrance via the street, a corridor serving other offices and apartments, requires one to travel on the world's smallest perhaps oldest elevator, 1 person, 1 piece of luggage per lap. The price is right but there are no frills, expect basic and very clean accommodations. A PC sits next to the check-in desk where one can access the internet. Watch for rooms facing the street. The owners recommended a superb restaurant right around the block. If all you need is a reasonable place to sleep, then this is not a bad choice. Buona Fortuna!

<Content>Brilliantly Hospitable My wife and I spent 3 terrific days at the Europa over her birthday weekend in June. If you're in a hurry to get to the next review, just know that we were delighted with everything about our stay, otherwise.... Hotel (general)- Small and easy to miss. It occupies the 2nd two floors of a business/residential building and the sign is small - not an unusual situation in Florence on either count.  Interior is well done and inviting with lots of antique furniture. The second floor (suite floor) is elegant and has a wonderfull, large common lounge area - 14 foot ceilings and tastefully furnished with lots of comfortable furniture - perfect for gatherings of 15 or 20, if you're traveling with a group. The 1st floor is not as elegant, but very comfortable and 'homier' than the second floor - a very easy and pleasant place start and end your day.  The place has the feel of a BB with the privacy of a hotel. Other guests that I spoke with were very happy with their accomodations and seemed genuinely fond of the staff (as were we)Breakfast -  Included in the room price and served in the 1st floor dining room. Breakfast is continental basic, (breads, cerials, yoghurts, boiled eggs, etc;) but just what most folks need to start the day. The coffee is good and plentifull.Room -  We stayed in the Dante Suite. The room was very large, immaculately clean, bright and delightfull. This room is a multi-level affair with lots of large windows (that actually open.) The furnishings were not new (except for the bed), but wonderfully restored and perfect for the setting - a fair bit of successful thought went into the furnishings and decor. The furniture restorations also boasted some excellent artwork on armoire, bed headboard and desk that I'm fairly certain was done by a family member - all in excellent taste and absolutely charming. Floors are a heavy tile - new, and very attractive. The suite rooms do not face the street and the triple pane windows make for cacoon like quiet that's well appreciated after a long day burning shoe leather on the Florence cobblestones. I expect the standard rooms have the same high quality windows and should be equally quiet. Air conditioner was whisper quiet (we couldn't tell it was on at first) and very effective. The bed was a firm king size, and plenty long for me, which is not always the case in Europe - VERY comfortable. Bath - Each suite is a unique 'one off'. Our bath was large,and spotlessly clean. We had a large tub (perfect for soaking) with fully functional shower. The bidet was just close enough to the water closet for my wife to spend qualty time soaking her feet in it while sitting on the stool. I don't know it this was brilliant ergonomic forethoght or a fortunate and unexpected result - but it was perfect.Location - Could not be better. 2 minute walk to market square, 5 minutes to the Domo and square (if you walk slowly), 10 minute walk to the Uffizi, 15 minutes to the Academia, 20 minutes to Boboli Gardens. Parking is expensive if you drive (20 euro/day for a Pugeot 307 - large cars 30 euros), but the hotel works with a garage and will arrange parking for you - the price is as good as you'll find in Florence.Service - Could not possibly be better. Reading all the glowing TripAdvisor reviews, mention after mention was made of the hotel staff's eagerness to help. I was a little concerned that they may be too eager and perhaps intrusive - completely unfounded worry. We found the chief staff members (Gassim, Miriam and Robert) to be extremely warm and genuine, knowledgeable and brilliantly hospitable. I travel a grat deal in my work and have never been treated better anywhere, regardless of star count. This staff is composed of professionals who know exactly how to put you completely at ease.  Side note: When making reservations weeks before our arrival, I had mentioned that we would be celebrating my wife's birthday in Florence. The staff remembered this distant remark and presented us with a birthday bottle of Chianti during our stay. Would we stay here again? Yes. I plan to return to Florence for no other reason than to enjoy this delightfull hotel and it's extraordinary staff.

<Content>Home away from home We travel often and have never encounted the level of hospitality that we found at the Hotel Europa. Miriam helped us with museum reservations and recommended a tour company for a day trip through the Chianti region (the highlight of our trip) before we even arrived in Florence. Her father Gassim greeted us with an ice cold bottle of water when we arrived at the hotel and gave us a great recommendation for dinner (Zsa Zsa's), which we loved so much, we ate there twice during our 4 night stay. Our room had a nice view of the Duomo, it was very clean, and there was plenty of space for the 2 of us. The bathroom, on the other hand, was very small (even by European standards), and the shower left much to be desired, especially for my husband, who pointed out that you could go to the bathroom, brush your teeth, and take a shower all at the same time. There was a shower head sticking out of the wall and a curtain in the corner of the room, but nothing to keep the water from soaking the entire floor while showering. Breakfast was included, but just ok. The location was great, right near the Duomo, and easy to get to all other major sights in Florence. Overall, a good value for the money and we would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Europa We have just returned from a weeks holiday in Florence - a beautiful city - but the secret hidden there is definitely the hotel Europa.Despite being just minutes from the station/Ponte Vecchio, Piazza Del Signorina, Duomo etc - the hotel was so quiet and we slept well in our elegant and spotlessly clean suites - which had everything we needed.Gassuin  Miriam and their family looked after us well. They were gracious and friendly - nothing was too much trouble for them - from train times to tickets and local info on supermarkets and places to eat THEY made our holiday a memorable experience.Thank you for a wonderful time in your superb hotel.See you again Miriam!?!The Booth Family

<Content>Great value. Lovely staff. Cannot beat the location and friendliness of the staff for that price. (especially in Florence).Don't be decieved by simple looks of the building - the hotel occupies a couple of floors in a residentail building. The lobby and the rooms look nice. Our room was very bright and spacious and even had a bathtub. The breakfast is a bit on a budget side.The hotel is whithin 10min walk from Ufizzi so you're within walking distance from most attractions.If you decide to drive to the hotel, make sure to get a good map and prefferably directions. Driving in Florence is not fun.

<Content>Nice people, wonderful stay!!! If you are looking for present stay in Florence, this is THE hotel. I am spending 60 nights every year at hotel with business and private, still I could evaluate it was one of the most present stay as family running, holiday hotel.We had a stay in 4 nights here with children 9 and 7 years old. Our room was far enough big (may be special room, two rooms with high roof) and confortable with air condition, 2xTV, and refrige. The location is perfect that is near to everywhere, in front of large load but no noise thanks to double window. The breakfast area is like lovely, family dining. On top of that, the presence of very kind owner Gassim and his staff makes this hotel exceptional. They are very kind and helpful, full of mind of supporting you. Anyway, if you are still reading my comment, you rather book this hotel before running it out.One tip for you, if you are looking for olive oil and/or aceto balsamico, try glosary store in front, they offer tasting.

<Content>At the very least, this place should be rated a 3-star hotel This is a really great hotel in a wonderful city! Miriam and Gassim are true pros at this (and the room for the money is not at all a bad deal) - a wonderful welcome for us, which included a personal tour of the room, a city map w/ all the 'hot spots' circled, and water! All the good reviews on this hotel are true. From making museum reservations (make sure you have them do this for you) to recommending restraurants, and down to the free internet service in the lobby and the wonderful breakfast buffet (fresh hardboiled eggs to boot) - this place has it all! Our only complaint is that the shower in our suite was way too small. We will definitely come back to this hotel next time we're in Firenze, and suggest you stay here too!!

<Author>Surprised
<Content>Great location Located between the Duomo and the Accademia, the Europa is an ideal base for exploring Florence's major sights and museums. As others have commented, it's not really a 2-star hotel (as it states), either in terms of its furnishings and facilities or its price (we paid 150 Euros for one of the 'suite' rooms - a double room with large ensuite - on the 1st floor). The welcome and hospitality were delightful, particularly in comparison with some hotels.I do wonder, though, whether the hotel might be resting a bit on its laurels, with these extremely enthusiastic Tripadvisor reviews giving it a very high Florence ranking. For example, the breakfast was not very impressive compared with many similar-priced hotels in Italy and other southern European countries: no fruit (fresh or otherwise), processed cheese slices individually wrapped in plastic - and none of those 'extra' touches - though there was fresh coffee.  Readers of this site should perhaps note that not all the rooms are as wonderful as most of the reviews suggest: 'suite' No. 37 had no balcony and no view (except of the central part of the building and rather noisy air-conditioning outlets); well, we had to keep the windows closed anyway to avoid being attacked by mosquitoes. As a hotel room, however, it was spacious and very nicely furnished 'in Florentine style', as was the wide corridor and the spacious sitting room (complete with ceiling fresco) on the 1st floor. The lack of a normal hotel foyer - just a passage from the street and a tiny lift or fairly uninviting stairs to the 2nd floor reception area - is a bit off-putting initially, but obviously something the hotel cannot do anything about. I'd probably stay at the Europa again, but next time I'd look forward to a delicious breakfast to match the otherwise excellent hospitality!

<Content>Miriam  My 3 friends and I stayed at Hotel Europa for only 2 nights in May this year, and we were sorry to leave! We were a bit nervous when we first arrived to see the lift...but as soon as we met Miriam all our doubts vanished. She showed us to our huge bedroom...the 4 of us were sharing...and then she gave us a map and suggested places to eat, shopping etc. Mr. Gassim even had a bottle of red wine waiting for us in the lounge! The room was very clean, and the bathroom had a large tub with shower! We were in Venice and Rome as well, and had nice rooms, but they did not compare with Hotel Europa. The hospitality we received from Miriam and Mr. Gassim was above and beyond!I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Florence. You will not be dissappointed...this is a true gem!

<Content>Quiet haven Florence must now vie with allcomers for award for the most tourist laden and crowded cities for its size in Europe. The contrast between the seething scenes in the streets, the art galleries, the churches and the scene in the Europa could not be more marked. The small and - for its class in this city - keenly priced hotel is a model of quietness.We stayed in the Europa for two nights. Our principal purpose in returning to Florence was to go to a performance of Falstaff at the Teatro Communale on the other side of town. The Europa is set on two floors (first and second) about two hundred metres from the Duomo. We had two rooms - one vast room on the first floor and a somewhat smaller (although still generously sized) one on the second. Both were quiet and classically furnished and amply met our needs. The proprietor and family were amongst the most welcoming and assiduous that I have ever come across in some forty years of what at times seemsto me like too frequest a use of hotels. If you're looking for a small modest and friendly hotel at the opposite end of the spectrum from the international four star chains, this one is well worth considering. We will certainly use it again if our journeys take us to Florence again.

Warm welcome on our arrival, a complimentary bottle of water was brought to our room which was very much appreciated. Considering it is classed as a 2* hotel, the service and accomodation could easily outdo a 4* hotel.Nothing is too much trouble for the friendly and helpful owners, who went out of their way to make sure we had a enjoyable stay.Highly recommend this hotel; its location is excellent, the service exceptional, and the rooms comfortable and spotlessly clean.We look forward to a return stay.

<Content>Miriam is a gem! Staying at Hotel Europa is like staying with friends. Miriam and her father, Gassim, greet you with warm smiles and a friendly welcome. We stayed in a standard room at Hotel Europa for 2 nights. Miriam had honestly told us when we booked that this was the only room available and it was situated at the front of the hotel, so we were not expecting a suite or a room with a view. The room was small but very clean.Hotel Europa is in a woderful location within walking distance to all the main sights.Miriam and Gassim, made our Florence experience very special, with their warm hospitality and friendly advice. They had happily pre-booked Uffizi and Accademia tickets for us and gave us wonderful recommendations on what to see and do and where to eat. We had dinner at Trattoria Za- Za both nights as the food was excellent and the service delightful.We are looking forward to staying at Hotel Europa when we return to Florence and will recommend it to our friends.Thankyou Miriam and Gassim.

<Content>Hated to Leave! I loved these people - Gassim, Miriam  Robert were wonderful, and I highly recomment spending time with them. Our rooms were spacious  clean, the location was perfect. (Due to flight delays, we arrived after midnight and the hotel was a bit difficult to find in the dark. Since street numbering is not necessarily sequential, we were looking for a neon sign from the street. We walked by it the first time, around the block, and the second time we spotted it. You had to look into the entranceway to see the neon sign.)

<Content>Anniversary visit to Florence My husband and I visited the Hotel Europa for our first wedding anniversary. We had a fantastic time. We had a corner room with a balcony overlooking the Duomo- very romantic!We chose the Europa because my husband had used this hotel for business for nearly 20 years. The owners- Gasim and his daughter Miriam- have become friends. The atmosphere is always welcoming and relaxed and the standard of accomodation and service is always high. The location is so central yet protected from the noise of traffic. We will be returning to Florence regularly for business and we will continue to stay at the Europa. It is an oasis in the centre of this busy town.

<Content>Great service, great location I was in Hotel Europa with my mother for five nights. I chose it based on the tripadvisor reviews and I was very satisfied. My priorities were the location and find a place one can rest at leisure.The hotel was best two star hotel I have been and the most expensive. Yet I think it was really worth of all that.If you are looking for a hotel in Florence and you appreciate a nice, clean, everything working, spacious and silent (we were in garden side) rooms, great, discrete and always helpful service, great location (about 100 meters from Duomo), decent breakfast, etc. and you do not need a disco downstair or a terrace pool you can stop looking. Europa is one of the best and very affordable hotel choice in Florence.I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>The freindliest hotel in Florence! From the perfect location to the spacious comfort of the rooms, this hotel would be hard to beat. It is just blocks away from the Duomo and the mercado (and a Mail Boxes Etc in case you shop too much and need to send things home). Waking up to a breakfast that included a cappuccino was delighful but the best thing about this hotel is the friendly and helpful staff; Miriam, Robert and Gassim - what lovely people! The worst thing about the place was leaving.Tip: For a wonderful, private little balcony ask for room 47...

<Content>Great Place to Stay Just returned after spending 5 nights in the Europa, Miriam and Gassim are wonderful hosts, Rooms are spacious, clean and tidy. Location is excellent. Za Za's is a good place to eat as recommended, vistied it a number of times during our stay. Also found another good Trattoria Zio Gigi in Via F Portinari, off Via Dell Oriuolo just at the back of the Duomo, good food and very reasonably priced with freindly staff

<Content>Perfect location  Stayed one night in Florence at this hotel. Stayed in the quad room with my two children  wife. Room was very large  beds were good. Extremely clean. Nice bathroom with another full bathroom down the hall (shared bathroom,extremely clean). Excellent location to walk anywhere. Owners were so nice and helfull. Robert called a restaurant for me for reservations. A must go to place call IL Latini. Best dining experience in all of Italy over 10 day period. My 14  12 year old had fun. Food was superb. Must be there before 7.30. when doors open. Thanks to every one for a great stay.

<Content>Great place to stay - recommend it! Just returned from 3 nights here, highly recommended. Very central, 2 minutes (if that) walk south to the Duomo, and an easy walk from train station. We stayed in a pleasant, light room on first floor with a view over a central courtyard - main hotel is on the second floor.The staff at the hotel, Miriam and her family, make the stay what it is. They are bright and cheery, and you get the feeling that nothing is too much trouble, from booking Uffizi tickets via email to recommending restaurants and offering tea/coffee when you arrive back at the end of the day. Beds are comfy, breakfast is standard continental, ham, cheese, hard boiled eggs and cereal etc. If you like a good hotel, with great staff and somewhere you feel relaxed, then the Europa is for you - we'd stay there again - thanks, TripAdvisor, for the tip. PS. Walk with Walking Tours, Via Sassetti; climb to San Miniato al Monte /up the tower at Pisa; drink at hole-in-wall wine shop near Orsanmichele; eat at Trattoria 4 Leoni just south of Ponte Vecchio. Enjoy!

<Content>Booked with the Best! On a recent visit (April 1-8, 2006) to Florence to visit my niece who is studying there, my sister, myself and my two nephews stayed at Hotel Europa in Florence, Italy. We stayed in Suite 39 the DiMedici Suite and it was phenomenal. The suite itself is very large. There are two HUGE rooms and a very nice bathroom with an awesome shower. Best of all was Gassim and his daughter Miriam who just could not do enough for you. Breakfast every day was complimentary and it was very abundant and filling. Having the use of the internet to check email was a big plus. I must say that correspondence with Hotel Europa prior to our trip and then booking this hotel was excellent. Gassim and Miriam always answered my emails and ALL my questions. They gave excellent advice on how we should travel from the Pisa airport to the hotel the night we arrived. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Florence. You will not regret it. I will definitely be back. Oh, and this hotel is within walking distance to everything. Thanks Miriam, Gassim, and everyone at Hotel Europa for your kindness and generosity. Sincerely, Rev. William Kelly

<Content>Great stay, friendly staff! We had a great time at the Hotel Europa in early April. The room was spacious and the hotel was well located (right across from the old Medici Palace!!!). Mariam and her family were warm, welcoming, and a great resource for local recommendations. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for simple, clean, and friendly accomodations in Florence!

<Content>Awesome Hotel and Staff We read great things about this hotel and they are all true. We stayed in manyhotels in Europe during April 2006 and this was by far the best. The staff(Miriam) was wonderful. The rooms were amazing. Our room (a quad) washuge with a large bathroom. It had a large window that opened into a smallcourtyard area. We felt at home here. The breakfast was great and they evenhad a computer we could use to send e-mails. I would stay here again. It wasalso just around the corner from the David. Great location, great hotel. Thanksfor everything Miriam.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Europa Beautiful memories from a lovely hotel. Gracious, helpful owners and perfect location. Decor, furnishings and frescos make for a warm and relaxing evening in your room or in the sitting area. Thank you so much for the English guidebooks to review, CNN and Internet access. Our hotel in Rome did not provide any of these conveniences. I have already recommended this hotel and would definitely return.

<Content>THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stayed here for 4 nights and we had 3 rooms.1st - The Dante Suite - wonderful, large with a view of the Duomo. Bathroom was also large with a tub/shower. Perfect!2nd - room right next to dante suite - Triple room and even with 3 of us in the room it was plenty big. Bathroom very large and beds were cozy.3rd - Double room with nice view. Large bathroom. My parents said it was perfect.All rooms were on the second floor and are the suite rooms. All rooms had a refrigerator for drinks and snacks. There is also a large room with tables and chairs on the second floor that we sat in a few nights before dinner and played card and drank wine.Breakfast was just right and the coffee and cappicino was wonderful. There is also a small lift for luggage or tired bodies. Location was perfect. Close to everything. Also free internet that our 13 year old twins used alot. I am saving the best for last. The absolute best of the hotel is the family that run it. Miriam and i emailed countless times before our trip and she was so helpful. She made our reservations to the Accademia and the Uffizi, even changed the times for us when we wanted more time at the Uffizi. When we arrived she told us of a nice grocery store nearby and where to grab a good, fast lunch. She also recommened to eat dinner at Zaa Zaa's. I hate to admit it but we ate there 3 out of 4 nights. Something we never do, we always want to try different places. But it was so GOOD! Miriam's father Gassim made me tired watching him wait on us in the mornings at breakfast. So kind and always made us feel welcome. A true gentleman.On our last night there our 8 year old had a very close call with a taxi that was going too fast. Miriam found out and was so kind to me after seeing this almost happen. She had a similar thing happen to one of her daughters when she was little and it was so nice to talk Mom to Mom. She sent our son a little chocolate treat to cheer him up because he was so upset. We hated to leave at the end of our stay with them. All other accomendations we had in Italy, though good, do not hold a candle to this place. We truly felt we were being welcomed into their home and they would be welcome in ours anytime!

<Content>Hospitality at it's greatest. We stayed at this small hotel on a last minutes notice. We were recommended this hotel from another hotel that we previously stayed at. (We took that as a good sign)This hotel is owned and family managed. We can't stress enough the graciousness and courtesy we were given. Smiles all around and our comfort was an evident priority of theirs.We stayed in a modest clean room and were surprised to see the rooftop of the Duormo from our window.We were also given a tour of a newly remodeled wing that boasted larger rooms that can accomidate large families and or conference rooms. We were quite taken back at the 300 year old breathtaking fresco's on the ceilings.Price and value are exceptional and our room included a yummy breakfast perfect for getting our day started!Thanks again to all the staff for making us feel at home. We shall return!

<Content>Excellent! My wife, 21 month old and I stayed at the Europa for 3 nights in early April and were overwhelmed by how wonderful the hotel staff were. Their recommendations for where to eat were very good. They were very helpful and pointed us in the right direction when we had questiosn. Our room was nicely decorated, much bigger than we expected and was very quiet. The hotel is centrally located and is an easy walk to all major attractions. Should we return to Florence, we will absolutely return to the Europa.

<Content>A very nice place I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in April 2006. We found it very nice, just as described here. Gassim and Miriam were very friendly and helpful; Gassim remembered our first names from the very beginning. Their suggestions on shops and restaurants were very good. We had a suite the first night, and because the suites were full, a regular room the second night. The sleeping quarters were about the same size, and the suite's bathroom was much bigger, with a tub. The regular room, however, had a nice little balcony overlooking a courtyard, with flowers and views of the Duomo and Campanille; add somebody playing some opera in the distance, and it was lovely. The Europa is centrally located, within walking distance of everything. When I go back to Florence, I'd go back to the Europa.

<Content>Gem of a hotel My wife and I stayed here at the start of March; we can confirm everything that has been said about this hotel. If you want a comfortable, relaxing, central base to explore Florence this is a fantastic choice. We stayed in a suite, more a large room, but clean, spacious and excellent value. The location is spot on with the Academia and Domo a minute or twos walk away, also there are a number of excellent restaurants nearby that the staff (they are as friendly and helpful as everyone says) will guide you to. We happily recommend this hotel.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic The Europa certainly lived up to all our good expectations (having seen the reviews on this site). It's close to everything; clean and quiet; and best of all the staff are the friendliest in Florence. We asked them for advice on which restaurants to go to, and each time the advice given was flawless - it really made our stay magical. They also immediately offered to sort out our reservations for the Uffizi and the Accademia, which is just a block away from the hotel - all the reservations were made within 5 minutes.Inside, the hotel itself is beautifully decorated and maintains a peaceful atmosphere. Everything in our room was clean and in working order, and the bed was huge! There were lots of TV channels to choose from on the TV in our room, and free internet access was available at a computer next to reception.For the price, this really is the best and friendliest hotel I've ever been to. I'll certainly be staying there again - it's absolutely fantastic.

<Content>Great for the price Our family of 4 with 2 adult-sized teenagers stayed here for 4 nights. We were initially given a room on the second floor, but were upgraded to a larger room on the first floor when we found that the first room was definitely too small. Agree with all the previous comments about the staff (they even charged our kids' iPods for us!) and location. Keep in mind: 1. ask for a first-floor room, they are definitely nicer and larger, worth the extra few euros, and 2. breakfast is Continental and basic, your growing kids will be hungry in a couple of hours.

<Content>Best location--Incredible staff Stayed in 2 suites with my in-laws for four nights and had a wonderful restful stay. From the first day we were treated very well. Robert thank-you for your help getting everyone settled.The rooms were spacious and quite and charming. The locations is probably the best in Florence with lots of places to grab a quick bite right around the corner any many excellent restaurants close by. The rooms were spotless and clean. The feel of the place was more like a bb or guesthouse rather than a hotel. Never crowded at breakfast. Excellent cappucino machine and breads, rolls, yogurt cereal.My in-laws were very tired the first night and we brought food back to the lounge area and Gassim surprised us with a wonderful bottle of wine on a silver tray. Thank-you for getting our trip off to a great start. Miriam a thank-you for everything you did to make our trip so memorable. I have seen many mentions of the elevator and we found it to be fine. Used it constantly for my in-laws. The steps are easy too! Just one flight up. The best is how kind and helpful everyone is. All the time--Every time. From reservations to maps, even loaned us an adaptor.Looking forward to coming back as soon as we can!

<Content>Great Value for money, extremely friendly staff Hotel Europa is a two star hotel, but don't let that deter you. I stayed on the suite floor, that has virturally silent rooms (you can only hear birds in the morning), and the whole room is decorated in the same hues, including the hand-painted closet, headboard of the bed, and desk. The room itself was quite spacious as was the bathroom, and very very clean. The staff was very friendly (and will make an effort to greet you in your mother tongue) and made reservations for us at the museum, and circled points of interest on a map, including helpful tips like the nearby supermarket. Breakfast was very good, and plentiful. I would surely recommend this hotel and will return to stay there in the hopefully near future. Neta, Israel

<Content>A best bet for an inexpensive place to rest your head. ** are you going on your first european holiday and hear that their hotels are TINY and expensive ?... well, the Europa is for you **.Being a 2 star hotel,we were not expecting very much. we were just looking for a comfortable place for 3 people. Knowing that european hotel rooms are miniscule unless you mortgage your house, we were not expecting very much.we decided to take the larger sized room and expected only an average sized american type room. to our surprise, the room was very spacious and well appointed for a 2 star. While the ammenities are on par with 2 star hotels, there were some 3 star attributes like the large size of the main room with a huge bed and a quite large bed for our teenager. As well, the breakfast (the usual croisant and cereal fare) was free including a never ending supply of superb cappucino coffees. Internet is also free as long as you supply your passport number for the police to make sure you are not planning the next 9/11. Also pushing the rating up was a huge bathroom with a towel warmer which we also used to warm up our pj's before retiring. The only thing missing was a table or something to put all of our toiletries. funny how hotels give you enough space for 1 toothbrush and a few other things.the hotel is located well and many adventures are within walking distance. What pushed the quality to a 5 star hotel was the staff, expecially the owner Gassim and his wife and daughter. Extremely friendly and willing to do anything to make our stay friendly. They treated us like family. You can't put a price on that. Maybe i'll buy a room and retire there.You won't be disappointed.

<Content>Wonderful hotel Great hotel. People who own/run place are incredably nice and accomodating. Rooms are roomy by European standards, though a bit sparse in terms of furnishing. Breakfast included, Continental style. If you stay here, which I would certainly recommend, take a taxi to it the first time, or you'll spend a bit of time looking for it, because it encompasses a few floors in a building with other things and the sign is easy to miss. Overall, great hotel

<Content>Great Service, good Value  I picked this hotel based on previous reviews and was not disappointed (once I got past the bldg entrance). As posted in previous reviews the building entrance where the hotel is located may initially throw you off but the rooms are very nice. The hotel is located on the 2nd  3rd floors of a larger building but you have the option of utilizing the 2 person elevator versus the stairs.My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights in a suite room on the 2nd floor with an interior courtyard view. I would recommend a 2nd floor suite room location for the decor  quiet.The location is excellant for walking around the city center. Excellant staff hospitality to assist with all your needs. Upon our arrival the front desk person (can't recall her name) gave us a map and highlighted points of interest, shopping(my personal favorite)  made some restaurant recommendations for lunch  dinner. The breakfast was avg. Just enough to get you going. I would definately recommend this hotel because of the cleanliness, service, location, value  would stay again.

<Content>Great Location We really enjoyed our stay at this good value hotel, we stayed up stairs in the 'rooms' section. Our room looked as if it had once been part of a grand house with a fresco still visable on the ceiling. the bathroom was a little small, but for the price we paid, the location was stunning! Best of all was the glimps of the Duomo from the bedroom window, and hearing the bells ring twice a day, (only 5 minutes at a time though)breakfast was fine, i would have lost the giant TV screen though!

I wish every hotel was like Hotel Europa in Florence. The customer service is amazing! The location is great! The rooms are spacious! The rooms were very clean! Florence was the highlight of our trip and Hotel Europa was a big reason. We can't wait to go back!

<Content>Wonderful Find in Florence Truly a wonderful hotel in Florence. We stayed in the Dante Suite and couldn't be happier. Gassim  his daughter took great care of us and made sure we found our way around Florence - they both speak perfect English as well, so no worries there. There was a standard breakfast every morning starting at 7:30pm with cereal, fruit, coffee, etc. The location was terrific...a few mins walk to the Duomo and only about 10 mins to the Uffizi  Ponte Vecchio. We'd definitely stay again if we return to Florence.

<Content>Pleasant Surprise What a great stay. We reserved a quad room for my wife and I plus our two children. It was by far the biggest room we stayed in on our trip. Everything was clean, the staff was polite and helpful, and the breakfast was more than adequate. I wouldn't hesitate recommending this fairly priced, conveniently located hotel to anyone. P.S. The kids loved the old fashioned lift!

<Content>Wonderful welcoming hotel - Highly recommended My family of 5 (three teenage daughters) spent two days at the Europa over the new year. Gassim, Miriam and all the staff provided us with a wonderful time. The rooms provided were clean and spacious with a newly renovated bathroom. They organisd the parking and garaging of our car without a hassle. Breakfast provided was of good quality and plentiful. Location cannot be faulted with the Duomo just a couple of minutes away. But it is the warmth of the welcome when you arrive and the cheerfulness in dealing with any request or question which we found to be the most endearing quality of our stay. Highly recommended especially for families.

<Content>All I can say is "WOW" From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like family. Gassim the owner had remembered me emailing him and set aside the best room in the house for me. I believe it was room 47 or 27 and it was the one with a balcony (the only one with a balcony on the floor) with plants and flowers and a cafe table overlooking the Duomo. Gassim always remembered my name and was the last one to bed and first one to get up around the hotel. He has really put his heart and soul into the place. And it is very centrally located. It's 2 or 3 blocks to the Accedmia. And a straight shot down to the Uffizi. This hotel is highly recommended.

<Content>Terrific stay at the Hotel Europa In October of 2005, my husband and I took our delayed honeymoon traveling through different cities in Italy. In Florence, it was the Hotel Europa that was a wonderfully comfortable place to relax. I agree with all other reviewers that the staff, led by Gassim, are all incredibly accommodating and kind. With a restful sleep in our big suite (and it truly was a large room, especially for Europe) and a nice breakfast spread to start our day before sightseeing, it was a terrific place to stay in Florence. I would definitely recommend it to family and friends visiting Florence.

<Content>You won't want to leave! Staying in the Hotel Europa helped make my trip to Florence really special. All the staff gave such a warm welcome and made it feel like home -I didn't want to leave! The beautiful view from my room of the Duomo and belltower was such a bonus.The only drawback is the sound-proofing within the hotel itself is not the best, I could hear people talking at night and moving around in the morning but it wasn't too disturbing. Breakfast was very satisfying and kept me going most of the day. Overall I would highly reccommend this hotel to anyone staying in Florence, -I know I will definately be back many, many times.

<Content>A homey hotel in the heart of the city My wife and I found this hotel through this website and everything is just like what the reviews say. At first we were a bit surprised by the small entrance and the old elevator, but we felt right at home as soon as we were welcome by Gassim, the owner.All hotel staff are very kind and helpful. Especially, David who helped us get the tickets for a Series A soccer match, which was very difficult to find.We would recommend the suite room on the second floor as it's more spacious and has a comfortable bathroom.

<Content>Fantastic family-run hotel I thought that the service and hospitality of the owners of this hotel was so exceptional that it deserved a mention. The hotel itself is due a bit of renovation and is very basic. It is however extremely clean and is so centrally located that it makes it an ideal budget choice. I have stayed in many hotels of all different levels and I have to say that this has been the most welcoming reception that I have ever had. This was particularly appreciated, as I was travelling on my own. Would definately recommend it to budget business travellers, families and single travellers!

<Content>Thoroughly recommend it! Just got back from our stay at Hotel Europa and had a great time! The location is fab - 2 mins walk from the Duomo and about 5/10 mins to the station. We stayed in a double suite and it was great - large room with huge shuttered windows and we had a not bad view of a courtyard type thing and could see the turret of the duomo. We didn't make it to breakfast as the we had such good nights sleep we didn't wake until 10 each morning!Everyone was so helpful and recommended good areas to go and eat - we ate at Trattoria Za Za which was really good food and not pricy. By the way thoroughly recommend the hot chocolate at Caffe Fiorenze near the Piazza della Signoria(the one with all the statues) - pure liquid chocolate!!!Only minor gripe - tv was very small and didn't have any english channels but pretty unimportant during the stay!

<Content>Great Trip We had a great stay in Florence. The Hotel Europa, run by Gassim and his sister Miriam, was conveniently located for walking to most sights. The room was very nice and quiet, and we had a good rate. The staff was friendly, polite, and helpful in every way. We slept well and had a nice continental breakfast in the morning. There are so many good places to eat or have cafe in Florence, that we were never far from a great meal. Hotel Europa suited our needs perfectly.It appeared that part of the hotel had been recently refurnished, and that is the part we stayed in. You might want to ask about that when reserving a room. I did not see the whole hotel, but we were on the first floor. To get there, take a taxi from the airport or the railway station, although you could easily walk from the station with a backpack or light luggage.Our original plans were to rent a car for traveling and park it at the hotel while in Florence. Even though we had the car rented for a longer period, we just returned it in Florence rather than pay the parking fee and fight with one-way streets. Nevertheless, I did experience rush hour driving in Florence more than once. Oddly the kaotic driving style grew on me, and I found the drivers more polite and forgiving than Americans. If it were not for road signs I couldn't read, a random street plan, and the maze of one-way streets that make up Florence, driving would have been fun. Take my advice and experience European driving somewhere else, unless you have lots of time on your hands.

<Content>very pleasant place tostay we have recently returned from a short break in florence and stayed at the hotel europa. our stay was made more memorable by the kind attention of the owners who couldnt do enough to help us enjoy our break. gassim got up early on our last day to serve us breakfast, even though the breakfast was not officially served until 7.30.and we had to leave early.our room was very large and nicely decorated and spotlessly clean.it was extremely central for all the sights and miriam was able to advise us on reasonable and good places to eat which was a real bonus. we would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and have already told our friends about it..

<Content>Great location and great service Very nice hotel, in a very good location. We were upgraded to the 1st floor rooms, which were large and clean with nice tile floors. The breakfast was the best we had in Italy, with a great selection including hot croissants. The service was very good, and nice to have internet access in the hotel lobby. We stayed 2 nights because of the reviews in tripadvisor, we were not let down.

<Content>Great place! My husband and I stayed here with our 15-year-old son in July. We had reserved a standard room but were told upon arrival that it would not fit three and were instead put in a suite for about 10 euro more per night. We weren't happy at the switch until we spent three nights in the room -- it was spacious, clean and air-conditioned, with a large bathroom. The location was extremely convenient -- a short walk to the Duomo and the Accademia, and not much farther to the train station. No outside noise filtered in. Added bonuses were free Internet, a substantial enough breakfast to keep us going till lunch, and the graciousness of owner Gassim. We paid 120 euro per night, making it one of the pricier places we we stayed during two weeks in Europe. But we would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>We loved the Hotel Europa! We stayed at the Hotel Europa from Dec 5 to Dec 11 and loved our entire time there. The location is great, very close to the train station and right across the street from the main tourist office. It is also within walking distance to the main attractions. The staff was very friendly and had great suggestions for restaurants and were willing to make reservations for museums for us. Our room (#47)was huge and had a cute little balcony that looked into a courtyard. The breakfast was simple (cereal, granola, milk, yogurt, bread jam, and, most importantly, great cappuccinos) but plentiful. They also have a computer with free internet for all the guests to use, which is so useful for finding out the weather and train/bus schedules and interesting sights in Florence. All in all, we loved the Hotel Europa and would stay there again if we return to Florence!

<Content>Very Friendly Hotel, Great Location My husband and I were married in Florence in September 2005. Because we were traveling with 5 other members of our family we chose the Hotel Europa mainly for the price; however the location was wonderful, just blocks from the Duomo. The Hotel lobby is located on the 3rd floor of an average building but they have beautiful suites on the 2nd floor. I would suggest paying the little bit extra for a suite, the second floor sitting room is a perfect place to gather and relax. We booked 4 rooms which included one of the suites the other rooms were large although definitely not as warm as the suites but 2 of them had a nice view of the Duomo dome. We stayed for 2 nights and moved to a different hotel after our wedding but our family stayed for 4 nights and had a wonderful visit. Breakfast is served in a large breakfast/sitting room and it was pretty generous compared to some of the other places we stayed. The family lives in the building and they are very helpful even arranging to have my wedding dress and 3 tuxedos pressed upon our arrival. The only complaint I had was that you have to be in by 1:00am or make arrangements prior to your departure because the main street door is locked. Also, we got locked out of the second floor suite section because we forgot our key when we went up to the lobby. These minor inconveniences aside we truly enjoyed our stay and the price, location, and wonderful family who run the hotel more then makeup for any of the downfalls.

<Content>Great location, fair price, wonderful service We stayed in two different rooms. A double when there were just two of us and a triple suite when there were three of us. Both rooms were absolutely spotless. The breakfast was nothing fancy but good and the coffee was wonderful. It was nice having access to the internet. And it's a great location, easy to get to all the major sites. I will definately stay there again the next time I am in Florence and will recommend it to all my friends.

<Content>Wonderful spot We stayed unexpectedly at the Hotel Europa courtesy of the hotel we had originally reserved having water problems. It turned out to be a wonderful change in plans!! The room was clean and comfortable, complete with heavy wooden shutter and its own fresco on the ceiling. The proprietors were gracious and welcoming. The location of the hotel was very convenient to the major spots to visit in Florence. Breakfast in the dining room was a treat in the morning, our luggage was safely kept after checkout while we spent the day in Florence and the young man at the desk had a cab waiting when we had to (reluctantly) leave. When we return to Florence, which we hope to do, we will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Friendly and Clean My husband and I have just returned from Florence, Italy and stayed at Hotel Europa. The people were very helpful with everything, especially Gassim, and my husband was so impressed how clean it was. Prices are very reasonable. The restaurant that was recommended for dinner was amazing--exceptional food and very close to the hotel. Everyone was great and answered all of our questions (and we had many). The location was perfect. The only problem we had was keeping the water in the shower area. Thank you Hotel Europa for a great time!Sharon and Joe Zimmer

<Content>Loved the room My boyfriend and I stayed in Hotel Europa for 3 nights. We paid a little extra for our room (definitley worth doing so). I have to say it is one of the best hotel rooms I have stayed in. Each room has its own charm and character making it very unique.In terms of room facilites we had problems with our hot water on the first day but that was sorted pretty much straight away. Also just to note if you do stay here it is worth bringing a travel iron with you as there are no ironing facitlities. Breakfast at the hotel was very simple and basic-lets just say it fills a hole.In terms of location this hotel is fantastic. All major sights and tourist attractions are within walking distance!What was nice about the hotel was the fact it was family owned- the owner knew our names and greeted us personally when we went down for breakfast.Overall a nice and friendly place to stay in!!

<Content>Great Place to Stay in Florence Hotel Europa is centrally located and reasonably priced. We had a large room with two windows that looked out on an interior courtyard. Room rates include a full breakfast, and the hotel has an internet terminal for guests to use, as well as bottled water and other beverages available at about half the price charged on the street. The staff is very welcoming, and quick to assist with directions, restaurant recommendations, taxi service and other requests. The entrance to the hotel is inside a doorway. Look closely or you may walk by without knowing it.

<Content>Hotel Europa - a pleasant surprise This hotel surprised us in many ways. First we took a cab after dropping off our car at Hertz (a whole other story in itself). It was pouring rain and then we pulled up in front of a building that didn't have a lot of direction. In deed, the elevator (lift) was the smallest ever. Inevitably, I got in the elevator w/our luggage - not much! and my husband climbed the stairs. We had a wonderfuly warm welcome. We chose to stay in a standard room, there on the 2nd flr (we would consider it the 3rd). There was a little noise, but we survived. Not like we didn't make noise of our own! The room was clean, large and had a small patio with small table and chairs. The bathroom was less than to be desired - and very very small. Once you took a shower, everything was wet... that is the only downfall. It is my understanding the suites on the 1st flr (would be considered our 2nd) are bigger. However, for budget accommodations - this is good!The breakfast was plentiful. Yogurt, cereal, bread, cheese, juice, coffee/tea.Free internet in the lobby - til 10pm. Can update logs and emails, though we chose to go to an internet cafe around the corner to upload photos (cheap!).Before arrival, I had emailed the hotel asking if they could make the reservations for Uffizi and Accademia. Oh my gosh it was great! They emailed me my confirmation code, I got in line to get tickets and it worked. No hassle, no extra fees, etc. The morning we left we got up before anyone else in the hotel - including the staff! So we settled the bill the night before and we received a nice goodie bag of soda, water and croissants to ensure we got some breakfast that morning. Completely unexpected and VERY much apprecited!The staff were always friendly, available and welcoming. Very family oriented with a great sense of humor. This hotel was close to everything - at first I wasn't so sure, but the hotel has a great pocket map that can be used to get anywhere. If you are ever in Florence - eat at ZaZa's. AWESOME food and FANTASTIC house wine!!!

<Content>Clean, comfortable, and convenient My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Europa for two nights in early November, and chose the standard double room to save some money. We were very pleased with the convenience of the hotel. It was a short walk from the Duomo, Accademia, Uffizi, Bargello, and many other sights. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Our room was fairly large, but the bathroom was typically small. The bed was comfortable and everything was very clean. The furnishings were basic. We got a good deal directly from the hotel via e-mail before leaving the USA (quoted 90 Euros), but, when we were there, I noticed that they had an 80 Euro per night deal advertised on their website. (Internet access was available in the lobby.) I mentioned it and our rate was reduced to 80 Euros. On another positive note, I was unable to directly obtain a reservation for the Uffizi Gallery, but I sent the Hotel Europa an e-mail asking for help, and they were able to get it right away for our desired date and time! We would *definitely* stay there again!

<Content>Budget Hotel - although quite nice My partner  I chose this budget hotel for our 4 night stay in Florence. When we first arrived, the taxi stopped in front of a rather depressing store front. We struggled with our luggage in the world鈥檚 smallest elevator 鈥?we only had one large luggage item each. But things improved with the help of the very friendly staff. The room was also unusually large and very quiet. We had a nice view with large open windows. The location was also quite close to the Duomo. While the hotel was cheaper than other options, it may not have had the qualities of more expensive hotels. However, the staff was very helpful and friendly; the bedroom and bathroom were quite large; the room was very quiet (at one point we thought we were the only ones in the hotel); the windows were huge and opened onto a very pretty and calming backyard; the breakfast was your standard meal; and the hotel was conveniently located to the big sights. As a gay couple, the hotel was comfortable and welcoming. The only slight negative comment is that the bed was hard as a rock. If you鈥檙e looking for less expensive lodging, this is definitely your best bet 鈥?as the service was sincerely helpful and the room was very peaceful (especially after a day of walking through the crowds of tourists).

The manager/owner (Gassim) lives on the premises and seems to be there 24/7 to serve you breakfast, answer your questions and help with directions, tickets, etc. I must also mention Miriam and her husband as well as David who were the best! Location is within a few steps of everything. This hotel far exceeded our expectations.

<Content>Not as expected, but still a good value We had a pleasant stay at Hotel Europa at the end of October. The room was not what we expected though. Just make sure when you book that you request the suites on the 1st floor. The room we were in was on the 2nd floor and the decor left much to be desired. The room was large but the carpet was old and the walls stark without any frames or color. The pictures on their website only show the suites. On the plus side, the customer service was excellent and Roberto was very hospitable.

<Content>Hotel Europa is wonderful Hotel Europa was a delight. The owner and staff were extremely warm and helpful. Breakfast is substantial, and there was free access to the internet in the hotel lobby. And indeed, we had a room with a view of the Duomo. The hotel is very centrally located, and our room, which looked out on the courtyard was very quiet. While the suite did not have a separate sitting room, the room was clean, bright and spacious, and included a little hallway to our private bathroom. The price was very reasonable. I highly recommend this hotel and would go back anytime.

<Content>Hotel Europa should be your choice too!! We stayed at Hotel Europa for 8 days during our recent trip to Florence (Oct 2005) and it turned out to be an excellent choice of accomodation for us. The hotel is famed for its beautiful Florentine styled suites and we were offered an amazing suite at an even more amazing price! Each suite is individually named with it's own colour scheme. Ours had a deep rich red colour theme. The sheer size is unbelievable! The room door opens into a huge living area with a few large, comfortable sofa chairs (that we later pushed together to create a sofa bed for lounging), a side table (which we later used for our late night cozy suppers), a TV set and lots and lots of space. The bedroom is separate and also very big. It has it's own TV set too. Everything was clean and very comfortable. There were beautiful ceiling frescos both in the living and bedroom. The rooms had triple windows so there was no noise disturbance at all. The bathroom comes with a shower box which surprisingly was like a mini spa with sauna facilities and also numerous water jets that could be activated for a spa-like bath massage. Apart from the room itself, the winning aspect of Hotel Europa has got to be it's owners. Gassim, his daughter Miriam and David are all very helpful and made our stay extremely welcoming. From the moment we stepped in and were showed to our room, the service never stopped. Both Gassim and Miriam gave excellent restaurant recommendations (you must try El Gatto  La Volpe- in my opinion the best italian pasta and pizza we had in Florence, just ask them where to find it), helped us to make museum reservations, car garage reservations, directions etc. The one thing that stood out and is truly worth mentioning is when we found extra pillows placed in our room without us even requesting for it. We had brought the sofa chair pillows into the bedroom to lean on while we watched TV and left it there the next morning. When we came back that night, we found extra pillows placed in the bedroom for us. We didn't even have to ask, our needs was silently met and we were truly thankful and appreciative of that! Breakfast each morning is from 7:30-9:30a.m and the spread very good with ham, salami, cheese, croissants, toast bread slices, cereal, boiled eggs, excellent cappuccino and more. They have an elevator and also provide free internet usage which was a big plus for us. The price of the suites are very affordable. Contact the hotel directly and they will quote you their best rates. The location totally convenient in proximity to many of the main attractions in Florence. I can't think of any drawbacks to choosing this hotel. We had a wonderful stay and confidently recommend Hotel Europa to anyone who wants a home away from home.

<Content>Great service We recently spent nearly a week in Florence, Italy, and stayed at the Hotel Europa. We were very happy with the location (two blocks from the Duomo), and the service was excellent. Gassim, Miriam, and David were more than willing to answer any questions we had, and Miriam went out of her way to arrange for a driver to take us for a nine-hour trip into the Tuscan countryside. We felt like family! Our room was on the first floor and was clean and comfortable, with typical Florentine-style furniture, and looked out onto a lovely courtyard with a view to the Duomo. The bathroom was spotless, with all modern conveniences. We will not hesitate to recommend Hotel Europa to anyone heading to Florence.

<Content>Ya gotta love it! Not expecting something this great in a hotel is always a pleasure when you arrive and are greeted by lovely staff who take you to a fantastic room overlooking the main street Yes the windows are double glazed so there is no noise. The staff were fantastic and the location is the best. Make sure you ask for an upgrade when you book direct with the hotel Have safe travels.

<Content>magnificent suites we stayed at the hotel europa in september 2005. we found the hospitality amazing. the father is quite a character. they went beyond our expectations in every way. my advice is to pay extra for the suites as they have 15 foot ceilings and are much much bigger than the normal rooms. also contact the hotel directly for the best prices.

<Content>I would highly recommend - We loved our stay We loved our stay at Hotel Europa. Our hosts Gassim  Miriam were very friendly, extremely helpful  respectful at all times. We enjoyed our beautiful large suite (bigger than average!), lovely clean bathroom  very nice view. Good air-con - large comfy beds. Great location just near the famous Dome Cathedral  not far from the train station. The breafast was ok - good coffee but the croisants left a bit to be desired. That could be improved perhaps - but all in all I would highly recommend this excellent value for money and delightful hotel. I'll definately stay there again when next in beautiful Florence.

<Content>American style comfort in the heart of Florence Lovely, hospitable, comfortable with all the amenities that an American tourist would dream of. In the heart of Florence, on Via Cavour, and about two blocks from the famous Cathedral popularly called the Duomo, and the bell tower of Giotto. Some of the rooms have great views of the dome and the belltower. It is a well furnished hotel, with amenities such as remodelled bathrooms with showers with towel warmers, hair dryers, and 120V/240V ellectric outlets, individual room heaters and air conditioners, refridgerator hidden in a handpainted desk.Close to the central train and bus station, where you catch buses or trains for day trips to Chianti region or elsewhere.Moderately priced with 5 star ambience. Wonderful service from the family that has owned it for more than 30 years. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Florence!

<Content>A Wonderful place to Stay We had a wonderful time staying at the Hotel Europa in Florence. The location is fabulous. It is very near all the major sites. The rooms were spotlessly clean. The service was excellent. Best of all, the owners and staff made us feel like a member of their family. This is a wonderful value for your money. Stay there, you will love it.

<Content>Centrally Located Hotel Europa is quaint, centrally located near the Duomo and Santa Maria Novella train station and their staff is very accommodating. Both Gassim and his daughter, Miriam, went out of their way to make us feel at home during our (too brief) stay. I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for value and wants to be in the heart of the historic district.

<Content>Loved the Europa! Gassim was Sweetheart and taught me some Italian!The hotel was really beautifully decorated and clean. I had a double room which was more spacious than some other places I've stayed.It was a less than a block from the Duomo and very central to other sights. It couldn't have been more convenient!I was traveling alone, and felt very safe there. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Not as represented We didn't actually stay at Hotel Europa, we had made reservations for a suite and when we arrived apparently there were none remaining. While the gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and helpful, the room we got instead was not in any way acceptable, more like a dorm room than a hotel. The shower was only 2 folding doors that connected and no basin, water just onto the floor, and if the shower doors were closed you could not use the toilet. The furniture was old, looked cheap, and the hotel did not feel clean. We stayed there only long enough to find anther hotel.The location was convenient, and they did offer guests internet access.

<Content>Fantastic location The Hotel Europa is the most centrally located hotel I could see in Florence - about 2 mins walk from all the main attractions. The Duomo, Giotto's bell tower, the baptistry are one way and the Academy Gallery (Home of David) is the other. It is also very central for shops, restauarants and the fantastic market stalls selling everything from shoes to handbags.We had a huge room - 1 double bed and 1 single for 2 people with a view of the Duomo and a big bathroom. The buffet breakfast was great and all served by the incredibly friendly owner Gassim. I would highly recommend this hotel - one thing book the Uffizi Gallery before you go as we missed out !!!!!!

<Content>Excellent The hotel ia excellent in all respects and just a few minutes walk from all the main sights. We stayed for 5 nights in a suite room which was beautifully furnished in traditional Florentine style. The bathroom was large and the shower worked well. There was a small fridge in the room which was very useful. Thoughtfully, a plug in insect killer was provided in the room so the mosquitoes were not a problem. Everything you might need had been thought of and provided.The breakfasts were good and plentiful and the famous coffee machine provided endless excellent coffee.The greatest charm of this small hotel are Gassim and his daughter Miriam who together cannot do enough to ensure the comfort of their guests. Nothing is too much trouble. The young man on the desk, whose name we unfortuneately didn't find out, and the rest of the staff were also very friendly and helpful.Although they all spoke perfect English we had asked them to speak to us in Italian which we have been studying hard for a year. This they did with considerable patience and encouragement and to Gassim's great amusement.When we left we felt we were leaving friends and cannot wait to return.

<Content>Best service in Italy First off, the hotel is centrally located in Florence. You are easily able to walk to all major sights. The rooms were clean and comfortable - I would recommend you book a suite for 20E more - definitely worth it. The thing that stands out more than anything was the service. We received the Ritz Carlton treatment as soon as we walked in the door. Gassim, his daughter and staff made our honeymoon quite memorable.the montana's

<Content>Hotel Europa highly recommended My wife and I spent 2 days/1 night in Florence and stayed at the family-run Hotel Europa in early September 2005. We stayed in a Superior Double Room.Our Europe holiday involved touring around all day and using hotels as a base for sleeping and showering. So our criteria for hotels was location, cleanliness and a comfortable bed and Hotel Europa passed all these with flying colours.The lack of street frontage and drab ground floor lobby may seem to be a worry, but once you go up the lift you are reminded not to judge a book by its cover. This is a fine hotel that more than meets 3-star standard IMO. Also, I was able to arrange reserved tickets to the Uffizi and Galleria through the hotel (by email correspondence) with no fuss. POSITIVES:Very clean. Great location, walking distance to most attractions and SM Novella train station. Very friendly and helpful family, nothing was too much trouble. Example, my wife had a painful pinched nerve, Miriam stopped what she was doing and spent over 30mins trying to find a therapist in town who could treat it. Very large rooms and bathroom (by Italian standards). The breakfast included in the rate is standard continental but more than adequate to start the day.NEGATIVES Nil.

<Content>"A" for Location, Value and Hospitality Beside the fact that the Hotel Europe is in a great location (easily walk-able from the train station and rooms within eye shot of the Duomo) the staff really goes the extra step to make you feel welcomed and comfortable. The rooms were well kept and an added bonus was the computer in the lobby with free internet access. A highlight of the breakfast room was the self-serve coffee/espresso/cappuccino machine-it served surprisingly good java. The atmosphere was warm and friendly and it was nice to chat with fellow travelers from all over, many of them repeat visitors to the Hotel Europa.Great value, great hospitalityVince da Silva

<Content>All the reviews were true After a recommendation from a friend and reading some Trip Advisor reviews we booked 3 days at this hotel during our honeymoon in September. I booked via email directly with the hotel which was very pleasant and easy. Knowing we would be spending very little time in the hotel it was nice to come back after a long day of site seeing to relax in our suite. The recently renovated floor looks fantastic and our room was great. Miriam and the gang are fantastic! Excellent recommendations on restaurants in the area and helpful in booking museum tickets. Location is perfect, close to the train station makes for a quick cab ride and hitting the main sites. A very special personal touch.

Rooms were large, nice bathrooms---it was a little on the warm side (there is only a small air conditioning unit). Our time at Hotel Europa made our stay in Florence a joy!

<Content>Great place to stay The location is perfect - just a few minutes' walk to the Duomo (just a block and a half away). It is on a wider street and a bus route. Less than 10 mins. by bus from railway station. The No. 7 bus runs from right outside the railway station (one euro each) - once you see the Duomo and the Baptistry you are almost there - the bus turns left onto via Martelli (which is only one block long) and you get off at Via Martelli - the bus stop is at the end of the block - walk in the direction the bus took - the street becomes Via Cavour and the hotel is about halfway up the next block on the right. There is a wide staircase and a smallish lift. The building is three stories above street level, and the hotel occupies the first and second floors. The reception is on the second floor. The hotel is very, very clean, and very safe. It is a safe area. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Ghassim, the owner, was really great and speaks fluent English, and was a great host - Maria too, and all the staff were friendly and so nice. Breakfast consists of fresh bread rolls, pkgd croissants, butter/jams/honey, cheese, fruit yogurts, cereals, orange juice, and a push-button machine that makes coffee, cappaccino, and there is tea - it is served from 7.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. At reception there is one computer which guests can use to access the web and read their emails. The first floor rooms have recently been refurbished and the floor looks great. Apparently the second floor will be updated soon. We were on the second floor and loved our room. It was a very enjoyable stay. We were extremely pleased with our choice and would stay here again without hesitation.Train travellers beware. In Venice, and also in Florence, the ticket teller at the railway station held back E5 when giving us our change. Both times we pointed out we were short and the missing note would be handed over. In Florence an Italian man had the same thing happen to him when we were there. Buy your tickets a day or so ahead of time, and count your change before leaving the ticket window. Good idea to count out your notes to them so they know what they receive from you.

<Content>wonderfully welcoming My family stayed at Hotel Europa for four nights in June. We felt welcomed and cared for from the start when Miriam brought us a cool drink after our hot walk from the train station. The rooms were large and comfortable with the best bathrooms of our stay in Italy, the breakfasts were just right before a day of sightseeing, and the internet access was greatly appreciated by all (especially my teenage son!) The location was perfect for getting around and Miriam was most helpful with suggestions for the train for a day trip to Lucca and museum reservations. The slight problem with the airconditioning was corrected quickly and assistance with getting clothes cleaned (for seven people after two weeks of travel) was outstanding. We feel like we have friends in Florence now...and I hope we get to visit again!

<Content>Great place to stay in Florence... My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Europa at the very end of July. Florence was our favorite of all the cities we visited on our three-week trip through Italy, and Hotel Europa was a great place to stay.Our room was quite large and the air conditioning was excellent. The bathroom was small and without a separate shower stall, but the hotel was very up front about that, so I knew about it ahead of time. In retrospect, next time I will pay more to upgrade to the suites, which have separate tubs or shower stalls. The room and bathroom were cleaned thoroughly each day. Our room offered a view of a great courtyard, and the Duomo was visible over the roof. The breakfast was more than enough to keep my husband and I satisfied. Of particular note was the impressive coffee/cappucino/espresso machine. It was great fun to use, and tasted better than the cappucino I paid 2 euros for down the street! Gassim and his family were very helpful and could not have been nicer. They arranged Uffizi tickets for us, and made great restaurant recommendations. They also offer a laundry service, which saved us from having to spend an afternoon in a laundromat. For about 15 euros we had a couple of weeks' worth of dirty clothes picked up, washed and dried, and delivered back to our room.By far the best thing about the Hotel Europa is its location. It is within a few minutes walk of everything there is to see in Florence. We had just spent hours walking from place to place in Rome, so it was strange to be at the Duomo or the Ponte Vecchio in less than 10 minutes. Walk the other direction and you're at the open-air market or the train station in the same amount of time.In the end, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to our friends and family. The price was great, the service was great, and we loved Florence. Hope to stay at the Hotel Europa again!

<Content>Fantastic start to our honeymoon We chose Florence for the start of our honeymoon and the Hotel Europa because of the reviews on TripAdvisor. And it didn't disappoint. We arrived late at the airport and got a taxi to the Hotel. Slightly expensive. but it was midnight and we'd just got married the night before!!! We were greeted at reception and shown straight to our suite which was very spacious and had a terrific view of the Duomo. We loved the old fashioned lift. It reminded us of an early James Bond film. The room was excellent and cleaned everyday and the bathroom had a bath large enough for two!!! The location of the hotel was fantastic. Right in the middle of everything. We walked and walked all over Florence and couldn't have wished for a better base from which to leave from. One direction led to the Duomo and the city, the other to covered markets and the 'old' town. Just excellent. It set the tone for a great honeymoon.

<Content>Wonderful welcome for weary travelers Don't be put off by the less than inviting exterior, or by the cramped old-fashioned lift, because once you reach the second floor reception desk you will be glad you selected this hotel. Gassim was a charming, helpful, warm host who greeted us by name every time we met. Having arrived after an overnight train ride from Paris around 8:00 a.m., we were tired, and in need of a shower and something other than a water closet. Our reserved quad room was not ready that early, so Gassim upgraded us to a suite, took us to the room and helped with the luggage. He even brought us bottled water and ice before we could settle in. We could not have asked for a better host. The suite was absolutely lovely, comfortable, and spacious. The A/C was adequate, but shut off when the key was removed which we did as we left the room each day. The bathroom was the largest bathroom we experienced in 3 weeks of travel in Ireland, England, France and Italy. The hotel was within comfortable walking distance (10-15 minutes) of the city center and all of the traditional sights (Accademia, Uffizi, Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, etc.). Gassim also recommended a restaurant called Za-Za which was charming with good food, reasonably priced. The breakfast was no better or no worse than any other breakfast we had in Europe. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great location, spacious room and warm hospitality Does not look inviting from the outside, the reception is on the second floor accessed via a tiny lift. We were pleasantly surprised by the large spacious room and the warmth and friendliness of our host who spoke very good english and was extremely helpful. The location is perfect, 15 mins walk from the station and about 5 mins from the center of Florence with a tourist information office just across the road.The main downside was that the bathroom was tiny and the water from the shower flooded the bathroom. Also the airconditioning is turned off from the mains around midnight, this happened all 3 nights I was there.The quality of the breakfast has not improved.

<Content>Perfection in Central Florence! The Hotel Europa is the perfect place in Florence. It's within 2 minutes walking distance of the Duomo, and thus, is cental to all the other main sights. It is very reasonably and fairly priced. As it's a family run hotel, the service, hospitality, standards, attention to detail are superb. Gassim, the owner, is the one of the most charming and helpful people we've met. Not only did we enjoy talking to him about many different topics, he always gave us excellent advice. Thanks to Gassim, we were able to secure advance tickets to the Uffizi with a short walk and a few minutes' wait. On Gassim's recommendations, we had some excellent meals at 2 local restaurants within easy walking distance. We felt we were staying in a home away from home. the rooms were safe, secure, and immaculately clean. The bathroms are small, but no problem as you're only in the bathroom for a short time every day. Apart from Gassim's friendliness and hospitality, we really appreciated how close the Hotel Europa was to everything. The time saved by this alone was phenomenal; that way we could squeeze as much sightseeing/appreciation of Florence's beauty, as much as possible. If desired, we could swing by regularly to freshen up or to drop off parcels. Hotel Europa is the place to stay in Florence!

<Content>Hotel Europa is a best bet We stayed at the Hotel Europa for our 3-day stay in Florence in August 2005. We were hesitant at first, but quickly found the hotel had an attentive staff, a wonderful location, a quiet spacious room (we had a suite room with a private bathroom) with a quaint view of a quiet courtyard.Regarding our room - the bed was firm, the room was quiet (we could not hear any road/alley noise or other guests), the bathroom was larger than some we have experienced in Europe, and the AC worked quietly and efficiently (critical for a visit in August).We coordinated our reservation through Gassim, and he took care of us very well during our stay.

<Content>Impressive This hotel completely met our expectations. Only 2 blocks from the Duomo and also close to the main train station, the manager was also extremley helpful with his recommendations regarding nearby eating establishments. We stayed in one of the newley remolded suites...a must. it was the biggest room we stayed in, in all of italy. They went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable. A DEFINITE MUST if your planning to stay in Florence.

<Content>A Wonderful Pick Everything about this hotel was wonderful! When we arrived in Florence by train from Rome we took a taxi to this hotel (a good idea, although it wasn't too far, but you don't want to be walking the narrow streets of Florence with luggage. When you first arrive at the hotel I must admit it is a little strange. The entrance to the hotel is actually on the second story of a non-descript building in Florence. You must either take an small elevator to the second floor or walk the stairs (not a big deal after you have dropped off your luggage). After getting past the first impressions, we were warmly welcomed by a sweet lady who spoke wonderful English (a relief after a few days in Rome). We told her our last name and she treated us as if she had been expecting us for years! She walked us through beautifully decorated hallways to our room. Once there she walked us in and immediatly opened the windows to let in the fresh breeze from the gardens below. Then she began explaining the amenities and made us feel right at home. Our bathroom was down a hallway from our room and I immediatly became concerned that it was a shared bathroom (a common thing in Italy). She laughed and reasurred me that the entire hallway, along with the bathroom, was ours (the doorway at the end of the hallway was the entrance to our room). In essence we not only had a beautiful room, but also a beautiful entrance. Our stay at Hotel Europa was nothing short of wonderful! Each morning we were greeted as family and the hosts were very open with suggestions and hints about the city. One piece of advice.. we chose to stay in the suite room Dante rather than the standard rooms. The price difference wasn't much, although I'm sure the standard rooms are just fine, also. Finally, the bathroom and shower were large. When we visit Florence again we will definatley stay at Hotel Europa. One more wonderful thing...it is in a central location in Florence. We could see the Duomo from our room. Happy Travels!

<Content>Coolest place in Italy Wow what cant I say about this place, first it is centrally located about a 2 minute walk from the Duomo. Second when I was there it was game 7 of the NBA finals (Pistons vs. Spurs) and I am from metro Detroit and they did not have the game at the hotel, the receptionist who is the owners daughter spend about at least an hour on the phone finding me another hotel or pub to watch it at. Third the A/C actually worked and got cold enough to cool the room down a first for us. Lastly the breakfast lacked a little but it is Italy and no breakfast is a good one and this place was better than most. i urge anyone to stay at Hotel Europa.

<Content>Ideal Hotel The Europa Hotel lived up to all expectations. It is ideally located for all the tourist attractions. The room was very clean and comfortable and the shower very adequate. The breakfast was very basic but adequate as there were plenty of places in the local area that you could visit to get further refreshments. The owner was extremely friendly and helpful and I will return when I next visit Florence.

<Content>Europa Hotel Stayed at the Europa June 2005. Good hotel in great position 5 min walk to most of main sites 15 -20 min walk from station. Had a suite which was roomy and over looked a court yard at rear so was very quiet. Also had air con which was essential when visiting at this time. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Magnificent Hotel I have stayed at Hotel Europa with my family for a week. It was a lovely and an unforgettable stay. The owner, Mr Ghassim and his lovely and ever smiling daughter, Miriam have made sure that we get the most out of our trip to Florence, not to mention the royal and unbiased hospiality they extend to their guests. My daugher Nadia, was so enamoured to the owner that she keeps bugging me to preplan our next trip to florence. A barbie doll given to her by him is well cherished and maintained. This gesture touches us enormously. The hotel is very clean and its location at the heart of florence simplified our visting historic places. Mr Ghassim is so well seasoned that every question we asked about florence was well answered. His daughterand him are linguistics and that was a great help. In a nutshell, we enjoyed our visit to florence and in particular Hotel Europa and we have got far more than our money's worth, and this trip reminded me another one that I did in seoul and Hongkong sometime before the olympics. I stayed in Lotta Hotel in seoul and the Holiday Inn in Hongkong and both places I was treated like a king as every need was answered with a bow.Abdulaziz Sufi Omar

<Content>Absolutely Terrific Hotel My friend and I recently stayed in the Hotel Europa and it was one of the nicest hotels we stayed in Italy. This is a family run hotel with a personal touch. Miriam and Gassim were so very kindand hospitable. The rooms are immaculate and very spacious. It is also very reasonably priced. The hotel is located very close to the Duoma. Just a wonderful location. I would highly recommend it. I think it is rated as a 2 star but I would rate it as at least a 3 star.

<Content>Excellent Service Rooms were decent and clean. Bathroom was not great at all. Each time I took a shower, I flooded the bathroom floor. However, the service provided from Mr. Gassim was excellent. He recommended places to visit for us and treated us like we were his children. He took great care of us. THe hotel is also centrally located and walking distance to major sites. Will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Gassim- What A Legend Gorgeous little hotel in a spot on central location- just down the road from the Duomo and San Lorenzo, only a short walk from the rest of the major sights. On the same road, literally a few metres, from the Palazzo Medici (must see). Breakfast is a good selection, and the atmosphere is cosy enough to feel at home, yet also extremely professional.We booked a standard room but for some strange reason got upgraded for free (!) to the suite rooms at the front of the hotel. Therefore I can't really comment on the standard accomodation, but judging from the lovliness of our suite I'm assuming it's pretty good. We even had old painted ceilings- would be interested to know what sort of a history the building has.The owners are great and Gassim is a legend. Um.... the only thing I can fault really is that on most descriptions it says 'on a quiet road'- which certainly isn't true! Because the hotel is located so centrally, Via Cavour on which it is situated is a pretty big, busy road! I think most of the rooms at the back of the hotel however would be pretty quiet in spite of this. Do not book the suite if you're sensitive to noise, it's right at the front of the hotel and looks out onto the road- noisy even on quiet nights.

<Content>Great Location, Price and Service We had a most enjoyable stay for 4 nights towards end of June at Hotel Europa. Originally, we had only reserved for 3 nights, but Gassim and Miriam were kind enough to accommodate our needs, which involved switching us for several nights to a beautiful room with a balcony and great view of the Duomo. We ate a nice breakfast on the balcony. The two restaurant recommendations that Gassim gave us were both outstanding (I can still taste the truffle-infused sauce on the spinach ricotta ravioli; and the Eggplant Parmesan was simply yummy). Additionally, Gassim helped to arrange for an excellent tour of the Uffizi Gallery which typically requires weeks for a normal reservation. For the price and location, you can鈥檛 beat Hotel Europa in Florence (they also offered us a discount for cash payment). The only recommendations to Gassim and Miriam would be to only use fresh croissants for breakfast (instead of the pre-packaged ones they serve), and make the computer with Internet access available to at least midnight or later (they turn it off at 10pm currently). Otherwise, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and plan to come back again next time in Florence. Their service and hospitality was top-notch, something one would only expect at a 4 star hotel.

<Content>my home far away from home It was already the third time that I stayed in this hotel( once with a friend of mine, then alone and the last time with my sister). Everytime I return to Florence I check in in the lovely Hotel Europa wich is situated in the city centre and near all the famous objects of interests. Nice staff, beautiful rooms, good price, perfect location. I would recommend it to everyone. I'll return there as soon as possible because I feel as if I were at home in this lovely hotel in Florence!

<Content>Charming little hotel the Hotel Europa is a charming littel hotel, centrally located in the middle of Florence. The rooms are small, but this is more than overcome by the hospitality of the owner/staff and the reasonable price. The room with the balcony is especially attractive, and provides a peaceful setting after a day of touring.

<Content>LOVED IT! The hotel is great, location is great, price (for Florence) is great, but the big score is Mirriam, Gassim and family!! We wanted to take them home with us. From someone who's stayed in a LOT of hotels, you can't go wrong with this place if you're looking for a very nice (not fancy), clean, freindly, centrally located hotel with an old world charm feel to it and the sweetest and warmest hospitality that is so essential when traveling.

<Content>The best buy in Florence This hotel was a great find. The locatiion is great. Every major attraction is real close. One to ten blocks at most. The owner, Gassim, and his daughter Miriam make you feel like family. The same is true for the rest of the staff. The rooms are spacious and immaculate. We stayed 6 nights and will definitely stay here on our next visit to Florence. The daily Continental breakfast was very good and offered an adequate selection which included cereal, yougert, pastries, cheese and numerous coffee selections.In the afternoons the guests gather on their own to chat and sip wine in a second floor lounge area. It's an enjoyable way to meet other guests and rest after a day of walking through Florence and Tuscany.jean  roger, palm city florida

<Content>Fabulous gem of a hotel This lovely family-run hotel was the perfect spot from which to visit Florence. The father and daughter team were wonderful, very welcoming, and very sweet. Our room was downright huge with beautiful handpainted furniture and a large, clean bathroom.The hotel has original frescoed ceilings and is a perfect gem. The suite level where we stayed was super quiet. The location was fantastic, a few blocks from the duomo and right near everything you want to see. My husband and I were thrilled with this hotel (and I am very picky!) and the wonderful service from Gassim and his daughter. Definitely would stay here again!

<Content>Best Boutique Hotel - Beautiful Views  Hotel Europa is one of the best boutique family-run hotels I have stayed in across not only Italy, but Europe. This is the place to stay if you want a taste of Italian family culture where you will receive genuine warm hospitality.I stayed here twice in the busy month of June for a total of 6 nights. During my first stay, I stayed in a double room that had a little balcony decorated with plants and colourful flowers with a gorgeous view of the Duomo - in a nutshell, wow. The room was spacious, with a modern bathroom and spotless clean. As I was returning the following week with my husband, I asked for the same room and the owners were more than happy to oblige.I have stayed in a number of hotels across Europe ranging up to 5 stars and never have I had such a nice room with a beautiful view, perfectly located, away from the street noise AND accompanied by such warm, hospitable service...all for such a reasonable price! You would be silly to pass up Hotel Europa. It is perfectly located and provides a service that only a welcoming host family can provide. You will leave Florence with the feeling that you experienced its true culture after staying at Hotel Europa.

<Content>A little Gem, our home from home. We cannot recommend more highly the family-run Hotel Europa. Gassim, Maria and family make us feel so welcome every time we visit Florence (twice a year on business for the past few years) and go out of their way to give helpful advice, restaurant and train timetables etc. as well as valet parking your car. The Suite rooms are newly furnished and all the hotel rooms are exceptionally clean and have great beds. A little gem and great value.

<Content>An Amazing Hotel with Wonderful Hosts! My wife and I spent 3 days in Florence at the beginning of June and stayed in the Dante Suite. It was incredibly quiet, with two windows from the bedroom opening up onto a courtyard. The room was large with lots of room to move around in. The bathroom was recently upgraded and again, provided a generous amount of room. No need to worry about hot water or water pressure - there was ample! Ditto with the air conditioning when we needed it.The breakfast area was charming with a beautiful fresco on the ceiling. A highlight every morning for us was the coffee - self-served from an amazing espresso machine!The location can't be beat. The hotel is located in the heart of all the action. No need for taxis, you can walk everywhere you want/need to explore (wouldn't recommend renting a vehicle - there's no need unless you want to explore outside the city).I must say, however, that the highlight of our stay at Hotel Europa was the hospitality shown by Gassim and Miriam. They're absolutely delightful and really made us feel welcome. My wife and I strongly recommend this property. Its 2-star rating doesn't do it justice.

<Content>home away from home I recently visited Florence with a group of 14 friends and our stay in Florence was made much more comfortable due to our stay at Hotel Europa. Though we had moved from a 5 star to a 2 star we were treated with kindness and respect. Gassim and his daughter Miriam did their very best to accomodate our needs. Their breakfast room was a very comfortable meeting place for us and we met some other tourists who were also very pleasant an interesting. For the price and location and especially the warmth of our hosts, it is a bargain all the way around. Thanks to all.Caio!

<Content>Excellent service and location My family of four stayed at Hotel Europa for 3 nights recently based on reviews found in Trip Advisor. We were very pleased. When we arrived at the hotel after a long day of traveling, we were met at the door by Gassim who was gracious and watchful over our satisfaction for the entire stay. Our room was large, clean and comfortable (even for 4 people) and the location was right up the street from the Duomo. Even with its central location, the room was very quiet.My family and I really enjoyed the Europa Hotel and strong recommend it.

<Content>Excellent hotel - great location The hotel was recommended to us by a friend and we were extremely happy with their recommendation. We spent two weeks travelling around Italy and this was by far the nicest hotel we stayed in on our trip - and also the best value for money. The owners Gassim and Mirriam were extremely helpful and had no problem in extending our check-out time the next day. Our only regret was that we could only stay one night 鈥?will definitely be going back to this hotel and for longer next time!!

<Content>First Class Hotel!!! My wife and I stayed at Hotel Europa for 3 nites as part of a 1 month holiday through France and Italy. Our travel to the hotel involved a 14 hour train ride from Nice, France. Needless to say, we were cranky and tired upon arriving at Hotel Europa at 11pm at nite. This all changed as we were greeted by Gassim with his warm hospitality and complimentary large bottle of cold water.For 120 EUR/nite, we stayed in the spacious #40 (if my memory is correct) room, very clean, simple and away from street noise. It had a balcony facing the Duomo. It was air conditioned. Breakfast was simple with croissants, yogurt, cereal and a very good cappuccino/expresso/cafe machine. Gassim is constantly manning the food table to ensure enough food is available and is often seen cleaning and serving the hotel guests.The location of the hotel is ideal, 5 min walk to the Accademia, 10 walk to the Uffizi, the Tourist information booth is across the street and 2 minute walk to the outdoor market and indoor supermarket (definite highlight if you enjoy immersing in Italian culture).The beauty of this hotel is the first class hospitality of this family run hotel headed by father Gassim and his daughter Miriam. Both work tirelessly to ensure all guests were well taken care of. The hotel also provides free internet access.

<Content>A Fabulous Find We stayed seven nights in May at the Hotel Europa. Both Gassim and Miriam were gracious hosts as were all the staff and made the hotel feel like home. Our room overlooked a beautiful courtyard and was quite large compared to other hotels we have visited in Europe鈥揳nd quiet. The hotel is right in the center of the city and was within walking distance of all the major sites. They recommended Trattoria Za Za for dinner and it turned out to be one of our favorite places to eat. We would definitely give this hotel our highest recommendation and hope to return some day!

<Content>An excellent hotel This is the best hotel in Florence (I've stayed in most of the others in 30 years). Hundred or so yards from the center, close to San Marco, comfortable suite and, most generously, a birthday present from the owners.

<Content>solid value, great staff I just returned from a week at the Europa where I stayed while traveling alone on business. This is a very well-run, comfortable two star hotel in a prime location. Your experience of the room will vary according to where you stay; at first I was in a single room that fronted on Via Cavour which while entirely functional, large enough and very clean, was a little dark and even the triple glazed windows could not entirely block the sounds of the buses blasting down the street in the middle of the night. Oddly, in the general hustle and bustle of the day you don't really notice the sounds. I mentioned the problem the next morning and they very gratiously moved me to an interior triple. That was an excellent room, totally quiet, large, light, and it opened out on a charming courtyard behind which loomed the tower of the Duomo. Hard to beat that. I should probably say that it looks to me like most of the hotel rooms are actually back off the street. Breakfasts were a mix of fresh and packaged rolls, yogurt, cheese, jam, cereals, juices, and the excellent expresso/capaccino. The desk help was always friendly, always helpful. The resturant tip from them was the best restuarant I ate at in Florence. One hint regarding the internet. Someone (not the hotel) was running an open WIFI network that you could hit from the desk where the shared computer sits.

<Content>Wonderful hosts! My wife, son, daughter-in-law and I stayed four nights. It is ideally located, walking distance to the Duomo, the city center, etc. We were especially pleased with our hotel hosts; they were very helpful and Gassim especially made our stay such a pleasure. Not only was he helpful with directions, getting tickets, information about restaurants, etc, but also his friendliness really was a pleasure. He is a gem! We look forward to staying there again.

<Content>Fabulous Find Intially, we had our reservations on the first Saturday we were in Florence. Our room was a huge 2 room suite (160 Euro per), with painted frescos on the ceilings, but malfunctioning air conditioners made sleeping impossible. The father (of the family owners) couldn't move us to a room that night, but said a technician would come to fix it on Monday. (admittedly, at first, we had trouble convincing him there was anything wrong with the air conditioner). The next day, Mirriam (the daughter) overheard my husband in the hallway suggesting we ask for another room. She immediately took action, came running down the stairs, and moved us to another room (Michaelangelo, #34). Though the room was much smaller, it was bright, cheerful, great air conditioning, and had windows that opened up onto quiet private rooftops and its own personal refrigerator. The next morning, Mirriam's father showed me how to use the cappuccino maker and was going to wait on me (even though it was a self-serve breakfast). Mirriam compensated us by charging 140 Euro per night, and when we left she gave us a bottle of chardonnay as a parting gift for our troubles. If you have an issue at Hotel Europa talk to Mirriam. She is effective and incredibly gracious. Note: If you have laundry done or buy water, it is expected that you pay cash up front, they keep their hotel room costs seperate from these sundries. Hair dryer in bathrooms.My husband and I have traveled to quite a few different countries and we find that people are as nice to you as you are to them. This is one experience that went from poor to terrific and we'd be happy to stay with them again.

<Content>Unpleasant surprise after all these reviews Location is A+. The entrance with the tiny elevator did not look too attractive. The fromt desk area and the dining room are rather worn out. But when I entered the room, I was shocked: peeling off paint, broken shower, no window treatments of any sort. When I mentioned the huge discrepancy with the photographs on the web, I was shown the room that was pictured, to prove that it did exist, but it was occupied. After some hot negotiation both parties in our group were upgraded to suites for no additional charge, but with no smile or acceptance of wrongdoing on the side of the staff either. Breakfast was rather weak, compared with others we had in Italy (second worst in our 5 hotel experience). At departure, we were presented with the charge for the parking - time and a half of what was quoted initially. Again, after we expressed some unhappiness, fornt desk person paid the difference himself. So, even though all our problems eneded up being resolved, the bitter aftertaste remained.

<Content>Great staff and charming room Just got back from Italy, stayed 2 nights at Hotel Europa. very friendly and helpful staff, we had no need to go to the tourist info office across the street. Were upgraded to an available suite, the Leonardo, at no extra charge - this room was enormous compared to our 3-star hotel in Rome, also had large bathroom with full tub. Staff recommended Trattoria ZaZa and it was fabulous, we became regulars there during our stay. Not sure why this hotel only gets 2 stars, we would rank it higher - felt very at home here and really enjoyed it.

<Content>Friendly, charming, elegant I'd just sprained my ankle when I arrived, a refugee from a rather grotty hotel and Miriam and Gassim managed to put myself and my husband up at short notice (and were incredibly hospitable and attentive, offering me a seat and a complimentary drink in the heat). The first night we stayed in a standard room, which is just that, but it was clean and although the road was noisy at the front, it wasn't when the windows were closed. The second and third nights, they managed to accommodate us in the suites, which are fabulous, elegantly furnished and very quiet, and made me feel like a princess. The whole family made us extremely welcome, particularly as it was my husband's birthday. All this at a very reasonable rate in comparison to other hotels. Thanks for everything!

<Content>Quality Accommodation and Service We have just returned from spending 2 nights in the Hotel Europa Suites in Florence and had a wonderful time. When we arrived the hotel's computer system had malfunctioned and there was a problem with the number of rooms required. However, after we returned from lunch the situation was resolved, three beautiful suite rooms as reserved.The family could not have been more helpful. The hotel was so peaceful it was difficult to believe that you were staying in the city centre.Perfect location, perfect accommodation and service.Thank you Gassim and co. We will return again soon.

<Content>Great Hotel for Relatively Small Price If you are travelling to Florence, make the Hotel Europa part of your journey. It's in a great location, very near to the museums you will want to visit. The rooms and common areas were very very clean and tastefully done. The hosts speak excellent English and were as friendly as family. They even have a workstation you can use for free to access the internet. Really, I can't say enough good things about the place. I'm sure if you spent 5 or 6 times the money, you'll find a more posh space. But this hotel would be a bargain at twice the price.

<Content>Charming 2 star hotel We stayed at the Europa in early May for 4 nights and were delighted. We usually book 3 stars or better but I had read a very positive review of the Europa in the NY Times from a couple of years ago so we decided to try it.Our first room was on the main floor at 100E/night in high season for a double, which includes their cold breakfast with lots of choices. It was bare, small and neat but it had all the usual accoutrements of higher-level hotels. The hotel is about 3 blocks from the Duomo in one direction and two blocks from the Accademia in the other. Our room was facing the street and noise at night got to be a bit much so we switched to one of the suites on the lower floor (130E/night) and were very happy with it. Our room faced onto a quiet courtyard (some have views of the Duomo) and was about twice the size of the first room.I highly recommend the Europa. The staff is charming and helpful, plus there's a computer for the use of guests at no charge! Someone else said they were pushy about where you could sit for breakfast but we didn't encounter this ... perhaps the hotel was more crowded at that time.If you are looking for de luxe accommodations this won't be the place for you. But if you want a reasonably priced, neat and clean hotel -- try the Europa.

<Content>Amazing Florence We spent a week in Florence at the end of April 2005 and stayed at the Hotel Europa. The staff were really friendly, kind and helpful and made us feel really welcome. We asked for a room with a view and got a lovely balcony filled with exotic plants and flowers - with a great view of the Duomo and Giotto's bell tower. The hotel is clean and comfortable and in a great location just a few minutes walk from the Duomo, the Baptistery, San Lorenzo Church and many other wonderful sights. We would definitely go back.

<Content>Excellent hotel great staff and value An affordable hotel very centrally located with an exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. The hotel run by a sweet family was clean and bright. The proprieters took pride in their business and were willing to provide for any requests. There were no hidden costs or unpleasant surprises. When checking in they offered us a tour of the rooms they had available and let us choose the one we wanted. After checking out they took care of our bags for hours while we roamed the city and then when we finally left they gave us a bottle of chianti! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was looking for a comforatble centrally located spot.

<Content>Relax and comfortable stay! We stayed in Florence just for one night, but the stay in Hotel Europe made the short stay very comfortable and memorable.First of all, I do appreciate their quick responce to my inquiry through the internet. I asked them the availability of the rooms quite last minutes, but they answered my question and request perfectly in pleasant manner.We stayed in suite rooms, which was pretty, clean and comfortable.My friend is really particular about the cleanness in the bathroom, but she was quite satisfied with that.The most impressive part of this hotel is the peple working there.We received excellent service from them, especially from the owner.He seemed very happy with what he did, and which made me feel relax and comfortable staying with them.As I also work in sevice industry, I learned a lot of thing from him- friendly but not to over friendly.The location of the hotel is also good.I do recommened the people going Florence to stay with them!Thank you!

<Content>Great for families! Hi,Just got back from a trip to Rome and Florence, include a stay at the Hotel Europa. Our family of 4, including two kids ages 4 and 6, were travelling with my husband's parents. We were all very pleased, and both Gassim and Miriam were very pleasant and hospitable. For example, they helped us find a driver to tour Tuscany, and rearranged tables in the breakfast room so we could all sit together. We had two rooms (the upgraded ones that I believe they call suites), including a quadruple that was amazingly spacious. The kids each had their own bed, which they loved. When planning the trip, I discovered that quadruple rooms were very hard to come by, and was told that it was against the law in Italy to book 4 people into a triple room, even if two of them are kids. So, the positives of Hotel Europa are:- lots of space- able to accomodate a family of 4- central location; even the kids didn't mind walking to the Pitti Palace, which is one the other side of the Arno- wonderful hosts- breakfast included (yogurt, cereal, bread, coffee, etc.)- clean, quiet rooms with spacious bathsIf you are looking for a luxury hotel with a bellhop, tapestries on the walls, and dinner to piano music, this is not the place. If you are looking for a simple but clean rooms that are a good value for Florence, this will suit you well.

<Content>Decent hotel/Safe for most tourists, even picky ones We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Our room was very small but it was clean and somewhat updated compared to other hotels in Italy. The staff were helpfu and nice. The rooms seemed to be fairly insulated and you couldn't hear your neighbors or outside traffic very much.This hotel is very conveinently located right outside the train station and is only about a 10-15 ride into Florence. They also have a reasonably priced bar in the lobby and another one directly across the street. They do have a restaurant and a neat breakfast lounge in the top floor. The staff were a little pushy about where you could sit in the morning at breakfast but that was really our only complaint.This is a decent hotel and would be safe for the average tourist.

<Content>My Dream Hotel Have you ever had a day when the stress of travel gets you down and you just want to escape to a quiet, secluded place away from clamoring tourists? The Hotel Europa is perfect! Not more than 5 minutes from the Piazza del Duomo, you can be in a small, very clean, quiet room (maybe with a view of the dome of the Duomo and the Campanile as mine had) far from the madding crowds. You take the elevator to the 3rd floor (2 piano), ring the doorbell and instantly feel welcome and safe in the care of the your friendly Ethiopian family owners. Travel directions and restaurant suggestions are available if wanted and you're free to use their computer (without charge) for your e-mail. All rooms have ensuite bathrooms and small televisions. For the single woman traveller or anyone who's looking for an economical, clean, quiet room, I can't recommend the Hotel Europa and their kind owners more highly. The New York Times agreed with me. Several years ago The Frugal Traveller was also seduced by its charms.

<Content>Wonderful experience Everything about our stay was wonderful. The room was clean and spacious. The breakfast was great (the cappuccino maker is out of Harry Potter!). The family which own and manage the hotel (for 30-some years) was extremely gracious. They would do anything for you...I would go back to stay here in a heartbeat. And the prices were very reasonable.

<Content>Hotel Europa is very convenient in Florence, Italy If you are traveling to Florence, Italy, check out Hotel Europa. It is very conveniently located. Take the taxi from the airport. Do not rent a car. You don't need one in Florence. If you need a car to go to Tuscany, go back to the airport (15 minute taxi) and rent one. The rooms in the suite floor are newly renovated. A bit small like other hotels in Europe but quite nice. The staff is great. Local restaurants that were recomended by the staff included Za Za.. We ate both lunch and dinner there. Inside and outside. Make a reservation for dinner; arrive early for a great table outside for lunch. Tuscano was recommended for dinner. Very nice; casual. Go for it. I would stay at Europa during my next trip because of the location and the rooms. I hope to return soon.

<Content>BEWARE! Hotel cancelled my booking and charged my credit card We booked this hotel for our November 2004 trip to Italy. I made the reservations through the Florenceby website, which is the link provided by the Hotel Europa. You have to provide your credit card information in order to confirm your reservation. I made this reservation and was confirmed back in August of 2004. Literally 24 hours before we were to leave the States for our Italy trip, I received an email from HotelEuropa explaining that they were sorry but had to cancel our reservation and hope to accomadate us in the future. I am a planner and was in a panic attack to find another hotel 24 HOURS before we left for our trip!! Luckily, I was able to find another hotel that had two rooms available (we booked two suites at hotel europa). Imagine my surprise on our return home to the U.S. when I received my creidt card statement in Dec. 2004 and had been charged one nights stay for two rooms at the hotel Europa = $300.00+ US dollars!!! When they had cancelled our reservation!! I immediately sent out emails to the hotel and received replies from MIRIAM at the hotel. Through a number of emails, I was able to finally explain to her what had happened and that the HOTEL cancelled my reservation NOT me. What Miriam admitted to, was that one of their employees had sent me the email AND charged my card. She explained that this employee was no longer with them. She asked for me to send her my credit card info to them again and they would credit my card for the charges. She also admitted in her email that the responsibility was on them and they would reverse the charges. After waiting another week, I still had not received credit on my card, so I sent another email to Miriam. I sent several more emails with no response. I then received an email back from an ERIC who is with WORLDBY - somehow in connection with the booking service FLORENCEBY. Eric said in his email that it was ME who was responsible for the charges and should be grateful I wasn't charged for the entire booking (which was 2 suites for 3 nights), rather I was only charged for one nights stay. I immediately sent Eric another email giving him documentation of previous conversations via email w/Miriam from the Hotel Europa in which she admitted guilt and responsibliltiy on behalf of the hotel.Eric then sent me another email and said he had spoken on the phone with the hotel and they admitted to him that they needed to refund me the money and would be issuing a credit through their bank's Visa contact. I sent emails to Eric thanking him for his help and waited for my credit. After checking every few days and waiting, I began to send Eric more emails asking why my credit hadn't posted to my account yet. Basically after 3 months of back and forth communication, in his last email, Eric said he didn't know how long it would take for me to get my credit and there wasn't anything else he could do. So as of today, April 29, 2005, I still have NOT received my credit back, nor have a received a response from Hotel Europa since Eric from WORLDBY began communicating with me on their behalf. As stated above, I have paper documentation showing the cancellation email sent by the hotel, emails received by Miriam in which she admits Hotel Europa made a mistake and would credit my card, and email documentation of my conversations w/Eric from Worldby. So I say all this as a WARNING to those booking in advance with Hotel Europa. I would be very careful in giving out your credit card information. As for the hotel itself, I'm sure it is lovely and I would have liked the opportunity to stay there, but cannot give a review on that since my reservation was cancelled! Please feel free to email me directly if you should have any questions regarding this posting. Regards,Wendy

<Content>Awesome Stay I stayed here w/my girlfriends the summer of 2004. The rooms are clean, roomy and nicely decorated and the location could not be better. The four of us felt safe walking to/from the hotel at night etc. Gaseem (the owner) was so friendly and helpful. I like it so much that we are returning this summer. I've traveled in Europe a lot and b/c of Gaseem's kind service along with the cleanliness of the rooms/location/appearance; it's one of my favorite stays to date!

<Content>Good value Our family of 4 stayed here 3 nights in April. The room was a quad suite, which was in the back so no view. But it was by far the largest room we had in two weeks in Italy, and the only one with a bathtub. The room was furnished very nicely (everything new and matching, but with an antique look), complete with a small fridge and desk, and everything was very clean. The breakfast was fine, there is free internet in the lobby, and the front desk staff was very helpful and nice. Being just a few blocks north of the Duomo and about a block south of the Accademia, the location was pretty good, we walked everywhere with no problem (including up past Piazza Michelangelo). I just wish the hotel wasn't on such a busy street. However, the price was excellent for a quad., just 180 euros per night (considerably less than most places I was looking at). We'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent value We recently stayed at the Hotel Europa in Florence and it was an excellent experience. The facilities were great and the serivce provided was some of the best we encountered. It was close to everything and proved to be a top value for any tourist. We were lucky enough to get a large room that was on the quiet side of the building.

<Content>Excellent hospitality Our large group discovered the Europa via Trip Advisor, and all the previous positive reviews are spot on. The Europa doesn't seem to appear in any guidebooks, and the entrance lobby downstairs is unpromising, but once you arrive in the hotel, Gassim and his daughter Miriam are wonderfully discreetly attentive hosts. The rooms at the back are quiet and elegantly furnished, and the hotel is perfectly placed - a couple of minutes' walk from the Duomo. Our group of 13 stayed for a week, and felt we really had found a home from home.

<Content>Extreamly hospitable The atmosphere is lovely. Decorated in French Provincial. The bathroom is clean with a great shower and a towel warmer too. The staff is extreamly hospitable and helpful. We only stayed one night but had a wonderful experience and beautiful breakfast.

<Content>The Europa was an Excellent base in Florence The Europa was clean, well run and handily situated. The service provided by the proprietor and his daughter was outstanding, in an unpretentious way. We stayed in the normal rooms, and mine was small but very adequate, and reasonably priced compared with other hotels in Florence. The suites on the floor below are luxurious (but presumably a lot more expensive!). Breakfast is a simple continental affair, but the coffee machine made some of the best coffee I have come across. If you want somewhere in Florence which is simple but comfortable, and which is good value then I thoroughly recommend the Europa.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Europa with our three kids. What makes the Hotel great is the service and warmth of this family run operaton. The hotel is very central and within walking distance of everything, including the train station. We would easily make the choice to stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful blend of history and comfort This beautiful hotel in the center of florence has 16th century frescoes on the ceilings, luxurious furnishings and great views. It also has been upgraded with modern fixtures and bathrooms. The showers have massage heads. There are built in hair dryers and towel warmers, new ceramic tile floors and lots of space. The hand painted desk in the room hides a refridgerator where we kept drinks and snacks. The large breakfast room has a machine that grinds the beans then makes wonderful espresso, capuccino, cafe au lait or steamed milk. there is also free internet access for guests. The owners of 30 years, Quassim and Maria, go out of their way to make your stay relaxing and comfortable. The location couldn't be better, with good places to eat and shop all around. A great value.

<Content>Hotel Europa is great! We recently stayed at the Hotel Europa in Florence. It has a great location - only a couple of blocks from the Duomo. We had a large room with a king-sized bed and a twin. Everything was quite comfortable. The only downside was the small shower, but that was more than made up for by the gorgeous view of the Duomo and Giotto's bell tower from our window. The staff (most of whom speak English) are extremely courteous and helpful, and breakfast was included in our room rate. They have a very nice cappuchino machine, and guests have an assortment of rolls and cereals to choose from. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Loved the ambiance of the Hotel Europa We spent three nights in February, 2005 at the Hotel Europa in Florence Italy and found the hotel to be an excellent place to stay while in Florence.The owners do everything possible to make your stay a good one. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of all the major attractions in Florence. The owners will make reservations for you too see David by Michaleangelo and the Uffizi Galery.The rooms are spacious, quiet and well-appointed. The staff is very friendly, which follows the owner's attitude to ensure the guests are comfortable. The morning breakfast is good.The hotel itself is a very interesting architecture site as the building is 300 years old and once was a monastery. The dining room has one of the original ceiling frescoes, which is nice to see in the morning.My family and I whole heartedly recommend the hotel.

<Content>A great place to stay in Florence!! In February, 2005 I stayed at Hotel Europa for 5 nights. What a great place to call home in Florence!! The location is central to all the major sights, good restaurants and, of course, fantastic shopping. I walked to most every major sight on the north side of the Arno, but if the bus is needed, Piazza San Marco is one block away, with all bus lines converging there.  The hotel has been recently updated and is clean and well-kept and attractive. From my room I could see the Duomo and the frescoe on the ceiling was 700 years old. It was charming and quiet. (I recommend asking for a room away from Via Cavour, as the major street can be noisy at night.) Being a single lady traveler, I look for hotels that are clean, safe and reasonably priced. Hotel Europa is much more than that and exceeded my expectations in every way. I feel it's a real bargain. The owners were so friendly and made me feel at home by greeting me by name each time I appeared. During my stay I used the free internet service frequently to plan my further travels and Gassim, the manager, was helpful with suggestions and advice when asked. He's a real gem.I would highly recommend Hotel Europa in Florence and would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Hotel Europa Serves We were very pleased with our room and service at Hotel Europa. While the accommodations were not US style, (i.e. a smaller TV, small shower), the room was kept cleaner than most US hotels, the kingsize bed had an excellent mattress (there was also a twin bed in the room), and the room was extremely quiet. It is well located, just blocks from the Duomo and the train station. We were able to walk everywhere (except to our daughter's campus, which is on the outskirts of town).The continental breakfast was mediocre, with cereal, prepackaged bread, and orange juice. No fruit offered. The coffee was excellent, with several coffee options available.The staff was very friendly and helpful. We would definitely go back.

<Content>Room nice, but hotel owner a bit uptight We stayed at the Hotel Europa for three nights in August 2004 during our 10-day tour around Italy. We booked a triple and received a large room (for europe) with a double bed and a twin. The room was comfortable and bathroom facilities were decent. The A/C worked well which was great since August can be very hot in central Italy. The hotel location was good - a couple blocks from Galleria dell'Academia one direction and a couple blocks from the Duomo the other direction. It was also within walking distance of the train station.Our only real complaint was the hotel owner... he is from Nigeria and has run the hotel for many years (we learned from visiting with him). However, he always seemed to be slightly suspicious or at least a bit uptight. For instance, when we bought a bottle of water from other hotels, they would charge it to the room. Here, the owner wanted cash in hand right then. He also made us pay the bill for three nights after the second night. Perhaps he had people skip out after the last night stay without paying or something. We didn't care but it seemed that he was just a bit uptight and not overly trusting of people. The breakfast was ok but not near as good as we had in Rome or in Venice.Our stay at the Hotel Europa was good but we'd probably find a different place if we return to Florence in the future.
