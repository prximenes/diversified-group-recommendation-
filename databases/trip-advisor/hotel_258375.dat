<Content>What a location!!!! From the experience of our friends, we knew that it's bloody hard to find a good hotel in Florence, even if you pay a lot. We trusted the recommendation of our travel agent who used to stay there. I must admit it was not so easy to spot the hotel (we walked from central railway station) - try to find by the address, the hotel is not obvious.We knew the hotel was supposed to be located in the center, but we didn't expect the location would be so great. I don't think it can get any better! So for me - the location, the room - totally worth it and the other things (small hotel, tiny breakfast) did not matter so much. The staff spoke very reasonable English, that does matter when you don't stay at international hotel chains and travel in Italy :)We took a day trip to Siena by train - I would suggest to get out there as early as possible. Brilliant medieval town. We took a trip to Pisa in the evening - also great, but half a day is probably enough. :)

<Content>More dressed-up penzione than four star... I suspect it's only in Italy that a hotel like the Strozzi Palace could get a 4-star rating. The entrance, which is on the first floor, looks unkempt and tatty. The so-called 'buffet breakfast' is an example of minimum effort -no toast, no fresh fruit, no muesli. On the plus side, our bedroom was large and totally insulated from street noise (we heard other guests complaining about being kept awake by the lift so it's probably a good idea to ask for a street-facing bedroom). The bathroom had a shower cubicle with a just-ok shower, and the twin beds were comfortable but small, while the bedroom carpet had seen better days. The location can't be faulted -very central, near to the station, the Duomo and all the designer stores on Via Tornabuoni. Just don't go to the Strozzi Palace (Palace!!) expecting any luxury because there is none to be had. We paid 105 euros a night with breakfast, and it certainly isn't worth any more than that.

<Content>Great Hotel Recently, while on a holiday with my wife and 2 teenage daughters, I had a chance to stay at Hotel Strozzi Palace in Florence. It was great hotel. Right from my entry to the hotel, we were treated as someone special. The lady at reception was very polite, smiling and helped us in all ways. She guided us about the attractions, trains station and schedules, eating places in florence etc. etc. The room was also great and above all the location was very central. The only nagative thing about the hotel was that the reception was on level 2 and you had to climb a flight of stairs to reach there, which is very cumbersome if your are carrying luggage. Otherwise and excellent place to stay.

<Content>very large bedrooms we have just returned from a 4 day stay at this hotel with our 2 children, aged 10 and 7 years. the hotel is well situated near to the main sites. the rooms were clean and larger than average, capable of accomodating a double bed and two singles without difficulty. the breakfasts were good and the staff were accomodating. All in all we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would stay again, were we to return to Florence in the future.having read previous reviews we had been concerned that noise would pose a problem. fortunately, however, we did not find this to be the case and had no difficulties sleeping.

<Content>Bed Buds!! July 1- 4, 2007We arrived in the afternoon and was happy that the roomwas being air conditioned. Immediately we took off toexplore the city and were very happy with the location ofthe Strozzi. That night while asleep we felt bugs crawling onus and just kept on sleeping. In the morning we realized that we were literally being eaten. There were dark dried spots ofblood on the sheets and cover. It was very hard to explain there were bugs in our bed in italian, the translations just weren't working. So we went back to our room and collectedthe bugs in a ziplock and my husband went to the front deskto show them and then squeezed one of the bugs which responded in exploding blood all over the bag. They immediately moved us to another room, which I think i continuedto be eaten, but couldn't actually see the bugs. Hence, the biteswere small and itchy, a few days later i was covered in bug bites which itched like the chicken pox and then had an allergic reaction. Swelling, increased itching. We have been back from the Strozzi for a few weeks and I am still covered in bites that are taking forever to heal. Not to mention the creepiness of it all. The strozzi was clean and other than this huge problem it was fine.

<Content>watch for bugs Great location to explore Florence but we were eaten alive by bedbugs in room 21 on July 1 and 2 this year. Had to catch some in a baggie after the second morning waking up to find them in our bed to convince management they were in our room before getting assigned to a different room. Bites did not really begin to show up until 2 days later then looked like we had stumbled into poison ivy or something with severe rash like reaction and little blisters everywhere we were bitten (literally hundreds of blister spots on arms, legs, neck). Now two weeks later and still haven't gone completely away. You don't feel them like a mosquito when biting, just days later when they begin to itch. Hopefully they got rid of those beds in room 21.

<Content>Great Location One word of advice - if they offer you the Michaelangelo or Raffaelo room, say no. The Michaelangelo room was in the attic and reminded me of a bad student apartment. We spent two days in the room before they moved us. It was a two star room in a four star hotel.The room they moved us to was beautiful. If we had of been in that room the entire stay it would have been great.The location is perfect - everything in Florence is just a short walk away.

<Content>Outdated Pictures The Strozzi Palace Hotel was a disappointment. The outdated pictures online and on their own hotel brochure do not depict the Asian restaurant that is located on the ground floor of the building(it is located where the white awnings are in the lower right side of the photos-the honky-tonk purple neon Chinese Restaurant signs are not depicted anywhere in their literature or online-very misleading). The cooking smells from the restaurant greeted you upon first entering the hotel and they also permeated the lower floors of the hotel. The smells were so powerful that they made the thought of enjoying the hotel's complimentary breakfast in the lobby/dining area unbearable. The lobby was outdated and in desperate need of a cleaning, although the rooms and location were acceptable. I would not stay here again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.

<Content>great location This hotel is in a great location. It was recommended to us by family who stayed in September 06. We had a family room which was very big and spacious for two adults and a 5 and 7 year old, it was clean and the bathroom was very big and also very clean. The family rooms face onto the street, which can be noisy, but afterall you are in Florence, so just enjoy! The staff were helpful enough, and the breakfast buffet was basic but satisfying. We would stay here again. The Chinese restaurant next door to the hotel served one of the nicest Chinese meals we've had in a very long time...and it was so reasonably priced.

<Content>A Very Pleasant Surprise We stayed at the Strozzi Palace from April 27 to 29. It was at the end of our family trip to Italy, and it perfect for us.I booked the Strozzi based largely on reviews posted on TripAdvisor. Even though most of the reviews were positive, I was a little concerned by some of the negative ones. However, the deciding factor for me was that the hotel offered a family size room where the four of us could sleep in one room.We drove to Florence from a villa we were staying at in Tuscany. It took us an hour to figure out where the rental car office was located because there was a lot of road construction going on and key roads were blocked. After a lot of frustration returning our car, we took a taxi for the short ride to the Strozzi. The first impression of the hotel is not good; as mentioned in other reviews, the entrance is narrow and dark, and you have to climb a short flight of stairs to get to a very small elevator. Once you take this to the first floor, where reception is location, you are greeted by a very unimpressive looking lobby. So after a long and tiring day, I was a little apprehensive about the hotel.However, our fears were banished once we got off the elevators to the floor where our room was located. Oddly, everything above the lobby level is wide open and newly renovated. Our room was absolutely gorgeous -- huge, with high ceilings, nice decorations, very large windows opening up to the street, and a spacious, newly renovated bathroom. We let out a sigh of relief and took a much-needed rest before heading out to see Florence that night.Besides the rooms, the big appeal of this hotel is the location. It is situated right in the middle of historical Florence; every major sight, the Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio bridge, the Duomo, is pretty much a quick walk away. We only had two days to experience Florence, so the location was perfect for us. The downside is that our room was a little noisy at night, but that could only be expected. The other aspect we loved about the hotel was the very helpful staff. They made dinner reservations, told us where the best place to get gelato was, and tried to make ticket reservations for us at the Uffizi (unfortunately, it was impossible since we only told them a day in advance). The hotel also thoughtfully sent a bottle of wine to our room since it was my wife's birthday. The breakfast at the hotel was adequate.Overall, we would recommend this hotel highly to anyone looking for a clean, safe, centrally-located hotel in Florence. If this hotel would invest in renovating it's entrance, lobby and common areas, it would really be a homerun.

<Content>Some Good and Some Bad for Families We are two adults and two children. This is a fine European-style hotel in an absolutely superb location. It was clean and roomy and the breakfasts were fine.The downsides were that it was incredibly noisy (basic street noise right outside the window) and the pull out bed for the kids was a killer. It was missing slats and I think my daughter's back still hurts. If they were to fix the kid's bed I would probably upgrade this to a 4.

<Content>Average for a Four Star Hotel I stayed with my family in this hotel - four of us in a suite. The extra bed was a pull out couch and painfully uncomfortable. Even when my sister sat on it, one of the wooden beems fell out. The room looked nice upon entering, but the carpet was very dirty, and they never vacumed it while we were there. After our first night, they never put back on the beds the bed spreads. I believe this is so they have to clean them less. That left me with the feeling that they were being cheep. The bathroom was very big and clean. The breakfast was not great, even for Italian standards. The location was perfect. Just a few blocks from some of the main attractions. They had fantastic free high-speed internet acess which was helpful for my job, but also for looking at train schedules, etc. (I had a lap top with me). The staff were very friendly, but be careful of their recommendations on where to eat dinner. We took their recommendation, and it was a complete turist trap and over priced. And the waiter made it a point to explain that I should be sure to leave a tip - I live in Italy, and know that there is no tiping! I was absolutely shocked that he would have the nerve to tell me to leave a tip (by the way - the name of the restaurant was Bucca Mario). For the price and location, I would stay here again. I am not sure it is a top four star hotel, but it is a step above a three start hotel.

<Content>Brilliant location This hotel is excellent for historical attractions as you are in the centre of everything. The hotel is clean and tidy, however the reception is on the 1st floor. A lift is provided, but very small, only sufficient space for one adult wih large suitcase. Rooms are clean, tidy and spacious. Breakfast is quick and simple , continental style. Reception staff helpful and will book in advance for Uffizi.

<Content>Excellent location but noisy Strozzi Palace Florence Italy.2nd of July 06.Trip advisor member . Melbourne Australia.We just got back from our trip around Europe. This is our third time in Florence. We stayed at the Strozzi palace hotel because it can accomodate four people in the one room. The rooms were very big and comfortable. Very big bathrooms and very clean. I have no problem with the room, but the noise from the street was unbearable. When we were there the building next door to the hotel was being reconstructed so if you like to sleep in on your holidays forget it. The hotel is in a side street but the buses and vespas run in the street all day. No insulation or double glazing on the windows. The aircondition was fine, the breakfast is very limited but sufficient. The location is super as it is close to everything. You can walk to the hotel from the main train station and to all the shopping streets, that is the best feature of the hotel. I have been to Europe a few times and we always stay in 4 stars hotels. I will not stay at this hotel again because of its noise.

<Content>Location location location After an initial niggle, when they wanted to bump us to another hotel, we enjoyed out stay. It was perfectly situated in a side street just round the corner from the Duomo, and the Piazza della Repubblica. The room was a good size, and the bathroom excellent. The breakfasts were unexciting compared to some other hotels, but OK for quantity and quality. If the staff could learn to smile more, it would make you feel more welcome.

<Content>One of the best hotels I've stayed in My mom and I stayed at the Strozzi Palace for five nights and loved this hotel. We were on the fifth floor, and while the elevator does not go up there nor to street level, the staff was extremely helpful with our luggage. Overall, the staff was wonderful. The people at the front desk recommended excellent restaurants and set us up with tours and train schedules.Our room was very nice too. It may not have had a view, but as it was December and snowing, we didn't have the window open much anyway! The room had 2 large wardrobes with a safe, a mini-fridge, and a very large bathroom. Everything was cleaned within a matter of hours after we left to explore Florence.The location is also amazing...very easy to access anything in the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Florence.

<Content>Strozzi Palace -- Fabulous in Florence! I have had the pleasure of staying at the Strozzi Palace Hotel twice, once in 2003 and again in 2005, both during the summer. Both times the staff was welcoming, the service excellent and the rooms elegant,large, comfortable and modern. By far it is the nicest hotel I have stayed at in Italy.As some have pointed out, there is a flight of stairs which you need to climb to reach reception and the elevator, which is small [holds 2 adults w/suitcases]. Persons with physical disabilities or those who pack large, heavy suitcases might want to consider another location. This is, after all, Europe, where the buildings are old and hotels are retro-fitted [which also might mean a room without a view]. But, as someone who has traveled extensively in Europe and the U.S., the old buildings are the beauty and charm of Europe. For those Americans that have not traveled to Europe before, here are a couple of things that will help you set your expectations:* Believe it or not, air conditioning is NOT turned on in Italian hotels until May, so if you go in April and it's hot, you are out of luck regardless of where you stay. It is a matter of energy conservation, something important to Europeans. Also, air conditioning in Europe is not like in the U.S. -- you probably won't get the room down to 60 degrees. * A 4-star hotel in Europe is not like a 4-star hotel in the U.S. My experience has been that if you want the equivilent of a 4-star American hotel you'll need a 5-Star European hotel.* Old buildings will most likely have very small elevators. Expect it. And, taking the stairs is a way to burn off a few more calories after eating all that delicious Italian food! How do you think Italians stay so thin?!* If you want a hotel that is exactly like American hotels, then stay in an American hotel. Even then they probably won't be as large and have the same ammenities. I think this hotel is FABULOUS and that most guests will be very pleased with the accomodations. Try it -- you'll like it!

<Content>The best room we had in Italy I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat and would strongly recommend it to anyone visiting Florence. My wife and I just got back from a two-week trip to Italy with our two college-age students. The Strozzi Palace Hotel was by far the best room in our stay. Yes there are multiple flights of stairs--but there is an elevator for luggage. The high points of this hotel far outway any hassles of stairs. Let's start with our room--15 foot ceilings, two large windows giving out onto the street, plenty of room even with beds for four, bright, airy, pretty, and a spacious and modern bathroom. This was the largest, cleanest, nicest, and overall best room of the 4 hotels we visited in Italy. Then there's location, location, location. Three blocks from the Duomo. Two blocks from the Piazza di Indipendenza. Walking distance to all the sights in the middle of town. We walked to the train station for several day trips into Tuscany. The desk staff was helpful in suggesting restaurants and in making reservations for museum visits and a bus trip to Sienna and San Gimignano. Only room for improvement might be in the breakfast offering and the room's tiny TV--but we weren't in Florence to spend time watching television.

<Content>Great location; above average hotel Let's get the negatives out of the way first. There is a long flight of stairs up to the reception area (second floor)from the front door. If carrying your own bags it can be quite daunting. There is a single chair lift like those found in many homes for disabled guests, but for the rest of us the stairs were the only alternative. Bring earplugs as the walls are thin and voices carry. Church bells seem to be ringing much of the time. Unless you are at the front, there are NO VIEWS from your room - just walls of other buildings. On the plus side the rooms are quite well outfitted. Furnishings were nice, there was a nice chandelier, and the bathroom was modern and everything worked. My own room was a single (about 10' X 10') with a nice bathroom - shower only but a nice one with showerhead and 8 jets). Since it is not considered summer in October the air conditioning is shut off, and opening room windows lets in a lot of outside noises. The breakfasts were quite good - cheese, cold meats, croissants, cereals, juices, yoghurts etc with your choice of coffees. The location was very close to central Florence and around the corner from the Duomo (Cathedral). The Uffizi Gallery, Ponte Vecchio, shops, restaurants are all short walks away. Staff was friendly and helpful and spoke quite good English.I stayed for 4 days and thoroughly enjoyed my hotel experience. I have no other Florence hotels to compare this one with, but if the few negatives are not offputting, it might be worth a try.

<Content>Convenient but noisy I agree with most reviews of this hotel. It's convenience is it's only saving grace. In the middle of everything. It is very noisy in summer though. We stayed in August for 3 nights and had a room at the front of the hotel. Although the road appears to be a quiet side street, it is the parking lot for about 100 scooters which was especially awful on the Saturday night. The late night revellers were revving up scooters contiuously from midnight until 3.30am. Who said that New York is a city that never sleeps ? Florence is noisier by far !! I didn't notice dirty carpets but we had a jacuzzi bath and the water jets were filthy. We only took showers.A truly beautiful city but I wish we had picked a better hotel.

<Content>Great Location We stayed here from July until August 2005. The stairs are a nightmare for two girls with large suitcases, you go up about 10 -12 steps and then have a tiny lift to go in until you get to the first floor where the reception is. Dont expect anyone to help with your bags. The best thing about this hotel is the location, we walked to every location within 10 minutes 15 tops. In relation to the breakfast if you have stayed in Italy before then you know what to expect, small rolls, hams, Boiled - cold eggs and some museli. it is ok but it is still at the top end of what you usually get for breakfast in Italy. the staff are really nice, on the first day they gave us a map and told us where all the locaitons were, which was helpful. they did recommend a restaurant but we found that the ones we found ourselves were better.the rooms are not clean and the carpet is very very dirty. had to wear our shoes the whole time, our feet actually looked black from the dirt. the rooms were not cleaned every morning or if they were we could not tell they were. the shower we had was big and worked well.You can hear everything, on the last two nights a family came with young children and you could hear the screaming for some of the night.This is not a four star hotel, you pay for the location not the hotel quality. if all you want is a great location and an average room then stay here. if you like clean hotels and quality then pay a little more and stay elsewhere. I would also recommend having a drink at Gilli's and La Poste has nice food.

<Content>Rennaissance heart of Florence Stayed here for six days end of October 2004. Comfortable rooms with high ceilings and chandeliers. Friendly and helpful staff. However, pale coloured carpet was stained though clean. Bathroom spotless.Breakfast OK but everything packaged, no cooked food. My wife and I enjoyed the hotel. Great for location and very quiet. The hotel is just around the corner from the Duomo and easy walking to the Uffizi gallery. We recommend the San Lorenzo market for bargain silk ties at only 5 euros each and pashminas at 7 euros. Overall we would stay here again because of its fabulous location.

<Content>Excellent location, nice size rooms and splendid experience. I would first like to say my trip included stays in Venice, Rome  Florence. Unlike some others (who expect the luxuries of America when traveling abroad) - I found this hotel excellent. Unfortunately, some of my fellow countrymen live in HOT states (TX, NM, AZ, NV) whereas they keep their room temperature in the low 60s as their AC is on 24/7. As a result, their expectations when traveling abroad are slightly unrealistic as I rarely turn on AC throughout the year unless it hits the 90s (and even than it has to be humid) nor is AC a huge requirement for Europeans. However, I run marathons to stay healthy/fit and others may not have the same natural cooling abilities. I will agree the hotel does not have a 24/7 bellhop outside and you WILL have to carry your bags up a SHORT 5-8 step staircase before you see the elevator - my suggestions pack lighter or spend the money and stay at a more expensive hotel. If you could lug bags from the car to the airport terminal than getting to the elevator at this hotel is more than reasonable.I stayed for five nights and the first night was in a large room with jacuzzi tub, shower, long countertop, and large bedroom. The biggest complaint my first night was on the 2nd floor there was an infant crying throughout the night and VERY noisy college age neighbors. So, my ability to have a full night of sleep was limited. Otherwise, I had no complaints as the hotel can't control its guest. I was moved to a smaller room on the first floor with only a shower (with jets) and smaller living space. There was some pollution from the street entering the bathroom but I didn't spend my entire vacation in the bathroom. I would suggest confirming the room type as I've seen other messages on this topic, the jaccuzi wasn't a big perk for me so I didn't mind.Breakfast was described previously and typical for Europe, the Internet access worked the first 3 days but unavailable the last two days and the front desk couldn't give a real solution (not a big deal). The front desk was helpful and assisted with local directions, and verified I had late room service.The location was EXCELLENT - within walking distance of the Termini but off the main street so you have quiet living and peaceful sleep. Within walking distance of ALL Florence sites and mueseums. Elevator is very small (maybe one person with bags) so the stairwell is the way to go. Do NOT drive in Florence but if you must use the parking garage and leave the car there - Florence is a walking city or bus. Additionally, there isn't much sound proof between rooms so you may/will hear loud guest on your floor. My room temperature control wasn't a factor as I used the heater the first night and turned it off/down the remainder of my stay. The room is serviced twice a day - mid-morning and evening. I would select this hotel again during future visits to Florence. One other note - my first room didn't have the problem but my second room did have a couple mosquitos or fruitflies in the bathroom area but I noticed them around many areas of Italy - so may not be controllable by the hotel (I don't know if I was the only one with this experience).I had the opportunity to visit two other hotels in Florence (friends) during my stay and was more impressed with the Strouzzi after each visit. I had a very reasonable rate (115E) which helped due to the devalue of the USD.

<Content>Thanks Strozzi Palace Our stay at the STROZZI PALACE was really unforgetteable. Spacious room, nice full breakfast, excellent location and a particular thanks to all the staff friendly and helpful. The day we were checking out a gypsy tried to steal our suitcase in front of the hotel while we were waiting for our taxi. Mr. Jianni, one of the hotel employee,run against the gypsy and took us back our luggage.Thanks Strozzi palace we will come back.

<Content>Great location, large pleasant room We are a family of four, 2 adults, and two pre-teens. We stayed at the Strozzi Palace Hotel over Thanksgiving in Florence. The room was very large, even with a King bed and two cots, and decorated quite nicely. Our room was on the fourth floor, front of the building. We had a large bathroom, with a bidet, toilet and tub (with a hand-held shower, which we are used to when travelling in Europe). We had a safe and a mini-bar. We didn't need AC, so it wasn't an issue. The hotel's location is excellent; it is close to everything. I found the staff to be pleasant and accomodating, overall, but they didn't go out of their way to be overly friendly (nor did we need them to). The breakfasts were fine, with hard boiled eggs, procuitto, peaches, cereals, croissants, cheeses, juice, coffee and even hot chocolate for our children. They left out sherry and port in the evenings. Our bill at check out was correct with no hidden surprises. I read the other reviews on the SPH and I do agree with the others on the four star rating: I might give the SPH a 2-3 star rating, but I had read about the place before we stayed there, so I was not dissappointed or surprised. We had a very pleasant experience overall at the Strozzi Palace, and we would stay there again, though probably not in the summer unless they take care of their AC problem the other reviewers mentioned.

<Content>agree with "do not stay here" This hotel claims to be a four star establishment when in reality I wouldn't give it two. A hint to future guests: if you have a problem, it is your problem the staff including Antonia and the manager Gianni Burchietti will treat you as an enemy if you dare complain about the service or your accomodations. They will lie to you and tell you the reason for no air conditioning is a law that does not exist forbidding it. They will not apologize or offer any remedy for you concerns. Save yourself the pain and get yourself a real four star hotel and stay at the Best Western down the street.

<Content>Ok but not great... We just got back and stayed 5 nights in one of the deluxe rooms which was quite large. The hotel's biggest plus is the location...we were close to everything. We also got a good price for 5 nights. However, it is not a 4 star hotel...3 stars is more like it. The restaurant recommendations and overall concierge services are weak. The breakfasts were sufficient. Our room had a tub only...with a handheld shower head and no curtain so the bathroom was very wet. Lastly, the carpet in our room was really dirty. Ick. I wore socks all the time. Bottom line, it is a decent 3 star hotel in a good location. We didn't spend much time in our hotel anyway.

<Content>Do not stay here Although my husband and I have been back from our honeymoon for over a month weare still suffering from the disappointing experience we had at the StrozziPalace Hotel. When we first arrived we had to lug all of our luggage to anelevator that took us to the lobby. This took two trips, as the elevator issmaller than a closet, and without the staff offering any assitance. The girlat the desk who checked us in antonia seemed plesant enough howeverthe lobby and breakfast area lacked what a supposed four star quality hotelshould have. We made it up to our room and were surprised at how small it was,that our window faced a brick building and when we attempted to turn the airconditioning on it did not work. We promptly called down to Antonia at thefront desk to make her aware of the problem she proceeded to tell me of alaw in Italy that prohibited the use of air conditioning because ofthe pollution and told me that there is no air conditionin g! My husband and I, tired of traveling decided to leave our sad room andexplore Florence. We had a wonderful day and evening until we retured to thedreadful Strozzi Palace (I don#039;t know how they can rightfully have the wordpalace in the name). Since the air conditioning did not work we were forced tosleep with the window open, for which there was barely a breeze because it faceda brick wall. Not to mention the annoying buzzing in our ears and bites fromall the mosquitos that came in! Last but not least our room must have been madeof cardboard because we could hear EVERYTHING!!!! I could literally hear ourneighbor turning on and off the light switch!!! We listened all night to theelevator motor as it went up and down. That night was the worst hotelexperience I have had ever. The next morning we went to lobby and explained toAntonia how we will not be able to stay another night due to the above reasons. Not even listening to use the semi-pleasant clerk turned into the wicked witch of the west! Sheinsisted that we pay for 2 nights. We told her that we found another hotel, the Best Western down the street in which every room has air conditioning-she had no reply. When we finally spoke with the manager his excuse for the air conditioning not working was because it was going to snow...I was wearing shorts and a tank top. This is a horrible hotel with horrible customer service, we will never go back and we will make sure to tell anyone planning to visit Florence should not stay there either.

<Content>convenient, large rooms, very clean We stayed at the Hotel Strozzi Palace at the end of September and we were delighted by just about every aspect of the hotel. Our room here was half the cost and twice the size of any other hotel that we stayed at in Rome or Venice. I am very particular about a hotel being clean - I even travel with my own bedsheets, but our room was soo spotless that I didn't feel the need to use them. The staff was very helpful and polite and it was very nice to be able to walk just about anywhere of interest in Florence within a few minutes. When we stayed here the weather was both chilly for a few days and then hot for a few days, and the temperature in our room was consistantly very comfortable.

<Content>Great for Italy! Stayed here Sept 22  23. Big rooms, beds and a jacuzzi tub, although no shower curtain for showers. Good central location. Breakfast included eggs and meats/cheese. Housekeeping was good and fast. Only minor irritation was that we couldn't keep the a/c on at night, it kept switching off.

<Content>Replace the carpets The Strozzi Palace Hotel has many advantages...a great location, large quiet very dark rooms, and well appointed modern bathrooms...but, the carpet in the room was absolutely filthy...past the point of simply cleaning... they need to be replaced. The staff of the hotel is helpful, but not overly attentive.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay This hotel was wonderful. Excellent service, elegant beautiful rooms. We travelled there with our two children 8 and 6 and they just loved this hotel. It was truly beautiful and a real pleasure. Very comfortable beds, gorgeous architecturally rich rooms. A great jacuzzi tub. Would definitely stay again.

<Content>A Luxury hotel in florence We stayed at the Strozzi Palace hotel in late July, and had a room on the first floor where the reception and dining room are based. The room was nicely  luxuriously decorated with a huge bed and a jacuzzi - which was a pleasant surprise. We were based at the back of the hotel so could not hear a thing but the only disadvantage was that our window was facing a wall with pipes and there was no natural daylight at all. The room was totally dark during the day, which we did not mind too much as we only returned in the evening. We would definitely stay again as it was the best hotel we've stayed in during our trip to Italy. Location was ideal with all the shops and markets just a few minutes walk.

<Content>Strozzi Palace Hotel in Florence The hotel was really lovely and very clean. It gives one the flavor of Italy rather being a modern American type hotel in a foreign country. The breakfast was wonderful each morning and a great way to begin our day. Everyone was very helpful and tried to make sure that we had whatever we needed.We also stayed a week in Rome at the Hotel Eliseo a half block away from Via Venuto. The metro was very close plus it was a very nice area to walk around in day and night. It was clean and modern inside but had the European touch. The people were great here also; they helped in any way that they could. The breakfast room on the top floor provided a panaramic view of Rome as well as providing us with a delicious breakfast each morning. My only criticism is that our bed was rather hard - but then again I have a bad back so probably noticed it more than others might.
