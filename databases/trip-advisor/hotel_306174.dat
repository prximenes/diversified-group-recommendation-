<Content>i have only one word to express this hotel 'Real [--]' We went for a whole trip of FAR EAST. And the biggest 鈥渟ore鈥?in our whole trip was the accommodation provided in Singapore Grand Central. The rooms were small and stinking and the bathrooms were worn out and leaking. Over and above this their breakfast was horrible. We had breakfast only two days in Grand Central and for rest of the days we had to go to good restaurants outside paying from our pocket.We do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is travelling with family and please do take up our grievance to your Singapore counterpart.

<Content>Dirty, old, noisy, disgusting! I was ready to write a bad review of this hotel, but I see everyone beat me to it. If there were such thing as a 1-star establishment (is there?), this would be it. The front desk staff was reasonably nice and efficient. Check-in was quick and painless. Unfortunately, our hotel room was old, dirty, freezing cold and small. The furniture and sheets looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in years. It was noisy all day and night. Thank goodness I brought earplugs so I could partially drown out the yelling in the hallway. I wanted to wear flip flops while taking a shower - the bathroom was that disgusting. The breakfast buffet the first day was so gross and unsanitary that I skipped it the next day. The only good thing about this place is its central location to shops. I used a travel agent to book my hotels in Singapore and KL. Maybe I should find another agent because both hotels he put me in were filthy.

<Content>wouldn't allow my dog to stay in this dump This hotel is shabby and run down. I had to request a change of room as room 716 was extremely noisy and it was out-dated. The 2nd room, 823 was no better, the air-con wasn't working and we requested a fan which was also on it's way out. The shower curtain was covered in mildew and was smelly, the towels were old with no softness left on them.Singapore tourist board should close this hotel down. Breakfast was another let down. There was nothing positive to add. The water pressure was poor, couldn't have a good shower. The place is a dump. Ruined my holiday.

<Content>Bad Experience I was there end of August 2008, the only good thing is the location.People are unfriendly at the reception and only interested in doing the talking among themselves, the aircondition is centralized so during the night I was freezing and I had no opportunity to lower the temperature or switch it off:No pool available, no fitness center available, no breakfast included in the price (210 sgd)very old hotel, very poor service.

<Content>A Nightmare Stay To Remeber For Life I booked this hotel in Singapore as I've search through a lot of other hotels. Seriously considering Singapore a tourist attraction, i don't really think that the hotel rate are cheap. They are very high priced and it is not worth for us to pay for even a night stay. My story will tell you why.I arrived from Malaysia on 18th July 2008 at the wee hours of the Friday by a coach that alighted at Goldenmile complex. I was greeted by a taxi driver which drove a Sports Mercedes Benz. I told him that I've just arrived from Malaysia and needed to go to a money changer. He greeted me warmly and told me that he would be more than pleased to sent me to Mustafa Center which is open 24/7. I got my money changed and he then drove me to the Grand Central Hotel. We chatted all along the way to the hotel. I have to admit that in Singapore, you will pay a bomb for taxi services but rest assured you will be pleased with their warm service and polite attitude. I arrived at Grand Central Hotel approximately around 5 a.m. Before i forget, i've made a reservation for a room by credit card and called them to inquire about early arrival arrangements. I was greeted by a front office officer which is half asleep. He merely greeted me with his eyes half open while adjusting his spectacles. I passed him my booking conformation print out and he looked at it. He told me that i was too early and needed to wait until 7 a.m to try again. I have no choice but to accept his explanations. He did not even offer me to safe keep my luggage when i leave the counter front. I was then approached by the concierge who offered me to place my bags in the safe room area. I am in Singapore for a 2 nights stay in this hotel with my wife. I've read a lot of bad reviews on this hotel but i did not thought that mine would also be a nightmare as their website has stated that they have done a full make over of the hotel.At around 9 a.m, after having my breakfast in Toa Payoh i arrive back at the hotel to try my luck to get an early check-in. I was then attended by a girl with the name of Siti Sarah. It was a quick check-in and finally i got a room. But she has informed me that the room is not fully ready and needed to be cleaned by the housekeeper and i agreed. I was given a room in the 9th floor number 919. Upon reaching my room, i was greeted by very old condition of wall paper, old wooden panel of doors, and smelly scent of a run down hotel. Upon opening my room door, i found it much worst. All the make-over or upgrading that has been bragged about is a pure big lie. And mind you that i pay $168 for a premium room and a 3 star hotel ( I would rate it as a budget hotel) if not for its room capacity and location. After a while, the house keeper arrived and cleaned up the room. I needed a drink, and i ask the chinese housekeeper was it a complementary drink, and he said Oh Yes, sir and i took it and drank it. For all i know that i've been charge $2.35 for a 500ml of mineral water (Unbranded). The bed was ok, with very dusty blanket and sheet that causes me to sneeze throughout my 2 night stay, a big mirror that face directly at the bed (Very bad Feng Sui), air-con is working fine, but all the lights were very old and rusty.I was joined by my wife after her work and after the 1st day shock, i finally lay my head to rest. On the 2nd day, i've gotten up early to prepare for my appointment. After my appointments, I made my way back to the hotel and then out again with my wife to enjoy the day in Bugis, orchard and the town. We then return to the hotl at around 9 p.m to be greeted with more nightmare. When we returned, we were shock to find out that our rooms had been cleaned up with all my wife's clothes folded (Even her PC clothing were folded). This is the first time in my life after working more than 8 years in hotels and staying in many hotels around the world to have such a bad service. I double check with my wife that we did not put any Please make my room sign upon going out of the hotel room in the morning. As i know and learned in University where i graduated with a degree in Hospitality, it is not a wise think to access rooms with prior permission of the guest to make their rooms and more to fold female under garments (Bra and Panties). I then noticed that the ceiling access wall was lifted where there is none on the 1st day. i climb up to check for any hidden cameras as i have been told many times. To add things worse, the toilet is in a old condition with stained bath tub, and shower water that runs slower and me walking and temperature that is totally out of control. We then decided that it was a small issue and just to forget it without making any big fuss about it. But nightmare on the 3rd day morning made me wrote this review. We woke up at around 10 and we were having our bath before checking out. at approximately 11.30, i was greeted with the doorbell by a woman housekeeper (Supervisor) and before i could answer the door, she used the master key to push open the door. Lucky for me that i have latched the door with the latch. CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS SERVICE? RINGING THE DOORBELL AND LESS THAN 5 SECONDS SHE USED THE MASTER KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR? I then stormed my way to the door to keep it shut as my wife at that time was half naked. To amuse me more, she just hurriedly rushed away even though i shouted at her and ask her to stop for an explanation. When i ask for her name, She just snub at me and Said Lee JEN. I then called in to the front desk and requested for the manager to be greeted only by his assistant. I told him what has happened and all he could say was I am very sorry WHAT THE HELL? (if it was in Malaysia, the staff would be fired and the guest would get a night of free stay).A brief investigation was done and all he could offer me was a SORRY. When i told him about the room was trespassed, he say that it was a normal procedure for his housekeeping staff to clean all the room daily. With full of anger i just proceed for my check out and get my refund of deposit to be charged for that stupid mineral water that i drank.Here you go, a real story of why should the Singapore Government should review its charge for hotel rates or at least improve its services. For paying $168 (RM 402.36) without breakfast a night in Singapore, i only pay RM220 ($105) for HILTON in Malaysia and get a 5 star service with breakfast and to get such a bad service. I spend RM900 to pay for a run down hotel with bad service which has bragged about their make over and much more. My wife have taken some photos for proof and i will upload it at another time. Hope that no one will ever step into this hotel.

<Content>Good location; no problems A party of three, in Singapore on business for a day, we were looking for well-priced adequate accommodation close to the Orchard Road shopping precinct.I had read the reviews and was looking for other places, but our preferred hotels were fully booked, so we ended up at the Grand Central. From the reviews I thought it a place to avoid. However, I think sometimes people write hotel reviews when they've had a bad experience and not when they've had a good one.We found the reception and concierge staff very pleasant and efficient. The room was quite satisfactory - clean, no noisy airconditioners, no sound coming through the walls, the hot water jug worked, and the breakfast was excellent, with a good range of western and oriental dishes.There was a fridge, but no mini-bar in our room. No problem, because 7-11 is about three minutes walk from the hotel.The only complaint I might make, and it really didn't cause me any inconvenience, was that the shower pressure was too light and it was hard to get the right temperature.The big asset is the location - a ten-minute easy walk to Lucky Plaza, CK Tang, etc, and all the shops and plazas in between. What more could you want?

<Content>Good Value for Money for Central Location I have been visiting Singapore on business since 1975 and stayed in Five Star deluxe Hotels in and around Orchard Road.Although some travellers have found bugs and ghosts, I found the standard good value for money.The service at check-in was civilised and friendly. The concierge staff, specially Ronnie was extremely polite and helpful.However, if one is prepared to pay S$ 350-; per room per night, of course there are better alternatives.Personally I would not hesitate to book into Grand Central for value-for-money and decent standards of service.Stephen Lowe

<Content>Filthy and Disgusting! Having booked through a travel agent, we arrived late at night. The room was very old, with black, dirt-engrained carpet and furnishings. The top bed covers were dark brown fabric with white stains all over them, and the yellowing bed-sheets were all covered in brown stains. Replacement bed-linen was of the same poor condition. We changed rooms, but it was just as dirty and made you feel itchy and unclean. Luckily we remembered seeing a hotel reservation desk in the airport, which we called. Within 15 minutes they found us a five star hotel, which we went to immediately - and it was cheaper than the Grand Central! Unbelievably the Grand Central charged us for the night we did not stay - and could not understand the difference between a cancellation charge and the fact that their hotel was not fit to stay in. It was the worst place I have ever seen, and should be closed down!

<Content>Not as bad as I expected We booked our stay at Hotel Grand Central before we read the comments from this site. As soon as we read them, we wanted to cancel our booking. Good thing we didn't. It wasn't as bad as we expected it to be. Maybe because after we read the reviews we already expected the worst? Or maybe we were really just lucky to get a room that wasn't so bad.As tourists, we would always be out early in the morning and be back very late at night. So we didn't really mind if the hotel wasn't very nice. As long as we had a clean and decent place to spend the night in. Service was not so bad either. I think we just got what we paid for. The location was very good. We have nothing to say about the facilities because we didn't go there to enjoy them. We just needed a place to sleep. Reception was ok. Not very warm but we didn't need them to be warm. We just needed them to be professional and process our check in and check out without delay, which they did. I don't know, maybe we were just lucky that we didn't experience any major problems while we were there.

<Content>Seedy I was desperate. Sing seems hard to get a hotel in even in off periods. This one was taken as my flight date approached and all my well researched options had no vacancies.For the money easily the worst value.However others here had worse than me here.My experience - roof was partially caved in over the bath in the bathroom from rot. There was a similar cave in just inside the apartments front door - I wonder if someone above let their bath overflow in times past.A stained bath with a hand shower that would not sit in its rest so had to be held.A bizarre alcove with 2 chairs in it facing a TV on the opposite wall. 70s style wood panelling.The bed was OK. The AC worked. Creaking boards above us but thankfully no noises of children, or sex except ours.I was asked if I would be interested in young girls by a large smiling Indian woman in a capacious sari outside the 7/11 near the hotel. Apparently this area is renowned for it.The breakfast was busy, cold and uninspiring. No fresh milk even in a first world country. Cold hot foods - beans, chicken cocktail size sausages, eggs, tomatoes. Cereal. Singapore fried noodles. Thats about it. Watermelon diced witha bit of rock melon in a large bowl is the fruit option.Message - dont go here unless your only other option is the street. If you are going for the Orchard Rd location, consider a hotel a bit out of the way and less popular- eg Little India - the rail system MRT is fabulous and dirt cheap so really the location of your hotel is unimpotant as long as its near an MRT stop.Overall, I didnt care as I was seeing my gf for the first time in nearly 2 months. However, its neither romantic or salubrious. Hit and miss as per other readers. Dont let the foyer deceive you. Thats the best bit.I note its no longer on expedia.

<Content>The origianl Roach Hotel We considered this recent stay in Singapore one of the worst hotel experiences we've ever had. The first room we were assigned was right above the kitchen vent and the smell was awful as well as there being a broken toilet. When we asked for a new room we were given 707 which was dirty, smelly and bug infested. We had to call 3 times to the desk to get someone come up with a can of bug spray and do a quick round of the room. This kept the insects down for a day but the morning of our departure was a record for infestation. We counted at least 5 different species of bugs which we alternately chased and squashed. The only things we didn't have were bedbugs. Obviously the laundry department is doing their job right. In the past 3 months we've spent time in The Dominican Republic, New York City, France, Italy, Hong Kong  Bangkok and not once did we get a hotel room in the same price range as the Grand that came close to it's sub-par standards. We have visited Singapore many times over the past years, staying in different areas to get varying experiences and this is the first time we've been disappointed in the hotels. We have emailed the hotel directly to air our views but have been ignored completely.

<Content>Terrible - stay away! This was a terrible experience and I don't recommend this place to anybody. Granted it was just before the Chinese New Year, but the staff was discourteous and just didn't care about customer service. They seemed to be bothered by us and just wanted us to pay the bill. My room had no air conditioning and they didn't really seem to care or want to deal with it. The room was also on the top floor (8th) and there was some type of constant roar from something- maybe roof mounted equipment. Anyway, I was lucky that I only had to stay for a couple of hours since I had to leave early in the morning to catch a early flight out. Even the location is not great and I saw some types outside the hotel area that made me nervous. Our company won't be using this place anymore!!!!

<Content>You Can't Pick A Winner Everytime. A Pig-Sty I have stayed here three different times, on lay overs for flights. Twice in October 2006, and once in May 2007. Each time, the experience was worse than the one before. You can definately believe all the previous posts about this pig-sty. If I ever have another lay over in Singapore, and this is the only hotel avaliable, I'll sleep in a chair at the airport. The front desk staff and maintenence staff...just don't care! You'll notice that most of the smaller businesses have moved out of the rear arcade in this hotel. One of the travel agents that I had used there before, moved next door to the Holiday Inn's arcade, she told me that the Hotel Grand Central is scheduled to be imploded, to make way for a new high rise condo building. One of the taxi drivers also confirmed this. So, we can all, only hope so. It sure would be an improvement to have this place bulldozed.

<Content>Disappointing Husband and I had a one night stopover in Singapore en route to London from Australia. Expedia recommended this hotel as a 'good deal'. It was certainly well-located, in the heart of the shopping district, but the hotel was run down and the room frankly shabby with threadbare carpets and beaten up furnature. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room, the staff barely understood English. Not recommended unless you really do get it at bargain price, which we did not.

<Content>Incredibly terrible Have visited Singapore many times holidaying and did not think a hotel of this low standard could exist in such a wonderful place, especially so close to Orchard Road. Very old room and bathroom, desperately needed renovation. Bathroom leaked, drain blocked, shower constantly dripping - we reported this to reception every day we stayed to be told each time to call maintenance on our room phone...which didn't work! Horrible breakfast - enough choices of what should be hot food but all stone cold each day and restaurant horrid. Highly recommend Singapore as a holiday destination but not this hotel!!

<Content>Beware Its a Dump! I was told this was a 3 star hotel when I was at the Airport. I would not give this hotel a single star. It is old, dingy and in desperate need of renovation. The breakfast is horrible and there is someone on the door to make sure you are a guest, least you sneak in to get a horrible meal. Just go to McDonalds its a far better choice.Taxis that are waiting in front of the hotel are Touts they will not take you unless you give them $10.00 above the meter fare. This is illegal in Singapore, if this happens to you (And it will if you stay at HGC) take there plate number and report them to the Singapore Registry of Vehicles (ROV) there is a 1-800 number you can call locally. The desk staff is a little surly. The carpets are dirty in the rooms and there was 1 solid pillow without a pillow case that has probably not been cleaned in 20 years. Singapore is an expensive place to visit with the HGC you get less than what you pay for. My advice is stay somewhere else.

<Content>Don't Even Think About It! Despite the name there is nothing Grand about this hotel.It is old and shabby, service is poor and a definate no-no if you are looking for an enjoyable stay in Singapore.The rooms were small, dirty and poorly fitted and the reastuarant was the place NOT to be.Poor choice of food, no milk for drinks, dirty table clothes and cutlery if you could find somewhere to sit. And very noisy. The staff were few and far between and rushed off their feet which only made things worse.No one was smiling in the restaurant and the other guests we spoke to all felt the same. Some were trying to relocate they thought it so bad.It may appear good value but it's NOT. For what it is it's overpriced even at Singapore rates. We will not be trusting Asia Travel who booked us there again either.

<Content>It was fair Advantages: *rooms are pretty spacious *rooms are also clean *wide variety of breakfast *shower heaterDisadvantages: *hair dryer is collected when room is made up by housekeeping so you have to wait for another staff to bring back the hair dryer when you need it *you can only borrow one adapter. there were 3 of us in the room so we had to equally divide the time of charging our phones, digital cameras, iPods. so thats i think approximately 1 hour per electronic gadget. *our room didnt have LCD TV contrary to what was indicated on their website *no cable. there's only one channel with american shows *the shower head wasnt stable and you had to keep adjusting its position so that water wouldnt go outside the bath tub *staff werent helpful when it came to carrying your luggage. i just bought an LCD monitor (21.6 inches) from the mall and the bell boy only watched me while i carried it.

<Content>Ridiculous Rates / Awful Hotel I stayed here and found the service was rude and the rooms smelled. Though I often backpack, I still felt compelled to buy a clean sheet for the bed and a towel without holes in it. The worst part was that the supposed Health Centre was implied to be little more than a special massage shop for men. I was told very bluntly by a staff member that as a woman, I shouldn't go inside. And it was very overpriced.

<Content>Only an Eyewash and a Complete Sham Hi, I stayed at this place for nearly 4 weeks and I had to stay there since there were no other hotels available. The only positive I can write about this place is it proximity to Orchard Road. After that there are only negatives to list out:a) It is mentioned in the hotel facilities that there are In-house movies - But what you get is a TV, which airs the 6 free channels and one of the channels shows an english movie once in a while!b) Healthcenter with Sauna - What you get is a nearby massuer belonging to some other private person, who offers only Paid Massages and nothing else!c) Free Breakfast - There are only 6 food items, which are repeated every single day!d) Reception - The worst lot I have seen. I was to receive a very very urgent mail and was enquiring with them for 3 days as to whether they had received anything for me and despite having received the package 3 days back, they kept telling me NO! I had to finally contact UPS and get a confirmation from them as to whom they had given the package to!e) Coffee House and Cyber Cafe - They are paid and belong to some private party other than Grand Central!f) Swimming Pool - It is so tiny and so shallow that it should be called a 'Bath Tub' rather than a Swimming Pool.Towards the end, I would just say that people should avoid this place unless they are desparately looking for staying somewhere near Orchard Road!

<Content>Sordid hotel I booked this hotel expecting a bit of luxury at the end of a four week holiday to Asia and was bitterly disappointed. The only good point is its location, everything else is bad.1. Reception. Rude, unhelpful, cold. 2. Rooms. Untouched since the hotel was built. Therefore, carpets are stained, tiles are mouldy and chipped and electrical appliancies don't tend to work.3. Breakfast. Probably the worst I have had. Cold, stale, unimaginative and the dining room consisted of large communal tables with plastic table cloths. All plates are, of course, plastic and the nasty grease-leaden plastic flowers which simply adds to the sordid atmosphere of a sordid hotel.Thankfully I was only there for one night. Don't even think about going there!

<Content>The "pits" Missed my flight to Bangkok and had to spend a night in Singapore. Airport booking service didn't have much to offer so got a room at Grand Central Hotel @ SGD160 for the night. Room was very cramped and poorly appointed. Only positives were its location, just off Orchard Road and the price compared to anything else on offer late on a Friday night.In hindsight would have paid an extra $70-80 on a better place.

<Content>Very basic hotel Going by the previous reviews of this hotel, I suspect they may have recently underwent a renovation. My room was newish looking. Except for the main table everything else looked new. In my opinion the room was above average in terms of cleaniness. The doors now uses magnetic cards instead of keys. The room wasn't spacious but I'm not complaining with the price I paid. Otherwise it was a very basic hotel. I would get bored soon if I just stayed in the hotel the whole day. It had a big flat screen plasma TV but pity there wasn't anything good to watch except for the local TV stations. No recreational facilities. The bottled mineral water was not complimentary. My room had an iron and ironing board. Toiletries were renewed daily. Don't expect much of a view from your window though.Given the location and the room rates I'm quite pleased. Only thing if they could improve further was the breakfast. The menu and the venue made me felt as if I was having breakfast at a canteen or cafeteria at some workplace. In addition the food was bland and tasteless.

<Content>Awful, Awful, Awful A terrible hotel. Only thing good about it was the location. Our room was a dank and dark room on the eighth floor, infested with ants. We had to move our beds away from the walls just to get away from them, but when we spoke to reception, they told us it was the only room left. Breakfast was awful, and the pool was dirty. Please book elsewhere if you can.

<Content>Old and weary hotel I stayed in Grand Central last month as all the hotels in Singpaore are fully booked. and I thank god that I stayed for only a night. To be fair, its price is fair @ USD90 ++ and locationwise very central. The check in was slow, very manual and like some old European hotels, they still use metal keys for opening the room door. It's a very old hotel and I wonder if it ever was renovated ever since it opened its door to business.The room is clean actually, wall's thin (the guest next door was blaring on his cell phone) and there's no complimentary mineral water given, you have to boil your own water from the tap. Of course, the infamous breakfast, I was done in 10 minutes and didn't want to stay there one more moment. Eggs, fried noodles, toast with some cheap jam served in what seemed like a ballroom with big Chinese restaurant style tables. Location was its saving grace, for that kind of price and still be centrally located, I guess I should not complain, but will I return? Never.

<Content>Affirming Previous Reviews We have to bear staying at this hotel for 3 days, as hotel booking is crazy,. all hotels are fully booked until a week after holy week,. being fair with grand central, rooms were cleaned everday,. sheets were nicely done (that's the only thing i can cite as positive) FOOD is awful plus the exact same dishes were served everyday, toiletries were never replenished, room carpet was in a wear and tear condition, POOL don't even think about bathing or even laying in the pool side chairs,. too dirty you can imagine being infected! regretfully, the hotel wasnt able to maintain itself over the time,.

<Content>nightmare I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, just for people who can't spend money and is looking for the cheapest place close to the shopping center. The location is great but everything is awfull! The rooms are very poor and old with some bad smell.. I just dreamed to escape from this place as soon as possible. I will never ever come back in this hotel even if it would be for free. NO MORE in my life!

<Content>Absolutely awful I booked this hotel at the airport upon arrival in Singapore due to a mixup with my original hotel booking, so paid probably more than usual at S$176. Location was good, but that was about it. The hotel had a grimy feel to it just walking in. Staff were indifferent, lobby was dark, rooms were dirty - mine had rubbish and used toiletries in it from the previous guest. The room wasn't ready when I checked in, but they insisted I put my suitcase in the room anyway - not nice to enter the room I would stay in still uncleaned from the previous guest. The carpet was frayed and stained, the walls are thin, the room smelled - unfortunately cannot say anything good about this place. Wireless was only available on a couple of floors and in the lobby - S$16 for 3 hrs and you have to use it all at once. And they required a S$100 key deposit (I had prepaid) - just in case you might take off with something during the night! Wished I would have stayed at a backpacker's place which was the other alternative at the airport! Everything neat  tidy  clean you've heard about Singapore? This place is the antithesis! Yuck!

<Content>What you pay for is what you get It's a very simple hotel! Rooms are poor and you should not be surprised if you have to take a shower in cold water. Breakfast is really poor. However, the hotel is VERY central if you plan to shop at Orchard road. The rates are low and you get what you pay for.

<Content>Uniquely Singapore??? The Hotel Staff is really UNIQUELY RUDE! I thought I was paticulary fussy, but after reading the reviews, looks as if a lot more other have the same views  experience. Super Rude Reception Staff..Save your money folks!It's sad to have Singapore Tourism Board spend truck loads of money for their Uniquely Singapore campaign  to have Tourism Frontliners who'd try so hard to be Rude, Cold  totally unhelpful towards guests.

<Content>Nightmare on Cavenaugh Road Stayed overnight as most other hotels were full. The reception was cold (and it's not the temperature I'm talking about).The staff looked botox-ed. Room was musty as if it hadn't been aired in ages; the bathroom stank. No hot water in the tapsThe mattress was covered with hair!! Could hardly sleep --was so nauseous the whole night.Wished I had simply stretched out on the airport floor instead !!

<Content>Don't even consider staying here! Stayed here for 3 nights back in 2003. Our travel agent informed us that it was in a very good location and US$20 cheaper than Crown Prince Hotel and he would recommend we stay there. Boy were we every wrong for listening to his advice! The lobby was enough to scare us as soon as we entered. It was dark and old and the staff were not helpful at all. The rooms were downright appaling and had a musty smell that wouldn't go away! The beds were crappy, the walls were dirty, the bathroom was gross and moldy, the tv didn't even have its own stand (it was ON the mini bar ref)! The airconditioning was awful and we had to switch rooms twice before ending up in an acceptable cooler room. After a night in this hotel we were pretty much ready to cry and self-pity was definitely setting in. We later found out that the hotel was quite known for being a brothel! No wonder I was sent away from the spa place upstairs by the mama-san (pimp) saying that it was for MEN ONLY! Don't ever stay here!!!

<Content>WON'T NEVER GO THERE AGAIN It's the worst i ever had. Even though i ever go for the cheapest hotel, the service, the reception counter,the front desk counter, the room was not worst like this.1) When we arrive to check in, the front desk reception service are rude. Not even a smile to welcome the tourist. and How could they throw a pen when asking us to sign something??? so impolite and no manners2) They said they are giving us a non smoking room since we dont smoke but when we enter the room,that room got a strong smell of people's smoking. and are old looking.3) And the bathroom... the shower please do something on it, ask people to service.. or should i say the shower cannot be used. 4) I have call to the operator to complaint about the aircond was too cold and ask them to lower the temperature... the operator told me that it was a centralise aircond and will ask someone to check our aircond but then ends up i dont see any shadow of people coming for checking. 5) Breakfast.. worst i ever had, never had breakfast in hotel that have to share table with others and crowded as well. feel so uncomfortable when eating. and the food was boring... everyday the same not much choices. and if i am staying there for a longer period sure i prefer eating outside.6) When checking out.... the gal are unattentive. there's nobody else but only us. yet she do her thing first then only serving us. Come on, we are in urgent to go airport. Only 1 day i stay there, i already got the intention wanted to move to another hotel. if it's not that i've paid all.. i would have already moved out. i would never consider in staying this hotel again in my next trip.

<Content>Super Bad Hotel We have just returned from a 7 days at the Grand Central Hotel. The hotel is very poor and we have never experienced such incredible service before if based on their hotel services. We won't be consider and stay this hotel anymore. 1) Front desk services is impolite and never got any right answer which we request on front desk. 2) Room is super dirty and a lot of mosquito in bathroom and not tooth brush will be provided. TV is out of order. 3)Breakfast is not good and taste very bad and not much food for your selection.4) Room Charges US$102 + tax is very high if based on their service and quality. So, please do not consider this hotel unless you would like to have their bad services quality

<Content>DONT EVER GO THERE!! Let me start, I would rate this hotel a 0 for customer service. You know, our travel agent sent our tickets to the hotel and the hotel DID NOT GIVE IT TO US. We were forced to buy another set of tickets for our trip to Malaysia. When we came back, we found out that the tickets were with the hotel ALL THE time. In fact, we asked them if there was any mail for us twice, the night before and when we checked out. What angered me was that they didn't take responsibility for their negligence and lack of coordination. They won't even refund us the tickets!!!!! They blamed the driver who took us to the train station for not having checked with the front desk. But we asked them a mere 5 minutes ago!!! So we complained them to the Singapore tourism board and they weren't able to do anything about it. In fact, they promised to give us half of the amount but up to now we didn't receive ANYTHING AT ALL. And to think we were there November 2005. So, if you lose something there, or if someone sends you a very important document there, don't expect to get it.
