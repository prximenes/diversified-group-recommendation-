<Content>Potential to be exceptional ... but The views from the 65 floor are exceptional. We booked a three bed apartment for four adults and two children. The space, especially in the living areas is outstanding. The kitchen has everything you will need. My pet peeves were minor but given we stayed a week and paid close to AU$800 per night for four of the seven nights, I feel some of these were justified. The airconditioning turning off every four hours is really annoying especially when it is particularly hot and humid as it was during our stay. The beds and pillows are appalling. I have stayed in caravan parks that had better quality mattresses than the Meriton. Again, for the money you are paying, it wouldn't take much to improve these two (repeatedly complained about) issues. There is a monorail station below the apartment, along with a heap of shops - coles, liquorland etc - all are open quite late. Waiting for lifts can also be a real issue, especially between 8:30 - 10:00 am and again around meal times. We regularly waited up to 20 minutes. Staff were relatively helpful - I say relatively because unless you really pumped them for information on the surrounding area/restaurants etc, they didn't go out of their way to volunteer this. The departing invoice is not at all straight forward and when I asked for an explanation, it was given quite reluctantly. My husband has previously stayed at the Meriton in Pitt Street, so perhaps we will try that one next time.

<Content>Good but better elsewhere We have stayed four times at Meriton World Tower, booking through Wotif.com. The apartments are well furnished and depending on the room and the levels that they are on the views can be quite spectacular. The prices we got in 2005 for our room was excellent value for money but over time this has not been the case. Still, when compared to other hotels in the area, the price is reasonable.Our interactions with the staff have been mixed, though most have been friendly and courteous. On one occasion during check in, I asked whether or not the contact number on the form had to be a home phone number and the young man behind the counter insinuated that my partner and I were having an affair, when I was simply worried about my information being sold to telemarketers!One of our pet peeves when visiting the Meriton World Tower is that if you are assigned a lower level you have to take two elevators to get down to the parking lot. This means taking the elevator to the lobby and then snaking your way around the lobby to the next elevator. It seems like a minor inconvenience on paper but there is a lot of time wasted doing this, especially with the exceptionally slow elevator service. If you are above a certain level, you are able to go straight to the parking lot.Another peeve is that although Meriton World Tower is a serviced apartment, there is a clause in the agreement you sign upon checking in, that if there is unwashed dishes left in the sink left that you will be charged. Check out mornings can be rushed and stressful unless you are awfully good the night before!All that being said, we would not have stayed so many times if the experience had been entirely unpleasant. If the prices at Wotif were similar to the prices we paid for the first few visits we would continue to stay there, they were a steal. These days however, there is better value for money, service and quality elsewhere!

<Content>The view is amazing at the Meriton World Tower Booked four nights at the Meriton World Tower's on WOTIF and was very impressed with our three bedroom apartment on the 72nd floor. I requested a high level floor mainly to get an unobstructed view over other buildings. The apartment was $249 per night and was spacious and the view was truely special out to Sydney Heads and Eastern Suburbs. The apartments are large and had two bathrooms. The pool area is great with a spa and sauna area attached. Small things that need attention eg no pool towels, housekeeping always later in the day around 3ish, reception staff not overly friendly or interested in you (apart from swipping your credit card) means that I would rate it 4.5**. The location is fantastic and the monorail stop is right next door and there are shops and a Coles suprmarket underneath the building. I will return but definitely ask for a high level apartment as the view is amazing.

<Content>Absolutely Amazing!!! If you are traveling with a family look no further. This is going to be the best deal you find in the city. The location is out of this world (2 blocks from Darling Harbour) and the views are to die for. We booked a 3-bedroom luxury apartment and paid less than the cost for most hotel room in the city.Our unit was located on the 73rd floor. Keep in mind that the Meriton World Tower is one of the tallest buildings in Sydney. When you first enter the unit you have a large foyer with a desk, phone and oversized closet. This place had more closets than most family homes! The kitchen was fully stocked with plates, silverware, and cleaning supplies. A double oven, stovetop and stainless steel refridgerator as well. The living and dining rooms were larger than most hotel rooms. The living area had a modern L-shaped couch, LCD TV and a DVD player. The entire unit has floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city. We weren't on the Darling Harbour side:-( but our view was still spectacular. It was like looking down on a street map!Each bedroom had a king-sized bed, plenty of luggage space, and multiple closets. The Master Bath had a jacuzzi tub and seperate shower, while the 2nd bath had a walk in shower that could fit an army. The small laundry room was the icing on the cake.We never made it to the indoor pool located on one of the mid-floors. We looked though and it was gorgeous...kind of scary with all the windows though! Internet is a charge which I was not happy about, but I realized that that was the case throughout Australia..very different from the US.All in all I could not find anything bad to say about this place. In my opinion it is one of the best I've ever stayed at and is the only hotel I would recommend in Sydney. Happy travels!

The apartments have a fully serviced kitchen and 2 bathrooms.Great location with a short walk to Darling Harbour or the Harbour Bridge.Would definetly recommend this place -especially good if you have a large group of people staying together.

<Content>Meriton - Perfect location for Sydney stay. Our family of five (including the visiting inlaws) stayed at the Meriton earlier this month during a quick sight seeing trip to Sydney.Fantastic!!! The Meriton is perfectly placed for a visit - near the corner of George St near the cinemas. This makes it very accessible for public transport and cabs. There is a shopping centre underneath the plaza area on which the apartments sit - very convenient for small shopping trips to stock up on supplies.We had a three bedroom apartment on the 72nd floor. There were two bathrooms and each bedroom had a king size bed so lots of room for everyone. There was a sofabed in the living room.The bathrooms, kitchen and bedrooms were all top notch. The beds were hard (very hard!) but we didn't travel to Sydney for the beds. Views out of the windows were amazing and very impressive to the visitors.The apartment was starting to show wear and tear which probably needs to be addressed - and it would have been nice for the reservations staff to point out that there is a gorgeous indoor pool for guest use. Maybe next time.Something to keep in mind....because we had such a large group and needed a maxi cab...the staff arranged a private van to drive us back to the airport at an amazing price.

<Content>Amazing apartment, great view I got a great last minute deal on this apartment and upon arrival I was amazed at the quality. My and my family stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment. Here we had wonderful views over Sydney. All of the fixtures and fitting were of very high quality and the apartment was clean and tidy. During our stay we had the benefit of being able to use a lovely swimming pool and jacuzzi aswell as a games room with a couple of pool tables.I would definately recommend this to anyone visiting Sydney.

<Content>Excellent Location and Facilities We have just returned from a week stay in Sydney and had a marvellous time. We booked a 2-bedroom apartment at the World Towers which was as excellent as any 5-star hotel in the city. Prices were reasonable although the weekend rates are a bit hefty. Views of Sydney from the apartments are magnificent. The daily housekeeping service ensure that we have fresh towels each day. The personnel even washed all our plates and cups again even though we have washed them ourselves! The laundry and dryer came in handy as I was washing our toddler's clothes daily due to the mess that he sometimes get himself into.The fully equipped kitchen was a tremendous help as I was fixing wholesome and nutritous meals for our 23 month old toddler each day. The location of the apartments meant that I could pop down to Coles supermarket located in the basement of World Square anytime to get our daily essentials like diapers, formula milk as well as oats and cereals. If you need to rent a car which we did, you can just pop to Avis which is right around the corner on Pitt Street. The apartments are also close to Darling Harbour, Powerhouse Museum and Chinatown whic are just a short stroll away. QVB and Circular Quay are only a bus ride away. The receptionists on duty each day were very businesslike but helpful in assisting us with our needs. I wouldn't say that they are friendly except for the one who helped us book a day tour to the Blue Mountains. The only downside I have are the noisy party revellers jamming the lifts on the weekends. This is despite the fact that the property has a strict no party policy. Nonetheless, I was impressed with the facilities overall and would definitely stay here again when we come back in 2010.

<Content>Great Place To Stay HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR STAY:1. Arrived at hotel at 10 a.m. after an overnight flight and we checked in immediately.2. Without requesting it were upgraded to a two bedroom, 2 bath on the 52 floor with an outstanding view of Darlng Habour. Balony glass enclosed so always usable.3. Staff friendly and very responsive. We had trouble hooked up our internet and someone arrived without 10 minutes to solve the problem. Regardless of problem, we received the same prompt service.4. Comfortable bed, bathrooms normal size but had long roomy counters. Important to me since I have lotions, potions, and makeup that take up lots space.5. Close to food store, attractions, and Information office at Darling habour. Information recommended: Bontique Wine Tour(great all day trip to Hunter Valley--highly recommend), Blue Mountain(ended up the only two on the tour with Rob who owns the business. One on my favorite tours during our time there.), Sydney Habour Coffee Cruise a pleasant way to see the habour.6. The building does seemed to be filled with mostly young adults. We did NOT find it noisy or in anyway affected by having so many young people living there. 7. Only negatives were the bacony needed to be swept and scrubbed before our arrival. Spa did not work the entire time we were there even after reporting it repeatly.

<Content>Loved this apartment! We stayed at these apartments before flying out from Sydney the next day and just loved the place!We were staying on the 65th floor with the most amazing views over Sydney. The floor to ceiling windows were fabulous!The apartment was very spacious and so very comfortable too - I didn't want to get out of the bed in the morning it was just too cosy.It was very well equipped particularly if you were staying for a longer time period which we were sad that we weren't.Although the place is very busy we had no problem with noise from any other apartments either which is something in such a large place.The check in staff were very friendly and when our original room wasn't available we were moved immediately to another one. They even came and separated the beds for the two children who were sharing a room.The secure underground carpark was a real bonus too, even at the price, to be able to leave your cases in the car overnight is great.We really enjoyed our stay at the Meriton.

<Content>Excellent location, Cheap beds, no service I am here in Sydney for a month at one of these serviced apartments. Overall I feel that my stay has been subpar.First the good - location, location, location. These apartments are in the middle of the CBD and a quick walk to many great things. There's a mall underground that has some decent restaurants, a grocery store, a drug store, a liquor store, and a video store. There are always a ton of cabs driving by. And within about 5 minutes you're at oxford street which has some cool shops and a ton of bars and clubs.The building is also pretty nice - the apartment I am in is on the 63rd floor. I have a view of Darling Harbor and the city.The decor is average, there's some random pictures on the wall, blue and tan carpeting that appears to be the type that easily masks stains. The three bedroom apartment has two bathrooms - the master bath has a nice whirlpool tub, the secondary bath has a shower. Both showers have the handheld shower heads and the bathroom size is pretty generous.Now the bad -- for me, the biggest reason I even get a hotel/serviced apartment, is so that I have a place to sleep. The beds here are horrific. They take two single beds and push them together, leaving a large enough gap in the middle so that it's unsleepable. Right now there is about a 5cm gap. The beds feel like someone took about 50 hard springs and stretched a thin sheet over them. You can feel each coil and it's not comfortable at all. My coworker actually has started sleeping on the floor which he says gives him a much better rest. I'm considering starting to try that. A motel 6 has a better bed than this. Even sleeping on top of the covers, I can feel each painful spring.The maid service here does the bare minimum - changing the sheets and towels once a week. Even if you call to ask for extra service. They occasionally change the sheets in one room and leave the other two untouched. They vacuum exposed areas but never move anything to vacuum underneath it. They wipe exposed surfaces but wouldn't dream of moving a glass to the side to wipe under it.The air conditioning is also a pain - it automatically shuts off after 8 hours, so when you wake up in the middle of the night, the apartment is hot and humidWhile this apartment may seem like a good deal, unless you BYOB (bring your own bed), it's not worth it at any price.

<Content>Superb views and good value We booked in to the Meriton World Tower for one night at the start of a party long weekend, and were checked in by the security staff as our flight was a late one. Very low key reception (which was good), and once we received our keys we were left to our own devices.Our two bedroom unit had stunning city views with a very nice enclosed patio, an adequate lounge room and a superb master bedroom complete with a clean, spacious and well equipped bathroom. The room felt secure and private, and we were able to come and go 24/7 without any problems. The only dark spot on our stay was a complete lift jam come check out. As EVERYONE was trying to leave around 10am, the lifts became ridiculously congested, and it took us some 15 minutes to get downstairs. This didn't pose any problems for check out, but it was a little frustrating. Search for reduced room rates in advance and you should be able to get a nice price. The World Tower is super central, convenient and comfy, and I'd definitely stay here again if the price is right.

<Content>Wonderful stay for our family Staying at the Meriton Apartments made our stay in Sydney very special. Arriving from the UK very early in the morning, we were greeted by very friendly staff on the desk who stored our bags and gave us a ring to let us know when our apartment was available earlier than 2pm. We had a 2 bedroom apartment on the 69th floor and wow what a view! Waking early with jetlag we had the benefit of watching the sunrise over Sydney Heads. The apartment was very clean, modern and spacious. We had no problems at all with the lifts or the air conditioning. Having the kitchen meant we could have a lovely lunch out and then retire back to the best view in Sydney for a cheaper meal and early night. Perfect for a family.

<Content>Simply... WOW I booked this through Meriton'sown website, as they are usually a few bucks cheaper than anywhere else. I have stayed here around 10 times in the last year, so am probably well positioned for a fair review.Location: you can't get much better than this!Parking: Very confusing. There are no clear signs on the street. World Centre is on the block of Liverpool, George, Pitt and Goulburn streets. There are car park entrances on all four streets - parking for Meriton enters on Goulburn Street.The check in was pretty average, the staff seem to be disinterested and pretty humourless. Bear with them, they have dull jobs at the end of the day.I have found that a last minute deal is usually the best way to get a well appointed apartment - they seem to 'fill up from the ground up' - selling the cheaper, low floor apartments first, then selling the higher ticket ones for less when they haven't sold at their 'rack rates'.All the apartments are of excellent quality. Appliances are good quality - it's easily possible to whip up a great meal with everything in the kitchens. Entertainment - All rooms have Foxtel, so plenty of TV to chhose from. Failing that, there is a DVD player and stereo too, so if you have your iPod, you're in business!Most of my visits have been in the 1 or 2 bed apartments, and usually on a high floor. North and North -East facing apartments have the best views of Darling Harbour and The Rocks. Comforts are above average, and the beds are usually two single beds joined together. In spite of this, they make for a good night's sleep. The bathrooms are great - the showers are powerful and the baths (sometimes spa baths) are enormous.All in all, definitely well worth the extra few bucks.

<Content>Fantastic apartments with incredible views I booked this accomodation after reviewing the best hotels listed on the TripAdvisor website for Sydney. The three nights including parking came to about $900AUD which was more than I wanted to pay for our stay, but figured that if it was in the Top 10 on TripAdvisor it was probably going to be good and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. The apartment itself was absolutely spotless and the rooms very large. For a family travelling with three young children it was ideal. Plus the view from the 68th floor was absolutely incedible.The location is literally 5 minutes walk from Darling Harbour so perfect for exploring and there's a monorail train station right on your doorstep.So, what can I say that wasn't great? Not much really. I did find one of the receptionists a little indifferent but then all the others were really helpful, and that's about it.

<Content>unplesant staff overall, the hotel room is amazing. the place was clean, the views were amazing and the location was great. however, before going i read reviews on the hotel claiming the staff were unfirendly and that the air conditioning didnt work properly. this was very true. it was either too hot or too cold in the room and the staff were far from friendly when checking in, checking out and when we called from the hotel room down to reception. the signs everywhere about noise were very strict and uncomfortable. a few days after staying there, they had taken bond money out and it took a long time to fix the mistake up.

<Content>what a view! We booked this apartment for our family from the hotel website for A$284/night and stayed there for one night.Parking was a bit of a challenge. Parking facility is available for guests for A$35/night/car. The guest parking is only accessible from one of the parking gate (on Goulburn street). There were no signs at all to direct us. We went through the public parking boom gate then about 50 meters after getting the parking ticket, we found the guest parking area.The receptionist was quite standard, but they failed to tell us that we need to exchange our parking ticket there before we get out of the parking downstairs. However, one of them went to the boom gate to give us the parking ticket when we went out so that we can get out of the parking building without paying on the public boom gate.We got the apartment on the 70th floor. As soon as we went in we were absolutely stunned by the view and the apartment. The living room was very spacious, and the view was breathtaking! It was like we're in sydney tower! (just watch out if you're scared of height). The kitchen was clean and had all the utensils that we needed. The bedrooms were clean and had their own city view. There was also a built-in wardrobes and separate bathroom in the master bedroom. There was also an internal laundry facilities in the apartment. The apartment also has a ducted airconditioning system which kept the place in a comfortable temperature. But somehow the bedrooms felt hotter than the living room.The apartment's location is also great. Right in the middle of the city. I would absolutely recommend this apartment if you're planning to walk around the city.

<Content>Very Reasonable Looking for reasonably priced accommodation in Sydney? Look no farther. Within 10 minutes of Darling Harbor, and right in the center of the CBD (Central Business District) is a clean, spacious, and affordable apartment complex. We stayed for 6 nights in a 3 bedroom apt on the 64th floor. We had terrific views over Darling Harbor. The apartment was very large, and the two bathrooms were well appointed. The furnishing were reasonable and there was more than enough space for our family of 4. There was no balcony so there is no safety hazard for families of small children. The kitchen was a bit small and lacked some amenities but did have the basics.The apartments are serviced daily. The pool and jacuzzi are on floor 61.The main benefits of the Meriton are the location, the huge size of the apartment, the same cost (or less) than a good hotel, and the cleanliness. The downside was that the elevators were slow, and it cost $100/week for internet access. I would strongly recommend this place for families or couples who are interested in good value for money and don't wish the perks of a fancy hotel.

<Content>Fantastic 5 star apartments Fantastic apartment. We stayed on the 62nd floor with sunset views over Darling Harbour. The two bed apartment was true luxury, with a spa bath off the main bedroom. It was a good size and had a wonderful glass extension with fab views. The staff were polite. Stay here, try and get a upper floor with darling harbour views.

<Content>Just luxury We were given an upgrade to a massive apartment on the 63rd floor with a great view of Darling Harbour and beyond. The apartment war truly luxurious with everything you could need. The world cover is right in Chinatown and next to the Monorail station. Just a great stay.

<Content>5 star price for a 3 star experience Just spent 4 nights at the Meriton World Tower Sydney. Yes, location is perfect- walk to Darling Harbor, trains, shopping. And the apartments are very large with gorgeous views. But that's about as far as the positives go- we spent our first two nights without air conditioning and were never really given a direct answer about when it would be fixed from the front desk. On the second night, after we inquired for the 3rd time that day when it would be fixed, they offered to either move us to another property altogether (this was already at 7:00pm and we had two toddlers with us) or give us the night free if we stayed in our hotbox. For the price we were paying we decided to stick it out and give them one more chance to fix it. On the third day, still not fixed and we ended up moving rooms anyway. Next, there were actually signs posted in the elevator lobby that during checkout time (promptly at 10:00am and you had better not be late or late fees would apply) the lifts got very busy so they actually suggested that you should checkout early so you weren't penalized. They implied that WE would be charged if their elevators were too busy to get us downstairs in time. And as mentioned in several other reviews, we were so stressed about losing a key or damaging something that it was hard to relax. I even laid down dishtowels on the chairs because I was paranoid by 3 year old would spill something. Also, I realize this is a serviced apartment and not a hotel, but there was no mention on their website that they do not provide baby cribs and only through a follow up phone call prior to arrival did I discover this. They gave me the number of a place to call to arrange for my own rental- where is the 5 star service?And, their no party policy/ excessive noise policy is bogus as on both Friday and Saturday nights we were woken up several times by drunks coming and going between 2 and 4am. Finally, I couldn't agree more with previous reviews that the beds are awful- two beds pushed together with a hard seam up the middle. On the weekend we were paying $500 AUD/per night so if you can get a really good deal, this place might be worth it. Otherwise, I'd recommend everyone to pass on this place.

<Content>Awesome!!! Probably the best hotel experience I have ever had! 1. Front Desk and Housekeeping service was Brilliant. 2. Rooms were massive. Views amazing (3 bedroom)3. Loaction perfect.. right next to chinatown/CBD/darling harbour/shops/cafes etc etc.4. I booked on the meritonapartments website and was given a garuanteed lowest rate.Most of the feedback on this webiste is positive but to those who had a negative experience I think it must have been a one-off... because I chatted to many guests and we all had great things to say about the place.I now prefer to stay in these spacious serviced apartment than an overpriced hotel room the size of a box! Cant wait to go back to World Tower again soon!Thank you!!!!

<Content>Great Location We have just stayed 2 nights in this hotel in a 3Brm Apartment at the end of our stay in Sydney. We booked this at the last minute for a good price and it was just as we expected -going from information on site we booked from.We were on the 73rd floor and had amazing veiws to the west. Only complaint probably would be as another poster mentioned-the air conditioning. Should not shut off after 4hours but should be continuous. Woke during night to restart as it gets stuffy. Would also have been nice to walk into a cool apartment after being in heat outside during the day.Location was fantastic - walking distance to many restaurants and eating places  Paddys Market. Can Recommend

<Content>Not for those with vertigo! We stayed here for 6 days while in Sydney last summer and it was brilliant on all levels. The location is central and easy to find. The apartment was equiped to a very high standard. The views were AMAZING. Standing next to the floor to ceiling windows can be a bit scary tho'!We stayed on the 66th floor and couldn't get enough of the views until we found that the pool area had an even better panorama! It would not be too strong to say that this was one of the highlights( please forgive the pun) of our time in the city and we will reccomend it to all our friends.

<Content>Absouloutly Stunning I I was travelling along with a group of 4 other girls. We arrived at the airport and caught a bus to The merriton World tower. As soon as I stepping into the charming foyer, I felt at home. Although the street outside the main entrace was quite smelly and noisey, as soon as you walked into the lobby, all that was blocked out. We then went into room number 645 ( I think ) and it was breathtaking. The enormousglass windows was brilliant as you could see the entire city. The lounge room was very spacious and the bedrooms were private and comforatble. We could have easily had atleast 3 more people staying with us because of its great size. At night I went to sleep by staringout into the city and the fenominal light display. It was a memorable trip!

<Content>Not all apartments have good views! After reading many reviews on this website and doing a bit of other research, I went ahead and booked a two bedroom apartment at the World Tower (I booked directly with the hotel). I was under the impression from my reading, that 2  3 bedroom apartments were all on floors higher than 61 and assumed we would have the spectacular views described by other reviewers - not the case! We were given an apartment on floor 58 which sounded promising enough...but upon entering the room we were greeted with an excellent view into the office block opposite (I'm talking just metres away, not somewhere over the road!) - it was like being in a fishbowl, no privacy whatsoever. We would have had to pull the shades for the whole stay. The thought of a week in this room on full display to whoever was looking was not a good one - we asked at reception if we could please be moved. Quite a lot of other people were at reception also asking to be moved for similar reasons. After a bit of a wait we were able to move to another apartment on floor 35 but on the other side of the building, in a corner room. The views are still largely of other buildings but not right in your face like the first apartment. However, I am still disappointed that we were not able to stay on the really high floors that others have raved about. So, just be aware that booking a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment does not guarantee a higher floor! I have since checked some of the online hotel booking websites and they seem to guarantee a high floor - booking direct with the hotel definitely does not. You'd need to be on floor 61 or above to clear the tops of other buildings, particularly if you are in a room on the side facing the Ernst  Young tower.Apart from that particular disappointment, the apartment is good for a family. We have found the staff to all be OK (not enough of them for the volume of people they have to deal with) and no problems with waiting for lifts at all. The location is great. No party or neighbours noise but there is a bit of annoying traffic noise in the bedrooms (at this level anyway) - not super loud, but irritating. The air conditioners are set to go off on a timer every four hours; ours seems to go off only once every 24 hours - the place gets really stuffy and hot without air con - if it was going off every 4 hours I'd be getting pretty annoyed. The apartment at this level has a balcony that is half enclosed like an atrium, and then an outdoor area which is too noisy to want to sit out on, but handy for checking the outside temperature before venturing out for the day. It's actually a better layout than the higher floor apartment we first had, which had only an enclosed balcony and thin white shades which would have let in heaps of light - no sleeping in! There are proper sunblock drapes in the bedrooms of this apartment.If I did stay here again, I would make sure to guarantee a higher floor or to ask for one on the city side of the building - the room we are in now is OK, I'd be happy enough to get the same apartment - but a higher one would have been far better!

<Content>A view to die for. The most amazing apartment. We were lucky enough to stay here for 5 nights at the begining of october. We were upgraded to a 3 bed apartment on the 75th floor. The apartment was huge, very comfortable and had everything you could need. The building is only 4 years old and is finished to a very high standard, Placed well for getting around sydney. Central monorail is very close by. Taxi easy to get and not to pricey. Every meal we had in sydney was great, no bad service or attitude with the great service.Apartment serviced every day. Staff vey nice. The lift was a whole other experience, so fast yet so smooth. Views over darling harbour and the city were truly breathtaking through the floor to ceiling glass in the living area and bedrooms. At night the views were totally different again. If we ever return to sydney, we would not even bother to look for anywhere else. Only the Mertiton would do. A truly fantastic start to our trip to oz. Do the twilight bridge climb if you get the chance.

<Content>Worst Serviced Apartments Ever! After waiting half an hour to check in, our apartment was not ready on arrival. The extremely rude people at reception let us know they would call us (in approx 45 minutes) when the room was ready. We gave up waiting after an hour and a half  returned to find the room ready. No apology as to why they hadn鈥檛 contacted us. Rooms were spacious and clean, but for a relatively new building  $1000 per night for a 3 bedroom apartment, the TV  stereo were of very poor quality. Showerheads didn't stay on their holders (quite frustrating) and the dishwasher was blocked. The air-conditioning was a joke - since there are no opening windows you need it on all the time in order to stay alive, but unfortunately the aircon automatically turns off after 4 hours, so at 3am the place is sweltering. We also received an extremely unpleasant visit from over-enthusiastic security guards who told us to break up a quiet 10:30pm card game or leave the building immediately. We whispered good night to each other and crept off to bed. Ironically the place next door had two loud parties both nights and were never thrown out. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

<Content>Excellent Stay Stayed at the Meriton World Tower for 3 nights from the 26th September. Booked a 3 bedroomed apartment to cater for 5 people and was not disappointed. All rooms were lareg with the main bedroom ensuite fantastic. Great place to stay for a family wanting space and privacy should you want a bit of time out. Kitchens were very well equipped and great as there was a Coles Food Store on the basement level of the complex. But if you did decide that you wanted to eat out, then you could take advantage of a huge choice of eateries close by to the Meriton. View was absolutely stunning - we did not feel the need to pay to go to the top of the Sky Tower to get the same view.Rooms were very very clean, staff at check in and check out were courteous, friendly and profressional - even when dealing with a rather demanding obnoxious guest checking in the same time as us. Facilities i.e. pool, spa, gym great.  Found the location to be excellent - only found it a 20min walk to Circular Key and this was only due to the fact that there were so many people on the streets it slowed you down. But close by to Market, Darling Harbour, which also could be accessed by Monorail. In all this was an excellent choice and absolute value for money for our short family stay in Sydney. In amongst the hustle and bustle of the city, but once you escape to your apartment you are surrounded by the peace and tranquility of your own space. Would definitely recommend and stay here again.

<Content>Huge rooms and what views! We spent 5 nights here as the final part our honeymoon in September. We had a two bed appartment on the 65th floor and it was Huge.The living area is truly enormous with an enclosed balcony allowing excellent views over Darling Harbour and towards the Blue Mountains.We spent several nights with a glass of wine just watching the sunsets and the city below.We arrived early and the checkin staff were professional and courteous. on check out we were met with the same professionalism being given access back to the gym changing rooms so we could wash before our evening departure to the airport.The pool is on the 61st floor and very good with a large jacuzzi.So what are the downsides:Location is a bit out the way- 30 mins to the Opera house.The lifts could be slow at peak time- check out/early evening.The decor could be more stylish- it was fine but fairly functional.The no party rule for Sat nights is liberal- although we were not disturbed it was clear from the guests in the lifts (and the beer they carried) parties were taking place).If you want good views you need to book at least a 2 bed suite as these are on the higher floors.BUT- I would definitely stay here again, the space was huge and the views were stunning. If you are a group or a couple try it as it is far better than the traditional hotel option.

<Content>Terrific Family Accomodation We had five nights, Sunday to Friday at the Meriton World Towers. Our two bedroom apartment (upgraded to three) on the 69th floor was the largest apartment accomodation we have experienced anywhere in Australia. The apartment was clean and serviced with ample towels bedding etc. It had a well equipped kitchen for the nights you wanted to stay in and save some $'s on dinner. The view was fantastic with a NE aspect spanning Botany Bay all the way around to Darling Harbour. The Bridge and Circular Quay was blocked out by the CBD buildings. The pool was used by the kids but was not overly warm. A Coles Supermarket is in the shopping complex next door as is the MonoRail Station. Two main train stations are within 400 meters of Meriton. Five minutes walk to China Town and Meriton is surrounded by varying cost restaurants/take away outlets. All in all a great week in the centre of Sydney with a welcoming apartment to come home to for rest and relaxation. Thoroughly recommended for families.

<Content>Great experience I stayed at the Meriton World Tower in April 2007 with a group of friends and we all thought it was great. We were on one of the higher level floors, with spectacular views and an absolutely huge room. I cannot say enough about the view. The room itself was large and clean, with a kitchen and lounge area, and also with additional furniture located at the window so that you could sit and just look at the view. The only downside is that the lift is sometimes a little slow, but the view more than makes up for this. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again myself. Do not hesitate to stay here.

<Content>"No Party Rule" not strictly enforced. My family stayed at the World Tower Aug for two weeks. The place is great, clean, amazing view. Except, it's obvious that the No party policy is not strictly enforced. On both weekends, I had to call to complaint about loud music and yelling, Trying to tell the guard, and figure out where the noice were coming from, while my young children were already sleeping. That was a pain. I had call to complain the first weekend and the second weekend. Saturday, when we returned from dinner about 10:00pm, got into the evelator to go up, the lift was packed with 1/2 drunk bacherlors. They repeately asked whether we were going up, and where the chicks were? That was complete turned off, especially with family members in the lift. Unless MWT strictly enforce the no party rule, where people are not booking the rooms to party on the weekens, I am sorry to say, we will not stay at the MWT again. It does appear that on the weekends, people book MWT to party. Rating MWT: Excellent when there are no parties during week days. Terrible on the weekends. By the second weekend, I was actually dreaded that the weekend was coming, knowing the party crowd would be there!!!!! Cheers, Familyvaction.

<Content>You won't find anything better than Meriton Towers Stayed in 2 room apt on 69th floor for 2 nights,checkin was smooth. We were early so room not ready,we left our bags there and they phoned us when it was ready so we didn't waste any time. Checkin was a breeze,very helpful friendly staff. The room was clean and beautiful. The view takes your breath away,we looked over Darling Harbour.It had 2 bathrooms and spabath. Kitchen with everything you could want.The beds were comfy and lovely quality sheets and towels.Had no problems with the lifts. Tried the swimming pool and it was lovely. I couldn't fault anything about this place. on checkout they kept our bags for the day so we could spend the day out as we had a late flight out. The staff couldn't have been more helpful to myself and my disabled elderly mum. i would recommend it to anyone, I wouldn't stay anywhere else now i have found this place,just hope i can book in when I want when word gets out.

<Content>Great location, great views, great place to stay! We were looking for a child friendly, 2 bedroom serviced apartment with something special to celebrate a birthday - and that's exactly what we got. The apartment was very large with fantastic views - we got a corner apartment which gaves us 180 degree views of Sydney. Our 14 month old daughter loved leaning against the glass and looking down 64 floors to the streets below!The apartments are very close to Darling Harbour with easy access to everything else - perfect.We didn't experience any problems with the lifts and the apartment was well serviced and clean (having said this, we did find a cockroach in the bathroom!!). We had all the kitchen 'stuff' we needed and there's a supermarket in the complex for groceries.The only downsides were that check in was very busy and we had to wait past 2pm for our room to be ready and the bed in one of the rooms in our apartment was very uncomfortable. For us, the amazing views and size of the apartment made up for this.

<Content>Great place to stay in Central Sydney Stayed in a two-bedroom apartment on the 67th floor (Room 6702) for 11 nights. The apartment was clean, spacious enough and well equipped. Views out of the winter room overlooking Darling Harbour were magnificent. Reception and service was acceptable and we never had to wait too long for the lifts. Having World Square shopping arcade directly below was fantastic - made getting groceries and other essentials very convenient. Location was also very good, within walking distance of Darling Harbour and city centre. Only hiccup was we had to switch apartments for a night when the cooling/heating system in our unit broke down. The problem was fixed within 24 hours, but moving back and forth between apartments was a pain. Would definitely stay there again in the future.

<Content>Knockout Views Booked hotel a couple of days before ariving back in Sydney, took hotels bus from airport which was speedy and not expensive at AU$20 return. Reception was quick and easy. There are enough lifts that mean you don't have to wait too long. We had a three bedroom apartment on 72nd floor and WOW what a view. It took me a while to get used to standing by the windows, but soon got used to it. You don't need to pay to go into the Sydney Tower if you are staying here that's for sure!The rooms are modern and functional with all the kit you need if you want to eat in, but it's cheap to just get in the lift and find somewhere round the corner to eat, Chinees, Sushi, Italian as well as the usual burger joints. Plenty to chose from and enough corner shops if you want to get things to to cook yourself.The mono rail is right there to hop onto and see around the area. Taxi's are everywhere and with the apartment being between Pitt  George, you can't ask to be anywhere more central.If you manage to get a good price then these apartments are hard to beat.

<Content>Shame about reception Hotel is average, apartments Ok, but the reception staff were not interested and talked to each other whilst we tried to check in. They failed to tell us which key activated which lift, that reception was closed after 10pm or that using American Express cost more than other credit cards.The rooms were adequate, the noise on the Saturday night terrible. (The No Party rule is obviously not enforced.) The central location was fine, but the pool and closed sauna a disapointment. Perhaps the Meriton on Pitt street would have been a better option?

<Content>Top of the World! My friend and I rented a 2 bedroom apartment on the 70th floor of Meriton World Tower. Upon arrival at the hotel at around 11am, we were checked-in immediately without having to wait until the official check-in time of 2pm. This was great because we could unpack our stuff and catch a short nap before going for lunch. The apartment was very spacious and well-lit. For most parts, it was very clean and well-maintained with the exception of some stains on the sofa and the couch on the balcony area. My friend and I both agree that the beds were by far one of the most comfortable ones we have slept on!

<Content>Out of this world The meriton is just fantastic.We stayed in a two bedroom apartment in April 2007. We arrived very early about 6am, on a flight from Singapore. The security guard was pleasent and got us towels and soap etc so that we could have a shower. Looked after the bags etc. We found the check in staff alright, not over friendly but got the job done.Apartment was on 68th floor WHAT a view, it makes you break out in a cold sweat until you get used to it.!!The apartment was spotless, cleaned every day and all the washing powders, tea etc replaced.The area is within easy walking distance of Darling harbour, and although the street outside is a little run down we never felt there was a problem. Easy supermarket under the block for all food needs, plus loads of take aways and alot of Chinese food really near.We had no problem with waiting for the lifts, and would say that this appartment was one of the highlights of our trip to Australia. I cannot praise it enough!!

<Content>Great Value, Great View Just returned from a short stay in a 3 bedroom at the Meriton World Tower. Found the view, location and room absolutely fantastic. Had no problems with waiting for the elevator. Lots of eateries just steps from the hotel. A great room, especially for the price.

<Content>Wonderful Time In Sydney We're just back from travelling in Australia. In Sydney we stayed in the World Towers Apartments on 69th floor. Awesome views from floor to ceiling windows and high speed lift. Cost 300 dollars for two nights for a 3-bed apartment. Apartment beautiful and staff very helpful giving directions, information etc. Walking distance to Darling Harbour where we had dinner at the Meat and Wine Company which was excellent. We did trips to Manly on the ferry and went to Bondi on the bus. Excellent services which run on time and are inexpensive. Found a great shoe shop at Bondi in the main street. Loved the Sydney experience and will go back to climb the bridge next time. Didn't realise we had to book in advance.

<Content>Excellent spacious rooms We stayed in a two bedroom apartment with our two kids aged 6 and 10. This was ideal for a family as the apartment was very spacious, modern and clean. Our apartment was on the 66th floor with a fabulous view over the city and harbour. There was a small glassed in room with comfy chairs for taking in the view. The kitchen was well equipped with dishwasher, microwave, oven and cooktop and there is a fully equipped laundry. There were two very clean, spacious bathrooms. The king size bed was slightly too firm for my liking but otherwise hard to fault the room. People have complained that the elevators were too slow and at times they were a bit of a wait but we didn't think it was a problem at all. The location is a bit too far to walk to opera house, bridge etc. but very easy to walk to George Street and jump on a bus. There is a supermarket under the hotel to buy provisions. We paid $250 a night for this apartment which we thought was great value. We also recommend the room service pizzas - excellent.

<Content>Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!!! I was staying in Australia for just over 2 weeks visiting family in Port Stephens NSW. After a week in Port Stephens I decided to head down to Sydney for a trip down memory lane as I had previously spent 7 months in Sydney some 18 years previously. From reading previous reviews on Tripadvisor, I decided to stay at the Meriton World Tower apartments but by the time I had got round to booking it in Feb the price had tripled! However, I managed to get a good deal on a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment a few days before my arrival in Sydney on 7 March. I just wanted a 1bdrm apartment but there was only the 3bdm 2 bathroom apartments left which I went ahead and booked as the price was reasonable. On arrival I checked in no problem and was told my apartment was on the 71st floor. I could feel my ears pop going up in the lift. As soon as I opened the door I thought wow! The apartment was wonderful, I slept in the master bedroom which had an ensuite bathroom with jacuzzi bath which I just had to try out! There was a great , well equipped kitchen area, dining area, comfortable lounge area with TV and the whole apartment was fully air conditioned. There were also fantastic views of Darling Harbour. Meriton World Tower apartments are in an excellent location in World Square on Liverpool St, there is a monorail station virtually next door to the apartments and is also only a 5mins walk to Town Hall, QVB etc. My relatives were coming down to Sydney to meet up with me on the weekend. Unfortunately the price for staying at the weekend had at that point risen to $999 per night so I had to check out reluctantly. We checked in at the Formule 1 in Kings Cross and I can tell you that was an enormous shock after staying at the Meriton World Tower! However, we still had a great weekend.I would definitely recommend the Meriton World Tower to anyone wishing to be in a central location and I would most definitely stay there again.

<Content>The Best in Sydney! We booked 3 x 3 bedroom apartments and had an awesome time. Even though the check-in was busy, we didn't wait for long and all staff were very helpful. The rooms were amazing with beautiful views across Sydney. The living areas in the apartments are so spacious that all 18 guests could sit about and have a drink before going out. A great value and luxurious choice.

<Content>Great for the Money From the 63rd floor, the view from my room over Darling harbour was great.The double room suite was really cheap, and would be really be cheap for 4 people etc.The room facilities were fantastic compared to a hotel price.The location is fantastic, right in World Square so great for shopping. George street is close alongwith Chinatown and Hyde Park.

<Content>The Wow Factor We spent many weeks looking for a 3 bedroomed apartment in Sydney and decided on the Meriton for its central position. We read the reviews here - took note - and went ahead and booked.I have to say all six of us loved the Meriton - its views from the 75th floor were amazing. The lifts not a problem, we may have waited on one occasion 10 mins, but that was not anything to whinge about. The reception staff very efficient, polite - always.The apartment would definitely be one of the best we have ever stayed in - very clean, never heard any noise. The air-conditioner seems to be on a 4 hour timer, which could annoy you in the night during Summer. Would definitely recommend Meriton World Towers and we will be returning again...

<Content>Brilliant Meriton World Towers I have read some reviews posted which complain about the decor, reception service and lifts. All I can say is that a family of six stayed in a magnificent three bedroomed apartment on the 68th floor with spectacular views, they were immaculately decorated and cleaned every day, the reception staff were very very helpful and we in five days we never had any problems with the lifts. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.

<Content>Loved the Meriton Absolutely loved this hotel. Couldn't have asked for a more central place to stay in Sydney. Stayed there for 9 nights just after Xmas and took in New Year. Found it on the web and was delighted with the price. Stayed in a 2 bed apartment on 63rd floor with a magnificent view to the Anzac Bridge and Darling Harbour. Apartment was first class. Couldn't fault anything about it. OK, the lifts were sometimes slow, but that's hardly enough to put you off. Loads of bars/cafes/restaurants in neighbourhood. Would definitely recommend this hotel and if I were to go back, would have no hesitation in staying there again.Try the RSL Club round the corner from the hotel - cheap beer and great food.

<Content>Great views Just spent a night in a 3 bed apartment on 64th floor - booked over internet for $200 at the last minute for wedding anniversary. Very impressed - fabulous view, huge clean and well eqiuiped - suitable for longer stay... very central. Recommended as something slightly different. Dont know why everyone moans about the lifts - seemed pretty efficient!!! (parking is a bit confusing so plan ahead)

<Content>Great location  I stayed here for 4 nights with husband and 2 boys aged 6  11.The first room they gave us was a disaster. It was a disabled room which in itself is not the problem - it was the fact that it was very well worn. Chairs broken, walls scuffed, awful purple furniture and a dreadful smell in one of the bathrooms. We asked to change immediately, which was dealt with promptly.We moved to a room on 69th floor with views of Hyde Park. The colour scheme and standard were so much better - considering we booked direct and well in advance you would think they would allocate the better rooms to the full paying guests?? A woman who checked in when we did and booked through Wotif.com was given a room on the 75th floor (not sure which view though). Being school holidays it was extremely busy. Previous comments about the lift I endorse. In fact, we left on the same day as the previous woman and she was probably one of the ones waiting for the lift the same time as us. However, when we did get to the reception desk the check out was quick. I do have one major concern about this apartment complex. We needed to leave our luggage in their locked room as our flight left later in the day. They just took us down to the room, opened the door and we put our bags in with everyone elses. No receipts - nothing to indicate whose bags are whose. When we returned they let us into the room to get our bags - well, we could have grabbed an extra one or two and they would not have noticed!! Other than this we found reception to be ok - not fantastic but it is not a luxury hotel - these are serviced apartments so you dont get the little extras. We would stay again. The shopping centre underneath is excellent, particularly the Japanese bakery which our boys loved.Walk to Darling Harbour, China Town, QVB, or $8.00 taxi to Circular Quay.

<Content>Great for what I needed it for, however... I stayed at the Meriton apartments for just one night with my 6 year old son. I booked last minute and it was as cheap to get a 2-bed apartment as a smaller one, so we went with the bigger, much to my son's delight, as he got to sample both the spa bath in my bathroom, as well as his own bathroom's facilities.The stay was the last night of our trip to Oz, as we had to head out to the airport early the next morning, and so we took advantage of the transfer system the Apartments organised (extra cost).All in all, the Apartments are fabulously positioned. The amenities are superb - I would have been happy to stay for our entire three week trip there, as full sized washing machine, tumble dryer, dish washer, cd unit, dvd player, tv, fridge, freezer etc. were provided, as were starter packs of dish washer powder etc. A wide range of shops, restaurants and attractions are literally on your doorstep, and the apartments are huge. The monorail is also close by, and all in all, the convenience factor was very high.On the other hand, the lifts/elevators are really inadequate for the numbers of people staying there. Reception staff are strangers to the idea of customer service, and has been mentioned before, do not have a sense of humour. Thankfully their input into my stay was minimal, and was far outweighed by the stunning views from the 70th floor, the facilities provided and the location of the Apartments. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Loved the stay at the Meriton A group of us (6 people) headed to Sydney for 4 days/3 nights. I booked the World Tower on a whim after realising nearly everything had been booked out (there was a boat show on). I must admit I was a little worried after reading some bad reviews but was pleasantly surprised when we arrived.The location was great, with everything you need at your doorstep. The markets are a 5 minute walk away, while there's a whole shopping complex located in the basement of the hotel! Everything is a short walk away, and public transport is available just outside the door.We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment on the 67th floor, very high up!! Wonderful views of Darling Harbour but I'd avoid it if you are scared of heights. The apartment was stunning, and bigger than my house! The master bedroom had an en suite with spa bath, and we especially loved the viewing room. The apartment is equipped with stainless steel appliances and laundry. Everything in the apartment worked perfectly. Although there was a remote missing (can't remember if it was for the TV or Hi-fi system). The pool (on the 61st floor) was great but I believe the gym was closed for maintenance (not that we planned on using it).I can't say much about the staff or service, we only interacted with them during check-in/out and once when we didn't know how to work the oven. On those occasions they were perfectly nice. The one bad experience we had was the elevator situation during check-out. We checked out on a Sunday, which I'd imagine is quite a busy day. We waited approximately 15 minutes for the first elevator to come and once it did only 2 of us could fit on it, so while my friends waited for the next one I went and checked-out. I waited in line approximately 10 minutes to check-out, and the others had still not arrived. This was a headache because we had a shuttle bus to the airport waiting for us. Luckily we had a nice driver who waited patiently. The others finally arrived downstairs after 30 minutes of waiting. This is no exaggeration. If they hadn't of had so much luggage I daresay they would've walked down the stairs. And while they were in the lift someone ended up with motion sickness as the lifts drop very suddenly from such a great height.All in all I loved out stay, our only problem was the lifts but this was 30 minutes out of a 4 day trip. I would gladly stay here again next time I'm in Sydney.

<Content>MAGIFICENT!!!! MAGNIFICENT IS ALL I CAN SAY.This place is great we have stayed in Sydney many times and would not stay anywhere else with our children. Our apartment was on the 76th floor with views overlooking Sydney from Darling Harbour to Botany Bay. We had a 2 bed 2 bath apartment, my ensuite was as big as a bedroom, there was also a study area a handy place to leave the ironing board up. Lovely granite kitchen with every utensiland stainless steel appliances. The lounge/dining area was very spacious, but the best part of all was the floor to ceiling windows which took up all exterior walls. Dont stay here if you're scared of heights! The only negative was that the bed was quite hard and the cause of a few aches and pains over our weeks stay.I was disappointed to find only 1 TVin an apartment of such luxury, a TV in the master bedroom would have been good and quite expected I think in this time, but never mind I went to bed and looked at my magnificent view of sparkling lights over Sydney instead.The apartment was serviced very well every day with towels being changed and coffee/tea topped up also. There is a Coles supermarket and bottle shop under the building which is very handy along with lots of other shops. You have to try 'PUFFYS'.Unfortunatly both private movie theatres were out of action due to technical difficulties, a little disappoining as the kids were looking forward to it.After reading other reviews before I left I was dubious about the reception staff, but found them to be extremly helpful and friendly, going out of there way to assist us with taxi problems and any queries that we had.OUT AND ABOUT , The zoo is a must for any family, the powerhouse is great for that rainy day, The Lowenbrau Restauant in The Rocks got our vote on best family restuarant for biggest meal , reasonable priced, great service and fun and atmosphere, Tony Romas does great steaks and massive ribs but the serice isn't too crash. For a great Pub lunch in a beer garden you can't go past The Orient Hotel in The Rocks or The Watershed at Darling Harbour.For something completey different visit 'Minus 5' at Circular Quay a bar made entirely of ice, they give you warm clothing , the kids thought this was great , being from sunny queensland they had'nt experienced anything like it before.We also bought an 'Entertainment voucher book before we left for Sydney and it more than paid for us and saved us a lot of money.

<Content>Great location but lousy staff Just stayed at the Meriton 3 bedroom apartments for 2 nights. Had a very average apartment for the price paid. Fantastic views as we were on the 72nd floor. But very rude and unhelpful staff. Were given very poor directions for the car parking and wasted a lot of time and then running late for an appointment. No room service available as they use an external cafe which was on holidays. A simple note on check in would have avoided dramas and aggravation. A video system which crashed when the movie was paused and could not be reset as only security staff were available. He was extremely rude with glib answers suggesting that this often happens and hung up on me! Never again for us. The views were not worth the rude and disinterested staff.

<Content>Fantastic apartment with terrible staff We stayed at the Meriton in a 3-bed apartment for 3 days to finish our trip to Oz and found the accommodation to be simply stunning. Excellent facilities, beautiful contemporary furnishings and every facility you could wish for.Every inch was cleaned to perfection, all 鈥淢iele鈥?electrical appliances and superbly appointed bathrooms, one with a large spa-bath as well as the standard shower.Maid service was excellent with all condiments and typical hotel items replaced daily 鈥?a godsend for most people who are out all day and not intending to use the facilities to the full potential.Just one VERY BIG gripe鈥?the staff. At check in, for assistance with location, baggage, in fact anything that was asked of them, we felt that we were totally putting them out. No smiles, laughs or will to give anything other than a nod or simple yes or no. To be frank, I don鈥檛 think I鈥檝e ever come across a hotel reception with such poor staff attitudes!That aside, our stay was in no way affected by their distinct lack of being  would definitely recommend the Facilities to all.

<Content>Nice Views Arrived at the hotel in my rental vehicle, extremely hard to find parking, but managed finally. Reception staff were less than helpful, day staff were worse.Got to the apartment on the 70th floor, very spacious with good facilities. Having a king size bed was a treat, away to buy one now!!Lifts were slow with only 3 out of the four working, but we weren't in to much of a hurry anyway. Apartments are in a pretty central location, so easy to get the train, etc.Parking is $30 per night, but is $26 cheaper if you were to pay public rates. Having the convenience for me makes the price worthwhile.On Friday night there were 2 wild parties going on in the Hotel one on the 66th floor, to which the police were called. The other was right above our room on the 71st floor. After 2 phone calls and nothing done about it I went down to reception and advised them that they do something about it NOW!!!!Within 5 minutes there was silence and not another sound came from above. Security had the 66th floor issue to deal with and as the aparment was being destroyed they thought it would be best to get that under control.......I agree totally.Apart from that we had a wonderful stay.

<Content>Really good value We stayed at the Meriton World Towers in October for a week and were really impressed with the standard of this accommodation. The one bedroomed apartment was much larger than we expected, with a lovely bathroom (excellent walk in shower) and a huge bed. We didn't experience any problems with smells or noise - in fact it was really quiet. I must admit - we also did not have a safe. We even asked at reception and they assured us that there was one, but we couldn't find it, now I know why!Sydney is not as large as we thought it would be and we found it easy to walk just about anywhere - we are in out mid-fourties and my other half has an injured leg.I don't think the area is too bad and we never felt uneasy or concerned when we were out and about, although I would say that the immediate vicinity is very busy. I would also say that I found food to be more expensive than I expected, for some reason I expected it to be cheaper than the UK.All in all I feel it was clean, comfortable and spacious. We booked through hotel.com and I was leased with the price.

<Content>Meriton done nothing for us We have just come back from a 3 week tour to Oz the highlight was supposed to be Sydney and the Meriton. How dissappointed we were. A more soulless hotel Ive yet to encounter. Reception staff barely smiled and just done enough. The room was quite nice but abolutely no view whatsoever. We were on the 18th floor in a 1 bed apartment. Every night we could smell what others were cooking also we got distrubed by people ringing us on the intercom who had been given the wrong number by security. No apologyNo safe in our room and when I queried this with reception they told us that they were only in 2bed and above rooms!!! Unbelievable.We would not go back to the Meriton. Didnt like the location at all and agree with another post that the area looked a bit seedy.We had a fabulous time in Oz and will go back but not to the Meriton.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic!! Oh wow! We stayed in a 3 bed apt on the 76th floor - it was amazing! With Dual aspect windows in the lounge and floor to ceiling windows with amazing views over Sydney in the 3 bedrooms, this was incredible. If you don't do heights well though, this definitely isn't the place for you, it's a very long way up!!Definitely a 5 star apartment. We had 3 king size beds, the apt was massive, with it's own laundry room, large fridge/freezer, dishwasher, tv/dvd, stereo, spa bath, walk-in wardrobes, and we only paid AUD273 a night - an absolute bargain!

<Content>Great amenties at a great price! Myself and a friend stayed here for 5 nights during the beginning of Oct. After much trawling around the web i decided on this place because of all the complimentry reviews and it didn't disappoint. We had a one bedroom apartment on the 20th floor, so we didn't have an AMAZING view, but the one we had was okay. The apartment itsself was fantastic, dishwasher,oven, microwave, massive fridge/freezer, cutlery and plates, cooking utensils, even your own washing machine and tumble dryer (which we took full advantage off having been in Melbourne and then Port Douglas before arriving in Sydney). The bathroom was very spacious with walk-in shower and bath, and the living area was great too, big TV, comfortable sofa and nice balcony area. The only downsides for me were the lack of TV in the bedroom (i like to watch TV in bed!) and the attitude of the people working on their reception area during the day. They seemed like it was way too much effort for them to even acknowledge you, let alone give you the time of day. But i will be taking this up with the Meriton directly. But apart from these two minor issues, i'd definately stay here again, there can't be many other places that offer you so much in way of facilities as the Meriton!

<Content>All Around Excellent! World Tower is an excellent choice! I had read many of the reviews on this site before booking my recent two-week stay with Meriton Reality at World Tower. My stay, in a one bedroom on the 36th floor, was truly excellent. I should mention the following:1. The apartment was spacious, very nice, and like new, with great balconys, furntiture, etc., and they provide more than enough clean dishes, pots, etc to make great use of the apartment while there.2. The room service I received was excellent. Daily they tidy up and provide more than enough new dishwashing and laundry detergents, towels, etc., and they often cleaned up thoroughly which even included doing any dishes that needed it at that time.3. The amenities were superb. I used either the gym, pool, sauna, or whirlpool every day and they were always available and had great views.4. The location was ideal. World Square at the ground level and beneath has lots of restaurants, markets, other shopping. I was also just a short walk to Darling Harbor, the Queen Victoria Building, Sky Tower, etc.The only drawback I saw is that parking can be expensive if you want to use a car ($30/day), no one ever did replace a lightbulb I had twice mentioned was out in my room entrance, and while the elevators are nice they can take some time waiting for one on weekends. All said, I believe it is a much much better value and location than what I saw for hotels at comparable prices. I would stay there again.

<Content>Great Apartments with the Best Views! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Meriton. We are a family of 5 and we had a 3-bedroom apartment on the 75th floor. The apartments were so spacious and well laid-out so you get to enjoy the awesome views! Loved the kitchen, very modern and well-furnished. The best part was the main bedroom, oh so huge, great views and lovely bathroom, used the spa a few times.Pool and gym were ok, but I think the cardio machines in the gym should be facing the windows so you get to enjoy the views instead you're facing the entry to the gym or facing the wall, not very well-thought of. Must have been arranged by someone who does not really use the gym! :)The entire time we were there we did not experience any problems with the lifts, I was kind of expecting for it to be slow from the previous reviews but it was always there in a flash! We loved the location as well, central to everything, can't wait to go back next year!

<Content>Great family stay - highly recommended We put up at the Meriton while in Sydney for a family wedding in July 2006. We rented for just over a week in one of the larger corner 3-bedroom/2baths apartments as we were with our 3 kids. Ever tried a hotel holiday with children? Uually you end up frazzled, fighting and heavily out-of-pocket to sleep in 2 small adjoining rooms with many hotels still treating kids like a problem not a customer. Here we had an enormous city centre apartment with wifi, huge living/dining area and a well-equipped kitchen and laundry. I know some folks seem to have an issue with the lifts and I agree at peak times there can be delays but hey, for the views alone, if you're not a busy business wo/man you can bear a few minutes wait. Great facilities - we regularly used the pool and gym (tip: our kids were too young to last the full wedding so we bought some DVDs locally and booked the little advertised and no-charge theatrette for a movie show. Big cheers all round!). You could not get a better central location with the monorail on your doorstep, a cab rank outside and the metro a few minutes walk. The nearby foodcourt en route to the Woolworth's in the basement of the shopping mall is great and we ate some of the best sushi we'd ever had. Some nice Spanish restaurants down the street too. Walk a few streets further and find the charming Chinese peace garden - a big hit with our girls. We were very pleased with our apartment which was an ideal base for our family and great value. We booked the previous night as our flight landed early morning - a good idea if concerned about longer check-in times at peak hours/dates. We most definitely will be back.

<Content>Spacious and Views!!! We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment on the 64th floor and wow! the views were magnificent. We looked out onto Darling Harbour and even though the weekend poured with rain, the views from the windows were still fabulous day and night. The beds were large and comfortable and the bathrooms spotless with a large spa bath in the ensuite put to good use.My husband enjoyed the indoor pool on the 61st floor and gym area. Location was excellent, a five minute walk to Darling Harbour which is where we headed for an Expo, then a quick detour to Hay Market and Paddys markets. All within walking distance. We had no problems at all and found the security guard to especially helpful on our departure when asked for directions out of the city he found us a map and marked exactly what roads to take. We can't thank him enough! Great weeked, recommended 100%

<Content>On Top of The World We wanted to do something special for my husbands birthday when we discovered these fabulous apartments on Wotif--. For $229 we had a 2 bedroom apartment on the 63rd floor!Contrary to what I've read on previous reviews the lifts were fast and efficient and the accomodation was as spectacular as the view! We were lucky enough to get a corner apartment which is the only way to go, we passed an open door and saw a not so spacious, also 2 bedroom place, which for me personally, would have been the make or break of a great getaway.The main bedroom had all the comforts of home incuding a TV with foxtel, with the added bonus of an ensuite spa, while the second bedroom had a better view and second bathroom close by,it felt like a fair hike to walk to that area of the apartment and had the echoing drone of the dryer in the nearby internal laundry. I hope this paints the picture of just how large this place was!My husband and 4 year old daughter were impressed with the pool and spa recreation area on level 61, while I watched my 9month old son exhaust himself crawling all over the apartment. The kitchen was the only area compromised for space but impressive nonetheless. Beautiful appliances were put to good use with TV dinners purchased from the Coles supermarket located in the shopping complex downstairs. The staff were pleasant and helpful. After checking out we were able to leave our car in the carpark until 1pm while we caught a monorail (also on site) to Darling Harbour.I would recommend this place to everybody! It's central to Sydneys fabulous shopping, Chinatown, great restaurants- checkout the restaurants underneath, the movies, great pubs and is a monorail ride away from Darling Harbour.

<Content>Spacious, clean, busy I booked a 2bedroom apartment for 4 adults using Meriton central reservations after reading reviews on here. I was looking forward to a high floor with a great view unfortunately we were allocated level 19 (apartments start on level 18) where the view was average - mostly of city blocks, nothing like some of the views level 50 and above would get.The apartment was modern, nicely furnished and spacious enough - bathrooms and kitchen were clean.The lobby / reception area was busy any time of the day or night - mainly with asian students. They weren't noisy or annoying at all - there was just a lot of them. I suspect most of the building is long-term residential with only a small portion controlled by Meriton for serviced apartments.Overall I was happy with the place - although a little disappointed with the view. Next time I would pay extra for the 'high-rise' part of the building.

<Content>Very impressed I made the booking from NZ in April with info obtained from tripadvisor and brochures.When we arrived because it was only mid morning our bags were put in a security lock-up due to our room not being ready.However later in the day when we did return to the Apartments any delay of checking-in was quickly dispelled when we saw our fabulous 2 bedroom apartment on the 70th floor.It was clean, spacious, uncluttered with modern decorating and views Wow!I had read reviews about the lifts not working or slow. This however did not happen to us even though we were there for four days and used this resourse at numerous times.We liked the security requirements that were in place for the lift and foyer and the strict policy of no parties and that noise complaints would be handled swiftly.The staff we mainly dealt with were the check-in staff and they were more than helpful so I thank Shayne and his collegues for their patience of our ongoing enquiries.The mono-rail quickly became our best friend and is right next door along with coffee and a wide range of food outlets. For train travel and passes again a five minute walk.We also used the parking area on one occasion which was easy as and cheap.The $10 shuttle bus back to the airport which I had heard about on the tripadvisor was great.

<Content>Central location Great location for visitors to Sydney and spectacular view. Restaurants close by (Oxford Street, George Street, Chinatown all wihin walking distance). We also managed to walk to the Sydney Cricket Ground in 35 mins.There is a well-stocked Coles Supermarket in World Square, making it very convenient for essentials. There are also other shops in the complex eg. Rebel sport, SONY for instant printing of digital photos!Closest train station is Town Hall.One negative are the very, very slow lifts...especially when your apartment is up past the 70th floor!

<Content>Top view! Arrived tired to find that we were on the very top floor (77)....after fathoming the lift we found a huge apartment with amazing views over Darling Harbour. Couldnt draw the curtains each night as it seemed such a shame to waste the view.Location is pretty central, only 5 mins from the nearest tube and from Darling Harbour. Would highly recommend staying here + its cheaper than most hotels!

<Content>Beautiful Room Beautiful Room - views were lovely and the rooms were so spacious. The enclosed balcony was also an added bonus, as were the heated towel racks in the gorgeous bathrooms. Pool had a magnificant view. Cant complain about the actual hotel at all. Although I must agree with some of the other reviewers of the service. It was appalling! I waited a good 20 minutes to even be acknowledged at check in. If they can clean up their act with the service, then I would truely classify this as a 5* hotel.

<Content>Pleasantly suprised We were staying with out of country guests and were very interested in a room with a view. As such, we were willing to take a gamble on slow elevators, no air conditioning and poor service. (as noted in other reviews)We stayed on the 74th floor and never waited for more than one minute for an elevator and the air conditioning made a native Minnesotan put on extra layers. (Sydney was sunny and mid 20's both days) I could see how check-in queues could get long based on the desk staff numbers but this was not an issue when we checked in at 4pm on a Sunday.The 3 bedroom apartment was VERY spacious for 4 adults and 2 children and the pillows and beds were extremely comfortable. The kitchen was well fitted and even included plastic storage containers. At $273 AUD a night it sure beat 2 hotel rooms.The complex is less than a 10 minute walk to Darling Harbour and had a Coles grocery store and liquor store at the end of the block.The view was also spectacular.

<Content>breathtaking views over the harbour! What a fabulous place, the views from our spacious 2 bedroom appartment were breathtaking. We stayed on the 68th floor in a corner suite overlooking Darling Harbour. If you suffer from vertigo I would suggest staying on a lower floor. The floor to ceiling windows gave a 180 degree view over the most beautiful parts of Sydney.To state that the apartments were over sized was an understatement, definately plenty of room for 4-6 adults. The king size beds were so comfortable and the linen lovley. The spa bath was a welcome treat at the end of a long day shopping and sight seeing.The Merriton World Tower is ideally situated with shops, cafes and restaurants at your doorstep. The monorail was an excellent addition to the tower and makes for easy getting around.Overall I would say that it was the best place we have ever stayed in. Our 2 night stay for 4 people was extremely cheap at $180 / night(this was for Tue Wed night).

<Content>great views but poor service Had a 2 bedroom apartment - Good points: spacious and great views on 76th floor. Near monorail.Bad points: Lifts very slow and were malfunctioning nearly every day of our 4 day stay. Airconditioning was horrific in the apartments (there are no windows that open either so it gets like a sauna) and speaking to people in the lifts, they all had similar problems. Housekeeping does an extreme minimum and didnt come one day at all(regardles of calls to the front desk). Several people had moved into new rooms after constantly complaining and it was hadpresssed to find some one satisfied. Even the service people told me yes, its like this all the time but noone really fixes it!Quite sad as it could be a great sucess but 9 out of 10 people we met at the hotel said they were disapointed and would not come back.

The staff were lovely, always polite, friendly and full of advise. Felt like home away from home, much better than a little hotel room. I would stay again and recommend it to anyone looking for accomodation in Sydney.

<Content>Very VERY BAD service Disgusting service! receptionists are rude and arrogant. We had booked the hotel online and there was no mention of $500 bond per night, when I told them that I was not informed they said it's not my problem because I had booked online. They choose to have an option of online booking service yet they claim that it's third party and it is not their problem. I wanted my deposit back and go else where but they said they had to charge me $400 for first night before i have even checked in. The rooms are dirty, nice view but hair was everywhere, in the bathrooms on the sheets, it's disgusting. Should NEVER stay here.

<Content>Utterly disgraceful Not being a person who usually complains I would just like to say that my stay in the Meriton World Tower Appartments is my worst experience ever in any hotel I have been to anywhere in the world. I was extremely disappointed after looking forward to this accomodation so much. We had problem after problem and not a single apology from any member of staff. There on the 3rd night of my honeymoon, my wife and I were made to feel utterly insignificant and not the least bit valued!We would have overlooked any of our problems individually but we had so many it was disgraceful.1. We were told there was only one key for the appartment, the other had been broken (not a problem in itself but read on)2. We were 'not' told that when we opened our appartment door there would be two rooms, an A and a B. When I opened room B (not knowing which was ours) I found there was already a person there asleep on the sofa. This was not our room yet our key opened the door!!3. When I went to speak to someone at reception about this (clearly worried that other people could also get into our room) I was told 'Oh that would be so and so, he's alright, he's been here 10months.' Why would I be interested in this - I wanted someone to check the locks - nobody would do this initially.4. The appartment itself did not match the description we were given in any way. Quote The apartments are spacious and are 5 times larger than most hotel rooms. The room was like a shoebox and certainly not 5*!5. There was supposed to be a policy of keeping music down. Meriton warn that people making too much noise will be removed without a seconf chance. This was clearly not enforced as we had a neighbour blasting music during our whole stay there even after bringing this to the attention of reception.6. After going up to have a swim we decided to have a shower. Unfortunately, the shower door was broken and we could not use this as it would have flooded the tiny bathroom. When we brought this to the attention of reception somone did fix the door but we had no apology and he said this happens often. I thought this was meant to be 5*?7. While the guy was up fixing the shower I managed to convince him to try our key in our neighbours door. He didn't believe us at first but sure enough when he tried it the door opened. We were told they would check it out but not to worry - they were 'sure' nobody could open our door.8. 9am the next morning... We were woken up with a guy with a suitcase standing in our doorway looking very puzzled! This was another guest who had been given the other key to our room (we were told it was broken - see point 1) and sent to our appartment! When we mentioned this we were told 'You're not having a good time at the moment are you?'. No apology!9. I placed a towel on the towel rail (no force at all) and the rail came off the wall!10. After trying to ignore all of this and stay positive we went to book a taxi to the airport. Would anybody book us a taxi? No, we were told 'If you just cross the street over there you'll be able to hail one down easy enough'. It took over 10 minutes to get one! Not something that you would mind if you had paid for cheap 2/3* accomodation, but in 5* appartments you would expect some assistance.Utterly disappointing! I just hope that this was a one off and that other guests staying here have not had to endure a similar experience.

<Content>Hugely Disappointing For my wife and I, service is often more important than the room we are in, and at the World Tower the studio room we stayed in was indeed fine but the staff were the rudest we have ever met. Having booked 4 nights over the internet we turned up to be told we had only booked two nights. Our initial confirmation we had been emailed had no dates on it but the new confirmation had all the dates on it - very odd and not a good start. Having paid for another two nights by credit card, doubling the price and making it not good value, we recieved a visit to our room a couple of nights later by what seemed like two members of the chinese mafia, but who turned out to be two members of staff. After telling us our credit card was not being authorised (they took down the number wrong) and complaining they had been phoning our room all day and we had not been answering (the phone turned out to be broken), without an apology they left, just as I did two days later, hopefully never going back.If you are a couple stay in a downtown hotel in Sydney for the same money - this place is not worth the hassle - it was the most disappointing aspect of our round the world trip.
