<Content>OK, Not What I expected. I stayed at the Chesterfield on December 26th for two nights. Check in was no problem and the room size was what I expected. The bed was a king as requested and was one mattress, not two pushed together as in so many other hotels. The bathroom was tiny also. It was difficult to take a shower as the floor all over the bathroom got soaked. The negative things I experienced were that on the first night after my transatlantic flight I woke up at 3 am and realized there was a radio on somewhere right outside my room. I thought this unusual as the room faced the back of the hotel and just looked over the roof of the restaurant and the conservatory. But it was loud enough to keep me awake. I phoned the reception desk and was told it would be checked out. Nothing happened. After about 20 minutes I looked more carefully outside the window to try to determine the location of this radio. There were lights on in what looked like was part of the hotel's kitchen and I saw the radio placed right next to a window. I phoned the front desk again a little more persistent this time and told the clerk that I thought the radio might be in the kitchen. Again he said he would check it out and a few minutes later it was turned off. Someone evidently was careless and left the radio on. Also the remote control for the television was not working and needed to be changed.The room was clean and the staff were pleasant but it is not in the category that some on this site have said, especially by North American standards. It looks a little worn out, especially for Mayfair. For the price though it was decent, but do not expect a luxury hotel by any means. Ate in the restaurant the first night and the staff were very pleasant and tried their best but the food was mediocre at best. All in all decent, but not worth the hype.

<Content>Could not be better We stayed for 11 nights at the Chesterfield that included New Years Eve. We stayed for 11 nights because we got an amazing deal on a website that offered a number of free nights with our booking. The fact that we had paid less than the normal rate had no bearing whatsoever on the courtesies that we received from everybody at the hotel. The service was just brilliant. Clearly, management has instilled in the staff that they are in a service business and that the customer is their lifeblood. The staff responded superbly. There was not a hint of stuffiness, and they responded to all our requests with a smile and efficiency.Our room was small, but very functional and had many luxuries, including free coffee and biscuits; free bottled water ( a rarity in the States) and extremely luxurious bathrobes and towels. The bathroom was small, but, again, very functional. We had dinner in the very stately dining room on two occasions. The hotel and its public spaces have a very clubby feel. They are mostly dark woods with an old world charm. The food is well prepared, but not spectacular. Again, though, the service is top notch. They simply could not do enough for you. And, the bar area and the bartenders are extremely engaging. After watching the fireworks over the Thames on New Years Eve, we came back to the hotel for a drink in the bar. It was packed, but the bartenders on duty made sure that they found a space for us and served us without undue delay. The location of the hotel is fabulous. It is about a five minute walk to the Green Park tube station and a ten minute walk to Oxford Street. If walking is your thing it is about twenty minutes to Picadilly Circus and about the same to Trafalgar Square. It is actually only about thirty minute walk to Harrods. All in all, the hotel lived up to everything that we could want in a hotel. And, for Mayfair, the prices are downright reasonable for the rooms as well as the restaurant. What a great place!

<Content>Very Good We have just had a very good three night stay in the Hotel, we were very happy with every aspect of the experience, from the initial contact and booking to the car parking and porter service.Various people have praised the staff, I can only add to that praise, it is quite refreshing to visit a Hotel that have staff that really care.The only minor grumble was that the shower in the room was fairly useless.We will use the Hotel again.

<Content>Absolute gem. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived so we were treated to complimentary drinks in the bar. Our room had everything we required even a little note saying we could request fresh milk from room service, we did this and within the time it took for the kettle to boil our fresh milk had arrived, a small but very welcome detail. We were celebrating our tenth wedding anniversary and decided to eat in the Butlers restaurant on the 30th, the a la carte menu was unavailable due to the fact that much preparation was required for the following night but that didn't detract from the tasty dishes we chose from the set menu. Time constraints meant that unfortunately we couldn't try their Afternoon Tea, voted bested Afternoon Tea two years running by the Tea Guild, this alone will make us return. Every single member of staff was pleasant and courteous and seemed proud of the fact they worked there.

<Content>Nice hotel but not worth the hype I stayed at The Chesterfield with my husband during the Summer and found it disapointing. Having reviewed their website I was very excited about our stay especially when they sent me a form to fill in prior to arrival listing all of our likes and dislikes - it really set the expectations high.The hotel is beautiful, and farily exclusive, and all the staff are very polite and attentive but the wow factor that I was expecting just isn't there. We were in a suite which was beautiful, but after all the hype of the website and the guest preference form the fact that it was just an overgrown hotel room was a massive disapointment. The room had two ensuite bathrooms, a huge bed and the usual bathrobes and slippers but that was pretty much it. All of the gifts and modern technology that you were set up to expect just weren't there, I dont think they even had satellite television.My husband and I dont eat fish as we stated on the guest preference form so were disapointed when the (small) tray of complimentary evening canapes was brought up and was both cold and 50% fish items. The list of drinks, films and music we liked that we were asked to give to them was a complete waste of time.We had afternoon tea while we were there which was lovely, the 'chocolate lovers' tea was especially good though the room it is served in was cold and lacked atmosphere. Compared to other afternoon teas in Mayfair, such as at the Lanesborough, it really wasn't a grand affair.Overall it was a pleasant hotel and we had a nice stay, but I would definitely choose the Grosvenor or somewhere a bit more flashy if I was looking to be wowed, especially at Mayfair prices.

<Content>Oasis of Calm We have stayed at this hotel on two occasions and have just booked to stay again. The location is fabulous - within a 10 minute stroll to Oxford Street but situated on a blissfully quiet street. The staff are charming and professional - you genuinely feel like a valued guest and nothing seems to be too much trouble. We were up graded to a superb ( recently refurbished ) room on our first stay - a large , beautifully decorated room, exceptionally quiet, clean and comfortable. On our second stay the standard room was smaller but still adequate, clean and quiet. We have only eaten breakfast in the restaurant( - the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs were superb ) but look forward to the opportunity of eating in the restaurant.

<Content>New Years at the Mayfair We are on a mid-winter trip to Europe with 5 nigts in London. I booked the Mayfair directly with the hotel - they had a very reasonable price for a 5 star hotel (just under 200 UKP / night). The hotel is 'old world bijoux' with al the usual amenities for a hotel of this caliber. The rooms are not large -- and just a bit cluttered -- but very comfortable indeed and well placed just 2 blocks from the Green Park underground station. Berkeley Sq. is a block away (you can go see the Bentlys there). All the public parts of the hotel are finished in dark wood and they give the appearance of quiet refinement. As an example of what to expect at the Chesterfield, I had a strange yearning for hot incemeat pie all day (having seen an ad for this somewhere in London),l and at the bar last night, over a Pimms cup, I asked if they could bring me a slice. After some scrambling around, they did indeed produce a slice of hot mincemeat pie.Tom and Bob Scottsdale AZ

<Content>Outstanding! Booked this wonderful hotel for a weekend break in December - from the moment my wife  I arrived we were treated like royalty. I had booked the hotels weekend package which included a bottle of champagne and complimentary afternoon tea. To our surprise and utter delight we were upgraded to a suite. The standard of the room was exceptional and all that you could need was provided.Dinner at Butlers was a quality experience and throughout our stay the staff were extremely helpful, courteous and professional. For a real treat would recommend this hotel whole heartedly.Luxury at its best!

<Content>Loved everything from the very first to the last minute! Together with our daughter and our son-in-law, my husband and I spent an absolutely lovely long weekend at the Chesterfield Mayfair. Staff is extremely friendly, the rooms are charming, breakfast is generous and Afternoon Tea in the Conservatory splendid. You can spot the red carnations everywhere, they are a beautiful decoration. We had such a good time with you and we will certainly return to spend another unforgettable weekend at your hotel, a real gem!Adrienne Fl眉ck

<Content>AMAZING GEM OF A HOTEL Wow, this is the most amazing hotel, I almost don't want to review it to let the secret out, but its such a great find that it deserves every success it has coming.I arrived at 7am on Christmas morning after the hell trip from Australia. The lovely man at the desk informed me that the single room I had booked was not available so early but that it was not a drama, he upgraded me to a double room and led me upstairs immediately. First, the technicalities: I booked on the hotel website, the weekend package, a single room. This cost 115 pounds a night plus tax, and included breakfast, a bottle of champagne on arrival, afternoon tea on one day, 6pm checkout, and various other things that are not advertised, as I found out along the way: free internet (both wifi and cable), complementary bottled water in the room, the ability to have your breakfast served in your room instead of the restaurant, a newspaper daily, lovely fresh apples scattered around the hotel, tea and coffee in the room, sherry in the foyer... This is a very very classy boutique hotel - the fact that all of these things are included in the room rate rather than one feeling constantly 'nickel and dimed', is exactly what a hotel should be. Along with the wonderful warm welcoming hotel staff, and the high standards of cleaning and furbishments generally, it made for a truly blissful stay. I have read some negative reviews of this hotel on this site but having now stayed here myself I would be inclined to attribute these more to the writers than to the hotel. for instance, some might say, looking out of the window to my room, that the view is bleak - down below are air conditioner fans. But if you look up you see an incredible view of regency roof lines, its amazing at dawn and dusk, to see the horizon over such a view. And the rooms are no doubt small - as are all old hotels in England and Europe generally - but rather than finding this a negative, I find it charming and amazing at how they have managed to make so much space available in such a small room - its really incredible.other things I noticed:the bed is blissfully comfy - firm but squishy at the same time. and the pillows are easily the most comfortable I have ever slept on and I have asked for the brand so I can try and track them down myself. There is a turn down service each night which is a lovely treat. They ask you to choose between feathers or not, and between duvet and blankets. the linens are top notch - deliciously crisp and yet soft and beautifully monogrammed. As are the towels, so thick and thirsty and soft. and the bathrobes... Instead of dumping your paper on the floor each morning, it is placed in a canvas bag and hung from the door knob - I am sure that that attention to detail is appreciated by the older guest who finds bending down a challenge.the water pressure is amazingly strong - and wonderfully hot.there is a safe (digital, free) in the wardrobe which was the right size for my powerbook although I never felt the need to lock it away and just used it for my passport and jewellery.the location! I have never stayed in Mayfair before and now I can not understand why not - its a ten minute stroll to Regent Street to the right, ten minutes up the road to Oxford Street, 5 minutes below to Piccadilly, and five minutes in the other direction to Park Lane. Everything you could want right on your doorstep!the ability to have the breakfast included in your roomrate, served in your room, is just a really special treat. I have never stayed anywhere where that was the case, and being able to eat brekkie in your PJs while reading the paper, instead of having to get dressed first, for me, makes a holiday. hurruh!!So, to me this hotel is an amazing find and it is very hard to leave. I am staying at one of the sister hotels (the one near the palace) at the other end of my trip, and am slightly concerned because I now have such high expectations!!OK, I must stop raving and actually go check out!

<Content>Shopping and Christmas stay We booked two rooms for a 4 night stay, just prior to Christmas. My wife and two children (18 and 22) The hotel is located in Mayfair and is so convenient for Oxford Street, West End, Hyde Park The service was excellent and the staff very, attentive and respectful. It was like steeping back in time when tradition and values mattered. We all enjoyed the full breakfast and afternoon tea. My wife can only eat gluten free food, which the chef aways provided and which was always to the highest standard. I would recommend this hotel as a throughly English establishment, which provides super service, in a great location

<Content>Afternoon tea Visited this so British and stylish hotel for afternoon tea. Would have been great to stay too! Wonderful light scones and strawberry jam and delightful cakes. The only disappointment being very plain and uninteresting sandwiches. Delightful staff and such a pleasure to be able to sit and chatter and not to be rushed out. We enjoyed the decor of the main restaurant and the stylish ladies' powder room which is usually indicative of a good hotel. We shall be back.

<Content>Very good hotel, although not quite perfect We stayed in the Chesterfield for one night to follow our office Christmas Dinner there.The hotel was very much as we expected it, being of a Regency style and with excellent attention to detail.In retrospect, the hotel probably wasn't the best venue for a lively group in their 30s and 40s, as it seemed the regulars were typically of a more sedate stage in life, and this was reflected in the bar after the dinner. While one barman was fast, efficient, and polite, the other we assumed to have been assigned to the bar from other duties and against his will, as he declined to utter a word to us all night, and met every order with a gruff, reluctant expression. It seemed the fifty or so people in the bar were beyond their service capacity, and at one point I waited over 15 minutes and changed position three times to try to place my order.However, they did have a reasonable selection of drinks, and those of us who ordered cocktails after our meal upstairs, said they were very good. The meal, although a Christmas Dinner and probably not representative of the restaurant, was a very traditional turkey dinner, and also good.The staff in reception were very helpful and friendly, reception itself was gorgeously decorated with a Christmas tree and real Gingerbread House, and our standard room was lovely, although small-as-expected, with shuffle-room only around the double bed, but this didn't feel oppressive at all. The bathroom was a decent size, with a walk-in rain shower. The bed was lovely, comfortably firm, and the linen, dressing gowns, towels, etc. were all very luxurious. Everything was perfectly clean, and the hotel well-heated even on the bitterly cold evening we were there.My only other criticism would be that the English breakfast delivered to our room was only lukewarm by the time it arrived: again, not a big deal, but for such a highly rated hotel, I expected more. Also, the man in the kitchen who took our order had trouble understanding my English, which again, is a minor frustration that I have accepted in many other hotels, but I wouldn't have expected here. I was slightly relieved to see our breakfast arrived as ordered. The fact that our rate included breakfast, and there was no charge for having this in our room, was a pleasant surprise.So, overall, the Chesterfield is a lovely luxury hotel, but probably more appreciated by those who are visiting the UK as tourists and specifically enjoy the Regency style. I was shocked that they would even employ such an unfriendly barman, but in all other aspects the service was good.

<Content>Terrific Stay in London We had a wonderful visit to London which included 5 nights in this excellent hotel. Our room was lovely and included all the extras one needs. The hotel was well located, a15 minute walk to Leicester Square, the National Gallery, etc.. It was also a very quiet area. Staff were very friendly and professional. Even though it was expensive, given we were paying in Canadian dollars, it was worth it and probably good value compared to other top hotels.

<Content>Wonderful for a romantic weekend in the Metropolis The Chesterfield Mayfair in Charles Street, just off Berkeley Square, in the middle of Club land, is a very beautiful, luxurious and traditional british style hotel.Reception: Very kind and swift staff! They will help you with all your needs. They will even help you with the shopping bags if you have that need.Room: We had a somewhat small room, so with two people and all shopping bags, the room got quiet crowded... The bed was also quiet small. With that said, the room was extremely clean, nicely decorated and quiet.Breakfast: They have a nice buffet with some different kinds of cheeses and charcuteries, youghurt, cereals, juices and danish pastries. They will bring coffe or tea and serve the cooked breakast to your order. Everything nicely made and swiftly served.Afternoon tea: The afternoon tea is very good. We were a bit unlucky that there was a big function in the conservatory so they had to squeeze in all guest in the restaurant. Due to this it was over-crowded and under-staffed. With that said I need to say that the staff were extremely kind and tried their best to make it up to the guest.All-in-all: Wonderful and I will be back!

<Content>Perfect room for single traveller I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for one night this week. I had just arrived at Heathrow, quite late in the evening, to be in the city for less than a day before taking a train north. I was travelling alone and had requested a single. My room was nearly the smallest hotel room I have ever seen, but it was immaculate and met all of my needs. The furnishings were beautiful, the bathroom handsome and spotless, and the staff was helpful in every way. Furthermore, the price and location could not be beat. I was happy with the Chesterfield in every respect.

<Content>Great apart from the smelly room Booked a night with my wife in a standard room on the 29th November. Check in was smooth and efficiant and the doorman and other staff were genuinly interested in us and offered their help. Unfortunately despite booking a no smoking room we were put into a smoking room and given that the walls of the room are fabric lined it was pretty smelly. We asked to move immidiately but were told there were no non smoking rooms available but they could put a room freshner in the room!! We had to put up with it which really spoilt what was a pleasant , decent sized room. How come that you cant smoke indoors anywhere in the UK anymore except, it seems in hotel rooms. Fairly good value but watch out when you book the room direct as they quote a net VAT rate which doesnt help if youre not there on business. Mark Sussex

<Content>There can't be a better London hotel This is our 4th visit to The Chersterfield and they never fail to surpass themselves.The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping, theaters and sights, we didn't need a taxi.The food is excellent and reasonably priced, with a breakfast to die for, although the conservatory is a little cold in winter. The pianist playing in the lounge is a perfect end to a good day. The staff are always helpful.Rooms small but big enough and very well appointed, we loved the music room (bedroom).We are a mature couple from the UK

<Content>Amazing! I'll be back! I decided to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair based on reviews that I read on tripadvisor, plus the value for what you get and the location. There is so much positive I could say about this hotel but I'll just name a few. The room and bathroom were super clean. The bedding and toiletries were of high quality which I enjoyed immensely. The towels were so cuddly : )! The service was impeccable, there when you need it but not intrusive. Also, I loved the staff in the bar too, they were fun to talk to and provided great service.One other comment, I travel a lot for business so get to interact with alot of staff at hotels. It was refreshing to see how the staff was playful and light hearted with each other. One day I was walking by the lobby and heard them singing. It was so nice to be on a break in London and feel the joy of others around me. What a statement without words, to be able to observe people enjoying where they work and with the people they work with. Seems like a happy place to work which was reflective in the service and experience that I enjoyed at the Chesterfield. Thanks for the wonderful time! Judy Becker, San Francisco

<Content>Always a pleasure! We stayed here last weekend on the Mayfair Weekends package and once again, were not disappointed. We have stayed 4 times previously, and it really was like coming home. The room was a king size and although it was small, it was perfectly formed. We came here from another hotel and whilst the other hotel room was much larger, it was nowhere near the same standard of perfection. It really is worth the extra cost. The staff are wonderful - so polite- and actually look interested in you. The breakfast is superb, cooked to order and there was an incredible buffet selection-you certainly would not come away hungry! We would like to thank all the staff for a wonderful stay once again and will definitely be returning.

<Content>Absolutely beautiful hotel I stayed for one night at the Chesterfield on my own as I had been invited to a swanky party in Mayfair on a Saturday night and decided to treat myself. I did, however, get a fantastic deal on a website called hoteldirect I think and got a beautiful yet small single room with breakfast included. I turned up on Saturday afternoon and have to say that my entire stay was memorable! The room was beautiful, the bed so comfortable and the bed linen elegant and fine. The bathroom was gleaming marble with lots of lovely goodies and a huge shower. I was on the 3rd floor and it was incredible quiet. On Sunday morning, I ordered room service for breakfast which was such a treat and delicious. I don't often have the need to stay in London, as I live near Richmond but the hotel made my weekend a weekend to remember! Thank you The Chesterfield!

<Content>The Hotel Chesterfield - a fabulous experience We stayed at the Hotel Chesterfield a few weeks ago and we are still talking about the wonderful time we had there.The rooms are beautiful with fine attention to detail. There were all the essential comforts one appreciates like a plush bathroom robe and slippers as well as the everyday essential such as internet access and business supplies.The hotel's restaurants and bar were top notch. My sister in law came in late one evening and we were delighted to find that the bar remains open late into the night and serves food for their guests. The food was quite delicious and very welcome after a long day of travel. We had a English breakfast every morning in the main dining area and tea in the conservatory. Every meal was well prepared and again there was fine attention to detail.Without a doubt the most impressive part of the stay was the dedicated and caring staff at the Hotel Chesterfield. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. They were truly concerned that our trip be a great experience that they planned every outing with us, helping us get reservations and play tickets and last minute cabs. On a particularly busy evening we were running late for the theatre and the usual line up of cabs were not in front of the hotel. The doorman said I should wait inside, out of the rain and he would get a cab. I was so impatient that I went outside and didn't see him. Thinking he went home I wasn't sure what to do. Just then a cab pulled up with the doorman in the back. He had run out to the busy main road to make sure I got a cab and made it in time for the curtain to go up. That is all you need to know about the staff. They are all fantastic!

<Content>London weekend This place is completly different in a good way from many others. Warm atmosphere with live piano music, old-fashioned design of rooms and public places, excellent staff and service make the hotel very special. What was the most amazing I found english porridge delicious for the first time in my life. The best choice for everybody who doesn't like big, modern style, simular to each other hotels. Natalia

<Content>Thoroughly recommended! My husband and I stayed for two nights at The Chesterfield Mayfair from Friday 14 November 2008; a special day as it was my birthday and our annual getwaway to London to visit The Good Food Show. We had stayed in many of London's good hotel's but The Chesterfield was one of London's most finest with exceptional staff and service. First impressions, we were greeted by an attentive Consiage who showed into a beautiful Reception, and assisted by a highly efficient and friendly Reception team. Alex checked us in and was totally professional, he made us feel extremely welcome. Coincidentally he checked us out and even remembered it had been my birthday!.Our room, like the hotel in general, was elegant and stylish. It had kept its traditional atmosphere and beautiful decor, still offering the latest hi-tech facilities.After returning to The Chesterfield late on Friday night, we were also greeted by a charming and interesting French Barman. The exceptional service continued at breakfast the following morning and there was a variety of dishes to choose from. I can recommend the grilled kippers with baby quails eggs ! We found The Chesterfield was located on a beautiful Mayfair street and easily accessible to the delights of Mayfair, Regent Street and Picadilliy, the theatres and Green Park tube station.The only problem we experienced with our stay was that it was not long enough! It was a fantastic weekend and a birthday I will most certainly remember!

<Content>enjoyed our stay at The Chesterfield My husband and I stayed at the hotel for a 2 night weekend break. We booked direct with the hotel and our rate included breakfast and afternoon tea, which we thought was extremely good value. The food was excellent, our room (a superior king) was very comfortable, and the marble bathroom with toiletries and robes was very luxurious The staff were helpful, storing our case on the Sunday because our train was not until late afternoon. The location was perfect for shopping and a trip to the theatre. It is also very close to Shepherds Market with its pubs and restaurants.

<Content>Perfection Our third stay at the Chesterfield and definitely not the last. Being Chesterfield regulars we know to expect extremely high standards, smiling staff and great comfort. Yet with each new visit we continue to be amazed at the attention to detail, the warmth of the service and the feeling of coming home at the end of each packed day in central London.One thing I would like to say to all those who comment on the room sizes - this is London! In our experience, the Chesterfield's superior king rooms are no smaller than their equivalent in other European city hotels. They are, however, better value for money and equipped to a far higher standard than those of any other hotel we have visited. I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending the Chesterfield Mayfair to anyone staying in London.

<Content>The Reviews don't lie! My wife  I stayed at the Chesterfield for 5 nights in late October to celebrate our Anniversary. We booked a superior King room directly through the hotel. The phone reservations were very easy  the follow up by the reservation staff was excellent. We were sent a form for our preferences  the attention to detail was great.The Check in was perfect but the room seemed quite small. I was promised another room in the morning but realized we did not need it as the space was more than adequate. We had a breakfast cooked to order every morning included in the room rate  the quality of food was very good. All the classic English breakfast items were available to choose from  the service impeccable. We also had one afternoon tea in the lovely Conservatory  a dinner at the Butler restaurant which were also excellent.The service was well beyond what I have experienced in any European hotel. The hotel has a feel of a very English house with beautifully decorated corridors and rooms. The rooms are appointed very well  the concierge, Chris, was fantastic at helping out with restaurant reservations. I would like to make a special mention of the location of the hotel which was perfect. It is within a 15 minute walk of most Central London landmarks, theaters  good shopping . It is a fantastic hotel in a great city.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Chesterfield! After reading the reviews on the TripAdvisor website - I thought I would try this hotel - as I like the Mayfair area. Stayed 3 nights (Oct 17-20, 2008). Both my girlfriend and I had a wonderful time - felt like we were coming home each day. The entire staff were very nice and couldn't do enough. The housekeeping was great.In room touches - a coffee press, coffee, wonderful teas, two types of water, cookies - all complimentary. Room was small, but efficient. Breakfast was very good, as was high tea . We had dinner twice at the Butler resturant in the hotel, too -service was excellent as was the food. Quiet neighborhood and a short walk to the tube and Green Park and Bond street shopping.

<Content>Comfortable and Friendly We have stayed at this hotel twice. On the first occasion, the Junior Suite we had booked was so small that there was insufficient space to unpack 2 suitcases, let alone set up a laptop. What was otherwise a very high standard in all the hotel departments was let down by the room size. This was not a Junior Suite at all, in fact it was no larger than a small single room. I wrote to the management after our stay, and received an immediate and apologetic response stating that they had now downgraded the description of the room in question and offered us a complimentary stay in another suite, which we took up in October 2008. The suite on our second visit was adequate in size, very comfortable with excellent bedding, separate shower unit plus full sized tub, plenty of hanging space and a pleasant seating area. I believe they may have 'upgraded' us to a full suite in view of our comments after the first stay.In every other respect, the Chesterfield Mayfair is a fine hotel, offering service levels well above the norm for London. The doorman parked my car, returning it punctually when requested. The room service was incredibly fast. The Butler restaurant served us an excellent dinner and the breakfast offerings were of the highest standard. If you are travelling 'light', I would recommend this hotel without hesitation, situated in a quiet and elegant part of London within an easy walk of the West End.

<Content>Great location in Mayfair I stayed at this hotel twice with a two week break inbetween. The first time, I was alone and was given a small room, I did not know where to put my luggage. When I checked in again two weeks later, having booked a romantic weekend package for me and my partner, I asked if we could receive a larger room and mentioned my earlier experience with the suitcase. The receptionist gave me the option to stay at a larger suite for an extra 40 GBP per night. I felt this was too much but then she offered another room for 20 GBP extra. Wonderful, I thought, until we got to the room. The Jungle suite was a quaint little smoking room. A strange smell put me off but I openend the window and did not think about this any further. At night, we shut the window due to the noise of the traffic. At 4 a.m. I just could not stand the smell any longer and detected a 'very strong and smelly' room freshener pluged in the socket. I unplugged it but a few hours later the poignant smell of old smoke in the curtains, wallpaper and carpet came out.We were lucky they could give us another room. Having stayed in 3 different rooms, I don't think I want to book that hotel again. The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times. We also thought that the afternoon tea was a highlight.P.S. back home I had to air everything I had along

<Content>Not as good as we expected We were finishing a tour of Europe and thought we'd stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair since we read such great reviews about it. The hotel was just not what we expected. It was a nice boutique hotel in a very posh neighborhood, but beyond that we did not experience the great service that others on this site have talked about. On the contrary, I found the service to be stuffy and not very friendly. We have not recommended this hotel to any of our friends who are looking for an amazing hotel in London.

<Content>Fantastic service Stayed at the hotel for two nights with my girlfriend. The entire hotel has a distinct English feel to it and is located in the heart of Mayfair, perfect for exploring the City.The staff went out of the way to help me procure a piece of jewelry - thanks again!Sumptious breakfast. Also, try the English Afternoon Tea, which was excellent. Would definitely stay again!

<Content>Great Location - lots of staff! We just returned from a two night stay at the Chesterfield and we were happy overall. We had 'The Mayfair Weekender Package' which includes champagne in the room on arrival, afternoon tea, late checkout.... Unfortunately we were put in a smoking room but did not realise this until we had unpacked and arrived back later that evening. We had not been asked about what would have been our preference which I thought was not good. The corridor did smell of smoke a lot and was not very pleasant at times but it was only for two nights so we didn't want to have to move. The room although nicely decorated was small and had a small window which over looked grey walls. I suffer a little from claustrophobia and to be honest found the room a little inhibiting! Staff were numerous and friendly although I have to say I was a little bemused to be asked, after check in, if we could manage our two cases ourselves! Not a great start.After that we had a nice stay until Sunday morning when I thought I should telephone reception to remind them of our 'Late Checkout'. We left the hotel at 1.30, leaving our bags in our room. We returned at 3pm to find we could not access the room, card was rejected. When I went to reception to explain this, I was told that it was standard 12pm checkout, I mentioned that I had confirmed this morning(part of 'weekender package').... I got no apology from this girl at reception, she just reactivated the card. Thought this was a bit rich. Yes the hotel is in a great location and is very comfortable and beautiful in many ways unfortunately we just got a few negatives along the way also.

<Content>A truly wonderful experience! I spent a long weekend at The Chesterfield Mayfair prior to going to a conference in Oxford and then returned there for a shorter weekend when the conference ended. Both times (separated by a week) were excellent. My room was a bit larger the first time (I believe I was upgraded) and I enjoyed the extra space, but the smaller room was just fine too. The staff was lovely and worked hard to accommodate my need to get into my room early, following an all-night flight from the US. When I couldn't get my computer to work (and panicked!), they sent the hotel engineer who was able to sort things out and was very kind and friendly. Breakfast was an absolute delight--including being greeted each time by name by the hostess after my first morning there. The tube stop was about 10 minutes away (but a lot of stairs!) and it was also easy to walk to places I was interested in seeing. There were fun extras such as a bottle of champagne in the room, the signature red carnation, and a complimentary afternoon tea each weekend I was there--so much food that I skipped dinner. I am looking forward to introducing my husband to this hotel when we can both go to London. It's charming, gracious, and in an interesting area of London. I definitely recommend this hotel!

<Content>Pampered Luxury My wife and I stayed at The Chesterfield in Mayfair earlier this month. We travelled down to London on the Friday evening and checked in late. Upon arrival the hotel staff were warm, friendly and extremely pleasant and efficient.Tired and with a big weekend ahead of us, it was important to us that we made the most of the weekend. We made good use ofroom service and again were impressed by the staff, not to mention the quality of the food.The room itself was well equiped and decorated nicely. Most things were catered for and compared with other similarly priced hotels in London, The Chesterfield offered a more spacious area that helped create that feeling of pampered luxury.Prior to our visit, I had organised for chocolates and flowers to be in our room upon our arrival. The hotel staff carried out this request perfectly and helped to make our stay a wonderful experience. Finishing touches, such as the fruit that was provided in our room, also helped to make our stay extra special.The hotel also provided us with the opportunity to cater the room for our particular tastes and requirements. As an allergy sufferer, I found the ability to order non allergenic pillows and duvets a welcome facility.The hotel is centrally located in the heart of Mayfair. All the staff proved themselves to be courteous and charming. The Hotel bar provided us with an ideal area for meeting our guests and later, for a relaxing drink in nice surroundings.The reception staff were extremely helpful and were able to make suggestions regarding our plans for the day and the Concierge were only too willing to hail taxis and help with luggage and all with a friendly smile and a warm manner, not something that is always on hand in London.All in all, I would thoroughly recommend anyone to experience the luxury of a few nights stay at The Chesterfield in Mayfair.We'll be back!

<Content>The outstanding Chesterfield We (my wife and I) stayed at the Chesterfield during a 3 night stay in London, in short we had a fantastic time the hotel lived up to its world ranking, it was outstanding. Everything about the hotel was 5 star apart from the staff who were 7 star, nothing was to much trouble and the pride they took in carrying out their tasks was evident through out. Yes you pay for what you get but unlike some other hotels, we left the Chesterfield not begrudging a penny we had spent during our memorable stay.

<Content>Fabulous London hotel My family and I stayed at the Chesterfield for 4 days last July. I must say it was one of the nicest staff we have ever met! From the moment we entered the hotel, 'till our departure, everyone was really nice ,corteous, and funny! They made us feel very welcomed. When we arrived, the manager noticed that we had a lot of luggage, and upgraded us to a much larger room. Very professional. The room was spotless clean and big. Breakfast was included in our rate, and it was good . The location is perfect, pretty close to Hyde Park, but in a quiet and charming neighborhood. Well-worth the price. The Chesterfield will certainly be our # 1 choice when we go back to London, and we hope it is soon! Thank you, Chesterfield, for a memorable stay!

<Content>By far, hands down, the best of the very best My family and I are extensive travellers, going to Europe/the US more than once a year. Our wonderful experience with the Chesterfield Mayfair is unparalleled and their exceptional, professional and courteous services began even before our arrival. This is going to be a long email, but they deserve it. When we first made our booking for a triple room, I contacted the hotel via email, asking if it would be possible to get a somewhat large room because my elderly mother was to be with us and she is a bit claustrophobic. As the triple room also did not have a minibar, I asked if it would be possible to put one at an extra charge. In less than ten minutes, I got an email stating that a larger room would be made available and a minibar included in the room FOR FREE. Once we reached the lovely and charming hotel, we were delighted to find that the hotel decided to give us a complimentary update to a junior suite for my elderly mother's sake! The junior suite was lovely, with all the amenities that one can think of. My mother requested an additional mattress because of her bad back. Again, only a few minutes passed and a charming member of the management team, Ms. Devlin, came to apologize that they do not have additional mattresses and for that, they are offering a COMPLIMENTARY single room on the same floor to my mother. We were speechless. This proved to be a sample of the wonderful, courteous and personal touches that mark everything at the Chesterfield. On a daily basis, you get complimentary biscuits, candy, tea, coffee, hot chocolate and bottles of still and sparkling water. There is free internet in your room and free access to the internet and a printer in the lower level of the hotel. The suite, as well as my mother's lovely single room had also: a hair dryer, pens, paper, pencils, earser, post it notes, ruler, sharpener and scissors. Basically, everything you can think of and need whether you are on a business trip or if you are there for lesiure.The rooms and especially the bathrooms are spotless clean and shower and bath gels, soap and lofas are replinished daily. On your way in and out, you are greeted with a smile from everybody asking if you had a good time, if there was anything they can assist you with, directions, cabs, suggestions for places to go, and they also alert you if the weather was about to change. The doormen always gave my mother a hand as she got on and off the cab. We once had dinner at the hotel restaurant and not only was the treatment superb, but a few days later (we stayed for a week), we ran into the gentleman who was serving us, and he remembered our names! Ms. Devlin also ran into my mother at the hotel's lovely library and was keen to stop and ask if she was enjoying her stay, if the liberary room temperature was comfortable, if she needed anything at all.One day, we found letters, signed by the hotel manager, alerting us that neighbors were having a party that could stay a bit late into the night, apologizing if this was a bother and assuring us that the hotel would make sure that the music would not extend beyond 10:30 PM. We thought that this was a very nice and caring gesture. But that was not enough for the Chesterfield; later in the day, we got a call again from Ms. Devlin relaying the same message and the apology. What really sets this hotel apart is the personal touch and the extra mile that each and every member of the hotel staff go through to make sure that you are comfortable and that you are special. As to the location of the hotel - unbeatable. Within minutes, and on foot you can be in Berkely Square, Piccadilly, Bond Street, Regent Street, Oxford street, Park Lane, the Palace, everywhere. There are loads of restaurants, shops, bars and cafes under five minutes from the hotel. A Boots and a Sainsbury are practically around the corner.Would I recommend the Chesterfield to anyone else? I already have to business associates and friends alike. What a lovely lovely place, wonderful people and the best choice for a memorable stay in London. Cannot wait to go back. Our enjoyment of London was to no small part thanks to the Chesterfield and their staff.

<Content>Great Hotel My Brother and I had just finished an eight day tour of Ireland which we enjoyed. When we got to London we were looking for a four day stay where we didn't have to change hotels or Bed and Breakfast location every other day. We both got our own room. The condition of the rooms were clean and decorated very well, (although small), staff was great and helpfull. It was a great location quite and handy for the Green Park station, within walking distance of Hard Rock if you needed a good hamburger, and in a good park of London. In short this hotel was one of the best we stayed at during our trip. In addition it was a great value.

<Content>It's all true. This place is great. What a perfect introduction to London. A small gem of a hotel tucked away on a side street in a lovely neighborhood. Very romantic. Lots of brocade, carpeted walls, and mirrors, mirrors, mirrors. Nice bathroom and amenities, competent staff, all together a real find.

<Content>All Class What a lovely hotel, we stayed mainly with family during our tour of England, but for our last night we splashed out.The service was fantastic, the food great and hotel amenities almost second to none.The rooms are on the small side considering the price you pay but the location makes up for it.If you have the cash, then you should splash out and spend a couple nights.

<Content>Intimate Hotel with Great Service The Chesterfield Mayfair remains my favourite hotel in London. The location is fantastic. The hotel is intimate and very British. The staff, especially the concierge Chris, go above and beyond the call of duty to make you feel welcome. Highly recommended!

<Content>Loved the Chesterfield My girlfriend and me were meeting in London for a pre-honeymoon and discovered that the best way to reassure what love is was by staying at the Chesterfield. Wonderful staff, courteous and extremely helpful for all those small details that you need in order to make your girlfriend feel the one and only. One thing that you need to know is that the Chesterfield is not the typical big, enormous spacious american-type of hotel. If you are looking for that, go to big polluting beach resorts somewhere in the Caribbean. At the Chesterfield you will enjoy a truly english exprience with charming decoration, clean bathrooms, excellent bar and cuisine, and a romantic and elegant atmosphere. Once I heard that the will be always an old, good England....well, I hope that in the future there will be always a Chesterfield in London.

<Content>Excellent hotel, great loacation,wonderful staff We have just returned from three days at the Chesterfield Mayfair, our second stay so far this year. It really is an excellent hotel in a great location with very pleasant, helpful staff.We had a package deal which included tickets to the Tutankhamun exhibition with an unbelievable picnic lunch to take with us, lunch on the first day and afternoon tea on the third. The service in the restaurant is impeccible, as is the food - don't miss lunch in Butlers.The room was well presented and comfortable with all the small touches one would hope to find in a top London hotel.We will be returning later in the year.

<Content>Excellent experience The hotel we usually book in London was unavailable so we did quite a bit of research and decided on a Red Carnation chain hotel. Don't be put off when I say chain - because we found the staff to be incredibly personal, the property outstanding both in location and amenities and the services excellent.The location is great for walking to all the great London shops and sights. The hotel is located in the best part of town and there is a wonderful pub right down the block.Be warned - the rooms are on the small side but very functional and the beds are quite comfortable. They even email you ahead of time to find out what type of pillows you would like and whether you prefer a duvet or blanket.Breakfast was included daily, which we took advantage of both in the restauarant and room service. The food is wonderful and the choices varied. We ate there 5 days in a row and didnt get tired of the choices.Hope you all have as good an experience as we did. The staff is wonderful.

<Content>Pure Class We have a London weekend once per year and routinely stay at the Chesterfield. Why?1) Never disappoints .. from check-in, to breakfast, to service, to help .. everything.2) Great location .... short walking distance to main shopping and theatre districts. But quiet location to enjoy peaceful night's sleep3) Reasonable price for London location .. always found it best to go direct to their website or management directly as they match best deals out there and often do their own (eg breakfast included, etc).4) Rooms (while small like most London hotels, especially the bathrooms) are immaculate/clean with all the little items being included (safe, fridge, coffee facilities, internet, etc). 5) Great management .. ask in advance what type of pillows you want, etc .. basically think about the little things. Always helpful when asked.Basically a great place .. tough to find negatives honestly.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great location What a wonderful start to 3 weeks in Europe. This is a lovely hotel in a perfect location. We walked everywhere. Could live in Mayfair - it is beautiful. Staff were fantastic, even watched Wimbledon Final with them in their lovely bar. Make sure you have a drink in the bar if you stay here as it is a great way to finish the day. The service here is outstanding. We arrived very early after a 23 hour flight and were able to have a room straight away. Throughout our time at the hotel staff were always pleasant and helpful. Arranged tickets to Hairspray the Musical for us (a must see - amazing show) and gave us great tourist advice. Would highly recommend this hotel especially if you are looking for a true English experience rather than staying in a contemporary chain hotel.

<Content>As good as the reviews said it would be We always look for a good place to stay when away from home. I use TripAdviser when deciding where to stay and it has never let us down. The Chesterfield was wonderful. We stayed for three days during a weekend and from the moment we arrived to the moment that we left the Hotel we were very well looked after. All the staff are friendly and easy to speak with. The restaurant food is very, very good. Our room was small but very comfortable with everything working as it should. AND they still turn down your bed at night, something that a lot of hotels have stopped dowing these days. A very nice touch. We will certainly be back again!

<Content>Great Hotel As regular visitors to London over the years and having been based there in the 1980`s and 90`s my wife and myself have progressively tried and tested a large number of the capital`s hotels.The Chesterield Mayfair ranks as one of the best and it delivers what it`s reputation implies. Located not far from Green Park Tube Station it is extremely well located for getting around the capital.On arrival the receptionist was welcoming and despite a slight glitch with our travel companies reservation details soon had us checked into our room.We were on the seventh floor in a room that was of reasonable size, tastefully decorated and clean and well furnished with plenty of wardrobe and storage space. The bathroom was small but certainly adequate. The bed was comfortable, housekeeping of a high standard and there was little noise from outside or within the building. The hotel provides the twin benefits of staying in a pleasant residential area with quick access to transport links and local attractions. There are plenty of cafes and sandwich shops close by if you want snacks and drinks to take out for the day.As we were either at shows or visiting attractions we dined out at night so only breakfasted in the restaurant which is light, pleasant and relaxing. The buffet was varied and plentiful and more than adequate for our needs so we resisted the temptations of the cooked breakfasts which did look appetising and well presented.On this trip we did not have time for leisurely dining out in town but for a light pre/post show meal, if you like Italian food, try Cappuccetto in Moor Street (just off Cambridge Circus). If you want to pay 拢19 for two coffees and two cakes go to Pompidou in Irving Street just off Leicester Square.On departure from the hotel we completed the guest questionaire and commented on the noisy room air conditioning, cold toast at breakfast and failure on two mornings to clear our used crockery. Within a few days of returning home we received a detailed letter from the General Manager confirming that these matters had been given careful attention. That is the good customer service for which the hotel is known.We enjoyed our stay and will certainly go again.

<Content>The Ultimate in Customer Service We arrived for a week's stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair and were constantly impressed and pleased by the extraordinary service that was provided. Everyone was friendly and made us feel quite welcomed. Our room was delightful, but a bit on the small side. The bathroom was more than adequate. Our experience in the bar and restaurant was similar; staff just seemed to really extend themselves to make you comfortable.This was our first stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. Our previous visit to London was at the Stafford (same general area -- much more expensive). We will return to the Chesterfield Mayfair. Great value, great location and a wonderful staff.

<Content>Great Location, Charming hotel if you get a nice room. My son and I just returned from a trip to London and Paris. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel was our first stop. I had emailed the hotel just after I booked our trip to secure a room with 2 double beds, seeing that I am traveling with my son. No problem, received a prompt reply, it would be taken care of. It was, however, the room we were shown first was drab, depressing and smelled. The next room we took for one night because there weren't any others, was equally drab and depressing, but we both slept well. The next day we were upgraded as promised, however they wanted to charge us $200 US for the upgrade. I told them if I was going to spend that I would check out and move to the Ritz Hotel. Didn't think the hotel was worth it at that price, an extra $200 per night. So, upon that they upgraded us to a suite for no extra charge. I was considering moving hotels...but the suite was lovely. The only problem was the noise of cars outside our window at night. It made sleeping with jet lag a little difficult. It is a lovely hotel if your room is nice, the suites are nice, the other rooms need a face lift. I found the concierge to be very nice and helpful. He recommended a restaurant nearby the hotel for a very delicious dinner, VERY EXPENSIVE, but I knew what I was getting myself into. Try The Greenhouse if money isn't an issue, wonderful meal, beautiful restaurant and walking distance from the hotel. A wonderful French chef.The bar at the hotel was cozy, great piano entertainment, however I do agree with another reviewer that said help in the bar is indifferent. It is though they are really doing you a favor by serving you one of their very high priced drinks--loose the attitude and it is a great hideout. Would I stay here again, perhaps, if I could be guaranteed a suite on the interior of the hotel. Great free computer use in the lower level, that was a plus, as I had some work to do.

<Content>Wonderful hotel with PERFECT staff We spent a weekend in London at the Chesterfield Mayfair - and if I could, I'd hop onto the next plane and head right back!Our stay at the Chesterfield was perfect in every way. First of all, the location couldn't be any better. It's easy to get around from Mayfair as the Green Park tube station can be reached within 3-4 minutes and the Oxford Street shopping area is not more than 10 minutes away.Moreover, the staff is truly exceptional. Everybody, from the doorman to the concierge, is more than willing to help you in every possible way. After checking into our room we found out that our bed was too short for my husband. Although the hotel was almost fully booked, an extremely kind lady at the front desk took care of our problem and accommodated us in The Study junior suite (what a wonderfully decorated room!) at no extra charge. Thank you once again!We had a traditional afternoon tea in the Conservatory twice - both times everything was incredibly tasty and we were offered more of all the things we enjoyed most. Again, the staff was perfect.Also, we stayed in for breakfast on both mornings and the choice and the quality of the food items on the menu and on the buffet is exceptional.I can recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair in every way. I'm sure even travellers used to very high standards will enjoy every single minute at this fabulous hotel!

<Content>Disabled Guest Review Booked through londontown.com after reading TA reviews. Family of 4 (2 teens, 2 adult - 1 in wheelchair) stayed 8 nights in 2 rooms. Yes, it was beyond nuts, I admit it right up front. but we wanted to be taken care of by a 5-star hotel. We really weren't taken care of as expected (see below), but it was a nice enough place to make our stay an enjoyable experience. As a disabled guest in London for the first time, I was glad that the hotel, as expected, is centrally located within a short walk of good breakfast  lunch places (Cafe Necco is excellent), the Ritz (Evan Evans tour bus pick-up location), Buckingham Palace, and London's extensive bus lines. The hotel doormen had to drag a portable lift to the doorway every time I entered and left the hotel. They eventually got used to the routine  were nice about it, but I still felt conspicuous. Lobby interior is inviting just like the pics, very British-clubby and elegant. Bar and restaurant are as nice as pics as well, but staff is a bit indifferent in the bar. Bathrooms are in the lower lobby and are not accessible at all. The hotel provided me with a lovely and quiet accessible room dominated by the king-sized bed, which had a very hard uncomfortable mattress and several too-soft pillows that made sleeping difficult. AC was loud but tolerable. Accessible bathroom had insufficient grab bars, and a sloped entrance ramp that made wheelchair access impossible without help, and the rickety tub chair was truly treacherous. Still I was very glad to have this room once I woorked out a system for myself - I used a manual wheelchair in the room, and switched to a rented electric one for outside use that I stored in the library at night. Hotel elevator (lift) was very small - I had to move the footrests back on the manual chair to fit inside, and it was a very tight fit for the electric one . Doormen assisted in retrieving  storing the ramp and wheelchairs but I had to get huffy with the night staff before they became more helpful. After they knew I needed them to be more pro-active in setting up the ramp, getting the wheelchair, etc., everything went much more smoothly. Still, I feel that for a 5-star, hotel, I shouldn't have needed to be assertive to get help (just with the night staff; daytime staff was usually fine). [Note: I found the London bus system to be very convenient to the hotel, and the busses were eminently accessible with excellent lifts.] Staff was not very helpful at all re: sightseeing and transportation tips and assistance, again, surprising for a 5-star hotel. I'm glad I'm self-sufficient and that I'd done all my own very extensive research in advance. Still an elegant small hotel in a very nice, safe neighborhood that makes a visitor feel very good. Prices are so ridiculously high (even though I'd been duly warned, the money drain was much worse when actually experienced) that your money gushes out of your hands like flood water - after 8 days in London I felt almost like it just didn't matter anymore, because I was so broke-what difference is another $40 breakfast of 4 bottles of juice, a small fruit container, and 2 muffins, anyway, after a week of crazy prices? Enough to make anyone punchy...!

<Content>Wonderful staff  We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff are really friendly and the manager provided complementary breakfast after some confusion on the booking, and then a free room upgrade as it was our 50th wedding anniversary. What more can you ask for.The hotel is well situated in the heart of London and the breakfast and evening meal were excellent. The room and bathroom were spacious and quiet.We would gladly come here again in the future.

<Content>Excellent! My family and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel for 3 nights in late June. The hotel was offered as part of a vacation package booked through Costco Travel. We were impressed with the level of service and cleanliness. The staff clearly aims to please its guests. Our room was small, but comfortable. The hotel provided robes and slippers. Amazingly, the bathroom mirror never fogged up after showers and the marble tiled floor was comfortably heated. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace and Picadilly Circus. The underground tube station is also nearby. The only drawback I can think of, is the hotel restaurant is very pricey......but so are many other things in Europe when purchased with the American dollar. Overall, this hotel is a gem!

<Content>NOT WHAT I EXPECTED! Stayed at the hotel for five nights the week of 30th June 2008.I stay in London hotels about 40-50 nights a year, in the recent past had have been staying at the Park City but decided as I had customers joining me to stay closer to town.The hotels location is a positive as well as the service and food, ordered room service a couple of nights and it was of a very high standard.I am staying in a suite which is the size of a normal king room; my guests stayed in king rooms which they all commented on were very small. The decor is absolutely not to my taste, over done and tired. The noise coming from the nightclubs or bars is not to believe, I am writing this review while I am still in the hotel at 23:30 and the din is unbearable, I can hear every word the DJ is bleating out. My guests also commented on the noise from the bars below their rooms, not a good impression when you are doing corporate entertaining. Overall a very disappointing experience will not be staying here again. Back to the Park City where you get a decent sized modern room and a good nights sleep.

<Content>A Ghost of a Beautiful Lady The Chesterfield Mayfair London has become a faded beauty, still interesting, but lacking a great deal.I've stayed at the Chesterfield many times and have had wonderful stays. I particularly enjoyed the elegant touches and the high levels of service. Now, the Chesterfield is more like a nice Marriott than a speccial lady. The location remains a postive. However, the new smoking terraces of the nearby pubs create a din from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM.My room was small, but filled with monsterously-sized furniture. The results was a feeling being in a flea market vendor's small shop. The bathroom was so small, that one had to take care not to hit the sink when exiting the bathtub / shower. The closets were ample, but access to them required a contortionist.What can one say about the price. While the Chesterfield is not blame for the weak dollor, the prices have increase over 50% from my last stay 2+ years ago. With the weak dollar, a commercial room was over $500 per day!The service staff was, at best professional. The old touch of the concierge and receptionists has been replaced by young, inexperienced people who do not suceed in pulling it off.The bar remains lovely with excellent service. Even the tennis ball that bought a round of drinks did not help reduce the sticker shock of a couple of glasses of house wine.Breakfast was very nice; however, it was so expensive that I lost my appetite.One might do a lot better at a Marriott.

<Content>Small rooms but excellent hotel Very centrally located close to Piccadilly. Arrived after midnight and met friendly and helpful staff. Room was quite small but it had everything; good bed, comfortable chair, wonderful bathroom with big shower in the tub and free wireless Internet access. Everything very well maintained, lots of dark wooden panels. Breakfast in the very nice Butlers restaurant, but price of 拢 22 is rather stiff! Buffet was not impressive but hot dish made to order was very good.

<Content>loved the chesterfield Just arrived back home after spending a wonderful weekend at the chesterfield. I booked it on the hotel website and i was a bit apprehensive with this as i have never done this before. I had absolutely no need to worry, we had a wonderful weekend deal including English breakfast, a bottle of champagne on arrival and afternoon tea any afternoon of the stay. I have stayed in the hotel before with my mother and she was so delighted when the waitress recognised her from our previous stay. This is not the sort of thing you expect from a London hotel but it just goes to prove the genuine care and attention you get from all the staff. The room was bright and has everything you need for a stay, it is so quiet its hard to believe your in central London. The location is superb with so many attractions on the doorstep and a good underground station nearby. i just hope i get the chance to stay again.

<Content>A Classic Home Away From Home I recently returned from a trip to the UK which included 4 nights at The Chesterfield Mayfair, the concluding stay of a 12 day business trade mission to the country. I have stayed at The Chesterfield in the past as an individual and found it appealed to my sense of personal taste. I thought the location perfect for our trade mission's meeting schedule in London, so I directed that we should lodge there during our London sojourn. But I was a bit apprehensive, concerned if our fellow travellers would appreciate this hotel as I do. All of them Americans (14), there was a predisposition towards larger properties with big expansive rooms, and I was concerned that The Chesterfield might be too intimate for them. I needn't have worried. Comfort and service will always stake a claim on the most jaded traveller, and The Chesterfield showers both on its guests. The reception staff, from the cheerful doormen to attentive desk staff, were on top of our needs and quickly and efficiently got this large group sorted out, bags delivered to the proper rooms (with not one mistake...and no bar codes!!!!!!). The Chesterfield's guestrooms, radiating warmth and comfort, made every one of our group feel 'at home'. Chambermaids were efficient and never intrusive. Room furnishings were traditional and rich, and in-room electronics were state of the art contemporary. The bar was a joyful, pleasant, stylish retreat every evening. Breakfast service in the bright and cheerful dining room was snappy and food quality top-notch. Evening meals were perfection (try the salmon en croute from the trolley). The staff cannot do enough, from directions to advice, and demonstrate not only good training but a high level of motivation and pride. I love this location, so close to Piccadilly and the West End, an easy walk to Knightsbridge and Bond Street and Jermyn Street shopping, in the heart of Mayfair. I think there is value for money here. The Chesterfield is one of those rare hotels where a guest is perfectly content to spend a day or evening 'in', despite the obvious appeal of London's endless attractions on the doorstep. I have visited London many times, and stayed in many hotels, but Chesterfield has become my absolute favourite, and for value, location, and total comfort it is a winner.

<Content>Chesterfield Mayfair It's an amazing hotel in Mayfair within walking distance of Harrods, Oxford street, Buckingham palace, and various parks. Public transport is also just a block away from the hotel. Staff in the hotel were lovely, being very friendly and helpful. We didn't eat in the restaurant but did have a couple of drinks in the bar. The piano playing in the background added to the ambiance no end.

<Content>Exceptional Service Having stayed many times in London and received excellent service at hotels such as The Dorchester, The Grosvenor etc., I have never been treated to such outstanding personal service as that delivered by The Chesterfield. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and the staff could not have been friendlier or more attentive in a non obtrusive manner. Special mention is deserved by Loris, the most charming of Restaurant Managers you could wish to meet. Service in the Butlers Restaurant was outstanding whether it be for breakfast, afternoon tea or dinner, as was the quality of the food. The Dormer Suite in which we stayed was extremely pleasant and very quiet with little or no noise from outside or inside the hotel, together with lovely extra touches such as the decanter of sherry!! My wife and I will have no hesitation in returning on our next visit to London as this hotel fully deserves it's Tripadvisor rating.

<Content>The best weekend ever! I have just returned from the most amazing long weekend in London, staying at The Chesterfield Mayfair. We arrived at the Hotel earlier than the usual check in time however the staff were wonderful, helpful and friendly with nothing being too much trouble. We opted for a superior double room that I just cannot fault, the room was spacious, well decorated and immaculately clean. The bathroom was simply stunning with possibly the best shower either of us have ever experienced! Nice additions such as bath robes and slippers, bottled water plus ground coffee and a caffitier added to our stay. Our rate included afternoon tea which was fabulous with more of all the lovely sandwiches and cakes offered should you wish. The breakfasts were equally as impressive with a huge choice of well prepared hot dishes on offer alongside the usual cold options.Location wise the hotel is ideal, set a little away from the hustle and bustle of the busier areas, there are plenty of ammenities close by. The tube station (Green Lane) is only a pleasant few mins walk away, as is Piccadilly, certainly an ideal base to explore London from.All in all I can't thank The Chesterfield Mayfair and all its staff for helping make our time in London the most fantastic weekend, Thank You!

<Content>Lovely birthday weekend I selected this hotel from the trip advisor reviews for a weekend in London to celebrate my husbands birthday. I have to say we thought the hotel was very well located, a five minute walk to Green Park tube station and we easily walked to Bond Street  Oxford Street. We had a weekend package and thought this fantastic value. Breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice and the smoked salmon was delicious, everything we ate at breakfast seemed to be very good quality. We also had the afternoon tea on our last day as part of our package and again we are big eaters but just couldn't manage it all (and the scones were just the best). Staff were courteous, polite and helpful without being too intrusive (a birthday card for hubby and additional magazines aimed at us were a very nice touch) and our rooms was plenty big enough and very clean. I often stay in London on business and was surprised to read someone thought the road noise was to loud? This hotel is in a residential area and has double glazing and we certainly didn't hear any traffic noise and we were on the front of the hotel.This hotel is a little more than we usually pay when in London but we are definately planning to stay when we go back for our Christmas shopping weekend. We had two nights in a deluxe room plus breakfast, 1 afternoon tea and a complimentary bottle of champagne as part of their special 'weekender' package for 拢390 for two nights well worth booking.PS: On the basis of this stay my daughter is also going to try a 'red carnation' hotel in a few weeks so let's hope they are all of a similarly high standard.Many thanks to the Chesterfield for helping to make our weekend so special!

<Content>A Luxury Long Weekend Just returned from a wonderful long weekend of luxury at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The staff did everything they could to make our stay special, from doing our whole stay at the weekend rate, to finding an Ipod docking station so we could have music in the room.Our package came with a wonderful breakfast  afternoon tea - a fabulous selection  a meal in itself - both a bit expensive if paid for seperately! And watch out for the bar - 拢12 for a glass of Chardonay is a bit steep when there are great local pubs nearby.The hotel location is the best, just minutes from Green Park  Piccadilly one way or Bond Street  Oxford Street the other. Trully central London.The only minor issue was a little road noise during the night, but you are in the centre of town! Will definitely try to stay hear again.

<Content>OK, but restaurant had major problems I am surprised at how highly this hotel is ranked by other Tripadvisor members. My wife and I stayed for one weekend night in April. The room was fine, although on the small side as most London hotel rooms are. The bed was OK, but no more than that. The mattress was not of the highest quality - certainly not up to Marriott (where I usually stay when in London on business) standards and not a patch on the ones we have at home, including the infrequently used guest room!Generally the staff were friendly and attentive, although not overly so. At one point in the bar during the evening they all seemed to go AWOL at the same time, and we had to wait quite a while to get the bill. What really let it down was the experience in the restuarant. The table wasn't ready for us when we arrived, even though we had reservations and the place was less than half full. It took almost an hour for the main course (fish) to arrive and when it did it was cold. We had to send it back and wait another 15-20 minutes for them to try again. It was a little better second time around, but still not right and by the time it had arrived we had finished the wine and didn't feel like ordering more. It seemed they had real problems in the kitchen that night. This was probably because it was the weekend and - the hotel mainly being aimed at mid-week business users - many of the key kitchen staff would be taking their nights off. In my experience this is an issue with other business hotels. There is, however, no excuse for poor service, especially given the restaurant prices. One other moan about the restaurant - there was no atmosphere at all. A little music would have helped. To his credit , the restaurant manager responsed to our complaints in a very professional and courteous manner, but he obviously didn't have the staff to resolve the problems. I didn't envy him his job that night. The next morning there was a long line for seats at breakfast, so we didn't bother waiting, but checked out and breakfasted elsewhere. All in all I would not be in a great hurry to stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Perfectly Charming! I absolutely loved my stay at the Chesterfield. We arrived earlier than the normal check-in time and they accomodated us. The room was beautifully appointed and the location of the hotel cannot be beat for London sightseeing. Lots of amenities and very conenient to the Tube. I'll definitely be staying here again.

<Content>What a Great London Hotel I stayed at the Chesterfield for three nights on a business trip and it was great. The meeting I was attending was at a larger hotel but I wanted something smaller and in a quieter area. I had a single room which was very small but very nice. All amenities, marble bath etc. I arrived from New York at 10:00 AM and they had a room ready for me (I had emailed with this request) The room was on the second floor on the street but was very quiet. This Mayfair neighborhood is terrific. You can pop outside for a short walk to several very nice parks. And you are just several minutes from the tube. I had breakfast in the dining room two mornings and on the third day it was brought to my room since I was leaving early. Had a sandwich and a beer at the bar one night and that was very good. They have a computer with an internet connection which is great when you're traveling. Everyone was very nice. I hope to come back with my wife someday! Highly recommended!

<Content>Extraordinary Hotel My daughter, grandson and I just returned from a splendid holiday in London. We were privileged to stay in 2 adjoining rooms at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel.The rooms, although small, were beautifully appointed with wonderful amenities. The fresh bottles of water in the morning and again at turndown were truly welcomed.The dining room is better than lovely with a full English breakfast served every morning. Before dinner drinks at the bar and dinner at Butlers were a real treat. All of the above comments are a mere nothing compared to the splendid staff. Ben Yeager, the front office manager and Sam Goss, the food and beverage manager are responsible for having the most professional team I have seen in years.If it were not for the strong pound against our weak dollar, I would return next month to this most amazing hotel.

<Content>Great choice. Great atmosphere. Great people I stayed at the hotel from the 24th to the 28th of April 2008. I booked it after I read the excellent reviews here. My flight was late so I arrived very late at the hotel but I found everything to be ready and waiting for me. Truth be told there was a mistake with my room but I must say that they fixed it ASAP and with no problems. So please take that into consideration. Mistakes are human and the important thing for me and what I am choosing to remember is how swiftly they were dealt with and the manner in which that was made. What I am trying to say is speak up and your issues will be addressed. And solved. In my case every little or big detail I asked for was dealt with exceptionally by the people there and always with a smile. Non of them seemed to be bored or seemed to do things mechanically. The staff is extremely helpful throughout the hotel but not oppressive. They give you room to breath sort of speak. On another note I loved that people throughout the hotel greet you when you pass by them at any time of the day. Gives the place a very friendly atmosphere.  Being disabled I was a little apprehensive about staying there because allot of the reviews on Tripadvisor state that it is not suitable for people with disabilities. Because of my condition I need things the average traveller does not.   Let me tell you that I did not find a problem whilst I was staying there. The hotel is accessible with lifts and rooms with ramps if requested. There is no ramp in the entrance of the hotel but rest assured if you need help they will help you. The rooms are a little cluttered but if you wish to have more manoeuvrability you can ask for things to be taken out of the room and it will be done swiftly. That is what I did. Some things I had moved around and others I had taken out of my room and replaced with others. (in my case chairs with good back support were needed and not the average chairs in the room). Breakfast was lovely. I was given special seating and I used the pillows provided. They even went out of their way to bring me fresh cinnamon and honey with my pancakes and waffles. (Something I am sure is considered very strange in the UK but is very common practice in my country). The bar is very nice and they play nice piano music there in the evenings. It also offers snacks and light meals that are more affordable than the ones in the restaurant. The first night I was taken to room 415 and it was a very nice room but a bath rather than a shower. After that I was moved to room 219. It did a shower as I had requested. Rooms were also of a good size considering we are in London. The rooms seemed to be soundproof. I was not bothered by any noise from the rooms next to mine. Being on the second floor I did not seem to have any problem with noise as I have read on some other reviews here. I found the library a nice and relaxing spot to sit in. Takes you away from most of the noisiest parts of the hotel. There is also wifi access throughout the hotel which is brilliant and it did come in handy especially on the day I was checking out and was waiting for my shuttle to come. There is easy access to green park tube station. It is just a few minutes away and easy to get to. Next to Green park tube station there was a MS in case I needed anything and it is not out of my way even one step as it is right next to the station. So I just stopped there before heading back to the hotel. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this hotel and am planning to stay there again. I recommend this hotel to everyone. The one thing that really needs much work at the hotel is their coffee. Neither the breakfast coffee or cappuccino that I tried were drinkable. I ended up having an extra coffee from one of the coffee shops near the hotel and/or Starbucks throughout London.It is no fluke that this hotel is so high up on London hotels list on this site. I can't wait to go back there! Had a wonderful time.

<Content>Nice Hotel This is a lovely hotel. We found the staff to be courteous and very helpful. We had breakfast included in our package and it is extremely good. We had dinner at the hotel one night but did not think that the restaurant met our expectations nor those of some of the London restaurant review sites. We certainly would not have dinner at the hotel again as the food was only average.We also had afternoon tea on one afternoon with friends and found that experience to be very good.The room was not large but was very comfortable and provided all of the amenities expected of a hotel of this class.We have stayed in London on four occasions over recent years and found the location of this hotel to be very convenient to public transport and many of the places that would be visited as a tourist.

<Content>A very decent place to spend time My girlfriend and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for four days. The hotel clearly takes its reputation and its standard seriously and tries to give the guest the impression that he is in a high-class location.Right at the beginning, an attendant showed us the room meticulously, including instrutions for the TV remote, the coffee maker and the two telephones. Although a bit overstated, it is very typical for the Chesterfield.Rooms are in an excellent condition, shiny, clean (if you wanna be really picky: one day, a part of the curtain was not in order) and very inviting. The staff is very friendly, room, laundry and food service are very enjoyable.The food (a buffet that was included in our rate) has everything you need, but fails to surprise you with any really interesting creations. Worse, however, is the quality of the coffee, which made us speed to the next Starbucks soon after we had left breakfast.That being said, however, there are no more major flaws in the hotel. All of our questions regarding cultural events, cab services to further places (which appearantly is a problem in London) were met with haste and competence.If you are into sports, the hotel might not be the best idea, though: Yes, they give you a brochure with possible running routes nearby, but the building itself lacks both a spa and a fitness centre (you can go to a nearby facility for free).The Chesterfield does a good, sometimes even excellent service to its customers. It's probably not the best hotel of London, but well worth the money for people who want to stay in a nice area (good Indian restaurant nearby).

<Content>Loved the Chesterfield We stayed at The Chesterfield from April 12 - 19th. It was cold and rainy but we still had a great time. Two rooms with my two teenagers and it could not have been better. Clean, clean, clean..The best location, near Green Park and Hyde Park and very quiet - but around the corner from the hustle which my kids liked. I walked in the quiet of Green Park and Hyde Park each morning before everyone got up. Extremely safe area and within walking distance to all the sites in London, plus Regent Street for fun shopping.. Two local Pubs, The Red Lion and The Only Running Footman are next door and serve up fabulous London Pub Fare. Many, many other fine restaurants nearby - the hotel staff was amazing!You won't miss if you book at this hotel. The best I have stayed at in any country

<Content>What a wonderful experience !!! I could be described by my children as being rather difficult to please and I am sure when they booked the Chesterfield Hotel for my 70th birthday, they must have been a bit anxious, to say the least. Well, they need not have worried, myself and my wife had the most wonderful stay there . The staff were so kind, helpful and friendly. We were very impressed and loved everything about the hotel. The room was beautifully ( and recently ) decorated and spotlessly clean! We enjoyed the most delicious and generous breakfast every morning, a must before setting off to view the sights of London! We relaxed in the Hotel'sTerrace Bar in the evenings, where we sat istening to the piano while enjoying the delicious (and reasonbly priced) bar food. The previous month,my daughter, her husband and their six year old also stayed here and had a great time too, so it appeals to all ages!! I would heartily recomend this fantastic hotel to anyone , young or not so young , if like myself , they have very high standards and insist on the very best !!

<Content>An average stay ...... We booked the hotel through one of the links on tripadvisor and got a very good rate for a superior double. Having stayed at some fantastic hotels throughout the UK in the days leading up to our time in London we were dissappointed. While we cannot complain about anything in particular we found the room to be small (we were also on low down in the hotel and near the lift lobby which made it quite noisy).

<Content>Great weekend at the Chesterfield We have just returned from a weekend in London staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The hotel was lovely, the staff exceptional  our overall impression very good. The location could not be better for the things we wanted to do - Knightsbridge/Regent St/Oxford St/British Museum.The only very very slight things that we found were all down to the fact that we had our 1 year old son with us - the rooms are tiny (central london I know) and we our room overlooked the front of the property which was very very noisy on Friday night, as there is a pub just down the road.Had we been on our own, none of the above would have been an issue.We will most certainly return  if our baby is with us request a bigger room overlooking the back of the property.A brilliant weekend - only real downside? Terminal 5 at Heathrow, but that's another story!

<Content>Exceptional stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair! Although it's been awhile since our visit to The Chesterfield Mayfair, I still remember what a wonderful experience it was! We were there in June 2007-My first visit to London, I really wanted an classic English experience and this was definately the place! My husband was working in London during our 4 day stay, so I was also nervous about safety and I can say I felt very comfortable being out and about during the day on my own. The 5 minute walk to Green Park Tube Station was the perfect chance to take in all the local sights. I made it to all the attractions using The Tube. I might add, as a first time visitor to London, one of my favorite things I did on my own was purchase a $25 ticket for the day to ride one of those double decker buses. I chose the narrated routes- 3 different routes for one price- (funny dialouge by the narrators) and had such a great view from the top deck, that i did not want to get off the bus! Great idea for families or rainy day way to see the city effortlessly, esp to get your barings and become familiar with the layout of the city! CLose to the hotel was The Shepard's Market, a quaint area to grab a bite to eat and Picadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, The bURLINGTON Arcade, most museums (the V  A) and Trafalgar Square all within walking distance. I even walked to Harrod's (about a 15-20 min jaunt) because it was a lovely sunny day. Upon arrival from the airport (after 3pm) our room was ready and waiting. We were on the 5th floor and looked out the front of the hotel. Not an exceptional view because of the window casing and window size, you could crane your neck to look up and down the street if you wished. The room was very quiet and most comfortable- non smoking and never smelled any smoke at all. The king bed  bed linens were exceptional, but seemed low to the floor for our american standards. Yes, the room was also small by american standards, but i was fully expecting this since we were in Europe, after all! We never felt cramped, and the size of the room added to the charm and English ambiance. The bathroom was perfect in every way and sparkling clean. The front desk staff and concierge were EXCEPTIONAL! We decided to have some friends join us for our reservation for High Tea at THe Ritz Carlton and the concierge was able to change our reservation for us, not once but twice. Very patient and most professional staff that i have encountered anywhere in the world! When we inquired about last minute theater tickets, they gave us honest and detailed advice about checking at the TKTS booth near Leicester Square, this was perfect for us and saved us lots of $$ on last minute theater tickets. We did not dine in the restaurant, but now reading all the wonderful reviews, i wish we would have! We made a late night stop at the hotel bar and enjoyed the piano player and complimentary snacks. Wonderful bartender and staff there. I have recently recommended this hotel to several friends, and honestly you cannot beat the location and ambiance of this hotel. I would not want to stay anywhere else in London! Promise we'll be back one day!

<Content>the best London hotel I've ever stayed in Without a shadow of a doubt this is the best London hotel I have ever stayed in. There is simply nothing to criticise: the room, the location, the ambience, the food - and the service in particular - are outstanding. I booked a double room, and was upgraded to a King. The room was beautifully furnished and the bathroom was very smart. Afternoon tea is not to be missed: the loveliest sandwiches, scones and cakes! Breakfast is also very good.However, the most impressive thing about this hotel is the level of service - all of the staff I met were charming, helpful and did everything they could to make my stay a most enjoyable one.i wouldn't now want to stay anywhere else in London.

<Content>Business and Pleasure I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in late January, 2008, while on my return to North America from meetings in Europe. Although I had no meetings in London, I still needed to send e-mail and faxes for issue follow-up. The complimentary wireless internet connection provided in the room was more than adequate for the e-mail and internet research I needed to perform. The front desk received and sent faxes for me promptly and confidentially. Even in my single room, the workspace and supplies were excellent. When I returned to my room after a day of museum going and generally tramping about London, it was a great pleasure to see my bed turned down, the TV guide turned to the evening's listings, and the room service menu already opened. The first night I arrived, ragged from too much work and not enough play, I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant. If it is possible to feel wrapped in tender care by complete strangers in a public place, Butler's restaurant is the place to provide it. This is not always the case for business women travelling alone, and it began my stay at the Chesterfield on the best possible note. From service to amenities to cleanliness to location, the Chesterfield met and exceeded my expectations. The attention to detail and overall guest care went beyond anything for which I have paid a similar price in New York City.

<Content>An oasis in our capital This last 2 night stay was our 4th visit to the Chesterfield. From the first moment we stepped over their threshold, staff made us feel so welcome. All the rooms that we have stayed in, the latest being 522, have been great.The location is perfect, quiet but just a 5 minute walk from Piccadilly and the same to Hyde Park and Oxford Street.Service is impeccable, breakfast really sets you up for the day and Dinner in the restaurant is very good.Ahhhh the thought of a sandwich and glass of champagne in the Bar, after arrival is so convivial.Home form Home in London for us.Carol  Ernie.

<Content>A Fantastic Place! General Manager Oliver Raggett and his staff know how to do it right. They handled everything for us -- from setting us up with tours to acquiring football (soccer) tickets to giving us directions to navigating the Tube -- painlessly and efficiently. The rooms were clean and comfortable and they pampered us almost too much. They are friendly and professional, especially in the details many places overlook.The hotel itself was luxurious and perfectly located in central London, with easy access to the entire city via Tube or walking.

<Content>A charming place! I choose the hotel based on the reviews on this page.I stayed a weekend (25/-27/1) together with my wife and we loved it.The rooms are tiny (even by London standards) but really nice and the staff is excellent.Regards,Fredrik

<Content>Chesterfield Mayfair Happy Haven Heart of London Chesterfield Mayfair staff, location and comfort made our stay in London one to remember. My daughter (10 years) and I travelled without hubby who usually does booking, destination finding, carrying to much baggage and hunting and gathering (translated means: finding best restuarants). So to have staff at the Chesterfield happy to provide all these and a comfort level that saw us happily fall into bed each night after a huge day of soking up the sights was a blessing.The staff were mostly not phased by my bute aussie accent and bemused by my odd sense of humour ( I sometimes find the 'lack of english reaction' quite quirky). The Chestefield restaurant 'Butlers' has left me with a remembered love of tea and toast resonant of 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' famous 'Lucy's tea with Mr Tumnus' scene.

<Content>Great Experience My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield from the 18-20th Jan on a 'Mayfair Weekend' package booked directly through the hotel website. From we arrived at the hotel the service from the staff was efficient, friendly and helpful. Our room wasn't that big but had everything we needed for our weekend break as well as being spotlessly clean.The breakfast each morning, which was included in our package, was a dream, with a great selection from the buffet as well as a lovely cooked selection. The service was excellent which made it a very enjoyable and relaxing start to the day. We also availed of the Afternoon tea, which again was included, and I can only describe it as delicious, with wonderful pastries, cakes, sandwiches and scones which was served beautifully.The hotel staff really make this place and for the first time in a long while I felt totally at ease during my stay and really couldn't find anything to grumble about. The hotel is in a good location, about 10-15mins walk to the tube station but you can easily walk to lots of the sites directly through some nice areas.Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be back to stay again!

<Content>Disappointing Having read all the amazing reviews in the site and after a very good experience with the authenticity of reviews on Trip-Advisor I was very disappointed with this hotel.This is a nice expensive hotel with pleasant staff, especially the concierge but this is by no means the fifth best hotel in the world or the first\second in London. This is ridicules. I myself have been to several better hotels in London at similar prices.Rooms 鈥?We booked 2 upgraded Superior King Rooms. The rooms were extremely small, pleasant but so small it was annoying. The rooms were facing an inside court that was looking straight at other rooms. Connecting Rooms 鈥?At booking we asked for connecting rooms. We were told that they can not guarantee but let us understand that they will make an effort. Upon arrival we were told that no connecting rooms were available and that the hotel was fully booked. I asked three times the reception if they can move us to connecting rooms later on our stay and got the same answer. Only on our third day, one of the receptionists told me that they don鈥檛 have any connecting Superior King Rooms, at all in the hotel. Funny they did not mention it on the phone when I made the reservation.Service 鈥?The concierge staff were very kind and helpful, extremely helpful, the best experience we had in the hotel.The reception staff as mentioned earlier were not helpful and were quite impatience to our simple request (we later understood why).Location 鈥?The location is not as good as stated in the reviews. It is a nice area but a little to far to walk to places. Maybe that was because it was so clod.Restaurant 鈥?we did not eat breakfast at the hotel (22 pounds per person) but ate one evening in the restaurant. The food was very mediocre, the staff pleasant and we had a visit of a mouse which did not seem to bother the head waiter at all. All in all, a nice expensive hotel but not nearly as good as described in the reviews. I was disappointed. I guess it is all a matter of expectations.

<Content>Good location, disappointing service Having read all the rave reviews on Trip Advisor about the Chesterfield, we went expecting to be impressed. However things did not go well from check in onwards.Having requested rooms together we were advised that we had been placed 5 floors apart. When they managed to correct this 鈥?after waiting a good half an hour 鈥?we were sent to the only smoking floor in the hotel 鈥?without being told. Coming from New Zealand where everything is smoke free 鈥?we were appalled. When we complained we were treated as if we were being difficult and it took a further half and hour before they managed to accommodate us 鈥?again we were 5 floors apart.Our booking, direct with the hotel, was supposed to include a free upgrade subject to availability, but there was no mention of this at all, and the complimentary bottle of wine was undrinkable. The rooms were absolutely tiny 鈥?the single room could barely accommodate a suitcase and there was no view to speak of. For the price it did not seem like good value for money. On the plus side the concierge was very helpful, the breakfasts were adequate and bar had a very English feel. The location was within walking distance of major London attractions, like Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus and the National Gallery. Overall we would not recommend this hotel based on the service and the size of the rooms.

<Content>Absolutely no complaints My wife and I stayed here on a two night Superbreak stay in January and were impressed from the outset.Upon arrival we asked if we had been allocated a quiet twin room. Without further ado we were instantly upgraded, at no extra cost, to a spacious State room on the 7th floor at the rear of the hotel. This was as quiet as any hotel room in London can be apart from a constant hum from what I took to be the air conditioning sysem in the loft above us. Oddly enough this did not in any way keep us awake at night and probably actually drowned out any peripheral noises that might have been around. Needless to say we slept well!Breakfast was a smooth operation, despite being warned that we might need to queue for a table. In our case this comprised a very short wait whilst sitting comfortably and reading the ( complimentary ) newspaper. The cooked breakfasts ( buffet style ) were excellent and there were plenty of healthier options for those less greedy than us.Check in and check out were painless and without hassle. Our room was pleasantly furnished with extremely comfortable beds, our only quibble being a slight tattiness here and there.The location is excellent and Piccadilly Circus is easily walkable for all but the most slothful.Last, but not least, there is a Tesco Express opposite the hotel, for all those midnight feast items. What more could one ask?We hope to stay here again the next time we are in the 'Big City'.

<Content>Best Hotel I've ever been in We stayed at the Chesterfield Dec. 07 and loved it. We read all of the tripadvisor reviews and disagree with some of them. There is no smoky bar - all public areas are smoke free. If you are going to stay at the Chesterfield then save extra money and eat there. The food preperation is unbelievable and the service excellent. A large part of the experience of the Chesterfield is the wonderful pampering by the staff. You have to be around to be pampered. They make you feel very special and important but in no way pandered to, nor are they insincere - real hospitality people doing a great job. We had a regular small room, beautifully decorated, coffee, hot chocolate and plenty of cookies free. Absolutely silent, no sounds of anykind from anywhere. Cosy, comfortable, pleasant to be in. The hotel is located at Pearl and Charles streets. One block down Pearl and you'll be in Shepards Market where there are plenty of bars, takeouts and markets. Eat there if you want to be jammed in, smoked up and served low average to poor food - you'll save some money but you'll miss half the fun of the Chesterfrield. Many people have their dinner in the bar of the Chesterfield to save on that meal. A 20oz mug of Stella beer, a big puffy sandwich, french fires, tons of cashews, etc. Don't take the tube from the airport unless you want fight the crowds, heft your bags up long stairs to get out of the underground and then walk a mile to the hotel (it's not as easy as some people let on). Take the dot to dot shareride. Seventy bucks airport to hotel door and when they pick you up, if you pay for a discounted round trip - it's your hotel straight to the airline of your choice. I really debated with myself whether to make this review public - more people will want to come and it's going to make reservations more difficult . There is a very good reason why the Chesterfield has so many good reviews. ITS NOT A HOTEL, IT'S A LIFETIME MEMORY!! Orange County California DHunt

<Content>Loved Everything This is Simply the best hotel in London. For couples, business men/women or a lady travelling alone. The staff are fantastic. The food is fantastic and Loris the resturant manager is the most pleasant and knowledgable in the business. My husband and I were on business with a tourist weekend added in.From we entered the hotel and met Peter who showed us round the hotel to the maids it was like living at a home from home where comfort is the name of the game. The dinner was fantastic, the afternoon tea a dream (try the pink champagne). In the evening there is a fantastic piano player in the bar and the barstaff with their white jackets just look and are the business. Try a top of the range French Martini.The rooms are clean and have everything, the night turn down service is bettter than The Balmoral in Edinburgh ( my favourite Hotel).I was sorry to leave, hey I am just away to book again.

<Content>3rd visit - Wouldn't stay anywhere else My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair from just after Christmas through the New Year. This was our third stay in 13 months (significant for someone from Atlanta, Georgia). We have always found the Chesterfield Mayfair to be a wonderful place to stay. Rooms are comfortable. Location is excellent. But the most important thing - as others have mentioned - is the first rate service. We stayed at the Dorchester twice before finding the Chesterfield. And although the room at the Dorchester was incredible - the staff at the Chesterfield Mayfair far surpasses them. We especially enjoyed the breafast, with Sam and Loris ensuring our every need was met. We plan to retun in the spring.

<Content>Great Choice Great Location Stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair from 12/23 to 12/26 and had a great time. As written, the room was small but nice and we had no problems with any of the accomodations. The bed was great and the staff very friendly. The concierge desk could have been a bit more helpful with suggestions on where to eat on Christmas night (I was giving them numbers to call that I got off the Time Out website) but not really much of a complaint. Breakfast in the dining room on Christmas morning was wonderful and the staff was not at all bothered at having to work. There was a stocking filled with Candy hanging on our door when we came out that morning. The bellmen always greeted us by name and were more than helpful...The location is superb. A short walk to the Green Park tube entrance and a short walk to Trafalgar. We walked to a Christmas Eve church service at the Grosvner Chapel, and to Gordon Ramsey's Maze restaurant. The Mayfair area of London is very charming. Covent Garden and now Mayfair are my 2 favorite places to stay in London..

<Content>First Class Service the Difference We stayed at The Chesterfield after reading the reviews on here, and managing the get a bit of a deal on a last minute room. The rooms themselves (we paid for a standard double) were a little dated in decor, but very comfortable indeed, with everything we could have expected. The service at the hotel was first class however, with friendly smiles and helpful staff from start to end. Even though we probably had one of the cheapest rooms in the place, we were made to feel like the most important guests in the building at all times.The location was also very good; right in the heart of Mayfair and near the tube. I thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone, and would gladly stay there again.

<Content>Exquisite Booked this hotel for my Husbands 40th birthday after reading all the reviews. I am delighted to say that we were not disappointed. I had contacted the hotel before going to arrange some balloons in our room and to have champagne in the bar. Everything that I asked for was done. The service was impeccable and the hotel was just wonderful.It is really only a 5 minute walk from Green park tube and within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Picadilly circus, Leicester square and more.I cannot thank the team at the hotel enough. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff do really make you feel welcome. So a huge thanks to everyone who made it a memorable weekend. PS The breakfast was delicious!!!!

<Content>Loved it! My husband and I have just enjoyed a weekend in London staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The staff were attentive, polite and extremely helpful. It is a typically olde worlde hotel situated in a quiet street. We found the location to be ideal for shopping, theatres, galleries and just about everywhere else too! Our only one disappointment was the lack of a mini-bar in our bedroom, although they do supply complimentary tea/coffee and water.

<Content>Great Service - Great Restaurant The Chesterfield does deserve its plaudits - I guess when staying at a big city hotel we all maybe lower our expectations a little as we are something of a captive audience. In fairness to the Chesterfield they don't take the guest for granted and this shows from the welcome all the way to the check out. The reception and bell boy staff are friendly and efficient and endearingly determined to make sure you have all the information you need for a comfortable stay. I've never had such a comprehensive introduction to my room and how all the utilities function!Our rooms were very nice, a decent size for London, nicely decorated. That isn't to say they are overly fancy; the bedding is a little old fashioned but crisp and clean and there's no flat screen TV but overall its very comfortable and adequate.For me the highlight is the restaurant - not just a place for guests to eat breakfast but actually a destination dining room in its own right. This is exactly why you would choose this sort of hotel over the corporates - superb decor, service and a traditional English menu done very well.Location is teriffic - right in the heart of things with lovely twisty London streets all around dotted with all manner of unusual quirky shops.I've stayed in many hotels across London and this is the first time I've left not feeling dissapointed.

<Content>Great Location, Comfortable Stay, Professional Staff A friend and I just returned from our stay in London - we spent 7 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair, and we couldn't have been happier. The hotel is tucked into the charming neighborhood streets of Mayfair, within easy walking distance to many fine pubs and restaurants - we were a quick cab ride to Harrods, Oxford St. and the London Eye - for those interested in taking the tube, it's a quick 5 minute walk to the closest stop - go for it.The staff was amazingly helpful, and just as charming as the location, we felt completely at home - and often enjoyed drinks in the hotel bar after dinner.Probably more in sync with couples traveling w/out kids, perfect for the business traveler.

<Content>deserves its high ranking! Perfect location. Quite small but cozy and well appointed rooms. Excellent service. Deliciouse breakfast and tea. Just the nice and peaceful retreat you are longing for after a busy day in London. 5 minutes walk from everything and still so quiet, both day and night. The staff really seemed to do everything to keep us happy and satified, not because they had to, but because they wanted to. We will definitly stay there again, and have already recommended the hotel to our friends.

<Content>Great location, great service, charming hotel We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 3 nights mid September. The location is great, walking distance from the Piccadilly Circus and the Buckingham Palace. The staff was very warm and friendly at all times, even to my little toddler. The food is overpriced, but that is London for you!!The rooms are a good size considering Europe's standards and the bathrooms are very well appointed. We had a great view of the courtyard from our room.Overall, we had a great stay and would absolutely stay here again.

<Content>Good central location - charming hotel Stayed three nights at Chesterfield based on TA recommendations. Overall impressions were that the hotel is extremely charming and decor is consistent with the old world theme. The breakfast was wonderful and was a real full breakfast. We did not stay for dinner but had afternoon tea one day which was only ok for the price we paid. Rooms were a bit small for what we expected but you sort of have to temper expectations being in Central London and especially Mayfair. The area surrounding the hotel is phenomenal - extremely quiet and very upscale. The area makes the stay at Chesterfield seem to be very exclusive. Tony at the concierge even scored us a reservation at Gordon Ramsay's at Claridges - I had tried to call a week earlier but got turned away. Overall, I would stay at Chesterfield again but perhaps splurge a bit more in a larger room.

<Content>Not Quite What We Had Expected For our wedding anniversary my husband and I had decided on a two night stay in London. Having read the excellent reviews we were looking forward to staying at The Chesterfield. I had booked by phone in September and specifically requested the Music Room and asked to be e-mailed confirmation. Two weeks later I had to ring again and request confirmation, which then duly came. We arrived just before check-in, which is 2pm to be told that our room was not available because the previous guests were still in there, and due to a special package may not check out until 6pm. When my husband asked why we had not been told about this the reply was it was a late booking! At this point I did wonder if I had arrived at the wrong hotel - not one charging 拢399.00. + vat. per night. Seeing that we were not happy another member of staff came over and offered us an upgrade to another suite. We ended up in The Duchess Suite, which although perfectly comfortable was decorated in the style of a Victorian gentlemen's club - lots of old prints, very brown and dark. Not quite what we had in mind for our anniversary! Breakfast the following morning was again not what I would have hoped for at a charge of 拢24.00. Although the room was virtually empty - only two other couples when we arrived, every one there seemed to be having problems with getting what they had ordered. The next day we decided to breakfast out and I can recommend Europa - 37 Albemarle Street for a tasty cooked breakfast at 拢6.00. Hoping that the evening food would be better we ordered room service, again there were problems with the order and when my steak arrived it was completely overcooked. I would have sent it back but we were due at a concert, so didn't have time. Finally, when we got home I realised we'd been overcharged on our use of the mini bar. Now for the good bits! The location is excellent, and quiet at night. The majority of the staff are extremely helpful and courteous. We were asked if we were happy in our room and I'm sure had we wanted to raise other issues these too would have been dealt with, but we wanted to get on with enjoying our time in London together. Which we did immensely.

<Content>excellent choice great personal service!!! Stayed at this hotel recently and arrived early (before 2pm) left our bags with the hotel, the hotel staff were very helpful and helped us with bags doors etc, went shopping and came back our room wasnt ready still alothough they were very apologetic about this and we waited in the hotels lovely bar area warm and very inviting after a mad crazy day spent shopping.We got our room key for our junior suite eventually and our bags were all laid out for us in the room, the room had a baby cot as we requested and the room was not as large as i wouldve expected after paying extra to have the junior suite although it was themed and the furnishings were very lavish and the bathroom was large with a jacuzzi bath. (which after a day shopping in london was a delight!)We really enjoyed the service at their bar and in the morning for breakfast the staff just couldnt do enough for you i would say the hotel should probably be rated 5 star as it was immmaculate and service was second to none.overall apart from small rooms, the hotel is really nice with a good location just of berkley sq and 5 mins walk to oxford st, it is charming and the staff cant do enough for you, and i would stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Chesterfield Mayfair We spent 9 days at the Chesterfield Mayfair in London. It excelled our expectations. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They made us feel at home. The service was prompt and the restaurant served excellent food. The hotel itself has retained the old style charm of the past while it has been upgraded. Modern conveniences have been added but the cozy charm has been well maintained. It is charming boutique hotel.Furthermore, the location is a plus. It is near both the tube and bus stops. Shepherd's Market is only one block away. There we found a number of good little restaurants that were affordable, considering the drop in the dollar.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel We visit London twice a year and The Chesterfield is the only hotel we would ever consider staying. The hotel itself is beautiful - sophisticated and elegant yet small and charming like a private club. The staff is second to none and everyone makes sure your stay is the very best. The bar and restaraunt are excellent - both the food and the very gracious staff. The Chesterfield is like our home away from home.

<Content>Lovely treasure of a hotel. We just finished our honeymoon with a stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the room, and the staff. The are warm and attentive. The room was comfortable and beautiful. The location could not be beat. We were thrilled with the quiet, wonderfully appointed hotel. We would absolutely stay there again, and recommend them at the highest level to anyone!

<Content>A question of luck This is the third time I have stayed at the Chesterfield. My first room was very noisy, as it gave onto Charles Street - just about every taxi in London must go past the hotel. At the time, I told the hotel that less would be more: The small room is so overcrowded with little pillows, vases and other unnecessary items that you can hardly move round. The second time I was lucky as I had a room at the back, but it was equally clustered. This time was the worst, though I was told I had been upgraded to a junior suite. The floorboards creaked so much in my room and in those next and above it that I did not dare go to the - tiny - bathroom during the night! Short of lying on the bed, it was very uncomfortable to watch the - not flat-screen - TV. The drawers were too small to put a shirt into them. The room is being heated through the air-conditioning - very noisy and it blows the smoke from the smoking rooms into what should be a non-smoking room. So, do beware of the rooms which have a name plate on the door!Now a more positive note: As other reviewers have pointed out, staff are very friendly and I love the restaurant, especially in the evening, though breakfast is also very good (too expensive).I shall return to the Chesterfield, but only to eat, not to stay.

<Content>Brilliant Service, Accommodation, Location  As with other reviewers here and elsewhere we found The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel exceeded our expectations in every respect. As you may see from my other reviews I rarely give 5 ratings; simply because so few places merit a perfect score. The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel deserves a 5+++! Honestly, we could not have been MORE impressed and pleased with the quality of the accommodation, location, service, staff  facilities. Perfect on every front and we're quite demanding! For those interested more details follow below, but in short: a stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair will not disappoint and provided very good value for price in London. Check their website directly for special offers which certainly were advantageous over the web-based travel sites. Reception: We arrived at noon Friday and hoped for an early check-in. We had let them know we'd be early and while they would not guarantee availability our room was ready upon arrival; obviously this started things off on the right foot! Reception staff were of course welcoming  courteous. The concierge, Darren Briggs, was an absolute GEM! He recognized our name, provided the theater tickets delivered from a friend, suggested some restaurants near the theater and gave us a brief review assuring us we'd be very entertained by the musical Wicked!The Room (#214; Superior King) As others mention the rooms are truly quite lovely, immaculately clean and designed to satisfy travelers requirements. Our room, is pictured on their website (taupe-striped silk draping  mirror above the bed) and was even more lovely in reality, with an extremely comfortable King-sized bed, fine linens, and ample down pillows (although hypoallergenic foam pillows were available upon request.) We slept like babies  awakened refreshed. The thermostatic control worked perfectly; allowing us to keep our room cool for sleeping  warm for bathing. Plenty of storage space for our clothing and luggage without taking-up room space. We were combining work with pleasure, so the free wireless connection and spacious desk area were unexpected conveniences!The bath was slightly larger than typical Euro-baths, with marble and modern fixtures and (surprise!) all plumbing working as expected! No bidet, which is generally not a problem for we Americans! Bathrobes, slippers,  toweling all very nice quality, soft  brightly white.Gilchrist  Soames vanity supplies (soap, lotion, shampoo, etc.) were replenished daily.Full English breakfast was included in our weekend package and we opted to dine in-room. Our breakfasts were delivered on-time and were simply delicious both mornings. Highly recommend the Eggs Benedict which was scrumptious and HOT upon arrival (truly a small miracle!) My husbands traditional eggs, bacon, potatoes  toast were eaten with gusto as well, so I presume they were luscious. Our second evening we dined at Butler's Restaurant in the hotel. We were a bit concerned when is wasn't very busy on a Saturday--but our concerns were quickly dashed by the excellent service and cuisine! The Scottish  Irish Smoked Salmon Duo appetizer was a meal in itself: carved table-side with a more than ample portion--luscious! I went traditional with a Potted Chicken Pie that was not only delicious but presented more beautifully than I would have imagined possible. My husband had a carved ham with mustard sauce and was quite impressed. No room for dessert but we were tempted to try the complimentary dark chocolate truffles--perfect finish to our meal. Tara the hostess  sommelier recommended a lovely South African white wine that paired beautifully with our diverse main courses! I'll wrap up this long review by repeating our recommendation that anyone looking for a luxurious, well-priced, 4-star hotel in a very walkable, quiet area of London should look no further than The Chesterfield Mayfair.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! The Hotel is run by the same people that run the Milestone, one of Englands top small hotels and the same professional management is evident. The staff is friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable and well decorated with that English look. I actually liked the Chesterfield better than the Milestone (we stayed there September '06) because the Chesterfield is closer to the major attractions and the theater district. You are about a 5-10 minute walk to the tube and there are a number of good restaurants close by. I would definiely stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again!

<Content>Chesterfield Mayfair - Service like no Other Stayed at the CM for 7 nights, the first 3 on business. As we booked about 20 people into the hotel plus used a conference room for 2 days we received an excellent rate, otherwise may not have been able to afford this hotel due to very poor exchange against CDN $.Hotel selected by exec assistant in London, but was happy to see it ranked so high by Trip (which I now swear by as the definitive hotel reference site in the world - yes you heard it hear.)The CM staff cannot absolutely do enough to make your stay the best possible. We requested a room with two beds, and although we were upgraded to a junior suite (sweet) the bed was a double that was not split. They had just upgraded the room and converted two small singles into a jr suite. In a few moments staffers were in the room fixing the bed.The room had so many amenities it's hard to list them all. Many bottles of fresh water were made available daily, each evening a complementary hors d'oeurves were provided (smoked salmon; quail eggs), and also newspapers. There was more.Like all hotels in Europe, rooms on the small side, even the jr suite. My only negative is that the rooms at the CM seem to be a bit overdecorated and a bit too much stuff crammed into them. The staff are incredible, and the concierge will do anything and everything to assist. You will do best to take their advice on local restaurents and the like. They are the best!I would caution you on booking rooms that face the next door courtyard, on Friday or Saturday nights as they often have functions there (it's a very classy club of some sort), and the music can go on to 11:30 at night. We had to request a move of rooms due to this, which the hotel was able to accomodate right away. We were lucky they were not 100% full, which they can be.The location could not have been better, and what you could not walk to (which was not much), you could easily tube it via Green Station. Breakfast is highly expensive at 18-20 GBP per person, which is about $40 CDN, and quite absurd at that price. My wife found an excellent place for breakfast two blocks away on a small side street where you could get a perfectly great eggs, back bacon, toast and coffee for about 5 GBP. Look for Le Strada, in a side street just off Berkely Square. There is a Starbucks right on the corner. I have no reservations highly recommending the Chesterfield Mayfair, it is spotlessly clean, very quite (when no parties next door are going on), and has exceptional staff. Pictures on the website and are representative, but always make the rooms seem larger than they really are (in all cases, not just here.)

<Content>Good hotel with personal service Stayed 5 nights at this hotel. It is in a residential neighborhood with a few neighborhood pubs. Within walking distance to Green Tube Station, near Berkley Sq. Our room included a full English breakfast. Nice service in the diningroom. Food so-so. The buffet is included with limited fruit, cereal, and very few pasteries. But, when you sit down, you are served 4 slices of toast w/jam on the side immediately. The room was small and crowded by American standards. There was a King bed with a fake heavy fur comfortor. We asked that it be removed for the week and they took it out immediately. There seems to be alot of furniture in such a small space. Tiny closet too. The bathroom was big, marble and very nice. The room and hotel are very clean! One night we asked for an extra pillow and returned to our room (with turn-down service) and each side had 4 large feather pillows! The linens are lovely.The people at the front desk where quick to greet you and we found all of them helpful. We asked Chris to check on some reservations we made on our own before leaving the U.S. He had no problem with our request. Seemed happy to do it. They were helpful with directions. London is just very expensive right now for Americans. We loved it and would go back if the $ ever gets stronger. All and all this is a very comfortable hotel. It is not a luxury hotel but felt very homey and safe there.

<Content>Can't wait to go again For a romantic break without the children we booked this hotel for a lovely five days of luxury, shopping and dining and it exceeded expectation. The upgrade to a suite was highly appreciated, the room was divine. The restaurant serves lovely food (I recommend the hight tea for a wonderful afternoon), at breakfast there is so much to choose from, it was a great way to start every day. The hotel is so very well situated for all the shops in knightsbridge and oxford street, that we walked nearly everywhere.But the best bit of the whole experience was the wonderful staf, especially in the bar, they always had time for you and made very nice cocktails.The next time we are in London, this is where we will be staying.

<Content>Loved this hotel! My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield for three nights in September 2007. We can not say enough about this hotel: the staff was fantastic, the rooms were beautiful, the breakfast cannot be beat, and the location is perfect.Our weekend package was upgraded from a standard double to a superior upon our arrival. The package included one English tea, a bottle of champagne, and full breakfast each morning. Breakfast was unbelievablel there was a full menu from which to choose. My favorite was the Scottish eggs Benedict (that is a muffin, poached eggs and Scottish smoked salmon). The hotel is about a five minute walk to the Green Park tube station and about a fifteen minute walk to Piccadilly. The hotel is lavishly decorated; we felt as if we were staying in a 19th century mansion. Of course, there were all the amenities: sat. TV, heated bathroom floors and mirror (no fogged-up mirror!).After traveling in Paris and Zurich, the super friendly staff and the comfortable amenities made the end of our trip a real treat. We would not hesitate to stay at the Chesterfield upon our next visit.

<Content>A great hotel Over the years we have stayed at many 5 star hotels in London and, from our point of view, this is the best. It's not the biggest or the flashyest but the standards of service from the staff, the general atmosphere, the location and the cleanliness are second to none. We have stayed here a few times and we're looking forward to our next visit.

<Content>Excellent stay at the Chesterfield We chose this hotel, for a two night stay, based on other Trip Advisor reviews and were very pleased we did.The location is central in itself but is less than 10 mins from the Underground, with major tourist sites then only minutes away.The hotel was very welcoming and the room, was good with plenty of space for clothes and luggage although a large desk and TV cabinet meant space for easy chairs was restricted.The en-suite was nice but the design meant water was too easily distributed in the rest of the bathroom, when using the shower. The criticisms however, are very minor compared to the experience as a whole.We ate in the hotel's restaurant the first evening. This was expensive but very good and came with a complimentary glass of champagne after we had been asked on arrival, at the hotel, if we were celebrating anything and we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. We ate early before going to a show and although the staff were excellent and aware of our tight schedule, they took so long to serve the food that we almost missed our show, despite the fact we were their only customers! On any other night though, the experience would have been appreciated!The room came with a complimentary english breakfast at the weekend, very expensive otherwise, although you could eat plenty and it was of good quality. A complimentary newspaper was also provided each morning, which was appreciated!Overall the the staff were very pleasant and helpful and the hotel is quiet and in a good location, a recommended stay!

<Content>Not bad Wife and I stayed here 8/20/07 - 8/25/07. Very centrally located. Closest tube station is Green Park which is less than 5 minute walk. Tube was our primary mode of transportation - would have liked it to be closer, but it's not bad. Green Park is on multiple lines so it's convenient. There's a Sainsbury market along the way which allowed us to pick up food/ supplies. Service was very friendly and appeared to be very responsive even though we didn't take much advantage of it. Initially received a room towards front of hotel but there was noise from construction in nearby buildings. Got moved to a quieter room which was towards back of hotel. Having been used to American/ Asian standards, my biggest complaint is that the room is on the small side as is the bathroom, but kept clean. Did not get a chance to try the on-site restaurant nor did we take advantage of any on-site amenities. (Not really sure what amenities there were.) Room could have used a mini-fridge. For the price, it should also include internet access.

<Content>Lov-er-ly! This is a boutique type hotel that my husband and I booked quite randomly. It was an unexpected delightful surprise. If you like everything about beautiful hotels except their assembly-line size than this place is for you. It's just the right size for more personal service and the location is unbelieveable. It's a nice walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace and Mayfair is the Beverly Hills of London. Full English breakfast was included in our room rate and it was excellent. There are high end shops on Bond Street (a couple of blocks away) and cute small cafes all around. Bus and tube stops are a few blocks away. I cannot recommend this hotel more highly!

<Content>Fantastic!! Stay here!! We stayed here for our 1st wedding anniversary for a romantic weekend away. I had completed one of the preference forms before going and told them it was our anniversary as it asks you on the form. As soon as we checked in we were wished a Happy Anniversary and were told that we had been given a free upgrade to The Music Suite. The room was small but fantastic with a huge four poster bed and the most amazaing bathroom I've ever seen. The bath was a stand alone one that could have fitted 4 people in it! Because we were in a suite we got canapes delivered to our room early evening and chocolates left on the bed at night which was a lovely touch.The staff couldnt do enough for you and took an interest in you. Breakfast was fab. There is nothing bad I can write because the hotel was ace!!

<Content>Chesterfield Mayfair - Best hotel in London My teenage daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights in July. This is an excellent hotel in a classy, lovely residential neighborhood (Mayfair), convenient to everything. The rooms are generous and the bathrooms are beautifully appointed and spotless. The hotel staff are just fantastic - very helpful and pleasant in every respect. I was very wary of London hotels, having read many with bad reviews on hotels.com. I chose this hotel because it had uniformly good reviews on tripadvisor.com. I booked my stay on hotels.com and got an excellent price (for London!), including a full English breakfast every day (in the room or in the restaurant). Overall this was an exceptionally good value in every way. Next time I go to London, I am staying here - no need to look any further!

<Content>Unique experience In July this year I stayed at this hotel with a friend of mine. We were looking for a good hotel and got the name of the Chesterfield from a travel agent brochure. We checked out the hotel's reputation on tripadvisor before booking. I must say the hotel has a lot to offer: next to its excellent and quiet location, the staff is extremely friendly and very service-oriented; rooms, restaurant and lobby are very well maintained and very clean. Breakfast is superb. We didn't have lunch or dinner at the hotel though.A bit on the downside was the size of the room we stayed in as well as its wallpaper: the deep blue vertical lines all over the room felt very unrelaxing to say the least. Still, this is a detail and probably related to personal taste.As the price / quality mix is quite right, and the hotel is very well located, I'd definitely advise it to other travellers, especially to Business travellers.

<Content>Unbelievable Service at the Chesterfield Mayfair My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair. We were there for three nights, business related but Sat. and Sun. we toured London. The Chesterfield was recommended to us by our travel person at work, a colleague, and tripadvisor.com reviews. Many of the trip advisor reviews note the high levels of service at the Chesterfield, but you cannot imagine it until you experience it. I would like to highlight the staff, we arrived at 7:30am on a Saturday, and we were treated extremely well, given our king room, Flavio helped us with our bags, Anthony the concierge was excellent, and the restaurant staff were exceptional. The breakfast crew, Fe, Carolina, and the other ladies whose names I cannot recall, were wonderful. The food was excellent. The dinner staff was similarily exceptional, Tara, the sommelier, the host (can't remember his name), Aldo the meat carver, and all of the wait staff were amazing. The food was delicious. We ate breakfast every day and dinner every night in the restaurant because of the service and the food, we did not care to try any other restaurants in London. The location was excellent for touring, many spots are within a short 5 minute walk such as Green Park/tube station, the Big Bus stop at the Ritz, Picadilly Circus, Hyde Park, Regent Street shopping, and it's only a short 10 minute walk from the hotel through Green Park to Buckingham Palace.If I could offer any constructive feedback, the shower was not so good, the shower heads are too diffusive, my wife opted for baths as she is short and could not enjoy the shower, and the water goes everywhere in the absence of a complete enclosure or shower curtain. A minor issue when compared to the exceptional level of service. We'd stay there again and recommend it to all of our friends.

<Content>Great location, helpful staff, wonderful food... My wife and I stayed for just one night - next time it will be longer! Rooms are tastefully decorated and furnished, the staff are extremely helpful and courteous, the food is excellent - all in all excellent value for money and a special experience! The location of the hotel could not be better for visiting London and i have no hesitation in recommending the Chesterfield Mayfair.

<Content>A class above In an age where it is all too easy for Hotels to take your money and not offer much in return it was a breath of fresh air to walk into the Chesterfield and be greeted with the friendliest staff I have come across in my travels so far.Both my wife and I had a truly wonderful time where staff were at our every beck and call and no task or request was too small. I particularly enjoyed sitting in The Terrace enjoying fine whiskies whilst my wife caught up with old girlfriends.As a seasoned traveller I believe the ambiance of a Hotel can be sensed upon immediate arrival and in the case of the Chesterfield all i could sense was warmth.This is a truly outstanding Hotel where if you require a little love and tenderness, as opposed to a fake smile and a hand requesting your credit card, I fully recommend the Chesterfield.If only Sydney would take a leaf out of their book.Thank you once again.

<Content>Great Hotel From some Aussie travellers. Had a great stay - staff have tremenduous value of customer relations. Nothing was any trouble. Restaurant and food fabulous. Could be considered expensive by what we are used to in Australia but what the heck treat yourself to being pampered. Rooms not overly large by our standard but nothing out of place, rooms practical and well appointed. Room service terrific - no sooner off the phone and there was a knock at the door. Well positioned and quiet. Thank you to our NZ friend Cameron who took our bags on the first day - a very pleasant and excellently presented young man. All the staff made it a great experience. My wife and I will certainly stay here again. Thank you.

<Content>Much better than corporate hotels I have stayed in the Chesterfield Mayfair a couple of times whilst onbusiness in London. Whenever I have stayed, the service has been excellent. The last time I stayed on my own, I was greeted at reception and asked if I would like a complimentary drink in the bar - how could I refuse! All the staff are extremely friendly and polite, room service is quick and food still hot when delivered. The room I had last time was quite small - but was spotlessly clean and had everything I needed. Staying at the Chesterfield is a much more pleasant experience than staying in a larger 'corporate' hotel.

<Content>I'll Be Back Again! I love this hotel. It鈥檚 above my budget, but in a year鈥檚 time I hope to be back for another short stay. I felt so pampered while I stayed there.The management and staff are bursting with pride in their facility, and it shows. The place is immaculate. Everything that can be polished, has a high sheen. The rooms have everything that a hotel guest can be anticipated to need. In my room, everything worked well, from plumbing to air conditioning to lights. (I can鈥檛 tell you the number of times I have stayed in a hotel and found light bulbs out, or balky A/C.) When I had a bit of trouble with the in-room safe, I called for assistance, the engineer came within 5 minutes, and in another minute the safe was working. The guest toiletries were worthy of a spa and were renewed daily. The bed had the perfect balance of cushiness and firm support. The restaurant employs highly competent cooks who turn out perfect meals, and wait staff who ensure you are happy with your meal. There is Internet connectivity in the guest rooms. For those traveling without laptops, the hotel has a high-speed Ibahn Internet portal. If you don't use all the Internet minutes on the Ibahn card, you can expend the remaining minutes in the next 12 months. I expended mine at an airport hotel later in my journey.I found the staff had a highly-developed service ethic. Any help I needed, I only had to ask. I was astonished to be able to have my room by 9:30 AM, although I had assured them I didn鈥檛 expect a room to be available at such an early hour. (My good luck. No one should expect that.) Even before my arrival, the concierges had patiently corresponded with me by email to find a 鈥済ood鈥?seat at a West End play, and they endured my fickleness with absolute courtesy. (鈥淣o, that seat is behind a pillar. No, that one is near the end of the row and has a poor view. No, I want the Royal Circle.鈥? In the end they booked me a great seat. They booked my pick-up and transport from the airport. To my surprise, they didn鈥檛 send me a Black Cab, but a chauffeured Mercedes, for only a few pounds more. After clearing immigration and baggage claim, I presented to the arrivals area. Although I was a half hour late, the driver was waiting for me, holding up a sign-board with my name on it. What a welcome sight for an exhausted traveler at 5:30 AM. That same excellent driver was available later to take me to my play and whisk me back to the hotel afterward. The concierges helped me to locate specific stores on a street map and gave me clear directions that made it easy to accomplish my shopping. Each time I returned, shopping bags in hand, they asked me if I had found everything. At all times during my stay, I was treated like a VIP.As a lone female traveler, I felt extremely safe at this hotel in the lovely Mayfair district. It is only a 5-minute walk from Green Park tube station, convenient to any number of Central London shopping areas, and within walking distance of some theatres.In summary, yes, the prices in Mayfair are high, but you鈥檒l receive value and service for your money at this hotel. In the past, at other hotels, I have paid more and received far less. If you are a female traveler coming alone to London and want to treat yourself, do shopping and take in a play, I highly recommend you book at the Chesterfield Mayfair.

<Content>Loved the Chesterfield Great hotel in a great location. We spent a week here in January and couldn't have asked for a better location and hotel. We paid a little over $200 a night and included breakfast. The location was convient to everything and the staff was very accomidating to us being our first time to London. If we go back to London we would definately stay there again.

<Content>Yet another wonderful stay - home from home We have been visiting London 4 or 5 times a year on business and pleasure for about twenty years. Around ten years ago we discovered the Chesterfield - there was such a warm and personal welcome. Compared to other London hotels where life is anonymous and the service sometimes 'not so good' the Chestefield was a haven. Its location is so convenient for both business and leisure, its restaurant must be one of the best in London.Despite being gold card Hilton members we always choose to stay at the Chesterfield when in London. It has become our home from home and the odd thing to do would be to go anywhere else. Sadly we do not visit as much now as we are retired but we would not think of going anywhere else. Our recent visit took in the Chelsea Flower Show and the Sound of Music and with the help of the Chesterfield our short visit to London was just magic. VM  PM MBE Edinburgh UK

<Content>Perfect in Every Way I was traveling alone and wanted a safe and comfortable hotel. Being familiar with the Mayfair area, I found the Chesterfield and will return there whenever in London.The hotel is small and lovely, the dining room and bar area are inviting and the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. You will love your room and bathroom! I had coffee in my room each morning and it arrived within minutes.The ladies room on the lower level is worth a trip :-) !!About a block away is Half Moon Street and Shepherd's Market. This is a quaint area, little shops, cafe's and popular with the locals.You can walk to Buckingham Palace, through Green Park, in about 15 minutes. You can hop the #14 bus and be at Harrod's or The VA in 10 minutes. It's a perfect location. Go and enjoy!Barbara from Northern Virginia (60 yrs young)

<Content>Great hotel in a FANTASTIC location!! We chose the Chesterfield Mayfair for our first trip to London based on trip advisor reviews. We liked the location because the hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to the Green Street tube stop. There isn鈥檛 too much around the hotel but if you walk a few blocks you鈥檒l run into tons of things. We walked very easily to Piccadilly Circus everyday. So the location was fabulous. We had access but none of the fuss! Our room was very nice as well. It was very, very clean. Housekeeping does a great job. I liked the bathrooms too. Both were just the right size for my husband and I. The staff were very nice as well. They fall over themselves trying to help you. It rained out while we were there and they were always ready with an umbrella or a taxi. We didn鈥檛 eat in the restaurant; it seemed expensive. We had a few drinks and a dessert in the bar and it converted to almost $50 US. There are two pubs a block away that were fantastic 鈥?Red Lion and the Punch Bowl. The hotel was lovely; we鈥檇 return, if only for the location. One plus 鈥?we left (by accident) some money out on the dresser. It was there when we returned. I鈥檇 highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>A bit disappointed I chose this hotel for my parents, my husband and myself as it was number 1 on the TripAdvisor website, and we were coming to stay in London for the first time. Certainly the helpfulness of the staff more than lived up to expectations. They were courteous and attentive. The bedrooms were quiet and well equipped, but in our bedroom the TV didn't work, and they were unable to repair it.The real disappointment was the meal in the restaurant. It was expensive even by London standards, and we were brought our main courses which went cold while we were waiting for the vegetables. I would advise that if you use this hotel you go out to eat.

<Content>Great Mayfair Hotel We stayed 6 days in June. This is a wonderful Mayfair hotel. Check inwas efficient. We accepted an upgrade for a reasonable price(rememberreasonable in London is expensive). The staff were gracious and welcoming. The room was large and comfortable. Housekeeping was spotless. One special comment is that the piano player in the barwas outstanding. Ask him to play Cole Porter and Duke Ellington. You can trust all the great reviews. The photographs are accurate. We would definitely return.

<Content>Where 'Have a Nice Day' really means 'Have a Nice Day' Okay, this is not a cheap hotel but never have I been made to feel so welcome by the staff at any hotel. Reception, Door, Housekeeping and Breakfast people were just so genuinely friendly and welcoming. Great location, terrific breakfast selection and a mean Mochito in the terrace bar though this bar is for winding down, not catching the London buzz. Will be back when next in Town.

<Content>The Very Best! We have stayed at The Chesterfield about 5 times. Several stays were for two weeks at a time as we enjoyed London. This hotel has class, comfort, fantastic service as well as fine cuisine. We enjoy it because of location to the sites of London as well as the tube to Heathrow and for general transportation. Theater, Parks, Galleries as well as the Palace are all within walking distance. What a great staff to make our visits memorable. We plan to return and enjoy the Chesterfield again.

<Content>Excellent value in the heart of London Just left the Chesterfield after 2 wonderful nights. What makes this hotel stand out in London is the staff. Nothing is too much bother and if they say they will do something, it gets done. An obvious comment you may think, but this just doesn't happen in lots of London hotels. Rooms are small but deliciously furnished and the hotel as a whole feels intimate and welcoming. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone if they wish to stay in central London

<Content>Great service and lovely hotel My partner and I were having a night out in London and decided to book into a nice hotel for the night (even though we live in London). Booked a room at the Chesterfield via their website which seemed to give the best prices. Booked a Superior room as there was not much difference between that and a standard room. At the weekend full english breakfast was included.The Chesterfield is in Mayfair on a lovely quiet street - yet moments away from Bond Street, Park Lane etc. As soon as you arrive the service is great. Doorman opens the door and you are greeted by the freindly reception and concierge staff. Special thanks to one of the recpetionists Cindy who was charming. We were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite and checked in and were taken up to our suite. It was fantastic a separate living room with TV and then a large bedroom and huge bathroom. The Chesterfield is a traditional english hotel in that the furniture is mainly antique but it has been decorated in a very stylish way. We had a call shortly afterwards to check the room was OK and we had everything we needed. We ordered afternoon tea in the lounge of our suite and felt thoroughly spoilt!Returning back to the hotel at night it is in a safe area and it was very quiet so a good night's sleep. Breakfast was served in the restuarant with an a'la carte english breakfast to order form as well as a buffet continental breakfast.Overall a lovely experience in a grand old hotel in Mayfair and we had only paid just over 拢150 for this so well worth it. Definitely a good hotel. Upgrading to a Superior room would seem well worth it.

<Content>Exceptional Service My boyfriend and I stayed just for just one night and I can鈥檛 say enough just how exceptional the service was. The d茅cor of our room was quite old fashioned and not very big for a superior king room but it had everything you could possibly need; air conditioning, iron, ironing board, tea/coffee tray (with cafetiere), fluffy bathrobes and slippers, hairdryer, plenty of mirrors and plug sockets, even a stationery kit!The queen sized bed was lovely and comfortable. So much so that I slept like a baby and missed breakfast which is a shame as the reviews on here suggest it was worth having! All in all, a great hotel and very friendly efficient staff.

<Content>A more nuanced view While unqestionably the hotel has many endearing qualities as enumerated in most other reviews, the guest rooms are most certainly not among them. We had booked a junior suite for 4 nights in late April on the basis of it accommodating a third person, but after 10 minutes in the room decided to splurge and upgrade to an executive suite. The latter had two rooms with a pull-out sofa bed in the larger, almost living room in size anteroom that led to the separate bedroom. But back to the junior suite. While it had a super-size king bed, about two feet from the foot of the bed was a rectangular or oblong structure, close to 4 feet in height and about the same length, that's sole purpose was to contain a pop-up television set. Not only was it an obstacle but it had the effect of sub-dividing an already smallish room. Why the TV was not placed on the glass-topped table a couple of feet behind it was a mystery to me. Moreover the two matching high-backed armchairs to the side of the table could have been right out of a 1930's stage set. Badly in need of recovering and most uncomfortable to sit in, they should have been consigned to a garage sale a long time ago. Really, the room had a distinct tired look to it, and judging by its size I would have to assume the regular rooms must be, say, quite compact. On a more positive note, the staff was unfailingly attentive and friendly and the hotel's location, near Berkeley Square, couldn't be better. While the dinner we had one evening in the hotel restaurant, Butler's, was excellent, the breakfast buffet was nothing special (e.g. little variety of fresh fruit). As to whether I'd return, it's tough to say. If I did, it would more likely be for dinner in the restaurant preceded by a cocktail in the quintessentially English bar, a delight in itself. H.W.H.

<Content>Great location, great staff, great hotel It鈥檚 the 3rd time we have stayed at the hotel and each time it seems to get better and better. The staff are fantastic and the location has to be one of the best in London. The rooms are beautifully decorated and have everything you could ever wish for.We ate in the restaurant on one evening the food was outstanding, I had the Dover Sole and my wife had the rib of beef from the beautiful silver trolley. Breakfast each day was out of this world, even the pastries are warm! The bar is also great and somewhere you can relax and soak up the atmosphere.A little tip is book on the hotels website as it seems to be 拢1 cheaper than other sites and from time to time they have special offers, such as a bottle of wine as an added extra.

<Content>Great place to stay in London. Trip advisor member, Bangor, Co. Down This was our second visit to the Chesterfield Mayfair and, as on the previous occasion, everything was excellent from the moment we arrived until our departure 3 days later. The standard of service is top class and it appears nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Everybody is friendly and polite and more than willing to help. Our superior king room was very comfortable although not really all that large, and the bathroom is rather on the small side but well supplied and used towels were changed twice daily.The food is of a high standard and afternoon tea was beautiful, well presented and delicious. Highly recommended.Breakfast is excellent and freshly cooked and hot. Scrambled eggs and smoked salmon very tasty although the scrambled eggs were not as nice this time as previously.One morning at breakfast a mouse scuttled from under the curtain and ran across the carpet. My wife reported it to the restaurant manager who was most concerned and he said he would report it right away ( which he did ) so that the rodent experts could be brought in to investigate. We will be back again and look forward to our next visit and I am sure we will enjoy it as much as we have done in the past.

<Content>Good value for money considering the location and facilities. Upon entering this hotel my heart sank, as the reception was very dark and decorated in what could only be described as old fasioned english pub style. I feared for the state of the rooms. However thankfully, check in was polite and friendly, which helped relax me somewhat. Our room was small but well laid out, the bathroom was even smaller, so small i marvelled it as a small feat in engineering, that they had managed to fit a bath, toilet and washbasin in it. Thankfully aside from the horrible swirly carpet, the room fittings were tasteful and the bathroom bright and nicely appointed. We slept well which must say something for the quality of the bed and in the morning we enjoyed a mouthwatering breakfast in the restaurant. All in all, considering the price we paid and location, i feel this hotel offered excellent value for money.

<Content>Just an okay stay Booked the Chesterfield after reading the many glowing comments on Tripadvisor. It is a well-kept small British hotel in an upscale area. My king bed room was well-appointed and bathroom amenities were of good quality. Most of the staff was cordial and helpful.However, here are the negatives I experienced during my stay:- The front desk was willing to cash my traveler's checks with a very high fee, but could/would not, on 3 separate occasions, break a 20 pound note.- The Tea Tray in the room was a wonderful surprise but when I took the lid off the teapot to fill with water I was met with a horrendously foul odor. It obviously had not been cleaned in some time.- My room was located on the 2nd floor and a noise which sounded like a banging door permeated the walls/windows. Thank goodness I had earplugs.- Bathroom is very tiny but workable. Shower did not have a curtain but rather a partial glass panel that no matter how careful I was, there was always a pool of water around the tub. Don't know if I would ever return to to Chesterfield.

<Content>Wonderful stay To celebrate my 60th birthday decided to stay at the Chesterfield again. Not disappointed at all. Just as memorable as our stay last October. Our room, although small, was absolutely spotless and elegantly decorated. The bar was equally impressive but rather expensive (this is Mayfair though!) Staff extremely courteous and helpful from arrival through to the point of leaving. Hotel is well located for theatres, shopping in Oxford Street and Bond Street nearby and within easy walking distance of Hyde Park. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a stay in London - good position, friendly staff and a wonderful experience overall.

<Content>Great experience Stayed here for the St Patrick's weekend and we really loved it. Booked the room via the Chesterfield Mayfair website and received a complimentary bottle of champagne, English breakfast every morning, afternoon cream tea and a 6pm check out for the same price that hotels.com offered the stay not including any extras. Papers and magazines are provided in the room. All the staff is very attentive and professional. The location is second to none. It is located a couple of blocks from the Green Park tube station. A quiet area, but close to both Leicester square and also close enough to Buckingham Palace and the West End. Great value for money!

<Content>Wonderful I have stayed twice and several friends have also stayed there. All agree that it's excellent. Annual (at least) travellers to London, we have all tried various hotels around the city and this is the best so far. Room size is decent and efficiently used although small by US standards (it often isn't in London especially compared to average US hotel room). Staff all speak very good English, even maids etc. (in some hotels in London only a couple of staff seem to be able to do more than say hello). Great neighbourhood - short walk to Picadilly, Regent Street and theatres. Covent Garden and Seven Dials also walkable (but you can always get a cab within a minute or two at most and the tube is close). Staff very helpful. Very nice formal Chinese food in modern setting across the street. After a series of London hotel disappointments spanning years, this was a delight and the second time was as nice as the first. Have three friends who have also stayed there and all agree. Too bad the pound is so high against the dollar or I'd go more often (have to wait for the company to send me again next year).

<Content>Great hotel Stayed here for St. Patrick's weekend.The room was not massive but what it lacked in size, it made up for in everything else. The location is top notch. I have never been as impressed with the local cars. If you fancy spotting Rolls Royce, Porsches and Ferraris then this is the area.Every morning, a newspaper was left hanging on the door. On the newspaper was a little sticker wishing a pleasant stay and details of the weather forecast.In the evening there was a turndown service with a nice bit of fudge and the tv was pulled out on its stand and angled towards the bed.The bathroom was nice with robes and underfloor heating, good cosmetics (speaking as a man), bath, shower and hose.I couldn't recommend the place more. Breakfast is 拢19.50 and an Irish whiskey to celebrate St. Patrick's day was 拢8 so be aware that it is not cheap but there were better deals on the hotel's website than on hotels.com

<Content>The Chesterfield was just right! I stayed at the Chesterfield for 7 nights just last week. My double room was perfect for me - not gargantuan, but I didn't expect that. But superb bed, comfortable chair and table, pristine, elegant bathroom and storage galore! As hard as I tried, I couldn't fill up all the closets and drawers! :) Quiet is very important to me - nothing annoys me more than voices, TV, music through the walls - and I might have been alone on my floor (but was not!).Make sure you get a rate with breakfast included - it's a deal - was my main meal of the day and couldn't have been more delicious or the service more impeccable. I was greeted by name in the morning after the first day or so. You order anything cooked you want off the menu, as well as help yourself to beautiful buffet with anything you could want as far as fruit, cereal, juice, pastries, cheeses and meats, etc. The best Eggs Benedict I have ever had and I've had 'em everywhere!I had room service every evening after my long (great) days of sightseeing and it always (7 nights out of 7) arrived before they said it would, and was graciously served and just right.Had a martini each late afternoon in the fabulous bar - comfortable seating, great munchies and people watching supreme - you get the feeling that this is one of the most popular gathering spots in Mayfair for local business people - oozes class, but very warm.I could go on and on. Reception and door staff friendly, kind and helpful. You can't pass an employee in a hallway without a courteous hello.You simply cannot go wrong. Only place I'll ever stay.

<Content>Charming and totally satisfying I have just returned from a business trip to London, having stayed at the Chesterfield. My company had a preferred rate at the hotel, and after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I decided to try it. My experience was completely positive, and I know I will be back. My room was on the small side, but beautifully decorated and had a very functional desk with high speed internet access for using the computer. There was no small table or reading chair, so if using the computer is not a priority, I would ask for a room with different furnishings. In contrast, the bathroom was surprisingly large, with tub/shower, and nice vanity space around the sink. The hotel is a converted townhouse on a quiet street, so there are no views to speak of. This is more than made up for by the intimate atmosphere of being a guest in a large private home, and the hotel's proximity to Berkeley Square, and Piccadilly. The staff were all very friendly, and helpful. I tried the Butler restaurant with my colleague from work, and we had a wonderful meal. Both of us took the menu of the day as we were heading off to theatre and only had about an hour to squeeze in dinner. The staff was very helpful in making sure we got all the courses in time, and my only regret was the food and accompanying glass of wine were so good that I would have wanted to linger and enjoy longer. Green Park tube stop is the closest tube stop, offering 3 tube lines to get you anywhere you need to go. It is a healthy 5-6 minute walk though, but there are plenty of taxis to be had in Berkeley Square just down the street from the hotel. There are plenty of people out in the area until at least midnight, and I felt safe as a single female walking back from the tube from evening dinners/shows.

<Content>Excellent little Mayfair hotel! We visit London a couple of times a year and this is the first time we have stayed at the Chesterfield. It is in Mayfair in a quiet street away from the tourist crowds but very close to Hyde Park , Green Park tube station and the West End for the shops. Slightly farther away from theatreland, but not inconveniently so. There are a number of small restaurants and pubs around locally at various price points so plenty of choice. Also there are a variety of local shops in the area so everything is very convenient.Having stayed in many mid market London hotels, we were very impressed. Our superior room was slightly small but packed full of all you could possibly need for a weekend in London. It was immaculately clean and in very good order. Staff are extremely friendly and courteous - almost scarily so at times, but that's a fault we could put up with! The bar area is welcoming but somewhat smoky although our laws will sort that out in July when there will be no more workplace smoking....and there was one or two entertaining incidents with guests and their lady guests to people watch! It was quite a soap opera with various non resident friends arriving to join a group of men much to the consternation of the Chesterfield's staff! The rest I will leave to your imagination - but I have to say they handled it all very well!Breakfast is very good - I have had better but not in London! Freshly cooked hot food not left buffet style on hot plates, and an excellent cold buffet set us up well for our days of fun!So what more to add - would we go back , yes definitely and there is no question for what we paid ( 拢180 ish a night at the weekend) this was excellent value for money for this part of London. We stay in Radisson Edwardian group hotels usually ( eg Mountbatten, Hampshire etc) and whilst this is of similar style and approach it definitely pips them at the post!

<Content>Great hotel What a nice hotel! Compared to some other hotels in London, which are as expensive (Thistle hotels for example), the Chesterfield has real class. The decor is really special.Rooms are lovely (although quite small), and the staff is wonderful (they are all well trained and focused on customer satisfaction).The only small thing which is wrong is that they charge 拢4.50 for each little bottle of water (33cl) they put in the room, and you don't know anything about it until you pay your bill. Can be a nasty shock if you stay for a few days!I strongly recommend their afternoon tea, their scones are fantastic!Bar and restaurant are expensive: 拢9 for a GT, and 拢12.50 for a glass of champagne... but what else can you expect in Mayfair ?Overall an excellent hotel. Will definitely go back for my next stay in London.

<Content>Superb Hotel... sheer luxury My husband  I stayed at the Chesterfield in November for his 30th  I can honestly say it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in ever!

We didn't have dinner at the hotel but the bar was very luxurious (as is the rest of the hotel)  breakfast the next morning was lovely. The hotel staff are very polite  proffesional  the hotel is in an ideal location for visiting the sites in London, 2mins to green park  buckingham palace  5mins to new bond street  shopping heaven!We will definately stay at this hotel on our next visit to London.

<Content>Nice stay We spent last weekend at the Chesterfield in celebration of our first wedding anniversary. We arrived to our room which was pleasant but perhaps not as luxurious as we would have imagined, but never the less clean and comfortable. Awaiting us was champagne on ice along with some chocolate dipped strawberries, yummy! All the staff that we encountered were very friendly and made us feel very welcome. We had our evening meal in the Butlers restaurant which unfortunately we were disappointed with and it was very expensive for what it was, there is also a higher than average service charge added to your bill (12%) but again all the staff were very nice warm, friendly and welcoming. Breakfast was lovely with a buffet style continental, lots of fresh fruit, pastries etc and freshly cooked hot food to order which was delicious. The chesterfield is in a lovely part of London, extremely quiet and close to many of the attractions. I think it was good value for money and I would consider returning, we did have a very nice romantic weekend and came home feeling relaxed and refreshed.

<Content>Our 40th wedding anniversary. We chose this hotel from a shortlist prepared by my eldest son(who works in London) and tripadvisor comments by previous guests, for a special break to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. We would like to thank previous reviewers in guiding us to make such a rewarding choice. We had a superior king room on the second floor in a quiet non-smoking location and we were not disappointed. We stayed four nights and the service we received was excellent throughout, there was a genuine friendliness from all the many staff we met (a credit to staff selection and training). The quality of the breakfeasts were superb, freshly prepared food, in unlimited quantity and plenty of choice. Due to other committments we only had one meal in the evening, this was also superb but somewhat expensive,although I did note that there is a 20% reduction if you have your evening meal a little earlier,( perhaps before most people would want 5.30-6.45pm). We saw The Sound of Music, an excellent show,we returned to our room to experience the hotels excellent turn-down service,we were delighted. The location for us (I am not too mobile) was again a good choice since it enabled us to walk to a number of famous attractions nearby. However we did hire a number a London cabs during our stay, many from just outside the hotel and without exception they were friendly and informative. All in all a wonderful experience throughout and a big thankyou to all concerned.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I arranged a trip for several customers to London for a one night stay at the Chesterfield and and a visit to see Cirque Du Soleil. The reception area was very impressive and reception staff upon arrival were attentive and very efficient, having all my party booked in within 15 minutes. The evening meal was booked at the restaurant and due to our tight schedule I asked the Maitre D to ensure the service was prompt. This was no problem at all , the service was superb and although unhurried allowed us to meet our other date. The standard of the common areas as well as the bedrooms was very good with all the usual extras you associate with a quality hotel. If i had one slight moan it would be this. Knowing that over the weekend my company would spend on rooms, food and drink in excess of 拢1400 I enquired as to a free room upgrade on that basis only too be asked for a further 拢160 per room upgrade fee. Call me tight if you like but I thought that was a little short sighted. Had that request been met I would have had no complaints whatsoever.

<Content>Polite Mayfair Hotel This hotel really does seem an incredible deal in upscale Mayfair, with the Ritz, the Connaught and Claridge's all nearby neighbors. My partner and I checked with the hotel directly through their website, and got a great rate including an English breakfast for under $350--that with the exchange rate so terribly bad these days. The front desk service was incredibly efficient and polite; the maid service was prompt; the turn-down service a nice touch; and the very nice inclusive breakfast was the perfect way to start a day of sight-seeing. As a tourist visiting for four days, the Chesterfield really offered a glimpse into what a sophisticated, upscale, hospitable city London can be. The hotel is convenient to the Green Park Underground stop, and with Shepherd's Market offering a variety of shops and cafe's nearby, and Bond Street and Oxford Street also within easy walking distance, one could spend an entire day shopping very close to your hotel. And while you're staying at the Chesterfield, go ahead and have dinner nearby at The Square--one of the best dinners we have had anywhere. Just a great experience in this part of town, staying at the Chesterfield. We hope to be back someday.

<Content>Beautiful hotel We stayed for one night at the hotel on a theatre break, and it was perfect. It's immaculate, beautifully decorated in a traditional style, and the staff are friendly and attentitive.My mother and I were in one of the standard twin rooms, which although quite small was very comfortable, and had all the standard amenities and then some. The bathroom was also fantastic, with an excellent shower. The breakfast was delicious, with lots of choice - continental, full English, pancakes, etc...If you want a luxury hotel that's close to the West End and only a short walk from a tube station, you can't go wrong with this one.

<Content>Fantastic ..... and there is a totally smokefree real English pub close by.... We often stay in London and while we previously enjoyed the flash decor of the Soho, Charlotte Street and Covent Garden Hotels we had been less than pleased with their pricing and in the latter two - their lack of service so on the advice of Tripadvisor contributers we decided to try Chesterfield Mayfair. What a fantastic find. Thankyou everybody! The hotel is centrally located in classy Mayfair not far from Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street. If you are a keen jogger it is in close proximity to Green and Hyde parks. I would describe the hotel decor as English and in a style that was very welcoming. Our room was very nice although maybe not as nice as the ones pictured on their website. The bathroom was excellent and the all important shower worked beautifully. The staff were attentive and friendly (special mention to Walter the Italian waiter) and the food at breakfast and dinner was excellent. They quietly dealt with our non-smoking request in the dining room (I have a lung problem). There is a bar but it was far too smoky for us to enter. Fortunately we found a wonderful real English pub (The Running Coachman) just two minutes down the road which is totally smokefree......so we dropped in for a pint or two and some classy food and wine at very reasonable prices. Overall our stay at Chesterfield Mayfair was excellent and we will be back.

<Content>Good Experience at the Chesterfield Just got back from a wonderful stay at the Chesterfield. The room we were given on the 4th floor wasn't quite what I expected and at my request they moved us to a room on the 7th floor. Small room but, this is London. The staff were all very nice. I was a bit bummed that for roughly $400.00 a night breakfast wasn't included. We arrived on an early flight and only had to wait for about a half an hour for our room to be available. The concierge desk was sub-par. Very vague with directions...got us lost quite a bit and they failed to mention a virtual trove of restaurants hidden down a nearby alley...my husband found while taking a stroll so my way of thinking says they had to know about it. Not very knowledgeable about restaurants, prices, etc. Next time i'll do more research on my own. All in all a wonderful time though.

<Content>Loved the Mayfair! We stayed at the Mayfair in September 2006 for 3 nights. My wife and I enjoyed our stay. We thought the location, service, and quality of the room were great. The only complaint we have is watch out for the slippery tub/shower, we almost took a spill a couple times. Other than that we loved it.

<Content>A bit of heaven in the heart of Mayfair The Chesterfield Mayfair is a bit of heaven tucked away in the heart of busy London. On a quiet corner, this charming hotel is well-appointed, has a friendly and helpful staff, and is a wonderful place both to stay and to dine. The decor of the rooms is elegant and yet not flashy. We stayed twice on our visit, on our way and returning from Scotland. Both rooms were beautiful and very comfortable. The service by all staff members was especially noteworthy. As an example, we wanted to try to get tickets to see Billy Elliot on Saturday night but all seats were sold. Our concierge, Ian Travis, not only secured two seats but they were center front orchestra. By the way the play is highly recommended. We would definitely stay at the Chesterfield again and would be glad to suggest it to others.

<Content>The Staff Goes Above and Beyond The amazing staff at the Chesterfield made our stay truly wonderful. After we booked our stay on the hotel website, they sent us a preference form for us to request what special ammenities we wanted in our room. That alone had us excited about our visit. They arranged for a private car to pick us up at the airport (and return us at the end of our trip) - a splurge I would recommend to everyone traveling with luggage. We arrived at 9:00am London time, a good 3 hours before check in, intending to request that they stow our luggage. Instead, they checked with housekeeping and had them make up a room right away for us while we waited in the bar and they brought us refreshments. We loved our room. Very warm and comfortable. The bathroom was bright and very clean and had a very special feature. A heated floor! I want one at home now. The room was always clean when we returned from being away, and the turn down service every night was more than just chocolates on your pillow. They pull the TV out, turn down the bed, open the TV guide and put the remote and room service menu out for you. They made sure you had full bottles of water and clean glasses. One night the assistant manager had left a bottle of wine for us for our anniversary. Every detail was seen to beyond our expectations. We had dinner in Butlers one evening and the food was wonderful. The restaurant manager and our server were fabulous. We really enjoyed them and didn't want to leave. My husband planned a special secret day for our anniversary and the concierge and assistant manager of the hotel helped him plan and execute every detail including hiring a private car to take us to Waterloo station to send us to Paris on the Eurostar and have lunch in the Eiffel Tower. They were just as excited about it as if it was their own special day. They were more concerend that we have a fabulous time and everything turn out perfectly then we were. Normally we like to try new places and don't go to the same place twice, but the Chesterfield is very special. I can't imagine coming to London and not staying here. Thank you so much for a great vacation friends!

<Content>romantic weekend stay My wife and I booked the Chesterfield based on recommendations gleened from tripadvisor and other web sites. We were very pleased with our stay from the moment we got off the underground stop (green park) and found ourselves in a nice area of london not far from picadilly circus, buckingham palace and other attractions. The hotel staff was very professional, attentive and courteous. The room, smallish by American standards, was comfortable and very clean. The bed was turned down every night, with a piece of fudge left on the pillow, bottled water on each night stand, and the tv remote/tv guidebook neatly left on the bed . For what we paid to stay here I expect nothing less than what we got, and we got what we expected!Would recommend this hotel without reservation to anyone. Its central location was helpful and we ended up walking to nearby attractions instead of spending money on taxi service. Check out the little breakfast cafe just down the street to the right of the Mayfair (near Starbucks) its called Katies and had a very good full English breakfast for only four pounds....great way to start the morning!

<Content>We'll return to the Chesterfield! My husband and I enjoyed a four night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair in the middle of September, and we would love to return. I have stayed in many wonderful properties in London, and always prefer to stay in Mayfair whenever possible. The Chesterfield is a superlative combination of location, service, and value. When we arrived at the hotel (in the car that the concierge had arranged to pick us up from the airport--an unusual splurge for us), we were met by a very gracious staff. Our room was upgraded to a theme room, and as many other reviewers have mentioned, the theme rooms have a great deal of quirks and character. We were in The Library, which is fitted out like a lovely old reading room lined with books on one wall--lots of dark paneling and appropriate accessories. While the room was a bit smaller than some London hotel rooms in which I have stayed, it had ample storage. The bathroom was wonderful (clean and spacious), and the shower was a delight! From check-in to our departure, the cleaning and turn-down service was top-notch, and indeed all of the hotel staff was always pleasant and efficient. I would echo the comments about the restaurant--wonderful food and considerate service. One evening we ordered the pre-theatre 3 course meal, and were too full to eat dessert. They actually allowed us to come back and have our dessert after we had been to the theatre, which was a very gracious touch!Another great thing about the Chesterfield Mayfair is the location. It is just around the corner from Shepherd's Market, which is a haven of sandwich shops and restaurants that are reasonably priced by London standards. There are many places close-by to grab an inexpensive breakfast if you do not have a breakfast option with your room (from full breakfast to a continental at Caffe Nero), and there are quite a few places for snacks and refreshments. From the Chesterfield Mayfair it is a short walk to Piccadilly for the theatre or Regent's Street shopping, and just minutes to the Green Park tube. Perhaps my only complaint with the Chesterfield Mayfair was the very high cost of internet access, but I suspect that is going to be true of London hotels in general these days. All of the options for connection were terribly expensive, and priced by either 15 minute or 1-hour increments (15 minutes was 3 pounds, I believe--on their computer; 1 hour was 12.99 for broadband connection in the room). I thought that I had read about wifi being available in the lobby and public areas of the hotel, but when I asked about this, I was told that I had to pay for the security key as per above. Ultimately we were able to work through this little obstacle, and will know what to expect next time we take our laptop to London. In summary, we heartily recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair, and look forward to our return visit. However, I hope that enough other folks decide that they want to stay somewhere else when it is our turn to go back so that we can get a room!

<Content>Could Not Have Been Happier We stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair from September 25, 2006 through October 4, 2006. There were four in our party, so we booked two rooms. I have made many previous trips to London, and have stayed in BB's, Le Meridien, The Marriott, The Grosvenor House, and The Savoy. After this trip, there is no question where I will stay on my next trip. I will definitely return to The Chesterfield Mayfair. The service was the best that I have experienced in London, the food in the restaurant (Butler's) was wonderful, and even the tea in the Chesterfield Mayfair Conservatory was super. Their scones were much, much better than the famous scones served at The Wolseley. The only thing they could improve on would be the firm beds. I found them a bit too firm, and would rather have a softer pillowtop mattress. I did sleep well, so it was not a major problem.Reviewer from Benicia, CA

<Content>A Very Comfortable Stay Stayed here for one night in late September and was very happy with the hotel. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived and the check-in was very efficient. We had booked a Superior King Room on the hotel website and, as we were staying on a Friday night, we were able to select a Full English Breakfast inclusive weekend deal from the options available. This cost us 拢139 plus taxes and was good value when one considers that we could have paid the same amount for the room without breakfast if we had chosen another option or booked through another website. The room was very comfortable, with fresh fruit, slippers, bath robes, bottled water and magazines provided and the CD player, iron and ironing board and internet connection meant we wanted for nothing. The staff throughout the hotel were excellent and the breakfast options were varied and of high quality. The location of the hotel was also great and I will certainly stay there again when next in London. I just wish we could have stayed for more than one night this time...

<Content>Excellent Service! I booked the Chesterfield Mayfair based on it's location and Trip Advisor rating. After a 3-night stay the week of September 11th, I would certainly agree it deserves an excellent rating. If you are ok with a hotel that is like a pair of comfortable old shoes, you will really like the Chesterfield. I certainly did! If, however, you are looking for huge rooms with a view in a contemporary large hotel, this may not be your first choice. Personally, I liked the clubby feel of the old Chesterfield and especially it's tremendous customer service. As mentioned in a previous review, Chris truly epitomizes this wonderful customer service. During checkout, I was thinking out loud about how I forgot to bring along some bottled water. Before I finished my checkout, Chris appeared with a glass, fresh lemon, and a liter of bottled water! My favorite was Loris Lucchini, the hotel's Restaurant Manager. Not only is Loris skilled in the art of excellent food service, but he has a terrific sense of humor, a real knack for making each guest comfortable and at home in the restaurant. I would hire him immediately if I were in the hospitality industry! By the way, I dined in the Butler's Restaurant three times and agree with other reviewers that the Dover Sole is worthy of it's high rating. Regarding the hotel itself, the keys are cleanliness, customer service, and convenience (the Chesterfield is in a perfect location in fashionable Mayfair). London is, of course, currently the 5th most expensive city in the world. With this in mind, I would enthusiastically recommend the Chesterfield to my friends as an excellent hotel and a real value.

<Content>Superb service My wife and I stayed here back in June largely based in the reviews here.I have to say the staff could not have been better. Extremely attentive without being intrusive. At check-in we were upgraded to a suite - as there was a wedding taking place and all the standard rooms has been taken this was a good start.Although classed as a suite it was quite small, but very nicely decorated (old Library), very clean and quiet.The hotel has an excellent bar, which although looks fairly formal, did not mind informal dress (hot day so shorts being worn).Breakfast the next day was included in the rate and was delicious. With a huge choice from the buffet and the English breakfast, hot and freshly cooked.Although the rooms are not the largest, it's the staff that set the Chesterfield apart. Location is also excellent, although only two minutes walk from Picadilly it was very quiet

<Content>Tiny, highly decorated expensive rooms and superb staff Of course hotel rooms are tiny in London, but the hotel makes an effort to overcome the problem with exquisite decorations. Still...at the start of a long trip, finding places to stow luggage for me and my husband was a bit tricky. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They were truly outstanding. After a long flight from Chicago and the trip from Heathrow to Mayfair, we walked in the front door and the reception woman greeted us by name! The location of the hotel is perfect . . . walking distance from all sorts of things yet on a quiet street. My only negative comment, except for the size of the rooms, is the irregular turn-down service, which never seemed to happen. The beds are great and the bathroom was first class.

<Content>Excellent hotel in quiet area My wife and I stayed at this excellent hotel near Berkeley Square in late August. We found the multilingual front desk staff very friendly and helpful. No problems with checkin and there was plenty of staff to handle the people checking in quickly. The room condition was outstanding, very clean and neat. The complementary bottled water was greatly appreciated. We often stay at the Rubens, a Red Carnation hotel, and found our room at the Mayfair a bit larger than the ones we usually get at the Rubens. The hotel is in a very nice, quite residential area only a 5 minute walk from the Green Park tube stop. Groceries can be bought a store between the tube stop and the hotel and there are several restaurants along a pedestrian street also between the tube stop and the hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, great value, great location I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair with my teenage daughter for eight nights in July of this year and we used it as a base for sightseeing in the wonderful city of London. I have only good things to say about this place. I will try to cover each of the bases. Location: could not be better. It is in the heart of elegant Mayfair on a quiet street that is only a 5 minute walk to the Green Park tube stop (where there are 3 central and frequent lines that converge here making it very easy to get anywhere in London). Also, if you are a walker, you can walk to many of the great sites and shopping from here as well. Also, the hotel is around the corner from a very convenient area called Shepard's Market, where there is always a choice of restaurants and a few shops. It was great to have this close by. We did not always want to be tied down to a dinner reservation, and we would walk back from the tube after a long day of sightseeing, and just pop into any one of these casual restaurants.Atmosphere: this is an elegant and very British hotel without being stuffy or snooty. The decor is elegant and it has the look of a five star boutique hotel without the five star prices. It is a small and intimate hotel -- so pleasant compared to some of the big chain hotels with their cavernous, busy lobbies. Everything is very well appointed and comfortable. One thing we were thrilled about is that the air conditioning always worked well (and good air conditioning -- in fact any air conditioning -- is a rarity in London). This was particularly important to us since the temperature was well into the 90's the whole time we were there. The only reason I have not given this hotel the excellent rating is that our room (and in particular our bathroom) was very small. I came to London prepared for this however -- this is par for the course in a London city hotel. The room was very quiet and the beds were extremely comfortable.Value: This is an excellent value. When I researched hotels for our trip, it seemed like everything in a comparable category was double the rate that we paid. This place is a find in a city that is outrageously expensive for Americans at this point. Also, since we were staying for an extended period of time, our full breakfast for two was included in the rate, and this was a huge savings ($72 per day to be exact). Service: is very personal, friendly and excellent across the board from the housekeeping staff (impeccable cleaning and restocking of the bathroom supplies, etc.), to the restaurant staff, the porters, the front desk, the doormen and the concierges. Ian, the head concierge, is very knowledgeable and was very helpful to us in planning our trip. I found that some of the staff who worked under Ian were not as knowledgeable, though always very polite and friendly. I had e-mailed several sightseeing questions to the concierge staff before my trip, and they were always prompt in responding. The reception staff kindly let us check out late on our last day which was tremendously helpful to us. One of the nicest little touches about the service at the Chesterfield is that they send you a preference sheet before you arrive with everything from the type of pillows you like to the date of your birthday. The Chesterfield is a wonderful and special find. I will definitely stay here when I return to London and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>superb! top notch! classy! I booked the Chesterfield as a treat for my dad and his fiancee for his birthday.They were overwhelmed with the hotel. I was a bit worried about the location and hotel as I had booked it but they said that I couldnt have picked a better location, they walked everywhere, its literally a stones throw to Buckingham Palace. We also booked them into mamma mia on the Saturday night and they walked there too. Their words described the Chesterfied Mayfair were - classy, top notch, luxury, a hotel in a bygone age, stylish. Staff could not do enough for them, plenty of staff and they all went out of their way to help them. The bar was lovely with a piano player on the saturday night, chocolates and water on their pillow on the turn down service. Breakfast was excellent (full english) which was included in the price of the room.  They were really blown away by this hotel and they thought it cost me a fortune (although I got a really good rate direct with the hotel).They have already planned to return to London again and will not want to stay anywhere else. I would certainly recommend anyone to this lovely hotel.

<Content>First Class Stay in London My wife and I recently had a 5-night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in London and had a wonderful (if expensive) time.The location was good for our needs. A 2 or 3 block walk takes you to Green Park station for the underground. Green Park, and of course Buckingham Palace are also nearby. There is a terrific pub (Red Lion) just 3 blocks away for probably the most reasonable food we had in that part of London. There are also many other pubs and restaurants in nearby Shepherds Market 1 block from the hotel.The standard room was supremely well-equipped and quiet, if small. The double bed was two smaller mattresses on a double box-spring, but very comfortable nonetheless. The bathroom was elegant, with nice features, but quite small. It did suffice however. I had to remind the staff 3 times about a water issue to do with the shower, but it was no big deal. The AC was good even with the very hot weather we had.The hotel has many places to eat, all of them expensive. Everwhere in London is expensive when it somes to food, but this hotel is not by any means a food bargain. It is very easy to spend hideous amounts of money here even if you don't drink. We ate in once and were pleased, but it was nothing special.There was no included breakfast.The staff, and there are many of them (lots of guys in uniforms standing around everywhere) were very efficient and friendly.Re value for money, it depends on what you want. We wanted a hassle-free stay and we got one and paid dearly for it. If you like to hang around the hotel and soak up the place, then it would represent good value for many. If you just want a place to sleep as you tour the town, you might do better for your dollar elsewhere.I would stay there again if I could afford it.

<Content>Elegance, quiet, and convenience We stayed at the Chesterfield 20 years ago and hoped that it would as good as we remembered. It was! The room was very nice of a good size for London, the lighting was the best of any hotel I have ever stayed, the bathroom was bright in blue marble, there were two closets so that we were able to stash all our luggage. We overlooked the lovely terrace of the English speaking socielty next door.The staff were fabulous, courteous and even funny. On making our reservations we were sent a preference sheet for type of pillow, bedding etc. You could order in advance any amenities. We requested that a car meet us at Heathrow. The hotel arranged it for a charge of 55 pounds which is close to the cost of a taxi which we would have taken. When we arrived at the Arrivals Hall the driver was there with our name on a card. We walked a few feet to a garage and a lovely gray Mercedes.The location is near Shepards Market and Berkeley Square, both offer exceptional opportunites for dinner. We ate at the hotel for breakfast which was terrific and for dinner which was very good as well. We stayed for two weeks and were able to walk to dinner every evening with great variety.We recommend this hotel without hesitation. Please note that we stay in hotels over 25 nights of the year for pleasure.

<Content>Fantastic .. hard to imagine better Stayed here 19th August for a trip to see Mamma Mia at Prince of Wales Theatre.What can I say? A gem!A quiet location - absolutely NO traffic noise or loud interruptions. We had a letter in our room when we arrived about a nearby party that night - very thoughtful - but if they were noisy we didnt hear them!.From arrival to departure everything was perfect. Desk staff were courteous and efficient not to mention downright friendly.Hotel was amazing .. really different in the boutique style .. felt like you were walking into a town house 100 years ago .. everything elegant and plush.Restaurants and bar areas were first rate and the food on offer for breakfast, lunch and dinner was simply top draw!Our room - Superior King - was really unusally decorated in a 'safari' style but tastefully so and as with everything else it was excellent in quality, cleanliness and design.In a nutshell, great hotel and will definitely return on my next trip to that part of London!

<Content>Good Hotel Our stay in the Chesterfield Mayfair was for a week. The concierge was very helpful and gave good recommendations for restaurants. The front desk staff was always very cheerful and friendly. The restaurant staff was talkative and made sure you had everything you wanted. But they were pretty slow at getting your food. The continental breakfast was good. All in all everything seemed nice. A very down to earth quiet hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, even greater service We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 4 nights at the end of a 3 weeks tour of England and Europe. We loved all of our hotels, but the service at the Chesterfield is beyond anything you can imagine. We arrrived a little early and one of our rooms wasn't ready so we were offered complimentary tea and cookies in the bar while we waited. All staff were always going above and beyond in anything they could do for us. We were in a Junior Suite which was very beautiful, spacious and comfortable. Our traveling companions were in a Superior King and it was also exceptionally nice. Bathrooms were large and clean with the usual amenities. Breakfast consisted of a buffet and also items you could order. We had their afternoon tea and were amazed at the selection and quantiy of items. Again, great service. We did eat dinner there once and it was also very good. Location is perfect, with Green Park Tube station within a short walking distance. Piccadilly Circus and all the theaters of West End a short walk also. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Look no further for a wonderful experience What a find for a London Hotel. Everyone member of staff we met was exceptionally friendly and courteous, from the moment we arrived we had first class service. We have stayed in many hotels in Mayfair but this has been the best. I agree that the rooms are not large, but everything you would want is catered for. We loved it and when we book again, which we shall, we will look no further, you cannot beat the Chesterfield for old fashioned English service, which is hard to come by these days. Well done!

<Content>Quiet and discreet We stayed at the Chesterfield on 10th July for two nights. The hotel met all our expectations. A very quiet and discreet location within easy reach of the west end and the parks.The staff were excellent and very obliging, especially in the restruant for breakfast, wich was an experience both in choice and quality.Our room was very clean and comfortable.The Chesterfield is a gemstone of a Hotel tucked away in Mayfair.

<Content>Highly Recommended! Would stay again We stayed at the C.M. for two nights following a long flight from Los Angeles. We could not have been more pleased with the hotel. The room was a bit small, but that is to be expected from European hotels. Everything was immaculate, well appointed, and the staff was absolutely fantastic. As one other reviewer said, we were treated like important guests from the moment we arrived.Location is perfect - quaint, quiet street, and we were near Shepard's Market, a small cul de sac of neat little restaurants, as well as within walking distance of Buckinham Palace, St. James Park, and the Thames (that's a bit of a trek, but certainly doable). Green Park tube station very close. Sorry, no good photos of the room. The others on the site do it justice.Our rate was 250 GBP total for 2 nights, including VAT and breakfast. This is their summer weekend special, and since breakfast is very expensive, I highly recommend getting it included in your rate if you can. Exceptional value for that price. You can get them to book a car to pick you up from LHR for about 50-60 GBP, I would use that service (although our guy had a hard time finding us at the airport).One note - we booked through Active Hotels, and there were two issues with that - 1) they got the arrival date wrong, and good thing I called ahead to confirm; and 2) each morning, the restaurant had to be convinced our rate included breakfast, but they fixed it pronto once they checked with the front desk. So maybe the restaurant has some issues.We would definitely stay again.

<Content>Even more than perfect ! We spend our 5th wedding anniversary at the Chesterfield Mayfair, and they made it an unforgetable moment for us!Everything was just even more than perfect!Everybody was so kind and helpfull. We have got a lot of little extra's and attentions. It is a very stylish hotel, nice room, beautifull restaurant, delicious food, cosy and comfortable bar, excellent service and most off all, superfriendly staff!The difference which makes the Chesterfield Mayfair, is that the people who work there do not only do their job for which they are paid to do, but they really put their heart and soul in their work to make your stay something special to remember.Congratulations to the general manager, the managers and the complete staff of the Chesterfield Mayfair, and many thanks!  Next time we come to London, we will certainly stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair again!

<Content>wonderful service We had a lovely stay on a Saturday night in June. True, our corner room had quite a lot of traffic noise and wasn't huge, but it was immaculate and the service was impeccable. The staff at all times were attentive without being irritating, and the room was cosy and comfortable. coming back to a well turned-down bed after a days gigging in Hyde Park, then ordering reasonably priced room service at midnight, was just great. Breakfast was fab and it's in a great position. We'd definitely stay there again, but may ask for a room at the back next time to avoid the traffic noise.Ps we liked the quirky decor, maybe not our choice at home but suited the hotel :-)

<Content>An Excellent Weekend Break Just spent the weekend at this hotel with my wife for her birthday. Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor I was really looking forward to staying and it didn't disappoint.The location was spot on in Mayfair and was a very convenient location for seeing London with the tube station 5 minutes walk away. The main shopping areas of Bond Street and Oxford Street were only 10 minutes, walk, and due the the fantastic weather we were having, that's what we decided to do.Our room was not the largest I've ever stayed in, but, it was the size you would expect and was certainly not cramped. My wife and I had plenty of room, for ourselves and all of her shopping (he, he he..). It was clean and well kept, and the evening turndown service was an added bonus.We found the room very quiet (2nd floor) and did not encounter any traffic noise. In fact, my wife did comment on how quiet is was considering we were staying in the centre of London.The Staff were very friendly and polite and where always around in the background, ready and waiting to help, whatever it may be.Our Room rate included breakfast and this was excellent. We certainly didn't go short and there was plenty of choice. With a selection of fruit, pastries, yoghurts, cereals and a traditional english cooked breakfast.In the evening after seeing a West end Show we retired to the bar, and enjoyed the cool relaxed atmosphere, whilst the pianist played in the background. It was a lovely end to a fantastic weekend break.A little tip: We booked via the hotel website which was the same price as other internet hotel booking sites, but included was a free bottle of wine. This was remembered at check in by the desk clerk and we were duly asked when during our stay would we like the wine.

<Content>Chesterfield Mayfair recommended highly I choose the Chesterfield Mayfair from July 5 鈥?July 8 with family during 2.5 week vacation in Europe. The Chesterfield Mayfair is a fine hotel. Rooms are on the small side 鈥?no surprise. The most important thing for my wife and 2 teenage girls however, is cleanliness and comfort and the C.M. scores high in both categories. We were given rooms across the hall from one another (as requested) and though there was no view it was, at least, very quiet. Besides, we did not choose the hotel for its view.An odd design flaw in the shower, however, is the partial glass enclosure. I would like to meet the designer who put this together; it simply doesn鈥檛 work well and it took careful planning and aim to keep from having large puddles on the floor because of this stupid enclosure! A minor inconvenience when considering the overall quality. Don鈥檛 forget, the English don鈥檛 place wash-cloths in their hotels. Pick up a pack at Wal Mart and simply use and discard as you travel. Our Paris hotel did not have these either. Yes in Switzerland.We found the hotel staff to be exceptional without reserve. We were treated like important guests from our arrival with our large bags to our early departure. Though not able to check in at noon as requested, we were able to do so at 1:00. We were always greeted with a smile wherever we saw a staff member. Excellent recommendations for travel about London and finding what we needed locally.There is an internet access point (computer) on the lower level and time can be rented. I took my laptop and my teenagers were able to keep up with friends by the in-room DSL access points (Around 15 GP per 20 hours.) Sullivan鈥檚 market is no more than one block away with access to several small restaurants, pubs a 鈥減ost office store,鈥?and small pizza place. A few steps further is a Nero鈥檚 coffee shop (like Starbucks) and a small market store where we purchased wine, water  breakfast food including fresh bread each day.We highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair and should we return to London, will likely stay there again.

<Content>Boutique hotel without bragging about it.....? We arrived on the hottest July day in London in nearly 100 years and the pavement was sizzling. The cool classy cosy reception area was very welcoming. However, we were disappointed that at 10 past 2, having checked the day before by telephone what time we could check in, we'd been told any time. In fact our room was not ready and we were asked to wait 15 minutes as the last occupant had only just vacated! In the end, our room was not ready until 3pm, which was annoying as we had a packed afternoon and would have preferred to have had a cooling shower before setting out again into the hot city streets. However, the apologetic receptionist offered us a complimentary drink while we waited in the bar which we initially refused, but as the wait continued, we accepted and ordered two cuppacinos, which then took a futher minutes to arrive! In fact they arrived just as we were told our room was at last ready for us! We only had hand baggage but we were not asked if we wanted any help with our bags - but to be fair, the staff were wearing formal attire and were probably even hotter than we were. So we were not off to a very auspicious start. However, without being asked (and even before the delay ) we had been up-graded to a themed room. We were delighted to be shown to the Music Room, which is exquisitely decorated - an absolute peach of a room and bathroom. The staff were all delightfully friendly and reflecting on the unfortunate first impression, it is only because they were so laid back in the first place - presumably telling the previous occupant of our room he too didn't have to vacate by any particular time, that we weree slightly inconvienienced. Given she managed it in about 40 minutes, the maid did a great job! This aside, we would definitely stay there again and found it very restful, and slap bang in the heart of Mayfair. I am now looking for a loo seat in the shape of a cello! On the way out, laden with shoppijng bags, we were not ioffered a hand to the taxi either - but then it was the second hottest day and they were still in their hot suits while we were in shorts and tee shirts.Barbra Streisand had signed the guest book two weeks earlier - don't know if she really did stay here but lots of Americans do and you can see why they really rate it. Classy and classical and very understated. If there were any businessmen here, they kept very quiet !

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Just got back from a four night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair with my fiancee. It is a fabulous hotel in every way that we experienced. The staff were all polite and helpfull and the concierge was fantastic.The rooms were absolutely beautiful. No idea what the other guy was talking about. Our bed was extremely comfortable. The TV reception was great, especially for watching World Cup games when we were tired from sight seeing. The cleaning ladies did great jobs and there was even a nightly turn down service which was fantastic. No problems in any way. We even took advantage of getting breakfast delivered to our room and enjoyed that tremendously.The hotel restaurant is also incredible with terrific service and great food. The Green Park metro stop is just a few blocks away which makes for easy access to all the rest of London.Really there is nothing negative I could say about this hotel. It is located away from noisy streets in a beautiful area of London. Again, I have no idea how the other reviewer heard traffic noise as there are no busy streets near the hotel for at least three or four blocks. I can't compare this hotel to others in London, but for the price I thought it was totally worth it.

<Content>Not exactly what we expected... My girlfriend and I booked in to this hotel for a special night's break on 23/07/06. We chose it based mainly on the other reviews on trip advisor, booked directly through the hotel and paid to upgrade to a superior double room. I'd advise anyone looking to do the same thing to sort these reviews on rating low to high and have a read (I don't see any exagerations in them).We arrived and checked in without any trouble and were escorted to our room by a very friendly bellboy. The reception and ground floor public areas looked very nice.However, the (first) room we entered was very small - there was a 4ft corridor round the bed, a dest at the foot of the bed, small fitted wardrobe and a TINY bathroom. This would have been cosy as a single, but there was no way two people could walk past each other in it. Also the threadbare carpet had bits on it and the 'decor' was many dark portrait paintings of mens' heads.When we returned to reception they offered to show us two other rooms. Both were the same size as the first, in the same worn condition with varied 'interesting' decor. These suposedly superior rooms (dread to think what the standard were like) were nothing like the website pictures and we really didn't want to stay there anymore. Back at reception and the girl was no longer interested in giving good service. If we wanted to leave we would have to pay anyway (which is their policy for one night). Also when we mentioned room size she pretty much asked what we expected for that sort of money in the mayfair area, and didn't seem to care about the trip advisor ratings... not exactly customer service. Also tried to charge 拢7 for a 45 minute internet card!I know other people have loved this hotel, but for the cost of a weekend away somewhere, I'd take the weekend over one night here. We ended up leaving the hotel and found a room in the city (twice as big and half the cost) on a last minute booking website in an internet cafe!

<Content>What a disappointment! I was relieved to read the review dated 15th July regarding this hotel. I have to say that I agree with the view that this hotel is certainly not as great as the previous trip advisor reviews have suggested.I booked the Chesterfield Hotel following personal recommendations from my family who had used the hotel regularly in the past when staying in London. As I had an event in London, I decided that this would be a perfect place to stay. My boyfriend and I paid 拢159 for a superior double room which for the money, we expected to be comfortable, and something quite special. When we saw the room, we were shocked. I had expected it to be fairly small as this is normal with London Hotels, however the decor was quite tacky, the carpet was worn and didn't look as if it had been hoovered properly, and you could barely walk around the double bed due to lack of space.We asked for another room and were taken to a different floor where we were shown a practically identical room (except for a different colour carpet and wallpaper.) We visited reception and asked what our options were as there was no way that we would pay 拢159 for the rooms we were shown. We were informed that if we were not prepared to pay more to upgrade, then we could of course leave and find another hotel but that there was a 24 cancellation policy, and consequently we would have to pay the 拢159 regardless.The receptionist asked us what we expected from a hotel for that money in Mayfair! This shocked me. When I asked if we could have a full refund due to customer dissatisfaction, she held firm and said no, replying it's business. As I had also booked a suite in August (costing 拢250) for my Father's 50th birthday, I informed the receptionist that I also wished to cancel this reservation. The receptionist went to speak to the Manager, and eventually we were able to leave with our money back. I do not honestly believe that this hotel is good value for money. I have stayed in many hotels of a much higher standard for less. I have no problem in parting with 拢159 if I believe that it is worth it, but this hotel is certainly not.Fortunately I had taken half a day off work which was meant to give my boyfriend and I a relaxing afternoon to relax and get ready for the event in the evening. Instead, we used it to search on Lastminute.com for another hotel! Eventually we found a 4* hotel in The City for 拢80 called Club Quarters. The room was at least twice the size, the staff were pleasant and we felt that it was good value for money.

<Content>Nice? Yes. Overrated? Certainly! What can I say? I was so looking forward to staying at this hotel, (with my wife), after reading the many reviews on Tripadvisor.I can only say that it was a bit of anti-climax.First the good points:The staff were brilliantThe location was superbThe price was very reasonable, given the location.Now the bad:The room was tiny and tired looking.The 'double' bed was the old two beds pushed together chestnut. Very uncomfortable - one bed hard - one bed soft.The room was the noisiest I've ever encountered in a London hotel. A 4th floor room and the sound of the traffic was horrendous. (Yes the windows were closed)No minibar!No free internet or wi-fi connectivity. Get with it guys - this is 2006.Terrible TV picture.I must add that I didn't eat or drink at the hotel so can't rate this aspect.I can only sum up by saying that I wouldn't stay here again. There's far better around for much less money. Harsh on the staff, who were as polite and attentive as you could imagine.Sorry guys but I can't buy that this is, at the time of writing, the second best hotel in London, according to the Tripadvisor ratings. Not even close in my book. Harsh but fair I'm afraid.

<Content>Excellent A warm welcome, excellent and thoughtful service, comfortable rooms, good bathrooms. A frriendly bar where a woman can feel relaxed on her own. Good nibbles with the drinks, and if you are entertaining friends they can lay on canapes too. From a business point of view, they have various sizes of meeting rooms which can offer more privacy than discussing business in the bar or restaurant.I cannot fault it. Well done the Chesterfield.

<Content>Very good, but not great... Just got back from a long weekend after staying at the Chesterfield with my wife, and obviously after reading the reviews here my expectations were sky high !In reality what you have here is a good quality, well located, reasonably priced (for London) hotel, but which could benefit from a little refurb, routine maintenance plus a liberal sprinkling of tlc.Yes the staff are genearally pleasant, yes the breakfast is nice, and yes the clientele and ambience are generally agreeable.However the rooms are VERY small, bits of fittings seem to be falling off all over the place, and the cushions in the bar area are sooooo tacky !Three quarters of the guests appeared to be North American, whom I expected generally to be more discerning than average. But even the Brits have standards -and I must say that this Brit in particular expected a heck of a lot more !Thanks for the experience Chesterfield - but there is plenty of room for improvement..

<Content>Fine courteous service and posh facility - with quirks We stayed 3 nights, June 5-8, our first time to London (1st time to Europe). We walked to the Chesterfield from Paddington Station, having taken the express train from Heathrow. We would like to point out, however, we didn't do enough homework: the Metro subway railroad (tube) would have taken us from Paddintgon nearly to the hotel door... We enjoyed the walk though. Warning to Americans: the British allergens are not to be underestimated. Both my wife and I got nailed nearly simultaneously near Hyde park -- we recommend pre-loading your systems with decongestant/antihistamine. At any rate, the Chesterfield staff was friendly and engaged immediately in service to us. Our room (the music room) was striking but small and busy, so we asked to look at another room. Staff quickly showed us the 2nd flr postage room -- we loved it. Plusses have been already documented well by others. We enjoyed a full English breakfast at the hotel restaurant (our $80 breakfast...). The restaurant host was 1st-rate all the way. Throughout our stay he and much of the rest of the staff remembered our names. This may be because we kept looking for ice! Yes, we know that is an 'American thing', but ice is ice and it was only to be had from the bar or via room service and we just didn't want to bother folks for such a triffle -- but staff gladly accommodated us. One other drawback was the lack of free internet. I'll just say it: I would prefer a room rate to include all the 'little charges': phone, internet, etc. I'd rather not have mutilple little charges. We absolutely loved the location. It is very near the Green Park tube station (day passes work for buses and tube-trains). All visitors should find the nearby Sheperd's Market: a small cluster/plaza of restaurants, delis, pubs, and more. We repeatedly went there. We highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair to everyone.

<Content>Best Value in London We stayed here in May this year and could not believe our luck! This hotel is fantastic value, absolutely beautiful rooms and is in the most convenient location. The staff are friendly and helpful. It is decorated in very English style.It is only a few minutes walk to GreenPark station, round the corner from the Ritz and only a short walk to Hyde park. It has an excellent choice of restaurants close by, where we chose to have breakfast rather than the hotel. Really should have a 5 star rating.

<Content>Outrageously Good - especially considering the price! Well i was the lucky guy who managed to get a night at this hotel for just over 拢22 - seriously! It's one of the best London hotels i've visited and knocks the socks off some 5* let alone 4* rivals. It's very traditional and i suppose that isn't to everybody's taste but i couldn't fault my stay.We'd only been in the room around 5 minutes and the receptionist that checked us in phoned to see if everything was ok with our room and of course it was a very short coversation. Rooms are beautifully decorated and imacculately clean as i expected, the bathroom was excellent and my friend adored the huge, rainshower. Turndown service was also a very nice touch that not all hotels make an effort to do as standard. We didn't get to try breakfast as we had a very late night so i guess i missed out there.Overall this is a fantastic hotel and very romantic. I thought it would be an ideal place to take a partner for an anniversary/special occasion - i just need to find the partner now!What can i say that hasn't been said already, if you're thinking about booking this hotel just go ahead and do it, you'll struggle to find better.

<Content>What a Great Experience! My husband and I had such a wonderful stay in this hotel. The room was clean and pretty, the staff friendly and welcoming, the location was ideal, and they really went the extra mile to satisfy. The hotel is located on a nice, quiet street (something hard to find in London) in the lovely Mayfair area (famous for great hotels, like the Ritz) and is close walking distance to Hyde Park, Green Park, and Piccadilly Circus. There's a tube station nearby too (Green Park Station) along with breakfast places and even a pub with pretty good food (as good as you get in England, anyway). The hotel is small, but has a very homey feel, and its one of the few hotels that actually allowed us to reserve a King Size bed, not just request one as a preference. To be honest, the view from our room left a lot to be desired (I think we were overlooking the air conditioning units) but we didn't really care. What we appreciated was the extra services they provided. The room came with robes to borrow and slippers to keep, and every night our beds were neatly turned down with the TV guide and remote laid out for us and yummy carmels on our pillows. They even put bottles of water by our beds, which we weren't charged for drinking, and when we first arrived delivered a platter of fruit to welcome us. And their room service menu had a number of affordable snacks you could order 24 hours a day which we definitely took advantage of (their sticky toffee pudding was really good, especially after a long day of sight seeing.)I would definitely recommend staying here and hope to someday come back myself. Especially for the price, you really can't do much better.

<Content>5 Star Service at 3 Star Rates It's maybe not fair to write this review now that I'm back in Los Angeles and mourning the end of our trip. But, the Chesterfield Mayfair was the best recommendation I've ever gotten from tripadvisor, and boy, was it a FIND. Never would have heard of it or known of it otherwise. The location is excellent. Just a ten minute walk across Green Park to Buckingham Palace. A twenty minute walk to the theater district on haymarket. Ten minutes to Fortnum and Mason, twenty to Harrod's. Twenty to the National Gallery. The hotel itself was very clean, great beds, nice rooms. But the staff is extraordinary. We felt we were coming home every time we got back from the day's travels. We would have a delicious sandwich or fish and chips in the bar, seated in the most comfortable couches and chairs, drink a pint, or have a delicious Belvedere martini. We had an excellent dinner in the dinig room one night, fresh roast pork with cracklin', and a chardonnay from the Hotel's vineyard in France, which was excellent. Our waiter, Walter, was awesome. This may be ranked as 2 stars less than the Ritz, and, having stayed at the Ritz, I can tell you, it's not as sumptuous, but the service and food was 5 star. And at half the price of the of the Ritz.Money-saving tip: Go directly to the Chesterfield-Mayfair website and check the prices against any of the bargain online reservation places. We saved about $50 a day by doing that.Money-saving tip #2: If you can, ask to have the room charged when you make your reservation as opposed to checkout. If I had done this, I could have saved myself $1000, due to the falling dollar between the 7 months I reserved the rooms and actually paid for them.

<Content>genuinely friendly staff giving first class service This hotel is a little gem in Mayfair within 5/10 minutes of Picadilly Circus. What make this hotel is it's staff - all very friendly and anxious to help their guests. A conversation in the bar with what we thought was another guest was in fact the general manager enquiring about our day. Help and concern for one of our party who was taken ill was top class and while it was a hotel it felt much more personal. The bar, library, restaurant, lobby are small intimate and tastefully decorated which give them character. The room we had was very well decorated with a relatively large ensuite with heated floors. The common theme of the reviews on TripAdvisor as also of a book in the lobby inviting guest comments was consistent and that it is the staff that make the Chesterfield. This is why it ranks so highly on TripAdvisor and I agree whole heartedly. Thank you TripAdvisor for helping us find the Chesterfield and thank you to everyone in Chesterfield and in particular Alex, Armand,Kayleigh and the Night Manager.

<Content>Fab Location, stunning service  We travelled to London for four nights on an Easter weekend break and I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. Having stayed in an unmentionable hotel in Canary Wharf for the first two nights ( the worst experience in a hotel in any country by far), we arrived at the Chesterfield in the morning about eleven and although our room was not ready we were greeted by charming staff and were shown to the beautiful piano bar where we ordered a lovely brunch. I had called ahead the day before to see about theatre tickets for the weekend (as it was a busy weekend the show we wanted to see was sold out) and Ian the concierge went to every length to secure tickets for us - he was so professional and from the moment we spoke to him, we knew our stay in the Chesterfield was going to be top class. Each time we ordered a simple mineral in the plush bar we were given complimentary Olives  Bombay mix to enjoy with our drinks and the Bar staff were so pleasant and professional. While waiting for our room, the manager came over to welcome us to the hotel and all the staff did a little courtsey each time they dealt with us! The hotel was in a perfect location, a five minute walk to Oxford Street and all the best Restaurants and Sights that London has to offer were close by. We stayed in one of the suites, and we didnt want to leave the room! It was beautifully decorated and had all the little extra touches that make it that bit more special - bathrobes, slippers, umbrella, big bottles of mineral water by the bed, Canopys brought in and the bed turned down each evening. As part of our Easter special offer we also had afternoon tea in the conservatory restaurant on Easter Sunday, a lovely experience. We got our tickets to the show in the end and booked dinner in the Restaurant on the last nite, it was the most beautiful meal ever, served with such detail by the most pleasant and friendly staff we've ever come across.Will stay no where else in London ever again! This hotel should be awarded 5*status.

<Content>wonderful staff! Great hotel - Ive stayed in some fab places in London over the past 12 months. This hotel has the best staff by far! very friendly, nothing is too much trouble.The bar has a feel of an old fashioned gentlemens club, and the cushions of pictures of dogs isnt really my taste! Ok its not in the Sanderson league of chic, but youre made to feel welcome - the staff offer you plenty of complimentary nibbles! Would have got a 5 out of 5 from me, but we stayed in room 608 yesterday and it was really noisy - next door there must be an ice making machine, or air conditioning or something as the hum was quite loud and there were lots of rattles and vibrations.Normally, I would have given the hotel the opportunity to sort, but we didnt get into our room until 2.30am in the morning and were getting up at 6.30. Being so tired it meant that it didnt really cause us a problem - but had I been staying there for a few nights or having a sensible (how can you do sensible in London?!) early night, then it would have done.Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful! We recently took our first trip to London having no idea where to stay. Many of our friends and relatives suggested all types of hotels in all parts of London. We went with the suggestion of a friend whose taste mirrors ours.Staying at the Chesterfield Hotel, in Mayfair, London, was a great decision. It's a small, old world, intimate hotel with every possible modern convenience. The room was beautifully decorated with two phones, TV, internet access, fax, etc. The bathroom was right out of a magazine.The staff was very attentive, professional and well informed.The location couldn't have been better. It is located a few short blocks from the Underground, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park.I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.

<Content>Cheers From Chesterfield My wife and I spend 3 awesome days exploring central London with the Chesterfield-Mayfair as home base. This hotel was recommended by a friend. Neither of us had ever been to London. After arriving at Heathrow we got a rental car and drove to Southhampton and the Isle of Wight for a few days. Returning we took some excellent advice, ditched the rental car and took the tube to the Chesterfield (Picadilly Line to Green Park). It was easy, even for newbies. The staff at the hotel was great. From the traditionally dressed doorman, the helpful front desk (whom we exercised to upgrade our room), the concierge that got us theater tickets, the woman in the restaurant that got me a proper English breakfast every morning, to my favorite, Chris. Chris helped us plan out our attack on London. I'm afraid we occupied way too much of his time. Pestered him with tourist questions, asked his advice about this and that. He was always cheerful and willing to help, epitomizing the English gentleman. Even when he was off work and walking away from the Hotel, he stopped and chatted. If you want to do everything in the tourist brochures, the Chesterfield is located perfectly for it. Close enough to walk to many things. The subway is easy access. Taxi's readily available. Yet it's a couple blocks off the beaten path so it's quiet and charming too. I can't wait to go again. I regret not ever using the restaurant, but there were just too many pubs to try.

<Content>Wonderful stay, wonderful staff, charming hotel We have just returned from a stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair, ending our trip to the Uk there. It certainly deserves the reviews we read on Trip advisor, having chosen the hotel primarily because of those reviews. The staff is simply wonderful, could not have been more helpful in planning things to do, making recommendations for dining, transit etc. The rooms are very comfortable, well furnished and spotlessly clean. We did have a bit of traffic noise with the location of the room, but it was not too bothersome and really cannot be helped. The bathrooms are spotless, well supplied and have lovely heated marble floors. We had a king room and a twin room down the hall for 2 teens. The rooms are serviced morning and evening, with water placed at the bedside each evening along with the television guide and even a snack menu and slippers placed alongside the bed! We dined in Butlers restaurant and the food was excellent, with a fixed price menu option for 2 or 3 courses. Service was again outstanding and the staff was very abundant, professional yet very friendly, taking time to chat with us. We did find breakfast extremely expensive, we are not big eaters in the morning, so the continental buffet at 16.95 each was too much for the amount we had, there were a number of small cafe places nearby when we were setting out other mornings for sightseeing etc which suited us a bit better. We had drinks in the bar which was charming and had an excellent pianist which we enjoyed.Overall, for staff, location, comfort, we would definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay again.

<Content>Total Class i have stayed at the chesterfield mayfair a number of times on business. i find the service, throughtout the hotel, to be top notch. it is a warm and friendly environment where the management and staff aim to please their guests. they succeed. the restaurant is a hidden gem which i dine in regularly. however, the true testimonial is that i have brought a number of locals to dine here (Butler's Restaurant) for the first time and they are now coming on their own and bringing others. the location is very close to the green park tube station which makes getting around the city easy. you will be very happy you selected this hotel.

<Content>Loved the Chesterfield Three friends and I recently stayed five nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair. The service was excellent. All of the staff members we encountered couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. The little touches such as the daily newspaper with the weather report and daily newsletters from the hotel were much appreciated. My friend and I had a corner twin, which was large by European standards and the noise from the street was minimal. The only glitch, was that my other two friends, did not recieve the twin room we booked. (We booked two twins.) The staff did convert a king into two twins for them and it worked fine. I would not hesitate to stay there again and will recommend it to friends.

<Content>we will return... As our Easter trip to London was very special...we were extemely pleased with this hotel.Pleasant, professional, excellent dining recommendations even though we didn't have an opportunity to have dinner in their beautiful restaurant. We did have the traditional breakfast daily and it was excellent.the rooms were immaculate...very important to us as i have a bit of a phobia and my husband gets very picky about hotels as he travels for a living.the beds were made twice daily and the marble bathroom was spotless.The area was very upscale and great walking distance to many places...piccadilly, buckingham palace, westminster etc...Also some very nice little places right around the hotel for great Indian food or a cocktail.This will be an annual trip for us and we will indeed stay here.Michelle Hughes

<Content>World class hospitality My wife and I stayed for a long weekend to celebrate her birthday at the end of March/start of April 2006. I chose the hotel based upon previous comments here in Tripadvisor. I was not disappointed. From the moment you step through the door you enter another world, one where service is exceptional and every member of staff is warm and welcoming. In all my years I cannot recall a hotel offering a friendlier, more efficient service. Nothing was too much trouble.I had booked a table at a special restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday but after experiencing the excellent breakfast and (again) excellent service, we decided to eat in the hotel on our second night. Once again, the service was impecable, friendly and spot on. The food was excellent and easily equalled that of the night before (and was the better dining experience of the two).The room had a super kingsize Hypnos bed which gave me my best sleep in a long time (I slept so well, I lifted the sheets to check out the make!). The room had everything you needed and was a reasonable size, larger than some other London hotel rooms I have stayed in.I cannot fault any aspect of my stay at this hotel. It is run by very genuine and friendly people and I highly commend it.My only concern in making such a recommendation is that it sets the bar of expectation so high that some people may arrive expecting, nay demanding, the impossible. What I will say is that you will have a more personal, cosseted and welcoming experience than you would if you were staying in any large hotel chain. I do not believe it can be beaten - and, being fortunate enough to be able to spend several hundred pounds on a weekend break, I take no issue at having 拢1.00 ($1.75) added to my bill and matched by the hotel to go to such a deserving charity. Well done for raising nearly 拢100,000 ($175,000).

<Content>Snug twin I too booked into the Chesterfield after reading the reviews of others on this site. I think the problem with London hotels is that alot of people have booked them for a treat and so it was in my case - a night on the town with my mum before seeing Phantom (which is fabulous by the way)!Not a sniff of an upgrade - never a good sign I think of a high class hotel if one is not offered if they're not full. They gave us a double to start - now as much as I love my mum we don't want to sleep in the same bed. They then changed us to a Queen Bed which was basically two singles then made up individually, but not with so much as an inch between us. All this we were advised for no extra cost.Now the bar - how depressing and a lost opportunity. A miserable Spanish speaking waiter who didn't even look up and took ages to take a drink order - dreadful atmosphere only relieved once a young lady took over the running at 6 pm. Hint - don't go to the bar until the evening shift.As for quiet - yes, it's quiet outside, but the doors banging in the corridor was a nightmare. The hotel needs to add those gizmos that prevent them from slamming, it was like a college dorm.Maybe we're spoilt, but I'm not sure how much you have to pay these days to stay somewhere great, but it's definitely not here.Along with the hotel industry's new fiddle - making people feel guilty about having their towels changed daily, the final straw was the 拢1 for charity added to our final bill. If the company wants to pick a charity and give money to it - do it with its enormous profit. We all pay inordinate amounts of tax and are sick of being embarrassed into contributing to something we didn't agree to.

<Content>DELIGHTFUL stat I took my husband on a surprise weekend trip to London for his birthday, and chose The Chesterfield largely based on the wonderful reviews it has gotten on this website. We absolutely loved our stay at The Chesterfield Hotel! The staff is so warm, accomodating and impeccably mannered. What a wonderful way to start our weekend immersion in English politeness and refinement. Ian at the Concierge desk was so helpful and charming, and Valerie at the front desk was so endearing and sweet. Our room, although a bit small (as is normal in most European hotels), was very tastefully decorated in true English style. The marble bathroom was beautiful, large and spacious. And the breakfast! Ah the scrumptious English breakfast!! I couldn't wait for the morning to go down and have breakfast in their beautifully decorated dining room and conservatory. It was so delicious and fresh every morning we went down. Their cafe latte was to die for. Finally, last but certainly not least, is the hotel's PERFECT location in Mayfair. Mayfair is so beautiful and chic and so close to everything. Plus, the hotel is tucked in on this gorgeous, romantic, winding street. We couldn't have asked for a nicer one. We will never forget our weekend stay in London, and The Chestefield did wonders to make it even more special. I highly recommend it.

<Content>The Personel Touch I have recently had the great opportunity to stay at The Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in London on a business trip. But I have to say it felt more like a holiday.The exterior of the building did not do the hotel justis as once inside you are transformed into a tardis of a building like one I had never had the privilege to step into before.From the moment the door was opened for me the level of service was second to non.Attention to detail in all areas of both the rooms and the building itself to the attention from every member of the staff (maintance to front of house) and not to mention the first class food which was served at breakfast, evening dinner and throught the conference itself. The quality of the decor throught the building and including the public toilets and lifts is beyoned belief. Each bedroom was unique although I stayed in their standard accomodation, Ihave to say it was more then mere standard to me. There was sence of a personel touch as if the room had just been chosen for you. The fixtures and fittings within the rooms were a delight and sometimes quirky. This hotel had a very relaxed and laid back feel to it with busy London just outside the door inside was a haven to walk into. I loved the whole experence of staying at The Chesterfield Hotel and I will definitely return soon.

<Content>Great, Quiet location, Excellent service! I recently visited London with a friend on our return trip from Italy and stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for 2 nights. The hotel is on a quiet street in Mayfair, only a short walk from the nearest undergroung station and one stop from trendy Picadilly Circus. The staff was very efficient and helpful. The room was small but that was to be expected in London. To make up for the size of the room, every small detail was thought of from a GOOD hair dryer, stationary supplies (you never know when you need scissors and tape!) down to the handmade toffees left on your pillow during turndown in the evenings. The upscale Mayfair area is home to trendy bars and eateries only a few steps from the hotel. I would definatley recommend it for anyone travelling to London!

<Content>Great London experience! We stayed at the Chesterfield for 2 nights and it was wonderful. The service is excellent, the room had pretty much every amenity that you needed, and it's in a great location. We found an Easter special on their website, which included the room, one English tea, and breakfast for 151 pounds, and it also included the tax. Not cheap, but I thought a good deal, all things considered. London is an extremely expensive city, so be ready for the money to fly out of your pocket! The hotel is within walking distance to the Green Park tube stop, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park. Very nice area with restaurants and small shops. I would highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair, especially if you can find a package deal. I only wish we could've stayed longer!

<Content>Fantastic hotel! Our family of 3 spent 3 nights here last week, March 26th - 29th. What a treat! The room was tight (a King with a cot), but housekeeping kept it top notch. The bathroom was up to date, with a great shower and tub. We found all the staff friendly and helpful.The Chesterfield's restaurant is terrific! Breakfast was included with our room: it was first rate with a choice of food from a menu or a wonderful buffet. Loris the manager takes great care of his guests! We also enjoyed Dover Sole here one evening. It was fantastic. The Green Park Underground is a 5 minute walk from Chesterfield Mayfair. You can also access all the lovely London parks (near Buckingham) from the hotel for a great run. This is a very safe neighborhood.

<Content>Great Hotel, Upscale Neighborhood When selecting a hotel for London, the Chesterfield was an easy choice due to its excellent value and high ranking on TripAdvisor. The hotel did not dissapoint. After traveling overnight from the U.S., my wife and I received a warm welcome from the top-notch staff, but most importantly, our room was ready for us even though it was mid-morning. The rooms are small and traditionally designed. The marble bathrooms with rain shower heads were nice, but typically small. Everything was clean and appeared in good working order. By far and away, the staff is what makes this a great hotel, as they are very attentive and go above and beyond to help the guests. Before we left for Paris, the staff offered to investigate the latest on the student protests to see if we had any reason for concern. (Turned out the stike ended the day before)Of final note, the hotel is located in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in London. We saw more Bentleys, Rolls Royces, and Maybachs then we've ever seen before. About a block away through a small archway is a quaint area with about a dozen restaurants and pubs. Our only caution would be that London is the most expensive city on the planet, and with the falling dollar it's more expensive than ever. $8 beers and $15 hamburgers are not unusual, so bring lots of money. Overall, it's a great hotel and we would highly recommend it.

<Content>Fantastic place to stay In this deteriorating world of service, this is quite an oasis. The staff are friendly and efficient, standards throughout the hotel are fantastic, with very obviously well trained staff.Dispite being busy at breakfast, tea, coffee and toast arrived within 2 to 3 minutes of being ordered. Quality of food was great both in the Bar and Restaurant. Bedrooms are small but everything required is present. Go There!

<Content>Great place and wonderful service! We stayed at the Chesterfield for three nights. It is in a great location, very close to great restaurants and pubs (Sheppard鈥檚 Market is great), and is in a quiet location. The receptionists were very helpful and had our room ready for an early check in. We asked for an electricity converter and we weren't able to use it (the plastic stood out) so they had maintenance saw it off! Now, that is service!! We requested ice and they also brought that very quickly. They also accomodated us by allowing us to check out late on the day of our departure with no additional charge!The Chesterfield is a GREAT PLACE and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The staff, location, and service is wonderful.

<Content>Great Stay in London We spent 10 wonderful days at the Chesterfield Mayfair. All of the staff is friendly and helpful, the concierge desk helped with theater tickets, directions, train schedule to Windsor Castle, etc. Convenient location with simple access to taxis. Nice neighborhood. We were upgraded to the African Suite which was fun. The piano bar is charming, having afternoon tea is nice and the breakfast is good. Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>The Chesterfield Hotel - London/Mayfair - Superior Hotel My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in room 707. This hotel is magnificent. The front desk and the concierge were extremely courteous and just went out of their way to help us anyway that they could.The location of this hotel is excellent. Walking distance to Buckinham Palace, Saville Row, Piccadily Circus; just great!Our room was quite spacious and the cleanliness was wonderful! Our stay here was truly spectacular.JUST A TIP: There is a Pub/Restaurant just up the road called the Red Lion that our concierge referred us to: Excellent food and delicious ale! Try the John Smith Extra Smooth Ale - A tasty delight!

<Content>Service complete I wrote a review last Feb 21, 2006: Great location...at the end I was explaining that:I've forgot my scarf in the room and asked at the reception to send it back to me. ...actually I'm still waiting..Well, after the review I've been contact by the Management of the hotel that confirmed that my scarf was in their lost area section and the week after I've received it back directly at my office in Italy. So, thanks again to the good professional service of the hotel (excellent would have been if they would have thought to send it to the laundry before resend back to me..). Thanks also to Tripadvisor as well asit shown that is more and more an important service and community.

<Content>Practically perfect, but not quite. I'd like to echo most of the sentiments expressed in the general reviewers' love-fest over the Chesterfield Mayfair. The location was lovely, the food very good, the room itself wonderful. There were a few service/staff glitches, though, that keep it from getting the highest rating from me. First, our reservations were messed up. It was a minor thing, and fixed in a half-hour while we had tea in the lounge. While in the lounge, however, I was actually sneered at by a staff member for putting milk in my tea. The guy was quite old and crotchety and couldn't gripe at me to get off his lawn because there wasn't one, so he turned on my tea modification choices. Whatever, it was funny. There was also a snafu with our billing, however. It was easily demonstrated that they were in the wrong, and the correction did not take long, but the staff member who did so was very snotty and more than a little argumentative about it. In the attitude expressed by a couple staff members, and in the careless errors made in reservations and billing, the experience was not up to snuff for a hotel of this caliber.

<Content>Fantastic luxurious hotel We stayed for a weekend break in March. The hotel is ideally situated, in a quiet side street in the heart of Mayfair and close to Green Park tube station. The room was lovely and contained everything you could need. A phone call to the room 5 minutes after we arrived to check everything was OK in the room was a great touch. We enjoyed a delicious evening meal in the restaurant - they do have the best Dover sole in London as their website says. Breakfast in the hotel is also of the highest quality. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff. They provide the best service of any hotel I have ever stayed in. Absolutely nothing is too much trouble and everything they do is done with a smile. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

<Content>Valentine Weekend Break Wendy and Martin's stay at The Chesterfield Hotel on the weekend of the 10th  11th February 2006.This is a very smart hotel, the staff were courteous and helpful. Our room was on the 7th floor next to the lift, and we did consider asking to be moved. (We have a reputation for not always accepting the first room offered!) However, there was no sound whatsoever from the corridor/lift our entire stay. The room wasn't huge but had everything it should, the bed was very comfortable and we could open the window. There were tea and cofffee facilities and, when we rang for fresh milk on Saturday morning it was with us within 5 minutes. On Sunday morning we reckon they were waiting for our call and it was there in 2 minutes! The bathroom was small but had an excellent shower.Breakfasts were very good, with a choice of freshly cooked dishes to order. There was also a buffet which was regularly checked and refilled, with plenty of fresh fruit on offer.We didn't have the opportunity to try the restaurant, although we did sample a late lunch in the bar and this was also very good.This is a hotel we would certainly stay at again.

<Content>Fantastic Staff The service in this Hotel was second to none.All the staff were helpful,polite and efficient and this with the old fashioned ambience and air of quality about the Hotel made our weekend in London one of the best ever.It's not cheap but all the extra touches,such as a demisting mirror in the bathroom,bath robes,and the attentiveness of the staff made it worth while. The public rooms are beautifully presented with wood panelling and red carnations(the hotel's emblem) and the bedroom was very comfortable.We liked the fact that whilst the juices,cereals etc were self service the main breakfast was waiter served so it was fresh and hot.We also had an evening meal in the restaurant which again was superb.We will certainly be going to The Chesterfield again.

<Content>Oustanding hotel Wonderful small hotel in Mayfair, a few blocks form the Green Park underground stop. One block west of Berkeley Square, close to Bond Street, Oxford Street and Fortnum  Mason. The staff was extremely helpful, pleasant and a delight to deal with. Helped with theater tickets, restautrants and phoning. The third time we've stayed there and would not hesitate to recommend it. Moderately expensive.

<Content>Charming Hotel My 12 year old son and I spent 3 nights at the Chesterfield over the Presidents' Day Weekend. Taking the overnight flight from NYC, we arrived in the morning. While our room was not ready, we went and had a full English breakfast in the restaurant, which came with our room rate. Breakfast was fine, though some of the cooked breakfast items seems to be pre-made, institutional quality, foodstuffs. The restaurant staff was very hospitable and helpful, which characterizes the entire Chesterfield staff. The bedrooms are well appointed; nice sized, although our bathroom did not have heated marble floors. The non-smoking rooms were indeed non-smoking; not non-smoking rooms with ash trays, a uniquely European definition of non-smoking. The hotel is very well located, on a street which leads to Berkeley Square, admidst a number of embassies. The real selling point for the hotel is a staff that really goes out of its way to help.

<Content>Great hotel My husband and I spent 5 nights here in February '06. The staff was plentiful but not underfoot and a great combination of professional yet friendly. The concierge was everything we expected based on other reviews. Very helpful. Also, the restaurant food was very nice. The only drawback is the potential for cigar smoke, especially in the bar. We would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>A great hideaway in Central London We stayed at the Chesterfield for one night when we were in town for a party. It is tucked away on a guiet road just off Berkley Square within easy walking distance of New Bond Street. The room was small but incredibly comfortable and well furnished - no faceless chain hotel here. Everywhere was spotlessly clean and the staff were all very welcoming and friendly. We ate a snack in the lovely bar which was excellent and well priced for a hotel in this area. The only downside is the cost of meter parking outside the hotel but this isn't there fault!We will definitely be staying here again and thoroughly recommend it. Due to it's peaceful location and quiet ambience I would not suggest it would be great for boisterous children!

<Content>A disappointing experience I stayed at the Chesterfield beginning on Thursday, February 16th, and had originally planned on staying several nights. I picked this hotel based upon the Tripadvisor reviews. I obtained an initial rate of 178 pounds for a non-smoking king room. I arrived in the morning due to an overseas flight. The women working the front desk indicated I had originally been assigned Room 426, but it was not ready so she assigned me to Room 319. Room 319 was on the street side above the bar and rather loud (I am a light sleeper). I asked to be switched to a quieter room. The manager working the front desk offered to have Room 426 shown to me, which was nearly ready.Room 426 was quiter and slightly larger, though it only had a queen bed. I told the manager this would be acceptable, and he offered it to me for only 30 pounds extra per night! This would have been fine had it not been the same room I was told at reception was originally assigned to me. The women working the front desk lied and told the manager she never mentioned the other room to me, and he defended her. He actually cut me off from speaking, which was very upsetting; even if I had been wrong, this was truly poor customer service. It was only after I left the hotel altogether, and had mentioned to the manager I would relay my experience on this website, that he came after me several minutes later in the street and asked what he could do to improve the situation. I was offered Room 426 at no additional charge.Unfortunately, the room turned out to be extremely hot, and the thermostat did not help. I called downstairs, and they adjusted the temperature which wound up making the room extremely cold. I didn't sleep much as a result.The next morning, at 7am I checked out and switched to a different hotel, the Renaissance Chancery Court. Unfortunately, the same women who originally checked me in was at reception. She never bothered to ask why I was leaving, but at that point I didn't expect it. The Renaissance was not nearly as convenient as the Chesterfield, but the staff made me feel welcome and the service was consistently high quality.The Chesterfield has an outstanding location, and the bellman and housekeeping staff were exceptionally friendly. However, given my experience I would never return.

<Content>Valentine's escape I booked the Valentine package, see their website for details, this includes;- Red rose- Card- Selfridges voucher- Chocolates- Bottle of champagne- Disposable camera- Valentine dinner- Midnight feastUpon entering the staff do their very best to welcome you, after checking-in, reception called to see if the room was OK and asked if we needed anything else.The room was a little cosy (as expected in London), we had a classic double, everything was very clean, the bathroom in white marble, with a heated floor and mist free mirror. There was plenty of storage space, tea and coffee making facilities, hairdryer, plus everything you'd expect of an expensive London hotel.Dinner was in their resturatant, again the staff were very attentive, the food was great (from a special set menu).Didnt have time to try the midnight feast, but it sounded great. The only black mark, was the loss of our breakfast order, it was collected, as a newspaper was on the door in the morning, a quick call to reception fixed it.Overall a great way to spend valentine's day with your special lady.R  GPros- Quiet- Clean- Excellent staff- Location for London sites and shoppingCons- Lost breakfast

<Content>Very good Hotel, average restaurant We stayed in the Chesterfield for a short valentines break and we weren't disappointed. The standard room was not overly large, but clean and well appointed (although a little chilly to begin with). A courtesy call from reception after 5 mins was a nice touch. The hotel was quiet and the staff were very attentive. One disappointment was the restaurant. We dined there on our arrival night for convinience and the food was distinctly average, and overpriced (拢90+ for two starters, two mains, coffee and a bottle of wine). The wine list was comprehensive, but again, very pricey even for London. On this basis we didn't have breakfast throughout our stay, opting for the Pret round the corner.Overall a well located, clean, attentive hotel let down by an average restaurant.

<Content>Excellent Hotel! Excellent.... !!! The staff in the hotel are just sensational. I can not ever remember having such a welcoming and helpful group of people outside of a Japanese hotel - from the check in staff to the maids and housekeeping people this place is totally customer centric. It is a small boutique hotel with a quite good restaurant and a bar that is open 24/7. The rooms are small, but well appointed. And of course its location in the heart of Mayfair just a quick walk from Picadilly, Bond St, etc is not to be beaten. I will stay at this hotel again without any hesitation.

<Content>Better than hoped for!!! My wife and I spent four nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair - and did I make points for picking the hotel!!! Must admit - I made the reservations after looking at reviews on this site - and this seemed like the best value. I was on business and actually spent one night here a week prior to my wife's arrival just to make sure the reviews were correct - YES. We do not understand why it is not rated 5 stars - perhaps it is a bit smaller than typical 5 stars. We took advantage of their Mayfair Weekend special found on their website - check it out. Anyway - heated marble floors in the bathroom, wonderfully decorated bedroom, clean up service 2 times a day in the room, wonderful, cozy bar, absolutely WONDERFUL Full English Breakfast (make sure you ask for it to be included in your stay). The Maitre D in the restaurant could not have been more helpful. Have them deliver it to your room if you like. I tried to find a staff member who was not in a good mood - unable to - like a cruise - all in a good mood and helpful. Location is also GREAT. Located in a quiet area of Mayfair - highest real estate prices in London. A few blocks off beaten path - quiet. Walking distance to New Hyde Park (wish I had my bike there), we walked to two plays. Discount shopping about a 10 minute walk north (mile long set of shops). Fell in love with a pub two blocks away (Lion something) - take a left out of the hotel and you run into it. Pub meals are excellent - and great piano player on Saturday night. Less than 10 minute walk to the tube - and sightseeing bus stop. I cannot even begin to explain how this hotel's location is right in the thick of things. It is about 3 blocks from Princess Di's Hairdresser - Nickie Clark. Careful - the gym that is included in the hotel (a block away) is closed on weekends. We really cannot wait to go back - hope they don't raise the prices too much with all this great feedback I've read on this site. Have FUN!!!

<Content>A Little Gem! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night in January and were not disappointed. The hotel is in an excellent location within Mayfair, about a 10 minute walk from Green Park Tube Station.The staff were attentive but not obtrusive. A mere 5 minutes after getting up to our room did we receive a call from the receptionist checking that we were satisfied with our accommodation. The standard double room was small but spotlessly clean with every amenity you would need.We did not dine in the restaurant that evening but did enjoy a wonderful English breakfast on the Sunday morning. A cold buffet offered an excellent selection of juices, cereals, cooked meats, cheeses, pastries etc. Hot breakfasts were cooked to order, with a great choice and very tasty!A minor moan is that drinks in the bar are quite expensive with a gin and tonic and a pint of coke costing 拢12.50! We will however definitely be staying at this hotel again and would highly recommend it.

<Content>Helpful staff and warm atmosphere My daughter and I stayed just one night at The Chesterfield and took advantage of the promotion found on the hotel's website that included a full breakfast. The hotel was warm, clean, safe and very British. Breakfast was a huge cold buffet as well as hot offerings from the kitchen; a real treat. Though not the least expensive room in the city, for about $200, it was, for two of us, worth every penny. Plus we got to leave our bags there the next day while we were out exploring.

<Content>Cozy Little Joint Frankly not much to add to what has already been said. Met up with a good friend in London and decided to stay here. It is a very nice property in a upscale part of London, but aside from the attentiveness of the staff (which isn't a bad thing) there was NO snobbiness. In spite of our being there on a drinking weekend we got no sideways glances or the like. Mind you we weren't in the room with chainsaws or anything, just a few jars of ale is all.My only even remotely negative comment is that the hotel is a bit further from theatres, main sites etc. But if you want to be close to Green Park and Hyde Park (morning walk or run - lovely) it is ideal. Best of all - the hotel is a tremendous value compared to others of its ilk. Go Chesterfield!

<Content>The best hotel I have ever stayed in. My wife and I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for two nights in January. The hotel is wonderfully located for the West End, for shopping and for the major tourist attractions. It can all be done on foot if you are of average fitness. You see so much more on foot. From the moment the door was opened for us to the moment we left, the experience was delightful.We had a standard room and although not huge, it was beautifully decorated and appointed.We were not able to experience the delights of the dining room as dining for both nights had been pre-arranged but we will certainly try it next time.The breakfast was excellent with the full English being prepared to order.However, the thing which places this hotel at the top of my list is the staff. Every member of staff was friendly and highly efficient. Nothing was too much trouble and the attention to detail was exceptional.The only slight niggle was the prices in the bar with two gin and tonics costing 拢15.50.If you are not sure where to stay in London, try the Chesterfield. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>As close as possible to perfect ! We stayed at the Chesterfield for a long weekend in mid-December, 2005. The Chesterfield was a fantastic choice. It is located very close to public transportation, which made getting around very easy. Of course, it is within walking distance of many great cafes, pubs, restaurants, shops, and even one of the cities big, beautiful parks ( the name escapes me --- it's the one siutated next to the Ritz ). The food was terrific, and the room, albeit not as large as standard North American hotel rooms, was spotless and beautifully appointed, with lots of storage space. The bathroom lacked nothing. Above all else, the service stands out as truly exceptional. From front desk staff, to restaurant staff, as well as the porters, housekeepers, and room service attendants --- everybody was extremely warm and friendly, and eager to help. To sum up ... for the reasonable price, location, ammenities, and service, one cannot go wrong with the Chesterfield Mayfair. We'll be back.

<Content>Loved this hotel! Just returned from London where we spent 5 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair. I selected the hotel based on Trip Advisor's reviews and was not disappointed. The January Winter Rate room special was a great deal (110 pounds a night including a full breakfast). The rooms were small but very functional including all the american amenities like a hairdryer and ironing board. The staff was efficient, friendly and very helpful. I cannot say enough about how great our stay was. I encourage others to check them out!

<Content>Loved the Chesterfield If you're looking for a central London hotel which offers solitude, first class service  fine food in luxurious surrounding, all at a price which won't combust your credit card, then look no further than The Chesterfield.With attentive staff at all levels it would be difficult to find a better hotel within this 4 star band. A veritable oasis of tranquility and luxury right in the heart of Mayfair. Walk 100 metres to Berkeley Square and, at the right time of night and if you have an active enough imagination, you may even hear that famous nightingale sing!Highly recommended by this sixty- something year old traveller  his wife.

<Content>Lovely hotel in sophisticated Mayfair So often I meant to write about the truly exceptional Chesterfield Mayfair. Last August, I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for three nights. As a young woman traveling alone to London on holiday, the Chesterfield made me feel completely valued and safe, the staff always courteous and helpful. The location was simply splendid: in the heart of Mayfair, nestled amid the wealthy townhouses and flats on Charles Street. It was splendid to walk around this neighborhood, sip coffee in Berkeley Square, visit the many posh hotels, stroll up and down Park Lane, and converse with the locals at the Red Lion pub--just up the road from the hotel. And for me, it was terribly exciting as I was walking back in the evening to see an exclusive party just next door at a private residence--then to step into the hotel to overhear a wedding reception in the pavillion. I highly recommend the Chesterfield Mayfair to those who appreciate the finer things in life, and hotels.

<Content>The pinnacle of service As part of a European business trip for my employer the week of 14 November 2005, I had the good fortune to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel at 35 Charles Street in London. There are many adjectives I could use to try and convey the regal service, the smart accommodations, the excellent food and the knowledgeable and courteous staff - but suffice to say it can be summed up in the word pinnacle. Everything about my stay - from the confirmation of my hotel room weeks prior to my arrival, to the moment I departed for the airport to continue my business trip - was without question the best hotel experience I have ever had - and I have had many in my day, thanks in large part to the travel demands placed upon me by my current and former employer.Please allow me to give just three examples of how my expectations were exceeded. Firstly, on the day of my arrival, I was late in checking in due to a flight delay. Not only was the room held for me, but the busboy took the time to explain all of the features of my comfortable room and made sure that I understood everything to his satisfaction. Secondly, that evening, I had arranged to have dinner at the home of a business associate and I didn't want to come empty-handed. The hotel restaurant manager showed me two excellent wines to consider. Needless to say, my hosts were impressed with the high quality of the wine I brought to their home. In fact they could not say enough about it, so impressed they were with the bouquet and how well it complemented the evening meal.Finally, I was having dinner at the hotel restaurant one evening and was unsure of what kind of steak I should have. The head waiter suggested a particular filet that I had never tried before. When I cut into the tender meat and tasted it for the first time, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. This was truly the best cut of beef I have ever had.As for the room itself, it is cozy and quiet and yet very functional, facilitating one's relaxation after a long day at the office. I closing, I can't say enough about the excellent service of the staff. Every one of them was so gracious and accommodating - quite refreshing in today's politically correct world. I commend the hotel management and staff for an excellent experience, and I recommend it without any reservations whatsoever.

<Content>A Good Choice In Central London One has to start off with the understanding that when it comes to hotel accommodations, you get far less for your money in London than in most major cities around the world. At least that has been our experience over the past 25 years and after more than 20 visits. Having said that, we chose to stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair primarily because of its location. My wife and I stayed at the hotel from November 16th - 19th, 2005 and booked a Superior King room. At the time of our booking, we were provided a complimentary afternoon tea and a complimentary breakfast for each day of our stay. As we found out, these were truly nice benefits as breakfast was about $30 per person per day and the tea with sandwiches, etc. was about $15 per person per day. Upon check-in we were also rewarded with a complimentary upgrade to the Garden Suite...a welcomed surprise! The hotel is small and well located on a side street (Charles) in Mayfair. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are very traditionally British decorated. We were happy that we received an upgrade because the suite was an average sized room with a king size bed and a spacious bathroom. Room decoration was average as well. By London standards the room may be considered a suite, but it would have been considered a regular room in most other cities. Nevertheless, it was adequate for the two of us and we were satisfied with the accommodations.Food. Breakfast at the hotel was very good with a nice selection of items to choose from. I personally thought that 18 pounds was way too much for the breakfast, but since it was included with our room we did not have to worry about it. The afternoon tea with small sandwiches, cakes and biscuits was also nice. We did have dinner one night at the main restaurant and found the food to be satisfactory...nothing special, but fine for the price.Service. The service at the hotel was very good and everyone was very hospitable and eager to help. A very friendly staff overall. Location. Excellent. We love the Mayfair area and this was one of the main reasons we chose the Chesterfield Mayfair over others in the Red Carnation chain. It is located on a quite street with little traffic noise to spoil your stay. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Mayfair and is very close to Piccadilly, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, and most of the centrally located attractions. The Green Park underground station is about a 5 to 10 minute walk away. Cost. Our Superior King room was $300 per night, but as mentioned we were upgraded to the Garden Suite. We felt that with the inclusion of breakfast and afternoon tea, the price was very good for all we received.

<Content>Applause all round. Visited London, to see a show. Using Trip Advisor, I chose the Chesterfield Mayfair, for its location and atmosphere. The hotel did not disappoint. If anything, it had the air of a grand private home rather than a gentleman's club. It is situated conveniently for shopping in Mayfair and fifteen minutes pleasant walk to the West End theatres. The staff were welcoming and attentive, without being obsequious or intrusive. My room was extremely comfortable and the bathroom spacious. The shower was not a tepid dribble but especially pleasant and refreshing. Breakfast was delightful, with a wide choice, to suit virtually every taste.Needless to say, the Chesterfield Mayfair will be my choice in the future.

<Content>Outstanding service - can't wait to return I am quite fussy when it comes to Hotel Cleanliness. This hotel could not have been cleaner - it was absolutely spotless; evry surface was gleaming in the bathroom. The decor was quite attractive. The room was a decent smallish size, however two well equiped closets and plenty of drawer space made the room seem spacious, with plenty of room to hang clothes and store luggage. As for the service, the staff is top notch - polite as can be, and truly concerned with our well-being, from supplying extra towels, to cautioning us that we should take the in-house umbrellas because there was a good chance of rain. The location was ideal and quiet, but the outstanding level of service was something I will not forget -- the most expensive hotels in the States could learn a thing or two about service from this hotel. I hope to be able to stay again someday.

<Content>Service With A Smile October 22-24, had a great time in London. I've stayed in much larger rooms and had much bigger bathrooms, however, the great staff makes the difference nominal. They bend over backwards to make you happy. If you stay at the Chesterfield, ask for Chris, he was wonderful.

<Content>Location and value - the best choice in heart of London I am a business traveler and I must say I finally found a perfect London hotel with great location - in the most convenient Mayfair area, near the Green Park. It is a brisk 5 minutes walk to the tube station, and close to the popular shopping, businesses, theatres, museums and restaurants. And great value - I booked a business traveler's room online inclusive of the full English breakfast, the selection was plentiful and sumptious(for only 10 sterlings extra). The room is in fine condition; it is well appointed and tastefully done, high speed internet connection, basic office supplies in the drawer, and comfortable beddings. The public areas are beautifully decorated and maintained. I found the hotel staff are very attentive, courteous and helpful. You have to pay a whole lot more to stay in hotels in London with similar location and quality. I would certainly recommend it to both business travelers as well as leisure travelers.

<Content>Unbelievable Customer Service Just returned from London where we spent 6 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair in London. This hotel in part of a group called Red Carnation Hotels. The room was beautiful. The service was incredible. The food outstanding. We have stayed in very nice hotels all over the world...but I have never experienced service like this. All of the staff treat you like you are the only guests in the hotel.I would be very surprised to ever read a bad review of this hotel.

<Content>Wonderful weekend Just returned from a great weekend at the Chesterfield Mayfair, it was our anniversary and I had high hopes for this hotel based upon the reviews on this site. I have to say that it met and exceeded all of my expectations. From the staff, to the rooms, the restaurant and bar everything was first class and contributed to a wonderful weekend all round. The staff were very friendly and no request was too much trouble. The hotel was in a great location and I wished I had not paid for my undergrounds tickets in advance as we were able to walk to just about everywhere we needed to go. We will definately return.

<Content>Comfortable and Classy We stayed for several nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair,which is located in a charming and convenient section of London. The staff was helpful but not intrusive, the beds were comfortable, bathrooms pristine and well-functioning. The luxuriously decorated rooms were a bit small, and might begin to feel cramped after an extended stay, or if one needed to spend a fair amount of time in the room, but this should not be an issue for the average tourist; it was not an issue for us. The public areas were also very upscale. Ask for special offers when making a reservation; there may be discounts or packages available.

<Content>First Rate Experience We have just returned from our trip to London, and are very pleased to have chosen the Chesterfield. We arrived on foot with our bags and were immediatley greeted and our bags taken from us. The reception staff were excellent and the porters / concierge couldn't be more helpful and friendly. We had booked a standard double room @ 拢139 but the room allocated was at the back of the hotel, overlooking the air conditioning units etc. and it was on the small size so I asked reception if they had anything larger. We were shown two options - a king size and a mini suite - we chose the mini suite and negotiated a supplement of 拢45 which worked out to a very good rate - and they included breakfast as token gesture. This was all dealt with in a very professional manner. The bar has a 'gentlemans club' feel about it and there is a pianist in the evenings - again service from the bar staff is very good and prices reasonable considering it is a Mayfair location. There is a wide choice at breakfast although @ 拢18 this is marked up considerably. The overall experience was superb and we only wish our stay was longer.

<Content>Look forward to staying again. We stayed Aug 13-17 and had a wonderful experience. The hotel's location could not have been better, if you are a walker you can get most everywhere on foot. The out of the way places can be got to by tube nearby. The service was unusually warm and helpful, very genuine and friendly. After the shock of seeing our incredibly tiny room we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the bathroom. The air conditioned room came in handy and we got used to the size, we were hardly there anyway. Freshly stocked with plenty of towels daily and nice amenities. Beware, there is a wedding or party hall right next door to the hotel and the loud music can last until the wee hours. Ask for a room at the front of the hotel, or on the side where the side street is, it might be quieter. We came to really love our end of the day nightcap ritual at the cozy bar in the lobby, more excellent service to be had here.

<Content>superb service I have just returned from an excellent two nights at The Chesterfield. The hotel is located on a quiet street near Berekely Square. It took us 8 minutes to walk there from Green Park tube station.My wife and I were thrilled with the hospitality and cordial atmosphere. The check-in was super quick and the concierge extremely friendly and helpful.Our room was wonderful and the walls appeared to be covered in a soft duvet like material that we presumed enhanced the sound insulation. There was an abundance of toiletries and fresh towels along with his and hers luxury bathrobes. During both nights we could not hear anyone else. It was though we were the only ones staying at the hotel! The room had internet connection. The bathroom had underfloor heating and the electronic A/C was surprisingly quiet. The service at Breakfast was fast and faultless and never rushed , even on the weekend mornings the restaurant was calm with plenty of spaces for last minute arrivals. . The buffet breakfast was varied and fresh and the fry ups remarkably light. All in all I wont be trekking through endless reviews for London hotels anymore. When in London, its got to be the Chesterfield.

<Content>Great hotel We just got back from holiday in London at the Chesterfield Mayfair. A wonderful hotel. It is about three or four blocks from the Green Park tube station. There is internet service at the hotel; however, thinking it was probably too costly, we opted for the Fed Ex/Kinkos store around the corner which is open 24/7 and has several computers. Berkeley Square, a nice small green park, is about one block away. Many nice restaurants and little caf茅s within a two-three block radius. One of the major tour bus operators (The Big Bus or something like that) is right across the street from the tube. Perfect location.Hotel room was perfect with fresh towels constantly and big, thick robes. Never heard any of the other patrons.Would stay there again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Mixed Review for the Chesterfield I'm afraid that the reviews on this site might have unrealistically raised my expectations. I stayed for five nights and had a decidedly mixed experience:Location: Nice, fairly central to many things. Not immediately near the underground.Accomodations: The first room they gave me was very tiny, right next to the elevator and the only view was of the cooling system. When I asked to move, they were kind enough to upgrade me to a much larger theme room on a higher floor, toward the back of the hotel.The room itself was clean, but a bit worn (carpet, bedding, upholstery). My floorboards creaked terribly, and in turn, I could hear (loudly) every footstep in the room above me. Service: Most of the staff was remarkably friendly, efficient and warm. The concierge who was there for the beginning of my stay was very patient and informative. However, the concierge who was there for the remainder of my stay gave the distinct impression that he would prefer to be left alone and responded to questions with only cursory answers.Restaurant: The food was fairly average and breakfast is quite expensive, but the service was very good.

<Content>Wonderful! We stayed at the Chesterfield for 6 nights in July with 2 children, 2 adults and 2 grandparents. Everyone loved it. The staff was so friendly. They bent over backwards to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. The rooms are somewhat small compared to American hotels but very average for a European hotel. The breakfast is delicious and offers something for everyone. It's location is within walking distance of the Greenpark tube stop and Buckingham Palace. We would stay here every time!

<Content>Good Value Excellent value for money. We booked a single room for a relative for 拢99 through a website and later upgraded it to a double for us as our relative cancelled. The first time we phoned we were quoted 拢50 to upgrade to a double but I called back an hour later, spoke to someone else who offered the upgrade for 拢20. Hotel bill was incorrect and they overcharged us by 拢200. However, this was a genuine mistake we think and we thought the hotel was actually very good with the rooms furnished to a very high standard. Recommended

<Content>The best we have stayed in. My husband and I stayed in the Chesterfield Mayfair for the second time in August, nothing is too much bother, the suite was first class and it is within walking distance for the theatres, Buckingham Palace and lots of other tourist spots. The staff are friendly and helpful. We ate in the restaurant which was very good. We would not stay anywhere else but here.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel The Chesterfield Mayfair is a gem of a hotel in a city of bad hotels. The rooms are tastefully furnished and the staff couldn't be more helpful if they tried (and try they will!). It is London so the rooms are not big but they are spotlessly clean and the marble bathrooms are stunning. Breakfast is amazing but make sure that it is included in your room price as it is very pricey (拢18.50) otherwise.Being only a 15 minute walk from Picadilly Circus, the hotel is perfectly located for getting to the West End and very handy for shopping trips as well.I found that by phoning the hotel direct I could get a better rate than any web site could offer and they threw in breakfast as well.

<Content>Delightful Experience Altogether My daughters and I stayed at the Chesterfield in late July for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. As others have noted, the location is wonderful and all the staff consistently courteous and helpful. We ate in the restaurant twice - it was certainly the best hotel food I've had in London, with excellent service. The girls' twin room was pleasant, if just a tad 'cosy' for 2 people, while my double room was extremely comfortable, spacious and well-appointed, with a large bathrooom; both rooms were cleaned meticulously and turned down each evening. We got an online rate of 拢117.75 plus VAT per room (not including breakfast) which I felt wasn't too expensive, given the superb location and great service. All in all it was a delightful stay and I would not hesitate to stay there again or to recommend it to others.

<Content>wonderful hotel We loved our stay at the chesterfield in late July 2005. Thoughtful concierge helped plan a theater trip , including dinner. rooms were decent sized and nicely equipped. Lovely breakfast with nice staff (included in our rate). good location a few blocks from tube and buses.the street itslef was quiet, but there were restaurants nearby in Shepherd market (many of them open sunday night, which we did not find in other nearby neighborhoods).We would stay there again in a moment.

<Content>Chesterfield Mayfair - Outstanding Choice Fm shopping around, London Chesterfield Mayfair was best value, so we booked and held our breath. They exceeded expectations on everything (note - we knew going in that rooms would be relatively small and London food cost would be outrageous). Outstanding visit. Stayed for entire week with wife and a 21 and 18 year old. Two rooms. Can't emphasize enough how important location was. Could easily get to most anything. Staff was consistently courteous, helpful and responsive. July terrorist incidents became a distant memory. Will definitely stay here again upon return to London.

<Content>No request is too small, no detail overlooked We stayed at the chesterfield based on the reviews from this site. Its not the cheapest place to stay in, but is by far the best hotel i've stayed in. The room was superb,quiet,well furnished (Queen sized bed, desk, comfy chairs) and a nice size for London. Bathroom had good water pressure, and the hotel provides superb bathrobes. The location of the hotel is superb, with Picadilly Circus only a 15 minute walk away. But the main reason to stay is the service. I've stayed in good hotels before, but the service at the Chesterfield beats all. From the moment you walk in your treated as an individual, and not just a customer. The staff are gracious, extremely helpfull and always there to help you. The bellhops even remember your name! I would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>GREAT HOTEL Stayed at the Chesterfield Hotel during August, for 5 nights. The hotel was very clean and a good sized room. Great location, near to most shops and attractions. A very quiet location, could not hear anything during night time, which is great for being in london! Staff were pleasant too. The only thing i would change was the size of the bathroom - very small! However, it had everything you would need and a nice sized bath. The only other thing was that the pillows were feathers (just my personal preference that i don't like them) and that the TV played up a couple of times. However, this would not put me off staying at this great hotel, we will certainly go back to this hotel. Great hotel!!!

<Content>A Gem of a Hotel! My daughter and I stayed for 5 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair. All in all, we had a fantastic experience. The hotel is charming, clean, comfortable and in an excellent location. Best of all is the staff that work there. Everyone was not only so nice but also very helpful in any way he or she could be. I would not think twice about staying any where else when I return to London.

<Content>Fabulous! I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for five nights. Their website says they pay attention to detail, and they are not kidding!The room was one of the most beautiful I have ever stayed in. Truly luxurious. Plenty of space, large comfy bed, immaculate cleaning, new or at least very well maintained furnishings, linens, three phones, huge closets, lovely decor. I was there during the heatwave, and the A/C worked perfectly.I ate in the restaurant four different times, the service was excellent, and the food delicious.Lovely piano bar, with great drinks, and friendly service.The location of the hotel is about as central as you can get.I have nothing at all that I can complain about, and I will be back on my next trip to London. This hotel is about as close to the Ritz or the Dorchester as you can get without actually staying at those hotels!Yes, it is expensive but you get what you pay for.

<Content>Great Hotel. Great Location, Great Staff Our family of four stayed five nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair and we were very satisfied with our experience. The hotel is situated in a perfect location for sightseeing. Very close to Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly. Mayfair is a charming area of London with many great restaurants and pubs within close proximity to this hotel. We were able to take long walks in the early evening and felt perfectly safe. The staff was particularly attentive and eager to offer assistance with restaurant recommendations and other tips. It is expensive, (particularly since we occupied two rooms) but compared to other London hotels I felt that it offered strong value. The restaurants and bar are pricey, but there are many additional dining options available very close by and the staff is eager to steer you in the right direction.

<Content>Great Hotel, excellent location I had the pleasure of staying the one night at the Chesterfield and wished it had been longer.Check in was easy and within 10 minutes of being in the room the receptionist rung to ask if all was well with the room. The room was larger than I expected for a single with a large lit wardrobe. The shower room was roomy with plenty of space for all girlie items.The area around is full of cafes, bars resturants incuding a Tesco, Express and Sainsburys central all within 5 minutes walk of the Hotel.The bar was intimate and had a lovely piano player, the drinks a little expensive but this is central London and having said that the drink came with a plate of crudites, dip, queen olives and mixed nuts, enough that I could not contemplate dinner!! The lass serving was courteous, chatty and initiated a move from some cigar smokers to another part of the bar.On return to the room the bed had been turned back, blind pulled down, tv turned towards the bed, the remote control, tv programme mag and room service menu had been left on the bed with a couple of pieces of fudge.I did not sample breakfast so cannot comment on the food.No problem with checkout.All in all a very good experience and one I hope will enjoy again on my next trip to London

<Content>A Hotel with Character The Chesterfield has a wonderful location in London; near the shoppes, excellent restaurants, public transport.The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms bright and full of character. We stayed in a theme suite called the 'Music Room'; a room unlike any you have ever stayed in before. But that is the Chesterfield! July was terribly hot in London and we were happy to find excellet air conditioning.The bar was delightful with an excellent pianist playing favourites long into the night.The location of Mayfair is one of the best in London, clean and safe.An excellent bet when when staying in London. We would definitely go back to the Chestefield!

<Content>Not worth the price ! Booked two deluxe double rooms for the 23rd  24th July. Both rooms were on the 3rd floor  were of the same design throughout - very masculine 'chav' type fabric wall covering with matching bedding. Bedrooms were OK size wise but bathrooms had over-bath showers  were very tiny. I used LondonTown (who were very helpful) when searching for luxury accomodation in London  was offered a 'special' price of 拢134 (excl. VAT) per night, per room - which was probably a fair price for this type of accomodation in Mayfair but I don't think they should charge more. Sadly this price did not include breakfast. If you do decide on this hotel  your booking does not include breakfast, I would suggest that you go down at about 7.30am  stay until they shut  make the most of your very lovely but expensive (拢18.50) english breakfast. Bar is vastly overprised - 1 measure of Baileys cost over 拢6 !!! On the whole it was very nice, very clean but there are better hotels in London.

<Content>Loved the Chesterfield I had the good fortune to stay At the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in February with my daughter. The rooms were a nice size and very well maintained. It was convenient to have a restaurant located in the hotel and the food and service were excellant. The staff were very accomodating, making dinner reservations, giving directions and booking tours, always in a very pleasant manner. The location in Mayfair was great, we were close to the tube when we chose not to walk. If I have the opportunity to return to London I would definetly stay there again.

<Content>perfectly situated for a relaxing city break We booked a theatre break over the internet and chose this hotel for its position,within walking distance of the theatre,close to the many sights of London,and not far from Victoria station;as we had flown down from Manchester and took the Gatwick express train.We stayed for two nights.On arrival,we were immediately impressed with the attractive hotel lobby and the enthusiastic reception of the staff ,and discovered that we'd got a complimentary upgrade to one of their burberry king rooms, which whilst being fairly small was beautifully decorated with a very comfortable bed and pleasant marble bathroom with fluffy bathrobes/towels.The hotel was on a very quiet corner of Mayfair but within a couple of streets you joined the hustle and bustle of the city;so you could return to your quiet oasis after a hectic day doing the tourist trail!We only took breakfast in the hotel which was very good,lots of choice and lots of fresh fruit which we love;so we are unable to comment on any other meals,however the menu looked varied and reasonably priced.We like to experience the local restaurants and would recommend the small Italian bistro,around the corner from the hotel, just down from the Tesco express.We really enjoyed our stay at the Chesterfield and would certainly stay here again,and recommend to family and friends.You always get the occassional niggle wherever you stay and really most aren't worth mentioning so we won't.Any break away is what you make it, so for the people who have made negative comments about this hotel, you must be very hard to please,I suggest you stay at home!

<Content>London accommodations at its best This beautiful and well maintained hotel has comfortable rooms, impeccable public areas, and even gives you a choice of complimentary red or green apples in large silver bowls in the lobby! There is also a decanter of sherry for guests use also in the lobby. The hotel is situated on a quiet street in beautiful Mayfair. When you are in your room, there is no sense that you are in a bustling and crowded city. Our room was located facing a beautiful quiet Georgian courtyard. Small restaurants are nearby in Shepherd's Market. Weekend rates were found on internet sources linked to this site.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel After much research we picked this hotel because of consistently high reviews from multiple sources--we were not disappointed. The rooms were a good size and very well appointed with beautiful marble bathrooms. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The location is great--just a 5 minute walk from the Green Park tube, central to attractions and shopping, and there are 25 pubs and restaurants within a 2 minute walk. I would recommend a room away from the street, as street noise can be a problem, just as in most city hotels. It is well priced and an excellent value. It will be our first choice for a return stay.

<Content>traditional english hotel My husband and I recently returned from our third trip to london having had a fabulous time. We stayed a the Chesterfield Mayfair, a lovely small (100 rooms) very english style hotel. It is ideally located within walking distance to many of the most popular tourist attraction and SHOPPING. The public rooms are very comfortable and homey, like staying at the home of a good friend. The rooms are small by american standards but the space is very well utilized and the beds are VERY comfortable. The bathrooms likewise are small and the tub/shower we found a little difficult (a high step up into shower which was tight) but they do offer theme, junior and executive suites which we are seriously considering for our next trip. We had dinner in the restaurant twice and room service for breakfast each day and both were delicious. The staff are very attentive without being intrusive and I truely felt like the queen of england in a very short period of time. All in all we had a lovely time, with the Chesterfield our home base exploring a truely wonderful city. Marge P.

<Content>A London Gem June 2005.Reviewer: Martin from Isle of ManI have stayed at the Chesterfield in Mayfair London on previous occasions for business and have always found it first rate both in terms of service and location. My wife and I recently spent a long weekend in London mainly for the Chelsea flower show. Everything about the hotel was first rate from arrival to departure. Service was way above to what one tends to find as the norm for central city hotels. The location so close (walking distance) to Buckingham Palace and Green Park Tube station makes it a very central point for easy access anywhere. Harrods/Piccadily  Oxford Circus/Trafalgar Square all just one or two stops away. We would certainly return at any time and will happily be able to pursuade friends and family to stay there.

<Content>Treated Like Royalty The Chesterfield is synonymous with excellent service and royal elegance. My girlfriend and I stayed here during the May bank holiday weekend. We took the advice from previous travelers and opted for one of their suites. The room was charming and spacious. During our stay we ate dinner in the restaurant, but would probably venture out on a future return to London. The staff at the Chesterfield were very courteous, catering to our every need. The hotel is located just a few steps off of the beaten path, which we welcomed. Car traffic and pedestrian noise was negligible. The hotel is located near many luxury shops, but you wouldn't know it unless you decided to stroll on the many side streets in Mayfair. If you're looking to experience London at its best, make the Chesterfield your home away from home.

<Content>My favorite hotel in the world! I love the Chesterfield. I can't wait to return. The rooms are beautiful and luxurious, the service is impeccable, and the decor is just beautiful. We stayed in a king superior room. It was very very lovely, only thing is if you stay in the king rooms they are more designed for business travellers. I would stay in a double or if you can afford it, the themed junior suites. I had the privilege of seeing the Music Room suite which is absolutely intoxicating. (Canopy bed, iron clawed jacuzzi tub, beautiful!) But the rooms are very nice with great beds, complimentary bottled water, bathrobes and slippers and big tubs in the bathrooms with Gilchrist and Soames soaps etc. Plus a newspaper of your choice is left outside your door in the mornings. Our rate was 拢147 including VAT and breakfast. Please note I got the rate by calling the hotel directly as the rates when you call are significantly cheaper than the rates on the website and the earlier you call the cheaper it is. The location of the Chesterfield can't be beat. It is around the corner from Hyde Park and Green Park and St. James Park. There is a little alcove of restaurants just around the bend on Curzon Street (including the absolutely delicious french bistro Le Boudin Blanc which I highly recommend). The nearest metro stop is Green Park on the Picadilly and Victoria line. The hotel concierge are lovely and everyone in the hotel will help you with anything you need. Their motto is no detail too small and they lived up to that. They will even drive you places in the hotel's Bentley (costs a bit but how glamorous!). We went to the hotel for a relaxing weekend and that's exactly what we got. Loved every minute of our stay at the Chesterfield. It was perfect.

<Content>Always a Warm welcoming at the Chesterfield As a frequesnt business traveller, a hotel often becomes just a bed for the night and no longer feels special. I have stayed at the Chesterfield in Mayfair 4 or 5 times now and it has not yet failed to impress. Every time there is another little suprise which just makes the stay worth while. No request is ever too much trouble and the service really is second to none.The staff are always pleased to see you and very welcoming. A good example of a typical experience at the Chesterfield is my last trip to London in May. It startarted with a delayed flight, a cancelled Victoria Express and then a mile long que for a cab, I arrived at the hotel in a foul mood at 1'o'clock in the morning! I was welcomed with sympathy and offered refreshments, while my bags were taken to my room. After a short wind down I went up to my room to discover that I had been upgraded to a superior suite and was able to take full advantage of the most fabulous bath I have ever had the pleasure of in London. So fed, watered and now bathed I went to bed and enjoyed a most superb nights sleep. With a full itinery the following day, I really needed it.I not only highly recommend the Chesterfield as a business traveller, its location for a holiday to London makes it ideal. You are close to the shops of Oxford Street, Knightsbridge and the Kings Road Chelsea. The sights of Buckingham Palace and Westminster are also a stones throw away. If the theatre is your thing then you are also close to all the major productions and as for galleries are concerned you are spoilt for choice with the larger commercial galleries like the Tate and the National as well as lots of smaller independents showing less commercial works! Perfect.

<Content>Great Little Hotel in Mayfair We stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair over the Bank Holiday weekend in early May, and had a delightful stay. The staff were very friendly and outgoing, but thoroughly professional. We had a bit of a problem with the rate, as their internet site said breakfast was included, but at check-in the staff said it wasn't. Make sure you print out your rate and what's included and bring it with you. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but are very nicely decorated, and quite sumptuous. The bathroom was wonderful, with marble tiled walls and a heated floor. The mirror had a nifty anti-fogging device which was very effective. The breakfast was superb.It's our favorite hotel in London, and have stayed there many times.

<Content>Nice small hotel Anyone staying in downtown London can find a nice place to stay at the Chersterfield Mayfair hotel. It's right down the street from Green Park and with in easy walking distance to the Ritz and other attractions. We found this place through a local recommendation, when our initial choices were sold out. The prices in London are a killer ($100 = 46 pounds) which the hotel came in at $350 USD but was cheaper than some of our other choices.

<Content>Beware the hype... I looked around for a hotel a week before staying in London. I usually use a 5* one at London Bridge, but wanted to be in the West End. I trusted all the reviews of the Chesterfield as they have paid off for me before. BUT it is not as good as people say. I paid 拢150 for a King size (negotiated from 拢187) - one of their very recently redecorated 'large' rooms. Well, I honestly couldn't swing a cat in it - the window was tiny and was next to the noisy air con vents. The walls were draped in Burberry cloth, which may have cost a lot, but we named it the Chav suite immediately! Anyway, the worst thing - the King size bed was 2 singles pushed together. So, I had us moved to a room with the biggest bed on offer - a queen size! The room was bigger and quieter, but I couldnt stand up under the shower - the ceilings are very low and then they cleverly put in a Victorian style vertical drop shower, which was lower than my shoulder! Staff were friendly and polite and the location is good. Apart from that - don't bother. I wont be going back. For the money you can get MUCH better than the Chesterfield.

<Content>Truly an outstanding experience We stayed at the Chesterfield Mafair from April 22-28. I can not say enough about this wonderful property. The experience was a true delight. The rooms were adequate, the bathroom perfect, the breakfast outstanding and the service absolutely perfect. The staff bent over backwards to make our stay as pleasant as possible, from serving us a room service breakfast at 5 AM one morning to booking dinner reservations, nothing was too much. It was the quietest hotel we ever stayed out--we felt we were the only ones there eventhough it was close to sold out. I would not ever consider staying anywhere else when I am in London again.

<Content>Not Mayfair, Maywonderful We stayed at Chesterfield Mayfair for our second visit during the third week of April, 2005. This is a professional and well run facility. From the quiet location in the middle of Mayfair, a block from Berkley Square, to the polite and helpful staff, to the nicely appointed rooms we can not imagine a better place to stay in London. Yes the rooms are small, and yes the shower could be improved, but there is nothing else that is negative to mention. Our stay included breakfast and the food was good and the choices excellent. If you are looking for a place to stay in London we strongly recommend the Chesterfield.

<Content>Thoroughly enjoyable stay Stayed for two nights in mid March and I really could not find any fault with the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. From the moment we arrived the staff were very polite, helpful and attentive. They genuinely seemed to care that we were happy with the hotel and the service provided.The room was nice, clean and big enough for the two of us. The bathroom was clean and comfortable and everything worked. The maid provides an early evening turn-down service (with little chocolates on the pillow) which I personally could do without but it is there if you like that kind of thing.We had dinner in the hotel on the Friday night and whilst the restaurant was very quiet we still enjoyed a wonderful dining experience. Again the staff were friendly and helpful but without being intrusive. The quality of the food and wine was first class. The breakfast the following morning was equally impressive.The location is also excellent. Hyde Park is within easy walking distance as are numerous pubs and cafes. There is a useful little Marks  Spencer at Green Park Tube station and there are some more lively pubs and wine bars on Park Lane. We are already planning our next stay at the hotel.

<Content>Charming and Clean Stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair 2/28-3/4 and was very pleased with the charm, cleanliness and friendly atmosphere created by the staff - particularly the front desk. We did have a little problem with the heat there but they were very accommodating and gave us the option to change rooms or use a space heater (which we choose and it was fine). Location is convenient with taxis always available in front if needed. Dinner was very good in the restaurant. We booked taxi fare from Heathrow to Chesterfield through hotel and it was quite pricey. We did better booking a taxi on our own on the return home. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic beds Stayed at the Chesterfield the week before Christmas. Was greeted by a lovely chap who came to the taxi to take the cases. Reception area very cosy, beautiful tree and lovely reception staff. We were taken to our room by a nice man who explained the times for afternoon tea, his accent was a little more than cut glass and we managed not to giggle until he had left our room to collect the cases. The room was beautiful, a little small but very comfortable. The bathroom is very clean and modern with super little toiletries, the real bonus of it is a heated floor in the night so you don't have to worry about putting on the sweet little slippers they provide. The dressing gowns were thick and snuggly and the bed a large king size I think. (fantastic pillows!)There are tea and coffee making facilities on a tray. We went out to dinner that evening and when we returned our bed had been turned down, the lights dimmed, a television guide placed on the bed at the correct date with the remote control and the television turned to face the bed. All of this plus the chocolates on the pillow were so inviting that we got into our lovely gowns, drank coffee and ate our choccy as though we were at home! So romantic. Our room overlooked a square so was very quiet too despite being a Saturday night.The position of the hotel is perfect, just a few minutes walk from the Fortnums and the Burlington Arcade and some great restaurants. The only thing that was a let down was the breakfast, whilst ample most dissappointing. The cooked breakfast was luke warm and the coffee stewed, but we had such a brilliant sleep nothing could have spoilt the day. I will definately be going there again this year

<Content>The Best I have stayed at. I have stayed at numerous hotels in London, many in the five star rating and the Chesterfield certainly lives up to them regarding comfort, facilities etc. But what really sets this hotel apart from the others is the quality of their service. This of course only relates to the effectiveness and commitment of the staff which is excellent. I will only be staying at this hotel in the future

The staff are extraordinarily helpfull and treat every request with a smile and seamless efficiency.The rooms are cosy and well furnished and the restaurant offers excellent food accompanied by the same efficient and friendly service.Definitely a hotel to be recommended!

<Content>Jewel in the London Crown Quite and genteel, snuggled away from the bustle yet within a few minutes walk of it if you need it, the Chesterfield in Mayfair provides a high quality service for those who don t mind spending a bit above average. The service was outstanding; the rooms, well decorated but small; for London, though, you couldn t expect much more in size without doubling the size of your purse. Being able to walk a couple of minutes to excellent restaurants and ten minutes to the theatre, and then return to the serenity of the Chesterfield, made our London weekend memorable.

<Content>Lved the great british feel to this hotel My son was going to college in London and we wanted an upscale British hotel to stay in while we visited. This fit our goals to a tee. Rooms were clean and well appointed. The bar with piano player made our evening after sight seeing seem very special. This hotel will remind you of a private club of which you would be proud to be a member. As my daughter will also be going to college in london we look forward to a return visit.

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous! Stayed in the Chesterfield at the weekend, from jan 13-16th. It was beyond my expectations. Met by friendly doormen, booked in by a very friendly young american gentleman who arranged for our luggage to be stored until the room was ready as we were early. Everything was beyond expectations. The only difference i would say is that a four star hotel in N.Ireland might have larger rooms with slightly better furnishings, however what we did have was perfectly fine. We were told on arrival we had been upgraded! Fantastic! free of charge!The room was immaculatly clean and tidy with pre packaged slippers and dressing gowns also provided. Room service was brilliantly fast and not too pricey. Drinks were a bit pricey tho, a pint of coke worked out at 拢6.60, however there is a tesco express within walking distance. What i would say is book online for this hotel the deals are much better! The breakfast was brilliant, a selection of buffet continential and a cooked english breakfast. WITH crispy bacon!! something i thought didnt exist in english hotels!! (well in my past experience it hasnt). We were most pleasantly surprised when we came in from our days sightseeing to find the bed was turned down, chocolates on the pillows and the telly page open with remote control all laid out for us. The ladies and gents who do the room servicing really do a brilliant job. ALL the staff were very friendly and couldnt do enough to make our stay perfect.The area was nice, not too noisy for central london. The only thing was that because our trip was mainly for sight seeing we felt a bit out of place in our jeans in the bar. It seemed to attract a rather smarter attire. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to any visitors. The area is great, full of little coffee bars, juice bars and restuarants. Close to Green Park tube and main bus routes. And just accross the park from Buck Palace! We couldnt have asked for more!

<Content>Couldn't be better My sister and I have just returned from a one night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair, to celebrate our mother's 80th birthday with a trip to see Mary Poppins and over nightstay in London. We arrived at the hotel to be given a triple room as booked on the net, however the double bed and camp bed was not quite what we had expected. We were then moved to a suite - had to pay more but it was worth it. TV in all rooms - Corner bath, power shower  even our own Christmas tree in the lounge.We asked for an early tea as we had to pick up our theatre tickets an hour before the show, the staff were very accomodating , we selected our meals whilst getting ready, so the food was ready promptly @ 5.30 . Food  service was excellent and to top it all a surprise birthday cake for my mum courtesy of the management. Breakfast was the best I have had in a long time, great selection, good quality and again very helpful efficient staff.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the extra little touches and attention to detail added so much to the trip, it was meant to be a memorable occasion for my mother and the Chesterfield certainly made it so. All the staff from the housemaids, to the concierge and restaurant managers were all very helpful. I will certainly go back there again and recommend it to my friends.

<Content>the way it ought to be! Spend Christmas weekend there in 2004 -- and we loved it. Every staff member we encountered -- from housekeeping to head concierge to front desk and maintenance was differential, courteous and treated us like guests indeed. The hotel itself is lovely. It is tucked in a sweet Mayfair neighbourhood, yet handy for shopping, tube, and parks. We felt lucky to be there. We had booked a special Magical London Christmas package -- which included several special items like a complementary tea service, a taxi to Trafalgar Square, free gift wrapping service, and the marketing folks must not have told the actual front line staff very much about it. We had a few awkward moments when we had to ask about the services or explain that they 鈥榳ere included鈥?with our package. The staff was on the ball when we explained this, but it felt as if they could have been better informed of procedure on the package. We have stayed in many hotels in London 鈥?both high-end and moderate and consider the Chesterfield Mayfair at the top. Overall 鈥?we really appreciated the special touches such as complementary a.m. newspaper, turn down service, full breakfast, robes and slippers, in a very beautifully kept hotel with attentive and considerate staff.

<Content>Stayed here several times, loved all but the last. The location is great. Shepards place behind the hotel is a wonderful square to find food and fun. The Red Lion just up the street to the left is a classic london pub with fun, easy people. The hotel, small but charming, is on it self, very nice. Breakfast is included and always fresh. I travel on business and always reserve a room for the night prior to my arrival so I can put my head down for a few hours prior to the work day after a long flight from Boston. I arrived as I always do around 8:30 AM to check in. I was told I did not reserve a room for the night and that I would have to wait until the afternoon. I showed them my reservation and they said that's not what we see, basically calling me a lier. When I asked for the manager she quickly found me a room. While I love the location, I've book other places for my past several trips. I would stay there again, but they gave me reason to explore.

<Content>Great hotel, great location. We stayed at the Chesterfield for three nights, Oct 2 to the 5th. It's a beautiful, traditional style, English hotel. We loved the guest rooms as well as the public rooms. We stopped at the bar for a nightcap each night because it's so comfortable. The service was also quite good. The concierges are very helpful and knowledgable. Top it all off with the location; we walked everywhere. We will stay there again and recommend it to others.

<Content>Great Hotel, HOME FROM HOME My partner  I only live about 25 miles from london but every now and again try and spend a weekend away from home to go see the sights and take in a show and get some time out from everyday things. We love staying at the Chesterfield and now we have found this lovely quaint hotel we would not stay anywhere else. We have stayed in a suite (over valentines weekend) and my partner arranged the seduction package for me. It included rose petals on the bed, champagne on ice and chocolate dipped strawberries and also a selection of lovely gifts all arranged nicely on the bed. The suite was great and did have a minibar, the bathroom had a TV/radio and a spa bath. When we have stayed since then we have had a deluxe double room, although they are very nice if it is a special occasion I will definatly book a suite again. We found the food in the piano bar to be very good but the breakfast was just ok. Breakfast is much better if you go down to the resturant in the morning and don't order it via room service. We found the front desk staff to be very friendly and helpful, the bellboys are great and my favorite member of staff has to be Chris, he is so helpful and friendly nothing is a problem and he makes you feel very special throughout your stay. The staff in the piano bar are not so special you feel as if they are doing you a favour whenever you order things and many times when you are waiting to be served they just vanish which can be a bit frustrating. This would not ever put me off staying at this fantastic hotel but I just think they need to relook at these staff members. This hotel is very relaxing, very english and in no way stuffy. We have stayed at the Four seasons in the past which my partner loved but I found it very informal and very stuffy so i'm very glad that we found the Chesterfield and am looking forward to my next stay in the very near future.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay My wife, friends and I stayed at the Chesterfield 9/7/04-9/11/04 and we found it to be the perfect place to stay....we occupied rooms 501 and 503...contrary to what others have said, the rooms were not small at all....not large, but very adequate for UK/European standards....the baths were luxurious, the beds, comfortable and all amenities were provided...from coffee makers to iron and ironing board to turndown service....the reception staff couldn't have been more helpful....from Chris to Darren, Ian to Simon, they were all incredibly polite and accomodating....I wish I could say the same about the restaurant staff...aside from the host, most made you feel like they were doing YOU a favor......either way, a fantastic experience which we will, without hesitation partake in again.....when the dollar is just a little bit stronger!!!

<Content>Really great ! I stayed at the Chesterfield for three nights with my daughter at the end of july (from the 29th till the 1st of august). It was absolutely beautifull! The rooms are not very big but really quite sufficient for two and very nicely furnished, very cosy and British ! The bathroom is lovely: bathrobes (ver big!), plentyof towels, beauty products, a red carnation changed every day, everything you need. As it was quite hot, we were very pleased to have the air conditioning. Lovely carpet in the room, it was so good to walk barefoot on it after a long day shopping in the heat. The staff was ever so polite, obliging from the first minute we got there. We had the english breakfast which was plentiful, plus fresh fruits, all kinds of cereals...Afternoon tea was as good as in Harrod's ! In short, we had a wonderful stay and we will be back next time we go to London.

<Content>Excellent hotel. My husband and I stayed at The Chesterfield hotel from 1st to 4th July. I must say we found the hotel very nice and the staff very helpful. We had the full English breakfast included in the rate (140拢 taxes included) for a standard room. The breakfast is abolutely full, you can eat lots of food and directly jump to the dinner. The room has nice furniture and fit for two (not too big, but quite enough for us). We missed the mini bar even if we had one bottle of water free, it was at the room temperature.We tried the tea in the afternoon. Expensive (20拢), but can be compared to a meal and is very good.The location of the hotel is the best I can image: close to all the most important monuments, parks and the shopping area.Next time I'll choose it again.

<Content>would not stay here again I travel quite frequently to London from the U.S. on business and spent several nights at the Chesterfield recently. The noise until midnight was unbearably uncourteous of both the hotel and those adjacent to the hotel. I would not stay here again.

<Content>Great Find! We had a three night stay at the Chesterfield and loved every minute of it. The staff were friendly and helpful, the location was great (just up the street is a great restaurant, Benares, that serves Indian cuisine---do not miss a chance to have dinner here!) It is close to the Green Park tube station, and in close walking distance to many great areas of interest. Even though we were there on a weekend and had two nights of wedding parties, the noise did stop at midnight as promised (the party terrace we were told, is NOT owned by the hotel). The rooms were clean and very comfortable, with all sorts of nice amenities. We booked this hotel on the internet and got a very good rate. We will certainly choose to stay here again.

<Content>Kind and Helpful Staff My friend and I stayed at this hotel on the 27th, 28th and 29th of December 2003. The rooms are London small but nicely decorated. The restaurant was overpriced, but the 5 minute walk to Shepherds Market with two fantastic pubs with great authentic English food, the King's Arms and The Shepherds Inn made dining inexpensive. The front desk staff were kind and very helpful. They patiently answered every question and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. The hotel is right off Berkely Square and about a 15 minute walk to either the Green Park or Marble Arch tube stations. It is about a half hour walk to Picadilly Square. The location can't be beat.

<Content>A Little Slice of Heaven My husband and I stayed at The Chesterfield Mayfair for six nights, from 5-27-04 through 6-1-04. It was our 1st trip to London. We arrived a few days ahead of our 60th Anniversay of D-Day tour group, tired and grouchy after a nearly 11 hour white-knuckler flight. We were pleased by the quiet location of the hotel, compared to the very busy traffic just a few blocks away. The doorman greeted us warmly, and the front-desk staff was cordial. Half-way through the check-in procedure, we were alarmed to learn that the driver who had brought us from the airport, had driven off with one of our bags...the one with our plane tickets, itenerary,  ALL contact info, including the name of the limo company that picked us up!! The concierge (Darrin I believe) was EXTREMELY helpful during our frustrating attempt to locate the limo company and eventually retrieve our missing bag. Throughout our stay, we were greeted by name by hotel staff. We enjoyed our nightly chats with Umberto, the bartender. And although the rooms are very small by US standards, they were clean, and beautifully appointed. The bathroom, though tiny, was gorgeous! We came to really appreciate this later, after experiencing a not-so-nice hotel after leaving The Chesterfield.Our experience with the food wasn't that great. We don't eat runny scrambled eggs and undercooked bacon (which isn't anything like the bacon we know)...be sure to ask for your eggs and bacon well-cooked!!! We did have lamb (a new experience for me) which was actually good. We found ourselves drawn most mornings to a nearby American bagel place, just across from the Starbucks, which is adjacent to Berkley Square. We avoided starvation by eating twice at the Hard Rock cafe (great nachos!), and by stocking up on snacks, soda, and water at the Sainburys grocery store. Both are an easy 10 minute walk from the hotel, as is the tube stop next to the Ritz, and the pick-up location for the Big Bus tour. (Note: the Ritz is on a busy, noisy street...unlike the charming quaint street that The Chesterfield is located on). The only critique we have is that a small refrigerator in the room, and access to an ice machine, would have been welcome. We had medication that needed to be kept cold, and having to call the front desk every morning to ask for our medication, got to be annoying. The staff was gracious concerning this, but we would have preferred to handle this on our own. All in all, our stay at The Chesterfield was memorable. We hope to return to London again some day, and we would definately stay the The Chesterfield Mayfair again!!!

<Content>Wonderful Experience in Mayfair This was my first trip to England and several friends warned about the small rooms and high cost. True London is expensive however we had excellent value at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. Our room was well appointed and average size for a 2 twin accomodation. The bathroom was luxurious, turn down service and a full English breakfast was included for about $300.00 per day. The staff couldn't have been nicer and Mayfair is a beautiful neighborhood adjacent to Hyde Park and within walking distance to Buckingham Palace , Picadilly and public transportation. Don't miss the National Gallery and a nearby restaurant Cafe in the Crypt.

<Content>Not a good choice EXTREMELY disappointed with most everything about this hotel. The hotel staff at the front desk IS, as the other reviewer said, very arrogant. The service staff however, (maids, bellboys) were very friendly.The RESTAURANT leaves a lot to be desired for the prices they charge. Room service breakfast was cold 3 out of 4 days. In the dining room one morning, our waiter brought tea and coffee and then never returned to take a food order. For dinner, Chicken bouillibaise that tastes as if it came out of a crock pot is not my idea of gourmet. And sticky toffee pudding with melted ice cream on the side is far from appealing. For afternoon tea, the menu lists the teas available, but they were out of my first two choices. Apple juice was on the menu for breakfast. They were out of that too.One of the two elevators was out of service most days, leaving the stairs as the main mode of getting from one floor to another.The ROOM, in this case a suite, was tiny, even by London standards. The shower in the bathroom is not big enough to turn around in and the tub is a serious hazard when getting in and out of. It slopes and is very deep, albeit skinny. The noise from the street was overwhlemingly annoying and the traffic never stops. At all. You will hear trucks cabs and motorcycles all night. Several nights there was a live band playing, the beats of which permeate through the walls. The music will not be over until midnight, and if this is a problem for you, well too bad. The hotel seems to be helpless to do anything about it.The hotel is NOT a 5-10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace as the previous reviewer said. Even if you are a speed walker you couldn't get there in 5-10 minutes. It is more like a 20-25 minute walk. The closes tube station is about a 10-15 minute walk depending on your pace. There are many hotels closer to tube stops. You should stay as close to a tube stop as possible because you will likely be walking everywhere and that extra 30 minutes to/from the hotel from the tube stop adds up when you've already spent all day walking around London.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay in London... We stayed here for 3 nights/4 days in April 2004. It is the nicest place. We have nothing but good things to say about it. Their service is outstanding! The staff really goes above and beyond everytime they see you. Beautiful lobby/entrance area. We had a double room, very nicely decorated, extremely clean. The room could be considered small by American standards but very comfortably fit my husband and myself. Windows even opened to let in some fresh air. A full English breakfast was included with our room and boy do they mean full breakfast. You don't need to eat again until dinner! The food was great, we also enjoyed dinner in the restaurant, the best lamb I've ever eaten. Room service was also great and quick. Wonderful fish  chips. The hotel is within a 5-10 minute walk of Buckingham Palace and an easy walk to the tube. There is a Sainsbury's (grocery store) just a couple minutes away and also a Boots (drugstore) to pick up any things you might need. Umbrella's are available at the front desk  they will gladly hire a taxi for you. A fantastic place to stay. We booked directly off of their website red carnation hotels. Can without a doubt say this is where will we stay on our next trip to London.

<Content>Good Choice and Value We stayed at this Hotel for 6 nights starting the 19th of November , 2003. Rooms are small but after checking around it is about average for London. Service was good and the price included breakfast. ( we did it vis room service) Location is the best walking distance to everywhere! We will stay there again I think that you get value for your money considering the high prices everywhere in town. One must remember that it is a different kind of vacation. After checking out prices on travel website we found a great deal thru CruiseNerd they work with whole seller the good price did include the Outrages 17% taxes.
