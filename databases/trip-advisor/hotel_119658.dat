<Content>The lady need to adjust her attitude! This is a MOTEL, not a HOTEL. Do not expect too much. The bed is comfortable, bathroom is clean, location is not bad. These are the plus for this place. However, we were not pleased due to the following:(1) The wall is very thin and you can hear the coughing of neighbor room very clearly, not to mention if they are talking or watching TV or something else. Unluckily, our room has a connecting door with another room, and this make it a door in the middle instead of a wall. It's like someone sleeping right beside your shoulder.(2) This motel advertise complimentary breakfast, however, they really wish you don't go there to touch it. If you happened to bring food up for your room members, they will watch you like a thief and that special tone of talking make you feel you are stealing their breakfast instead. Suggest to the owner: PLEASE DON'T PROVIDE COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST IF YOU CAN NOT AFFORD TO. OTHERWISE, BE A LITTLE GENEROUS!! The old lady really need to change her attitude.(By my standard, she is not qualified to work at front desk at all). So, don't just look at the ranking, make sure you are staying at a MOTEL, NOT a hotel. With the price we are paying, we can book better hotels for sure.They advertise to be the best kept secret, please do your own research before you go. We will NOT return!!

<Content>Reasonable place to stay in SF We stayed overnight at the Castle Inn in San Francisco in November. It was a fairly convenient to Alcatraz Island and California Academy of Science in Golden Gate Park. We were looking for a reasonably priced  convenient location in SF that we did not have to pay for parking.  Very basic motel with comfortable beds, mini refrig and basic continental breakfast. It was within walking distance to quite a few restaurants (Miller's East Coast Deli-yummy!)  I did find that the clerk at the desk was rather unfriendly, though helpful. The free parking spaces were extremely tight for our mini van. The noise was not too bad, being only 1 block from Van Ness Ave.  If you are looking for a no frills, comfortable place to stay, Castle Inn was a good choice.

<Content>Perfect Stay, Very Clean I am very happy with our stay at Castle Inn. We booked through Orbitz, but I called to confirm our reservation via phone with the manager. From that first phone conversation, my experience with that motel was wonderful. Varsa greeted us at the front desk and very helpful and cheery! Our room was clean and smelled nice. The restroom appears to have been remodeled recently-added bonus! The motel has free parking and an elevator. This comes in very handy after walking all day:)The location is great. There are a couple of bus stops on the same block and everything is a short bus ride away. Varsa had many great recommendations for us that helped make our trip great. We were only in San Francisco for 2 full days and wanted to fit in alot. She was a huge factor in the enjoyment of our trip. Kudos to the Castle Inn!

<Content>Convenient location, good value The Castle Inn is an ideal place from which to explore San Francisco and if you do not want to pay the fancy rates on Fisherman's Wharf or in a boutique hotel. Within walking distance of both the Wharf and Downtown, only 5 minutes by car from the Golden Gate Bridge and in an interesting area off Polk Street /Van Ness. Some good restaurants nearby and busy cafes within a couple of minutes.The room was spacious, clean and quiet although the bathroom was smallish. Breakfast, collected from Reception was pretty basic, possibly the only downside. Helpful owners, staff, particularly when we left a camera and for a late arrival (midnight). Whilst we did not use it, good parking on site.

<Content>Excellent - would definitely stay there again Good value for the price. The hotel doesn't look much from the outside but it's conveniently situated within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf and the rooms are fine and well equipped.The continental breakfast (collect at reception to eat in the room) is both free and OK.The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. For example, we asked them to call us a cab - after waiting outside for 10 minutes they noticed that we were still there and called the taxi firm again.

<Content>Pleasant stay - cheap and chearful Stayed by accident as many places booked out the weekend we stayed and drove by the Castle Inn and dropped in. The girl at the desk was very friendly and helpful and gave us plenty hints on planning our visit to San Francisco and on getting around. The rooms are clean and spacious and everything works, which is more than can be said for most of the hotels and motels we stayed in during our trip. We had free parking and could take a free breakfast to our rooms on a tray - both extra in most places. Would stay again for our next visit. A luxury hotel it is not, but if cheap and chearful is what you are looking for, I highly recommend it.

<Content>Great Spot Staying for 2 night great little place not a Boutique hotel by any standards but it does what it says on the tin. Bed bath and great location. Easy walk to Fishermans Wharf down Polk st one of the few flat roads in the city. Found a great little cafe place on Polk come out of hotel turn right to Polk and up 2 blocks on the Jackson cross, over the road from great coffee shop too, Bay Creperie try the club sanwich . Take the Alkatraz trip walk down Polk towards bay but turn right on Bay st and walk for 25mins you miss the tourist nasty areas and get straight to Pier 33. Free Parking, great staff but no safe in rooms. For ATM turn left out hotel up Van ness and bank one block up on right.

<Content>functional and friendly On first sight the Castle hotel is not great, but the rooms are fine and the location is good once you get your bearings.Varsa, the hotel manageress was wonderful.She advised us to buy an 18 dollar , 3 day public transport pass which was well worth the money and enabled us to use the bus and trolley system all day long.If you are looking for luxury then the Castle is not for you, but for a clean, convenient place to stay its great.

<Content>Castle Inn is Motel 6 in San Francisco My husband and our 2 daughters stayed at the Castle Inn 2 nights. Upon arrival, before 3:00, we were not allowed to check in. After a 4 hour drive, we needed to use the restroom, but their was none. The clerk was rude and could not recommend a close facility. The property is old an dated, We checked in a couple hours later to a room with 2 queen beds. The room was very small with a bathroom not large enough to dress in. The refrigerator and tub drain didn't work. For $225 a night, I was very disapointed with the accomodations! I would not recommend or return. Pay the few extra dollars for a chain hotel close to pier 39.

<Content>Ideal and very very friendly. Just about everything you read on tripadvisor about the Castle Inn is true. It is15mins walk down to F/Wharf or 15mins up to Union Square / Chinatown area. Simple but sufficient complimentary breakfast (coffee, good orange juice, yoghurt, fruit, pastry, cereal bars) left us satisfied (including 2 teenagers!). Stayed in the 2 bedroom-suite. A little noise from the street, and some noise from the ice machine just outside the room, but with ear plugs in (always travel with them!), had a good night's sleep. San Francisco is an expensive city, and the Castle Inn offers excellent value. Special mention to Varsa, the effusively helpful manageress, who provided all sorts of details about tours and transport. We could not have enjoyed SF as much without her help. There is an excellent Thai restaurant - simple, fast service and great value - just 3 doors away for a convenient meal. In advance of us arriving, we had asked Varsa to book us onto a city tour with Tower Tours including the Alcatraz tour, and I would fully recommend this, because you will get to see the slightly more out-of-town sights like twin peaks, Golden Gate Park, leaving you to explore the inner city stuff on foot later. Don't miss out Alcatraz - it is incredible. Our family really enjoyed US Pampanito too. Different!If I was a millionaire I'd stay in a luxury hotel. But as a family, out sightseeing from early after breakfast until after our evening meal, the Castle Inn is absolutely ideal.

<Content>Excellent value for money We stayed here in June 2008 as the first stop on a long road trip. We were not disappointed. The owners were on hand immediately with maps and directions. It was well rehearsed but nonethless a helpful introduction. The hotel is as is said on all the reviews in a great location and we walked to all the must see areas, *Do not miss Alcatraz by the way if you are in SF*. We stayed in a room facing the inner yard which was quiet . The room itelf was clean and well provided with coffee maker, fridge and microwave. Nothing is particularly new but this is not a problem. No complaints.

<Content>Great location, tired rooms. Stayed for 4 nights in the 2 bedroom suite as the first stop on a trip down the east coast. Briliant location, busses run on the two streets either side(Van Ness  Polk), so transport links were great for any location. A three day MUNI pass for all above ground public transport cost only $18 so we used these a lot. Many nice places to eat on Polk street as well. Back to the hotel, reception was small but the staff were helpfull, the suite faced onto the street and did suffer noise, but heck you are in a city it never troubled us. The rooms were large, the beds comfortable, the shower was hot. My only critisism would be that the rooms and furniture were showing their age. In fact while we were there, a builder arrived to price up modernising the bathroom, and the staff said that several were being done soon. All in all location is the big plus for the hotel, i did see that Nob Hill motor inn and Broadway motel are very close as well but obviously i dont know what they were like, but they would also be located well.

<Content>Castle Inn - Great Location We stopped here for 4 nights. I booked directly with the Inn and they were easy to deal with. They responded quickly to all my email queries and were very helpful. On arrival I was a bit put out, as the rooms looked a bit dark and shabby. The continental breakfast was limited, and some rooms will suffer from traffic noise. However, the maid service was very good and the location was spot on. It was easily walkable to Fishermans Wharf and the buses and cable cars were just a few minutes walk away. There were also plenty of places to eat and some small shops just minutes away. Getting to any where from here was easy. The front desk staff also let us know the places to go and where not to venture and they also gave us maps and a great list of buses to use to get to see all the sights. Overall, the Inn was good value for money, location was excellent and we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>excellent location 4th trip to san fran stayed at all levels of cost and location this was all that the reviews said, great location handy to public transportation and most importanly FREE PARKING despite some statements parking was not a space problem, very clean, also a more than helpful and pleasant staff, walk to many resturants and as i said very close to public transportation. cont breakfast was just that, but it was more than enough to start the day so going out to breakfast was not a cost if you so choose Value is definetly worth the stay i stayed prior stays on columbus near lombard, a block from union square also a block from pier 39 i will if i return will absolutely stay here again

<Content>Fantastic place to stay We stayed here for three nights in April on a whirlwind trip of San Francisco. Although I have given it five stars, please note that it not a five star hotel (and doesn't claim to be) but my experience of it warrants five stars.We booked this hotel based on the good reviews on Tripadvisor and we are so glad that we did.Due to flight delays we didn't get to the hotel until 11:30pm. We called ahead and the kept the office open late and waited for us to arrive. When we checked in we were given maps of San Francisco, details of transport to various sites and a few places to avoid which was fantastic.We love to walk and walked everywhere from the hotel. If you walk from the hotel along Polk it is a lot flatter than most of the road down to Fishermans Wharf. It took us about 10-15 mins to get there so it is convenient.The rooms are spacious and comfortable and I never noticed lots of noise either from other guests or from traffic outside. There did not seem to be a lot of amenities that you may expect in hotels but then we were out visiting sites etc all day and were only really there to sleep so it was perfect for us.The owners are very friendly and only too happy to help, the rooms are great, it is convenient and it is definitely worth staying here.Highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great service - thanks! Stayed here 1st of May to 4th of May. We had a great stay, my parents, my husband and I and our 8 month baby. We had the first 2 rooms on the first floor (facing Broadway). The rooms where clean and big enough for our requrements. They are not huge - however I do NOT agree that there's not enough space to even get around the beds! The central location, the microwave, the coffemaker and the free parking was the reasons we choose this Inn. There where off course noice from the street, but tell me where in SF there's not? And we where not bothered by the noice since we got up early every day anyway. Didn't have any expectations regarding the breakfast so we weren't disapointed - I'm just glad that there where youghurt, coffe and fresh fruit :-) The big breakfast we had at Polker's wich was recomended to us by the staff at the Hotel. Superb!Out of the 17 days we spent in the States, this was asolutely the place with the best service!!! Thank you for all your advice, directions and finding adresses :-) We'll be back some day...

<Content>Basic Accomodations With No Frills We stayed at the Castle Inn in June 2008. The location is convenient to tourist attractions and public transportation. Our room was clean but a bit rundown. Don't count on the breakfast that is included; instant coffee and packaged muffins, etc. Better to go down the street to one of the local bagel shops or coffee shops.The lady at the front desk needs some sensitivity training. We observed her being just plain rude to some of the other guests.Overall, you get what you pay for. A low-cost place to sleep with no frills.

<Content>Good Clean Affordable Accomodation We stayed here in May 2008 based on the reviews on here! We weren't dissapointed. Just to be clear upfront - this is not a luxury hotel by any means, but for the price and location you couldn't ask for much more. The rooms were clean and had fridge and microwave which was a bonus. The shower was hot and the pressure good. What really set this apart though was the customer service we received from Varsa at the front desk. She couldn't have been more helpful, whipping out a map of the city of San Fran as soon as we checked in, circling all the best places to go, and highlighting the areas to avoid. We parked the car in their free car park (which we didn't find too tight or small contrary to other reviews on here, though we could understand how some may have found it a little tight in places). The car wasn't needed for our stay though as the hotel is just a few yards from a main bus route so we got a 3 day MUNI pass and used the frequent buses and trams during our stay. Breakfast is literally some baskets of pre-packaged Danishes Pastries and Nutrigrain bars, with Coffee and Orange Juice available. Nothing glamorous but adequate if you just want to grab a bite on your way out! There are also many eateries within a stones throw of the hotel (we recommend 'Polkers').The hotel is not going to be for everyone, particularly those who want or need to maybe spend a lot of time in their hotel room, but if you are looking for affordable, clean and safe accomodation in San Francisco, then this would be a good choice to make.

<Author>barely alive
<Content>good price, clean, extremely basic room I picked the Castle Inn because of Trip Advisor reviews but I guess I have to do some more analysis of the individual comments.It was very highly rated yet the room couldn't be more basic. It had two queen beds yet there was hardly room to get out of the beds on the wall side and there were only two chairs in the room, and no table. There was a desk but most of it was taken up by a microwave.Breakfast is offered but its instant coffee, prepackaged danish and an apple and yogurt.The room was clean, fairly quiet for a city and considering that the walkway is within 2 feet of one of the beds. A very long counter, maybe 7 feet, for the bathroom sink was very nice. The location isn't the classiest but is fairly convenient to some tourist areas such as the Lombard St and some decent but modest restaurants.Parking is free.

<Content>Excellent Base My partner and I used this as a base to explore SF and found it ideally located, within easy walk of convenience stores, sights, restaurants, bars and the bay where you can catch a beautiful sunset behind the bridge. Accommodation was fine, very clean and well kept, but wouldn't consider it modern compared to the main stream Holiday Inn, Hilton etc. Car parking is very tight, so SUVs and larger saloons may struggle in peak periods. However, the huge selling point with this Inn are the hosts. Follow their advice, recommendations and cautions and you'll not go wrong. We knew exactly where it was safe to go, until what time at night, and were pointed to some fabulous eateries. Highly recommended.

<Content>Good low cost place to stay Four ladies wanting a low cost and safe place to stay while in San Francisco. The Castle Inn was a great choice for us. Loved the free off street parking (fit the full size car just fine) and location. The free continental breakfast (yougert, granola bars, fruit, pasteries) were great to bring back to our room or take and go. Nothing fancy but good and basic. The free hot chocolate at night was appreciated as it gets cold outside at night. We walked -downhill- to Fisherman's Warf and spent the day there and a $10 taxi ride brought us back in the evening. The next day we spent the $11 each and bought an all day pass for the cable car/bus transportation. The pass got us all over town. The cable car stop is 2 blocks away and the bus stop is a block away. The local resturants were reasonably priced and pleasant. The room had a refrigerator and microwave (to heat up leftover resturant food). Liked how the sink was outside of the bathroom, making it easier for the four of us to get ready in the morning. The rooms were clean and quiet (we were on the 3rd floor). The hotel personnel were friendly and helpful. If you are looking to be pampered the pay the extra to stay elsewhere but if you want a clean, basic hotel then stay here. There is too much to see and do in San Francisco to spend time in the hotel room anyway.

<Content>Recommend The Castle Inn We highly recommend The Castle Inn if you are looking for a good, clean, quiet value for money budget motel located on Russian Hill. It is a walk, cable car or bus ride to Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf (eat at Scomas, everywhere else seems to be tourist traps) and everywhere else. It is close to public transport with connections that can take you all over SF. We walked a few blocks and then rode buses to Coit Tower, Haight Ashbury, AMC Cinema and the Golden Gate Bridge for instance.Varsa was very helpful with our Internet booking and Marshall was super friendly and helpful on check-in. He looked after our luggage for us when we arrived early the morning of check-in. Marshall gave us a map and wrote down the places to see (and the areas to avoid). Varsa arranged some very good tours for us.The hotel is close to many many restaurants that offer delicious and fresh food at reasonable prices, mostly on Polk Street. We stayed a week and ate very well each night in a different establishment. Also on Polk is a Walgreens drug store (pharmacy/supermarket) and organic markets. Polk hosts a very good value laundry and dry cleaner (turn right from the Castle Inn, cross Polk and turn right, you will find it just up the hill from Broadway).The rooms are a good size and clean; we had a non-smoking room with a comfortable queen bed. There is some street noise, but not intrusive. We heard footsteps from the room above.The breakfast is not that good tho: lots of fat, sugar and carbs. We purchased fruit, yogurt and granola from the organic market on Polk (the market has plastic spoons available free of charge, we ate the granola from the cups in the room). The 鈥榝ridge and microwave were very useful.Marshall can arrange a Town Car transfer. The fare from the airport was $55. You can call the car direct on 415 756 7402, ask for Jun.We will return to San Francisco and stay at the Castle Inn.

<Content>Great location We spent 7 days at the Castle Inn at the beginning of this month. Booking the hotel was really easy and Varsa came back confirming the booking and rest of details. Getting to the hotel from the airport is very simple as it is close to Van Ness ( 101). In less than 30 minutes you are there. The location of the hotel is excellent for traveling around ( 49 miles scenic route, Napa, Marine County,..) and also for using public transportation as the cable car taking you to the center or to Fisherman's Wharf is at two blocks distance. There are also a couple of buses at Van Ness which takes you downtown.Although some people at this site complain about noise, the only noise that sometimes was disturbing was the neighbors' one. The walls seem to be really thin and anything happening next door is like if was happening inside the room. We were at one of the middle rooms of the third floor and from there we hardly listen any noise from the nearby avenue. Room was OK and better than what you can expect from the price you pay. It is modest but very clean and with no carpet smell ( something that sometimes you cannot avoid at US or UK hotels where there are carpets everywhere). We did not use the microwave or the fridge as we spent most of the time out either traveling in the area or just enjoying the city. I understand that these facilities may be better appreciated by families traveling with children.Last, I would like to highlight the great information provided by Varsa on arrival, letting us know about highlights, things we should not miss and other tips. The same in the mornings, making sure that everyone can get what they want for breakfast. She really cares and makes you feel like at home. By the way, the same cannot be say about the other person who was there when Varsa was off. I recommend the Castle Inn for group of friends, families and everyone who wants to explore the city and enjoy holidays.

<Content>great location, service and price overall rating reflects heavy emphasis on value - this is far from a luxury, or a new or a newly refurbished or a full service hotel.the high value experience begins with booking and communicating directly with Varsa. her email communication is excellent - even when away from the inn on holiday. she booked a tour for us, responded with advice on itinerary scheduling, restaurant recommendations (pesce and yabbies coastal kitchen were both excellent), and advice on public transportation and possible walks. they secured our luggage for us when we arrived early the morning of check-in and let us park through the dinner hour after check-out. value for the price: $99 + 14% tax @ night for a double queen in an interesting  fun area of san francisco (in march) with FREE PARKING. our room offered a decent tv, desk/chair, small area with counter/mirror, hanging, frig  microwave adjacent to room with toilet/shower. the furnishings and conditions were clean and adequate (not new or strikingly attractive). the beds were comfortable and fairly firm with some give. Our room was in the middle of the 2nd floor of a three floor structure. it is not thoroughly insulated. we heard some noise above of us one night and some street noise (it's a half block off of Van Ness). the noise fits in with the feel of a busy neighborhood - which we enjoyed. there are many restaurant choices for varying budgets within easy walking distance. we also walked to fisherman's wharf. We took the trolley or the bus to most sights. we did drive to muir woods (we thoroughly enjoyed our walk through there) and to one dinner on the coast at Sutro's at the Cliff House (absolutely incredible). We obviously enjoyed our stay at the castle inn.

<Content>Great place to stay Our first trip to San Francisco. The Castle Inn is in a great location to explore the city and great value for money. Very friendly and helpful reception on arrival and throughout our 3 night stay. Spacious room. Our 2 young children enjoyed riding the elevator! The free parking is great and no need to use the car at all while exploring the city. Recommended.

<Content>The Good, The Bad and the So So Location - The Good - location for using the local transit - short walks to the Muni bus and cable car line. The Bad - location is Noisy! - lots of traffic noise from Van Ness and Broadway. We had a 2nd floor room mid-way in the building. Bring ear-plugs if truck horns, sirens, traffic, Harley-Davidsons roaring by keep you from sleeping. The walls are thin and you can hear every conversation in the adjacent rooms, as well as the plumbing.Staff - Friendly staff ready to help people from out of town - especially for knowing where NOT to go after dark or if you are traveling with kids.Facilities - rooms were clean. Nice having the microwave and compact refrigerator. Beds were satisfactory. Bring your laptop and take advantage of the WiFi to check the SF MTA routes and schedules. Take heed about the parking area - not designed for full sized SUVs.Don't forget the 13% city hotel tax when budgeting your trip!

<Content>Castle Inn Good Budget Choice My teen son and I stayed at Castle Inn in March of 2007 and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. Location was excellent, right outside the door are a number of buses up and down Van Ness that will take you anywhere around town.Breakfast was basic but sufficient, and the owners were very helpful. Free car parking was excellent, I was driving a Toyota Highlander and although parking space was tight, it was fine.We will stay there again.

<Content>Great motel, but... The Castle Inn is a great find if you're looking for a great motel. It's not a hotel. It's a good, inexpensive stay in an expensive city. Just about everything you've read is true. Marshall at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful. The location, other than being on a listless patch of concrete called Broadway Ave, is terrific, centrally located to all of SF and around the block from a Strabucks, a Peets, a great bagel place and a Real Foods market, in addition to a wonderfully charming neighborhood. Free parking, free internet, all very good. But here's the one warning:The family suite, where I stayed with my wife and our two kids, had room to spare, but it's noisy. The ice machine is right outside the door and it recycles regularly, and the front of the room is over the street and very noisy. Cars, trucks, etc, especially during the morning rush. You've been warned.

<Content>Excellent friendly staff We stayed for four nights at the Castle Inn and enjoyed every minute of it. The room was spacious and clean and the oversized bathroom was a bonus.The staff at reception were always helpful and cheery and nothing was too much trouble. Even giving us super directions to start our road trip.The breakfast was more substantial than we thought it would be so again a good bonus.We would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>You Get What You Pay For This hotel has many pluses and minuses. On the plus side the staff is very friendly. There is free parking, however the garage entrance is extremely narrow and only small cars can get in and maneuver inside. The beds are average quality. They also give you tiny soap bars, so I went out and purchased my own. However, they have good shower heads. The TV remote control is old and does not work very well, and I did not get HBO as advertised. There is a small fridge and microwave in the room. They provide free pastries and coffee for breakfast. The locations is good. The price is low by San Francisco standards, but remember you get what you pay for.

<Content>Brilliant city, lovely hotel, wonderful hosts I took the advice of Trip Advisor's top 100 ratings and found this hotel to be perfect for my short visit to SF. Price, location and hotel facilities were excellent. I stayed in the Suite with my 2 sons and got a nice room all to myself - with tv and coffee maker. The owners of the hotel were lovely - extremely friendly and helpful. The free car parking and lovely choice of goodies for breakfast were added bonuses rarely found in US hotels. I'd definitely stay there again and recommend anyone else to make it their first choice too.

<Content>Castle Inn, San Francisco The Castle Inn is a Motel with external hallways/room entrances located in the Polk Street area of San Francisco. The rooms are best described as spartan with amenities including parking, wireless internet, continental breakfast, microwave and two-door fridge. The noise levels from street level traffic, as well as motel guest traffic, are high and disconcerting at times. The continental breakfast is misleading and not accurately reflected on the website (nor by comments from the owners).Our expectations, derived primarily from TripAdvisor's ranking of the Castle Inn (at the time 11th among approx. 230 San Francisco Hotels), were not met. Although all amenities listed on the Castle Inn's website were offered, the motel should not be included/compared with Hotels (this may be a TripAdvisor concern/problem). Unfortunately for travelers (anticipating a Hotel) and the Castle Inn, the opportunity for disappointment arises directly from these ratings.We found much better accommodation and value in San Francisco.

<Content>Impressed with staff We arrived late from the airport and were impressed with the desk service. We were given a map, shown where and where not to go and given advice to go to a great little pub around the corner on Polk with excellent food at a reasonable cost.No problems with the room, the king bed was comfortable and for a downtown location, quieter than might be expected. Little noise from other customers of the hotel. The room was clean, comfortable and adequate. I have been a traveller for 25+ years and am demanding on a few levels. The Castle Inn met these expectations and I have no complaints. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the location was right for our sightseeing. Staff stored our luggage and arranged shuttle pickup to the airport, as well as booking us a tour of the city on our first day. This was excellent as well. All in all, the hotel was as advertised and we would stay there again.

<Content>Great location The hotel is ideally located, close to buses and in walking distance to the waterfront. Polk St is a great location for restaurants and cafes and the neighborhood is safe and residential. All these things were the reason we chose the hotel. The room was clean and reasonably priced, nothing fancy. It was very noisy, though. We could hear absolutely everything through the connecting door to the room next door and could easily hear the people moving about in the room above us as well. Ear plugs advised!! Breakfast isn't worth bothering with either. However, there are lovely cafes within a block or two. I'd recommend La Boulange de Polk. Good dinner at Little Thai on the corner as well. I'd stay there again.

<Content>A Gem in the Heart of San Fran! We (2 couples) stayed at the Castle Inn for two nights (Jan 2-4 2008) and couldn鈥檛 have been more pleased with our experience. Our room rate with tax was about $90 per night. Upon our check-in, we were warmly greeted by Varsa, who not only assisted us with our check-in, but also provided directions/maps, recommendations to numerous restaurants, as well as printed out our boarding passes for the next leg of our trip. One of our rooms was in the front and faced Broadway, the other more towards the back. Both rooms were clean, roomy, comfy, and quiet. Noise was not an issue for either room. Both rooms also included a coffee maker w/coffee, refrigerator, and microwave. We brewed our coffee each morning, and used the 鈥榝ridge鈥?and 鈥榳ave鈥?to keep and reheat our leftovers. We started our mornings early, so grabbing breakfast to go from the office-- fruit, muffins, breakfast bars, yogurt, juice鈥o name a few, was a bonus. Parking was not an issue either. It may be a little tight, but totally manageable.All in all, the Castle Inn is a great place, whether you call it an inn, motel, hotel, or whatever you want to name it. The price was in line with the amenities that were offered, and I will, without a doubt, stay here again on my next visit.And here鈥檚 a note to the complainers: WAKE UP! This is San Francisco 鈥?the fact that they have parking, and it is free, is a bonus; the fact that they offer 鈥済rab-n-go鈥?breakfast, is a bonus; and the fact that they are conveniently located in a safe neighborhood near shopping and restaurants, is a bonus! If you would have done your homework before checking in, you would have known what to expect.

<Content>Great Location for Staying in the City, Ok for the Price The Castle Inn is an older motel type establishment. Slightly run down and sparten but clean and very well managed by a friendly and helpful couple. Our room was clean and the only issue I had was that the walls and floors did little to keep out noise from other rooms (were those elephants above us?). Stay in an upper floor I would guess to lessen this problem. Here's the bonuses: FREE PARKING! Also, you are situated right on the edge of a fun neighborhood on Polk Street. Lots of good restaurants, bars and local shops in easy walking distance. Also if you want to get around town, a cable car is 3 blocks away (best way to get downtown!) and a bunch of city buses (MUNI) stop nearby to take you almost anywher in the city pretty quick. I'll be staying here again.

<Content>Less than expected Booked here based on the glowing reviws AND the price. Stayed 2 nights on business and sightseeing trip. The price was good, based on other hotels and the included parking was nice, but as one review said, the garage was tough to negotiate.It really is a motel, not a hotel. No AC, and my room faced Broadway, which was LOUD at all hours - had to open window for air. The breakfast was lousy coffee from an old percolator and some granola bars and yogurt.The wireless internet was VERY inconsistent, and when it did connect, the signal was poor. (only a b network anyway). The decor was straight from the 70's, but serviceable enough.I did not see the wonderful hostess at the desk, the person who helped me was OK, but nothing special.If you want a cheap place to stay in a good neighborhood, this is your place, but don't expect too much!

Front desk people were always helpful and nice, hotel is not a Hilton Price for a night is about $100 pretty good considering how much the others places charge. Hotel is clean and safe, breakfast isn't something to write home about but again for the price this place fit our needs for three nights. Bagel place around the block and a Starbucks very close by, up the street on Polk is very good hamburger/family place the served nice food and good service.

<Content>Not as good as I expected I guess I had high expectations after reading all the glowing reviews on Trip Advisor. We stayed at the Castle Inn for 5 nights over Christmas. Location is pretty good ... only 3 blocks from the cable car line and about 10 blocks to the waterfront. Buses run up and down Van Ness St. The staff kept the room very clean. But the walls of this place were paper-thin! The first night there were two couples in the next room talking and laughing loudly until 2 a.m. ... then they started up again at 7 a.m. If they hadn't checked out I would have asked to be moved because it was impossible to sleep. The next neighbors must have packed all their clothes in plastic sacks because they were constantly rattling sacks ... yes, we could hear this through the walls. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee, some store-bought gooey pastries and fruit. Fortunately there was a great diner across the street - Peter D's - where you can get a real breakfast. Yes, parking is free but negotiating the tiny cramped garage is quite a challenge. We got the room for only $99-$115 during our stay but I was looking longingly at the Holiday Inn down the street wondering if it was any better.

<Content>Good Choice for the Price We stayed at the Castle Inn for two nights. We flew into SFO and took the Bart to the Civic Center station and then rode the Muni bus #47 to the Broadway stop. This put us within a half block from the motel. Our room was very pleasant. It had a two door refrigerator, microwave, comfortable queen size bed, and was very clean. It is an older motel but appears very well taken care of. Our continental breakfast included danish, fruit, yogurt and juice. Since we enjoy walking, we took in Fisherman's Wharf, Alcartraz, Giradehelli Square and China Town on foot. Be prepared to walk up and down hills to get to any of these locations. The trolley and buses though are a good alternative to walking if you get tired of trudging up and down the hills of San Francisco. I would stay at this motel again and would recommend it to others as a very good place to stay at a very reasonable price.

<Content>don't see what the big deal is I stayed here my 1st night in SF because of all the 5-star tripadvisor recommandations.The hosts are very nice, yes, the motel (it's not really a hotel) is located in a beautiful neighbourhood, everything is clean, but the price is rather steep compared to very similar motels that are everywhere, also in this neighbourhood.I payed around 120 dollars for a night, and other motels I stayed in in SF in the same week were $60-100 and weren't really different.Next time I won't stay here because of that.

<Content>Just Perfect!!! My husband and I stayed at the Castle Inn in San Francisco for 2 nights last week and it was the perfect place, the hosts, Varsa and Sy were so friendly and helpful, especially Varsa, who booked us tours and helped us with maps to get around the city. The room was very large and clean, with a microwave and small fridge, and they served a very nice little breakfast in the morning. It was close to everything, we even walked back from the Fisherman's Wharf. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. Very reasonably priced also. Thank You.

<Content>Perfect base Booked this Inn after checking the reviews on tripadvisor and was not let down. The Inn makes a perfect base to visit the city. As first timers to SF, 3 of us stayed at the Inn for 4 nights during the month of October and we were highly satisfied. The room with 2 double beds was roomy enough to fit all our luggage and still make us feel comfortable (we were traveling from overseas and doing a 3-week trip through California). It was clean, quiet (guess low season helped too) and the people at the front desk were extremely helpful (numerous maps and advices were given and they helped us booked our car service to the airport, etc.). The Inn is 5 minutes from one of the main trolley lines, next door to some bus lines and a 20-30 minute walk to Grant Ave. in Chinatown. Bus passes can be bought 5 minutes away as well. The coffee maker in the room as well as additional coffee, hot chocolate, OJ, muffins, fruits, etc. available at the front office early in the am makes it ideal to get ready early in the morning to go explore the city all day. The free parking was wonderful too.All in all, we had a very pleasant stay, with amazing prices for such a nice location and for all the little extras we had. would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Stop !! Look nowhere else!! This place is amazing; Location, service, local bars and transport and you can even see the Bridge from the roof!! Booked a 2 x Queen bed room for four nights via Varsa the owner and it was worth every penny. Big comfy rooms with a fridge, microwave and coffee making stuff ( supplied every morning).This place is ideal for the casual traveler like myself and my friend, a family or even some one just there for the night The place feels more like a hotel rather than that of a motel and the owners make you feel like a person and not a room number like some do, by supplying maps, directions, advice and a warm welcome. They even booked an airport shuttle for me at a moments notice on the morning I was leaving!! Polk Street is across the road and it's bars are great. But if your 'Going to San Francisco' - never mind the flowers in your hair ,just a good pair of walking shoes and then get ready for the steepest roads your every going to see/ walk. And some breath taking views of a wonderful exciting safe city.If I get the chance to make it back to the West Coast, I won't bother scouring the internet for places to stay - I'll just phone Varsa and book a room at the Castle Inn.

<Content>Great little Inn in San Francisco My husband and I stayed at the Castle Inn for our first trip to San Francisco. It was just what we were looking for. We didn't want to stay in the hustle and bustle of the Wharf and this was perfect. It was in a quiet neighborhood away from all the tourist areas. The room was not an upscale luxury room but clean and comfortable with a microwave and fridge/freezer, after all we were there to see the sights and not spend all our time in a motel. Within walking distance is a Subway, donut shop, Escape from New York pizza, Peter D's (open for breakfast and lunch and has a great breakfast), Walgreens, Starbucks, a Tai restaurant, a local bar/restaraunt (excellent hamburgers), and a small grocery. We felt safe walking to these places. We purchased a 7 day muni pass that gets you on any bus, cable car, bart, and f-market street car. The passes are 24.00 but well worth it. A one way trip on the cable car is 5.00 so the pass is the best way to go. Marshall, at the hotel desk, gave us a map of the bus routes and gave us information on where to go, how to get there and where not to go. We asked about some tours and Arlene called and made our reservations and we got a discount from the hotel booking for us. They were very helpful and we really appreaciated their information as this was our first trip.As for the breakfast, it was as advertised, a continental breakfast. It was perfect for someone in a hurry to get going in the morning. We took advantage of this our first morning but then went out for breakfast or purchased donuts around the corner to have in our room. We enjoyed our stay at the Castle Inn and would stay there again if we ever get to return to San Francisco.

<Content>Castle Inn - a little gem We were encouraged by Tripadvisor reviews and not disappointed. The room was spacious, clean and well-equipped. The location was very convenient. The staff were young, efficient and pleasant but the real advantage of this hotel is the owners whose hospitality and local knowledge make you feel as though you are staying as welcome guests. The only disadvantage was that its popularity meant we were unable to stay on for additional nights on the spur of the moment. We would definitely return.

<Content>Quiet, Clean, Great Value -Best Little Motel in SF! The Castle Inn is our favorite small hotel in San Francisco! We have stayed there on 2 occasions  the wonderful staff, convenient location,  clean, quiet rooms keep us coming back! Located at Broadway  Van Ness, Castle Inn is in a nice neighborhood with drug store, grocery, cafes  cute shops within close walking distance. It's also right on the bus line  is a straight shot down to Fisherman's Wharf. My dad  I stayed for 4 quiet  comfortable nights. We rented a car on our previous trip, but found that with a little planning, getting around on the bus was an easier  less costly option. The Castle Inn does offer free parking though, which is a real bonus in SF! Parking throughout SF is difficult, pricey  hard to find. For this trip, we purchased 3-day Muni Passes at the airport when we arrived,  used those to travel the city on busses  cable cars - a good value if you don't mind the challenges of riding city busses! Make sure you get a bus route map when you purchase your Muni Passes!Rooms at the Castle are clean  comfortable - not fancy or large, but decent  reasonably priced compared to many SF hotels. Our 2-bed room had a hairdryer, small fridge, coffee maker, free cable tv  table with 2 large chairs. Our 3rd floor room overlooked a lovely yard of trees next door  we could just see a bit of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. There is a nice little continental breakfast (coffee, cocoa, yogurt, fruit, pastries, granola bars) in the lobby. The best feature of the Castle Inn is our favorite hostess, Versa! She is always so pleasant, accomodating  knowledgeable with good advice about the city. They also gave us a chart showing busses/stop locations to go to various tourist locations throughout the city. Castle Inn also has a nice website worth checking out.If you want a clean, decent room to sleep in at night  a hot shower in the morning without a lot of pricey luxury, the Castle Inn is a little gem of a motel in a convenient location to get to the tourist attractions easily. I have  will continue to recommend San Francisco's Castle Inn to anyone considering a trip to the City by the Bay!

<Content>Castle Inn great value Booked the Castle Inn direct and got an informative e-mail back which set the standard for the 4 night stay. The room was a standard motel room which was very clean and decoration good, equipped with microwave and fridge/freezer. The lady on the desk gave us lots of information about what to see, where to go and where not to go when we checked in. She was very helpful throughout the stay. Overall great value, agood place to stay and will be staying there next time I'm in San Francisco

<Content>Not Worth for Money... I stayed in Castle Inn, SF in Sep. 2007 for 2 nights. I read many reviews of Tripadvisor and booked directly with the hotel. My expectation was so high after leaning about the hotel from Tripadvisor reviews, but must say, Not Worth for Money... The best thing of this hotel was the super helpful staff. What I disliked at this accomodation were; the really not nice breakfast, the expencive price, the poor water pressured shower and the uncomfy beds. I'm not quite sure why people on Tripadvisor have given Excellent to this hotel... To me, it was just OK. I did stay in two other hotels this time in SF; Baldwin Hotel on Grant street (Perfect location, can't even compare with Castle Inn) and Mayflower Hotel on Bush (another great location with an delicious Italian restaurant near by). Both offer much cheaper rates of rooms and great service and rooms. Mayflower gives you a good sized breakfast too. One thing, though, those two don't have free parking spaces for you. If I ever go back to the city, Id definitely consider those two, not, Castle Inn, which everyone here in Tripadvisor seems to be very impressed...

<Content>Excellent location, helpful staff I didn't have high hopes for the Castle Inn, we booked it at the last minute prior to a long road trip, but boy was I proved wrong.The rooms are pretty standard, but are clean and comfortable, but the hotel's location, close to Polk Street/Broadway is an ideal location as it's out of the main tourist areas, but close to many great restaurants and bars that the locals go to, so you can experience the real San Francisco.Also the girl at reception, sorry I've forgotten your name, was very very helpful, within 5 minutes of arriving she had given us a map and marked on it the best places to go (and the places to avoid) and continued to be helpful, giving excellent restaurant and bar recommendations, all within walking distance. If I go back to San Francisco, i'll definately go here.

<Content>Very Good I found the Castle Inn on tripadvisor and was really glad I tried it. The price was right on and like the other reviewer said the neighborhood has a more local flavor to it. It's in walking distance of Fishermans Wharf, North Beach ect. Varsa at the front desk was very helpful and cheerful never tireing of questions she must get asked hundreds of times. The Wifi had some trouble but after taking my laptop to the office and then back to my room it worked fine. I needed a couple more nights at the last minute, The Castle was already booked to extend my stay and Varsa was kind to help me find the Nob Hill Motel around the block which I also recomend.

<Content>Perfect stay at The Castle Inn Can't say enough about The Castle Inn. I did lots of research on the web before we booked and I'm certainly glad I did. Varsa and Sy were the very best...always a help about where to eat, how to get around and where to go. Every morning it was Good morning. How did you sleep?and it was always genuine.They always took the time to speak with you and I don't know how they did it but they always knew our names and room number and we weren't problem guests either. The room was always spotless and cleaned early. There wasn't a speck anywhere. It was never noisy either. It's not large and maybe that's a good thing. Even when there was no vacancy it was quiet.The breakfast was more than adequate with yogourt,fresh fruit, muffins,pastries,coffee,tea and juice.We spoke with other people who stayed at other hotels we were considering. We didn't get very positive reviews from them. I don't know how the hotels are rated but if it is on cleanliness,location and friendliness of the staff and owners then they sure deserve a 4 star not the 2 they were given.I wanted to hug Varsa good-bye when we left.The location was perfect for us..about ten blocks to the wharf andclose to two bus routes but we walked most of the time to the wharf.It took us no time to orientate ourselves. The neighbourhood was very clean and safe. Although safe is a word that I heard lots,I never felt unsafe anywhere. We were warned not to go to the tenderloin area as it wasn't the best area. We inadvertently ended up there one day and yes there are more homeless there but they weren't a botherThe 3 day bus pass was the way to go. It got you on all means of transportation. We spent one day just roaming the city,on and off the buses,etc.We sure saw alot.If you want a great hotel with great people for a reasonable amount of money book with The Castle Inn. You won't be disappointed.

<Content>Loved Castle Inn My husband and I enjoyed a seven night stay at Castle Inn. We were treated very well, and the rooms are quite comfortable. We especially appreciated the free parking (hard to find in San Fran). The front desk was helpful, and directed us as to what parts of the city we should look at. Our son and his girlfriend also joined us and had a very good time. Great location, and no real noise issues. We will surely consider this hotel on a return trip, only slight complaint is that the remote controls for the televisions are outdated, and had to exchange 2 times before getting one that works., other than that small issue, great hotel!.

<Content>It Gets My Best Rating Trip Advisor reader comments is what convinced my wife  I to stay at THE CASTLE INN. I was skeptical of all of the great comments... thought they were too good to be true...but they were true. As soon as you walked out of the office after checking in, you just knew the hotel would live up to the reviews.IN A NUTSHELL, STAY HERE! It just doesn't get any better unless you want to drop a few hundred $ per night. We liked it so well, I am compelled to write this to help other first timers to San Francisco, as we were. My wife  both enjoyed everything...here are the highlights for you;HOTEL; clean, great value, on site parking so you can access your car easily, modest but sufficient breakfast...enough to get you out  on your way, clean sheets/towels daily of good quality, cleaned the bathroom daily (cleaned it, not just wipe off the counter) hotel is small'ish which makes it easy to get around.WiFi worked perfectly, even at the last room on the end where we were.STAFF; you'll be hard pressed to find any staff at ANY hotel that will give you the attention and GENUINE service of these folks...period. Hosts(not front desk clerks) Marshall  Arlene are good folks that make you feel at home. In early converstions with TCI before booking, I was confused about the word hosts that was being used...not anymore! The girls that cleaned the rooms were very nice too (and good at their jobs)My compliments to Varsa (owner?) on having such a great staff of hospitable people in such a large city. (any city for that matter)NEIGHBORHOOD; Just like it sounds, it's a neighborhood, it's safe, actually friendly/socialble, great variety of eateries. In this neighborhood, you felt as if you were part of the local rythems. We actually strolled the neighborhood one afternoon just to enjoy it. We came in late every evening, walking most of the time, without any problems. LOCATION; centrally located (meaning easy to drive to  from going any direction) great walking access to wharf, china town, 2 blocks to cable car, Lombard St., etc.SINCE YOU'VE READ THIS FAR, here's a tip for you...if you enjoy fine food in a small, but casual/sophisticated atmosphere, visit a restaurant on the corner of Hyde  Green (4 blocks from TCI on the cable car line) named FRASCATI. We stumbled on to it walking back from the wharf one night...it was one of those little discoveries you make accidentally that you'll talk about everytime you remember your trip to San Francisco. Hope this has helped you...enjoy THE CASTLE INN and San Francisco...we loved it!!

<Content>Good Room, Wonderful Staff, Amazing Value Stayed here for Labor Day weekend with my wife and 8 year old son. Arrived 2 hours before check-in and room was ready. The clean, basic hotel room had everything we needed. Beds were comfortable and sheets/towels were good quality. Noise from the outside was minimal. My only recomendation would be to update the bathroom. The fridge and microwave are great for snacks. The complementary breakfast with fruit, yogurt, muffins and juice saved us time and money. The central location is perfect - walking distance from many tourist destinations (Wharf, Chinatown), but the neighborhood away from the crowds made us feel like locals. Walgreens, Starbucks, market, and numerous restaurants from pizza to fine dining are within a few blocks.The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, giving us an overview of the area and the major attractions at check-in. We didn't have a car so the cheat sheet showing public transportation routes and transfers to 20+ areas and attractions was useful. Both restaurants they recommended (sushi and Italian) were excellent. The day before our departure, we gave them our flight information and while we were out they checked us into our flight and printed our boarding passes so we would get the A section for Southwest. They also let us check out 2+ hours late so we could get last minute sightseeing done without toting our bags around.For the bargain price the stay was extremely pleasant. We will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great location, very friendly We stayed for three nights in March. The people there were very friendly. I asked for a king size bed on the booking form and got the biggest bed I have ever seen in my life! Our room faced into the courtyard and was very quiet. The location is great. Feels very safe and is just a few blocks from the cable car and some nice cafes and restaurants. Apart from our obligatory tourist ride on the cable car we walked nearly everywhere - down to the wharf (where we hired bikes to go to Golden Gate Bridge), North Beach, Chinatown, Telegraph Hill, Union Square..... The staff were happy to advise us where not to walk through, and the hills were a good work out!I'd definitely recommend booking this motel.

<Content>Delightful 5 night stay Having found this hotel by reading other reviews on tripadvisor.com, we wanted to second the comments left by other travellers and add our own opinion.We stayed 5 nights at the Castle Inn. We are a family of three, two parents and one 12-year old child, staying in the area primarily for a trip in California that will take us to all the major league baseball stadiums. While in San Francisco we also wanted to see the major tourist attractions. The Castle Inn was the perfect locale for us.The Inn's location is superior, 1/2 block to a major bus line, 3 blocks to the busline that goes to AT  T park. We were able to walk to Fisherman's Wharf, Lombard Street and Chinatown. These walks are definitely for those in good physical condition. We were also able to go by bus to Golden Gate Park and Haight Ashbury. We chose to drive our rental car (parked FREE at the Castle Inn) to Muir Woods, Berkeley and Oakland (McAfee Stadium, for the A's game).Re: parking at the Castle Inn. Other reviewers have said that parking is tricky because the lot is small. Yes, but if you have a compact car or are a seasoned driver, you will have no difficulty. Do not let these comments deter you from staying here.Our room was very large (#229). Unable to secure a room with two beds, we booked a king room with a rollaway bed for our son. We had optimal room all around, plenty of room for our suitcases and belongings. We never felt cramped.Our room rate for our stay was $189/night + taxes. We felt this was a steal compared to the price of other hotels who would also charge for parking and wi-fi access (luxury hotels, when will they get a clue??). The room was very clean, sheets, towels and soap / cups refreshed daily.The breakfast included was nothing to speak of. Our son loved the cello-wrapped cinnamon rolls, but we prefered to pocket some cereal / granola bars for our day trips and get our breakfast from Peet's coffee and the Bagelry (just around the corner).Checkout is 11 a.m. You need to vacate your room prior to checkout -- apparently the owners had some difficulty with travellers using the telephone and incurring charges after checksing out.

<Content>A practical San Francisco gem What value for the location - just off Polk Street, close to Chinatown and Northbeach, and around the corner from Van Ness. This is a practical little hotel with free parking for guests, a lovely guest room with a comfortable bed, plush towels, granite and tile bathroom, coffee and amenities. Yet, this is a modest two-star hotel that gives you the basics without skimping. It's noisy outside with the cars and hustle bustle that make SF the great city that it is, but close the windows and you don't hear a thing. The front desk staff was warm, friendly, down home, and unpretentious. Wonderful neighborhood restaurants abound within walking distance, and the rate was gentle on our pocketbook. We will definitely return, as it is a good base for our SF touring.

<Content>Close to Central Arrived at 11.30pm by taxi after a tiring 12-hour flight and expected to be dealing with a dumb night -porter. Cheered up no end by Marshal's friendly briefing on what to see  where to go during vacation and for his advice during the 6 nights my wife  I stayed. The neighborhood is very safe and offers good food (American, Asian, Italian), bars, bookshops, Walgreens, and coffee shops. Buy a MUNI pass-- you can pick up a bus or cable car going almost anywhere in SF from a stop near the hotel. The room had all that was required and very quite. Light buffet breakfast in lobby or coffee shops nearby. Next time in San Francisco, this is the hotel for me.

<Content>A solid choice with very good location We stayed here for two nights at the end of our weeklong road trip along the Pacific Coast Highway starting in LA. The location is excellent. Parking is free (beware of what other hotels charge for this). Once we arrived, we parked the rental and didn't move it again until we left. This hotel is right near bus routes 47 and 49 and not that far from the starting point of the California Cable Car Line (California and Van Ness). If you ride the cable cars and buses a few times each in a given day, buy the all-you-can-ride day pass. Varsa (owner) was very helpful on the phone when I made the reservation. She wasn't there when we stayed, (would have liked to chat with her in person), but the husband and wife team working helped us with restaurants, maps, where to avoid, where best to catch the cable cars, etc. The room is decent size for the city. It was fairly quiet, and very clean. The elevator worked well. It was nice having a fridge since we were leaving early for the airport on our 2nd day. I'd recommend stocking up on food from the Real Food organic market just around the corner on Polk St (kinda pricey, but aren't most organic markets). Breakfast at this hotel was skimpy but I never expect much from continental breakfast. Good coffee could also be had around the corner on Polk at the Royal Ground, and 1/2 way decent bagels at the San Francisco Bagelry (Polk as well). The 20 something crowd would like the proximity of this hotel to the bars. Perhaps not as ideal for families with younger kids (no pool, no green space to run around), but this is an urban area after all.

<Content>Perfect place to stay! Found the hotel in the AAA book. Found the web site user friendly, and glad I booked Castle Inn. Best price in the area, free parking, and helpful office management. Good neighborhood, close to all. Our family of 4 were very comfortable. We drove everywhere, but there is public transportation nearby. Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>look no further My family of 6 (2 adults  4 children) stayed at the Castle Inn last week for 3 nights. We simply cannot fault this hotel in any way. Great location (good local restaurants and very close to public transport), extremely spacious, clean, and Varsa (the Manager) is a total gem - she was happy to help with any query or question we threw her way.Look no further for a fantastic hotel - you've just found it at the Castle Inn!

<Content>Awesome Choice My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Castle Inn. It's incredibly difficult to find a place that offers a reasonable price in a big city; the services and amenities offered by the Castle Inn make it the best deal going. Free parking and free wireless are two free offerings and the service is wonderful. Varsa is an incredibly friendly person who loves San Francisco. She willingly offers tips on restaurants, how to get around, and anything inbetween. The bed is comfortable enough, the t.v. worked well, the water pressure in the shower was excellent, and a refrigerator was a nice addition. I should note that we are the type to get up in the morning and hit the town. We don't spend an inordinate amount of time in the room. However, the price for this place, in close proximity to the Wharf and close enough to just about everything else, make it a great deal. We will stay at the Castle Inn again -- it's as good of a find as I've ever been fortunate enough to make in our travels.

<Content>Outstanding The best service I've ever had. The rooms are large (which is hard to find in San Francisco) and very clean. The room had a microwave, fridge, coffee maker, iron and board. When we arrived, we were given lots of info. on how to get around, maps of the area, city bus info., etc. We were treated like family by the owners, who were extemely helpful. There are good restaurants a grocery store, and a Walgreens within walking distance. The location is excellent for seeing San Francisco. I made the reservation directly at thier web site and got a nice e-mail from them. They requested flight arrival info, which I sent and told them, if possible to get an early check in, I'd greatly appreciate it since I am disabled and need to lie down often. I was told they couldn't promise, but would try. They were able to do so!!!! When we asked about printing boarding passes, they said they'd set a timer and do so for us...which they did...got us group A on Southwest. Couldn't have been happier with them. This is the only place I'd ever want to stay in San Francisco!!!!!

<Content>It was OKAY It was OK. It had free parking. I was afraid to park in the garage because the spaces were a bit small, but I managed. It seemed safe. The guy working the desk was an aging hippi, but it's San Francisco! Our room was walking distance from the cable stop and a block away from a doughnut shop. It's just up the hill from Fisherman's Warf, which I suggest you skip unless you're a glutton for punishment. But the seals! The room was clean and quiet. I have no real complaints. At the price we paid, I was afraid it would be a real dump. But it was, eh. OKAY!

<Content>Great hotel in San Francisco We chose to stay at the Castle Inn based on positive reviews we had read about the hotel and the friendly staff. We were not disappointed and wanted to reinforce all the positive comments about this inn. The staff is VERY friendly and helpful, especially Varsa, who booked several tours for us. The Inn is small with large rooms (for San Francisco standards) and very clean. Each morning there is a continental breakfast and a warm and friendly greeting from the staff with helpful information and advice on your planned activities for the day. The location is ideal within walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf, China Town and the North Beach area. Parking is free and rooms have a/c, which we actually had to use in June with unexpected warm days. I highly recommend the Castle Inn and will definitely book there on our next visit to San Francisco!

<Content>Perfect stay!! Marshall (Biker Dude) and Ms Arlene were the best! Had a great stay and would stay here again hands down. Close to everything, Marshall'sdirections were excellent, had a great self guided tour of the city.We did not rent a car and glad we didn't public trans. was fine buy a pass, you can even buy one for just a day. Escape from New York Pizza, I think it was on Polk, (it was across from the Walgreen's drug store), don't miss it. I understood when I booked this property that it wasn't a 5 star resort, none the less it was perfect for us and very clean. Next time I am in San Fran count me in for a stay at the Castel!

<Content>Good accommodation, helpful owners The Castle is situated in a convenient location for all San Franciscosights - not far from Fisherman's Warf and surrounded by many excellent restaurants and bars. The rooms are spacious and spotlesslyclean with very comfy beds.The owners are friendly, helpful, really know the area and are keen to help you enjoy your holiday by offeringsuggestions and advice. Included in the price is breakfast which consists of a good selection of muffins, pastries, fruit, juices, cereal bars etc. Excellent value for money.

<Content>Warning I decided to book this hotel after reading the reviews and I am not disappointed. It麓s all true. The hotel is very clean and well located. The staff is very friendly (Marshall and Varsa). But don麓t expect this friendship from everybody there. There is a woman that works in the front desk that was rude with me and my wife.

<Content>We recommend it If you are not a spoiled hoity-toity, the Castle Inn will serve you very well as a base for your SF trip. It is not fancy, but it is very clean and the price is right. The neighborhood is very safe and offers good food, bars, Walgreens, and coffee shops. Buy a MUNI pass-- you can pick up a bus or cable car going almost anywhere in SF from a stop near the hotel. Some of my family's best memories are from riding the bus; every ride we took offered great people-watching and yet it is completely safe.

<Content>No exagerations! Castle Inn, SF, is great! We selected Castle Inn based on positive reviews in Trip Advisor, and booked direct with hotel. The reviews are not exagerated! Great hotel, Marshall and Arlene, the managers, are great. Hotel rooms are clean, good beds, spacious. Their advice as to touring, eating, and travel was right on! We especially enjoyed the friendly neighborhood, including Shanghai Kelly's tavern on the corner, and all the really accommodating little restaurants within two blocks of hotel. A pass on the transit line got us everyplace in the city via cable, trolly and bus. Thank you, TripAdvisor and Castle Inn.

<Content>Great Place - Great Location! When we first arrived at the Castle Inn, parking the mini-van was a bit of a challenge. The hotel staff was more than helpful in finding a spot big enough to accomodate the size of the vehicle we had. They were exceptionally friendly and incredibly knowledgable with the area. It is in a great location, central to everything! I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Good place for the value The Castle Inn is a good place in a great location for the value. Visited there with my Mother recently and enjoyed our stay. Varsa at the front desk rules!! Very helpful, very nice. I do think the hotel needs some upgrading. There was porcelain chipped out of the tub, the caulk needed redone, the soap dish was rusty, and a fresh coat of paint would be nice. -- Little things that would not deter me from staying there again. The cleaning service was not too great. They left bedding in our room one day - not sure if it came from out bed or someone elses and the breakfast tray with morning leftovers tray wasn't removed one day. Overall, this hotel was still a great value for the location.

<Content>Fantastic Spot Arrived about midday to leave our bags, but were delighted to be informed that our room was ready for us. Very clean, extremely comfortable bed, and surprisingly quiet even though our room was right on the street. Handy to buses, cable car and 15 minute downhill walk to Fishermans Wharf. We were incredibly impressed with the quality for the price, and will definitely be back. Didn't have a car with us - but next time if we do decide to hire a car don't need to worry about hefty parking fees like downtown.

<Content>great reception staff It was our first night of the holiday, and we arrived to get a great welcome from the man on reception. He turned out to be the nicest one out of all the hotels we stayed in that holiday. There are limited parking spaces, but we had one of them. The room had typical boring decoration, but it did have everything we wanted - fridge, microwave, iron, coffee maker, hairdryer, large bathroom and ok comfy bed, and food in reception for breakfast. Its close to some great bars and restaurants, and over the road is a very useful supermarket. It was easy to get to other places in San Francisco, and easy to walk to Fishermans Wharf and Chinatown - but don't try walking up and down the hill in between, go around it! I would definitely go back again.

<Content>A Great Place to Stay in San Francisco After doing much research on the internet looking for a hotel to stay for our 3 nights in San Francisco that offered a good location, reasonable price, inclusive car parking and previous good reviews, we selected the Castle Inn as this seemed to tick all the boxes. After booking the rooms online I exchanged e-mails with Varsa who always replied promptly and conveyed a professional and curteous manner.On arrival we were given a warm welcome from the front desk staff and were not disappointed with our stay at the Castle Inn. Which proved an ideal location for getting around. With a good choice of restaurants round the corner on Polk Street, North Beach and China Town all within walking distance, as are Fishermans Wharf, Ghiradellis Square and the cable cars to downtown and Union Square.The hotel is kept extremely clean and tidy, the rooms are comfortable and a light breakfast is available from the main office each morning. The rooms have a fridge and microwave, so cool drinks can be kept on hand with chocolate from Ghiradellis...The staff are extremely helpful and obliging providing information on where to go, what to see and where not to go... and will arrange tours if required. We had already pre-arranged our tours via the internet.We hope to return to San Francisco and will not hesitate to stay again at the Castle Inn when we do.Its always nice to find a comfortable, clean and friendly hotel when visiting somewhere, especially for the first time. So keep up the good work and we hope to be back...

<Content>It's all you really need... First, what Castle Inn is not...Castle Inn is not the Ritz. Do not expect to be pampered or receive room service. However, if you want a decent hotel at a very reasonable price, then Castle Inn is the place. It's closer to a Red Roof Inn/Motel 6 but is WELL WORTH the price. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat and suggest it to anyone wanting to stay in SF.Pros: Great location in the interesting and safe neighborhood of Russian Hill, about 2 blocks from different 3 bus lines (get used to taking the bus...they're safe and convenient), about 1-2 blocks from restaurants and boutiques, not a lot of hills in this area, free parking (HUGE benefit), microwave and fridge in the room, clean, excellent service via internet liason (Varsa), helpful front office (Marshall), and the City tour we booked through Varsa and Tower Tours was well worth the price.Cons: Parking (although free) is a little tight...but so is the rest of San Francisco, our king bed was pretty uncomfortable...my shoulder hurt and my wife's back hurt after a couple of nights, we had some noisy neighbors above us one night around midnight and it took the front office a little while to respond to it. All in all, no major problems with Castle Inn. One negative thing to keep in mind about San Francisco: it is very expensive. Expect to pay $40-$50 for a tasty, but otherwise average meal. (I don't care what Zagat or other restaurant guides say...expect to pay more)Gas was $3.70/gallon. It won't be a cheap trip...but it is totally worth it.We had a great experience at Castle Inn. I shopped around quite a bit before booking my room and I honestly feel that this is the best value in the City. Other discount hotels charge anywhere from $10-30 a day for parking, so factor that in before choosing. Also other discount hotels that I looked at booking a room are in semi-rough neighborhoods. Castle Inn is in a very residential area (which I really enjoyed) but is just a 5 or 10 minute bus ride to almost anywhere in the city. Also, I really can't say enough nice things about Varsa (internet liason). She was very helpful and answered even the most mundane questions I had about the city. She's a real San Francisco ambassador. I give Castle Inn a 4 out of 5 and a hearty recommendation.

<Content>Great rate, great location and clean! This is a motel style inn in a great location. We were within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf and cable cars. The hotel is modest but clean. The fridge and microwave were nice for snacks and breakfast. The continental breakfast was simple but sufficient. The best part was the front desk staff. They gave us maps and recommendations that didn't disappoint. We would definitely stay here again. Can't beat that rate!

<Content>Just as Described! My teenaged daughter and I stayed here the last week in March. I had reseached quite a bit before booking, and we were very satisfied with the hotel. It was just as described on the website, maybe better! The rooms were extremely clean, it felt very safe, and it was close to so many things. We did not drive, so used public transportation every day. The bus system was easy to use, and the information sheet from the hotel proved very helpful. The complimentary pastries/fruit in the morning were a great way to start the day, and the staff was always friendly and helpful. We will definitely consider staying here again on our next trip to San Francisco. If you are looking for a clean, affordable, comfortable hotel (no frills--it's not the Hilton!) this is a great place to stay.

<Content>A great find My family decided to try the Castle inn March 16-20 after reading a review in a tour book and checking Trip Advisor and finding generallygreat reviews. We were very satisfied and were lucky to have Varsa onsight the entire time of our stay as she was genuinely friendly andinformative about how to see the sights in the city, where to buy themuni pass, etc. Many tourists near the wharf asked where I got the convienent, small map she provided and she also provided another one for my young son who loves to have his own copy. This is not a fancy place- furnishings were on par with Days Inn type chain but the rate was great for our family (as cheap as $99/night during the week if you book directly from their website) and included free parking and free continental breakfast which easily saved us $400 plus from the places I was looking at near the wharf area. We had room 225 which was midway back from street with rooms above and below and although we could hear street and other noise as we had the air conditioning off during our stay, it wasn't excessive nor did it intrude our sleep. You are in a city. My kids loved to go to the office to retrieve a tray of food in the morning and talk to Varsa (you have to eat in your room as the office isn't big enough to eat there) and we felt the place was safe enough to let them go off by themselves this distance. There are restaurants and Walgreens, etc. within a half block on Polk Street which was convienent but not intrusive. We got popcorn and drinks to store in fridge/microwave provided in each room. The beds were rather soft but it was very clean and the linens were better than average. Enjoyed staying away from the massesdown near the wharf but within 2 blocks of the cable car or a 20 min walk to this area. Walked around at night and never felt uneasy. Again, Varsa was very kind- provided postcard stamps and looked up an address for us on the internet and the hours of business for another attraction. We arrived rather late (after the posted office hours of 11pm) but had called a week ahead to confirm that we would be accomodated and also enroute and they waited up for us. It was a great choice for our first visit to SF and would have no qualms aboutstaying at the Castle again for this princess! Thank you trip advisorcontributors for this find!

<Content>Do not trust the Castle Inn The Castle Inn was terrible! I had booked through Expedia to stay here for a few days last April. Despite the fact that it was more or less a motel, I was initially swayed by all of the great reviews on this site.I had emailed the hotel a couple of days prior to my arrival to confirm everything which is usually what I do when I book through a 3rd party like Expedia or Orbitz. I was told everything was on target. To be noted, when I booked a few months prior through Expedia, I booked at an Expedia special rate which meant that my credit card was charged for the whole stay immedicately on booking.When we arrived at the Castle after a drive from Monterrey, we stopped at the office to check in and were greeted by a very unpleasant person. She was pleasant until I told her my name, and then her expression changed. It was as if she was hoping we were not showing up. At first she told us that they had no idea we were coming. When I showed her my paid in full confirmation from Expedia and the email from the hotel stating that they were expecting us, she then said that they were overbooked and could not accommodate us, even though our reservations were guaranteed and we were NOT a late arrival. Funny that she forgot about us but they didn't forget to collect the money from our booking months before. She then got on the phone and came back and told us that they would put us up at a sister hotel that was nice than theirs at no extra charge.Since we had never been to San Francisco and had no other options at this point, we went to the sister hotel (Francisco Bay Inn). It was terrible, did not have the same rating or accommodations as the Castle Inn, was located in a crappy, ghetto area and had loud truck noise constantly making it impossible to sleep. To top things off, it was dirty and I got stuck in their crappy elevator for 2 hours until they finally decided to call the elevator repair company. The cost for this hotel on Expedia when I checked was $50 less per night! I called Expedia to complain and they said the 2 hotels should be equivalent in accommodations so all they could do was give me a $50 coupon toward my next booking with them. I did call my credit card to file a complaint.Based on this, I would not trust the Castle Inn and their shady bait and switch system. I should have posted this review months ago but kind of forgot about trip advisor. The fact that I am this upset almost 1 year later should be warning to you!

<Content>Very Mean front desk lady The good things about this hotel: very clean, kona coffee, good location. Very nice internet lady, Varsa. I did not get to meet her in person, sadly, but she was very helpful and kind over the internet. She advised on buses, taxis, and shuttles to get to her hotel. The gentleman at the desk drew an excellent map for us and advised what to see and where to go and what areas to avoid. Very helpful.The one bad thing about this hotel: Arlene. Very rude. I told my friend not to sign the credit card receipt until I checked the price. Arlene said in a very mean way, I wouldn't cheat you ma'am. I never thought this...everyone makes mistakes, right? Anyone out there count their change at the store? She also said that shewouldn't be in business for very long if she did business that way.Well, guess what, she isn't the owner of the hotel anyway!The next morning I took one item from each breakfast basket. (This is their limit of what you can have according to Arlene.) I asked my husband if he was having anything and he said no. Arlene said,You're having enough for both of you. I told her I have a friend who takes longer to get ready, so I was going to offer her some of the treats (I returned the packaged items that my friend did not eat.) She proceeded to tell each of my friends that went down for breakfast that I had already gotten something for them. I had to ask her not to speak to me or my friends again. I have never had such poor or rude service in all my life. This is one miserable woman and I will never stay there again because of her. This is a shame becausethe other two at the hotel were awesome people. Plus everyone else we met in California were very nice people.

<Content>Nice place, nice price, good location We stayed at the Castle Inn in February after reading the reviews and we were not disappointed. We were 3 people in 2 rooms. Both were clean and big (specially for European standards), with TV, fridge, microwave and iron. The noise from the traffic did not bother us at all, although you could hear the cars passing by. We never made it to breakfast since it was very early but, as others said, there are plenty of places for that in Polk St. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The free parking was great. As for the location, we walked to Fisherman's Wharf easily (that's all downhill from the hotel) and even to Lombard St (but you have to literally climb up a hill for that!). The area is very nice and quiet. Someone complained in another review about the noise from the nightclubs and from the people in other rooms. We stayed at the Castle Inn 12 nights in total (9 when we arrived to the States and 3 before we left) using 4 different rooms and we never had any problems with any noise.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a budget place in a nice area.

I travel alot and do the booking for all our group(sometimes up to 10 people) This time there was 3 couples and from the time we checked it to the time we left 5 days later, I couldn't find one thing wrong with this place. Versa( the G.M.) is a rare find in this world were people just don't care about anything anymore. For a 2 star hotel it was the cleanest place I think I have ever been in. It may not be very fancy and or come with alot of frills, but the beds were great, the breakfast, fast and good for on the run and if you want to go anywere just ask Versa, she will tell you how, what, were, or were not to go! She was awsome! Plus the price is right for everyone. The hotel is just around the corner from the Walgreens and there are all kinds of restaurants and the Ed's Taco place was great. The added bonus, is its real close to the wharf and China Town. Thanks Versa for all your help and many kindnesses. (the cone, for parking, was such a surprise) Also the parking is free and the rooms come with wire-less internet. Linda from Phoenix

<Content>Doesn't get better at the price in SF Had an excellent three-night stay at the Castle in Feb. All the reviews are spot on - this place is great value. You're in a great SAFE location, close to everything you need and public transport almost at the door for further afield. Polk St is pretty funky and has a handy supermarket and the Real Food store is tops for healthy food options. Room was good - reasonable size, very clean and well serviced. Free wireless internet, tea/coffee, basic brekkie all thrown in! Great value given the great rates you can get booking direct.As for location, some reviews have been scathing, but I can't imagine why. Seemed very safe, even late at night, unlike Union Square/Market areas which get rapidly seedy as you stray from the most major shopping areas. Would recommend this location based on feeling safe and also how easy it is to get to everywhere else you might want to see in San Fran. US$18 3-day pass for MUNI is all you need to see it all, bargain.Hosts are friendly and the check-in blurb is worth paying attention to, these guys know their city and advise well.In summary, great value property in a good area of the city with welcoming and friendly hosts. Would recommend unreservedly for value-for-money in San Fran. (The hotel website should probably include a photo of the more motel-style accommodation at the back which forms a large part of this hotel though.)

<Content>Really liked the Castle Inn I recently spent 5 nights in SF at the Castle Inn and really enjoyed it. The staff was always helpful and responded quickly to any issues we had. The only issue we had during out stay was with the TV as we weren't able to watch HBO. We called the front desk and someone was in our room within 5 minutes to correct the problem.The rooms were niced size and had everything one might need - TV with HBO, refrigerator, microwave, table/chairs and air-conditioning. The rooms were also quite clean. The housekeeping staff did a great job, too. Some guests have mentioned the street noise. We never heard a thing, not even from other guests. This was a really quiet hotel. We had 2 adjoining rooms and wasn't even able to hear the other members of our party through the adjoining door. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Castle Inn My daughter and I enjoyed a wonderful week in San Francisco staying at the Castle Inn. It is situated in the Russian Hill area, very attractive and safe, and close to practically everything we wanted to see in the city. The incomparable Varsa at Reception was so helpful with information regarding everything from where to find a launderette, email facilities, shoe repairer, to a good Italian restaurant, and how to get a bus pass. I had sent several emails from Australia before the trip with various queries and requests and these were always dealt with promptly and cheerfully by Varsa. The website explains very clearly what to expect at the Castle Inn and we were not disappointed. Very pleasant room with an iron, fridge, microwave, full bathroom, everything very clean and comfortable. Book on the website to get the best rates and you will have very good accommodation in a lovely area at a great price. I would recommend it highly to other travellers.

<Content>Extremely good value for San Francisco We chose the Castle Inn due to its incredible value, more than anything as well as for its safe location. SF does not really have a lot of mid range hotels so you have to pay a lot for anything more upmarket. The location is fine ( very convenient to the Presidio, Golden Gate Bridge), and the free parking is also a big plus. The room was quite spacious, and extremely clean, although a bit dated in the decor ( but you have to keep reminding your self about the price!). The staff at the desk were very helpful and gave us good recommendations for dinner at a french bistro and a fish restauaunt around the corner and up the hill. Breakfast was so so but again it is just a bonus for the very small room price. My only real complaint was the noise level from the traffic, as the room fronts to an open walkway not directly onto the street but near enough. If you are a sound sleeper it should be ok, but otherwise if noise really bothers you then, this may not be for you.

<Content>What a lovely place As many others (I suspect), me and my girlfriend came across Castle Inn through the many great reviews on tripadvisor, and we were not disappointed.We stayed there for a total of seven days, and during that time we stayed in two seperate rooms. Both of them were in excellent condition, and, importantly, squeaky clean. You get free wireless internet (which, except for a minor glitches, worked flawlessly and fast compared to other (major) hotel networks I've tried), and you get many, many TV channels - if that means anything to you.The staff is as friendly as they get, and the location is marvellous. Lots of restaurants nearby (including the ones in Italian district), and a very relaxed, cosy atmosphere characterizes the neigborhood. It's a quite hilly area, so expect to use either bus or cable car, which both pass by in close approximity to the motel.If you want to do some major shopping (around Union Square, for example), you will probably want to use public transport. You could walk on a warm day, but don't overestimate your physical fitness when you're going back again ...Also, Castle Inn is very good value for money. We payed about $100 a night, and considering the large rooms, the service and the extras like wireless internet and TV selection, we can't complain.If you expect to get a proper breakfast, though, you should probably visit any of the nearby cafes or even Walgreens (for some decent sandwiches). The one in Castle Inn is a bit on the sugary side, but the coffee is great! :)

<Content>Okay As others have mentioned this is clearly a motel (on the order of Days inn or Super 8) and nothing more:Pros: clean, comfortable beds, off Polk with a great bagel shop and other nice shops and restaurants, easy 5 block walk to bus that takes you to Union Square in about 10 minutes, helpful hosts, priceCons: Air freshener in rooms -ewH! had to bust open windows after room was cleaned, too far and ugly to walk to Chinatown or North Beach (they suggest that you walk through this filthy long tunnel to get there and if you don't its longer (and just as un-scenic), super noisy!! walls are made of paper!, stomping people above us, loud car and nightclub noise outside, etc., etc.,continental breakfast served from 7:30-9am (never saw it - we're on vacation - who's getting up and out that early on the weekend??) I would recommend the place to anyone on a budget as you get a clean room for the money but I don't think I'd stay here again.

<Content>Good Location, Friendly Staff After reading encouraging reviews of this hotel on Trip Advisor we decided to give it a try - a good choice. Although the location isn't central, it is convenient for cable cars and buses and is within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf - hotel reception gave us details of transport links. Reception staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. An added bonus was the free parking. The room was spacious and clean although a little tired, perhaps some refurbishment would help. The bed was large and very comfortable. An adequate breakfast was included in the nightly rate. There were numerous shops and restaurants in the next street.Although close to busy roads and the Broadway Tunnel, we were never disturbed by traffic noise. I would recommend the Castle Inn to anyone wanting a decent hotel in San Francisco at a reasonable price.

<Content>A good find This is a very nice place. First impression might be that it's a little 'faded' but actually, it's fine - warm, clean, fairly quiet, not too far from things, good value and, above all, the most friendly and helpful staff you could wish to encounter anywhere. Nothing is too much trouble, you feel. We stayed at the start and end of a trip to California and each time, the different members of the desk team ensured I had a map, any other info I might need, and brought to my attention the areas they considered potentially unsafe (not nearby). Unwittingly, we went to collect breakfast a bit late - it had been put away, but they got stuff out for us, with no sense of inconvenience. And when a staff member saw us arrive quite late at night to find the car park full, he came out and moved his car so that we could have a space. I'd definitely stay there again on another trip

<Content>no point in staying here I fell for all the wonderful reviews as well, wrongly assuming the couple negative ones must have been flukes, but I won't make that mistake again. We tried to check out after the 1st night but would have been penalized with a stiff cancellation fee so we stayed, begrudgingly, knowing we'd be moving on to better shortly. (We were returning to San Francisco the following weekend and staying elsewhere). Helpful Hint: don't bother complaining to the clerk/reservationist, she has an answer for everything. What blew me away though, was with the information readily available on the Internet, why would you risk future business by keeping an unhappy customer? Smarter business would be to let them go so they could at least report that the situation was handled reasonably and satisfactorily. It was very annoying. We were told (with a smile) that we expect people to do their research 1st. So that's why I'm writing my 1st review ever, so the next family doesn't have to hear that line. Very frustrating for me as I'm a research freak, but the reservationist/desk clerk claimed it was a great place for toddlers, great location, easy to get around, etc. Definitely not true! Anyway, the location is depressing both inside and out. There is no convenient way to get around, unless you like standing in the rain waiting for buses and taxis, the latter of which are hard to come by. Not at all advisable with a toddler. The only thing it has going for it is free parking, but one doesn't need a car in the city anyway. Oh, and it's also very noisy at night. The walls are thin and the plumbing loud! Both inside and outside noise through the night. I brought earplugs but my husband didn't get much sleep.The bottom line is, there's just no point in staying here. There are so many options with better locations and similar prices, with lobbies, amenities and so much more. For what we paid in taxis we could have stayed in a 4 star hotel in a great location with everything in walking distance. Our friends stayed at the Marriott Parc 55 for half the price we were paying. It's just not worth the frustration.

<Content>Best Hotel Staff of Our 3-Week Trip After ho-hum service and attitudes experienced during our trip we couldn't believe how helpful the staff were (Marshall and Arlene) at the Castle Inn. For our 2-night stay the room was spacious, extremely clean and well maintained. We had a car (but didn't need it) and parking was secure and free. We didn't feel unsafe in the area. The hotel isn't in a no go zone. We walked down to Fisherman's Wharf and got the cable car back (don't recommend you do the reverse!). The hotel even got our money refunded for a tour we took that didn't work out as advertised. This we didn't expect. We would definitely stay at the Castle Inn again. We didn't have any problems whatsoever and everything we needed was provided.

<Content>Very good place to stay Ok this is not the ritz.The rooms are a very good size. The showers are good and in general it is certainly a comfortable place to stay. We stayed here for 4 nights and we had no problems at all. Location is very central with good restaurants nearby. Dont go to the wharf all the time for dinner - ask the guy at the front desk and he will recommend fine places to go which work out a lot cheaper than restaurants in the wharf.There is free breakfast here also - well coffee and fruit and pastries. We only found out this on the last morning we were leaving. But i have no problem in recommending this place for a vacation.

<Content>GREAT STAY We have just returned home to England from California and we stayed for 4 nights at the castle inn during that time. We choose it after reading reviews on this website and booked through Expedia. ( It is probably cheaper to book direct with hindsight). Its in a lovely position just below Nob Hill, around Russian Hill, on the corner of Van Ness and Broadway. The area is very safe and in Polk street, just over the road, there are a few nice restaurants, cafes and the inevitable Walgreens. If you like Chinese food, halfway down Polk Street on the left from the hotel, there is a little Chinese restaurant/take away, nothing posh, but the food was beautiful - fresh cooked to order and really reasonable priced - try the plum wine at $2.50 per glass. Its called Andy's.Back to Castle Inn - lots of good free parking, pleasant hosts, very comfortable, clean rooms with the usual facilities. Comfortable beds with pastel shade bedlinen. Coffee/tea available all day in the small reception, plus there is a coffee maker in room. There is a complimentary continental breakfast - fruit, muffins, danish, etc. which you take up to your room on a tray.All in all, would definitely stay there again. We bought a 3 day pass that we could use on street cars, trams, buses and metro for just $18 each. (its $5 for just one journey on a street car), and we really had our value over 3 days.

<Content>Great value for money We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The reviews on this site are spot on and this motel offers great facilities, clean rooms and a great location in a nice neighbourhood. All the main tourist sites are 15 minutes walk away. We found a great Japanese restaurant called Wasabi and Ginger on Van Ness Avenue just 3 mins walk away - highly recommended. We will be back!

<Content>great experience -- this is the place to stay! I stayed at the Castle Inn while at a conference this past July. Like many of you, I spent a lot of time looking for affordable places to stay in SF that were in a decent neighborhood and accessible to most attractions. I decided to go with the Castle Inn and was glad I did. The rooms are clean and basic, but had everything that I needed. The free parking was a huge plus, and there are interesting shops and restaurants within walking distance. The staff were also very friendly. Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until 2am. We had given the front desk a heads up and it was no problem at all.

<Content>Great value - Great location Trip Advisor led us to this hotel and we were very pleased with the 'recommendation'. This is a no frills place to stay but the staff are very friendly and the location is great.Fisherman's Wharf is within easy walking distance as are the bus and tram routes that can take you all over SF. The hotel is situated in a bohemian part of town with lots of relaxed restaurants and coffee shops just round the corner. The area felt very safe. Staff were very helpful and helped to map out all the places to go - and not go! Their advice was valuable. The rooms were clean and adequate - we didnt spend much time in them...remember there are no 'communal' type hotel facilities.The Castle Inn is a great option for travellers who dont mind being slightly out of town but need to be somewhere safe within shooting distance of the attractions. We would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Castle Inn My husband and I stayed at the Castle Inn for 3 nights . We were delighted to find a reasonably priced hotel that met all our needs. The room was well furnished and clean. The blue sheets were a nice touch. The proprietor grew up in this neighborhood and was able to guide us and answer all our questions. We have stayed in several different neighborhoods in San Francisco and found this area to be the best. Polk Street which is just around the corner has a multitude of amenities including restaurants, bars, bagel shops, coffee shops, etc. etc. We hope to stay here again!!

<Content>What a great Holiday I can't believe that I wrote a review back in March 2006 after we returned and it didn't take. What a great spot. It sort of was like getting to stay in your Great Aunt's apartment for a week. We had a suite which was huge with two bedrooms, storage room with fridge and microwave. Great location. We didn't meet the incredible Varsa but Marshall and his wife were cool hosts. We really enjoyed our time there. Convenient to everything. My husband commented that this was a really neat and different vacation. The room was so comfortable and the location so great. Bravo.

<Content>Great Location We recently stayed at the Castle Inn for 2 weeks and were very satisfied. The staff were very helpful whenever we asked for any information and Marshall kindly arranged help in renting a car for a couple of days to go down to Monterey. We were very happy with the cleanliness of the Inn, towels changed every day, and all the facilities were more than adequate for our requirements. The little fridge was very handy to store beer or wine and kept things nice and cool and it was great to have a decent sized ironing board and a good iron and the location was super for pubs, restaurants, nearby coin laundry, internet cafe round the corner etc. We would definitely stay there again. The only thing it lacks is a common place where guests could meet up to chat as we met some nice people but just had to chat on the verandah. All in all, a very enjoyable stay.

<Content>Great for Budget Travelers We stayed here for a few nights during our honeymoon. For people looking for true luxury, obviously look elsewhere. But for us, it was PERFECT. We are not afraid of a little walking and loved the central location. The room was clean and spacious and we never had a noise problem.The staff was very helpful, gave us a map and pointed out the major attractions, as well as advice on which places to steer clear of. We honestly really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone who wants to experience San Francisco for the first time and has no need for flashy accomodations. When we go back to San Fran, I will be sure to stay there again.

<Content>Excellent Service and Location We stayed at the Castle Inn mainly because of the great reviews and were not disappointed. The best selling feature of the property is the service, Varsa is wonderful! We asked so many questions and she was always smiling, helpful and the best! The motel is also located in a great area of town, it felt more like being in a neighbourhood, we felt safe and secure and didn't worry about our car at all. We walked everywhere from the hotel, down to Fisherman's Wharf, Little Italy, Coit Tower etc and found it really accessible. If unable to walk alot, the Trolley Car line is only 2 large blocks away and we advise getting the 2 or 3 day pass for this.The Inn itself is basic, but for the price we paid was worth it. The rooms are clean and spacious however the bathroom was small , they do need to be redone. The paint on the tub was peeling, and could use a new tub insert to spruce it up.The Continental breakfast met our needs as we aren't big breakfast people. There is packaged muffins and treats and lots of coffee, OJ and hot chocolate.We would definately stay here again and recommend it to anyone! The service is what sells this place, Varsa really made us feel welcome and was extremely helpful.

<Content>Not Bad Not bad...The room was clean and spacious. The staff was friendly and helpful. As for the walking distance, it is a good walk (close to a mile) to Fisherman鈥檚 Warf and Chinatown. We had no problems however if your not a person in reasonable shape forget it. Remember San Francisco is ALL hills. Cable Cars are close by but, they cost $5 per person per ride.I never saw indication for the wine and houer d overs, and can't imagine where they would have them it was pretty small lobby. There was coffee available when the lobby was open. If you are looking for a clean place to stay for a good price this is a great place.

<Content>Great Place, Great Neighborhood I think the Castle Inn is a very clean and well run hotel. It's not a Sheraton or a Hilton by all means, but the rooms are clean and the surrounding neighborhood is safe enough to walk at any time of the day. Marshall was an excellent host who gave us the DL (down low) on the best areas of San Francisco. The free parking was a plus because parking in the city is a big hassle. Leave your car in the garage and take public transportation. I also suggest that you explore the surrounding neighborhood especially along Polk Street. There's an excellent wine store (William Cross), a great cheese store, a great coffee shop (Peets) and the best sports bar/pub in SF (Green's). It was an easy walk to the wharf without too many steep hills, as a matter of fact, we could never get a cab at the wharf and had to walk back late at night several times with no problems, heck after all the food we ate we needed the exercise anyway. All in all the Castle Inn is the best hotel you'll find in the city for the money and safety. Thanks for having us!

<Content>A good choice in San Francisco Arriving in your room at the Castle Inn you might find yourself a little disappointed. The room is modestly sized, and the chances are you'll have a view of the walkway connecting the rooms which overlook the courtyard (car park). However, this place has plenty of good things going for it and proved to be an excellent option for our stay in San Francisco.The greeting was fantastic. After being given the keys to our room we were invited back to reception where the receptionist provided us with books and maps of the city, along with superb advice as to where to go and what to see.Although a little small, the room was spotless and very well decorated. The shower head had a number of interesting settings, including the pulse massage which was well appreciated after being enveloped in the cold SF fog. The 'kitchen' area was a little odd, comprising a microwave, coffee maker and fridge, but little in the way of utensils. This isn't a complaint as the facilities were well appreciated, rather it's an observation.The Inn stands just off highway 101, which meant that it was easy for me as a tourist to find, and to get back on to to reach the airport on the final day of my stay.A short walk around the corner on to Polk Street finds you among a good range of good quality coffee shops, bars and restaurants, as well as an organic market and chilled food takeaway which did a fantastic won ton salad. There is little other accomodation in this area so it feels like you are living among the locals. Unfortunately we weren't told about the free breakfast, but I think this was our gain as we found a fantastic 'boulangerie' nearby selling a delicious range of pastries and fantastic coffee.Although this hotel isn't in the middle of the tourist hustle, it is only a fifteen minute walk from Fisherman's Wharf. If you want to stay somewhere residential, away from the tourists, but on the doorstep of the sights, then as long as you keep your expectations realistic the Castle Inn shouldn't disappoint.

<Content>nothing special Stayed at this hotel for five nights, although it is more of a motel with no facilities other than the rooms and a small office, although free parking is provided.The room was on the small side with a small bathroom attached,although clean it was dated.the hotel is quite handy for the attractions but you will need to be fit as it is quite a climb from the wharf area, the hotel was also in a noisy area with traffic noise late at night.

<Content>Great location and friendly staff The Castle Inn is in a great location for anyone wanting to be within walking distance of many SF attractions as well in a better part of town. It is close to the 101 highway as well for anyone that wants to head up to the GG bridge. Yes the rooms are older and it isn't a Hilton caliber stay, but the price for the quality and location is great. We were stuck with a minivan from our rental car company which made it very difficult to fit into the tighly packed parking garage so I would recommend only having a compact or midsize car if you are staying here unless you are an experience inner city parker/driver. The front windows offered some great people watching and the courtyard accross the street is serene. If you are looking for a quiet hotel at night room or one that is fancy, look elsewhere. Otherwise stay here...

<Content>Do not Stay at this Hotel Its a Dump! I would agree with previous contributions. This is hotel is not really a hotel but rather a run down MOTEL which you would expect to find in a very poor part of town.It is being dishonest to say it is a hotel. The room we were allocated was dingy, shabby and poorly decorated and depressing. I found the staff to be surly and unhelpful. The so called advertised breakfast is so poor as to be laughable. Nura-grain bars with a few pieces of fruit and yogurts.The pictures on the website are deceiving and deceitful do not reflect the true nature of this MOTEL. It is vastly overpriced for what it is in reality. If it was half the price it is now, it would still be overpriced.If you value your time in San Francisco, do yourself and your relatives a favour and find somewhere else. SignedA now wary traveler who was deceived by the hotel.

<Content>Real bargain find!!!! We got we paid for and more!!!! We stayed here for 2 nights in April 2006. We informed the staff in advance that our flight would not be landing until 9pm so we would be late booking in. When we did arrive, we had been saved a parking space as promised and check-in staff were great with two bleary eyed UK travellers who had been on the go for nearly 24hrs!!! We'd heard stories of all food places stopping serving food at 9pm, but we were soon directed to a nearby pub with great food and drink by helpful staff!!Rooms were quite a big size and very very clean. We had no problems with the showers and bathroom area - yes we'd agree that the bathroom area was slightly aged but it was immaculately clean.As Brits we found it a bit weird having a fridge in the bathroom area though!!!Breakfast was exactly as described, so we knew what to expect and were not disappointed with the Danish, cereal bars, muffins etc. We thought it was a very American breakfast!!We enjoy walking around towns and cities and find that this is the best way to explore so we had no problems with the location - remember that there are hills everywhere in San Francisco no matter where you stay!!!We got more than we paid for - great location and clean and big-sized room and free car parking.

<Content>Charming Family of four, 2 adults 2 children ages 16 and 12 stayed at this property 2 nights in August. Booked directley with property after reading excellent reviews on this site. Our stay was great. The room met all of our needs. It was clean and comfortable. At check in we were welcomed and given all sorts of great and useful information about everything we needed to know about sightseeing in San Francisco. There was a light breakfast provided in the main office but we did not take that in. The area was safe and we loved the atmosphere. Free parking was provided which was such a bonus. Even before we arrived I emailed the property asking all kinds of questions and the replies were quick and informative. All in all I recommend this property as a 2 thumbs up!!!

<Content>Basic Good Value Inn Castle Inn was as previously described - a modest inn, conveniently located and good value. Check in was a breeze, breakfast was continental (didnt want to fill up too much anyway so we could enjoy the various local food) and the location was just a short walk to the cable or bus lines. No, the view from the room is not anything special, but who cares? We were out at all hours and were in the room mainly just to sleep and clean up. Free parking was a big selling point! Would suggest SF visitors purchase muni passes as the cable cars are expensive and the public transit can take you anywhere. Only suggestions for management would be real milk for morning coffee.

<Content>It's ok When we arrived I was a bit disappointed, not sure what I was expecting but all the rooms face down into a courtyard. Someone else described it more motor inn than motel/hotel  I would have to agree. Obvious plus, they don't charge extra for parking your car there like many other hotels. The staff is extremely friendly, well informed  more than willing to help you anyway they can. The room was very clean and roomy except for the bathroom area. The bathroom is the size of a closet and I'm not a big person  nowhere to put anything once inside. The sink is outside but not much room there either. It's a solid 15 min. walk downhill to the Wharf  that's the beginning of the Wharf, it will take you another 10 mins. to walk, let's say to the pier for Alcatraz - it's pretty much all uphill back - best to take the bus or trolly - both leave you near the hotel. I'd skip the continental breakfast, nothing special, some fruit, no fresh muffins - packaged stuff - would have been nice to have some real milk or cream for coffee/tea as opposed to powdered. The price was right for what you get.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff We stayed at the Castle Inn for 5 nights and found the place to be exactly as others had described. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the location was great for exploring the city. Room was comfortable and the breakfast although only light was really convenient. My only slight criticism is that we found the shower difficult to operate but otherwise our stay was great.My tip for other visitors using taxis is make sure that you know the cross street for your destination. The SF taxi drivers don't have the same knowledge as London cabbies. The 2 we used didn't know where the Castle Inn was and even had trouble finding Broadway.

<Content>Great Stay Absolutely fab place to stay, so convenient to all that is going on, staff were very helpful with map and directions and a great plus is secure parking. the people in San Francisco were the best, so friendly here. We only stayed 2 nights but would like to stay a week next time. Weather abit cool even for us Brits but go to other side of bridge and its fabulous.We cycled over Golden Gate bridge (about 8 miles), then got ferry back. And u must try clam chowder soup and the fish restaurants on Fishermans Wharf. All in all a fantastic city.Would certainly recommended hotel to all my friends.

<Content>Good Bet Clean, good size rooms. Great desk staff (not sure if they were the owners) We did not have a car so it was a walking challenge...as another has observed, it is not as central as it is made out to be, but close to the bus line which was easy to use. Walked to Chinatown from here (under the highway tunnel) Close to a lot of great inexpensive neighborhood restaurants. All in all it was excellent value.

<Content>Lives Up To Its Reputation We chose Castle Inn for our three night stay in San Francisco based on the excellent reviews on tripadvisor.com. I am happy to report that the positive reviews are right on the money. We actually arrived two hours prior to check in time and were given a room right away. We stayed in #339, which is the last room on the top floor. Very quiet since no other guests walk by the room. Parking was always available. Check in and out went extremely smoothly. Owners and staff were knowledgeable and very friendly. Our room was basic, similar to La Quinta, but was very clean and had everything we needed. The location was ideal for visiting all the tourist spots, and there is a Starbucks right around the corner on Polk. We rode the cable car/bus one day and drove the next day. We much preferred having our car and did not have difficulty finding parking. We paid about the same for two all day bus passes as we did for parking the next day. We highly recommend Castle Inn! The total cost was approximately half of staying at the better known chains.

<Content>Great Value in San Fran Agree heartily with many of the other reviewers of the Castle. It's a great value spot in San Francisco. Not fancy but clean, comfortable beds, free parking, well located and good service by the owners.Please ask the proprietors for restaurant advice. We ate at three of their recommendations (Chinese, Mexican and burgers) in the neighborhood and had great food at very reasonable prices. Much better quality and value than the places down by the Wharf.Strongly recommend buying the public transportation pass. We did the three day pass and you can use the trains, buses or cable cars. Saves alot of time and energy instead of battling SF's famous hills. And don't wait in the often long lines at the beginning of the cable car routes. Walk up a stop and grab a spot - they don't fill the cars to capacity at the origin.

<Content>Great Place for A Great Price My wife and I planned our first trip to San Francisco and Napa valley and used TripAdvisor as one of our main research tools. We opted to stay at the Castle Inn after reading numerous reviews and checking out prices. All I can say is that our visit lived up to our expectations. The Castle Inn was clean and centrally located to many of the attractions we were interested in visiting. While researching places to stay, I was impressed with the prior reviews of this location as well as the fact that the GM personally responded to one of the only negative reviews posted. When we checked in, I was pleased with the exceptional 'customer service' we received. Without inquiry, we were provided with everything we could possibly need to navigate the city. We received a map of the city, local bus and trolley routes as well as first hand advice on which roads to take and places of interest. This type of service was routine during our visit. Interestingly enough, on one of the days we were visiting, the hotel management was replacing the room furniture. Let me tell you, it was a recipe for disaster when you consider that a large moving truck had to be parked in front of the hotel and the movers needed to complete this task in a three level hotel without disturbing guests. Personally, I was pleased with how the process went. The night before the move, the GM called us to advise what was going to happen and what we should expect. Although the movers were later than expected, I was completely satisfied with the manner in which our furniture swap was handled. The pictures currently available on this site appear to have the older furniture. The new furniture is much lighter in color.A few other notable benefits of this location include free parking (which is very impressive when you look at other hotels), an abundance of restaurants nearby and the ability to walk to locations such as the Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, Coit Tower, Lombard St, and Union Square. Please note that I indicated the ability to walk to these locations. A few are a good 2 mile + walk so please take that into consideration. If you are thinking about staying at the Castle Inn, please be aware this isn't similar to a Marriott or a Sheraton. It isn't nearly as plush. If you are the type of traveler that is looking for a reasonable place to stay where you can ask the hotel staff for advice or suggestions, then the Castle Inn is likely for you. I really felt like they took an interest in my stay and wanted repeat business.

<Content>Terrific hotel for families We stayed at The Castle for three nights in mid-June (two parents, one 6-year-old, one 12-year-old). Like other reviewers, I certainly agree that the hotel was above average in cleanliness (I recently stayed at a 5 star hotel in Atlanta and The Castle's rooms were cleaner), there was ample parking and the location is perfect when you're not driving. We were able to catch the bus at a stop that was a minute away, there were two coffee houses and a bagel shop around the corner and lots of local flavor.But what impressed me the most was the people who worked at the Castle Inn. Our flight from Houston was delayed by three hours so when we got to the Castle, we had 30 minutes to check in and make it to our Alcatraz tour -- Varsa immediately worked with me to check us in while another Castle employee (I'm sorry that I didn't catch his name) explained to my husband how to get to the tour and answered all his questions. Throughout our stay, Varsa was always willing to answer our questions -- she gave us lots of directions, recommended local restaurants and always had a smile on her face. When we asked about a place she hadn't visited, she asked us about it when we got back not only because she said she'd always thought of visiting but so she'd have information if a future guest asked. Clean, comfortable rooms, great prices and extraordinarly friendly staff make the Castle Inn a gem of a hotel. I've already recommended the Castle Inn to a friend and we certainly will stay here again!

<Content>Honeymoon Highlight We arrived late on Tuesday June 20th and stayed 3 nights at the beginning of our 8 night, 7 day honeymoon to San Francisco and Sonoma Valley. Sy met us at about midnight and immediately began providing extremely useful information. Varsa was just as helpful the next day. They provided us with a cheat sheet of directions to all the key tourist sites and provided us with excellent restaurant recommendations within the area that were not tourist traps. We tried 3 of them and were very pleased. Tai Chi (Polk and Broadway) was a Hunan Mandarin restaurant that was out of this world. Hyde Street Seafood House was incredible for (wait for it -) seafood. Street on Polk has wonderful ambience. $2 Happy Hour (Thursdays and Fridays 5 to 9 p.m.) at Rouge (Polk and Broadway) was great too. The Polk Street/Russian Hill area is an incredible district. Castle Inn is right in the middle of it and within walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf, Lombard Street (the Crooked Street), Nob Hill and North Beach.The hotel is great value for money. The room was one of the cleanest we have ever stayed in and was very quiet (we were near the back of the hotel). We greatly appreciated the amazing personal concierge service from Sy and Varsa! We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved this place! I recently traveled to SF and stayed at the Castle Inn for 5 nights. The owners, Varsa and Sy, were very friendly and helped with ideas and directions. The rooms were very nice...a good room for the price! I also found the rooms to be very clean and quiet...my room was towards the rear of the hotel, so I am sure that it helped keep the noise level down. Parking was never a problem and a great bargin....it was free! If your plans don't take you out of SF, you really wouldn't need to rent a car. The Castle Inn is located in the perfect spot. Easy walk to the wharf, chinatown, north beach...union square was a bit farther, but still a nice walk. There are many restaurants located on Polk Street. On my next visit to SF, I will be staying at the Castle Inn!

<Content>Good place for those on a budget I just got back from my round-the-world holiday so I thought I'd submit a review on the Castle Inn. I stayed there in April with my girlfriend.On arrival it's one of those places where you're thinking oh dear, what did I book?However once settled you see this hotel for what it's worth.First the positives:* The rooms are quite large. We had a double bed and there was a desk, television, wardrobe and bedside tables.* The shower was fantastic, if a little confusing to figure out the first time. Plenty of water pressure and hot water. * Marshall in the front desk was really helpful with directions and telling us where to go in San Fran. He also drew an area on the map and told us not to go there (Tenderloin). The only downside was he was suffering from an ear infection when we were there so he was a bit grumpy.* The location is fantastic, especially for budget travellers who need facilities like laundromats and internet (both are within a two minute walk of the hotel). Marshall also gives you a sheet explaining all the main attractions and how to access them via bus/tram. This piece of paper was my bible for the week. What a great idea!There were a couple of negatives:* Our room was facing the street and it can get a bit noisy in the early hours. I kept getting woken up by drunk guys stumbling home.* Also, we came back to our room at around midday one day to find a couple of workmen in our room changing the blinds. We weren't warned that this was going to happen so we were a bit disappointed (especially since we weren't gone long so we left our valuables there). Let me stress that nothing went missing though, and the workmen were very apologetic for their intrusion.Still, I'd recommend this hotel. It can be a bit daunting when selecting a hotel in San Francisco, particularly with all the hullaballoo about the dangers of the Tenderloin. If you in any way concerned about that, stay here. It's a nice part of town with nice eateries within five minutes walk.

The Inn has ample local dining options close by, is within yards of the bus system, and is 4 blocks downhill from the cable car. Marshall and Arlene were very helpful with directions and maps. We鈥檇 definitely stay here again. Kudos from your Idaho guests!

<Content>Great Hotel, great Service and close to Fisherman's Wharf This is a clean and very comfortable hotel with FREE PARKING! We stayed there for three nights and had two different rooms (we didn't have reservations, but we only had to change rooms once) and they were clean. Each room had a nice, big king sized bed, and the bed sheets and bedspreads were (and smelled!) clean. All the rooms have pretty good sized mini-refrigerator. Also, each room has a small microwave, coffee machine and hair dryer.The host, Marshall, is a burly man in his 50's with a ZZ Top beard. He may seem daunting at first, but he is a wonderful host and very attentive to his guests needs. He told us where to go, how to get there and where not to go in SF.Castle Inn has Continental Breakfast every morning which consists of packaged muffins, some cereals, fruits, and instant coffee, instant hot chocolate, tea, and fruit bars. I guess for the price, that's pretty good.My husband and I would definitely stay here again. The hotel is close to Fisherman's Wharf (via the cable car trolley) and did I mention they have free parking?

<Content>Loved the Castle Inn We had a wonderful visit to San Francisco thanks to Varsa at the Castle Inn. She not only helped us with planning our sight seeing itinerary but also took care of all of our bookings. Her vibrant personality, coupled with the great location of this hotel, made our stay an enjoyable one. If you are planning a trip to San Francisco, the Castle Inn is definitely the place to stay.

<Content>Aussies recommend Castle Inn and area great value Stayed 4 nights at the beginning of our holiday, luggage was stored whilst we did a trip to Yosemite and then back for another 3 nights. Marshall and Arlene do a wonderful job. The area is great, transport via the Muni system is so easy and Polk Street was a great eating area. Walking to fishermans Wharf is quite easy as well as it is DOWNHILL. Supplied us with a transport guide to main attractions/ bus numbers as well as various recommendations. Fresh fruit, yoghurt some muffins can be chosen for breakfast Microwave coffee maker and fridge was very useful. Rooms very very clean building recently painted. Congratulations and thanks.

<Content>another good review as per other guests who have enjoyed their stay at the castle, we did too.room on the third floor was very clean and well maintaied. my wife is very particular about beds and clean sheets. and these were immaculate, even though marshall told us they were having problems with the laundry.located in a nice and safe neighbourhood, a twenty minute walk from the wharf and its attractions.the price is very good for what you get, free parking $$$$ everywhere else. after not visiting s/f for 5 years we found the prices have gone up a great deal, and the service industry see the tourist as a cash machine, but not the CASTLE, thank you for a great time.

<Content>Ideal place tp stay Stayed at the Castle Inn as part of a holiday touring the Pacific Coast and found it ideal for our purpose. Great location, good facilities and helpful staff - the advice that HW1 was closed as far as Santa Cruz due to land slips was especially valuable; we were about to head in that direction! I would recomend this hotel to anyone who is looking to explore SF and keep to reasonable budget.

<Content>Fantastic value We arrived an stayed at the Castle Inn in San Francisco for two nights and were surprised by the overall value. The local ownership indubitably shines through in the comfort and care demonstrated for through travelers and guests. The rooms are spacious and recently renovated. The maid service is appropriately timely and unintrusive. Highly recommended!

<Content>Loved the Castle Inn - best value and comfort This hotel is an amazing value. The cost of the rooms for its location and size is phenomenal. The owner is a joy to meet and the space could not be a better value. I normally stay in either luxurious high end hotels or hostels on cheaper vacations, and this did an amazing job of blending both (luxury / comfort and value).

<Content>Great place to stay for a great price! My husband and I stayed at the Castle Inn from May 6-12, 2006, and had a great stay. The Castle is located near everything or at least near transportation to get to where we wanted to go. Marshall and Arlene couldn't have been more helpful with our questions on where to go, how to get there, providing maps, guidance, etc. The room wasn't a Marriott..but we didn't expect it to be for the money.. it was a clean, well kept hotel. We would definitely stay there again and/or tell our friends about this place. It is definitely a jewel in the city.

<Content>Great stay!! We stayed here in April with our 2 older kids and would really recommend it. We stayed 3 nights in a family suite (don't know if they have more than one) and booked directly with the hotel. Varsa was so helpful when we arrived and supplied us with maps and recommended restaurants and shopping areas to us. The accomodation was very clean and consisted of a large living room with double bed, sofas  TV and off there was a short corridor with another double bedroom (with TV) a bathroom, plus a large walk in closet with fridge, microwave and coffee maker ( there were no proper cooking facilities though). The main bedroom/living room faced the street but we weren't bothered by the traffic noise and the other bedroom faced onto the external walkway/courtyard and was much quieter. There was a basic continental breakfast available until around 9am from the front office that you could take back to your room on a tray but lots of very good restaurants were available within a few minutes walk of the hotel. Everything was within 30 minutes walking distance (Wharf, Union square, China town) but we usually used public transport to get us back. We weren't in the room that much (too much to see and do in SF!) but when we were, there was enough space for all of us and would stay there again.

<Content>Kind Staff, Incredible location, free parking A friend and I stayed at the Castle in for 2 nights. We had excellent service from the staff extremely kind and helpful. They let us into our room early, gave us very helpful directions, suggestions and maps for walking, bus information etc. The room was very clean and quiet. Free parking was a huge plus! The location is great.I would stay there again and highly recommend the Castle Inn.

<Content>Awesome customer service Can't express how impressed we were with our stay... the two people who run this hotel are extremely nice and helpful. The hotel itself is clean and in a GREAT neighborhood. Very safe, family-friendly and quiet. I highly recommend this hotel as a very nice low-budget find for those that don't need all the glitz of a higher star hotel (which you shouldn't need anyways since San Francisco offers more than enough to keep you occupied).

<Content>Great stay - real value for your money ! Stayed at the Castle Inn late April, early May and it was just great. The area is great, quiet, lots of restaurants etc, compared to Union Square where we have stayed previously, it's really nice place (don't get me wrong, Union Square is nice place for shopping but I think that we won't be staying there in the future).And the Inn itself, well, it is a motel, but a good one, rooms are kept very, very clean.And the staff, very helpful indeed ! When we arrived, Varsa was there, gave us a map and pointed places to go, places not to go etc. And Arlene and Marshall, just as great, always ready to answer to our question, even to stupid ones :) Breakfast was basic, but just enough to get you going. Our family would definately stay here again !

<Content>Loved the Castle Inn The Castle Inn is a great place to stay in San Francisco. We spent a couple of nights at the Castle Inn on a recent trip to the San Francisco area. The hosts, Arlene and Marshall were very pleasant and helpful. Our flight arrived extremely late and we did not get to the hotel until long after the front desk normally would have closed. Marshall waited up for us, and we were in bed within minutes of arriving. We had a room with 2 double beds, a separate wash and bath area. Coffeee maker, hair dryer,and small refrigerator. The room was clean and comfortable. A good value compared to some of the more pricey hotels in town. The hotel offers a continental breakfast in the small lobby. They offer free parking, which is a huge advantage in the city. The location is great. It is in a safe part of town, and a shorrt walk to the cable car that will take you to Fisherman's Warf. There is a fabulous little Thia resteraunt a block from the hotel.The rooftop of the hotel offers a neat view of the city, and the Golden Gate Bridge. We would definitely would stay here again. Thanks to Arlene and Marshall.

<Content>Perfect for our vacation I am a picky traveler and I usually stick to big hotel chains that I know and that are cookie cutter consistent. I was a little leery about choosing the Castle Inn for our brief (3 and 1/2 day) trip, but I was put off by the prices of the big chains in Fishermans Wharf (and by the big parking fees, since we'd be bringing a car for the non-San Francisco part of our trip).I am pleased to say that the Castle Inn is as good as reported by prevous Trip Advisor reviewers. I NEVER would have chosen it from it's appearance on the street (I am a little of a hotel snob and I really like a showy marble foyer). Not choosing this hotel would be a mistake, however. The foyer/office is tiny but is filled with the gracious presence of Marshall and Arlene. We arrived 5 hours prior to check-in time but it was no problem to leave our car in the very safe and covered parking area while we went out and started to explore the city. Marshall spent a good 15 minutes with us going over a map with many suggestions for San Francisco first-timers, including how to get around on the public transportation. The hotel (?motel) was about a 2-3 block walk to the cable car route.Our room was not fancy-fancy, but very clean and perfect for our family of 2 adults and 2 teens. There was no view, but we were going to San Fran to get out and see the views ourselves, not sit in a hotel and look out the window.The breakfast was tiny, but got us going - basically packaged muffins, danish, granola bars, fruit, coffee and juice.I/we would definitely come here again. I thank the Trip Advisor reviewers for helping me find a gem that I never would have found by myself.

<Content>Very happy we chose The Castle Inn We chose The Castle Inn after doing extensive research on Tripadvisor for the start of our three week vacation touring California, Navada and Arizona. We stayed for three nights at the end of March.(Two Ads, two chd aged 16 and 12)We were extremely happy with our choice. We were very fortunate to meet the legendary Versa, who as every one else has said was so friendly, helpful and efficient. She made our stay in san francisco as memorable as the other wonderful things we saw and visited in this wonderful city.The hotel is in a nice, safe location, the rooms are basic, but don't be put off by this, they are large and clean and having a fridge, micro and coffee in rooms is very helpful. We hired a car but walked virtually every where: Fishermans Wharf, Lombard Street, Union Square, Golden Gate park etc.The added bonus of free safe parking and a mini breakfast should put this hotel/motel at the top of any ones choice list. I would certainly recommend it.

<Content>Beware! After reserving a room six months in advance via the telephone we arrived at the Castle Inn only to find out that they gave our room away. We chose the Castle Inn based on all the reviews from TripAdvisor. I called Castle Inn twice to confirm my reservations. On both occasions the receptionist was in a hurry and the phone conversations ended fast. One week before our reservation and just before getting on our cruise in LA I called one more time to confirm, yes, we will see you then. After taking the Super Shuttle to the Castle Inn from Oakland Airport (we arrived at the Castle Inn at 3:00 p.m.) we were stunned to find out they gave our room away! What good is having a confirmation number if it doesn't mean they have a room for you. We were told that they tried to contact us, funny we were on a cruise with no phone! Lucky for us we ended up at the Nob Hill Motor Inn just around the corner, by far a better facility for the same price! My advice to everyone, Confirm, Confirm and re-confirm and don't let the hurried receptionist off the phone until you have verified all telephone numbers and credit card numbers with them or you could wind up with just a confirmation number and no room!

<Content>Perfect Location and Price The Castle Inn hotel is a perfect base camp for touring San Franscisco. It is located in a wonderful and safe neighborhood with lots of local restaurants and entertainment. It is in walking distance of the Fisherman's Warves, North Beach (Little Italy and China town), Ghiradelli Square, Lombard Street, Coit Tower, etc. The owners were extremely helpful providing you with tourist info and maps explaining how to get everywhere using the public transportation. The rooms were clean and large with beds that were quite comfy. The bathroom was OK in size with a great showerhead. The only drawback about the hotel are the thin walls. You can hear normal toned conversations taking place next door. But this really wasn't a problem since people respected the quiet hours. For the price, location, and hospitality, you can't go wrong. I would definately go back to Castle Inn.

<Content>Great room, great location, not so friendly staff Stayed in the Castle Inn for 4 nights at the start of a 3 week holiday to San Francisco/Mexico/Vegas. We were flying from Ireland and because of a delay in Atlanta were going to arrive at the Castle Inn at 1am, instead of the pre arranged 8pm. I rang the hotel from Atlanta to let them know, and was greeted by a very loud sigh over the phone by a woman who told me her husband would not be pleased at having to get up to let us in. After travelling for 27hrs we arrived at the Castle Inn to be 'welcomed' by a less than happy man. We decided after our welcome to avoid the duo as much as possible. The rooms in the hotel itself were excellent and very clean and the area was brilliant with plenty of places to eat,and it was only a 15min walk downill to Fisherman's Wharf. All in all would probably stay here again but were sorry we missed out on the hospitality others experienced.

<Content>Great Neighborhood I can vouch for all the positive things that other reviewers have already said. Some other things you will be happy to know: great local bars within walking distance, mid-price restaurants nearby, but kitchens close PROMPTLY at 10. Castle Inn has prepared a spreadsheet of common bus routes for sightseeing with station cross streets-this was extremely helpful. As others have said, Varsa is absolutley wonderful, beyond helpful in planning our outings. On the last day we were there, I met Arlene (?didn't catch her name, I think that was on the business card) she was less pleasant than Varsa. Don't let her deter you! Castle Inn is definitely the place to stay.

<Content>Felt like a local. Perfect home base to enjoy SF from.Versa was just as wonderful as other reviews make her sound ... and the perfect tour guide (Thanks Versa for all of your recommendations - you rock)Neighborhood felt very safe and comfortable.We didn't rent a car and are glad we didn't BUT the free parking is a rare thing ... just buy the MUNI pass. (We saw tickets on cars  expensive parking lots every where.) Public transportation/restaurants everything is close.Room was spotless. Big, comfortable bed. Everything worked. Quiet. Great price. We'll be back!!Tip - walk through the tunnel on Broadway and you are in Chinatown and only a few more easy blocks to City Lights Bookstore.Tip - SEGWAY tour was huge fun.Tip - wear your most comfortable shoes  a light raincoat/windbreaker.

<Content>Highly Recommend This was my first time visiting San Francisco and it wouldn't have been as great had it not been for the staff at the Castle Inn. My mother (a picky traveler) and I were traveling and only had two days in San Francisco. We checked in and were greeted by the friendliest, most helpful staff. She gave us a map and a DETAILED overview of the city...places to see, things to do. She also provided us with a list of bus routes and pick-up points, most of which are within 1/2 block of the Inn. We were able to get around the city by bus and see a lot of great sites! We did get lost at one point, called the Inn, and they were happy to get us back on our site-seeing path. The rooms were large and provided a microwave, refrigerator, wireless internet, and the bed was comfortable. The day we checked out I was able to keep my car parked at the Inn while we toured around town. My first trip to San Francisco wouldn't have been as productive or stress-free had it not been for the helpful info, great location, and nice accomadations that the Castle Inn provided. I won't even consider staying anywhere else on my next visit to San Francisco.

<Content>Great Value, Great Location My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at the Castle Inn, and would definitely return. Nothing fancy, but good value for the price, and excellent location - within walking distance to many locations and close to transportation. Rooms were clean and hotel staff were very helpful. Should we find ourselves in San Francisco again, this will be where we stay without question.

<Content>Great Hotel 鈥?Great Location-Wonderful Value! We really enjoyed our stay at the Castle Inn! We were there for 4 nights and enjoyed it more than our stays at much more expensive places. What made it special were the attitudes of the innkeepers! They all were friendly, helpful, and just enjoyable to talk to. They set up our tours of San Francisco, plus arranged for airport transfers. They were always available to answer questions, provide maps, and give advice. This certainly saved us a lot of money, time, and effort! As far as location, we thought it was great. Bus lines run on either side, and the Cable Car was several blocks over. Parking is free 鈥?a great thing to find in San Francisco. There were many good restaurants, shops, coffee shops, and a grocery store within an easy walk. Our room was large with a King Size bed (extremely comfortable), refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, TV, table and chairs. There was also an iron and board. The shower had plenty of power, and everything was very clean and well maintained! Breakfast was what we expected: juice, yogurt, sweet rolls, muffins, a selection of granola bars, fresh fruit. We could just load up our tray and eat in our room. There was always hot water in the office for Tea, Hot Chocolate, or Instant coffee, and they were happy to provide extra coffee for the coffeemaker (unlike many much more expensive hotels). We will definitely stay here on our next trip to SF.

<Content>Great Value! Great Location! My wife and I recently were looking for a nice yet economic place to stay in the San Francisco area. Not only was it a great value but it was within walking distance to the cable cars and fishermans wharf .. among other tourist areas as well. Our flight landed at 11:30pm and I didn't realize that the office closes at 11. I was very happy that I called ahead and notifed them of this. Since this is not a Marriott or Hyatt the owners actually run the place and are onsite. So when we arrived at 1:00am, they literally woke up to check us in. Do them a favor, be considerate. If arriving late, call ahead!Given the hour, he was happy to check us in and good to have a quick chat with. In the morning the continental breakfast is nothing to brag about but has a little something for all tastes; OJ, coffee, fruit, danish, yogurt, granola bars, etc.I would definately stay here again. This was a GREAT place to stay and especially if you are on a budget. I would recommend this place to stay at so that you can spend more on a wine tour or two in Napa Valley or for splurging on a nice restaurant. Honestly, you are only in the hotel room to sleep and get ready for the day, right? PLUS, they have free parking. A rariety in San Francisco.

<Content>Best value and service OK, this is my third stay in San Francisco. I've stayed in 3 hotels and each time I've located a better hotel - Best Western Americania - dodgy location; Hotel Adagio - still a bit of a dodgy location, but a bit more expensive than the Castle Inn.... Anyway, the Castle Inn is by far the best of these 3. And the hotel's area is a lot safer than the areas around Union Square and City Hall - where many other hotels are located. Once you get to San Francisco you'll understand this statement better - there are a lot of crazy people who approach you in the street in this city - unlike other major western cities (NY, London, Paris, Tokyo etc). Homelessness is out of control.The hotel room was massive - with a living area space to eat, and a decent sized bathroom. The service, as noted by others here, is exceptional.While it is a bit of a hike to get down to Union Square - a walk and bus, or a walk and cable car (if you can get on), the hotel is located in a nice area of Nob Hill and is walkable to Fisherman's Wharf etc.If I ever return to San Francisco, I would come back to the Castle Inn.

<Content>Lived up to Expectations We have just returned from a skiing holiday at Lake Tahoe with 3 days in San Francisco before returning home. Our accommodation at Tahoe was booked through the travel agent but we decided to go it alone with the accommodation in San Francisco. Having pored over the Tripadvisor reviews we decided on the Castle Inn. We were not disappointed. After having flight delays, and baggage lost, we finally arrived at the Castle Inn. Varsa was behind the desk at reception with her ever-smiling face. She is always cheery, has a wealth of information, and has prepared a printed sheet of well known attractions and how to get to them using public transport. The room was large and very clean. There was ample room to put skis, boots, bags and not even notice they were there. We had a king size bed, cable television, more than adequate heating, and plenty of very hot water.There is also a microwave and frig in the room. It is a 10 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf, although a bit hilly on the way back. The area is very safe, which was a big factor in choosing this hotel. There are quite a few little restaurants close by. Breakfast, with a choice of coffee, several fruit, yoghurt, pastries and breakfast bars, is included and available at reception. We didn't have a car, but there is also free parking. Having not been to San Francisco for almost 10 years, our only regret was that we didn't have longer there. This hotel is not the Hilton, but it is a homely, clean, roomy hotel at much less than Hilton prices. You would have to be incredibly fussy, or very unlucky, to be disappointed.

<Content>Best deal in San Francisco My wife and I stayed at the Castle Inn for a week and were impressed in every way. We had a fresh set of linens every night when we returned to our room, the bathroom was cleaned and restocked with necessities and the staff at the front desk were quick to answer any questions we had. They also offered tips for tourists. FREE parking was also a definite bonus, when most hotels in S.F. charged $25 or more per night.The location was great, within walking distance to Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, cable car stops, Pier 39 and Coit Tower.We would definitely recommend the Castle Inn to any traveler to San Francisco. We will stay there again during our next visit to the city.

<Content>Great choice I was headed into San Francisco for another few days of business. Have stayed at most of the pricier big name places in the City at one point or another in the past 30 yrs, but I decided to shop around on the web for reviews of as many places as I could before decideing where to stay. After reading all the reviews of the Castle Inn I decided to give it a try as I had somehow overlooked this place in the past and the very postive reviews intrigued me, for the price quoted in San Francisco. I was a bit apprehensive despite all the positive feedback on this site.However, upon arrival and check in my fears evaporated. This place offered me free covered parking, a great location close to everything I needed, and a great price. Most of all I was impressed with the cleanliness of the room I was given. Top notch in every way, even more impressive to me than some here I have paid $$$ for and gotten less. Everything here was clean, worked as promised, and available. I had to constantly remind myself this place was only a 3 star motel. The management couldnt do enough to ensure that I had whatever I needed while I stayed here and went out of their way to provide it for me. I will definitely stay here again and recommend this place to anyone who is coming to San Francisco. Thanks for making my visit to the City smooth and flawless.

<Content>Very nice place We spent 3 nights in the Castle Inn's only suite. It is not a fancy hotel but was perfect for four people (two adults with two teenagers). The suite is more like an apartment and has two good sized clean rooms each with a king sized bed. There is a good sized bath and huge walk-in closet. The larger of the rooms also had two sofas and two chairs. The second room is off of a hallway--good for privacy. The suite has a small refrigerator with separate freezer, microwave, iron and board. We used a roll-away in the larger room for one of the teenagers. It was far better than the usual roll-away. More like a twin bed on wheels. The cost of the suite was far less than two separate rooms would have been and if we found two rooms at another hotel for what we paid for the suite, I am sure that they would not be nearly as nice. The Castle Inn is located in the Russian Hill area of the city, a vibrant and convenient neighborhood with many varied restaurants within a few block walk. We felt more like we were living like locals than staying at a hotel. The free covered parking is a big plus. Cable cars are nearby, only 21/2 blocks. We bought 3 day city transportation passes at $18 each and used them a lot, a bargain particularly since the cable cars are otherwise $5/ride. Fisherman's wharf was a pleasant walk and also a great cable car ride away. Desk staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Altogether, the Casle Inn is a fine choice.

<Content>Pretty Good I was generally impressed with the Castle Inn, especially for the price. It's true the decor is not that modern, but the rooms are large, clean and comfortable and have huge beds. The free parking was a real bonus (although the bays are a bit of a squeeze) and the staff were helpful, which we appreciated as 1st time visitors to SF. There is a good, cheap Thai restaurant about 200 meters along the street if you are in need of something to eat when you arrive.

<Content>Don't be fooled this a 2 star at best My wife and I stayed there because of the many reviews from other traverlers. We ignored the 2 star rating from Orbitz and hotel.com. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! The walls are thin and we listened to the couple in the next room until they decided to go to sleep. The room had a damp musty smell. The room was as descrbed in size and features. It is an older unit and needs updating.

<Content>Varsa is the best! Stayed with my parents at Castle Inn 1/13 - 16/06. I have nothing bad to say about the place. It's not new, it doesn't have lots of glitz but that's not what I'm looking for in a place to stay. It was very clean. Perks are the free parking, breakfast and refrigerator (not just one of those small things but actually had a separate freezer). My mother broke her wrist on the trip and Varsa came from behind the desk to give her a hug! Made my Mom's day. :) Thanks Varsa for making our stay special!From Mom: They were very gracious, it was a joy staying there and it was a great location. From Dad: Clean, well located and nice people.

<Content>loved it Excellent location; at VanNess and Broadway provides *easy* bus and taxi access, very short (2 1/2 blocks) walk to cable car line. Very safe section of town. The way the place is laid out, the rooms lie behind the office and elevator and such, so things tend to be quiet (you're in a big city here folks, so you do get fire engines and such!) The staff went way way way out of their way to make us feel at home, to help us find things and to get around. We had enough room to layout and open four pieces of luggage, with a table and desk to boot. House cleaning was efficient and thorough. Fridge and microwave were clean and functional. Bathroom (toilet/shower) was small but completely clean and functional. The micro/fridge, sink, mirror/vanity area was a roomy space separate from the toilet. Posted photos here on trip advisor from other reviews are legit representations. If you have a car (I don't recommend a car in SanFran) their off street parking is simply AMAZING.

<Content>Great Location My husband and I went to San Francisco, California on January 12 thru 14th. We stayed at the Castle Inn. It was the perfect place to stay. The rooms are clean and just fine, very safe place. Just a block up was a happening spot to go to at night. Great little cafes and bars. We walked from the Fisherman's Warf to our hotel. It's 25 minutes from airport with one turn. The hotel manager there, Varsa, was very accommodating and knows the City like the back of her hand. She was very helpful and extremely polite. We actually found this place from Trip Advisor and would definitely stay here again. It was our last two days of our trip and we just wanted a clean, safe, great location to stay. We left our room at 9:00 a.m. and didn't return until 8:00-9:00 p.m. San Fran is a great City. Must visit Alcatraz at night and take one of the bus tours recommened by Varsa, excellent time!!!!

<Content>excelent ! value 4 money. just returned from San Francisco and had an excellent stay at the CASTLE INN hotel on Broadway , this place is definitely a value for money place the hotel by it self has no aesthetic appeal but the room was comfortable , very spacious with a refrigerator ,microwave and iron board , we even had a view which is unheard of at that price , the hotel had a safe and quite feel with decent occupants the people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful , the best thing abt this place was that we had free parking which is a boon in a city like SF , the hotel is not very close to all the attractions but since we rented a car it worked out fine. to sum it up I seriously did not expect so many perks and a high comfort level at the price I paid - I would definitely stay hear again - an absolute value for money .

<Content>Good stay, good value. Very good location, Indian, Thai, Starbucks, all nearby. 2 blocks to cable car stop. Clean room, brand new bathroom fixtures. Even behind the toilet was squeaky clean. Microwave and fridge was nice touch. Front desk staff was very friendly, handed us with various city tour info without asking. Older building but remodeling was very successfull. Parking was not only plentiful, but it has motion sensor that beeps for security. Thoughtful measure. The bonus was free WiFi internet. I wake up in various hotels over 280 days a year and I can tell you, this hotel was a pleasant surprise.

<Content>Loved it San Francisco, Hotel Castle Inn: Great family atmosphereDate: 10-27-05 trough 11-04-05Reviewer: A very satisfied CustomerWe spent about a week in the small, home-like atmosphere of the Castle Inn in San Francisco. After walking quite a few blocks uphill to the hotel (by choice, for our own adventure; not having been in San Francisco before), we were glad to be able to relax once we were up in our room. Everyday we left our hotel room early and came back after nightfall and we were more than happy to relax in the atmosphere of our room.We enjoyed the fact that it wasn't a huge hotel and had almost a 'homey' feel to it. Everyone there was kind and helpful. The Castle Inn was the perfect place if you're looking for a good value, a small and clean environment; plus it's the perfect place if you want to be close to all the great sights of the city. Overall, our experience was great.

<Content>Just great! We stayed at this hotel for three nights. The manager/owner of the Castle inn, a young, very friendly woman, could be a city guide too! She gave us a map of SF, after she had drawn circles around the most interesting sights and areas. We got the most amazing hotelroom for this low price (for a big city), on the top floor, facing the street. Yes, the room is not renovated recently and no, it's not fancy or luxurious...but it's special (nice, uncommon bathroom), clean and the view was nice. Had a fridge and a microwave too. AND...parking is free!!Don't expect a ****- hotel, but if you need a place to stay at a great location (cablecar 2 blocks, coffeehouses around the corner) and you don脛t want to spend much money...this is it!We would definately come back!!!

<Content>We liked the Castle Inn, though it wasn't perfect Three of us stayed at the Castle Inn last week after two nights at the Sheraton on Fisherman's Wharf. In terms of location, we much preferred the Castle Inn, the neighborhood it's located in is such a great place to dine, walk around, have coffee, and window-shop. It's much more of the real SF than Fisherman's Wharf, which is like Disneyland. It's also a few blocks from the cable car, so it was pretty easy to take the cable cars downtown, and we rode the cable cars as much as we could. In terms of the room itself, the Sheraton was of course fancier digs, but we liked our room fine, it had 2 Queen beds, and it was perfectly fine for our needs. And they were generous with towels.As everybody agrees, Versa is the best. She was so friendly, so helpful with restaurant recommendations and transportation advice. I really liked her a lot, she really made our stay a pleasant one,she's that place's #1 draw. We stayed at the Castle Inn over New Year's weekend, so prices were jacked up. I think if I had to pay top dollar like I did for that weekend, I'd stay somewhere nicer and closer to the action. But we did get free parking, and that was very helpful, and I appreciated being able to use my laptop in the room to cruise the net and read my email.The only two things that bothered me about our stay at the Castle Inn were: 1. we asked them if we could leave our suitcases there after checking out since we had a midnight flight. They said yes, and we thought they'd put our luggage behind the desk or in some other secure location. When we came bsck after a day of sightseeing, our luggage was exactly where we had left it, in the small front office, next to the door. I was glad that I had kept my laptop with me, or I really would have been upset. Anyone could have walked off with our stuff. Also 2. When we came back to the hotel after dinner to retrieve our luggage and get to SFO, we asked the owner, Marsh, to call us a cab. He suggested instead that we take a limo that his friend drives, his friend was right there, it'd cost us $50, not much more than a cab, he said (our cab from SFO to Fisherman's Wharf a week before had cost us $42 plus tip). We felt pressured to take the limo, even though it cost more than the cab, and we're not rolling in cash. And, I found out later, I could have gotten a limo for $40--there was an advertisement in the Bay Area Guide for a limo to the airport for $39. Next time, I'll make my plans for transportation to the airport ahead of time, so I don't find myself in that kind of a situation again. It was fine riding in the limo, (sedan), but I could have planned better and saved some money, instead of feeling like I had to take this guy up on his offer of having his friend take us to the airport.Overall, we liked the Castle Inn, it's a perfectly nice motel with a very competent and helpful manager (Versa) in a super neighborhood with great coffeehouses (like Royal Grounds) and restaurants (like Yabbies and the Hyde St. Seafood Bistro).

<Content>Superb We stayed at the castle inn, early Feb 2005. We where here for four nights touring San Francisco.The stay at the Castle Inn was absolutely fantastic. If anyone comes to San Francisco and is looking for reduced cost in accomodation, great service, fantastic location, free parking and overall a wonderful experience, Come to Castle Inn.The staff where very friendly from the point of Check Inn, informing me where to go, where not to go, providing a map, etc.They organised Taxis, bookings for restaurants, assisted us with any need we may have had.Whilst the room was possibly on the small side, the ammeneties where sufficient, though the bed was average but seriously what Bed in any hotel is as good as your own?I would recommend that anyone travelling to San Francisco stay here, no matter what your purpose is.If anyone is disappointed by this hotel, it would purely be giving themselves an expectation that is beyond reasonable.I will definitely be staying here again, in fact My Wife and I, who are planning another trip to the States later in the year (2006) will be coming to San Francisco again to stay at this hotel.Thank-you Castle Inn for assisting in making our holiday fantastic. See You Soon. :)

<Content>Great stay  I was at Castle Inn this summer for a couple of days.The hotel is very centrally located, and parking is provided (not a spacious one, mind U).The hosts Marshall  Arlene are more than friendly, and filled me with attention, hints, travel tips and maps: what a great way of greeting a guest.The room was very big and clean.The furniture may not be Ritz-Carlton like, but it is not bad for the price.I would really recommend the place, for a no-frills pleasant stay in central SF!

<Content>Didn't feel welcomed I booked this place (6 nights) based on the many good feedback on the hotel though there were some not so good one..I ignored those as exceptions. I guess my luck will have it I didn't enjoy my stay here. Room was small/tight, 2 queen bed, noisy heater right up against the bed, holes in blanket, didn't feel welcomed. Informed the desk but not offered any other alternatives even though there were vacancies - Marshal was ok but my encounter with the other lady did not give me a nice feeling. Breakfast was minimal and you had this lady staring at you without saying a word as you pick up a dough nut or coffee. I didn't get to meet Varsa so maybe like I said just my luck. Others may have enjoyed the stay here...I  my family really din't. I left after 2 nights and was threatened that I would have to give 3 nights notice i.e. pay up 3 additional nights and was being done a favour by letting you go - thats guest treatment for you - I guess I was to be grateful being let go. I had asked to speak to the manager but didn't get to. I moved down the road, paid $5 more per night and got a spacious 2 queen bed room - nice, quiet, frendly treatment. Suffice to say I will not come back here again. I didn't want to write but felt that other visitors should also have the benefit of different feedback and from real and dissatisfied guests (i.e. if paying customer are considered guests at this place). I'm moving on and putting this experience behind me as learnings for my future travel bookings.

<Content>Indeed Value for Money Stayed at the Castle Inn from Dec 12-15. It's value for money -- functional with clean and spacious room especially the toilet. Parking for a huge 8-seater vehicle is not a problem. Varsa is very cheerful  very helpful. Would recommend to anyone who has plan to SF. Chia Family from Singapore

<Content>Very good value I recently stayed at the Castle Inn and it was very good quality. Very friendly and helpful front desk.The rooms were very clean and the maid service was very efficient.Free breakfast was a nice touch.The area around the hotel is not bad, there are a few bars and restaurants. I can recommend the Chinese place around the corner( not the Thai place), it doesn't look much but the food was absolutely top quality.Within walking distance are 2 cable car lines, Lombard street and fishermans Wharf. Quality.

<Content>Highly recommended Booked this suite on-line. A family owned  operated hotel  very central to most city sights. The suite was roomy, clean,  free parking was available. Extras such as the roll-away bed were already set up when we arrived. A continental breakfast was also included. Being foreigners arriving on Thanksgiving, the owner telephoned various local restaurants on our behalf, to locate one where we could sample the traditional turkey dinner. We would definitely stay here again  will recommend this hotel to others - a real gem of a hotel with friendly, helpful owner-operators. The highlight in accommodation during our three week trip to the USA.

<Content>Great Place, Great Price, Great Staff, But... Well so much good had been said about this hotel I knew we would be happy staying here. It was easy to find, parking for free is a bonus and boy oh boy was Versa a wealth of information! She was always smiling, and ready with any questions. We booked the city tour thru her (she did all the calling) and she helped us reserve tickets for Alcatraz.The location is perfect, right in the middle of the city, easy to walk anywhere, or hop on transit. And we did, we saw so much!The positives on the room are that is was a large room, king bed was nice, it was also very clean.Negatives, sheets had small holes or even areas where it was torn. Towels were small and very rough. Very thin walls and floors, could hear your neighbours all around. Furniture was old and shows the wear and tear. Water in the shower went from cold to hot and back again. All in all it was adequate for what we needed. The price was certainly good. But I don't think I would stay here again, I may need to pay more and get more.

<Content>Great room for the money Stayed 3 ni. early Nov 05. Spacious and super clean room. Well maintained premises, most helpful and friendly hosts. A great location to explore S.F. by foot and public transit. Amenities within a few blocks. Our room overlooked Broadway St (2nd floor) but traffic is very light during the night if you want to leave windows open (We enjoyed early morning viewing of the residents across the street doing Tai Chi in the gardens). We felt safe in this neighbourhood. We stayed at 5 other locations outside S.F. during the remaining portion of our trip; based on price, location, amenities, cleanliness, etc. this hotel was the best value we encountered.Would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Nice hotel , Exceptional service At first sight the Castle Inn was a bit disappointing, nothing really Castle-like about its appearance! But haven鈥檛 all the wise people told us 鈥?appearances are deceptive! That is the adage that best applies to the Castle Inn, it is the hidden jewel of SFO. The rooms were surprisingly spacious (by SFO standards); super clean, well lit and very tastefully decorated. The view from the windows was amazing. And what can I say about Varsa, she was so helpful and so considerate. She was always well equipped with maps, directions, and all kinds of information. And always prompt to provide local tips and suggestions.The motel is located in a very safe and well-lit area, we were out till midnight and never felt uncomfortable. All the attractions are within close walking distances, we walked everywhere (and we are really lazy people)! Polk Street is dotted with quaint shops, we could have spent hours browsing there. The area also offers a multitude of eating-places nearby, offering a variety of world cuisines. The Indian restaurant round the corner has amazing food! Our only regret, wish we could spend more time in SFO!

<Content>Castle Inn was OUR castle SF We stayed at the Castle Inn (managed by Varsa and Sy)for 5 nights in October. Varsa should be THE SF spokesperson!! She knew everything or if she didn't, she knew how to locate it. The rooms were clean and comfy, the parking was covered and FREE, the amenities were plentiful and the location was THE BEST, in a residential neighborhood, but CLOSE to public transportation and in walking distance to Chinatown and more. We'll be back in San Francisco because we left our HEARTS at Castle Inn. We could see the top of the Golden Gate bridge from our room with a view!!

<Content>Friendly, clean hotel We stayed at the Castle Inn for 2 nights in Sept 2005 as part of a trip to the US. The motel was spacious and clean, there was secure, free parking and reception staff could not do enough to help. Well located for visits to Union Square/Fisherman's Wharf area, and we could also just see the top of the Golden Gate Bridge from the balcony/walkway outside the room. Would recommend.

<Content>Nice place to stay We just returned from six nights at the Castle, and it lived up to all the positive reviews that it received on Trip Advisor. Although it doesn't look like much at first glance, the rooms are very nice, well equipped, and clean. The neighborhood is also quite pleasant, with good dining and shopping nearby. The people who work there are extremely helpful. They really go out of their way to make sure your San Francisco experience is enjoyable.

<Content>Like everyone else we really liked this hotel It is hard to come up with something original so I won't try. We stayed at the Castle Inn for 3 nights in August and would highly recommend it. At first I had thought of staying around Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf. I am so glad that we didn't, we saved money as those hotels were much more expensive and ended up staying in a great neighbourhood rather than a tourist area. We loved Polk Street it had everything with atmosphere thrown in. Versa who was the only person we met ,was very pleasant and helpful. The rooms were comfortable. We didn't use the breakfast facility, it would not suit everyone but will suit a lot of people. Just diagnally across the road was a great diner where we enjoyed breakfast, another day we went to down to the bay.The hotel is nothing flash to look at but shines where it matters most. The Castle Inn deserves all the accolades it gets, I think their secret is making you feel like they care.

<Content>Top marks! This hotel is fantastic - it is in a safe, quiet location with free parking, it is near the cable car, the family suite is absolutely huge, and the staff (particularly Varsa) are very welcoming and extremely helpful. Breakfast is small but perfectly adequate (yoghurt, fruit, pastries, coffee and juice). I can't think of anything we were unhappy with. Highly recommended.

<Content>Great place to stay We stayed at the Castle Inn for 6 nights. We made our booking based on reviews and we were not disappointed. We booked direct with the hotel so even before we got there Varsa had contacted us with details of trips and things to do. We booked the City Tour and the Wine Country Tour. Both were excellent. Varsa also advised us to book our trip to Alcatraz in advance and that was good advice. We did the night tour - fabulous. Back to the Castle Inn - our room was spacious and spotlessly clean. Having a fridge is a bonus. We didn't have any problems with noise. The location is great. We walked everywhere but there's plenty of public transport if the hills get too much. The local restaurants are great. We particularly enjoyed the Rex Cafe for Sunday Brunch and Yabbie's for seafood. Both are on Polk Street just round the corner. The hotel provides coffee and pastries for breakfast but we liked to pick up fresh bagels from the Bagelry which is also on Polk Street. The Castle Inn offers great value, friendly service and a perfect location.

<Content>Castle Inn- Highly Recommended We stayed at the Castle Inn for 5 nights in July at the start of our three week tour of California. The booking was made purely on reading the good reviews on this website.We arrived at the Castle Inn after a long flight from Belfast via London travelling with our three young boys.Marshall and Arlene were very helpful during our checkin and throughout our 5 night stay. The family suite we got was not fancy, but very spacious, extremely clean and comfortable with separate bedroom, mini fridge, iron and ironing board. The breakfast included was adequate.The Castle Inn is situated in a very safe area and within walking distance to all the tourist areas (our youngest is only 5 and he managed the walks).We really enjoyed our stay at the Castle Inn and would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone who wishes to visit San Francisco.We hope to return some day! Thanks Marshall and Arlene for making our stay at the Castle Inn very enjoyable.

<Content>Great value and location! We chose the Castle Inn after reading all the positive reviews on this site. Four of us stayed in a room with two queen-sized beds and it had everything we needed including a TV, microwave, and fridge. The breakfast provided included coffee, tea, orange juice, yogurt, fruit, danish and muffins and gave us a good start to the day. If you're looking for excellent value for money the Castle Inn meets the bill - it's a decent place to stay at a great location as it's only a short walk to Fisherman's Wharf. The staff were very helpful, providing us with bus info and a map, giving suggestions on where to eat and ordering us a taxi when we left the hotel to return home. Before our stay, Varsa was good enough to book us a trip to Muir Woods and Sausalito which we really enjoyed. We opted to return to San Francisco by taking the ferry from Sausalito - giving us a spectacular view of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz.Considering we had never visited San Fransisco before we're really pleased with how well we did on choice of location and place to stay. We'd certainly stay at the Castle Inn again!

<Content>Good location - good value As others have noted, this hotel is in a great location and is very good value for money considering how overpriced some hotels are in this city. The hotel is well maintained and the room was clean and comfortable. The room had a fridge and microwave, especially useful for breakfast as no meals are offered by the hotel. The hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is in a safe area where it is not a problem to walk even after dark. Fishermans Wharf, Chinatown and crooked street are within 15 minutes walk as well as numerous restaurants almost on the doorstep.One thing we really appreciated about the hotel was the free parking. Some hotels close-by were asking for up to $36 a night for parking!

<Content>Good value in San Francisco Stayed for 3 nights at start of holiday. Service on desk was excellent. Room above average, clean and comfortable. Breakfast nothing fancy but decent start to the day.Located slightly away from everything but less than 20 mins walking distance to all main sights, bus stop just outside if you want to rest your legs after walking up and down the hills! The hotel is perfectly located for driving to and the free parking is a big saving. Local restaurants are good value and enough choice.My only suggestion would be to request a room away from the front of the hotel if you think you will be woken by traffic noise. Don't let this put you off though, my partner is normally a light sleeper and we had no problems in a room very close to the front of the hotel, but it may be a problem for some.Overall very good value with excellent advice and information from the hosts, thoroughly recommended, but book in advance as was full the whole weekend we were there.

<Content>Thanks Trip Advisor! We also stayed at the Castle Inn because of the great reviews on this site, and we weren't disappointed. The room was clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the parking was free. Our favorite part was the area where the hotel was located. Just down Polk street are a Walgreen's, a Peet's Coffee and Tea, a small local grocery, a quaint local coffee house, and a variety of restaurants. And, it's a short walk to the cable car lines, which will take you to all the sights. This was a great place for us to begin and end our days of touring. If you're looking for a no frills home base on a trip to see the city, the Castle Inn is for you.

<Content>Great Service at Castle Inn We stayed at the Castle Inn during the first week in August of thisyear, and had a truly enjoyable experience. The best part of theexperience was the young woman named Varsa at the frontdesk. Varsa was capable, knowledgeable, helpful, and alwayscheerful in handling our many inquiries about San Francisco,while single-handedly managing phones and other guests. Wehope that you treasure her as we did!

<Content>Reviews are right on-the-money...Great hotel! My family of 5 stayed here August 18-22, and were extremely happy! We chose the hotel exclusively due to these reviews, and it lived up to our expectations: a comfortable hotel with parking, in a great, safe neighborhood. An added benefit--rooms have microwave, fridge, coffee maker, and iron/board.Even before we arrived, they were wonderful! Knowing I had 3 children, Marshall reserved one of the larger rooms that could accommodate a cot. On another call, Versa gave me advice on buying tickets online for Alcatraz (would never have known they sell out), and emailed me directions. Marshall checked us in, and Arline offered a coupon when she heard we were going to the Culinary Institute! When we asked for extra pillows, Marshall knocked on the door within minutes...when we returned late, he moved his car to give us room to park our minivan. There wasn't a thing they wouldn't do for us. Arline even gave me band-aids for my daughter one morning, on the way out!We appreciated the breakfast, and felt very welcomed at the Castle Inn. Everyone who wrote positive reviews helped make my decision to choose this gem of a hotel...we all know it's not the Four Seasons, but it's a great deal in a major city such as San Francisco! Would gladly stay there again--the managers make this a great place!

<Content>Perfect Location We stayed the last week of August in the Suite. It was a perfect room for us because of our two teenage boys. Very large suite, comfy k.size beds in both rooms. The kids had their own tv with two couches and we had a seperate bedroom with tv. and dresser drawers. There is a large walk in closet, with shelves for luggage and clothes, and a microwave and two!! mini-fridges. We did a deluxe city tour the first day and we were very happy with our choice of Castle Inn after touring the city. The Union Square area was recommended to us by a travel agent, however it is typical Big City downtown. Lots of nice stores for a day visit, but lots of bums and we wouldn't have felt safe there after dark. Castle Inn is located in what we considered a yuppy residential area and is close and within walking distance to Fish. Wharf, Pier 39, Alcatraz Ferry, Lombard etc. where we spent most of our time. Around the corner there is a drugstore, great restaurants, Starbucks, Tea Emporium and a Bank America with an ATM machine we felt safer using than the no-name ones at tourist spots. At the front desk Marshall and Arlene were VERY helpful with directions, bus routes, areas to avoid and areas to definitely see. Rooms are a little older but very clean. Suite is a little noisy because of traffic but when we were there at night we simply closed the windows and that helped alot. If you have an AAA or CAA membership you should get a better rate. We felt very safe at night in the area and the cab ride from the Wharf area is only about $6-$7, which we really only took advantage of a couple of times because we were tired. The cont. breakfast fed my 17 and 13 yr. old boys very nicely. It was more than enough food and they loved the hot choc. throughout the day. We used the local transit the most what with the bus route/transfers to all the tourist spots easy to catch around the corner from the hotel. The bus passes are a good deal, and they can also be used on the cable cars instead of paying per ride!!! (adds up quickly). We would definitely stay here again and will recommend Castle Inn to friends. I'm glad we trusted what was written on this site. Mississauga, Canada.

<Content>Pay Close Attention Pay close attention in the first five minutes of your visit as your host will give you all the information you need for a safe and enjoyable trip to San Fransisco. The local chamber of commerce should put this on DVD and send it to all prospective visitors. It made our siteseeing so easy as visitors from the UK. Hotel ideally positioned, room clean, all you could want for a visit - will recommend without hesitation

<Content>Helpful friendly staff We found this hotel to have a safe, good location. Staff are polite, interested in your trip and very helpful. The room was basic, but comfortable. We had a microwave and an iron and coffee making facilities. You can help yourself to coffee, tea, hot chocolate in the office at any time. The room was clean , although one thing was that it smelt like some sort of chemical or cleaning agent, which was quite overpowering.We had a lovely stay at the castle inn. Parking is adeqaute, but san fransisco is so compact anyway. Breakfast was ok...muffins, pastries etc in reception. Staff were wonderful and helpful!!

<Content>An Experience that is Difficult to Explain My wife and I visited SF for the first time and stayed at the Castle Inn (CI) for three nights. My initial impression at check in was that maybe we had selected accomodations that ran contrary to our tastes and preferences. We do not have any children and stay mostly at four-star hotels/resorts when we travel. In contrast, the CI is an older motel that has outward facing rooms. In the spirit of vacation, and based on user reviews, I kept an open mind. The rooms are what I would term economy, somewhat in the order of a Comfort Inn or a Motel 6. We found the room to be adequately clean. For those light sleepers, please keep in mind that the hotel is in the city. You will here normal traffic sounds and the rooms are not equipped with air conditioners. This is not uncommon in hotels/motels along the coast as the ocean breeze is used to cool the room. We were not bothered by the traffic and slept with the windows open the whole stay. While the rate may seem high relative to the accomodations, parking is free, which is a plus in a major metropolitan area. There is a coffee maker, microwave oven and refrigerator in the room. We particularly enjoyed having the refrigerator as it saved us alot of money on beverages.Two things that made our stay enjoyable here were: (1) the central location; and (2) Marshall, who provided us with alot of information on where and where not to go. We gathered advise from him almost daily, and based on his suggestions, we were even able to take the walking tour of Alcatraz, despite the fact it was listed as fully booked during the length of our stay.The location of CI is unique in that it is easy to get to all the major sights and attractions. Additionally, there are a range of places to eat within close proximity to the hotel (ranging from pizza to upscale casual dining), as well as a Walgreens within two blocks. Just ask Marshall for a suggestion. We found that the only time we were in our our room was to sleep, so we would not have used many of the ammenities found in higher-end hotels for this trip. There is just too much to see and do. Overall, we were happy with our stay at CI.

<Content>Save your money for a real san francisco experience My husband and I travel to San Francisco frequently. We usually stay in small hotels unique to the city. This time, along with a family member, we were traveling for a medical treatment. I chose this hotel based on reviews and location and reserved two rooms for two nights. When my surgery was cancelled and I called the hotel to see if we could make an adjustment as only my husband and myself needed one room for one night, all they could say was well, you have to pay for both rooms for both nights. No offer to try to rent the rooms. When we arrived and suggested that at least we could donate the rooms to a city agency for the needy, they were horrified and insisted that we should let them rent the rooms. One was rented for one night for half price. This hotel has a 72 hour cancellation policy which is self-serving and punitive. They appear to only care about tourists who are making one trip to San Francisco and to have no interest in cultivating follow-up business. Further, it turns out that this establishment is not a hotel but an aging standard motel. I recommend that tourists skip this place and pick one of the city's charming small hotels for a real San Francisco experience.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Castle Inn from 7/27 thru 7/31. We chose this hotel because of all the great reviews on Trip Advisor along with the reasonable price and convenient location. We had traveling with us my husband鈥檚 mother, sister and his nephew and his wife.We could not have been more pleased with the hotel. The rooms were roomy and very clean. Added bonus was having the refrigerator and microwave in our room. Everyone was very happy with their room.The free parking was a very big plus. We parked and used the bus for most of our San Francisco sightseeing. Buses were only one block over on either side of the hotel. The Wharf, Pier 39 and Ghairdelli square are in walking distance. However, my mother in law is 76 and we used the bus as the hills can be a bit strenuous.Versa in the front office is unbelievable. Very knowledgeable, very helpful and very friendly. She could not do enough for us. Like a previous poster said-One block away is a Walgreen鈥檚 for soda and snacks and there are several great restaurants with in walking distance. Very nice, safe neighborhood.Very highly recommend this hotel and if we are ever in San Francisco again, we will only stay at the Castle Inn.

<Content>Fantastic base for exploring San Francisco My wife and I stayed in ten hotels during a two-week trip around California, Nevada and Arizona and the Castle Inn gave the best value for money. Ideally placed for exploring San Francisco, the staff were really friendly and helpful, making us feel very welcome after a lengthy drive. The room was clean and comfortable and we thought the breakfast was good-especially when compared with most of the others we experienced. Of course the parking was a great advantage-we parked up and never thought about the car for the duration of our stay. We could hear traffic, but what do you expect in a city?!All in all, we can highly recommend the Castle Inn.

<Content>Comfortable  From check-in to departure three days later, The Castle Inn was perfect for us and Versa was incredibly helpful. Rooms are simple and clean. Nice to have a mini-fridge and microwave in the room for snacks and leftovers. Versa is a wonderful ambassador for San Francisco! Her restaurant recommendations were excellent (Polkers for breakfast and Habana, Hyde Street Seafood, and Ristorante Milano for dinner) and guidance on using cable cars and buses was extremely useful. Location is in a safe neighborhood that is centrally located for walking excursions to Chinatown, Coit Tower, Fisherman's Wharf, and Lombard St. If you want a great workout that will showcase some beautiful homes and views, take Broadway until you reach the Pacific Heights neighborhood. If you're looking for luxury this is not the place. But, if you are looking for a clean, comfortable, and friendly base for exploring SF, this is definitely the place!

<Content>Perfect for the money If you're looking for a safe, comfortable and reasonably priced hotel, this is it. The hotel and the room was very clean and the FREE parking was a plus and easy to park. The staff was very helpful and and very nice to deal with. A good location away from the crowd of the Wharf, yet close enough to get around. Restaurants close by as well as a Walgreens for shopping to fill your fridge or heat something in your microwave.

<Content>Lived up to great reviews We stayed here for two nights here recently based on reviews at TripAdvisor on the first leg of a long car trip with two grandsons and definitely were not disappointed. We found the Castle Inn's location to be very convenient and the free parking was a definite plus. We parked our van with no problem and didn't move it during our entire visit. A very short walk took us to the bus that goes to the Wharf, but one day we walked there. It's not that far away..and downhill! (We took a taxi back.) Our accomodations were roomy, having a fridge and microwave a definite plus and the continental breakfast was adequate.The only negative thing was that the wireless internet signal we got was very weak in our room but that was a minor problem. We'd definitely stay at the Castle Inn again.

<Content>Fantastic! We read reviews on this hotel on trip advisor and picked the hotel because of them. I am glad we did! This hotel is fantastic, I am almost afraid to let people know about it, because I want it to remain the same price and have availability next time I go. The location is perfect and we were able to catch a bus or trolley easily to anywhere we were going, just a few blocks away. Great restaurants nearby. Whenever we return we will always stay at this hotel! The owners are great and our 4 year old loved talking to them every day.

<Content>Castle Inn-very convenient The Castle Inn provides friendly service and a clean, comfortable room for a good price. Parking is free. It is conveniently located to most major attractions. The complimentary breakfast is a bit skimpy but Starbucks is just around the corner.

<Content>You'll Like It Large, clean, comfortable rooms at a fair price in San Francisco. We were given youth passes to the cable cars for our six and eight year old girls. Breakfast was plain and there's no public area to speak of. Water leaked from under the seal on the sliding shower door. This hotel is convenient to reach in city traffic if you are driving and the free parking is a reason to choose this over other budget options (Chancellor in Union Square was ours). I did not find parking a Chrysler mini-van at all difficult at Castle Inn, although others report a different experience. Housekeeping was very good. A bonus in the area for those with kids is Helen Wills park, an urban park about a block away. The activities director patiently showed the girls how to make a lanyard, even though we arrived well after 6 p.m. to play.

<Content>Friendly, Comfortable, Reassuring and Safe I had never traveled to or driven in San Francisco prior to our trip in June, 2005. I have two young children and I was nervous about safety, cleanliness, location, ability to maneuver around the city, etc. Varsa immediately puts you at ease. My concerns started to melt away during my conversation with her. She explained bus routes, noticed our young children and marked out areas of San Francisco on the map she said were not for kids, helped us with directions, etc. I, like many of the previous reviewers went with the Castle Inn because of excellent internet reviews and they are accurate. Hotel is clean, located in a safe neighborhood, guarantees you a free parking space (rare in San Francisco), refridgerator and microwave a plus, easy busride/walk to wharf, Ghiradelli Square, China Town.....all at a very reasonable price for San Francisco. All this is excellent but Varsa is the best thing about the Castle Inn. This is the only hotel I have ever reviewed on the internet. I felt compelled to review this one though and give it an excellent rating. This is where we will stay if and when we find ourselves in San Francisco again.

<Content>Taste of San Francisco living. This is a great economical base for touring SF. We booked two rooms for three nights based on the glowing recommendations on this web site and were not disappointed. Hotel location is perfect. Easy walking distance to Ghiardelli Sq, but a little tougher (hills) to Fishermans Wharf, Pier 39, Chinatown, North Beach and Lombard St. Climb the hill and take the cable car to Union Sq.What I really liked was the neighborhood atmosphere. It gave a taste of what draws people to live in SF - a variety of great neighborhood restaurants around the corner on Polk St or Union St (try the Little Thai two doors down). Stroll around the corner in the morning and browse the bageleries, boulangeries, coffee shops and tea houses for breakfast - up and comming without being too chi-chi. Felt safe even late at night.I checked out some of the other hotels we were considering and was glad we stayed at the the Castle - the Cow Hollow motels are too far away and the Union Sq area is too busy and grimy - and twice the price. The Castle is quiet enough to sleep with the windows open and free come-and-go parking makes this the best deal in SF.Only problem - one of our rooms had a slight odour which we couldn't place. Room certainly looked clean and new and since we didn't report it we can't really blame the management.

<Content>Very Satisfied!!! My sister and children and I stayed in The Castle Inn just before Memorial Day for a few nights and had a wonderful time. We were traveling on a budget and wanted to be safe and comfortable. While researching a place to stay in San Francisco, I noticed this Inn was the only place in this price range to receive consistant good reviews with no poor reviews. Sure, one lady complained about the color of the bathroom tiles, which I happened to like when I saw them. The tiles had a glazed rustic earthtone finish which only added to my experience because they weren't the same generic thing you see in every other Inn or Motel.It's true the Inn is run with 'Family Loving Care', we were given directions on how to get to places, places we should stay away from, etc. I would strongly advise if you are planning on walking to Fisherman's Wharf, which we did for the sake of exercise to retrace 'on the way back' the route you took there as laid out by Marshall. If you try to take a shortcut back to the Inn as we did from the north part of the Wharf by following the city map you will run into some mammoth hills that are so steep that the sidewalks are actually stairsteps. Let me just say that after that experience, all of the other walking exercises on our trip down along the coastline didn't seem nearly as challenging. After a 2 mile walk in Santa Barbara, we found ourselves saying to each other if we only had a good hill, like in San Fransisco...this is too easy! Also, be sure to wear comfortable and supportive athletic shoes. We never could have made it in street shoes or without the beautiful cool weather which greatly helped with the intensity of the workout required to return to the Inn from that direction.The front of the Inn has been painted a creamy yellow and is no longer grey as in the featured picture. The side of the Inn is layed out sort of like a multi-level La Quinta Inn, and I was a little worried because we had a lot of heavy luggage I knew we wouldn't be able to lug up the stairs. We were happy to discover they had an elevator along with handy rolling luggage carts. We had a room toward the back on the 2nd floor so the street noise was minimal. The parking garage was a squeeze but FREE, and we were prepared for that from reading previous reviews. Getting in is a challenge because it is a single car entry and once you get in, there are a few good places for a larger vehicle such as a van or SUV. The real trick is getting out which takes multiple manuverings, about 3 to 4 minutes worth and patience in getting the car into the correct position to head out, but since we walked or rode the trolley most of the time, we did not have to go in or out often. They also have an excellent camera system in the garage and covered stairway and elevator areas that is transmitted to the office which added to our feeling of safety. Never did we feel unsafe in this neighborhood and we walked to restaurants at night with two minor girls. They also had vending machines on the stair landings where you could get pop and bottled water for $1, you will pay $2.50 to $3.00 on the Wharf. If I had to change one thing, I would suggest that they extend their continental breakfast buffet time to 9:30 or 10:00am instead of 9:00am. which seemed a little early to me. We either had to procure our breakfast pastries early and store them in our room for after our walk or try to return from our early morning walks in time to partake of it before it shut down. We had a wonderful time visiting San Fransisco and staying at The Castle Inn was the best choice we could have made in this price range. We were not disappointed!! Keep up the good work Castle Inn and Good Luck!!!

<Content>A hidden gem in San Fran I found out about this hotel through the Trip Advisor website. We got a great deal for the Memorial weekend and paid significantly less than other hotels. If you are looking for posh, this hotel isn't it, but what it is is clean, well managed, convenient and perfect for anyone wanting to be close to everything. There were tons of actvities within walking distance and easy access to most sites. The free parking was great and it was nice to know we always had a spot. The free treats for breakfast were appreciated and the management was always available with a friendly smile. Varsa did a great job arranging a tour and the management really went to bat for us when the tour group did not pick us up. They were on the phone immediately and made sure all of our needs we met. I highly recommend this spot as an affordable and convenient place to spend the night when in San Fran.

<Content>I will always stay here while in San Fran This hotel was amazing. Before I even got there I wanted to write a grand review. Varsa handled my reservation and was also on duty for the 3 nights me and my boyfriend stayed there, and she was extremely helpful from the first time I called to the time of checkout. We did not experience any problems while there. In fact, on the first day we returned to our room and the cleaning staff had left our window open to air the room out (screen was closed, though), so we went to the front desk to request that they not do this (just our own preference), and it was immediately put on the cleaning staff list of special instructions. Needless to say, the window was never left open again. The accommodations were perfect. If you're expecting rose petals in your bathroom and a foot massage with bon bons upon awakening, you a) may be spending too much time in your room anyway, but b) should look elsewhere, because these accommodations are great for people who want a good, safe, convenient location with good service (the fridge and microwave were a definite plus). If you're looking for the latter, then book here. The free parking was EXCELLENT. Buyer beware - if you think you're getting a bargain at some of the other hotels which do not have free parking, think again. You could pay upwards of $25+ per day for parking alone, and even more if they don't grant you in-and-out access during the day. Do the math and in most cases you'll probably come out dollars ahead if you stay here instead. There were some great restaurants in the area (Aroma Cafe and the Bagelry are worth special mention...and you MUST go to Firefly which is all the way across town but well worth it), as well as a Walgreens literally just around the corner (at the time of this review) in case you forgot something. For those who might be a little swayed by the one unsatisfied reviewer who complained that this hotel isn't as close to the Wharf as advertised, I'd say this -- downtown San Fran is not like Manhattan...it's pretty small and everything is fairly easy to get to. It took us about 20 min by cable car, including the walk from the hotel to the stop and the trip down to the wharf. Plus you get some great photo ops (including Lombard's one crooked block) that way! And in terms of being told to hold it down, the sign for quiet hours is clearly posted...I'd want a hotel manager to do the same thing if there were guests disturbing my sleep even if they didn't mean to. Again, this hotel was fabulous. Thanks to Varsha and Sy for a wonderful experience. I'll be back whenever I come to San Fran next, and will gladly recommend you to everyone I know!

<Content>Excellent value We stayed at the Castle Inn for 6 nights in May and found that it was worthy of the good reviews we had seen on this site. Marshall, Arlene and Varsa were very friendly and helpful with suggestions and advice. The street map they gave us was very handy and helped us find our way around the city. The room was spotlessly clean and the beds were exceptionally comfortable. Our shower was really powerful and there was everything we needed in the room, fridge/freezer, iron and ironing board and microwave oven. Our room was one of the farthest away from the road and we weren't disturbed by traffic noise at all. The area was very convenient and we were able to walk to Fisherman's Wharf, (downhill all the way there, but not too bad on the way back) and Chinatown (steep hill but worth it for the view, or you can go through the tunnel instead).The breakfast was adequate for us and there are plenty of restaurants and shops nearby if you need more.If you don't need luxury you will find everything you need here with the bonus of having staff who make you welcome and will take time to answer your questions, advise and help you. It's also fantastic value, especially if you have a car as the parking is free.

<Content>Absolutely recommend I absolutely recommend the Castle Inn. We were really tired when we arrived there but we were given a fantastically friendly welcome and loads of helpful advice by the owner.The room was large, clean and comfortable. Although it wasn't fancy, as such, it had everything you could need (fridge, microwave, ironing board and iron) and was very quiet.Free parking was a bonus - the owners were very amenable, letting us leave the car when we checked out and come back for it a few hours later.By motel standards, the breakfast was good.All in all, I couldn't fault this place and for the price, it was fantastic.

<Content>Perfect Accommodation I just stayed here on my first trip to San Francisco, and it was perfect. The people on reception were very friendly and helpful, telling us which areas to avoid, and letting us leave a car on the day of departure while we went to Alcatraz in the morning. The room was very spacious and clean, with an ironing board, fridge and microwave for those more domesticated than me. The rooms are set back from the street and therefore quiet. Also, it's next to Van Ness Street - part of Highway 101, which leads south to the airport and north to the Golden Gate Bridge. It's great. I'd like to go back to SF, and I'd certainly stay here again.

<Content>A great place to stay! We spent three nights very comfortable nights at the Castle Inn at the beginning of April and would definitely recommend it as an excellent place to stay in San Francisco. The people at the front desk were very friendly and were happy to give advice about places to go and good restaurants in the area. We thought the location was very convenient - 10/15 minutes walk to Fisherman's Walf and near to bus and cable car stops (both of which were an excellent way of getting around, particularly if you buy a travel pass).

<Content>Very good value, good location Just returned to Australia and was pleased with the results from using TripAdvisor. One of the better rated hotels was the Castle Inn. First impressions were not great however when we opened the door we were very pleased. The room was a good size with 2 queen beds. The microwave and refrigerator were very useful but the bonus was the free parking. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and gave us a map showing the places to go and also not to go. The walk to the sights was a good 10 minutes however walking back up the hills took a bit longer as should be expected. The Castle Inn is located in a safe area and with 2 young kids we had no concerns in walking to nearby restaurants at night. All in all I have no hestitation in recommending the Castle Inn as a good place to stay.

<Content>Look No Further..Stay At The Castle Inn! We just returned from 4 nights at The Castle Inn. For the budget minded traveler I can't recommend this place enough. It was everything we had hoped it would be.First and foremost the place was immaculate. I have stayed in far nicer hotels that weren't nearly as clean. Whether you were looking at the elevator, lobby area, common hallways, your room or bedding, everythingw as clean. Next, the hotel management was wonderful. Varsa was without a doubt the most accomodating person I've ever run across. She told us where to go, where not to go, and how to get there. She made dinner reservations for us, called cabs, booked tours, you name it. She was very personable and never made us feel badly for asking the same question more than once. (And trust me, we did!). She was always looking for feedback too, in terms of how we liked things, how we got around and so forth. She is obviously very dedicated to the success of The Castle Inn and it shows.Some folks have complained about the breakfasts. We found no problems whatsoever. Each day there was a choice of prepackaged breakfast bars, packaged muffins or pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit and coffee/tea/hot cocoa. It was more than enough to jump start our morning and energized us to begin our walks. If you are looking for a sit down breakast you won't find it here but like I said, you certainly will find enough choices to hold you over until you find a restaurant. I liked the fact that we could grab a banana or two and hit the road.The room itself was more than fine. We had 2 queens and also a roll-away. I think we may have been put in a larger room to accomodate the roll-away. Varsa warned us that the roll away might not be comortable but honestly, at the end of each day I was so dog tired I could hav slept on a bed of nails. The room had a/c and windows that slide open to let in the fresh air. We were not bothered by the city noises at all. Did we hear them? Yes. But it's noises we'd expect to hear in the city and we got use to them quickly.The room also had a nice micro and fridge. There are plenty of restaurants around the corner so if you choose to do take-out you can safely store your food in your room. There is also a Walgreens just around the corner for water, soda or other munchies you might want to stock in your room. The tub/shower/toilet were separate from the bathroom sink which allowed us to save time and do things in tandem. There was also a hairdryer and full sized ironing board and iron in the room, which unfortunatley we did have to use even though I vowed I wouldn't iron on vacation. I loved the location of the hotel too. It took us about 15 minutes (pretty much all downhill) to get to Ghiradelli Square. North Beach was also not a bad walk. There were bus routes about 2 blocks away (also an easy walk). We loved all the neighborhood restaurants and cafes too. After staying here, I'd never want to stay in Fisherman's Wharf or Union Square.We had a very positive experience at The Castle and would highly recommend it.

<Content>Good Value, Great Neighbourhood As in San Fran week of April 3 to April 10th and we stayed at the Castle Inn. It truly was great value. The Inn staff was extremely helpful with where breakfast/dinner options in the neighbourhood, tour companies to use and places to go see ie. Wineries in Napa Valley. The rooms were basic but big compared to other hotels and you spend minimal time it doesn't really matter. Parking is included and that in itself is a hug help because even though everyone says you don't need a car in SF, we liked having it available to us to just drive to a neighbourhood and cruise around the less touristy places. The breakfast offered by the hotel (or any of the hotels, we also stayed at the Buena Vista Motor Inn as well) isn't much to talk about. Muffins and Danishes that are packaged (trans fats), cereal bars, bananas and apples (good) orange juice and coffee but it came in handy a couple of days.The location of this hotel is ideal. Very prominent homes nearby but it did feel like the streets were very steep in Russian Hill. Bus routes are extremely convenient. Hop on to the VanNess #47 to get to Fisherman's warf and downtown. Polk St right by the hotel has a Bagel shop for a breakfast on the run and Polker for a sitdown breakfast - you must try the Skillet with sausage. Stay away from Market St. and the Tenderloin area...seedy part of town. There's lots to do in SF so have fun.Cathy, Hamilton, Ontario

<Content>A nice place to stay This was a nice stay in San Francisco, the hotel was within walking distance to many of the sites, although at the top of one of the many hills ! Our room was basic but clean and had everything you would need for a short stay. We found the hotel staff very helpful in telling us where to and not to go while we were there. Breakfast is basic - a cup of coffee and a cereal bar/muffin if you're lucky to get there early enough !! Free parking was a great bonus.We had no problems at all and would stay again.

<Content>Great value. Rude front desk. We also read the great reviews and value and booked one night after spending two nights in Napa. We had a very limited time to take in the sights so were disappointed to arrive at 3:45 to a note taped to the office door Be back in a minute. Almost 15 minutes later (We almost left them a note and headed out.) she arrived. When our credit card was run during check-in, my husband inquired the rate b/c we prepaid using hotels. Instead of explaining it's a deposit for phone use, she replied, I don't know what you paid. You used the internet. Okay . . . The rooms were standard, roomy, and pretty close to everything although a bit farther from the Warf than posted. Our bad experience happened when we returned from dinner and a jazz club (and a LONG walk!) as we walked to our room. We were talking about people we had met out and stopped to get a Sprite out of the machine. We were almost to our door and we heard yelling but couldn't figure out who it was or where it came from. When we got to our door, I happened to glance over the railing to the parking lot, and there was the front desk lady in her bathrobe shouting up and waving her arms wildly at us! We had no idea what she was saying or why but couldn't believe she was actually screaming up at us. We are two 35 year-old parents of two toddlers, not 20 year-old wild spring breakers. I guess we should have kept our original reservation at the Argent but since our stay in San Fran was less than 24 hours, we tried to save money.

<Content>Excellent! This hotel is simply perfect if you want comfort and luxury while travelling on a budget in this beautiful city. Marshall and Adrianna are great hosts, who know absolutely everything about the city and will do whatever they can to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The rooms are clean, big and in ' motel-style' and have excellent facilities, like a microwave, coffeemaker and huge comfortable beds. There is also free wireless internet. Moreover, the hotel's location is great, close to the Russian Hill Neighbourhood and on walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf and downtown. This hotel is what I would call value for money. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who is planning a trip to San Francisco and I will definately come back myself!

<Content>Thank you Castle Inn! Stayed here 28th-31st March. Great value motel/inn in a fantastic location, everything is within walking distance The rooms are spacious and clean (4 of us) and I have never met more friendly and helpful staff. Although on a busy street and outside corridors I felt extremely safe and secure (there is a narrow frontage so most rooms are tucked behind the main street), the free parking was a definite bonus.We fell in love with San Francisco and would definitely stay at the Castle again, as well as recommending it to anyone.

<Content>Thumbs Up! Great value. No Surprises. We stayed at the Castle Inn from March 18 - 20th, 2005. Going in, we were nervous--knowing it was a very low priced hotel. We booked it based on reviews on this website and crossed our fingers. We were pleasantly surprised! It comfortably provides the basic necessities and no unpleasant surprises. Our kids loved the free hot chocolate in the lobby. The free parking is a must in this crowded town.

<Content>Great place, great location We stayed here 4 night all together, and will definitely stay there again if/when we return to San Francisco. We dealt with several different members of staff, and they were all extremely helpful. The rooms are large and very clean. The location is excellent, only a 15 minute walk from e.g. Chinatown, and in a safe, nice area with loads of eateries (those recommended by the staff were excellent).

<Content>Good location, parking, not much else We stayed at this hotel and had a great time in San Francisco. The free parking offered by the hotel was great, as was the free wireless internet and the central downtown location.In my opinion there were more negatives though. The place is really no more than a motel. The rooms are nothing special and since we stayed on the third and top floor all the heat from other rooms seemed to rise into ours and it felt like a sauna no matter how low we turned the air. The free breakfast was also appalling and consisted of no more than vending machine-style muffins and fruit.If you are looking for something convenient and cheap then the Castle Inn is definitely your place; but if you are willing to spend slightly more money for a nicer stay, then you should definitely look elsewhere.

<Content>Great place, great staff Just a quick word to thank you so very much for your help prior to our trip to SF. You run an excellent hotel. The rooms are, as you told me, very clean indeed. I am so pleased that we decided to stay with you as you are ideally placed for getting around the city. The free parking is a fantastic bonus. I will not hesitate to stay with you again when we return, as we surely will, to the City: nor will I hesitate to recommend you to everyone I talk to. The upgrade to a suite on our last night in the city, after our return from Lake Tahoe, was a beautiful gesture.Many, many thanks.Barry  Lidia (Goosnargh, UK)

<Content>Ideal location I was @ Castle Inn from March 11 through 17th along with my wife and daughter. we had a wonderful time in SF and Castle Inn made it even better. I booked us for 6 nights based on the reviews i read here. We ready had no idea what to expect but we were not disappointed. The poeple who run the place Marshal and his wife are very nice poeple. The motel itself is very clean and rooms are larger than you expect. Furthermore, it is very quiet and the location is absolutely wonderful. Hotels in SF are very expensive and the rate for this motel is very reasonable. The only draw back about this motel is the parking. Although, it is free but extremely tight. I would not recomand to drive a SUV or a big truck there. However, it is ok for small cars. I will most likely stay @ Castel Inn next time i am in SF.

<Content>Great place to stay We just returned from our 2 week stay at the Castle Inn and we had a great time. I had picked out a different hotel but based on the reviews I read about the Castle Inn we changed our minds - and I am glad we did so. It was our first time in San Francisco and the staff had very helpfull recommendations where to go and how to get there. The room was spacious and very nice. The bed was comfortable and I think it is nice that they have a coffee-maker, microwave and refrigerator in the room. Free parking and newspapers in the morning was also great. The hotel is situated in a nice neighbourhood with very good restaurants, bars and shops just around the corner. I would definetely stay there again and will recommend it to all my friends.

<Content>Ideal Location We stayed at this hotel in February for a five day girls weekend. It was a great place to stay and I would recommend it to others. The biggest thing this place has going for it is its location. It's right off Polk Street, which features tons of trendy bistros and cafes. It's also only two blocks from the cable cars and close to major bus routes. We didn't rent a car and the only time I wished we did was when we saw Lombard street (the crookedest street) because I wanted to drive down it! We did a lot of walking and were glad we had come prepared with good sturdy shoes. The room was clean, the continental breakfast was adequate, the room felt safe and the front desk was always a good source of information. This hotel is in between Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square - we debated whether we would have been better off getting a hotel in Union Square to be close to theatres, etc at night but I enjoyed being in a residential location.

<Content>Great - except for the street noise Based on Trip Advisor reviews, I booked a five-day stay here in early February. The hotel lived up to its billing -- except for the street noise. My room was as far back from the street as it got, and I still heard motorcycles and cars gunning down Broadway at all hours of the night. Other than that, I have only praise for the hotel. You can't beat the price; after tax, I paid $90/night through Orbitz. The hotel was not just clean but fastidiously so; an employee was out sweeping the sidewalk in the early morning. The room was quite large, especially since I was traveling solo. I felt very safe; the garage was especially well secured with alarms and cameras. The staff handled my every request before and during my arrival without hesitation: late checkout, receipt of faxes and packages, etc. The free parking was wonderful. And the location was fantastic. Broadway and Van Ness are convenient thoroughfares for getting around town, and there are lots of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. (Check out the great wine bar at the back of William Cross Wine Merchants - 2253 Polk Street. Say Hi to Jeremy, the owner, for me!) Overall, a good budget hotel for exploring the city!

<Content>Not bad, not bad... Stayed at the Castle Inn the night of March 7th, 05. Chose it based on the many reviews it has received on this site. Needed a place to crash after the Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy concert. Nice little motel, quite good for the money. I'm not too picky about things, so the Castle Inn pleased me.Pros:-Queen Bed-TV-A/C-Microwave-Mini Fridge-Very clean room-Shower was very clean, water temp was perfect, shower head had good pressure.-Iron and Ironing Board (Girlfriend loved that)-Free Parking (everywhere else charged $25 extra! The parking garage is quite small, I sort of had a hard time maneuvering my little hatchback around in it.)-Less than a block from Walgreens!-Lady at front desk helping with directions (even though she was off by a couple blocks on the destination. No big deal. Nice of her to help!)-Low Price! (about $75!)Cons:-Pillows and bed were hard. I wasnt bothered by it too much, but my girlfriend is picky about what she sleeps on.-Only got two matchbook size bars of soap and two small lipstick size tubes of shampoo for two people to shower and wash with.-TV remote didnt work. No biggie.-Too few towels. Towels were sort of rough.-All the fruit was gone from the Continental Breakfast-Could hear neighboring rooms' toilets flushing during the night. Woke me up a couple times.I'd definitely consider staying at the Castle Inn again, especially if the prices stay the same. Nice room for the money!

<Content>This place is Not overhyped! Like so many others we based our stay here on the excellent reviews - and were not disappointed. The room was a good size and very clean. The hotel was in a good location, within walking distance of Fishermans Wharf, and the free parking was indeed an added bonus. During our 2 week stay in the States the staff at the Castle were the most friendly and informative that we met out of all the hotels we stayed in. Nothing was too much trouble for them, they made excellent restaurant recommendations and even phoned out for pizza for us! I concur that you could here street noise from your room - but hey - you're in the middle of a busy city! I would highly recommend this place, especially if you don't know the city as the hosts will tell you what's good and what's not.

<Content>Nice inexpensive stay We had a reservation at another hotel for our one night stay in San Francisco but we can in a day early and our hotel couldn't accomodate us. They referred us to the Castle Inn. We were very happy with our stay at the Castle Inn, the room was clean, the bed comfortable and yes, the free parking was great (some hotels charge 28$/day just for parking). The bathroom probably needs a little renovation (the paint in the bath was peeling) but it was clean.The young lady at the counter, Varsa, was very nice. She gave us a map and recommended a great seafood restaurant ( Hyde Street Seafood and Grill). She helped us with our internet problems (so did her husband). The breakfast offered many choices (danishes, muffins, doughnuts and even fruits) they also had orange juice (thank you for thinking about the non-coffee drinkers!) We will recommend this place to all of our family and friends.

<Content>Great Motel The Castle Inn in San Francisco is an excellent location within walking distance of China Town, North Beach, the Embarcadero, Fisherman's Wharf, Russian and Nob Hills, Union Street area, and much more !Not only that, the rooms are very comfortable, with all the amenities, and the managers, Marshall and Arlene are extremely personable and helpful. I travel extensively and very rarely, if ever, come across managers so informative and entertaining to boot - They are one of the most enjoyable couples I've met in the myriad of motels I've visited.

<Content>Great Value We came to the Castle Inn as our home away from home while in SF on business for a week. It's a great value for the price. It's not fancy, but it's clean and safe, and has great perks like free wireless internet throughout the hotel, free parking, and a fridge and microwave in the room. We'll stay there again!

<Content>Keep In Mind As others, I did see the positive reviews for the Castle Inn. I thought I'd give it a try, booking it through Orbitz, based on the Orbitz three-star rating it had at the time. I would just like people to have realistic expectations of this property. This is a two-star motel, not a three-star hotel (like the Holiday Inn at Fisherman's Wharf). It has exterior corridors. The room was spacious and clean, but the room I was assigned smelt of cleaner, and it definitely had a motel-type feel to it. Free parking is a big deal in San Francisco. However, the motel's parking is cramped, and I wouldn't advise parking a SUV there (at least not for the faint of heart). The staff was extremely nice, so I feel bad not writing a glowing review as so many others did here.  If you're looking for value in a property situated in town, and you don't mind a motel, than consider the Castle Inn. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere. If you look hard enough, you can get a main chain three-star hotel for just a bit more per night. The Castle Inn wasn't anything exceptional. My main problem with the property was that it was billed as something more than it was -- a motel.

<Content>A gem of a place! We booked our room after reading so many great reviews. We were only able to stay one night, but we are glad we did. The hotel was clean and well located for where we were going. The staff was great - we arrived a little early and our room was not quite ready, but they held our bags for us and off we went. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and quiet. And the free parking was a wonderful bonus.We will always look to this hotel when we go to the city.

<Content>A Mom and Pop Gem for City Folks Stayed two nights in January, '05 during perfect sunny weather. This older property has been meticulously renovated with quality materials and attention to detail (e.g., crown moldings in main room and patterned tile work in bath), even though choice of colors and materials of drapery/decor could have been better handled. Not tacky, just off in taste and execution a bit. But you forget about that when you experience how well-managed the hotel is and how great a location the Castle occupies for forays into San Francisco and surrounding environs. The hotel structure's layout is a brilliant urban solution, as the building is slotted into its space on Broadway with three tiers of rooms all facing West, with two levels of parking off the street. The front desk is up one level from Broadway and controls (more or less) ingress and egress to the elevator, stairs, and upper garage (I'd say, as a New Yorker/LAXer, that it's a good security arrangement). Rearward rooms are quieter with stairs there. The third floor view picks up a lovely old grey stone church directly and in the distance the upper sections of the Golden Gate Br. can be seen. The district the Castle is situated in abounds in great prepared food (try Pesce for nouveau Italian tapas and Polkers for great breakfasts and burgers), wine and liquor shops, fresh fruit, coffee, conveniences, and general down-to-earth S.F.-style residential living; the Castle is within walking distance to other areas of interest, and of course the buses and cable cars are right there too. I didn't bother with the rental car in S.F. Managers Arlene and Marshall are charming, knowledgeable, humane, no-nonsense hotel professionals and San Franciscoans who welcome mature, city-savvy, responsible guests looking to explore and enjoy one of the world's great metropoles and regions. If that's you and co., you'll appreciate this uber-urban, basic, but in what it offers, high-quality and smart guest house.

<Content>Excellent hotel Yep, I have to agree with all those folks who gave the Castle Inn 5 stars. Spacious rooms, clean and tidy, and modern furnishings in excellent condition. No noise or security problems. Central location in a decent neighbourhood, and pretty close to just about anywhere you might want to go. Walgreens just around the corner for all your bits and pieces, and you can catch the 49 and 47 buses (to get you to Market Street) two minutes from the hotel. Very friendly and helpful folks on the front desk. And very reasonably priced. Overall, excellent value for money and highly recommended.

<Content>Fantastic hotel I stayed here for 4 nights in mid December 04 and I loved the place. The free parking was fantastic, always a space and easy to get in and out of. The room was one a good size, the bathroom was a little old, but better than a lot of hotels I've been in (and they cost more). The room was quiet, we heard a little noise from people walking by the door as it's an outside corridor, but not enough for it to bother us. The windows also opened up which is rare for a hotel, but great for fresh air. The staff were SO helpfull. They gave us a map and wrote down the places to avoid at night, the places to eat cheaply, where the laundry was, where Kinko's was, anything you needed to know they knew. The hotle is within walking distance of almost everything you want to see adn do, Fishermans Wharf, Pier 39, street cars, cafe's, bars, Wallgreens.Overall this was one of the best hotels I stayed in the US (we stayed in 9) and one of the cheapest. I would stay here again next time I'm in San Francisco and have told all my friends to stay here as well. Great hotel.

<Content>Happy with our stay in Castle Inn We are a group of 13 from Singapore. Our stay in Castle Inn had been very pleasant. Varsa was the most friendly  helpful host we met throughout our trip along Coastal California. The rooms were basic but very neatly  cleanly kept  quiet too. The rate was reasonable. Thanks Varsa for a great stay at San Francisco.

<Content>More than pleasantly surprised This November my wife and I decided to drive up the coast to San Francisco. We did not make reservations and decided to take our chances. Walking around the Fisherman's Wharf we decided to check out the accommodations recommended at the California Welcome Center. We were directed to a wall with listings of accommodations and a phone to call them. We tried a couple of places but no luck or they did not sound good. The fellow in attendance said for us to try the Castle Inn as he had heard good things from others about it. The person answering the phone I believe was Marshall. He began to tell me how wonderful the Castle Inn was. He kept telling me and telling me and telling me all the wonderful things about the Castle Inn. He'll probably remember this but I had to yell at him to shut up ;) so I could make a reservation. Well I made the reservation and we made our way to the Castle Inn. To say we were pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. Everything he said that was good about the Castle Inn was true and then some. On their business card it states Great Location, Great Room, Great Service. True, True, and True. Plus what a terrifically nice couple for hosts. I did not get their names but on the business card it says Marshall and Ariene. I assume they were the ones I dealt with. They were very helpful and more than accommodating.  If we are in San Francisco again we most certainly stay there and we will wholeheartedly recommend Castle Inn to others. The location was quite close to the trolley cars and easily accessable.

<Content>Pros and cons Decided to discover San Francisco during it's low peak season which is during the holidays. SF is beautifully decorated during this time too. We stayed 3 nights on early Dec. Got a great deal from --------------. Pros :- Price : it was about $60 for a king-sized bed with amenities like a fridge, m/w and FREE parking.- Location : it had some interesting places to see around it like the Haas-Lilenthal house and Spreckel's Mansion (Danielle Steele's house). It's also a few blocks away from Union Street which is all lighted up for the holidays. Octagon House is on this street corner too. Walk around Polk St to find interesting shops and breakfast places. For the discerning Muslim eaters, there is a Halal Deli nearby too. Last but not least, Walgreens is half a block away.- Common sense deposit : the deposit was $25. I thought I was hearing things.- Public transportation : easy walk to bus and cable car lines.- Room : Clean room. Had a nice fragrant smell when we checked in. TV with a VCR. Had a nice little breakfast table in there. It's really a spacious room and I think recent furniture. This was on the first level so below us was the parking lot and the rooms face some buildings. The good part about that is that we don't face the main road so practically no noise at night. The only noises came from the common coridor when people pass by, and we have an adjoining room so we hear them even though it's locked. Hardly hear the people from upstairs though. Lots of light.- Bathroom : Good water pressure and very clean. Good light.- Good communication : I e-mailed them to ask to inquire about my room and the response was quick and informative. I had requested a top floor room and a king size bed but only got the king size bed as the rooms I book was specially reserved for the travel company I used. However, they gave me options for an upgrade if I needed more privacy. I chose to stay with the room I got just to see what it's like (which I'm quite pleased with).- Vending machines : The drinks were $1 each. Cons :- Bathroom : It's really small and had brownish tiles which I'm not too keen of. It's a bit tight for me but good enough for a shower. If they are thinking of a renovation, I would suggest to increase the size a bit and change the tile colors to white. - Sink and closet area : This area looks like it belongs in the 70's (including bathroom). The closet rods are a bit rusted and the sink tiles are the same brown as the bathroom. Not much space to hang clothes but they had the luggage holder so I just used my bag to hold my clothes.- Towels : A bit rough and I guess it's a standard size for a bath towel but seemed a bit small for me.- Check-out time : I thought the check out time was 12pm but it's actually at 11am. Still, they gave a warning call which was really nice but still which I had the extra hour though. They didn't charge me the extra minutes I needed to pack.All in all, my husband and I are pretty happy with Castle Inn. It's not featured in most of the travel books we saw so it's good that we read about it here in tripadvisor. Have fun in SF!

<Content>Great Location This was the first time for us in San Francisco, and we didn't know where to stay. After reading many reviews on this web site, I came across the Castle Inn. I had a good feeling about this hotel. I had already made reservations with another hotel and cancelled them. I was glad that I did because the Castle Inn was much more convenient a location and very easy to get around in San Francisco from there. The trolley was up the street, the bus system picked up and dropped off at the corner. (Be sure to buy a muni pass, we rode all over the city using this pass, even though we had a car). Also there is no charge for your car. The room was clean and well kept. The desk personnel was very helpful. The only thing, I think they could expand on the breakfast goodies. Maybe more fresh fruit other than bananas. All in all we had a wonderful time and would stay there again.

<Content>Not a Bad on a Budget Normally I am a princess when it comes to staying in hotels; nothing short of luxury creeps me out. However, I was on a budget, and so I chose to stay at the Castle because of the rave reviews for this budget motel. I wasn't unimpressed, but I wasn't impressed either. The staff was extremely accommodating, and the parking was free, even after we checked out, which is huge in SF. The rooms were clean and comfortable, meaning I wasn't creeped out. Still, I knew I was staying in far less than a luxury hotel. But, if you are on a budget, The Castle is not a bad choice. (And centrally located)

<Content>GREAT CLEAN HOTEL We just got back from the best vacation ever. Staying at the CASTLE INN was the BEST ! We called ahead and updated to a King size bed and the room size was just right , and so was the matress. Versa and Sy were charming hosts and very helpfull about getting around S.F. We highly recommend the Thai Restaurant on the corner, and even though we had rolls and coffee with the room, the French Bakery two blocks from Castle Inn was our temptation for a bowl of Latte every day. While we were there the street at the corner had an open house and stroll for all the gift stores. We walked a few blocks to catch the cable car that took us everywhere in the city. We will definetly be back to stay at the CASTLE INN again and again.

<Content>The most wonderful owners We stayed at the Castle in on December 10th based on the reviews on this site. The hotel is very easy to find with easy and free parking (amazing in SF). The room was basic but very, very clean, spacious, quiet and had a large bathroom and even a mini fridge and microwave.What makes this place special, however, are the owners. We were considering a late night check-in so I called to ask how late we could arrive. Although their front desk closes at 11:00 PM, they were happy to accomodate us with a midnight check-in and, in fact, felt bad that we did not take them up on their offer to wait up for us. When we arrived we were greeted with the biggest smile and a very warm reception by Varsa - it felt like we were old friends coming for a visit. We were checked in quickly, given a map of the city with instructions on which areas to stay away from and directions on how to get to our restaurant. They only had a room for one night so Varsa made a call to get us into another hotel for the next night.In the morning, I came down to get some coffee and muffins and was asked how our evening had been, how we slept and then Varsa gave me a tray to carry breakfast up to our room. It is these very small and thoughtful details that make the Castle Inn special.We will most certainly be back on our next stay.

<Content>Great Stay at the Castle Inn! I would recommend staying at the Caste Inn to anyone traveling to San Francisco! The location was perfect, and I loved all of the little shops and restaurants in the area. The rooms were affordable, clean and cozy. Nothing spectacular, but the location makes up for it. Varsa was delightful...always offering up great suggestions! Affordable and highly recommended.

<Content>Great Neighborhood, Better Proprietor! I was attending a conference at the nearby Holiday Inn on California and Van Ness. Since the rate there was $40 a night more than the Castle Inn, I decided to spend three nights after the conference at the Castle Inn, based upon the recommendations posted here.Smart move! First, the co-owner, Varsa, is one of the nicest, helpful hotel operators I've ever met. She's definitely on par with the best BB proprietors I've encountered abroad. The hotel is budget-minded, so don't expect a breakfast spread or other luxuries. However, Varsa will give you a great orientation to the neighborhood and the public transportation system, which was much more helpful than what I got from the Holiday Inn. I only had a few days, but managed to navigate the public transportation system thanks to her help and cheat sheet on where to pick up the appropriate buses, etc.The room was spacious, clean and, for a room with a view of the road (Broadway), reasonably quiet. The TV had more cable channels than at the Holiday Inn, if that's important to you. It also had a fridge and microwave, which was a plus! However, no utensils, so bring your own bottle opener or corkscrew.Which brings me to another big plus -- the neighborhood! This section of Nobb Hill is everything you'd want while on vacation. It's close to the bus, tram, and trolley lines. There's a Walgreens around the corner if you forget something, and a 24-hour Kinkos on Van Ness if you need to check your e-mail. There's a wine bar, a pub, and a great Thai restaurant, all within a block or so. There are plenty of coffee shops, and even a great crepe restaurant. Varsa is expecting baby #3, but if she's there, be sure to ask her for recommendations on where to eat, where to shop, etc.Also, if you need a transfer to the airport, Varsa will arrange it for you, even if you need to be picked up before the office opens at 7 a.m. (the bus costs $12 one way).You just can't beat the price, value, convenience, and location! I'll definitely return next time I visit the Bay area.

<Content>We loved the Castle Inn Our two-night stay at the Castle Inn was perfect. Located in a spot convenient to just about anywhere you'd want to go without being in a high tourist area. We felt safe walking the streets. If you have a rental car (we did) there's free covered parking which is a huge plus. The rooms were immaculate, spacious and really perfect for anybody's needs. The free wireless internet access was another definite plus. This hotel is also an exceptionally priced value. I've stayed at the Mark Hopkins before and this hotel was much nicer just because of the personal service that the staff provided. Varsa was the most accomodating person that I have ever met. Upon check in she gave us a great map and marked several areas of interest along with a list of what transportation takes you where and where you can catch it along with the costs. She made you feel as though you were a guest in her own home instead of just a weary traveler. Her kindness is enough to make us want to stay there again the next time were are in S.F.

<Content>Look No Further If you are on a budget and want to stay at a clean, quiet, friendly motel, with free covered parking in a nice neighborhood, call Varsa at the Castle Inn to make your resos. Even if you're not on a budget, this is a great little motel.My mom, sister, 18 year old niece and I stayed here for four nights over the Thanksgiving holiday and were very pleased. Varsa is so helpful and was able to grant every request that I threw at her...cork screw, dinner reservations, which bus to catch, even directions to the METALLICA concert!!!! You rock Varsa. I will definitely return to the Castle Inn on my next visit to SF.

<Content>Great Location  Stayed at the Inn for six nights during Thanksgiving weekend. First the owner, Varsa, was extremely pleasant and helpful with directions, transportaion schedules and recommendations. The second thing I noticed is that the grounds and rooms were spotless. Third, the location is great for getting to the areas one is most likely to visit and fourth, if your rent a car the parking is free! What a plus. The value is great for what you will receive. When I return to SF in the future, I will definitely stay at the Castle Inn.

<Content>Perfect SF motel The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious, and, above all, Varsa is everything you would hope for in a hotel manager. In fact, you feel more like a guest than a customer with the numerous ways in which she takes the trouble to help you. Breakfasts may be uncooked, but you can actually have a totally healthy breakfast (fresh orange juice with pulp, fresh fruit and healthy granola bars with coffee/tea), and since the rates are low with free parking and wireless internet, if you want more food, you can try the many excellent cafes on Polk Street. Unbeatable value, and in an extremely convenient location for driving, and walking to Fisherman's wharf, and public transport everywhere else. Maybe I should have kept this a secret treasure!! :-)

<Content>A Hidden little gem! The staff at the Castle Inn were really helpful! Before my stay I need to get some packages delivered to me in the United States and the staff were obliging with the packages waiting for me when I arrived. The rooms were large and bright and well maintained and had very large beds. The wireless internet access was a welcomed added bonus!Overall the hotel is in a great location and is not in a tourist hotspot and is easy to get to!

<Content>Excellent stay! My husband, daughter, and I stayed at the Castle Inn for 2 nights last month. The service there was fantastic. We got great food recommendations (Versa even made reservations for us and called us when we were out and about sightseeing to let us know what time they were for!) and plenty of help with directions and suggestions for what to do and see. The rooms were perfectly adequate, clean, and comfortable. The only down side to our stay (and it was a small one) is that they don't have cribs there. Even still, we would stay there again without hestitation. Great service, great location, free parking ... great stay!

<Content>ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! We chose this hotel based on the reviews we read here and we were definitely not disappointed. First off, easy to find. Second...CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN...and top that with LOCATION! On our first trip to San Francisco we were 4 women on a California Adventure. We felt very safe and we never had to use our rental car. Public transportation is abundant and nearby. Great restaurants nearby and Walgreens located very close for any incidentals you may have forgotten at home. What we most loved about Castle Inn were the incredibly friendly and warm hosts, Varsa and Sy. Varsa provided us a warm welcome and smile every morning when we went to grab our breakfast. What a great way to start our day. The price was right on...Very Quiet location and the accommodations were very comfortable. A great added touch is a large refrigerator and microwave in the room. I've told my family and friends about Castle Inn and I hope that everyone who reads this will choose this hotel.

<Content>Great place to stay Stayed at the Castle Inn for 4 nights from August 4 2004 - on our family trip of a lifetime!! We chose the Castle Inn based on reviews from this site - and we were so pleased we did.....it is a great place to stay for discovering San Francisco. Our room was extremely clean - if you are looking for a 4/5 star hotel, then this is not the place - but, if you are looking for a friendly welcome, clean rooms, all at a good price, then we thoroughly recommend this place. My two kids were enamoured with Marshall and his advice of where and where not to go (!) .....and they loved the danish pastries/cereal bars which we grabbed to go each morning. Very happy memories of San Francisco ....... let's hope we can come back soon! Thanks Marshall and Arlene, from the Webb family.

<Content>Very Pleased. We stayed at the Castle Inn from October 18 - 22 2004. We booked a room here based on reviews we read on TripAdvisor. Coming from a small city to a large area like San Francisco, we were stepping outside our comfort zone so one of our main concerns was finding a safe place to stay in a safe neighborhood. A second concern was finding a reasonably priced hotel which would allow us to spend our extra cash on tours, attractions, restaurants - in short, on experiencing the city. The Castle Inn exceeded our expectations in both areas. We felt safe, and we were able to stay four days in a clean, comfortable, reasonably priced hotel. We walked EVERYWHERE from this hotel - Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, the Trans America Building, Coit Tower, Lombard Street, the Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Point, and the Golden Gate. Granted, some of these were rather long hikes, but we were still so pleased not to have to worry about transportation and really experience the city on foot.We enjoyed meeting and talking to Arlene, Marshall, and Varsa. In particular, we appreciate the extra work that Varsa went to in booking us a deluxe city tour with Alcatraz, and in booking us a shuttle back to the airport at the conclusion of our stay.We absolutely intend to visit San Francisco again, and we'll be booking at the Castle Inn for sure.

<Content>Great Location My partner and I visited San Francisco in April 2004. First let me say we love San Francisco! And what made the visit so much more fantastic was the hosts and owners of Castle Inn. They were very helpful and directed us to many interesting places in San Fran. Castle Inn has a great location. Only 20 minutes to the Bay and lovely places to eat within walking distance. When we visit again, Castle Inn will be the place we go. Most importantly, the beds are reeeeally comfortable and thats important when you stay away from home!

<Content>Great Location, Great Place, Great Staff I recently returned from a trip to San Francisco (9/16 to 9/21). I traveled with a close friend and we stayed at the Castle Inn. We got a bargain on our airfare and we also wanted a reasonably priced hotel. After all, we wanted to spend our money on tours and food etc. The Castle Inn was perfect! It was clean. It was safe. It was in a great area and not TOO many tourists. It was reasonably priced and we had no complaints what-so-ever. AND we had a gentleman next to us with 3 young boys. He was so concerned that we were hearing their noise. We never did! But above all else, the staff was just wonderful. The receptionist (owner) at the front desk could not be more gracious or helpful!! She provided the most useful information and she wanted to share with us all the sites of San Francisco that SHE found so wonderful. That was one pretty special lady.And, if she is reading this, what was the name of that place on POLK with the wonderful breakfast ??Just a nice little neighborhood 'joint' that, in addition to a wonderful breakfast, also had great people waiting on you! What a perfect start to our long days!

<Content>Location,price  I booked the hotel based on the reviews on this site and was not disappointed. The area is great and is safe-there are some nice bars and restuarants on Polk St just around the corner and you can walk to the Wharf(downhill all the way!). The hosts could not be more helpful and offered maps,tips,areas to go.avoid etc. The price of this hotel in SF is hard to beat and you wil not be disappointed if you stay here-the rooms are big spotlessly clean and comfortable. San Francisco is a great city so come here to stay and the money you save will pay for Alcatraz,etc.We will definitely be back.

<Content>Great choice We chose Castle Inn based on reviews read here and price and crossed our fingers. What a happy surprise! Our room was super clean, nicely accomodated, and quiet. Versa(sp?) was as billed- very helpful with maps, suggestions. You are within easy walking distance of the cable cars. We walked to the wharf-it's all downhill. Best of all-free, covered parking!! We'd stay there again.

<Content>Loved it We recently stayed at the Castle Inn, from the 22nd of Sept. to the 26th. Just wanted to let every money conscious traveler know that your well earned dollars stretch out very well here. Convient Bus, and cable car routes, and the Inn keepers (both Varsa and Sai), give the phrase going out of their way a whole new meaning. Rooms are comfy, and have everything that you need (fridge, micro, chairs, table....tv if ya need one). You definitely get a taste of the real San Francisco, yet are close enough to the attractions. Would highly reccomend to all.

<Content>We made a great choice in the Castle Hotel Early in August I took my nephew to San Francisco. After reviewing many hotels on the internet, I chose the Castle based on the number of favorable reviews. We were not dissappointed. It is not the Hilton, but then we are not Hilton people. Our hosts, Matthew and Arlene, were absolutely the best tour guides you could hope for. They knew when it was easier to take the bus, a car, or just walk. Matthew was instrumental in getting us tickets for Alcatraz, as we were silly enough not to purchase in advance. The location could not be beat. We walked almost everywhere and late at night, too. Never did we feel unsafe. When it was easier to take a bus, one on the main bus lines was just around the corner. We drove down and parking was included in the more than reasonable price (for San Francisco). A small breakfast was included with the room. Which, by the way, was clean and included a small fridge, coffee maker, and hair dryer. As you can see, I have no problem recommending the Castle. I'm only sorry I did not have time to write my review previously.

<Content>met my expectation I chose to stay at this hotel because of all the excellent reviews I read at tripadvisor. I am not sure whether all the excellent reviews are *real*, however what I can say is that - this inn is average and - the inn has met my expectation. * STAFF - excellent - friendly staff* LOCATION - average - Definitely NOT walking distance to the wharf or Chinatown. You won't want to walk it, even the 2.5 blocks to the cable car are long and steep. I drove around the city, so it was not a probably for me.* SAFETY - average - the area seems relatively safe. However, I am a bit uncomfortable with the fact that anyone can take the elevator or stairs up/down without passing through the office or front entrance. And the main office closes at 11pm. * AMENTITIES - average - towels are clean, but feel a bit used. The frig, microwave are pluses!!!* HOUSEKEEPING - excellent - room is very clean.* PRICE - excellent ($85 weekday, $95 weekend)* PARKING - excellent - it's free. It's a bit tight getting in and out, but hey, it's free!* BREAKFAST - OK - nothing to rave about, they serve packaged pastries and granola bars! The only good thing I got was a banana.

<Content>Cozy Stay at the Castle My husband and I just returned from 5 nights at the Castle Inn. We booked our stay based on comments off this site, and were so glad we did!! The hotel was perfect in everyway. The hosts Varsa and Sy were so helpful with directions and anything we needed. The location of the hotel is perfect right in the middle of everywhere you want to go, by foot or by bus. And most important we felt very safe in the neighborhood. Free parking a huge plus, as some hotels charge upwards of $20 a day. The rooms are clean, and have everything you need. Also, the hotel was full the majority of our stay and we didn't even know, as we never heard other guests or were bothered by any noise.We can't wait to visit again!!

<Content>Great Place to Stay! My husband and I just returned from a trip to San Francisco and a 4-night stay at Castle Inn. We were amazed at the friendliness and helpful suggestions given to us by the innkeeper. She told us about wonderful nearby restaurants; she gave us perfect directions; she told us exactly what areas of the city to avoid; and she gave great suggestions on things to do while we were there. The rooms were perfectly clean! They were standard motel rooms - no frills or thrills - but perfectly clean! I have stayed at hotels and resorts much more expensive that were not this clean. The location is wonderful. It feels safe and has great restaurants within easy walking distance.Our only issue was that doors are not sealed tight, so the smoke from people smoking outside our room came inside the room. We definitely recommend Castle Inn!

<Content>Clean, Comfortable, Great Price My husband and I researched many hotels before deciding on the Castle Inn for our vacation in late May 2004. We were very pleased with our choice. The room was simple and clean. It is in a great location, walking distance to many nice restaurants. Standing outside our room we could even see the top of the Golden Gate Bridge. The staff was friendly and helpful; they provided great insider info on places to see and places not to see. They also helped us plan our excursion tours, which we enjoyed very much. We recommend this hotel to our family and friends.

<Content>Bravo! What a little gem. San Francisco is a very expensive city. We located this on Trip Advisor and based on reviews booked it. We stayed here for two nights on 9/17  18, 2004. What was most impressive was the hospitality of the managers (Varsa and Sy)! What a welcome...so helpful! They provided great information about how to get around the city and where to go. The room was big...somewhat older building...very clean! Good shower (that's always important); however, bathroom was small. Not a bad distance from the warf...we walked it up and back (however, we're in pretty good shape). We even walked to the cable cars to take down to the warf. Found a nice little Italian restaurant around the corner Little Joe's -- good eats for small change. Overall, I would highly recommend Castle Inn -- Good price for location and clean. Further, the hosts are exceptional! You can tell this is a small place - 24 rooms I believe - and personal service.

<Content>Great SF Home Base!!! We stayed here for two nights during the week and were very satisfied with the room. The rooms are clean and basic, and included a fridge and microwave. Also, included each morning was a small continental breakfast available at the office. And, to my surprise, the friendly staff gave us some tourist advice! The big benefit to the Castle Inn was the free parking. Parking - a rare commodity in San Francisco. The secret to seeing San Francisco is using the public transportation. We left our car at the Castle Inn the whole time during our stay. The only issue with the Castle Inn is that it's not that close to the major attractions like Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf. It's walkable, but it would be a very long walk. But, you can get anywhere in the City by public bus - only takes a few minutes. We'll look forward to staying at the Castle Inn in the future! Bon Voyage!

<Content>Highly Recommend the Castle Inn Motel We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Castle Inn on our first trip to San Francisco. It was in a nice, non-tourist location. We had a nice clean room and the hotel clerk saved us a bundle on bicycle rentals. A good location for gawking at the mansions in Pacific Heights and a cheap cab ride home from Fisherman's Warf in the evening. The free parking was a great bonus. Would definitely stay there again !

<Content>Loved the Castle Inn! We stayed at the Castle Inn last week, on our first visit to San Francisco. We loved it! It was better than we expected for the money; nice, big room, tiles and heat lamp in the bathroom, great location, very clean, and the helpful man at the front desk told us where to go and where not to go. I did call ahead to ensure a non-smoking room, after reading one of the other reviews. I hope we can return someday!

<Content>The Castle Inn is a great find! We stayed 2 nights at the Castle Inn this past August, 2004. It is clean and well priced . Marshall, your host, can tell you exactly where to go and not to go in San Francisco. He also can send you to the best Chinese restaurant, which is just around the corner from the hotel. The rooms have a refridgerator/freezer,microwave,coffee maker, hairdryer,and iron/ironing board. There is air conditioning and an elevator, which you will be greatful for after walking up the big hills!The best thing is the entire hotel is non-smoking! We would definitely return to the Castle Inn!

<Content>Great location, friendly staff The Castle Inn is in a safe area that is not yet overrun by oodles of tacky tourist traps. We felt safe to walk around there in the evening with our daughter. There are great restaurants and cafes nearby where you can blend in with the locals. The variety of food on nearby Polk St. is astonishing from morning to evening. You are sure to find something to please everyone.The Inn is located a couple of blocks away from one of the cable car lines, and Fisherman's Wharf is a relatively short walk away. It's central, but not in a district where tourists are prey for panhandlers or pickpockets.It's a clean, inexpensive place to stay where the staff is friendly and helpful. One huge asset also is their parking, as this is not always easy to come by in SF.I definitely recommend the Castle Inn for price, cleanliness, location and safety.

<Content>Wonderful host. We booked this hotel on the recomendation after reading all the good reviews and the Castle Inn certainly deserves all it's star ratings.  We have travelled as a family around Europe and have been to USA 5 times and we have never met such a more friendly and helpful person as we did with Varsa the host/owner. The information such as the road map and bus map plus her wealth of knowledge of San- Francisco made our stay more enjoyable and easier, her help with our forgotten driving licence was excellent. The hotel is ideally situated to cover visiting all areas of San- Francisco, you do not need a car as public transport is only around the corner, cheap and easy to use. you can walk to most places if you want to such as China Town, Fishermans Wharf etc.  The rooms had everything they needed especially handy to have a fridge, micro-wave and the rooms were always cleaned every day. The breakfast was sufficient and enough with the friendly smile from the host to start the day. we can only make 2 slight criticisms, 1 room had an inter connecting door which made it noisier than it should have been and our teenage children thought the television reception could have been better, but not enough to make any difference to making it one of the most enjoyable hotel stays we have had on our holidays. Once again thank you Varsa for all your help.

<Content>It was great. We stayed 3 nights here in July. It has to be the best kept secret in San Francisco. The city bus line is a few steps away, the cable car line was 3 blocks away and there are several restaurants and other amenities in the near-by area. Parking provided the only concern in the under ground garage but that was due to the tight squeeze. Parking is free which is what you need in this city. The room was really great. We were there only to sleep and shower as there is so much to do in the city. Breakfast was fast and free and hit the spot. Varsa is an extremely friendly and helpful host. She obviously loves her job and steered us in the right direction. We found San Francisco to be very dirty and many of the people were rude and nasty. However it was nice to know that Varsa and the other staff at the hotel were friendly, courteous and just plain great.  We recommend this hotel very highly. It is not by the Wharf but then that is what makes this place a treasure.

<Content>Full marks for friendliness We stayed here in July at the beginning of our family trip to California, Nevada and Arizona. We stayed in 11 hotels and even though many of them were swankier, Varsa and Sy more than made up for it because they were just SO helpful and friendly (thank you!). Great location, clean, free parking and free breakfast. Enjoyed eating out at Polkers just round the corner. We wouldn't hesitate to return.

<Content>Excellent Hideaway in the Middle of the City Look no further - this is the place to stay in San Francisco! We just returned from a four day stay for our tenth anniversary. The price is VERY reasonable, especially for the location and service.The rooms were clean and spacious with a separate room with a (useful) fridge and microwave. They are within walking distance of Ghirardelli Square, Chinatown, Fishermans Wharf and close to both Muni and Cable Car stops. Sy an Varsa were very helpful - assisting us in picking the perfect place for a romantic dinner. The breakfast could have been a little more healthful, but nice that they have something available. If you are looking for a hearty breakfast try Bay Watch Restaurant (2150 Lombard Street - west of Van Ness near Filmore). If you have a car the free parking is a deal. For travel within San Francisco, you're much better off to leave your car parked and head out on foot or transit. We took BART and a Cable Car to and from the airport. If you want to use your credit card to purchase BART tickets you have to purchase them in $10.00 increments. Something I'm sure they do to screw tourists out of 10 cents each with a fare of $4.95 each way. Also, don't bother waiting in line at Powell Street Station (or any other starting point) for the Cable Car. Walk up a block or two and you will catch one much quicker. You can purchase a three day muni pass for $15.00 which is good on both muni buses and cable cars. Another word to the wise. If you ever find yourself needing to walk up an intense hill, walk a block or two in either direction and it's sure to be easier.Great City, Great Hotel, Great Service! While you're visiting the west coast, why not visit Vancouver too? You won't be disappointed.Brad  Karen

<Content>Great stay Stayed at the Castle Inn 28th July to the 4th August. We had an excellent stay here Hotel is in an ideal location, for exploring the city. Plenty of public transport locally and we felt safe walking to the some of the major attractions i.e. Fisherman鈥檚 Warf, China town, Lombard St, Union Sq etc. The hotel is very clean sheets changed every other day towels changed daily small breakfast offered every morning just right to get you started. We were a family of 4 in one room 2 Adults 2 Teenagers found to have enough room for us all especially liked the fact the wash basin was outside the bathroom so one could multi task. The room rate was excellent for this location in San Francisco you could pay far more and be worse off! The staff at the Castle were first class (Varsa for her help before our arrival with booking trips and advice and Arlene  Marshall at the front desk during our stay)

<Content>Clean, comfortable and in a great location The people at reception were very friendly and helpful, and the family suite we had was spacious. Our teenagers were fascinated by the numbers of people doing tai chi every morning outside the apartments opposite! This was a very good location from which to get around the city - we walked a lot. The neighbourhood felt very safe, and there were lots of good places to eat nearby, including a fantastic Cuban restaurant. The only San Francisco attraction we weren't too keen on was Fisherman's Wharf - it was heaving with people, and very tacky - even the sea lions had given it up for a bad job and left for the summer! Alcatraz was really interesting, with an excellent audio tour. We love San Francisco, and hope to return.

Everyone was exceptionally helpful- recommending restaurants, locating rental cars, giving directions,etc. The room was clean and comfortable. It is a great place to stay and I will definitely return!

<Content>Perfect and very lucky because of their help! When we came in San Francisco we needed a place to stay, and at that time it was the summerseason so a place to stay was hard to find. But luckily and thanks to the excellent help of the lady of the house, we could stay for 2 nights in a perfect Castle Inn. Perfect spot, near everything you need.Thanks guys, Greetings from Holland!Audrey en Arno Naafs

<Content>Pleasant stay at Castle Inn We choosed Castle Inn from AAA Tour Book because of it's location and free parking (free parking is a value in San Francisco) and stayed there for 3 nights in July (18-20). It turned out that Castle Inn was the best accomodation we had during our 3 weeks trip through California including higher priced sites.Besides the spacious (relative to SF), clean and functional rooms there was the great friendlyness and helpfulness we received from Varsa at the office, not to forget the hints and tips to explore San Francisco. We never before got a table with places of interest accompanied with the bus and tram numbers and advices how to reach them from the hotel, very helpful !We recommend Castle Inn as a best value stay in SF and would choose it again on our next visit to San Francisco.Reinhard Ries

<Content>Fabulous We stayed at this hotel 30 May to 2 June 04. This hotel is a little run down but what makes it so good are the little extras. We had a huge room and bathroom, a microwave, free breakfast and very friendly and helpful service. The owners showed us where to go and where to stay clear of. The hotel was also in a great position with buses on the corner. Would come back again with no hesitation. Loved it!!!

<Content>not as friendly as these posts elude Because of all the positive comments we had read here, we weren't too worried about our stay. Unfortunately, we were not very pleased. The place seemed a little run down and the staff was not friendly at all. The woman at the front desk didn't even greet us with a hello to us when we came into the front office...something you would expect if everyone proclaims they are friendly.In addition, when we met up with our friends and they helped us unload our luggage, the lady from the front desk ran out and confronted us about having extra people. We explained that they were our friends FROM SF there to show us around...only helping us carry our luggage. When we checked out the next day she yelled from the front office window at us, while we are on the street.... that she was charging us for extra people....and they did! However, only 2 of us stayed at the hotel!! So much for friendly staff! We've stayed in San Francisco before and I would recommend the Commodore Hotel or another Experience Rewards hotel in the SF area. Those were similarly priced, friendlier, and a better quality room for the money. I would avoid this place and would not go hear again.

<Content>Absoluteley superb We spent 8 days at the Castle Inn during June as part of our 6 weeks honeymoon of Hawaii and the west coast.This motel/hotel has very little to argue against it. In fact we could think of nothing! Location is superb, bus stop just out on Van Ness, and the Powell Hyde cable car route two blocks along Broadway. We were staying for a week, so we purchased a $20 transport pass from the fishermans wharf cable car turntable, and with the bus and cable car options close by, the hotel is extremely well located, and in a safe area. The Thai restaurant on the corner was great and cheap, get the takeaway and bring back to your room. The Star of India around the corner has a buffet for $8 which was the best Indian we've had in a while.Use the microwave to heat your left overs.Versa and the other staff are a wealth of information. If we ever come back to SFC, the Castle Inn will be our place to stay without question.David  Maria Burt, Wingan Way, Morwell Australia

<Content>Loved It! Was there for a weekend. It was great! Certainly the cleanest hotel I stayed in compared to even the Excalibur in Vegas. Versa was really helpful. It was very comfortable. I'm not saying it's 5-star, but you never need to question your choice. It's close to the bay. All in all, a really nice place to stay in.

We stopped over with our children on our drive home from Anaheim for two nights in June. The rooms are very clean, ten minute walk to fishermans wharf, in a safe neighbourhood. Again, the staff went above and beyond to help us with maps and tourist suggestions. They were all so friendly it felt like home!!

<Content>We'll return on our next trip to SF We stayed at the Castle Inn during our recent two day stay in SF, and it felt like our home away from home. First of all, we arrived on a late flight, getting into SFO at 11:15pm. I checked with them on the phone before hand to find out if we could check in that late. They said they normally closed at 11, but would be happy to wait for us, just that we call them when we arrive at the airport. It was around 1 am when we finally arrived at the hotel, and we were happily greeted with friendly and helpful service. One of my sons brought his laptop computer along and the next day, the proprieters helped him on his computer to get the wireless networking working correctly. She even called our room later to see how we made out and how things were working (they worked well.) We were also able to leave our car parked at the hotel while we toured SF mostly on foot. On our final day, even though checkout time was around noon, we were on the boat trip to Alcatraz until the mid afternoon, and our hosts said it would be no problem to leave our car parked at the hotel through the afternoon, until we were done so we wouldn't have to pay for parking around the wharf. If we return to SF, we'll return to the Castle Inn - nice people!

<Content>Great Hotel, helpful hosts. We booked the Castle online for two nights at the beginning of our trip, with the intention of staying somewhere else after a trip to Yosemite. We enjoyed the hotel so much we booked our remaining days after Yosemite while we were there. The desk staff were very helpful, even when they didn't have all our final nights free they phoned around and got us another hotel close by. (Luckily when we returned from Yosemite the room had become free anyway!).We couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough for location, comfort and friendliness - and free breakfast too.

<Content>Best Deal in SF I spent few days in San Francisco, me and my husband drove from San Diego to Alaska. When we stopped in SF, a local bus driver gave us the tip for this hotel.I was surprised by the location, very convinient walking distance to everything. The prices were great. And the best of all were Marshall and Arlene, the couple that manage the hotel. They are amazing, spent hours giving us the best tips how to enjoy the city and sharing all their road trip exeperinece what helped us a lot because was our first road trip.Excellent accomodation, I super recommend!!!

<Content>Castle Inn Makes You Feel at Home I've been staying at the Castle Inn for more than 20 years and have watched it continually improve.The new owners Versa and Cy, have added a touch of magic and the regular managers, Marshall and Arlene, are extremely courteous, helpful and informative.The Castle is also very conveniently located with real easy access to the colorful Polk Street area, North Beach, Chinatown, the Embarcadero and Fishermans Wharf.

<Content>Great Stay While this is obviously redundant to those who have read previous reviews, staff of the Castle Inn are absolutely the most friendly and helpful you will find anywhere. They take great interest in seeing that you have the best possible stay in San Francisco by giving helpful, up-to-date information, suggestions, etc. If you are looking for a great restaurant within walking distance of the Inn, they know them all. If you need directions to a far flung corner of the City, they will get you there. The Inn is clean and comfortable and within walking distance to China Town, Fisherman's Warf, cable cars, and other great places, so leave your car in the free parking lot provided. I have recommended the Inn to many and will continue to do so.

<Content>Not if it's the last hotel room on earth!!!!! We checked into the hotel for a Saturday Night stay after booking a non-smoking room on line. The clerk/ manager person was very curt and unfriendly to begin with. We went upstairs into a large and bright but somewhat shabby room which reaked of cigarette smoke. Calling downstairs the desk indicatated they had no other rooms but after some heated discussion they conceded they had a non-smoking room. (I got the sense that they have a distinct two -tier system where internet bookers are treated as 2nd class citizens) When I went to retrieve the key they reiterated the smoking preference was merely that and they rudely stated they had no such obligation to grant the preference. The new non-smoking room was fine though the walls were paper thin with a constant din of flushing toilets and footsteps on the ceiling. I have to say In probably 150 room nights spent all over the world I have never been treated so rudely by a hotel proprieter -ever. These folks have no concept of the term hospitality and if this is your only room option in San Fran I would reccommend sleeping on the street.

<Content>The Castle Inn was great! When making accommodation plans for a trip to San Francisco, we were looking for a moderately priced hotel in a good location. We booked three nights at the Castle Inn through Orbitz, with plans to spend three nights elsewhere. After reading the reviews of the Castle Inn, I thought we'd be making a big mistake to leave and proceeded to book an additional three nights by calling them directly. What a great place to stay. It's conveniently located, clean, the room is big enough that you are not constantly bumping into one another, the microwave and refrigerator were great to have, the mattress was comfortable, and with the fan constantly running, we never heard any outside noise. The best thing going were the hosts...they were wonderful. Most of our contact was with Varsa, but we also met Sy and Marshall. They never seemed to be bothered by our interruptions and questions. Their recommendations to the locals restaurants were right on! So, not only did we have a great room at a great price, but it seems as though we had our own personal assistants. When we said good-bye, it felt like I was saying good-bye to a friend. If our travels ever take us back to San Francisco, we wouldn't hestitate to stay at the Castle Inn again.

<Content>Friendly staff, good location While the facilities are quite standard (good sized, clean rooms) the excellent location and friendly staff give this hotel an edge. We stayed in Castle Inn for 3 nights and found it excellent - and one other bonus point came through the free parking.A reasonably priced, well located hotel.

<Content>Excellent value Spent three days at the Castle Inn, May 24 -27 and found it to be a good value. Rooms were well appointed with all the essentials for a tourist on the go including an iron and ironing board. Really clean...in fact, I don't think my bathroom is as clean as I found there. Tub and shower a might small but as with everything else, we were more interested in seeing the city then the walls of the room. Some noise from the street, but it didn't keep me from getting a good night's sleep. Staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and recommendations. Located within walking distance to restaurants, taverns, and a Walgreens on Polk Ave. Also about two blocks from a cable car stop and other mass transit near by.Overall, a fairly good stay. FYI: Mass transit is probably the best way to go for the majority of sightseeing, but you are best advised to be prepared for crushing conditions on some lines especially into Chinatown. Also, best to stay off during the school rush hour between 3 and 5 p.m. as we found some of the most unruly and arrogent children in the country aboard. (If this is the flower of American youth, we should be really scared about the future.)

<Content>Great Location. Big Rooms. Noisy. Stayed at the Castle Inn for 3 nights last week. Was at a superb BB in Napa the night before and a more upscale hotel in Nob Hill before that on the same trip. Initially disappointed with the look  feel, but soon got over it. Location is good, as you are right on Van Ness and can get anywhere from there with ease. Not much in walking distance, imo, compared with other areas. Decent restaurants, but not great ones. Rooms are huge in SFO terms. Great showers, lots of water pressure. Very noisy in the room (road  other guests). Staff are excellent. A great quality value inn.

<Content>Previous reviews by owners/managers?! Not the reality that I experienced! I was there last weekend, my fourth visit in a years time. Three previous stays were for business trips. Yes, the Castle Inn is centrally located and has off-street parking. But, the clientele being catered to has DRASTICALLY changed! The new, evidently preferred customer is the party all night and urinate off the balcony crowd. Literally. The owners/managers were certainly mum on any behavior or guest management efforts, even bragging that these same guests were back out drinking on the sidewalks at 8am the next morning. Just what a business customer or traveling couple wants to hear? Definitely not. Drug store earplugs and a fan running on high did not drown the night-long parties. Definitely not the experience I expected or paid for! If money is your only concern and you don't mind lodging with hooligans for neighbors, this is your place.

<Content>Not fit for a king, but certainly fit for a tourist! Our stay at the Castle Inn was truly pleasant - an experience that we hope soon to repeat. The location was perfect - it was within walking distance of all major sites, if you don't mind the occasional San Francisco hill. My wife and I spent four days using The Castle Inn as our base from which we walked San Francisco. Our room was simple and clean - the refrigerator was nice to keep our bottled water cold. The management was very helpful, more than once offering advice on how to get to our daily destinations. Parking was a breeze with the two lower lots. Our opinion of the Castle Inn was that it was clean, safe, convenient, and above all, priced well. For the price, I don't think that there is a better deal in San Francisco! That being said, there were a few things that bothered us - we couldn't get the elevator to work until the third day we were there (being on the second floor, it wasn't much of an inconvenience), the parking garage had this horrible ear-piercing alarm that went off everytime we walked into it, and finally, our room fan created this horrible noise whenever we had it on. Overall, however, we enjoyed our stay, and will certainly think of The Castle Inn first when we go back to San Francisco.

<Content>I'll be back I was in California on business, so I added a few personal days to visit my favorite city. The Castle Inn was in a great location, away from the chaos of Union Square and the Disneyland of Fisherman's Wharf, but close enough to catch a cable car or walk about a bit. What particularly sold me on the Castle Inn was the included on-site parking. Anywhere else, you'd end up spending $25/day (or more), and have to deal with the hastle of getting your car in and out, but the ability to hop in my car and take off to distant destinations was a great plus.The rooms were modest, comfortable and clean. The area was safe and quiet. Varsa, the concierge, was terrific. She has a great knowledge of the city, was very helpful, and was just generally charming. I believe there was a continental breakfast included, but I opted to go down the block to Polk St. for great coffee at Peet's. Forget about Starbuck's!This motel is not fancy, but it's a great deal. I hope to come back with my family soon. There's a huge suite that can accomodate a large family.(Just a hint-I think if you call the Inn directly you can get a better rate than the online deals-Ask for Varsa!)

<Content>Loved the hotel.. the location... Marshall  What a wonderful property! Marshall and Arlene were very helpful and made our stay feel more like a bed and breakfast than any other hotel we've visited. The location was perfect for walking or getting to public transportation. We used the fridge in the room to chill our wine purchases after a day in wine county! The free parking was a steal. I would love to return tomorrow.

<Content>Castle Inn excellent value Very nice hotel and a good value. We had the handicapped room so the bathroom was extremely large and the room was average size. Very comfortable king size bed. Pretty good location, some homeless were hanging around on the corners at night but I didn't feel too uncomfortable.

<Content>Excellent Choice I booked this hotel for myself and relatives visiting from Norway. The owners are first rate! They noticed the reservations coming in at the same time and correctly assumed we were together and gave us one connecting room, and the other room very close.We had our own travel guide with them. They gave us endless useful information, a discount transportation coupon and maps.The location was great! In a neighborhood so you felt at home. Just down a 1/2 block were tons of good restaurants, and a bagel shop which we visited for our breakfasts.I would highly recommend this hotel, and plan to stay there again!

<Content>Location, Location I had read the reviews and wasn't disappointed.Our room was spacious and clean and the free parking and breakfast was much appreciated. Above all, however, the location was superb - central, safe and surrounded by quality, affordable restaurants and Varsa, on reception, was so welcoming, friendly and helpful with a wealth of good advice.Overall value for money at the Castle Inn, in not the cheapest of cities, was second to none.If only all small, budget hotels could offer the same...

<Content>Loved the Castle Inn If you are headed to San Francisco, the Castle Inn is a great place to stay. Varsa at the front desk was the most helpful person I've run into while traveling anywhere! She patiently helped me with directions, recommended places to eat, etc. The cleaning staff is great there too - the room was kept extremely clean! The free parking was nice too. I'll be staying at the Castle Inn again on my next trip to San Francisco!

<Content>Perfect!!! We just spent 2 nights at the Castle Inn with our two sons. It was the perfect place for our stay in San Francisco! The rooms were very nice, the location (and price) couldn't be better, and Versa made us feel right at home. We've only been back a couple of days, but have already recommeded it to some friends who are thinking of visiting San Francisco. The next time we head here on vacation, there's no question of where we're staying!

<Content>An exceptional facility, value and hosts Before traveling through Europe using Rick Steves' travel guides and philosophy where he promotes staying near the center of urban areas, we assiduously avoided these locations as overpriced, ill kept, and unsafe. We nearly let our past beliefs dictate where we would locate when we visited San Francisco. To our delight we found the Castle Inn to be a great value, fantastic location, fastidiously maintained and providing a secure parking area for our car--all inclusive in the price of the room. Our room looked recently redecorated and contained a refrigerator, coffee maker, microwave, a king size bed with an excellent mattress, and a table and chairs that offered an inviting place to read or update our travel log.Our hosts, Marshall  Arlene, were exceptional. They made us feel like valued friends. They provided us with maps, a suggested itinerary of things to see during our stay, and a detailed sheet of the various modes of public transportation listing the stops and fares. They made reservations for us for the tours we wanted to take and even found discount coupons for us in various travel guides. When we asked for advice on places to eat, they offered a compendium of choices depending on our ethnic choices--all within walking distances of the Castle Inn. The continental breakfasts they served were fresh, tasty, pleasantly presented and replenished right up to the end of the serving hours. Because of Marshall  Arlene's attentiveness and attention to detail and the needs of their guests, we assumed that they were the owners of the property rather than employees of the facility. I would suggest to the owners that they have a rare find in these two people. They should also be on the payroll of the Chamber of Commerce; they exude a love and enthusiasm for San Francisco that is infectious to anyone entering the motel to inquire of a vacancy.Thanks for making our stay so memorable. With your help we, too, left our hearts in San Francisco!

<Content>Great rooms and a great value We visit San Francisco often and have tried several properties, but we have made the Castle Inn our only place to stay. Very clean and well maintained, quiet and a great staff. Great dining within walking distance and centrally located. The best part is that it is reasonably priced.

<Content>good location and service My husband and I were on Cell Biology Meeting in S. -F. from 12.12.03 till 12.18.03. We decided to stay at Castle Inn after reading all reviews about it. The location was really great: quiet and safe. Based on the advice of the desk clerks Marshall and Arlene we used a trolley to get to Moscone Center, every night walked to Fisherman's Wharf. The room was clean, nice, quite, had fridge with freezer, microwave and coffee maker. Parking was free. Next time we will stay at the same place.
