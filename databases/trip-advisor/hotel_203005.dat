<Content>No major complaints. We stayed as part of a group playing golf/ combined with visiting the city. Good location as regards getting to the golf courses, (just off the motorway) but at least 1 hour by coach on motorway to 3 of the courses. As regards getting to the city, from the hotel it is possible to get the bus (frequent service) to the centre (23), and return with 23A. Taxis freely available also. Nearby the hotel there are good coffee shops, and many other shops + big Coop supermarket. Swimming pool is closed for the winter season. Staff at the front desk were extremely helpful, no problems with check-in or check-out. Clean  comfortable rooms, with great shower.

<Content>Good parking, eat out. Spent just one night in the Holiday Inn whilst visiting Florence. The hotel is outside the main city area and has a good car park. We arrived at the hotel parked the car and caught the bus into Florence right outside the hotel, any 23 going in but 23A coming back.The room was ok but the reception staff were miserable.Did eat in the hotel. It was expensive for a very poor meal. I recommend you eat out.Expensive for what it is.

<Content>Potentially really nice Make sure to check your room thoroughly when you first check in. The wiring in my room was apparently scrambled, which killed the phone and internet (and minibar, which seemed to be the hotel's main concern). At any other hotel a half-functional room would get a half-price rate, but the staff of the hotel was much more concerned with their bottom line than with customer satisfaction.The rooms are otherwise nice and the free parking is an attraction, but remember that you can't (legally) drive into central Florence. So if you're there for more than a day or two, you're probably better off staying in one of the central Florence hotels and ditching the car (or paying ~20 euros for one of the secured parking locations). Otherwise you're in for an expensive cab ride or an unpredictable bus trip.

<Content>Largest hotel pool in Florence We stayed in the Holiday Inn, Florence for two nights as part of a 4 day mini-break, which is located on the Southern suburbs of the city.The hotel has hassle-free parking and is located approx. 10 minutes away from the city centre by taxi (鈧?10).As Priority club members we were given a lovely refurbished room on the top floor over-looking the swimming pool and enjoyed an extremely comfortable stay.The swimming pool is apparently the largest of any hotel in Florence and is open from early May to the end of September. It is kept beautifully clean and has a proper 10ft deep end which is clearly marked and great for adults. The helpful attendant also offers complimentary towels to use if you want a swim.The breakfast was rather expensive so we opted to eat at the nearby filling-station which has a small cafe offering pannini's and coffee for around 鈧?5 each.If you want a relaxing base to enjoy the wonderful city of Florence, and fancy a pool to yourself to relax by, then look no further than the Holiday Inn, Firenze.

<Content>Great location The hotel was just off the motorway and easy to find with free parking. The hotel staff were very friendly and told us how to get to the centre of Florence on the bus, which was very easy. The room was above average but we were disappointed with the restaurant both for the evening meal and the breakfast.

<Content>Restaurant let down Although the hotel was on the outskirts of Florence it is readily accessible from the motorway and has excellent bus services to get you into the centre in 10 minutes or so at off peak, 20 minutes plus when in rush hour. The tickets are available at reception so no need to go searching for the 'Tabac' as in Spain. The room was excellent on the executive floor, well serviced, facing the park at the rear. The restaurant however was a complete let down. After a busy day we like to remain in the hotel for our meal and that is why we chose a hotel with a restaurant. However the restaurant itself was absolutely souless. The lights were on full, not allowing even the illusion of atmosphere. There were so few people in there that we felt depressed with the whole experience. It was like a works canteen when everyone had left. Even the coach parties dined in a separate room, so no opportunity for people watching. We tried sitting in the bar but again we were on our own in an area like a wide corridor between reception and the dining rooms. The other 3 nights we made other arrangements, even taking room service which was adequate. Breakfast was the usual mix of hot and continental. The continental was ok, but the hot was a bit hit and miss in that when an item ran out the churlish staff were reluctant to replenish the trays. On our last morning they ran out of bacon at 9.0am and given that the restaurant was open until 10.30 or so it was not unreasonable to expect more customers, but not here. My wife was bluntly told, 'no more'. We saw several customers look in the hot food containers, obviously considering a cooked breakfast, but finding nothing there, wandered off. Nice hotel overall, just don't rely on eating there after all its quite expensive and can be bettered outside.

<Content>Great place to stay Just completed a 3 day stay at the Holiday Inn - South in Florence. Was very impressed. The hotel has recently completed a remodel of the interior and rooms and we found the room we stayed in was outstanding (executive level). The room is large (by Euro standards) and nicely furnished. The bathroom is done in marble and granite and the room has a minibar, safe, and internet access. The bed is King size and was firm but very comfortable. I stay in hotel rooms over 200 nights per year and this was one of the nicest mid-priced hotels I have stayed in. The hotel is located on a convienent major road into Florence and is in a pleasant neighborhood. While the hotel is not much to look at from the outside, our room faced a lovely park and was very quiet. Within easy walking is an excellent coffee house (Marcello's with cappucino for 1.10 Euro!!), ATM, several moderately priced tratteria's (dinner for two for less than 25 Euro), and large local shopping area (CO-OP). The cab fare into the center of Florence was 12 Euros. The breakfest at the hotel was overpriced (36 Euros for two), although drinks at the bar were cheap (4 Euros for a glass of wine). We found this hotel to be more than acceptable. If you don't need to be right in the center of Florence and want to avoid the high prices there (coffee at 4 Euros and a glass of water for 2 Euros), this hotel will serve you nicely.

<Content>Better than expected This hotel is well located for the motorway and access to Florence by bus is very easy from the stop directly outside the hotel. Driving in is possible (we did it once).The Hotel is a bit dated bu the rooms are clean and comfortable and although not huge, big enough for a family with small children. Breakfast was OK and we didn't experience the problems noted below. The staff could be a bit grumpy though.The pool was great for both adults and children and not too busy. It was ticked away behind the hotel surrounded by trees and hedges.

<Content>Good points and bad points Good points: bus stop outside hotel, comfortable roomBad points: Breakfast, skip it unless you want food poisoningMilk was off  bread rolls were mouldy. We complained to a member of staff who turned out to be the Food and Beverage manager. What this guy told us actually made a bad situation worse. He tried to say the greyish colour which I still believe was mould, was in fact 'OIL' , yes oil from the machines used to make the bread rolls in the bakery !! If this was the case then why on earth hadn't they changed their supplier ?? He told us there is often oil in the rolls and it can do us no harm, no thank you !!

<Content>Ok but... Clean and neat with very straight faced reception staff, although bar staff were much more friendly. We didn't use the restaurantas it was much cheaper to get breakfast outside in one of the local cafes and watch the locals call in on their way to work. Buses stop just outside the hotel so very convenient but quite a long and very uncomfortable journey into city centre - buses can be very crowded with many people standing. Hotel sells bus tickets. The outside pool looked well kept but was closed when we were there and only opens from 1st June through the summer. Rooms were fair sized with mini bar, hair dryer, bath/shower,comfortable beds and air/con. No complaints about the hotel, but would not stay there again due to the distance from town. Prefer to be within walking distance of the city centre so no worries about transport.

<Content>Good Hotel Great room, decent size with good bathroom (a bath and shower!). It was 1/2 hr out of Florence so had to catch a bus in or taxi (bit more expensive). The restaurant was good, not much else around though so limited choice after a while. The staff were helpful and the hotel was in good condition.Overall a nice stay but a bit too far out of Florence if you were there for a long time. For a couple of nights it is fine.

<Content>Great Choice We were fortunate to just show up and get rooms here as the hotel appeared full when we tried to book in advance, this I believe to be a glitch on the holiday inn website since they have 92 4 person bedrooms. Had we known this we would have booked at the hotel directly instead of the dump we chose online. Either way its a very nice, comfortable hotel with a bus line that picks up and drops off right outside. The buffet breakfast was decent and the staff were excellent on every shift. I would definitely go back to this hotel if ever in florence again.

<Content>Convenient, Comfortable, and Friendly My wife and I stayed at this Holiday Inn in early November and found it to be a most aggreeable accommodation. Since we had a car, its location near the autostrada on the southern edge of Florence made the hotel ideal as a base to explore Tuscan hilltowns and villas south and west of the city. The hotel's free parking and situation on the city's bus system also made it great for excursions into Florence's historic center. The room was quite comfortable and typical of what one expects of a Holiday Inn. The in-room coffee/tea maker and mini-fridge offered an opportunity for us to sellect luscious pastries and fruits from local bakeries and markets on the evening before and then have a leisurely breakfast (in our pjs, if we chose) while watching local news and weather reports and making our tour plans for the day. It was a nice change from having breakfast in the dinning room of larger hotels or the breakfast nook of pensiones, although we enjoyed those experiences, as well.However, the friendliness and helpfulness of the hotel staff made the hotel a real pleasure. We requested extra pillows, and they were delivered to the room most promptly. The attendants at the front desk went out of their way to provide us with information about the bus system, the bus numbers (which change after 9:00 p.m.), and the schedule, although they must have dozens of requests daily for that same info. When returning at 11:00 p.m., I told the bus driver where we wanted to get off, and he too was very helpful in pointing out our stop (i.e., the scenery sometimes seems a bit different after dark, and especially after several glasses of chianti!)The Holiday Inn Florence is not the place to stay if you're looking for the charm and ambience of an Italian inn, but it's great for comfort, convenience, and friendliness. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Very Happy with Hotel We stayed at this Hotel on August 4-6 for 2 nights! The Hotel was very good! A little bit out of the tourist area but this was also a good thing! Transport to Hotel was very very easy without any problems.Take a bus directly from outside the Railway station when arriving by train in Firenze (Florence) and it will drop you off just across the street from the Hotel! Bus number 23 i think. There is also a night bus available!We stayed in the executive room for an extra 15euro a night which was very nice!I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Not bad, good value for money This hotel was good value for money and had all the amenities needed, it was a bit far out of the centre of Florence, so would be more idealy suited if one wanted to do a few tours of the area. The room, unfortunately was a bit shabby with the wallpaper peeling off.

<Content>A Couple Things to Watch For The web site mentions central air, but they don't tell you all Italian hotels turn off the a/c on October 1, and it can still be hot in the room after 8 or 9 hours of sightseeing. We had the same problem in Rome three weeks earlier, and got it turned on by explaining my wife's allergies did not allow us to keep the window open because of construction dust blowing in from accross the street. This property would not turn it on, and open windows were out of the question as the mosquitoes were very large and very hungry. The room rate was most satisfactory, but they wanted approx. $35 for a buffet breakfast for two. We looked at it and were glad we had not taken them up on it. It was woefully inadequate: even if it had been $5 each I would have felt we overpaid. There's a great bakery on the same side of the street about two blocks west, go there, the coffee and pasteries are great. Remember, it's cheaper in Italy to stand at a counter than to sit and be waited on.Lastly, except for a/c issue, the staff was most heplful in all respects. They will direct you to the bus stop for the bus to the historic town center -- costs about a buck and is easy to use. Locals will be glad to help if you look perplexed.We'd stay there again, but only in a/c season or the dead of winter when we could be certain we wouldn't be too toasty in the room.

<Content>Watch out for the bath!! We stayed at the Holiday Inn in Florence from 09/09/2004 to 12/09/2004, we got a great deal on the Holiday Inn website. The room were very spacious and air conditioned and the view we got overlooking the swimming pool and the hills in the distance was fabulous. Our main gripe was the bathroom, I dont know if all Holiday Inns use the same make of baths for all of their rooms but this one was like an ice rink, it was far too high to get into and when you had a shower you slid all over the place, my girlfriend went for a shower one morning and all I heard was a scream as she had slipped and fell straight out of the bath landing in the bidet and get 3 very nasty looking bruises on her arm and side, another problem with this hotel is the location, if you do not have a car and wish to stay out late the location of this hotel could pose a problem as the buses (bus numbers 8, 31,32 and 33) stop at 2130 and taxis were non-existant and it is a 1 and half hour walk back to the hotel from the centre (we did it). In summary its a lovely hotel but would not really recommend it to anyone who did not have a car or if you dont like REALLY SLIPPERY baths.

<Content>Would like to go back! We stayed at Holiday Inn Florence from June 7 to June 10 2004, as part of travels around Italy. The cost was 115 euros per night, room only. We used the local bus which I'd say took more like 15 mins to get into town, but it could drop you in one of many ideal locations. Cost 1euro per journey, or 4.40 per day ticket. Taxi from city late at night, near river 10euros. Some shops around the corner and cafes which we didn't notice until we were nearly leaving!The room was quite large, modernly furnished, had a little sofa bed too, and an armchair, coffee table, so great for relaxing with a drink before going out. There was an ice machine very near our room. Unfortunately no ice bucket though??? Bit strange, I called housekeeping who told me to collect one from the barman - I sent my husband down, and he had no idea where any ice buckets were!!! Room tastefully decorated. Bath with shower over. Towels changed daily. Pool is nice and very clean. As someone said, near the road, but hidden by trees, so quite private. Didn't order any drinks from pool bar etc. We bought some in central florence before getting the bus back. Bus stops immediately outside hotel - perfect!We're wanting to go back sometime to this hotel. It was really good. I can email a room photo to anyone who wants to see.

<Content>Good base to explore the region This hotel is in a great location if you are planning to use florence as a base to explore the Tuscany region. Getting in and out of the centre of florence by car is a pain, but this hotel is right by the exit onto the A1 and you can quickly be out into the Tuscan countryside. To get to the city centre from the hotel is 1euro on the bus which takes 10 minutes from right outside the hotel - very efficient  runs up to midnight. The local area that the hotel is situated in has some good shops  coffee bars etc  is a nice smart district. The bedrooms of the hotel have been refurbished very recently  are clean and bright with excellent new individually controlled air conditioning. The public areas of the hotel are a little dated looking, and we only had one breakfast in the hotel restaurant which wasn't great so we didn't try it for dinner - but then in Italy there is plenty of choice to eat elsewhere so it didn't really matter. The hotel has a lovely big outdoor pool - very clean, although very close to the road it is seperated by tall trees  the traffic is not a problem. The reception staff were extremely helpful happy to give extra information, however the housekeeping staff seemed unobservant  very slow, and trying to find someone to serve you at the bar is an interesting experiecne! But it all adds to the character. Would happily reommend this hotel on a Room only basis.

<Content>Stay Away From this Hell Hole In our 2 week tour of Italy we thought the H Inn would be our oasis. Boy were we wrong. Hot as hell central air and a staff that couldn't care less. We were to stay 4 nights and left after one. Went to a Hotel our of Rick Steve's book and it was great. I will never stay in another Holiday Inn, in Italy or anywhere.
