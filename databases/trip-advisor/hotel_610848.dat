<Content>The best place to stay We stayed here on our honeymoon for 6 nights. 3 of them in the standard room with a view of the most beautiful piazza in Florence. The room was spacious, well decorated, new, small cooking corner (fridge, dishes, stove, sink) The last 3 nights we upgraded into the smaller penthouse with a deck overlooking the piazza and the ponte vecchio......it was well worth the extra $$. It was a spacious one bedroom, flat screen TV's (English channels and movie options) Having wine on the deck is worth every penny and more. The staff was extremely helpful and we will stay there again next time we are in Florence. We would recommend this place to all types of travellers. It was the best place we stayed at the entire month long trip.

<Content>Great Location I stayed at the property last week with my parents. Overall there are so many positive things to say. It is very clean, very modern, comfortable and large rooms. The staff is very helpful and nice! Plus the location can't be beat! It is the best location to be in... just steps from everything!Only two things I should mention .. it isn't really a hotel or inn in the normal sense .. it is more apartments. Which is fine, just please note that there isn't a typical front desk, etc. Also, we missed having the continental breakfast and it is hard to find a place for a sit down breakfast in the morning. However, we were only there for one night so if you are staying longer, it might not be an issue since they have a fridge, stove, etc in the room. Also, not all the rooms have the same amenities .. such as cable sattelite, etc. I think this would be the perfect place to stay if you are in Florence for 3 nights or so and are looking for less of a hotel type experience.

<Content>Loved it - great location - can not wait to return! Would stay again! I stayed at the Relais Piazza Signoria with my mom in November 2007. We stayed in the Penthouse Pitti. It was wonderful! I can not wait to return and stay here again! Here are the highlights:- Location is amazing - you walk outside into a beautiful piazza - close to so many different places...we walked to everything. The Uffuzi Gallery is just feet away as is the Ponte Vecchio. Restaurants and shops all right there!- the Penthouse Pitti was awesome! 2 Bedrooms, 2 Bathrooms, kitchen with washer, living room, dinning room and outside deck with table and chairs. one bath had a jaccuzi tub - very nice! very spacious for Europe!- clean and luxurious!- super nice people there accomodating all of your needs...I checked my emails from their computer each day, they booked our museum tickets for us, and answered any and all questions. They were so helpful.- very private, very quiet- great welcome basket and their soaps/shampoos are very nice too.What else is there to say....I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone! I will go back there! I only wish I were there right now!Florence is a wonderful city and the Relais Piazza Signoria is an excellent place to stay!I did not upload photos because the photos on their site are true to what you will get when you get there and their photos are much nicer than mine.You won't be disappointed if you stay here.

<Content>Great stay! We stayed at Relais Piazza Signoria for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. We chose to stay here because it was very affordable on the awful dollar but still looked nice. Since this is more like an apartment, not really a hotel, the cab driver didn't really know where it was. He took us straight to it, but we found the sign with the street number hard to find. After we finally realized we were standing right in front of it, we went to the office to get our key. The staff were all very nice and the room was very large, modern, and clean. The window looked right out onto the piazza which was fun. It was a great location. The piazza is a very popular one and once or twice we were woken by noise. But considering how busy the streets were, that wasn't bad at all. The beds were super comfortable and the bathroom a very decent size. One time when we needed a train schedule, we went to the office to ask the owner. He was incredibly nice and printed one for us right away. The only negative was that there was construction on the room next to ours and the workers were smoking and sometimes we could smell it. This location really can't be beat. We were very pleased overall with our stay here.

<Author>TRAVELWELLALWAYS
<Content>A Beautiful Address... the Relais is a lovely apartment hotel in an incredible location--right on the Piazza della Signoria and opposite to the Uffizi. I have visited Florence many times,but never have I stayed in such a central location. I must say that this close proximity really enhanced the trip! I love walking,but walking in crowds and crowds of people I do not like. I think this is why I never truly enjoyed Florence before.It seemed that we were always fighting the masses of people.Relais is close to everything and outside opposite to it is the Cafe Rivoire,where the espresso and pastries are incredible but so reasonably priced. Rivoire closes very late so we would pop in for espresso and pastries at 10PM! The apartment is furnished in a minimalist attractive way---very New York or Milan. Bedding was very white and crisp and clean smelling! Towels were changed daily by the maid and beds made as well.Roberto,the manager is there from 8 or 9 AM until 5:30PM.He is wonderfully helpful and will bend over backwards to help you with anything you need. It was great having the kitchen---not to really do cooking in but to keep salad materials,fruit,etc. for snacks.The bathroom was new and quite nice! Everything was nice and the price incredibly good for Florence. But again,the location was what made the difference!

<Content>Good value with an outstanding location My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Relais Piazza Signoria on our recent 3 night stay in Florence, Italy. We picked this hotel based on the positive reviews on TripAdvisor and the convenient location to Florence's historical sights.The hotel was every bit as good as advertised. It should be noted that these are apartment-style rooms, as part of the property is residential and the other units are the hotel. That said, the rooms are very large by any standard and feature a small kitchenette (stovetop, mini-fridge, sink, and coffee maker). The staff even provides you a couple complementary sodas, waters, biscuits, and coffee/tea packages. The only oddity is that the shower doesn't have a curtain or door, so a lot of water can spray onto the bathroom floor (a bigger problem for the cleaning lady than us, but we felt bad having to have the towels washed every day).The location cannot be topped. This place is literally right on the Piazza Signoria on the same side as the Uffizi and is located between a small bar and gelato shop. Surprisingly, despite the location close to so much action, the hotel is very quiet. One thing to note for travellers planning to stay here is that the hotel signage is very small ... a 5 X 7 gold plaque etched with the hotel's name. Make sure you get some good landmarks on the piazza to find the hotel so you don't end up walking the entire perimeter to find it.Finally, it's worth noting how helpful Rosa and her manager were during our stay. While this is an apartment-style hotel, they work very hard to provide services that one would want in a traditional hotel. Our airline lost our luggage, but Rosa helped let us use the phone to call Milan to check on our bags. She also left us notes daily to let us know if the airline called or if there was any change in our bags' status.If we go back to Florence, we'd easily stay at this hotel again and we'll definitely recommend this property to any of our family or friends.

<Content>Delightful: The Heart of Florence These apartments are finished in a modern minimalist style (in contrast to the Renaissance square outside the windows). Our room was on the second floor with a mini-balcony overlooking the Piazza Signoria, which is the centre of historic Florence. It is about 200 metres away from the Uffizi, and we were looking directly at the Palazzo Vecchio. Room was very pleasant, and it was always fun looking out on the square, which is swarming with tourists from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., but then generally quiet. Shopping is immediately adjacent, and the Duomo is a 5-10 minute easy walk. Two minutes to the Ponte Vecchio and the River Alba. Florence is very busy, but if we return, we will stay here. Tip: Take a taxi from the rail station when you arrive....it is very difficult to find (because the door is unmarked) until you know what you are looking for....the taxi drivers know.

<Content>Perfect location, perfect apartment. My husband and I have just return from our stay at the RPS, where we spent our 25th wedding anniversary. We had one of the penthouse suites which was amazing. Huge terrace with table and chairs, a sitting room with leather sofa, flatscreen tv and dining table and chairs. A little kitchen, which was well equiped, a great bathroom with a jucuzzi bath and a really nice bedroom with flatscreen tv which had many English speaking channels.The view was amazing from the terrace, we spend ages just looking over the Piazza, with a glass of Chianti in our hand. Rosa was great, booking restaurants, getting train timetables etc. We were even given a lovely gift for our anniversary which was a really sweet and appreciated touch. The hotel is in a perfect location. Everything is within easy walking distance, which is good as we did a lot of walking. There a loads of shops, restaurants and ice cream places al around.I would definately recommend this hotel and give it 10/10.

<Author>W0rldTravelerNY
<Content>LOVED it! But a couple of thoughts when you book... First I should say that the location of this hotel was perfect, I loved being in the middle of everything. The inside of the apartment was very nice (we had the two room apartment with one king sized bed and two bunk-beds in the second room), with great furnite, a tiny kitchen, nice LCD TVs (although no English speak channels) and great customer service! There was a welcome package with some juices, snacks, tea, coffee and water, which was a nice change from $10 water at the mini bar that you don't usually drink. My one complaint was that there was construction going on on our floor and so it was very loud. They started very early in the morning and we got woken up by it. However, aside from that it was a wonderful experience. I would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Great Place !!!! But.... It is a great hotel/apartment that has been recently renovated and it shows !!! I would recommend it to anyone, but...The location is good news and bad news....Good news is that it is located right on the Piazza Signoria 50 yards from the Uffizzi and Palazzo Vecchio and a couple of blocks from the Ponte Vecchio and Dumo...what a great location !!Bad news...it's located right on the Piazza...Italians (and everyone else for that matter) don't appear to go to bed at all...there were people wandering and talking and laughing all night. That would have not been too bad except that we needed to have the windows open because it was warm and the AC doesn't get turned on until June...so basically we didn't sleep too well...When the windows were closed it was great, the renovation and new windows cut the sound perfectly...but when they were open...That is the only bad thing I can say...if you want a hotel with a fancy lobby and a concierge then this isn't the place for you, but if you want to be right in the middle of it all, this is the place !!

<Content>OMG Best Hotel EVER! Great deal, Perfect Location Relais Piazza Signoria is AMAZING! It is in the best location- overlooking piazza signoria (which is one of the most popular and beautiful centers in florence, home to the uffizi and palazzo pitti, great restaurants, horse drawn carriages and fountains). You are also a 2 minute walk from the duomo, ponte vecchio, and close to everything else you'd want to see. We even walked with our bags from the train station and it wasn't bad at all. We thought it was a great deal for europe anyway (140 euros/ night in march for deluxe studio), but when we arrived they gave us a free upgrade to the executive room since they weren't full! The room is every bit as beautiful, clean, and modern as it looks in the pictures. Literally the comfiest bed I've ever slept in in a hotel, and not 2 twin beds pushed together to be considered a queen, like most european hotels. We were on the 5th floor and loved opening the windows and watching the lovely scene below. It is more like having your own apartment rather than staying at a hotel, but there is staff always available to answer your questions, or help with train tickets, museums, or anything. They were so nice! The room is decorated very cool- and HUGE for european standards! lots of room and hanging space- a plasma tv with 800 channels (of course most of them not english.. but still). The bathroom is very nice, and big. It has a rain-style shower head which was amazing. There is a small kitchen- stove and fridge, stocked with drinks, coffee, and snacks which are all free!! We just could not have enjoyed our stay more. It was by far our favorite place we stayed in our whole trip to europe, and the cheapest! You really couldn't ask for a better location, nicer accommodations, or a better deal! I can't imagine what negative things anyone could have to stay about this place. I did a lot of research and picked this based on the great reviews, and am so glad i did! It is just such a neat place, I want it to do well and more people get to enjoy it.

<Content>Comes highly recommended As others have already stated this place comes highly recommended. Room as pictured on website, spotlessly clean with thoughtful additions to ensure a comfortable stay; while staff lovely and restaurant recommendations- especially 4leoni- superb.However it is the location that is hard to beat- so central to all the key areas most tourists would wish to visit. This was nice as could easily pop back to room for comfort break/freshen up before the next gallery or museum!Because the location is so central there is obviously alittle noise from outside from 7am onwards- with lorries delivering or cleaning of square- but nothing too bad- and to be honest we were up for the 8.15am starts at the museums. A little top-tip would be to plan you itinerary before arriving as different museums are closed on different days and many open at 8.15am, closing at 1.50pm for the rest of the day.....and obviously book the Uffizi online to save queuing!

<Content>My favourite hotel in my favourite city! Just returned home from Florence having stayed four nights in this wonderful hotel. Was in one of the studio suites and couldn't fault the room from the comfy bed, Sky tv, ferragamo bath products, rain shower to the lovely little kitchen.Having stayed here in 2007, it was a no-brainer to return here. It is so accessible to all of Florence's sights. Its at most 20mins from the train station by foot and the Uffizi Gallery and Ponte Vecchio are literally 90seconds walk away. Heaven!No breakfast provided but the kitchen and all the delightful eating places beside the hotel meant that certainly wasn't a problem.Roberto, the manager, is extremely helpful and has given me good advice on trains, places to eat and also where to go to buy a football ticket for Fiorentina! In summary, a fantastic hotel in one of the world's most beautiful cities! Don't waste any time looking for anywhere else, just book here!

<Content>Nice and convenient Relais Piazza Signoria is an excellent choice in the heart of Florence. Our apartment was ultra clean, functional and had a wonderful view of the piazza which was particularly festive at night with a concert stage. Roberto answered our questions with a smile and made dinner reservations for us. Overall we felt the Relais provided tremendous value for its price and would recommend it highly!

<Content>A view and location to die for October 2007 was our second year to visit this relais. Last year we stayed 4 nights. This year we stayed 10 nights in both a single room with an angular view of the Piazza and the Penthouse Signoria (with a balcony on the Piazza). The location is perfect. The rooms were sparsely furnished but clean, new and comfortable. The owner, Roberto, is very helpful and accomodating. No breakfast is included or available, but Roberto stocks the accomodation with a couple of days of breakfast goodies, coffee, hot chocolate and cold goodies. Seconds away from the center of the Piazza and two minutes from the Ponte Vechio, and a 15 minute walk to the train station.

<Content>Perfect location, great accommodation. My girlfriend and I decided to stay at the Relais Piazza Signoria after reading the reports on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed 鈥?it was even better than I expected. The apartments are based about 10 mins walk from the main railway station, although I would advise a taxi if you have luggage. We stayed in a Studio Room Executive which over looked Piazza Signoria and was perfect for our needs. The apartment was a good size, clean, modern, well furnished with a small kitchenette. I can鈥檛 imagine there are many other nicer and more conveniently located hotels or apartments in central Florence and I would highly recommend this place to anyone whether it was for just a couple of days or even a few weeks stay.

<Content>Great find in Florence!!! We absolutely loved this hotel. From the street, you had no idea what type of place this would be, but once we got to our rooms, the place was incredible.  We had one of the penthouses, which was basically like a small apartment on the top floor. We needed a place for four, and I found it hard to find hotels that had quad rooms. We had been getting two rooms in the other hotels we stayed in while in Italy, and the cost of this room, was quite comparable, if not a little less, than getting two hotel rooms and much less space. This place had two bedrooms, two complete baths (one with shower, one with tub), a little kitchen, a living area and a dining area. It also had a small washing machine which was great for a little midweek laundry! It also had a small patio outside on the roof that had a great view. There is another smaller penthouse, that we did not see, that apparently has a view directly above the piazza.  The hotel was clean and the rooms simply funished and well appointed. Loved the Ferragamo bath products!  The hotel was in a perfect location in the city. We were within walking distance of practically anything. This hotel did not have a breakfast included (no dining at all), but it was not even missed as there were so many cafes so close by.  We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful experience The hotel is really an apartment house with a few of the units converted to rentals. For the price we paid, we were prepared to love the location and endure the room. We were THRILLED by both the room, as well as its location. The floors are all beautiful hard wood, the furniture is modern and very tasteful, the minibar is stocked and uncharicteristically free, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was HUGE, and it was so quiet, even though we overlooked the Piazza della Signoria. We were even surprised to have maid service! We would stay here again in a heartbeat.The staff could not have been more helpful. We faced one of Italy's notorious train strikes on the very day we were to depart for Rome, and they spent much time with us making phone calls and accommodating our new time constraints. We could not find a thing to complain about in this hotel. Even the tiny elevator was charming, in a kitchy sort of way. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who will be traveling to Florence. I spent literally hours on-line looking for hotels. Save your time. Just book your stay here.
