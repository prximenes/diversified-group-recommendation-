<Content>If you do the math .. Not a bad hotel at all.We got the Amsterdam at 6am in the morning so I asked for an early check in. The man at the front desk told me that they can check me in early for 20 euro.I agreed to have it added to my bill so we could get to our room and sleep a couple hours.Well,he sent us to a room that was not cleaned from the previous guest yet,so I brought all the bags back down to the desk and they did provide a room that was clean finally.A least I was not charged at the end.They were good about that.I ordered a room with 1 bed( Queen ? )for 2 people( my wife and I ) and I was kind of disappointed to find that it was two twin mattresses pushed together , so there was this annoying gap down middle of the bed which made it impossible for us to sleep close.So,yes the bed sucked.The location of the hotel is a bit far from Central but I didn't mind the walk to the tram stop . Its is about a 10 min walk to the Tram and about a 20-25 min tram ride to Central Station . My main complaint with the hotel came on the morning we checked out . The night before , I had paid for the hotels Airport Shuttle  to take my wife and I to the Airport the next morning at 10:15 . The next morning I checked out at 10 am and the guy who checked us out says to me The airport shuttle is waiting for you right outside . So I check out and walk out front . No shuttle in sight. I walk back to the desk and ask where the shuttle is? He looks outside and says Oh no , It looks like they left.He said another shuttle would be along soon .No shuttle after an hour wait. I had to take a cab and almost missed my flight! I did the math and the few hundred I spent on Transportation ( 2 cab rides and 7 day Tram pass = about $340 ) , I could have paid a little more for a room in Central A-dam and not had to take a cab or tram at all . Next time I will .

<Content>Further out than expected! The hotel itself was fine, pretty standard 3* deal. However, when booking through Expedia, was told it was 15 mins away from the centre by public transport. It actually turned out to be a 10 min walk to the tram stop, plus a 20 min tram journey, so that was pretty misleading. Another thing they don't mention on Expedia is that the hotel is located in a pretty dodgy looking residential area. This made the walk from the tram stop back to the hotel a little unsettling at night, so much so, that after the first night, we paid for a taxi back if we were coming back late. This cost us 20 euros, but was worth paying the money just to feel safer. Staff in hotel were good. Room cleaned every day, TV had quite a few channels on it. If you don't mind staying so far out, then it's fine, but I think next time we will try something more centrally located, perhaps the Tulip Inn in Dam Square!

<Content>Good hotel with reasonable location Hi I am from Hong Kong~I have been to Amsterdam for 4 days in July 2008.I find the Tulip inn city west is quite good. Some people complain the location is too far. However, I think the transport is good enough, I go to the city centre by Tram 17, (just 5-7 mins walk to the tram stop) and the journey is about 30 mins to the city centre.the hotel is quite near the airport actuallyOn day 1, I take the train from Airport to Amsterdam Lelyln station (about 5 mins, 2.8 Euro) and then change the bus no. 63 at Lelyln station to the hotel (about 10 -15 mins) And the bus station is quite near to the hotel. (within 1 min walk)If you take the train to Amsterdam Lelyln and change bus no. 63 to the hotel, it is cheaper and faster than you go to Central station and take tram 17.Whenever we wanna go to city centre, we can take tram 17. On day 3, we go to Rotterdam and Den Haag, we take bus no. 63 to the Amsterdam Lelyln station, and take the train to Den Haag.Again, it is faster and cheaper if you take the train from Amsterdam Lelyln station to Den Haag (35 - 40 mins) than you take the train from Central station.If you do not only stay in Amsterdam centre, but also visit other famous cities like Den Haag or Rotterdam.I think Tulip inn city west is quite convenient actually.Moreover, the surrounding of the hotel is quite beautiful, clean and peaceful. It is really different from the city centre of Amsterdam. And there is a famous building located next to the hotel is really wonderful.

<Content>a gud hotel with gud price As every one is complaining the distanc from the city center , i dont agree . If can spare 20 minutes , it is good enough travelling time from cetral to the hotel. Rooms are very good in size and toilets too.coffee and tea is complimentry ,this is in mid of residential area ,so one can get he real feel of amsterdam life (some thing beyond RLD). There no problem of food as there are lots of option within a short walk as well as in hotel also.go for it

<Content>Nice hotel but far from city Booked from booking.com. The hotel is decent, friendly staff but as others mentioned, it is rather far from the city center. Approx 25 min tram ride, on top of a 5-7 minute walk to the tram stop. On the positive side, the tram runs fairly frequently and the hotel is not too far from the airport. A taxi ride from the city center to the hotel is approximately EUR 10-12

<Content>Great hotel! This hotel is exceptionally cheap, which initially makes you kinda worry! It's cheapness is due to its location which you'll have read on other reviews. The travel system in Amsterdam is so good that you'll be able to jump on a tram at any time. THere's no real waiting time. Get a no 17 to Osdorp and get off at the stop called Hoekenes. You then just have a 5 min walk to the hotel. The area, if arriving at night, may look a little seedy, but it really isn't. YOu'll see during the day that its a very family orientated area and everyone from folk on the street to people in the shops are very kind and friendly. Once you've done it once, you'll be just fine. What we did on the first night, having arrived late, was to get a taxi, from the centre of Amsterdam. This was 24 Euros, which was quite expensive, but when you just do it once, you're laughing for the rest of your time.It is a good quality hotel, nice and warm with really cosy beds and tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom is unusually large for Amsterdam and is kept very clean.Enjoy Amsterdam!

<Content>Good Hotel - Bad Location We stayed at the Tulip Inn City West from 1st Feb 2008 to 3rd Feb 2008. We visited Amsterdam with 4 friends who had booked a hotel closer to the city. The hotel itself was fine, clean, very friendly and helpful staff, spacious rooms and good TV channels. The only down side is the location. Im not adverse to having to travel a bit to get to the centre, particularly given that we got a good price from hotels.com however, it would have been much better booking a hotel nearer the city.When we arrived it cost 25 euros by taxi from Central Station to the hotel. Be weary of the taxis, they tend to try and shaft you as they will either give you the option of a fixed price and no meter, or use the meter but take you on a detour around the city! One time the taxi cost us 30 euro and we were already half way to the hotel, after an argument with the taxi driver, he cut it to 15! The trams are a good way of getting round but its still pretty awkward. The tram stop is probably a 15 minute walk from the hotel, which isnt too far but it is when its very cold and windy. Particularly at night time when you have to change trams etc to get home. Its probably one of those things when you know where to go it would be easier but as we were only there a few days we didnt rally have time to understand it!The hotel is set in what can only be described as a housing estate with nothing other than a few shops nearby - only a spar! So be prepared that once your back at the hotel, your pretty much there as theres nothing much else to do there! Its difficult to fault the hotel itself its just the location. I gelt that it sort of spoilt our weekend slightly as we were constantly aware that it would take about an hour to get back to the hotel at night unless we wanted to pay a fortune for taxis.Its a lovely hotel but I couldnt recommend it to weekend tourists.

<Content>Not too bad Not a bad hotel if you're on a budget. It does take about 25 minutes to get downtown on the tram, plus another 5-10 minutes to walk to the tram stop. There are only a few restaurants around the hotel, so plan on eating downtown before heading back for the night. Area around the hotel is fairly dark at night, few streetlights on a couple of the streets you must walk to get back to the hotel from the tram stop. Felt pretty safe though, didn't have any problems with anyone in the area. You will walk past a local italian restaurant on the way to the tram stop, it's pretty good, cash only. Rooms were pretty average, nice size rooms for europe, but pretty plain. Hotel restaurant was ok, but very pricey. All in all, not a bad place if you're trying to save money from the more expensive hotels downtown.

<Content>Confortable but too far from the city centre We stayed here overnight and it was very comfortable. Spacious and clean rooms and pleasant staff. The view wasn't too die for unless you're a huge fan of concrete blocks. It is about 25 minutes from the central station by tram and we lost our way the first time. If you're looking for a warm comfortable, not-too-expensive hotel to stay in, this is a great place. But if you want to experience the buzz of living near the city centre, I'd suggest you stay somewhere else.PS: If you do get the I Amsterdam card, don't bother buying cheese from the Cheese Gift Shop at the Magna Centre, its an absolute rip off. They give you a 'discount' on a four-pack of cheese, claiming its 35 Euros (they sell it to you for about 26). There's an excellent cheese shop at Schipol airport that sells the same pack of cheese (fresher though) for cheaper.

<Content>A very friendly, clean and comfortable hotel We stayed at the Tulip Inn City West from August 26-29th 2007 for a short citybreak in Amsterdam. The best way to get to the hotel from Schiphol airport is via the shuttle taxi service bookable in the airport lobby (19 Euros each return) which is a ten/fifteen minute ride.The staff at the hotel were all excellent, being friendly, helpful and polite at all times, especially regarding transport. The room was great for a three-star, with air conditioning, tea and coffee facilities, a safe, multi-lingual television channels and plenty of space. It was spotless upon arrival and the towels and linen were changed during the stay. Whilst we could hear other people in the corridors occasionally, the hotel was generally very quiet and peaceful.As others have mentioned, the Tulip Inn City West is a little out of the centre of Amsterdam, but the surrounding area is pretty quiet and we certainly never fealt uneasy walking around after dark. Getting into Amsterdam is really easy, with a five-minute walk to the nearest tram stop then a 30 minute ride to Centraal station. The 13.50 Euro 3 day pass available from reception is well worth the money.We chose to eat whilst out and about so cannot comment on the standard of food offered at the hotel. The only improvement we could suggest would be the provision of a bath, as our room only had a shower but this is a very small gripe. All in all, we thouroughly enjoyed our stay and will definately be returning.

<Content>Average hotel I chose the Tulip Inn West as we were needing a night in Amsterdam before returning to ferry at Ijmuiden and this hotel was on the correct side of Amsterdam. The staff were very helpful and as our room was not ready when we arrived we registered and they stored our luggage whilst we went into Amsterdam for the day. The tram journey in and out was fine but I am not sure I would have been so keen to do it at night as the walk back to the hotel was through a rather rough area. Our room was spacious and clean and the bed was very large and comfortable. We ate at the hotel in the evening and the meal was fine and service good. For our needs the Tulip served an adequate purpose.

<Content>good hotel bad info on shuttle We stayed on the 15th of May here because we had a 5 hour layover from Nice to Amsterdam to LAX. I called ahead of time and was informed that there would be a shuttle avalable to pick us up and take us back in the morning. Well we arrive 10:30 pm and it turns out service finished at 9:30, so we ended up taking a taxi that cost us 50.00 euro - aka $65.00 US!!!! So we arrive and I had PAID in advanmce thru Orbitz and the guy at the hotel tells me we need to pay, I show him my Orbitz receipt and thank goodness I paid with AMEX, because I will fight it if we get double charged. Anyways, so since the taxi took all euros, I asked if the hotel had a ATM, and he said no. We would have to walk about 15 minutes to a mall for cash. I ask for the shuttle info, he points over to a stand and the first shuttle does not go out until 7:30 am and we had to be at the airport at 6am???!!!. So boys and girls, the moral of the story iis that its a clean hotel but they should be more clear about the shuttle service and not be considered an airport hotel. If I would to do this all over I would stay with what I am familiar, a best western, mercure, sheraton hotel that does have a shuttle service all night and day long because it caters to airport/layover clients.

<Content>Adequate hotel The hotel is best described as ok. Location wise, it's really not very good at all. You're only about a 10 minute walk to the nearest tram (Hoekenes) and these arrive pretty regularly - takes about 25 mins to get into town. However, the area around there is not good and walking to the hotel after the dark was pretty nerve-wracking!! No incidents, but not pleasant walking through blocks of high-rise flats.We actually arrived quite late and our room had gone, but luckily for us we were given a suite. Great! Hold back with your expectations - the suite is on the top floor and simply is a larger room containing an additional double bed (looked like a couple of z-beds placed together). It was clean and tidy and had all the usual things you'd expect. In terms of a room, I couldn't complain and the bed was very comfy.We booked the airport shuttle to get back, however, when I checked, the woman had failed to tell the shuttle bus we needed to be picked up! I complained and we were given a taxi (which the hotel paid for) - still, very unimpressive service.I didn't have the breakfast so can't comment.Overall, not a bad hotel - does the basics well, but use it as a bed for the night and nothing else. Don't pay a lot for it - we searched the internet and got it for about æ‹¢35 a night - probably a good price for what we got, but not worth a great deal more. Does though provide a nice contrast to the over-priced city centre hotels.

<Content>Very good hotel, excellent value Have just stayed here for the weekend and was pleasantly surprised; it was so cheap to book that we were apprehensive about what it would be like. However, the room was lovely, clean and a good size. Cable tv/ tea coffee and lovely bathroom. It is out of the way, but we came by car and it is very handy for motorists, with free parking. Only a 5- 10 min walk to the tram which takes about 20 minutes to the city. The staff were friendly and you can buy the tram tickets from the hotel, so there is no hassle involved in getting into the city. Don;t know why people would be disappointed with this hotel, for the price we paid it was excellent.

<Content>Average Airport Hotel The Tulip Inn City West is located in a more remote location in between many apartment complexes. Shuttle service is available through the common shuttle service at the airport for $10 euros one way. Previous reviews are correct that this building was not designed as a hotel and work needs to be done to upgrade the common areas. The rooms are a pleasant surprise as they are a nice size, good amenities including coffee/tea in the room, nice size bathroom with shower (and a shower curtain), and good quality towels. The walk to the tram takes about 10 minutes and the ride into downtown Amsterdam does take up to 30 minutes. I did not find this a problem as you are a ways outside of the city and the trams ran frequently. Not much near the hotel to see or places to dine so heading into the city is a great idea. Overall an average hotel but for the price we received for an airport hotel it was fine.

<Content>Not Happy My partner and myself stayed for new years eve (30th dec - 1st jan).when we arrived we had to pay 100 euro's as a deposit. We were not informed about this previous to uor stay. When we checked out, we did not get full amount back because we had to pay city tax!!!!!!!! there was no transport on new years eve after 8pm. when we found that out we thought we would at least be able to have a few drinks in hotel bar, but we cudnt as it closed at 8pm. we were fuming. we were stuck in our room all night. we did not know the hotel was so far away from the main centre of Amsterdam.if we went to amsterdam we definately wouldnt stay there again because of the distance away from everything. the ONLY upside was the cleanliness of the room. although when it was raining the rain leaked through bottom of windows onto window sill. We also ordered a pizza through room service. it cost 10 euro's plus a 3 euro surcharge. When it came it was a microwavable one. it was a plate of soggy, doughy, tomatoey mush. yuk!!

<Content>Excellent hotel for price. This is a modern hotel in a residential area, a tram's ride from the city. Staff very friendly and helpful. Double room was spacious, clean and tidy. Towels changed daily, sheets every other day. We travelled as a couple, but this hotel is well suited for families. Restaurant for evening meal (used on first night) was reasonably priced with a small but varied choice. Breakfast as expected from a 3* hotel, but was optional. Would definately usethis hotel for a repeat visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>clean and tidy hotel Just returned from a weekend stay at the Tulip Inn City West. It is a bit far out from the centre, about a 30 min tram ride, but this gave us the opportunity to see the sights of Amsterdam that we would have otherwise missed, also the tram ride is reasonable at a couple of euros and transport is very frequent. The hotel is very clean and tidy and the reception staff are helpful. We even received a complimentary upgrade on arrival to a superior room as we were celebrating our anniversary. As we stayed during an unusually hot period, the air conditioned room was appreciated. This is a pleasant reasonable hotel in a quiet location and the only negative comment I could make is that it is a bit of a distance from the town centre.

<Content>Out of the way So far from the center of Amsterdam you might as well have stayed in Kiev. They don't tell you that when you register. It was a 30 minute tram ride--right past cool restaurants, beautiful canals, pretty architecture..............not one of which I could visit because the tram just kept on going until I got to this hotel. If you like institutional to describe your hotel then you will be pleased as punch at the Golden Tulip in West Amsterdam. On the way to scope out my room (past cinder block walls, YES, CINDER BLOCK WALLS, you read right--now sit back down) I conversed with the reception agent. She related that this place used to be a nursing home, which explains a lot. The actual interior of the rooms is ok and fairly clean (no safe which is weird for a 4-star). The food at the restaurant (a mint green-colored metal box that was probably constructed in the '70s--they do not tear anything down here) was mixed. Great Thai soup and apple strudel but the rest was just ok. The service is, well, European, and profoundly slow. If you tire of the smoke drifting in from the the gerrymandered smoking section that envelopes you you can just wheel yourself out to the patio and watch the birds until naptime. Oh, sorry--still can't shake that mental image...

<Content>Solid middleclass accomodation for good rates We stayed at this hotel on a public holiday weekend because we didnéˆ¥æª› want to pay the exaggerated prices in the city center. We found a bargain price on the internet. My total vote would be: nothing fancy, but a solid middleclass accomodation and I guess well above average compared to city center hotels in the same price range.Location: A bit out of the way in a satellite city residential area (Osdorp). Easy to reach by car, plus they have an airport shuttle too. Free parking in front of the hotel (a big plus in Amsterdam too). It is an easy 10 min walk to the nearest tram station (Hoekenes), tram 17 takes you in 30 mins into the city (Dam, Main Station), the last tram runs past midnight. A 15-section strippenkaart can be bought for 6.70 Euro at the reception. Youéˆ¥æª’l need to validate 3 sections for a ride into the city, so it is good for 5 trips.Staff at the reception is friendly and helpful. Rooms are ready at 2 pm. We arrived at 1 pm, so they stored our luggage. Rooms are spacey and clean, typical middleclass hotel interieur, although no minibar. TV has international programs (CNN, BBC, German) as well.Breakfast is with 14 Euros per person quite overpriced, and selection is a bit limited and disappointing for that price. On the other hand, if you eat late and plenty, you can survive the day trip w/o lunch easily.Canéˆ¥æª› say anything positive about the bar. They offered Frozen Pina Coladas which had no alcohol taste to it and the barkeeper shrugged: éˆ¥æ¿±t comes out of this machine, we just add the water....éˆ¥? A second try with ordering a Caipirinha was even worse: how can you do that without the lime wedges?

<Content>Very bad hotel Bad bad bad, after a second honeymoon we decided to come back to Amsterdam, unfortanetly was a Bank holiday and all the hotels were booked.The trip to the hotel Tullip Inn City West took 1 hour by tram - don't believe in hotel site that says 30 min. The tram station is about 10 min walking and the is no sight to the hotel. The neighborhoud is terrible!They gave us a dissable room, w/ a large rowl in the cortin. We ask to reception to fix it and they didn't do it.We paid EUR 145 for a bad hotel w/no refrigerator in room and no room service.Bad hotel !!!!! Never spend your money here. If I could I'll make a formal complain about this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel Travelled to Amsterdam for a lads drunken weekend. Got put up in this hotel. A little out the way but a brilliant hotel nontheless. Very clean rooms. Staff are friendly and make you feel very welcome. We just had bed and breakfast,but the buffet style breakfast had plenty of choice. If you want to go into town, turn left as you leave the hotel and go past a church type thing. turn left again along the side of the church and on your right you will see a path running along side a canal. go along this path to the end, turn left and walk a couple of yards and look across the road,where you will find tram stops in the middle of the road. Wait for the number 17 tram, which will take you to Amsterdam central station. On return you want to get off at the HOEKENES stop. Retrace your steps to get back to this very pleasant and quiet hotel.

<Content>Great stay at Tulipn Inn Amsterdam West I had a great stay at the Tulip Inn Amsterdam City West. The room was large, comparable to American hotels. Comfortable bed and clean room. The staff was polite and efficient. A simple 30 minute tram ride from the city center and a five minute walk from Hoekenes stop on the #17 tram. The location is in a quiet residential area, which is great after a long day walking through Amsterdam. I recommend this hotel and will stay here upon my return to Amsterdam.

<Content>Nice and Clean Rooms at Tulip Inn City West Great hotel, The staff was very friendly and helpful/informative. They also have passes for Tramlines/buslines that are 13 Euros for a 72 Hour pass and small maps of surrounding area. They also offered a Airport shuttle service for 11 Euros (which is alot cheaper than 30-40 dollar cab fare from the airport)Now the room itself was modest, comparable to say a Motel 6, or Best Western Inn back here in the States. The carpet did have a large stain on it but I could have cared less. The beds were nice and warm, Bathroom was a nice size. and the maid service was efficent promintly there to clean your room by 10:30 am (lol a little to early if you party as much as i did lol) The tram station is about a 5-10min walk along a canal almost infront of the hotel. Unless you walk around and down pass the shops that takes about 15mins depending on how fast you walk. TIP.. BEWARE OF THE BIKE LANE AT NIGHT as I had a hard time distinguishing one from the other. and was almost run over numerous times by Bikers. lolNow the Location of this hotel is some what far from Centraal Station. about 20-40 mins depending on stops and tram capacity. If coming from Centraal Station just hope on the #17 goin to Osdorp or something like that. and get off at the Hoeknes(sp?) stop. It is one of the last stops.And for those of you that wonder, amsterdam style smoking or Pot smoking is tolerated just so long as you dont fishbowl or cloud up the hallways. and you keep the smoking In your room or outside the hotel lobby.I would definately come back to this hotel if staying in AMS again.
