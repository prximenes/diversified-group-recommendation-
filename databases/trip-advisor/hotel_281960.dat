<Content>Excellent Value and position! I must admit, I did use Trip Advisor to choose the Altamont. It was the best value hotel in the top 15 that I looked at. In fact it was quite a bit cheaper than all the others. So naturally I was a bit concerned. On arrival, I was pleasantly surprised, personally shown to my room by the Manager and it was super quiet with sliding doors looking out to a little inner courtyard.The decor was basic but also it had a trendy style. I never have a bath so the big shower was nice. Comfy bed, table and chairs, drawers with tv on it. It had space for the suitcase so what more could I possibly want? Oh yes I did want a good location, and I got it at the Altamont! Handy for restaurants, just around the corner you can get a bus to Circular Quay or at the bottom of Darlinghurst Road/Oxford St you can get a direct bus (no 333 the bondi Bendy!) to Bondi Beach!For other transport, Kings Cross is 5 mins walk away.It was clean, friendly and because Sydney is my favourite city in the world, I will be back, and to the Altamont!

<Content>Hotel Altamont felt like home From the moment we walked into Hotel Altamont, my husband and I felt like we were staying at a friends house. It is a fun and trendy place without trying too hard. The hotel is in a great location with a convenient bus to Circular Quay/Opera House close by (although we walked it a couple times too.) There are some great restaurants close by as well. Blake and Alan and his two adorable dogs made our trip however. They gave us great advice on what to do, where to eat, and in general were fun and interesting to talk to. For the price of the rooms, we were VERY pleased and would stay there again have we the chance to return to the wonderful city of Sydney. At Hotel Altamont you are definitely not a number and we really enjoyed our stay!

<Content>The "Altamont" Experience A stay at the Altamont will not disappoint if you are seeking a quiet comfortable retreat in the heart of Sydney.This hotel has a very relaxed, casual feel and is very centrally located close to the CBD and and all the restaurants, shops and nighlife that anyone could wish for.The rooms are spacious and comfortable, were always spotlessly clean and very well maintained.We were made most welcome from the moment of our arrival and we found the staff and management were always available and ready to help, but at the same time remained unobtrusive. They all had good local knowledge and were always more than happy to pass this on in a very friendly, helpful manner.We have stayed in a wide range of accomodaton venues and the Altamont has that something SPECIAL that with will bring us back to stay whenever we are in Sydney.

<Content>Great little hotel Stayed at the Altamont for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. First trip to Sydney and although its not mega-central its within walking distance of pretty much everything. Sydney is expensive for hotels but (more so if you're sharing your room with a partner/friend) the Altamont is very good value. Very friendly and helpful manager gave me some excellent advice on where to get a coffee and have dinner (Bar Coluzzi and Onde) and gave the place an overall relaxed atmosphere - very different to the chain hotels in the city. One tip is to see if you can book a room on the side of the property where the rooms have larger windows onto a small outside space. They just have a bit more light, but every room is different which is what makes this place unique. If Altamont is full, I'd recommend the Diamant. Same group of hotels, a bit more pricey, and a bit more shiny and modern but great if you're after that kind of thing too.

<Content>Unless you insist on Room Service ... Unless you insist on Room Service and 24 hours reception ... then, maybe, this hotel is not for you!But, if you like a place where you get a lovely large room with a King Size bed, light breakfast, and free use of a super new gym close by, 10 minutes walk to the city, then Altamont is for you!Been coming to this hotel regularly for the last ... oh I don't know ... 5 years, with no intention of going anywhere else!Did I mention a very friendly and personal service?

<Content>A little gem! We've just returned from a three day stay at the Altamont Hotel in Darlinghurst and enjoyed every moment! This relaxed, bright and airy and hotel was perfect for us in so many ways. Among it's charms, the Altamont is centrally located, which meant that we could walk everywhere. It's also easy on the budget. Before booking, we researched comparable boutique hotels on the net. Now that we've experienced the Altamont, we know it's great value for money. Oh and I shouldn't forget to mention that it has a 12pm check out time, how good is that?

<Content>One of the best This isn't your usual hotel with fancy reception or facilities. In fact, I think there wasn't much facilities at all, which is perfect as we never seem to be using them anyway. The rooms feel more like home than a hotel, with great comfortable double bed that's actually a double bed, and homey furnishings. Our room had no bathtubs, but a great roomy shower that we never wanted to get out of...The area is not central central, but great access to numerous cafe's and fantastic restaurants. I would definitely recommend this for anybody when they go to Sydney, and we'll be using this hotel again for sure.

<Content>Very disappointing - nothing like as expected I have just returned from an 8 day stay at this hotel and now wish that I had taken more notice of the less flattering reviews. It was definitely unlike most of the reviews that I read and detracted from an otherwise excellent stay in the wonderful city of Sydney. It may claim to be a boutique hotel but my own experience suggested otherwise. The hotel was dated, the room unsatisfactory; dark and the furniture both old (but not charming) and basic. The lighting was poor, the table-side lamps being the only source of lighting in the room. The room was also very cold. The bathroom was similarly dark and poorly lit.Both the floor and walls were made of cement, unpainted and grubby, with just the minimal amount of (old) carpet covering. There was also dust behind the bed.Furniture wise, there was neither a wardrobe nor a chest of drawers to keep your clothing. Instead, there was an old metal frame to hang your clothes and hardly any hangers. Due to the lack of furniture, there was nowhere to hide your cases either, so these had to be put on the floor and subsequently take up valuable space in a cramped room.There was also a lack of electrical sockets and mystifyingly, the mirror in the bedroom was not near one! The acclaimed courtyard was no such thing. It was just a high wall, three feet of space and a pot plant! The high wall also blocked the natural light!Regarding the amenities, on one evening, the hotel reception area was booked for a private function, so incredibly we were unable to use the facilities at all. On a final note, other reviews suggest that the manager is ultra-friendly and helpful and nothing is too much for guests. Although absent for my entire holiday bar the final morning, upon checking out, he did not enquire whether my stay had been acceptable or enjoyable. He appeared uninterested.The young man working there during our stay was however as helpful as possible and the one plus of my stay.This hotel was disappointing and in my opinion is in need of a complete makeover and was not worth the money. It is definitely not as expected or advertised and I would not stay there again nor recommend it to others, unless you are back-packing and don鈥檛 care about your surroundings! Simply awful!

<Content>Lovely stay in the Fantastic Altamont I just returned from a 2 night stay at the Altamont Hotel and have been gushing about it to all of my friends. I have stayed in all types of accommodations in Sydney, and this hotel is by far the best value for the money - and it happens to be an incredibly cool, well-appointed, and immaculately clean and interesting place to stay. We loved all of the details, from the decor to the cute little veranda in the back of our room, to the extremely knowledgeable and helpful staff. In the end, my only regret about this hotel is that I had just two short nights there. I would love to return and spend more time exploring the neighborhood and just relaxing at this beautiful hotel.

<Content>Good Value Hotel in Convenient Location Good and cheap. That makes great value. The rooms are comfortable and nicely furnished. The whole place has a boutique feel, and has great, personal service that one can expect from these small hotels.The location is convenient, with a rail station and bus stop nearby. Although in the King's Cross area, it is off the main night life strip.Only letdown was the simple breakfast, though the hotel never touts itself as a BB. Anyway, there are more than enough eating places nearby.

<Content>Altamont - Wonderful stay We had a wonderful stay at this unique beautique hotel. We stayed in the family room which although simply furnished was very comfortable and accomodated the six of us with ease. Alan was extremely helpful and a wealth of knowledge about Sydney and the local restaurants. (Eat Thai a couple blocks over was wonderful) For the exercise concious, the hotel is within 15-25 minutes walking distance of many major sights. For those inclined to take the city transportation the access to a bus stop is just around corner and the CityRail underground station is just a block or so away. The agents at the CityRail station were also wonderful help and very friendly. This is a great place to stay for the cost conscious traveler.

<Content>Outstanding Budget Boutique Accomodation This is an absolute little gem of a place in Darlinghurst Sydney. I was impressed when I made the reservation and even more so when I arrived - Really friendly and helpful staff and management. A budget hotel it may be but it far surpassess many other rated properties I have stayed in around the world !The hotel is well situated with loads of great coffee shops and restaurants a few minutes away.The rooms are a good size, spotless and totally comfortable. The decor is contemporary and stylish and I spent a very happy 6 days there. HIGHLY recommend this one - would stay there again and again

<Content>Good location and rates The Altamont is a nice boutique hotel in central Sydney, consisting of 14 well decorated bedrooms, a reception area with a bar, and a terrace with views of Sydney skyline that guests can use until 23.00. Some guides describe it as what backpackers hostels should be like but do not let this simplistic definition fool you. Although there are many hostels nearby, the Altamont is a much nicer choice if you can afford a bit more money and want quieter surroundings.The rooms are nice, contemporary and comfortable but could do with some small additions that would make them even nicer. The bathroom in our room was nicely done, but the water from the shower went everywhere, condensation was hard to get rid of after a shower making it and the room very damp, and the mirror above the sink could do with some light. I needed to shave but did not have enough light to do it. However, the furniture in the bedrooms and hallways is striking and the location of the hotel is excellent, in a busy area but not noisy in the bedrooms which are mostly located at the back of the building, some with a shared courtyard of pebbles and potted plants.The Altamont is located on Darlinghurst Road, close to Kings Cross but also to the restaurants and bars in Darlinghurst, Oxford Street and Surry Hills. This is handy as the breakfast is very basic, and there are lots of nice places for breakfast nearby such as 鈥楤ar Coluzzi鈥?or 鈥榖ills鈥? The breakfast is actually disappointing. This could be a much better venue if the breakfast was improved and I would not mind paying more for a better meal to start the day. It would be a nice touch to the mellow vocal jazz songs played in the morning.The Altamont is also convenient for good restaurants within walking distance, and Kings Cross train station is a 5-minute walk away, connecting you to the suburbs or central areas of the city. You can also easily walk to the magnificent harbour and the botanic gardens, the Opera House or the CBD. It is definitely a place I would recommend for a more personal stay in Sydney and to avoid the higher prices of luxury chain hotels. If you have pets, they are also welcome at the hotel.As a gay man, I also did not have any problems whatsoever in staying with my same-sex partner and being given a double bed, something that still sometimes raises a few eyebrows in some hotels or guest houses. Staff were very efficient and friendly and made us feel welcome all the time. Darlinghurst is a somewhat gay area of Sydney and locals and hotel guests are fine with it. The hotel even gives away complimentary copies Time Out Sydney and free gay magazines with listings of what is on in the city.

<Content>Cosy stay at the Altamont The Altamont is exactly what it claims to be, a small boutique hotel for the price of Sydney鈥檚 local hostels. It is neat and clean with staff that are both friendly and helpful. The words cosy, warm and rustic comes to mind when thinking back on our stay. When returning from our excursions, we were greeted by Alan and his two friendly dogs and at the risk of sounding cheesy, it felt like a home away from home. It鈥檚 centrally located, so you are close to all you need. We would stay there again on our next return to Sydney.Do your research before the time and you will figure out if the Altamont is right for you.

<Content>Nice hotel, friendly staff and good neighbourhood This hotel is a good hotel to start your daily Sidney explorations from. It is situated approx. 5 minutes walk from Kings Cross station. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is spacious too. Reception is open from 8am to 8-9 pm. Outside these hours, you can only enter the hotel when having a room key. Take this into account when planning your travel or phone ahead to make sure someone is available to help you.Also, be aware during weekends, as the neighborhood is very lively during the night. On one hand, this makes it rather safe to come home late if you'd like. On the other hand, the noise coming from the street might be too much for you to have a comfy sleep. Staff is great and helpful, they give you recommendations for sightseeing, eating, help you book a taxi etc. Don't expect too much of the breakfast (which is only available after 8am), but it suffices to get you through the morning. All in all, a nice hotel, good location, reasonably priced. In weekends, a bit too much noise coming from the streets.

<Content>Outstanding little hotel We were booked somewhere else in the cross, which was awful. After the first night we walked into the Altamont to see if they could fit us in for the next two nights of our stay. The front desk receptionist was extraordinarily helpful, and managed to fit us provided we were happy to change rooms. As a result we got to experience two very different rooms, both of which were great.The staff make this place stand out. They were polite, friendly, helpful and professional, but most importantly, they were genuine. The staff didnt trying to scam you, as our other hotel did, gave good advice of where to eat and how to get from A to B, and made a point of having a personal connection with you. The rooms themselves were both clean and tidy, a little quirky (which appeals to me), generously big, and again felt genuine. the fixtures and fittings are made to last, not melt away when the first guest stays after the photo shoot. I felt instantly comfortable there, and don't hesitate to recommend it.I will definitely stay again next time I'm in Sydney.

<Content>Altamont Hotel...a pleasure to stay at. Our family, Mum, Dad and two teenage boys have just returnedhome from a 5 night holiday in Sydney. The Altamont Hotel was like a home away from home...a pleasure to stay at. My husband and I independently researched our accommodation options and we both coincidentally selected the Altamont! After a phone call to Alan who could not have been more friendly or helpful our booking was complete. During our entire stay Alan, his staff and (two well behaved, quiet and friendly dogs) greeted us with smiles, friendly conversation and assisted us with our questions on travel advice. The Altamont Hotel has immense character and is so close to everything you would want to do in Sydney. The family room we stayed in was clean, huge, warm, spacious bathroom (with a bath as well as shower), comfortable beds, even a chaise longue, plenty of wardrobe/draw space and the room backed onto a sizeable outdoor terraced garden area complete with city lights. A breakfast was set up until 11:00 in the front lobby room...a room complete with couches, pool table and reading material...great for a Mum and Dad with two teenage boys. All in all this hotel was a real 'find', realistically priced and a joy to stay at. If you are looking for a warm, friendly hotel with a unique character stay at the Altamont. Alan finished the initial booking phone call with the words we'll look after you...he was genuine and completely true to his word.

<Content>Fantastic value, Fantastic location, Fantastic hotel Altamont is truly the best value hotel I have stayed at in Sydney, and one of the best i've seen anywhere. It has a small number of rooms with a relaxed and personable atmosphere. If you're like me and are sick of the mono-culture general hotel standard and don't wish to pay for things you don't need then this is the place for you. Stylish, well located and with and individual charm - you wont find better in Sydney.

<Content>Sydney gem: the Altamont Hotel Great staff, location (walking distance to most everything), and value! The staff really goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome and attend to your needs. Several Sydney locals to whom I showed the premises said they would stay there themselves! Wifi internet access in rooms is super-reasonable: only $25 for the length of your entire stay. Breakfast included, and available till 11 AM - which us non-earlybirds appreciated.Only drawback: poor lighting in bathroom, making shaving quite difficult.I highly recommend the Altamont!

<Content>Don麓t miss it! Like promised by the lonely planet the Altamont is really a nice and charming place to stay in Sydney ;o) Our modern room was lovely furnished and the pure bath design was - especially for me as interior architect - an eye-catcher (even though the complete bath was flood after showering). We specially enjoyed the relaxed ambience while having breakfast - thank you so much for the lovely background music!Located in Darlinghurst and next to Kings Cross you will find a lot of tasteful and interesting stores for shopping as well as excellent eateries and bars around - so don麓t miss the Altamont!See you in Sydney...

<Content>Enjoyed the Altamont Hotel  The Altamont Hotel is a great place to stay if you are looking for a budget hotel with very comfortable arrangements, a extremely nice and helpful staff AND a great location in a funky and alive part of Sydney (Darlinghurst  Kings Cross) only about a 25-30 minute walk (or short City bus ride) to the main Sydney attractions  tourist traps in Circular Quay (The Rocks, Sydney Harbor Bridge and Opera House). FYI: All tourist hop-on/hop-off buses do pick up very close by in Kings Cross. The bed and sheets were very comfortable and the morning breakfast was simple (juice, coffee, cereal, fresh fruit, toast), but a great start to the day. The rooms were quiet and clean. The main thing to remember is this is not the Hilton or an expensive hotel so expectation levels should be set accordingly. That being said, for less than $140 AU, The Altamont Hotel is well worth it! I would recommend the hotel to travelers who can relate to my review and like to experience neighborhoods and restaurants/bars outside the downtown tourist traps. I would definitely stay here again unless I felt like spending $300-$400 on a room right on the Harbor or something. :)

<Content>Nice hotel in a big city My husband and I stayed at The Altamont for the first few days of our trip to Australia. Our room was at the very back so nice and quiet. It's a reasonable size, simply decorated and clean. The bathroom was painted black I think to be 'different' but it just meant that it was hard to see clearly in there! Darlinghurst is a lovely area with loads of pubs and cafes. It's a short walk to Kings Cross metro station or you can walk down the hill into the city if you want some exercise! Our friend who lives in Sydney visited us in our room and he wasn't too impressed with the place but I think the thing to remember is like any big city, you get what you pay for! We stayed at The Vibe Hotel on Goulbourn Street for the last few days of our trip and while this was $40 more a night it had a 'hotel' feel to it which was sometimes missing from The Altamont which I guess is why it's classed as a 'luxury BB' instead! If you want to save a few dollars but still stay somewhere decent then you'll enjoy it here.

<Content>Liked some of it, disliked other We stayed at the Altamont for 3 nights on a recommendation from a friend who lives in Sydney. For the price I guess it was ok, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. However, this was the only hotel we stayed in for the whole month where we saw cockroaches (only 3). This was probably because the cleaning staff left the courtyard door open and all the lights on every day - as we were out sightseeing until after dark this meant they were attracted in! The other problem for me was that the light in the bathroom was very very dim, and the plugs were nowhere near a mirror in the bedroom, making it difficult to dry and straighten my hair, and difficult to put my make up on.On the whole I thought this hotel was ok, but my other half hated it.

<Content>location and friendly staff The hotel was great for us . The rooms were very clean , and a really great bed. The staff were really friendly as were the dogs , and having good food areas recomended was a real plus. On our 1st day the staff recommended a senic route into the city , and it was so wow , 30 minutes through the park and we were at circular key . We went to Bondi , which was 30 minutes from the hotel via the train and bus and cost us $7.20 , so the location is great . Breakfast was very relaxed and informal , and also a nice way to start the day. Internet was free , and was excellant . On our last day the hotel arranged a taxi , and told us where to tell the driver to go , so it saved us money returning to the airport. overall a very nice , clean and comfortable hotel which both myself and my enjoyed. we will stay here again if in Sydney , and would recommend it.

<Content>Great base for exploring Sydney We stayed twice at the Altamont during our recent trip down under. The first time to get over jet lag before travelling round a bit; the second time at the end of our holiday to explore Sydney. It's a small, unpretentious hotel outside the main tourist area which means it is either an easy 10-15 minute walk from Hyde Park or a very convenient train ride out to Kings Cross station, located near the hotel. There is a wide selection of good restaurants within a short walk of the hotel.The rooms are well equipped and have really comfortable, large beds - so much better than the other places we stayed while in Oz! The hotel is very relaxed and unstuffy - we found the staff to be both friendly and helpful throughout our stay. We will definitely go back to the Altamont next time we're in Sydney.

<Content>Cheap,central location The Altamont is a slightly tired boutique hotel.It has a good location near some excellent cafes and restaurants in Victoria Street. Its a half hour walk to Circular Quay area or to Harbourside, but there is a metro station nearby, and plenty of reasonable taxis. The reception is friendly and helpful. We had a largish room for three with a door onto the large roof area, which is ideal for an evening glass of wine, and cool breeze. The room was interesting,but slightly faded,in common with rest of the hotel, but I would have no hesitation in reccommending it to the budget traveller.

<Content>Relaxation and friendliness paramount at the Altamont We stayed at the hotel for 9 days and had a thoroughly enjoyable time. Alan, the host, and his staff couldn't have been more helpful. The room that we were given was fairly spacious and the bathroom had a great shower. The bed was also very comfortable. There is also a great roof garden to relax in. The staff helped us with tips for places to eat and drink as well as identifying other key facilities ie post office. Nothing was too much trouble. If there was one thing that would improve the stay it would be if the lighting in the bathroom was stronger as we found that shadows made shaving difficult.This is a great hotel to stay at in central sydney and offers great value for money.

<Content>Altamont Forever! We spent two weeks in this wonderful hotel . Although it is located very close to Kings Cross, you don't feel disturbed or annoyed by the outgoing crowd. Rooms are good, well maintained and quiet. The staff were very helpful and real heroes of the reception desk , Alan and Sam, are very nice people to talk. They provided every information you'll need in Sydney and have been very helpful to guests. Room prices are reasonable and you'll never find a better place to stay in Sydney.

<Content>Awesome! I stayed at the Altamont two times, from Sep to Oct and at the end of Jan 2008.I loved both of the stays. The service is really nice, all staff is friendly and kind and I had a lot of fun. Mr Morris gave me a lot of information regarding the whole sightseeing around Sydney and i totally enjoyed my holiday!The hotel is in the middle of everything!!!Because of the fact that this hotel is placed in Kings Cross, it麓s very easy to get to the main points of this beautiful city. You can just take the train to the Opera House, Harbor Bridge, Botanical Gardens and it takes you less than 10 minutes. The room was very clean and it had everything you can possibly ask for. Besides, if you don麓t want to go sightseeing, you can just relax on the magnificient roof top with its view over one skyline-part and also nice plants and trees around you. The whole atmosphere was very familiar and I would love to stay there next time again because I really look forward to!Thanks very much for having me and take care!

<Content>Fantastic location, super value hotel! With the US dollar reaching parity with the Aussie dollar, we tried our best to save some money during our week in Sydney by booking a stay at the Altamont. SO WORTH IT. First off, we loved Darlinghurst - the neighborhood was so well placed, I don't think I'd ever stay anywhere else. The hotel itself was fantastic. Alan, Sam, and the staff were so wonderful and nice. We got a loft room with sky high ceilings. The room was clean and well equipped with a dvd player and a couch to relax. The bathroom was a decent size - I've had more water pressure in my life, but it was really fine. Definitely definitely a find in Sydney! We would recommend this place to everyone. Just make sure there's room for us when we come back...

<Content>As good as ever My girlfriend and I have stayed at the Altamont five times now (combination of leisure and business). As ex-residents of Sydney we appreciate being close to the restaurants, shops and cinemas of Darlinghurst/ Paddington, as well as Bondi Beach and the CBD. Fantastic location, clean and simple rooms with plenty of natural light, friendly service and excellent value for money (most Australian hotels don't include breakfast). All topped off by the recent addition of wireless broadband! We'll be staying again next time...

<Content>Friendly Staff I stayed for 9 nights at The Altamont and was welcomed by all from the moment I arrived.The staff were friendly and the resident 2 dogs were very happy to see a new face and eagerly came over to be patted!During my stay I unfortunately had an eye infection, a recurrance from a bug I had contracted in India while there the previous month. I sought advice from the hotel staff and asked for them to suggest an appropriate GP.Alan was very helpful in recommending a local Medical Centre and was genuinely interested in my wellbeing throughout my stay.Also the bloke who cleaned my room (never got his name) asked me daily if I were ok.As I was travelling alone and was far away from family and friends (in the UK) having an eye infection resulted in me feeling somewhat sorry for myself at times.The reception I received from the staff at The Altamont made me feel a whole lot better and not so isolated.I suppose in the long run it's the little things that people do that make a difference to how we feel,and all the staff put in the effort to make my stay a pleasant one.I would recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Left here rather dissapointed... more a costly budget hotel than boutique. I stayed here with my boyfriend for 5 nights, thoroughly looking forward to my stay in the 'boutique hotel'... especially after the positively glowing reviews here. I have to say however, I was left feeling rather dissapointed. The location is very central- you can easily access all districts from here, however to get down to CBD (Opera House/Harbour) you need to catch the metro (approx 15/20 mins due to change of trains). The nearest metro station is Kings Cross, which is a very shady part of Sydney indeed. In fact it did become quite intimidating walking down 'the strip' during the night time (prostitutes/drug dealers)- however many police were about, which is reassuring. But in the end we mostly ended up taking taxis. The hotel itself was like stated by other users here- very homely, but the owner was not as friendly as I was lead to believe from the other reviews (I felt even abrupt on a few occasions). We stayed in a deluxe room costing $145 AUD/night, which in my opinion is on the costly side, even though it is supposed to be budget boutique. The rooms were an average size,not large, but not small. The bathroom was better (just as in the candid review photographs posted), but the shower did not have a door/curtain and water did get everywhere- there is a drain, but still not ideal at all. Also the fridge is in the bathroom, which I thought could be a hazzard since water got everywhere!I think this is a good place if you are coming with a group of friends and stay in a family room, as these rooms are larger and are overall alot cheaper (in fact they cost only a few dollars more than the deluxe room), but I dont reccommed otherwise. There is also a bar in the reception area, but this closes very early around 6pm.... luckily there is a liquor store next door if you need, and lots of convience stores for food. In the end though the appearance is more budget than boutique. I ended up feeling that I would have been better off staying in a 3/4* near the CBD for the same price.

<Content>Fab and conveniently located Sydney hotel This hotel is fab! Highly recommended! You get a very friendly, efficient welcome, every staff member I met was helpful and professional. Its in a nice residential part of Sydney, incredibly central yet not on a majorly busy city road (15-20mins walk to heart of city, harbours, museums). The room I stayed in had glass patio doors with a little outdoor space with large container plants, a huge and comfortable bed, powerful shower in big bathroom, with fridge and air con, hair dryer etc. It was spotlessly cleaned daily (- except when I said not to worry in order to do my bit on an environmental level!) It has a bar, and more fun - a huge roof terrace! (Good to be able to have a fag for all us terrible smokers!) I was given a good deal pricewise because I stayed 11 days. Its also got character, not a bland modern hotel, but you feel that care has been taken to furnishthe public areas with old bits and pieces. For art lovers its practically next door to one of the best places to buy Aboriginal artwork too, and very near to a great 50 yr old coffee house called Coluzzo's!

<Content>at home rather than a hotel We booked two rooms for 4 nights. One Loft room one deluxe room. Both types are really nice, bathrooms are spacious with great design. The loft room was our favourite room. The hotel is in a perfect location. Great for sightseeing, whether you麓d like to walk or take public transport, in a good location to walk to restaurants and bars in the evening and still the rooms are quiet since they do not face the front street. The hotel is designed in a modern style, yet very comfortable and creates a cosy atmosphere. And it is a boutique hotel for sure - boutique in a way of small, private, and individual nice design and that what it is. If people expect one of those i like it white, all sterile type of place - no it麓s not that. It still got character and atmosphere. The staff is very helpful and easy going. The rooms have a very good size, much better then most of the 4 or even some 5 star hotels (compared with their standard rooms and their prices!) - and are decorated so that one does not feel like in an ordinary hotel room, rather feels like home. Which is very nice, especially when you have done a lot of travelling already.... and finally the value for money is just excellent. will stay here for sure again on our next visit to Sydney.Thanks a lot to Alan and his staff.

<Content>fantastic gem in a fun neighborhood sorry for the delay in posting, i've been away. we stayed during the australian winter for about a week. at the time we made the booking (note the altamont is quite popular, so book in advance!) we were deciding between darlinghurst and the rocks. having spend a considerable amount of time in both neighborhoods, we were glad to picked darlinghurst. we were hoping to stay in one of the more upscale boutiques, but they were already full and we decided based on the tripadvisor reviews to try the altamont.the altmont is fabulous and we were so pleased to have gotten such a great deal. the rooms are incredibly reasonably priced, the location is excellent for bars and restaurants, but what really made the experience special was allen at the front desk, who has a wealth of knowledge. he was able to direct us on all the tourist attractions, offering practical and helpful advice. he also had excellent restaurant recommendations that beat our guidebooks hands down. allen was friendly without being intrusive.all in all a great find. we travel extensively and always like to check out hotels. this was a surefire winner, and you really can't beat the price or location.

<Content>More Budget than Boutique but still a good spot Stayed here for 6 nights in early October. I agree with other reviewers about the location - the neighbourhood is lovely and has lots of lovely restaurants and cafes in the vicinity to suit all budgets. It's also easy to reach the rest of the city by bus and train and just a few minutes walk to the gay nightlife of Oxford Street. The staff were really helpful and the service personal. A few little things were more hostel like than boutique hotel: the continental breakfast was simply toast and corn flakes - and instant coffee ! In a city where coffee is taken very seriously this seemed unforgivable. Just as well there are so many good cafes nearby!

<Content>Great Sydney Hotel! We stayed at the Altamont for almost a week in July and definitely had a great time. It is located in Darlinghurst which is a great neighborhood to wonder around- there are plenty of great restaurants and shops just around the corner. In addition to the great location, another highlight was the staff- they were always there to give us advice on the neighborhood and the city in general, whether it be their favorite restaurants and shops, or what tours to take. We ate at several restaurants which they recommended and they were great!The actual hotel is a small boutique-type place with just a handful of rooms. Our room had one big bedroom and one very large bathroom. The bathroom had modern-style finishings (black tile everywhere) and the bedroom was just a large unassuming room with a TV and basic amenities. Basic breakfast was included. Also, we loved the dogs that lived in the lobby- they were very friendly and not-at-all overbearing or nosy.Even without considering the price per night, this hotel had everything we were looking for- nice ambiance, nice location, nice and very helpful staff, included breakfast, and even some dogs. When you consider the price, it made staying here for a whole week all the better- it was a great value and experience! We wish the Altamont and its staff all the best!

<Content>Sydney chic We started our honeymoon in Oz by staying at the Altamont Hotel located in the Kings Cross area of Sydney. We chose this place based on the very positive reviews we had read on Tripadvisor from other guests. The hotel itself is a lovely 'boutique' hotel situated near all of the action (should you want it) of Oxford Street and Kings Cross generally - although its side street location means the hotel itself is very peaceful. From the hotel we often walked into Circular Quay/Botanical gardens which took about 25 mins - on the way back we sometimes caught the frequent local buses.The rooms are very stylishly decked out - exposed brick walls, cool lighting etc with good sized bathrooms and great showers. In fact we loved the understated cool of the room we were in and it was very comfortable. The whole place has a relaxed and friendly air about it and the staff are very helpful and friendly.We thoroughly recommend this hotel - you will not be disappointed if you stay here, unless you like the big chain hotel style in which case it may seem a little too cosy for your liking. In terms of price and cool this place is spot on ,and we will definitely stay here again when we eventually get round to going back to Sydney.

<Content>What it says on the tin! This hotel is described as bugdet luxury and I would agree. We stayed here for 4 nights on our way around the world. My favourite place we visited was Sydney and the Altamont was a really nice hotel.It is quite a very small place which I hadn't really expected but the staff were nice and friendly. The room was a good size with a little shared patio outside, the room was clean and had good facilities. Breakfast was a very simple affair but for the price we couldn't expect more. Darlinghurst is a slightly dodgy area but we never had any problems, we enjoyed staying there and made good use of the cafes and gellato shops. The hotel is only 5 minutes from the local train station so its easy to get around the city.Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Altamont does it right! My husband and I like to stay in boutique hotels and B  B's when we travel international. The Altamont has everything you would hope for in a hotel. Location, cleanliness, affordability, and a staff at their best. Alan and Sam were always available to answer our questions; they treated us as if you were a guest in their home. We could easily walk to anywhere in Sydney we wanted to go, and the restaurants around the hotel were terrific. Alan's a great reference for restaurant info. The room we stayed in was very clean, and the bed very comfortable. My husband loved the powerful shower. The continental breakfast was all you needed to get your day going. It as nice to have a washer and dryed on site to do your laundry. The price was the icing on the cake. Also the fellows at the liquor store next door are fun to shoot the breeze with; they have some info for you too. If you don't stay at the Altamont when you're in Sydney, you've missed out on a great experience. In years to come if we're able to survive the 28 hour travel time from the States; we'll certainly book ourselves into the Altamont.

<Content>Awesome family stay From the moment we arrived, Alan greeted us with a friendly smile and as we arrived earlier than the usual 2pm check in time he was happy to stow our bags until we could be checked in.Last year we stayed in Darling Harbour and as we wanted to show our children some of the sights we'd seen and experience some new ones without getting lost both Alan and Sam were always on hand to give us directions complete with map and transport suggestions. Each morning after a leisurely breakfast in the attrium where we sat watching some of Sydney strolling by we set off on our own adventures. Each night we returned to the hotel always to a friendly welcoming smile .The room was large cosy and comfortable with a huge king sized bed for us and 2 sets of bunk beds for the kids , the rooftop courtyard where we sat and enjoyed a cool drink after a hot day of sightseeing was an added bonus. Our family really enjoyed our stay with Alan and Sam and would recommend their hotel to anyone wanting a friendly home away from home.For a family travelling on a modest budget $138 per night was certainly very reasonable ! To be honest I didnt want to leave !

<Content>Truly excellent As a family with a teenage daughter visiting Sydney as tourists from Europe we were looking for a relaxed hotel close to the heart of the city and within a lively caf茅/restaurant area for spending the evenings away from the immediate center. Being in the Darlinghurst/Kings Cross district the Altamont therefore proved to be perfect - about 1.5 km walk to the CBD, 5 minutes walk to Kings Cross station for getting around more quickly or to wider destinations when needed, and a great choice of restaurants, caf茅s and pubs on the doorstep.The hotel itself is a wonderfully individual mix of modern and traditional with real flair in what appears to be a revamped former 3-storey villa with a delightful and spacious steel and glass reception/lounge added at the front. Our room was also spacious and full of light and the extensive roof terrace was a joy. The service was outstanding. A genuinely friendly and relaxed atmosphere in combination with close attention to our every need made our stay a pleasure. Simply great value.

<Content>Altamont Experience Loved our six day stay at the Altamont. It advertises as 'luxury budget' and we certainly agree. We found it a nice bonus to have our room serviced to a high standard each day of our stay. The quietness of the room allowed us a good night's sleep even though we were in close proximity to central Kings Cross. We were impressed with the helpfulness of the staff, who were always willing to help with directions and other travel advice. Loved the general ambience of theplace and found it a pleasure to eat breakfast while reading the paper and listening to the great selection of music being played. Will certainly be returning!

<Content>Unbeatable! We stayed at this boutique hotel for a week in September 2007 and just loved it! The personal 'home-away-from-home' service was really special and the intimate size and great location of the hotel (suburban but literally on the doorstep of fantastic nightlife and restaurants) really gave us a taste of living as a Sydney-sider rather than as a mere tourist in an impersonal, large hotel. Our room was well-sized and spotlessly maintained, and the breakfast room is sunny with an open outlook onto the suburb of Darlinghurst. The hotel was just a short walk from the train station, as well as bus routes - whilst also being an easy, pleasant walk from the city centre.We were really impressed by the incredibly friendly, helpful staff; the great location; the value-for-money aspect; and the atmosphere of this hotel and would recommend it highly.

<Content>The Altamont Hotel First impressions of hotel: A small old hotel now chain-owned. Rooms: Terrible. Ancient furniture and TV. Filthy. Bathroom had smeared tiles. We didn't look forward to returning to our rooms at night after a day of touring.Beds: Okay. Went to the liquor store, made a few drinks and slept well. Breakfast: Almost nothing. Service: Average. Location: Didn't work for us. Too far away from everything. Verdict: Unless it was a very very good deal, we would not go here again.

<Content>The area of urban cool The altamont is a laid back hotel, perfect for bustling Sydney. After a busy day full of sightseeing you can go back and relax in your huge bed, with tv, coffee and tea facilities and a fridge ( perfect for chilling wine from the bottle shop next door!). The hotel is in prime location - short walk from Kings cross station, a leisurely walk to Harry's pie cart in Woolamaloo, botanical gargens/opera house and near to a great nightlife. Situated in Darlinghirst, right on the doorstep are many great bars, restaurants and take aways. Bills restaurant for a fab, hearty breakfast was one of our favourites, as was the S.Tarda Thai restaurant and The Darlo bar. The Breakfast at the Atlamont compliments the hotels laid back style - juice, tea  coffee, cereal and toast. Help yourself and relax reading the newspapers. Any time of the morning - no rush. This is perfect for the traveller that wants luxury on a budget.This was our second time there and when we go back to Sydney it will defiantly be our first choice for accomodation.

<Content>A nice place to stay! I stayed here a couple of times over a three week period, and both times I was warmly welcomed by the owner, Alan, and his two very friendly dogs!I found the hotel to be very comfortable, excellent value for money, and in a good location for getting out and about in Sydney. Also, there are plenty of places to eat and drink near the hotel.The two rooms I stayed in were of a good size, clean and quiet. The beds were comfortable, and I had no problems in getting to sleep.Overall, if you're looking for an inexpensive, relaxed and comfortable place to stay in Sydney, you can't do much better than the Altamont Hotel!

<Content>It's a no go! A drab, dark and depressing hotel with an odor of animal, mould and old perfume. Floor un-hoovered. Bedspread stained. Handprints on the wall. Furnishings dusty and tired with a few cigarette burns here and there. Bathroom in need of urgent refurbishment. No toilettries. Toast with marmelade or peanut butter, cereal, milk, orange juice and coffe/tea for breakfast.

<Content>Might be okay on a budget... Good location, great neighborhood. The hotel looked very good online and had a certain Bohemian chic to it in person. The bed itself was spacious, comfortable and clean.The room in general also seemed clean, but the mold in the bathroom was so overwhelming we had to check out early to avoid it affecting my husband's allergies and asthma. Manager gave us no problems over our early check out.

<Content>A Breath of Fresh Air in a Big City The Altamont Hotel - Sydney - A Breath of Fresh Air in a Big CityHow deliciously refreshing to arrive at the Altamont Hotel and be met by two adoreable friendly dogs and their gracious owner....The Altamont is a total contrast to most big city hotels. With a relaxed and personal welcome, spacious rooms artistically and stylishly decorated with an Indonesian theme and gorgeous large, comfy beds, the Altamont evokes the feeling of arriving home to your own apartment. There is an informal foyer/lounge area to enjoy a leisurely breakfast and a roof top garden - the perfect spot to peruse a new novel with a glass of Vino.Located in Darlinghurst, the Altamont proved the perfect location for my visit - a brief taxi ride to my business activities at Moore Park and yet a comfortable walk to George Street.And then there is the tariff - so reasonable !The Altamont will certainly be my choice for my next visit to Sydney...Michelle BakerNew Zealand

<Content>Fun place in a lively locale The Hotel Altamont isn't super-posh, but it is super-cool. Located in Sydney's hip Darlinghurst neighborhood, just across the boulevard from the seedy streets of Kings Cross, the Altamont is outside of the main tourist hub -- and that's a good thing. You'll be within close walking distance of the city's main attractions, but you'll go home to an area near trendy restaurants and bars and a more lively nightlife. And that's way more fun than lolling around with the masses in the Rocks. As other commenters have noted, the furnishings could use some updating, but we did find the Altamont to be entirely clean and comfortable. What's more, the hotel staff was genuinely friendly and responsive. They gave us lots of good tips on the neighborhood and the city. What's more, when a toilet stopped up, they had a plumber in promptly to repair it. Ask for a room in the back, as Darlinghurst Road can get busy. And be sure not to miss out on the stunning hidden roof garden, which none of the other guests seemed to use. You get a lovely view of downtown, and it's a fantastic place to start the morning with the paper and a cup of tea. In terms of cost-to-quality ratio, this place is a winner. We'll be back.

<Content>Overpriced We stayed at this dump in May after coming across it online. It look beautiful on the web and we were so excited because it seemed like an inexpensive (129$) boutique hotel. Sad to say, it turned out to be a disappointment. Stay if you have to, but don't expect to enjoy it. From reading about the hotel you get the impression that it is something extraordinary. It's not.The hotel is very basic and run down. I cleaned myself the bathroom, it was really in need of renovation. Our biggest complaint was the uncomfortable bed with worn bedding. The carpet was old and frayed. The TV reception was limited. We didn't want to risk using the tea facilities. They were cheap on towels and provided no soap, shampoo was not replaced.Also, don't count on the breakfast, which consisted of watery coffee and dry toast. Location is good if you want to party, otherwise it's too far from the harbour. Comparatively this is a overpriced hotel that doesn't really deserve any attention. I'm not the sort of person that write a review but after this I'll be glad if this puts someone off going there. What was otherwise a lovely stay in a pleasant city with nice people was marred by this below mediocre hotel.

<Content>A great value! My family of four stayed at the Altamont for a total of 5 nights in July and August of 2007. The family room was spacious, with plenty of room to stretch out. We enjoyed the access to the roof terrace, a great place to unwind in the afternoon sun. We took advantage of the breafast 2 or 3 mornings, finding it adequate and similar to what we usually eat at home. We loved the location, close to shops, restaurants, and train. Some of the furnishings were a bit worn, but overall, the room and hotel were very comfortable. Alan and Sam were very helpful. Prior to arrival, I had worries about the red light district reputation of the area, but my 17 and 20 year old kids had no problems or worries. We stayed 4 nights upon our arrival in Sydney, and then 1 night two weeks later after our travels around Australia. The family was excited to be going back to the Altamont for our final night in Sydney. If you require a business type hotel, this isn't it. If you want something more comfortable and personal, you've found it.

<Content>Ultimate @ Altamont A great place to stay....Convenient to transport options and within easy walking distance of the City. A light breakfast and a newspaper were a great way to start the day. And after an intense day of touristing and shopping we could return to a cleaned room with the most wonderful fresh crisp linen every day. Many cafes and restaurants are nearby or a short cab trip to anywhere else. Hosts Alan and Sam were very helpful to all their guests and nothing was any trouble at all. Overall it was a convenient and comfortable experience with a friendly edge.

<Content>terrible reception service! The hotel is very charming but the service is almost brutal. I dared asking why was I charged 139 instead of the advertised 109 and the man at the reception instead of answering me walked to my son of 4 playing at the pool table and grabbed the ball he was playing with saying babies can't use it. He never bothered answering to me, he just walked away. The third bed in the bedroom wasn't made on arrival, on asking if it could be made we only found the sheets on top of the bed and had to make it ourselves. We received only two towels for three people and no bath mat, one key for 3 people, the room is cold for our standards, I'd say about 18 degrees and internet wireless reception in room 9 is almost nihl (although we're charged for it).Yes it's charming and beautifully done, but I'm not happy nor would I suggest it.Guglielmoh

<Content>Sydney ant our feet We (18 year old daughter, partner and I) stayed at the Altamont Hotel, Sydney, for a week this July (2007).This was our first trip to Australia and our first port of call in the country, so impressions were important.I would recommend the Altamont to the independent traveller. All staf were friendly, welcoming and helpful. The hotel was comfortable and spotlessly clean and I really liked its individual style in terms of decor and furnishing.It's well placed within easy walking distance of every main attraction that Sydney has to offer, and from several different directions, following a variety of routes into town, maximizing exploring potential. We took full advantage of this, visiting galleries, museums, bookshops, the Aquarium, Opera House, taking shopping and boating trips.The hotel is located near to grocery stores, a laundry, and more international restaurants than I have seen anywhere else on my travels.I would certainly stay at the hotel again because of its comfort, friendliness of staff, location and value for money. My one suggestion for improvement would be that breakfast could be more imaginative and varied.

<Content>Highly recommended - A home away from home The Altamont is truely an exclusive boutique hotel, located in the hub of Sydney's famous restaurants, bars, clubs and only minutes walk to the famous Oxford street and Kings Cross. Cleanliness and hospitality are their top priority, the rooms are spacesious and the bathrooms very modern. Since our stay in April 2007, we are returning now for the third time as it feels like home away from home at the hotel. The staff makes your comfort their top priority and geniunely cares about your needs. We can highly recommend the Altamont to fellow travellers.

<Content>The only place I will stay in Sydney I have to say that the Altamont Hotel is one of the most charming hotels I have stayed at in my life. From the moment I walked in the door I was made to feel welcome (as a dog-lover, it was always nice to be greeted by Alan's dogs after a long day walking the city). What the Altamont manages to do, which so many other hotels fail to do, is that you actually feel a part of the place regardless of how short your stay is. Much of this is down to Alan and his staff who will bend over backwards to make your time spent there worthwhile. Whether it be giving advice on day trips or even just recommending local restaurants, Alan is your man. As for the hotel itself, the rooms are extremely comfortable (I particularly liked my little courtyard) and certainly are way beyond what you would normally get for this price in Sydney. Yes, there is a (little) wear and tear on some of the furnishings, but you would really have to be rather harsh to mark the hotel down for such a small matter. The rooms are extremely comfortable, spotlessly clean and the showers are absolutely to die for. In terms of the location, I can only agree with previous reviewers in that I think there is probably no better place to stay in Sydney. You have the mad nightlife of Kings Cross literally a 2 minute walk from the front door and yet the area the hotel is in is completely safe and you are guaranteed a quiet night's sleep. You also have absolutely brilliant transport connections nearby with the underground a 2-minute walk away. In short, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the Altamont hotel and suffice to say it will quite simply be the only place I will ever stay on future visits to Sydney, of which I hope there will be many.

<Content>Great service We found the hotel convenient for great restaurants and transport. We were disappointed with the tiredness of the furnishings, but our room was clean and spacious, with lots of hot water, a good heater and air conditioner and a more than adequate breakfast , all at a fair price.Especially of note was the service we received from Alan and Sam. On arrival, we found our room had been used previously by a smoker (despite the non-smoking sign on the table), which was no fault of the management. Our TV was working at first but decided to 'give up the ghost' within an hour. Again, something which could not have been foreseen by the hotel management. The next day, we were moved to another room, where everything was fine. At the end of our stay Alan kindly gave us a reduced rate to make amends for our inconvenience. Alan was very personable and charming and nothing was too much trouble. He gave us lots of advice about where to eat and how to get to places, which made our stay more enjoyable: A convenient, clean, friendly place to stay.B and M: Geelong

<Content>Amazing Altamont Why would you want to stay any where else in Sydney? A fine, friendly, affordable and beautifully pointed boutique hotel located in Sydney's favourite district. With neighboring shops and eateries galore and within easy walking distance to the city, the harbour and university, this hotel is Sydney's best kept secret. Many thanks Altamont for your fantastic hospitality.

<Content>Wonderfully located I visited Sydney on business and needed to stay at a place which was centrally located but not too noisy. With a raft of transport options close to this hotel it proved to be ideal. Twice I walked out of the hotel and was able to hail a taxi within 10 secs! And it is right in the heart of a fashionable cafe district with many bars and restaurants within a stones throw. The service also proved to superb, and the overall experience very favourable. I shall be returning. Stephen Murdoch

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed here with a friend for a fortnight in June and honestly could not fault the hotel. It is situated in an ideal location, within walking distance of all of Sydney's main attractions. Darling Harbour, Sydney's nicest area is a half hour walk through the city centre. Hyde Park and Botanic gardens are 10 minutes away, The Rocks is a 45 minute walk, The Opera House half an hour and the town centre and CBD less than that. Also near the hotel is the lively Kings Cross area which never closes (although the hotel is located just far enough away that it isn't noisy) and many great restaurants and bars which Alan who runs the hotel was more than happy to recommend. In the two weeks we stayed the only time we used public transport was to travel out of Sydney once for the Blue Mountains and also to the airport. Even Bondi beach is only a 2 hour brisk and enjoyable walk from the hotel.The hotel itself far exceeded our expectations. A hidden gem of a hotel that could easily charge far more than it does (it costs less than some hostels!). It is small and friendly with lots of little extra touches in decor and amenities that make it just that bit more special. The reception/lounge area is at once warm and friendly with a very nice atmosphere. There is a small bar and pool table which is nice if you are just wanting a quiet afternoon or night in, and a breakfast bar with cereals and toast to start the day. The rooms themselves are clean and nicely decorated, and surprisingly spacious for a small hotel.Adding to the friendly atmosphere of the hotel are the staff who are all incredibly helpful. The owner Alan was always offering us excellent advice for where to eat or places to visit, and him and the staff just added to our excellent holiday. All in all I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. Excellent for a short or long term stay, you would struggle to find a nicer hotel in Sydney, and especially not for the price of the AltamontChris

<Content>Great experience at the Altamont My girlfriend and I recently spent a week at the Altamont. After spending three weeks in a camper-van, we were thrilled with the brilliant shower and comfortable bed. We were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of all the staff. Alan and Sam were very helpful in choosing restaurants and giving advice for activities; they showed genuine interest in our comfort and wellbeing. This hotel gives a more personal experience than one would have at a larger, corporate one. The location is also quite convenient, near the Kings Cross station. I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone who would like a positive lodging experience that will not cost an arm and a leg!

<Content>'Luxury Budget Hotel' Our group decided to try Hotel Altamont because of the cheap nightly rates. We had 5 people staying at the hotel and we only paid $137 per night ($28 per person per night), which is actually cheaper then staying at backpackers. Upon arriving, we were surpised to see a small yet cozy hotel and were greeted upon by the friendly manager.We stayed upstairs where the room was very large and the bathroom was well presented. Another door also connected our room to the rooftop area which was an extra bonus!We were definitely pleased with the service and with such a well presented hotel and the cheap rates we got more than we bargined for!The hotel was only 3 minutes walk to the Kings Cross railway station which was really convenient and the hotel was located in a very safe area.We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! Thanks again to the staff at Altamont!

And I would like to thank them for their kindness!Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Altamont hotel, and will definetely choose to stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic Boutique Hotel We booked a stay in this hotel for 5 days and both found the staff and facilties to be off an exceptional nature. The staff were very friendly, helpful and non-intrusive, while the accommodation was of aunique style, perfectly suited for a getaway with a partner. Therooms were clean, comfortable and the courtyard was a great addition.The continental breakfast was a great start to a day of sightseeing and shopping, all which were located within easy walking distance. The Altamont is a hotel in which we will definitely stay again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Sydney who are looking for a well located, friendly and unique hotel.

<Content>My Home in Sydney I travel to Sydney 2-3 times per year for work and occasionally for pleasure and the Altamont Hotel is always my first choice for accommodation. I have probably stayed there on 10 separate occasions over the last 3-4 years.Apart from being in a great position for both work and play and easily accessed (a few minutes walk from Kings Cross Station, 15 minute walk to the city centre and cabs always about on Darlinghurst Rd), the Altamont has a relaxed and friendly vibe. The rooms are uncluttered, with lovely big, comfortablebeds and spacious bathrooms. A comfortable and unpretentious stay waits you. Rates are modest and good value. The roof top garden is a pleasant place to catch some sun and listen to the sounds of the city.Staff are unobtrusive, but extremely friendly and approachable and Alan's dogs are always up for a pat!Enjoy your stay...... I always do.

<Content>A very pleasant experience We booked the Altamont because of the good reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. The location was ideal- a five minute walk to Kings Cross station and lots of good cafes. (Thanks for some great suggestiions Allan!) Ambience was comfortable, casual and friendly, we were very happy with our room and the only negative was the gloomy lighting in the bathroom. A refreshing change from impersonal city hotels and with make-your-own breakfast thrown in, great value. I would definitely stay again.

<Content>Our Altamont Festival Arriving early on a Saturday morning, my wife and I were able to store our bags at the nearby hotel down the street until the Altamont opened its doors. At 8 am Alan unlocked the front door and we checked in.Alan is everyone's dream hotelier; a combination of manager, concierge and confidant. We felt welcome from the start. Of course when a hotel costs half as much as the nearest competition, one wonders what the catch is. There really is no catch. The furnishings are not lush but certainly adequate. The hotel is clean and well run.There is a front reception area which is quite large. It is a sort of combination, living room, lounge bar and billiards area. When Alan is on duty, delightful music from the past is played. Very relaxing.The actual room in which we stayed was not going to win any prizes in Architectural Digest. It was however clean, quite spacious and held a queen-sized bed. There is an en suite bath with a shower. The shower had good hot water and a strong stream and the shower head is highly enough placed that a tall person can shower without having to duck down.There was a TV which seemed to get the standard 5 Sydney stations. The room also had an electric tea pot and plenty of tea and coffee available for waking up in the morning for free. Once one gets up he or she can go out to the front reception area and sit at one of the tables and have some cereal (corn flakes or rice krispies), bread (white or whole wheat), various spreads like butter, peanut butter, jelly, honey, or that Australian spread know as Vegemite. There is hot tea and coffe available (free also). In the evening one can enjoy a glass of wine or a beer there also.The hotel is only about a 5 minute stroll away from the Kings Cross train station. Another 5 minute stroll gets you to the bus stop. From one of these, you can get anywhere in Sydney.The greates thing about the location is that by cutting through the parking lot across the street to Victoria Street, you are immediately in the midst of restaurant row. There are some very fine places to dine there each night and all within 5 minutes stroll of the hotel.I think if I were a consumer magazine, I would rate this hotel a best buy. It has the combination of inexpensive rates (be aware if you are from the USA that Sydney is much more expensive than anywhere in America), excellent management (Alan), and proximity to whatever you want to get to in Sydney.We would stay there again. I hope we can someday.

<Content>Great Little Hotel Our visit to Sydney was for a week so we wanted to stay in a place that was comfortable for a reasonable price. We also wanted to be close to public transport. The Altamont provided these requirements. It was made enjoyable by the genuine hospitality of the owner and staff, not the forced courtesey found in larger establishments. We had a really fun experience. Thoroughly recommended for non-conservative types.

<Content>Great budget hotel, wonderful staff This is a great hotel. I stayed in a double room with a private bathroom and terrace. A great value for an expensive city. The front area has a wonderful atmosphere, with comfy couches, a pool table and a bar. The staff was very friendly and helpful, with great recommendations, including the best restaurants in the area, tourist attractions, and movie thearter. Thanks to Alan and Robbie for an awesome time in Sydney.

<Content>Perfect Altamont The Altamont Hotel was perfect for our weekend in Sydney. It is a small boutique hotel run by a friendly man called Alan who is very helpful. In the heart of Darlinghurst, it is perfectly located close to cafes, bars and pubs along with nearby rail stations and the central business district. The Altamont is well priced, art deco funky, warm and inviting and I would highly recommend it for anyone considering a stay in Sydney especially if they like to be in the heart of a fun and lively suburb but also close to the cbd and local tourist attractions. An excellent choice.

<Content>A great time at the Altamont We have just returned from a great 4 day stay at the Altamont. It is a great place to stay, warm friendly staff that made you feel very welcome.Why would anyone want to stay in a 'cookie cutter' large chain hotel when you can stay at places like the Altamont. The rooms were large with a nice comfortable large bed.The Altamont is very well situated with a large range of Cafes and Bars close by. Even the centre of Sydney is only a quick stroll away.Top marks to the team at the Altamont, we will definetly be back.

<Content>Central, clean, safe, affordable and very welcoming The Altamont Hotel is everything you could imagine and more! CENTRAL - A short walk to Kings Cross nightlife and Oxford Street shopping, jump on the train and head to Circular Quay or Bondi for a bit of people watching.CLEAN - All rooms are spotless with an invisible tidy up whilst you are out and about. The room was spacious with a hip and funky touch leading to a beautiful little courtyard to enjoy a quiet cuppa.SAFE - The most important criteria is safety and the whole time i was at The Altamont i felt secure. The Hotel closes reasonably early however there is a night door which can be used.AFFORDABLE - Easily the most affordable accommodation i have ever experienced in Sydney in such a location with such ammenities and service!!HOSPITALITY - Alan and the team were always delightful when greeting you on the way in or wishing you all the best on your way out. There was nothing they couldn't help me out with (whether it be mobile phone charger or ironing board).It's not often you can walk out of a hotel and know for a fact that you will be returning to the exact same hotel next time you visit that city!

<Content>Friendly, Helpful, Peaceful, Nice What a nice little oasis is the middle of it all. We had a great experience staying at the Altamont. The staff went well above there need to help us out in every way they could. Each day we had a new need and each day they helped us solve it.The rooms are comfortable and quiet. We specifically requested a quiet room and the staff advised that we stay on the inside (courtyard) side. It was indeed quiet. The beds were well appointed with firm, qualty mattresses and the bathroom was spacious and clean.We had a lot of fun in the lobby most nights as some of the visitors would come out to chat. There were tourist from all over the world and the spirit of the Altamont brought out the best in us all.The Altamont is a great place particularly for the price!

<Content>great location, friendly staff The Altamont was truly a welcoming experience for my first trip to Sydney. The facilities are pretty standard for a budget hotel with some unexpected extras. The front room is a fun place to gather with your travel companions or friends for a game of pool and a drink, and the laundry facilities on site were a life saver! The rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable, and the staff is amazing. Alan, the owner, was a great guide and always had a smile on his face. This hotel is central to just about everything you'll want to see while in Sydney. The atmosphere of the hotel in general is pretty calm and laid back. If you want a place that feels like a home away from home while you're visiting Sydney, stay here!

<Content>Altamont: excellent! We stayed here for 9 days in April 2007. It's an excellent boutique hotel: clean, small, good value, brilliant location, very helpful staff.Room was confortable, clean and kinda cool (as are most of the rooms, by all accounts). Staff are great - very accommodating and helpful for anything we needed.Location is fab: can walk in to central Sydney in about 15-20 minutes; really close to loads and loads of restaurants, bars, etc. Very chic neighbourhood all in all. Value is fantastic. It was low priced and perfect for what we wanted (we were out sightseeing most days).And - they have wireless broadband for an all-in fee of 10 dollars! Result!

<Content>I had a great stay at Altamont! My partner and I stayed at Altamont from 26 Apr to 1 May 2007, and we highly recommend it. Here's what we loved about the place: 1. Tastefully decorated room2. Superb location3. Professional yet personal services from the Hotel Managers, Alan  Sam :o)The location, in particular, deserves elaboration. Altamont is about a 3 min walk from Kings Cross Station, in the direction of Darlinghurst Road, where it is both quiet and safe. Running parallel to this road is Victoria Street where several fabulous eateries are located - we tried the Eat Thai restaurant there, recommended by Alan, and loved it!Being at Kings Cross also means it is easy to get to Bondi beach - a MUST VISIT place for any first time visitors, subject to good weather conditions of course. And nighly pilgrimages can be made to the hangouts along Oxford Street - it's well within walking distance from the Hotel so don't miss checking it out, especially on Saturday nights ;o)Our stay at the Altamont has made this leg of our trip to Australia a memorable experience! And I highly recommend it to you :o)Eugene, Singapore

<Content>Great location We stayed here for four days during our recent visit. Alan (the manager) and Sam made us feel very at home without being overbearing. The decor is very stylish and the location was great.Lots of cafes and delis nearby and walkable to the Opera house, CBD etc. Train station and busses to Bondi beach etc are five minutes walk away too. It's also easy to find from the station which is a bonus after a long flight. As others have mentioned don't miss the roof terrace either. We'll definitely be going back when we return to Sydney next month.

<Content>Urban Sydney at its best! A home from home - we felt really comfortable!The hotel is in a great central location - right in the heart of urban Sydney full of funky coffee shops, bars, restaurants and 'interesting' people. We were made to feel so welcome by the friendly and helpful staff who allowed us to come back at all times of night/morning aswell as eat our body weight in peanut butter toast each day.Our room was huge with simple minimalist furnishings and showers big enough to sit in.There are a fantastic selection of local papers to plan your party time or gossip mags to read on the phenomenal terrace. We would definately stay again and recommend it to others.

<Content>Perfectly Located We stayed at the Altamont for two weeks and would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel for its excellent location, great value for money and a very warm no-fuss relaxed atmosphere.Continental breakfast is on offer but if you want something more substantial take a walk outside and you will be surrounded by a vast range of caf茅's and restaurants all offering delicious food from various nationalities and at prices that won鈥檛 break the bank.There is no need to hire a car if you stay at the Altamont, all of Sydney's popular tourist sights are within walking distance but if you want to use public transport there is a very efficient bus service with travel ten tickets available from local newsagents. If you prefer to use a taxi there is an abundance of them right outside the hotel to wave down. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Altamont and would like to thank Alan and staff for the excellent service they provided. Helen  Ray George, London, England.

<Content>Sleep in heaven I recently stayed at the Altamont for four days and was amazed I slept in every day, not something I have ever been able to do. The room was spacious and sooo quiet. I found the Motel to be very welcoming and homely in it's feel, and the decor was classy without being overbearing or fussy. Everything was in walking distance which was great as I took in all the sites with the minimum of time wasted on travel. What made the stay great for me though was definately the easygoing atmoshpere and the attitude of the staff. A lot of places I have stayed I am made to feel like a guest, which is ok but at the Altamont I felt like a return visitor, at home. When you are in a strange place that can be a nice thing to come back to after a day trawlng the sites.Deb

<Content>This place has something special Having an interest in architecture and design, I have always been fascinated by how an environment can influence your mood and outlook. And this place has it! It gives you this feeling of optimism and energy that sets you up for the day. And after a day of activity you look forward to coming back. Guests actually greet eachother warmly and with an expectancy it could lead to something more. The staff reflect the atmosphere, or perhaps help create it. They are genuinely nice and helpful, and have a keen sense of humour! I saw one family from Canada hug Alan as they were leaving, invited him to stay and gave him their numbers back home. I definitely recommend staying here,   Simon Oates

<Content>Loved the Altamont The Altamont is a cosmopolitan retreat in the coolest area of Sydney. My partner and I both love the atmosphere in Darlinghurst - it has a really laid back vibe that's important while you are on holiday. The Altamont only added to our love of Sydney - it has a real cosy and individual feel that only a boutique hotel could provide. The rooms are large and tastefully decorated, our bathroom was bigger than my bedroom at home! Alan (the manager) made us feel really welcome and gave us lots of hints and tips that made our stay in Sydney the best yet. We will defiantly be returning and would recommend it to anyone.P.S The view from the roof terrace is amazing, make sure you take a trip up there!

<Content>A luxury room for a budget price I stayed at the Altamont with my girlfriend early March 2007, and was very impressed by the experience.The room we were given genuinely was of luxury hotel quality: high ceilings, huge comfy bed, and big ensuite, and all for only AUS$ 110 per night. Great location too: close enough to the colour of Kings Cross and to the CBD, without being bang in the middle of it.I would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Sydney.

They truly made our visit unforgettable. Alan, who we mostly dealt with, gave us wonderful restaurant recommendations that were where the locals dine. We were not disappointed.My room was nicely appointed and comfortable. It was a great value. I would highly recommend this hotel to my friends.Staying at the Altamont is one of the reasons that my vacation in Sydney was so wonderful.

<Content>A great hotel The staff are excellent, cheerful, enjoy there job and well adverse to providing customer service at it's best. The hotel is well worth it for it's price per night and was one of the best we stayed in during our 3 week stay in Australia. The hotel is unique, clean , tidy, large rooms and altogether a great hotel. It is close to Kings cross train station but far enough away from Kings cross to be quiet and tranquil. The Darlinghurst area is great if you like cafe's deli's and social drinking and it's on your doorstep. If you want rowdy, Kings cross 4 mins walk away has that too. All in all definetly a hotel we would come back to.

<Content>Great place to stay! This hotel is a great choice when staying in Sydney. It's right in the middle of Darlinghurst, a hip part of the city, with great restaurants, cafes and boutiques all within walking distance, and a major train station two bocks away. It took us about 45 mins to walk to the Opera House. The decor is modern with Indonesian touches. Plus you get a complimentary continental breakfast and free wi-fi (my other friend's hotel charged him $24/day for wireless!)Hotel managers Alan and his partner always greeted us warmly as we came and went. We would definitely consider staying there again should we return.

<Content>Funky place in the heart of a great neighborhood The Altamont has the perfect location to enjoy Darlinghurst and get a taste of King's Cross and interesting and modern ambience to make the stay comfortable. I enjoyed not only dining around the neighborhood, but access to the CBD, Domain and other parks wasn't far for walks or jogs. And the staff was very helpful with everything, from calling cabs to serving cocktails. I look forward to another stay there.

<Content>A very nice time at The Altamont My husband and I wanted to try a different hotel on our last foray into the bright lights of Sydney, we searched the web and found the Altamont.I was unsure of what to expect so when we arrived we were thrilled. The price was great! The room was spotless and we loved the huge bathroom.We are in our fifties but 'young at heart'. So we found the area just fab. The street over was full of neat little eating houses, so important on ones holiday. We also discovered the walk into the CBD very managable from the hotel, and very good access to public transport when the old feet got tired. I would happily tell anyone to go enjoy the Altamont and have no fears about the so important good nights sleep. Slept like a pair of babes,very quiet in our room. We also enjoyed the friendly staff who were all most helpful if we asked a question about the city. To tell the truth I for one would go back tomorrow. Its a fine little place.

<Content>The Altamont .Recommended for central Sydney This place has a wonderful atmosphere. It is in a great location and I think it offered great value.The rooms are clean and comfortable and all have character. It is ideally situated a minute from excellent cafes and restaurants(where in Sydney isn't?)and is so easy to travel out from ,but above all that the attitude and friendliness won us over. The altamont has a really nice happy feel about it which was not expected in such a central location.A big big thanks to Alan and the team from us and the ginger kid x x x

<Content>No worries here Date: Jan 19thReviewer: Christina  UddyWhat a gem in Darlinghurst. We were only planning to stay 2 nights and extended it to 5. Allan and Sam were so helpful with terrific restaurant recommendations and self-guided walking tours. The area is the perfect point of departure to explore Sydney's best sights and funky stores and cafes. The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated. Wonderful free wireless connection....breakfast may not be worth jumping out of bed for; but, with all the wonderful restaurants and bakeries within a one-minute walk, who cares.

<Content>Simple aesthetic close to trendy coffee shops This is the second year I've stayed for my 3 week visit to Sydney and yet again I felt comfortable  happy to be there. The rooms have a simple aesthetic with everyting you need and his year I had a delightful little courtyard. The staff are very helpful, particulalry Alan who was often on the front desk - his dogs are a delight - Mother  Daughter! I had to change rooms during my stay as I had a brief visit to the Sunshine Coast  on my return in my new room was a vintage bottle of red - a small gift for returning - a nice touch!If I'm lucky to visit Sydney again next year I am sure I shall be staying at the Altamont!John,PS: Try to get a courtyard room if you can and if not don't worry - still worth it!

<Content>Friendly, funky  What a great, unpretentious place in a fantastic location! The room was nice, the staff was friendly  we loved the resident dogs. You can't beat the location - we walked to the harbor every day  enjoyed the great restaurants around Kings Cross  Darlinghurst every night. Super value.

<Content>Altamont Hotel: Very handy location, friendly and very helpful service The staff made ourstay at The Altamont Hotel a very friendly and enjoyable experience. The room we had was very clean, well serviced and had plenty of storage space for clothes. The bathroom was spacious, extremely clean and well looked after.The Altamont Hotel is very well located. Within a short walk can be found the lovely and peaceful Rushcutters Bay, and yet is very close to some very good bars and restaurants. Our 10-day stay was a very pleasurable one. Alan and his team made all visitors feel very welcome and were always happy to provide well-informed and friendly advice about making the most of the local facilities and attractions.The Altamont was pretty much ideal for our stay and I would be very happy to stay there again.

<Content>Altamont - My Home in Sydney! The Altamont had a great location and great staff, and a pool table, and a little bar, and a rooftop deck - with easy access to bars, restaurants and public transportation. The staff were more than gracious with ready recommendations for all of our inquiries. It's where I'll be staying on my next trip to Sydney.

<Content>relaxing, yet cool home from home A delightful find, where we were made to feel truly individual house guests. Nothing was too much trouble. We arrived at 930am from london, to find a gorgeous room waiting. The lobby feels like a funky club, with Indonesian furniture, and leather arnchairs. Instant wireless.Also a great area for cafes and restaurants, as well as being only a 30 mins walk to downtown. We lost track of all the diversity of cuisine avaiable within a 15 min stroll from the hotel.Only small difficulty was parking, but we soon figured out where best to go. The carwash opposite will always do a deal.Cant wait to return- such nice people.Karen and Bob ( London)

<Content>Loved the Altamont We stayed for 3 days in mid Nov 06 and loved it! The location was even better than we expected, many wonderful shops and restaurants  cafes w/in a very short walk, and it was not on a major busy street. We found the hotel to be very clean, nice  quiet, and the room to be very comfortable. The description of the hotel as a luxury backpacker accommodation was quite apt. Before arriving we were somewhat worried by a couple of earlier reviews (certainly not the majority opinion), but our experience was definitely a reflection of all the very positive reviews that we'd read beforehand. Ian and Allan were delightful, and it was a joy to stay with them. In retrospect, I can't imagine where those negative reviewers were coming from -- did they expect the Shangri-La? If so, they certainly didn't pay for it at the Altamont. I did, later on in our stay, and while the S-L was wonderful, dollar-for-dollar the Altamont was the best value I've gotten in a very long time! We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic location  I live in London and have stayed at the Altamont on 3 separate occasions (Dec 05, June 06, Dec 06), twice whilst holidaying with my girlfriend and once when doing business in Australia. An excellent yet relatively quiet location in Darlinghurst means that numerous bars and restaurants are on your doorstep; the CBD can be reached on foot in 20 minutes, by taxi in 5-10 minutes or by train (from Kings Cross station) in 15 minutes. Bondi Junction's shops and connecting buses to Bondi Beach are also only 15 minutes away by train.The size of the Altamont (relative to a chain hotel) means that you receive a genuinely friendly welcome and individual service, spacious and airy rooms, combined with the practical benefits of a larger establishment (daily room cleaning, individual fridge  tea/coffee facilities, shared iron, spare towels etc) - all at an unbeatable price!We recommend this hotel to anyone from Sydney newcomers to regulars and we certainly consider the Altamont to be our Sydney 'home'.

<Content>Hotel Altamont in Sydney Hotel Altamont, Darlinghurst Road, SydneyWe had a very bad experience with this hotel. Even if we booked and payd a lot of nights in this hotel the manager behaved with us very rude and illoyal. So he promised to put us on the waiting list for the 31th of December and 1st of January and if he gets a cancellation, we get this room for sure...He got a cancellation but he gave the room to the first two guys entering the hotel... By coincidence we were recognising it at this time but it was to late already.Even if the Hotel is not too bad, this illoyal, rude and stupid behavior to good-paying guests is not excusable and gives a very bad light on Sydneys Tourism Industry - so stay away from this Hotel - there are much better places anyway!

<Content>Best value in town Having just returned from a weekend in Sydney I can genuinely say that the Altamont is the best value for money hotel around. I have sampled various different types and locations of accomodation in Sydney and nothing beats it for price, style, proximity to everything and friendly service. The location, Darlinghurst, is an interesting part of Sydney with an ecclectic mix of locals and tourists, minutes to the main shopping hub of Oxford street and walking distance to the city, Opera house etc. The rooms are functional but funky  styley with great furniture and individual touches. Friendly laidback atmosphere and staff. I will definitley return and would recommend it to anyone who would rather spend their hard earned cash on shopping and good times, rather than an over-priced, characterless 5-star hotel.

<Content>Best value, position and service in Sydney! After numerous stays in Sydney, we found the Altamont-What a blessing! The Altamont is positioned in chic Darlinghurst Rd, right in the thick of things. Only steps to Kings Cross and Oxford Street shopping, the area is abundant with cafes, bars and boutiques. The hotel offers great accommodation that leaves enough money in your wallet to enjoy the area. The rooms are very large for Sydney standards and the breakfast is a great way to start your day. Excellent service and accommodation means that you will visit the Altamont again and again!

<Content>Loved the Altamont We stayed at the Altamont Easter weekend and had a brilliant stay. The hotel itself was lovely and the rooms were great, a welcome change to roughing it as we were on a budget. We stayed in a deluxe room which was great value and not much more than most Sydney hostels. The staff, Alan and Liam , were extremely friendly and helpful and were very accommodating to us.We would definitely recommend the hotal to others and would love to go back there some time ourselves.

<Content>My Sydney "Home 脧've just turned 66 and two years ago I travelled the United Kingdm and Europe for 69 days, staying at a different hotel each or every second night. Since my return I twice stayed at the Altamont Hotel, once with one friend, the second time with two friends. Nothing in my travels compares to the friendly relaxed atmosphere and environment of the boutique style Altamont. It's location in Darlinghurst Street, Kings Cross, makes an ideal base for any tourist activity. Although there is no restaurant in the Hotel, this is unnecessary due to the large number and variety available nearby. One of the great features of the Altamont is the character and prices of the various rooms on offer (some with a private courtyard). A unique feature of the Altamont includes a roof-top garden space for retreat.  How great to have the opportunity for relaxing interaction with a wide variety of guests in the front area - at community breakfast, the bar, snooker table and lounges. The staff are charming and welcoming, providing a wealth of information and assistance. Whenever I'm in Sydney I'll always be booked in my favourite holiday home at the Altamont where I know like-minded guests will abide.

<Content>Home Away From Home June 2006Loved the Altamont - it certainly proved to be 'home away from home' for me. Not being a business traveller but an ordinary citizen on holiday it was just the sort of place I could appreciate. No airs and graces from staff but sincere friendliness, courtesy and respect for myself and fellow travellers was obvious at all times. The hotel itself had wonderful ambience as far as I'm concerned. Room with a courtyard was pleasant surprise, furnishings individual and personally I found all very satisfactory. Enjoyed the location as it provided easy access to the city itself or the little park down the street - like I stated, 'home away from home'. As I'm not a particularly avid fan of television programmes, perhaps the only thing I could have accessed within the suite was a dvd player. This would have provided the means for a few hours quiet viewing of hired/own movies, this after a hectic day/night of doing the tourist thing! Nevertheless, light breakfast was adequate and the bar facilities were within easy access. Surrounding eateries provided the more substantial food requirements. It was quite enjoyable to relax with my favourite alcoholic indulgence whilst watching the world go by outside. I would not consider any other establishment on future travel to Sydney. Can't wait to get back there. It's got my vote!

<Content>Home from home We booked 1 week at the Altamont, having read a good review in the Lonely Planet. We were not disappointed. The manager Alan and the younger guy Liam, were so friendly and helpful. It was the little touches that we appreciated so much - we went to Hunter Valley for one night and left our large bags at the hotel. When we returned the next day, they were waiting for us in our new room. When we asked about day trips, we got back to our room in the evening and had a hand written note waiting for us with useful advice. You wouldn't get that kind of service in a large hotel.They spent lots of time talking to us which really made us feel at home, and feel welcomed. To top it all off, there are two gorgeous, well behaved dogs that come in with the owner now and then. They are such sweet natured dogs and we loved having them around to stroke and play with.The hotel itself is immaculately clean, tastefully decorated, the beds are incredibly comfy and huge and the rooms which have courtyards are really bright and cheerful. The location is great, near lots of lovely restaurants and bars. We liked the place so much that we came back for our final night before flying back to the UK. We had such a warm welcome back. I will recommend this place to anyone and hope that we can come back soon.

<Content>Deceiving! I satyed at the Altamont for seven nights. I thought that this would be a good choice! The website explained that this was a boutique, luxury budget hotel! Well yes it is a boutique hotel, i.e. it's small, and yes it is budget (Aus$108 p/night - 拢48 p/night), but it is not luxury!I have stayed at boutique hotels before and they pride themselves on their intimacy and comforts within your room, but the Altamont had no comforts. A hotel that wants to atrract a fashionable young crowd must surely think that a full length mirror in all bedrooms is a must. My room had no mirror and the bathroom was badly designed. Problems were bad lighting, no fan to let out steam which created wet floors and walls. You could not open the bedroom door in fear that you would let the fire alarms off (warnings were placed inside and outside the bathroom).The room was furnished nicely but was hampered by dirty walls and a dirty carpet! They need to repaint urgently and buy some new rugs! Only one of my bedside lamps was working and to finish this so called boutique, luxury yet budget look were two faded prints of Paris and some pier???The communal areas looked incomplete it seemed they had junk piling up in corners which just cluttered the place!Breakfast was a minimal affair of the most unimaginative cereal and bread, which you could toast. Maybe some fruit would be nice!I arrived late at night so had to check in via their sister hotel the Kirkton. The following morning I went to breakfast and saw who I beleive to be the manager/owner did not even acknowledge me, something that most boutique hotels pride themselves on 'the personal touch'. Only on my final day when I was checking out did I have any kind of conversation with the staff, but by then I was just desperate to find out a little about the staff. The guy who cleans the rooms was very sweet and always said hello and good morning. There was also a younger guy on reception who I would see upon my return in the evening who was very nice and always acknowledged me!This is not a bad hotel but it is not boutique and not luxury. The foundations are in place for a hotel that could work really well but they just need to fine tune a few things and it could quite happily be a nice luxury boutique budget hotel.

<Content>Altamont is only suitable for those who enjoy living Quintessential, quirky are just some of the words I would use on Altamont. Gza Gza Gabor once said, He taught me housekeeping and after the divorce i kept the house. All I could say now is I wished I was married to the owners of Altamont. And transformed the loft to my personal suite and the rest my moods rooms. The decor puns with life. Life is a laugh and the hotel team enspouses this too. They don't take life too seriously yet totally devoted to another level of care and hospitality service. If you are looking for a generic service void of personality, this is not the place for you!I have lived all my life out of a suitcase and Altamont alters the word hospitality. Shakespeare would not survive with his life is a big stage theoreom because life at Altamont is real and fun.Would I stay there again? Yes, the dogs loved me. They are simply the most loving furkids I have seen. And I hope they would be the ones who alert the owners I am going to visit, a place 5000 miles from anywhere.Unlike the Memoirs of a Geisha, this review is non-fictional.

<Content>Loved the Altamont The last time I was in Sydney I stayed at the Altamont Hotel Darlinghurst with two of my friends and we had the best time ever. The staff at the Altamont went out of their way to be friendly and helpful answering our questions and giving us any information we needed. I loved the courtyard room we stayed in, I thought it was well designed and decorated with all the mod cons and the bed extremely comfortable. I can recommend anyone thinking of holidaying in Sydney to stay at the Altamont and an added bonus was the friendly dog who was amazing to watch as she was so well trained.

<Content>What a great place! Read up on the Altamont in my 'Lonely Planet' guide and decided to spend my ten days in the city there; am so glad I did. This place is what they refer to as a 'boutique' hotel and so is not on the same scale as a 'regular' hotel; it's a lot more homely than that. It has a great feel about it and the rooms were stylish and clean. The front lobby has big comfy leather sofas, a pool table and a residents bar... a really cosy feel. I didn't know Sydney at all and so I found the guy on the front desk to be especially helpful whenever I had questions about walks I wanted to check out, a cool place to have lunch nearby or advice on something or other... all of his recommendations were 'winners'!Thoroughly recommendable and will definitely be going back toward the end of the year. Check them out.

<Content>I Would Stay At The Kirketon Next Time.... I stayed here during the end of September/start of October 2005. I have never been backpacking before and this is probably as close as I will ever come to it (I hope). The hotel it self is fine. If you're after basic accomodation, then this place is for you. Rooms are clean, minimal and functional - I had a ground floor room and no problem with noise. The location is great. However, if you like Waitrose (nice supermarket in England for those of you outside the UK) as opposed to Kwik-Save (cheap place-think K Mart), then this place probably won't be to your liking...it lacks a certain kind of finesse that one would like to expect from an establishment that bills it self as a hotel rather than being one of those places that has an 's' before the 't' (hostel). The front desk area looked more like someone's home office, I wasn't sure if there was breakfast available - though I do recall seeing a loaf of bread near the front desk - toast anyone? My room was not very well lit, perfect for those moments when you feel like getting dressed in the dark. The concrete floor may have been daring interior design when the ho[s]tel opened, but now reminded me of a local authority car park I was sick outside aged six. None of these things ruined my stay because I didn't go to a fun city like Sydney to spend time inside my hotel room, however, I would probably stay at the Kirketon next time.
