<Content>Not the best ;0( Stayed here on business as the rate seemed quite good. Not sure if I was unlucky with my room (as it was an internal room), but I found it quite dingy, musty and a little pokey. The bathroom was fully equipped but left a little to be desired - the daily fight with the shower curtain for one! It is also quite noisy as the corridors seem to echo when people move about. (Recommend ear plugs!). Pool looked nice, but I arrived too late in the eve to use it. Free entrance to the Egyptian museum for guests too, which I used. (Not much there, but something to do if you have an hour to kill!) . Overall, not my first choice of hotel, but If you can get a good price though, I would consider it again overall.

<Content>great hotel, perfect location most importantly, the location is spot on- around 15 minutes walk down to Placa de Catalunya. if you enjoy shopping, you are only five minutes away from the main shopping street Passeig de Gracia. Everything was easy to get to- especially Gaudi buildings (la Pedrera)pool was great for a dip after a long day of sightseeing- rooms were very very clean- we even had a small terrace with chairs and a tablemy friend and i don't speak spanish- the hotel staff that we dealt with spoke good enough english for this not to be a problem- however some of the staff could have been more friendly- e.g. saying hola when we went out or returned in the evening.overall, i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to make the most out of their trip to barcelona

<Content>Good hotel with a nice location We stayed at the Balmes for 3 nights, two of us in a quiet room facing the pool and the other two in a room facing the street. The rooms are very clean and comfortable, the location is excellent - and we found the staff to be very nice and friendly (we do not speak spanish). The hotel has a carpark, which is nice if you come by car. We paid Eur 225 per room for Thursday night and Eur 138 Friday and Saturday night. We booked through the hotel's website.We will recommend the hotel to familiy ans friends.

<Content>Nice hotel - grumpy staff I will start by saying the hotel is fine. We took advice from this site and booked rooms facing the courtyard (paid 20 Euros extra per night per room) and it was incredibly quiet. We liked the hotel's location and access to dining spots. The small pool was very pleasant.The staff was very grumpy and did nothing to make us feel welcomed. Personally, I think all but one of the staff we met should be fired. There should be a reason that hotels are considered to be part of the hospitality industry. I think if I checked in again I would immediately make it known that I was not going to tolerate the unpleasantness of the staff. Additionally we wanted to change something on our reservation. This was impossible to do via email or phone calls we made before we left the United Sates. We wound up keeping the reservation as we originally booked but we did feel scammed.All this being said, I still would stay there again. We found the rooms to be perfectly cleaned and maintained.One final tip, we wandered over to the Passeig Gr脿cia a beautiful boulevard about three blocks from the hotel. We had a quick breakfast of coffee and pastries at a cafe .... it turned out to be a $75 breakfast for four of us. My guess is this is just emblematic of the priciness of this particularly elegant thoroughfare - cafes off on side streets charged a fraction of this cost.

<Content>No double rooms on standard rates Having booked a double room through expedia we were then told on arrival that in order to get a double we needed to pay a supplement but that it would be very quiet, until they knocked down a wall outside our window at 8am. Following my complaint about that the staff were grumpy and rude. I would not recomend this hotel.

<Content>Stained sheets, rude manager The hotel was in a good location, but there were several issues that ruined the experience for me. First of all, if you are not fluent in Spanish, this is NOT the hotel for you. The staff seemed very annoyed to have to speak English with us. I understand that we're in their country, so why should they have to speak our language? But it is a hotel, it happens. Every hotel guest we encountered was British (and spoke English with the staff), so this isn't an uncommon occurence for them.Secondly, my bedsheets and pillowcases were covered in brown stains. It was quite gross. And last but not least...the airline lost our luggage, and our cell phones did not work overseas. The manager seemed very annoyed that we gave the airlines the hotel's phone number as our contact number. When we asked simple questions about the airport, we were given short, gruff answers that were far from helpful. Where is the service here? it wasn't a cheap hotel, they could at least pretend to be understanding of our situation.Needless to say, I will never stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Very Reasonable Hotel Balmes was one of four places we stayed during our recent visit to Spain and it was also one of the best values. The downtown location is near Casa Mila, Casa Batllo and the Gracia Metro station. We very much appreciated the free WiFi. But there were some issues: 1. The heat/AC seemed to furnish only heat, with no thermostat, and when we threw open the window to relieve the stuffiness, there was a constantly noisy street scene outside. 2. There was a loud dripping noise at times on the ceiling of the bathroom, 3. The bath/shower is designed in such a way that the bath spout protrudes into the center of the tub, making it an easy target for your knee when showering, 4. The room was a bit on the shabby side and in need of some minimal decoration, such as pictures on the walls, 5. Some of the desk staff seemed a bit arrogant and unaccommodating. My wife stayed at the Balmes three years ago and had a better experience. We might stay here again if subsequent reviews on TripAdvisor indicate that the problems have been resolved.

<Content>Cheap but Noisy Stayed here for three nights Nov 07 as part of a group of 12 friends. We chose it mainly because of its nearness to Las Ramblas.Overall, we were fairly happy with this hotel, but we each had individual gripes as we were scattered throughout the hotel and had differing experiences. All agreed that the noise factor was an issue. ALL the rooms have paper-thin walls it seems and you can hear people speaking in the next room - goodness knows what it would be like if they were rowing!! Also the lack of carpeting means that you hear every footstep, both in the rooms and in the corridors. One couple had a room next to the lifts and heard everyone getting in and out all night. Two couples had rooms that were overlooked by the pool area which meant they had to keep their blinds closed at all times. We had a front facing room which I have to say was only noisy if you left the windows open, but the hair-dryer was broken - reported to reception the first hour we were there- but never repaired. One couple's safe was broken - when reported were told that it had been like that for a while!!!All agreed the reception staff were polite but not particularly helpful or interested. We didn't have breakfast because it seemed expensive when we booked. Lots of cafes nearby offer more choice and better value. The free internet was a plus and the chambermaid was a gem - we could not fault the cleanliness. Overall - great location, clean rooms, noise factor and desk-staff attitude let it down.

<Content>Very noisy hotel If you value peace and quiet don't stay here. The rooms are nice, the staff are fine but this place is noisy: no carpet in the halls so you hear everyone else walking through at all hours; no carpet in the rooms so all noise reverberates. The staff are OK although not as helpful as I have experienced at other hotels in Spain. Avoid the breakfast at this hotel - lthere are ots of options within a few blocks. This hotel has a great location but there are others nearby that I would try first. I won't be staying here again.

<Content>Okay for business and leisure The decor of the hotel is quite nice with brick walls in the rooms that end up looking quite stylish. The rooms are sparse and the single bed's very narrow, but also comfortable. The double room was spacious. The toilet is also spacious and has enough space for a few people's toiletries.There is free wifi, you have to ask for the code from the reception. Signal in my room was okay.There is a very small outdoor pool at the hotel, but I didnt get to try it. There is breakfast available for 13 euros, but it's very basic. Any warm food, and there's only three choices (some chorizo and eggs) and none of them were good, so you are better of eating somewhere in the neighborhood. There's tons of little cafe's and restaurants in the area.The hotel area is excellent and it's only about a 8 minute walk to Ramblas and the downtown area. Just far enough that you'll have some peace and quiet at the hotel.

<Content>Paper Thin Walls - Not good if you value sleep Just returned from Barcelona - cold but amazing place, buildings, shops and food excellent. Our travel agent suggested Hotel Balmes as we could not get availability in Gravina. We looked at reviews on Trip Advisor and they seemed Ok for went for it.This is 3 star and there are good and very bad points depending on your priorities.Our first experience was not the best as we advanced booked a double non-smoking room. When we checked they tried to sell us an upgrade to an executive room for an extra E20 per night, but we did not feel it was necessary. When were taken up to the room it was a twin and stank, I mean stank of smoke. They did not inform us of this when we checked in, but told me when I went to check - they told me were fully booked, no apology - even though they had already offered an alternative executive room!, which as this was their mistake seemed poor and their attitude was totally indifferent. So we slept in it and thank god were moved the next day (or at least we though it would be better).GOOD POINTS- Breakfast great, times good and lots of choice and nice waitresses.- Location excellent for exploring sights, metro, nice shops and restaurants. - Hotel spotless.- Free internet access if you can get on it as only 1 PC.BAD POINTS- The walls are paper thin 鈥?we could hear every cough and movement in all the surrounding rooms of which there seemed to be many at every corner of the hotel. We had our fair share of noise some well into and in the middle of the early hours but I dread to think if you got someone who snored next door - then God help you! We thought it was just a one off the 1st night in the smoke room but the noise problem was inherent in the hotel structure as there are clearly no cavities between the rooms. If you are a person who likes sleep 鈥?you should AVOID this hotel.- Reception staff could not care less, they did not even say hello when we went in and out of the hotel, it was clear they were not happy in their work!Having said apart from the fact we were quite tired as did not get great sleep Barcelona is fantastic and Hotel Omm is a must for a relaxing drink after dinner.

<Content>Balmes - Location, Location, Location Hotel was wonderful value for money. Rooms were very clean, comfortable and serviced meticulously each day. Excellent choice at breakfast with a selection of hot dishes offered every second day. Free internet facility in the hotel foyer area and a free safe facility in each bedroom. Two metro stations within easy walking distance - buy a 10-journey ticket at the easy to use vending machines within the metro stations. Ten-minute walk to the top of La Rambla. Agree with previous reviewer about the high quality tapas bar just round the corner. Would also recommend El Glop on the Rambla Catalunya - about 6-minute walk from hotel.Have stayed in a number of hotels in Barcelona - the Balmes ranks among the best.

<Content>Good location Friendly hotel with English speaking reception who were very helpful, gave us a map and free entrance to exhibition on arrival. We had a duplex with 2 flat screened TVs - one in the bedroom and one in sitting area. Everything spotlessly clean. Quite quiet room as requested, as previous stay on the Ramblas meant a week of little or no sleep. ( only 20min walk to Las Ramblas though)We preferred this location as we were surrounded by good shops, bars and restaurants. You must go the the Cerveseria Catalana a little way down Carrer de Mallorca - absolutely fabulous tapas and buzzing atmosphere all day. We had breakfast there as we didn't want to pay 13 Euros in the hotel as we both only eat very little in the morning. However, the breakfast display looked impressive. We found the area in the evening great and it wasn't as touristy as further down towards The Ramblas. Close to Ramblas Catalunya and Passeig Garcia for mucho shopping interspersed with cafe and cakes.The Caio Bella cocktail Bar on the corner was good too, with friendly staff and free tapas.Altogether a very good trip and I would cerytainly recommend this Hotel and use it myself again.

<Content>Excellent value We stayed at this hotel for 6 days in August and September of 2007. We had to be in Barcelona and area for business and found the hotel ideally located.We stayed 1 night upon arrival and then had to stay in Tarragona for 1 night, followed by another 5 nights at the Balmes. We asked the staff for the same room upon our return from Tarragona and they were very helpful and gave us an identical room upon return. Very clean,modern and ideally located to everything Barcelona has to offer. Breakfast not included, but -if you sign up for the entire stay- the price is lowered to Euro 6.50 from the standard Euro13.Very nice breakfast buffet and the staff will prepare boiled/fried eggs if desired(as well as espresso or cappucino).Underground parking is somewhat tight, but staff will park car if you're not comfortable doing it yourself.Nice restaurants ( I suggest Tragaluz)in the area and shopping only moments away.Very good value and we will stay there again.

<Content>Above Average for a 3 Star! I disagree with some of the negative comments about this hotel. We found this hotel to be very well taken care of and the rooms to be beautifully clean with updated bathrooms and features. The staff was very helpful especially when we needed to find a local gym to exercize at while we were there. In addition, the pool is a great way to rest up in the sun after a long day of sightseeing to get you ready for a night out on the town! They even have free internet in the lobby. The only thing we found amusing was the sound of water in the walls anytime the rooms next to us flushed. We actually found that pretty relaxing as long as you didn't focus on the fact that it was a toilet. Overall, I'd recommend a stay here.

<Content>Above average for a 3* hotel!! We stayed at the Balmes for 3 nights in August 07. We booked an executive room, which was on the small side but was still very satisfactory. The great benefit of this room was that we had our own private terrace with sun loungers, as well as a table and chairs on the terrace. The hotel in general was very nice. I found the staff to be friendly and very helpful. Having the pool was definitely a plus, especially for the weather in August. The hotel's location is perfect, within walking distance of Ramblas, as well as some really nice shops! I wouldn't recommend the breakfast in the hotel, however - it's not worth it for the price and there are a lot of places nearby where you can get a cheaper but tastier meal!This is definitely above average for a 3star hotel and I would recommend it to others.

<Content>Well Located- Staff Indifferent We selected the hotel based on location- and in that sense it was perfect. The rooms were clean, comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. The hotel front desk staff however were totally rude and unhelpful. My friend lost his luggage and they were not even willing to make the call to the airport to help him find out the status.It was easy enough to find wonderful things to see and do in the area- but no thanks to the hotel staff.I would recommend it as a excellent place if you have a short time to see Barcelona and want to be in the center.

<Content>Very pleasant stay We stayed here for a week this Easter and found the hotel staff to be pleasant and helpful.We would not recommend the inside rooms as they are overheated and small. After our first night we transferred to a room at the back which was more spacious and had a lovely viewof the garden.The bathroom was well-appointed and a pleasure to use.We enjoyed the breakfast, but it is rather pricey. A better bet is the nearby Cervesseria Catalana. Just as good and a quarter the price.We would definitely use this hotel again.

<Content>Recommended - what is there to criticise? I don't know how anyone can knock this hotel. The public areas are smart and stylish, the rooms well equipped, very clean, nicely decorated (we had a lovely bathroom) and a comfortable size. There was also free internet access in the swish foyer! The staff pleasant, efficient and professional- all one should expect really: they are not there to be your friend!In terms of noise, we had had a room on a lower floor above the entrance and yes we could hear traffic when we had the window open but when it was shut, it was barely audible apart from the odd siren (quieter than my London flat anyway!). We were disturbed by another guest outside our room on her mobile but a hotel is not accountable for its guests and it is a hotel not a library after all. I would not describe it as noisy.The best bit though was definitely the breakfast - fantastic choice of food from the buffet such as cold meats, pastries, cereals etc (none of it rationed) as well as freshly cooked dishes (first time I have seen real bacon served by a continental hotel!). It is also served in a very nice conservatory style room.This hotel seems to have its detractors - I can only think they want a 5* hotel at 3* prices. This is definitely the best 3* hotel I have stayed in that I can think of. You can certainly do a lot worse for your money. Recommended!!

<Content>Would recommend Stayed here for a 4 day break. Lovely room, breakfast good, location great - nice and quiet and only a 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas. Located in business area off Avenue Diagonal. Fabulous restaurant nearby - green awning where all the locals eat. Easy walk to meet bus to go to airport. Would stay here again.

<Content>weekdays are fine I work in a three star hotel in Bournemouth and found this hotel excellent. Breakfast is expensive but excellent. The pool is a godsend before and after sightseeing, free internet, polite staff and clean well serviced rooms. The area is safe after dark with good restaurants nearby. We stayed weekdays so no noise for our groundfloor rooms and no hen parties - just normal multi- national guests.

<Content>Must do better Disappointing. We had stayed at another Derby hotel in Barcelona, the Astoria, and were well impressed. We decided to head for its sister hotel, the Balmes mainly because of its more central position -and what you cannot fault is that. Near enough but not in the middle of everything - a 5 min walk from placa catalunia, just right. Its just not in the same class as the Astoria.The rooms small but functional.The welcome was not unfriendly, but not friendly - decidedly neutral. In fact, that kind of sums up the Hotel - didn't give much an impression of anything to be honest, just neutral bland and dull. They were ripping out a lift without apology when we were there, which created quite a bit of noise and dust, which didn't much help the ambience. There was quite a bit of street noise, but I actually though it added to the atmosphere.The windows shut most of it out.They need to up their act, there are too many better hotels to be had. Didn't find it offensive in any way, but wouldn't rush back.Didn't eat there - too many eateries to explore.

<Content>Noisy and incredibly bad customer service It is without a doubt the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in. It is impossible to sleep. The staff are incredibly rude and unhelpful. One day I was served a toasted sandwich that was covered in mould! I do not recommend this hotel to anyone - stay clear.

<Content>Honest review of Balmes! I have just returned from the Balmes Hotel, I chose the hotel for the venue for my hen weekend. The Balmes is a good location, I have stayed on Las Ramblas before and the noise was awful. The hotel is set in a quiet street and easily accessible from the shopping district. A 10 min ride in a taxi will take you to the port and the beach and the Metro station is a 5 min walk. The hotel has a great pool and I would highly recommend you book a hotel with a pool - Barcelona gets very hot and it is perfect for relaxing. The rooms are small - but considering you are in beautiful Barcelona you should spend as little time as possible in your room!! I would say that the weekend staff do not cater for larger groups, the waiter appeared to be taking orders and cooking and serving the food. The staff seemed to discriminate larger groups who take advantage of the fabulous nightlife.... we were not a tacky hen party but we were treated like we were!! The week staff are great - so please do not expect first class service. at the weekend The Balmes is a great place for couples and smaller groups, I would def return with my future husband - great value and good facilities - just be prepared for cold behaviour from the staff if you enjoy a couple of drinks and a little bit of a party!!

<Content>Mediocre at best Just returned from an 11 day trip through Spain with the beautiful city of Barcelona being our first stop. Although we were pleased with the location of the Hotel Balmes, that is about all we were pleased with. We checked in with a small child having requested a triple room and were given a very noisy room both next to the VERY noisy elevator and the front street construction. After some haggling, we were moved to a more quiet room in the back, but I still had to sleep with earplugs in to keep from being woken by the thin walls. The hotel pictures are somewhat deceiving based on the 2 rooms we saw. The rooms are very tired with the builder clearly having taken the cheap route on the modern rehab and it shows. The attached bar is often not open and despite saying it serves food, it seems to depend on how many guests they have. Free coffee service is only provided until 6:30 am and we found the front desk staff to be cold at best. I am certain that Barcelona has MUCH better hotels offerings that have equally as good of a location.

<Content>just noisy The staff very helpful and friendly. The hotel was very very clean but the style of the rooms were old and tired (80), however the bed was comfortable and the bathrooms were nice and crean. It takes 20 to 30 minutes walking to la Placa Cataluna. Very noisy if you are one of the front rooms cos of the thin glass big windows and because the main street but also noisy doors and you can hear other people and staff. I found balmes hotel expensive.

<Content>OK Location but noisy rooms Hotel Balmes looks very plush from outside and in the reception area, however we were in room 13 and it was very dark and also very noisy, didn't get too much sleep during our stay. Our room was spacious though and had a seating area as well as sleeping area and nice bathroom. The walk to Placa Catalunya was about 20 minutes I would say, which was further than I had originally thought, but it was easy to find our way around. Didn't have breakfasts at the hotel. Used the garden area, but not the pool although it did look very tempting, but the weather wasn't really warm enough.

<Content>Great location Hotel is in a great safe location in the Eixample area away from the hustle  bustle of the Ramblas, yet only 2 blocks west of the P de Gracia  walkable to the Ramblas. Heaps of great cafes  tapas bars close by. Metro station (Provenca) is a block away. Staff are friendly. Rooms are clean but simple. Didn't use the pool or have breakfast in the hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel, good location We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in September. Hotel was very clean and in a great neighborhood. It is a little ways from the Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas, but not too bad (~15 min walk). Right down the street from Pg de Gracia metro stop, which has commuter trains to the airport, and to many of the smaller towns outside of Barcelona. We were on the 5th floor, so our room was very quiet, even during the day. Only complaint is they charged 40 euros for an extra bed in our double room.

<Content>How could you not be happy here ? We have just come back from 6 days in room 520. Ok, so the rooms are hardly suite size, but they're hardly small either. All I can imagine is that the less satisfied reviewers on here are used to staying in 5* suites. My top 10 points about the hotel:1) Fab location 30 minutes gentle ramble from the Ramblas/Port Vell; well situated for the Passeig de Gracia (for glam desginer window shopping) and the Rambla de Catalunya (Ciudad Central having the best tapas in town). 2) Nice bathrooms with GREAT water pressure and foot-washing basins. 3) V expensive mini-bars can be emptied and refilled with your personal supermarket buys.4) Nice little pool ideal for cooling off with sunloungers and towels5) Decent brekkie spread with sausages, cured meats, bread, cereals, pastries and fresh fruits. 6) Free early morning tea and coffee (but only till 0730) 7) Huge beds - over king sized which are very comfy. 8) Safe for your valuables (which you don't have to pay extra for)9) Nice sized room with pleasant view over the gardens, little dining/lounge area10) Interesting egyptian artifacts all over the hotelAll in all a very pleasant experience, with none of the niggles mentioned in the previous reviews.

<Content>Great hotel, price and location The hotel was right in the center of everything you needed and only two blocks away from the Bus Turistic stop and the Gaudi Museum. Hotel room was big, bright and most of all clean. We had a huge king size bed which was extremely comfortable, in room safe, mini bar and large bathroom. Hotel staff were polite and helpful although many did not speak good English but hey you are in Spain afterall.Overall this hotel exceded my expectations and we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Good location, fair price We stayed at the Balmes for 3 nights. Nothing special, but fair for the price, especially if all of your first choice hotels are booked (ours were, but we booked late). The location in L'Eixample was terrific though, blocks from Casa Batllo and other great sites and a nice area. For a great tapas bar, be sure to try Cerveseria Catalana, just a block over on Mallorca near the intersection of Rambla de Catalunya. (Even if you don't stay at the Balmes, try this restaurant - the food was fantastic and the atmosphere is lively!)

<Content>4 stars - what for? we had a little business trip to barcelona and took the Balmes hotel as it was recommended to us as a valuable 4 star hotel in good location.the single rooms we got were that tiny, that first we couldn麓t even find a place where to put our luggage. luckily the rooms were near the elevator, that had a problem and made some annoying noises throughout the night, so i couldn麓t sleep at all.i changed room and got one street-sided - so i wasn麓t disturbed by the elevator but the traffic noise. the breakfast was o.k.but i never would rate this hotel 4-stars -- i mean i slept in barcelona in 2-stars hotels that had better rooms.

<Content>The Balmes in winter We have just arrived back from a three night stay at the Balmes Hotel, Barcelona in January 2005. Overall we were pleased with the hotel - the reception was glossy and full of marble as you'd expect and the rooms were modern, well decorated and comfortable (nice wooden floors and leather sofa!). There was a fab window in our room that went from floor to ceiling and over looked the pool (we were on the third floor) so the room was light and airy in the daytime and there was a handy alcove in front of the widow where you could store your suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower was really powerful and there was plenty of hot water at all times. The mini bar was very reasonable (not cheap but cheaper than most mini bars i've come accross - 鈧? for a bottle of water/can of coke). There was a king sized bed and, whilst the room wasn't the largest in the world, it did not feel cramped in any way. The only downside to the room was that there wasn't an iron or trouser press - the hotel has an expensive laundry service instead - so take a travel iron with you!!We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as we felt it was a bit pricey and we prefered to experience a bit of Barclona cafe life instead. The bar was a bit small but the barmaid was lovely, very friendly and helpful - serving us at the sofas in the foyer as the bar was closing and helping us with our spanish phrases!Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Balmes and would recommend it to those who want a decent, modern, comfortable hotel in a good (although not fantastic as you have to get taxi's to the best nightspots) location at a reasonable price (鈧?5 per room per night) but if you want luxuary, go elsewhere and pay more!

<Content>Could do better Hotel Balmes, well they really could do better. Excellent location for shopping and the sights. The hotel was very noisy at night and early morning, so much so that the maid cleaning the room next door woke us up, at 7am.. The first day, the water was brown and we could freshen up after the flight, this was fixed by next morning. From the reviews it seems total pot luck with the rooms, ours was mediocre size etc for the money. View was non existent as the window was too high up. The walls were so thin that you could hear the people in the bathroom next door. After staying in other hotels in other cities, this one is in a great location, I would try others first..
