<Content>Remarkable hotel Needed to take a few days off and booked the Inn based on TripAdvisor reviews. What a great hotel! The staff is very professional and accomodating. Town car service available to and from the airport, immaculate rooms, spacious bathroom, great location. This is not a great hotel for the price, its a great hotel. Had a room facing the inner coutyard and there was no problem with noise. (Some rooms face onto First St. which is very noisy.) Location is excellent for anything in downtown Seattle.Went to attached restaurant Bacco for breakfast and Cafe Champagne for dinner. Both are excellent.

<Content>Awesome room and hotel My wife and I just got back from a stay at the Inn at the Market and we had an excellent time. I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday so I was hoping for a good room. We were given room 311 which was considered a partial water view. We had an amazing view of both the Market and the Sound. The room had plenty of space and the bed was very comfortable. We were able to check in early and we immediately headed out to go shopping. When we returned to the hotel, we found small cupcakes in the room to celebrate the birthday which was a nice surpise. The hotel staff was super nice being responsive to our needs even calling us by name upon arrival. We ordered room service breakfast from Bacco and were impressed with the food. Our only minor complaint was the noise from the room heater. It was a little noisy which woke my wife up a couple of times. All in all, it was a very good stay!

<Content>An Inn that Cares This was my first stay at The Inn at the Market. The Inn seems to feel a bit more cozy then the big Hotel chains. I was pleasantly surprised by little touches that show this Inn cares if you return. We where there near Christmas they had Apple cider and cookies to welcome visitors. The proximity to the Market is awesome. Usually when I visit Seattle I can't bother to go down to the market because the traffic deters me. But to wake up and walk across the street was fabulous! Thanks to David Watkins he really takes pride in making sure visitors enjoy there stay.

<Content>Perfect Choice We needed a place to stay in downtown Seattle for a few days, and having read the reviews on trip advisor, chose the Inn at the Market. It proved to be a great choice, the rooms are really well proportioned, with excellent views across the the mountains. The location could not be better, it is literally on top of Pike Place market, yet manages to shut out all the noise. To top off the experience, the staff are all extremely friendly and helpful, despite our best Mariah impressions. Only one negative to mention, the power outlet for the hairdryer is right by the sink, and looked a bit of a hazard.

<Content>LIke a home from home On paper, there are better hotels around, but the friendliness of the staff has made this my personal favorite for longer stays in Seattle. The view of the sea and the market from some of the balconies is terrific. The location is good but it's still quiet. I'm quite picky and I've never had any complaint about the staff or the room here. Ask for your favorite room numbers because the rooms are all a little different. That's it's charm. The lobby's kind of small, so I don't recommend it for meetings!

<Content>Perfect place to stay in Seattle Inn at the Market is the perfect place to stay if you're visiting Seattle. The location is the best in the city - at the Pike Place Market, which is so much fun! You can also walk to upscale shopping, the waterfront and aquarium, dozens of great restaurants, museums (including the must-see new Olympic Sculpture Park), and so much more.The staff was gracious and friendly. My room had an incredible view of the Market and the water. Be sure to visit the outdoor deck on the fifth floor - even if the weather doesn't cooperate, the views will impress. I slept very well in the comfy bed. I loved the daybed by the window, too - wish I had one at home!

<Content>What a weekend! My work keeps me away from home, so usually the last thing I want to do is travel on MY free time. But the opportunity to come up to Seattle for a romantic getaway was too good to resist. Friends had told me about the Inn at the Market (I had never stayed there on biz), so my wife and I booked a room. What a great decision. Every part of our stay was terrific. The hotel is right in the heart of the Pike Place Market, and our room overlooked the water. Everything was perfect, and we had an enjoyable weekend touring the city and the Market. We enjoyed a bottle of wine on the rooftop deck and watched a spectacular sunset on Saturday. No question about it -- we'll be back.

<Content>Great Hotel, Perfect Location My husband and I just returned from our first trip to Seattle and a wonderful four day stay at the Inn at the Market. The hotel was recommended by a friend and we couldn't have been more pleased.The hotel is well-maintained and very modern, but not stuffy. We had a lovely partial water view room - comfortable queen bed, small bay window with table and chairs, sofa, excellent armoire and closet storage, mini-bar with enough room to hold drinks, etc. we purchased elsewhere, and a large writing desk. The bathroom was modern yet warmly decorated. If there is one thing we could change, it would be to upgrade the TV channel selection. While it's true that you don't go on vacation to watch TV, it would have been nice to have entertaining television to watch a little before falling asleep and when we wanted to just relax and enjoy the room.The staff was very accommodating and friendly. Anything we asked for was taken care of with a smile, from making reservations for a tour of the Boeing plant (highly recommended, by the way) to printing out our boarding passes the night before we left.The location cannot be beat. The hotel is just steps from Pike's Market, and within walking distance to almost all of the major sights.One place not to be missed is the little french bakery, Le Panier. Exit the hotel on Stewart Street and turn left; cross at the corner and the bakery is on your right. (It faces the Market.)Zeek's Pizza on 5th  Denney is a great place to stop for lunch after seeing the Space Needle, which is only about a mile from the Inn.We can't wait to go back to Seattle and the Inn at the Market.

<Content>Yet Another Happy Customer My husband and I just returned from a four night stay at the Inn at The Market. We loved it! We checked into the hotel immediately after climbing 9000ft of Mt. Rainier, so we really appreciated just how comfortable the hotel was. The staff was always happy to answer questions, and helped us with directions to restaurants a number of times. The room was a partial water view room, and was quite spacious - queen bed, table and chair by window, sofa and table, desk and chair. The bathroom was very nice. One thing that truly impressed me was that I had to request extra towels only on the first night. After that, we had extra towels every day. Also, the hotel supplied us with everything we needed for an in-room picnic: plates, silverware, napkins, wine glasses, corkscrew. I highly recommend foraging in the market for provisions and eating either in your room or on the 5th floor deck. All in all, our stay was extremely relaxed and comfortable. The location is wonderful, near lots of good restaurants. Go to Serious Pie and Wild Ginger.

<Content>Perfect Location We booked a beautiful view room for early March 2008 for 4 days for our anniversary. Took a taxi from SEATAC. Nice and easy. Upon arrival to the hotel we found they upgraded us and provided us with chocolates and strawberries for our anniversary. Had a perfect view of the huge red Pike Market sign, the ferries and the water way along with all the landscape and surrounds. If you want to experience the market, water, ferry and shopping surroundings, this is the place for you. The outside roof top porch is a great place to take a couple drinks and watch the views. We got lucky as there was no rain during the 4 days. The room provided free umbrellas. I was sort of bummed being from Arizona and not a lot of rain, I personally was hoping for some. Bought fresh flowers at the market and the hotel provided a vase at no charge. Nice amentities, comfy bed and large tv in living room and a separate one in the bedroom. Completed the underground tour of the old city, pretty cool so don't miss it. Never took the ferry, but maybe next time. Just too much to do in 4 days around the general area. Lots of excellent places to eat and drink.

<Content>Fantastic ! Just arrived home from our trip to Seattle. We had a wonderful time at this hotel. We had reserved a partial water view room and were pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us to a 7th floor townhome suite with a dramatic panoramic view of Elliott Bay. Absolutely spectacular !We didn't touch our car for 3 days. Everything was close, and we also took advantage of the free bus line that stops at the end of the block.We ate breakfast at Baccos (next door) where the staff was very friendly. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this hotel !

<Content>Great location and patio I stayed at this hotel in October and got lucky with the weather. It was sunny for most of my stay. As a result, I was able to take advantage of the fifth floor terrace overlooking the bay. I loved this feature of the hotel.The hotel is located across the street from the Pike Place Market so it's ideal for tourists. The downtown business district is an easy 5 or 6 block walk. The Inn is a smaller hotel that has been well maintained but shows its age a bit. All staff that I encountered were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is well suited for both business travellers and leisure travellers, including families.I booked a water view room which was quite large with fantastic views. The small sitting area in front of the windows was very nice. The bathroom was also decent size. I agree with the others who have stated that the mattresses are a bit uncomfortable. My room was on the fourth floor. I would stay at this hotel again but I would request a room on a higher floor as I experienced some eye opening late night noise from the courtyard below.

<Content>Excellent location for Pike Place Market We stayed for three nights as part of our Silver Wedding Anniversary trip around the West Coast. The hotel had kindly left a card and chocolate covered strawberries in our room, which was a lovely gesture.The hotel is only a couple of minutes walk from Pike Place Market, one of the best markets I've ever seen and made me wish we had such quality markets in England.The hotel reception staff and the valet staff were very helpful and their welcome was very warm, which is unusual for large hotels.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Inn at the Market as a great place to stay.

<Content>Everything I hoped This place is in a great location, literally over the road from Pike Market and about a 5 minute walk to the centre of the city. We originally werent sure whether to stay in the city, but given the Inn turned out to be so close to the city and that the Pike Markets are so colorful, it was a great choice.We didnt feel unsafe at any stage and in fact the mafority of the stranger types appeared to mainly reside in the city itself.There are plenty of places to eat very close by, from quick snacks to nice restaurants, so again location was excellent. We had breakfast at a small French patiserie about 2 minutes away that served great coffee and fantastic pasteries at a reasonable price.We were also impressed with the hotel. Although it doesnt look much from the outside, its been decorated modern but refined and the room was great. We tend to try and get a room with a view and in this case stayed in a Parlour Suite. While expensive, the room didnt let us down with both the view and quality. We were very happy and comfortable.Didnt try the hotels restaurants, but they always seemed to show up on the best in Seattle lists.So overall we couldnt have been happier at the Inn at the Market and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>A Stay We Will Long Remember My husband and I just returned from the most memorable stay in Seattle....and it was not for the lovely city of Seattle, the fun we had at the Seahawks game, the delicious dinners, or the beautiful views of the bay from our hotel. We have stayed at the Inn At The Market before. All have been wonderful, however, this visit touched me in ways no other visit has. I am so very grateful to the staff at the Inn At The Market, but particularily to our room maid, Josie. When packing up to leave our lovely room, I placed my travel bag of jewelry on the bed. We went out for breakfast. Upon returning we packed our bags and checked out. Enroute home, 5 hours from the hotel, when I remembered my jewelry. I forgot to pack it, leaving it on the unmade bed. In the bag was my wedding ring, my diamond engagement ring, a diamond pendant, pearls, among others....precious pieces that I have had for our 32 years of marriage. I immediately called the hotel to report my loss. The maid had registered my jewelry bag, sealed it, and sent it to the front desk. It was there when I called. The front desk staff packaged it up and sent it UPS to me in Canada. I received it, all intact, within 3 days. I am so grateful to Josie and the staff at The Inn At The Market. Thank you all so very much for your kindness.We will look forward to our next visit to your beautiful city and especially to The Inn At The Market.

<Content>location, ambiance, luxury--what more could you want? We had but one night in Seattle on a tour of the pacific northwest and we wanted to be able to have a great view and experience downtown Seattle. What a great choice we made with the Inn at the Market. We were upgraded to a full water view, which was fabulous! The room was not huge, but the view made up for that, and everything about the hotel was first-rate, from check-in to check-out. The rooftop garden was incredible--even at the beginning of October, we were able to sit out for both breakfast and cocktail hour, enjoying the view and the weather. Being right next to the Pike Market was terrific--we enjoyed the shopping and eating. This is a great hotel and the perfect spot to experience Seattle!

<Content>Great place to stay in Seattle Inn at the Market is a wonderful place to stay in Seattle. The expense is a bit more then I usually spend but it was worth it because the hotel is located right next to Pike's Place Market. The view can't be beat in all Seattle. There's a wonderful balcony to watch a romantic sunset. When checking in at the hotel my husband and I were pleasantly surprised to receive a room upgrade to a suite. Since we were celebrating our anniversary it made the stay that much more special. I only wish we were able to stay a little longer then planned. The bed was very comfortable due to the quality of the mattress. I wanted to take it home with me. The front desk staff were very helpful in making a dinner recommendation and reservation for us. Again we were surprised when we were greeted at the restaurant (Cutter's) with ribbon decorations and a candle on the table. The hotel treated us to an appetizer also. We felt like VIPs. I recommend the Inn at the Market for a romantic getaway in an exciting city.

<Content>Excellent Boutique Hotel Recently we celebrated our 38th wedding anniversary at Inn At The Market. We stayed two nights on our first visit and then returned for one night the following week after visiting British Columbia. Both stays at IATM were delightful and exceeded our expectations in every way. Our accommodations were beautiful and the location of the Inn is excellent for exploring the city. The terrace on the fifth floor is perfect for relaxing during the day or evening. From the moment we booked our reservations we could not have asked for a more professional, friendly, or helpful staff. Everyone on the IATM team went out of their way to insure that our time with them was indeed special. We are especially grateful to Mr. Watkins and Ms. Cervantes for their kindness and thoughtfulness. Our sincere thanks to all for helping make our 38th anniversary celebration a most memorable occasion. The IATM will always be our choice in Seattle!

<Content>Excellent Hotel What a great hotel and the best position with views over the harbour. Each afternoon spent watching the sun go down over the water enjoying a drink on the roof top area. Very close to the makets and city shopping area. Staff were only too heapful to assist with directions.Some rooms dont have views so the higher the better facing the harbour

<Content>Perfect location; great stay We needed a hotel for just one night, prior to departing on a cruise. This hotel was perfect for us. Great location, just steps from the Market. We enjoyed walking around the area. We booked two rooms; both were clean and comfortable but on the small side. Bellmen went out of their way to help us and give info on the area. We really loved the fifth-floor terrace. We enjoyed both an afternoon snack and breakfast there; we picked up food from a couple of the many nearby eating places. We highly recommend the cheese shop at the bottom of the hill.I would probably choose this hotel again when returning to Seattle.

<Content>location, location, location This is a great boutique hotel. It is not the typical huge, rubber stamp type facility. We loved this hotel. The bell men and front desk staff were great. They went out of their way to make sure our stay was great. We were there for our 25th anniversary. We arrived and found two chocolate strawberries situated on our already turned down bed. A large bucket of ice was ready for champagne. The bed was very comfy and we were delighted to find it was a Temperpedic (memory foam) bed, which is what we have at home. We spent two nights at the Inn at the Market before a cruise to Alaska and one night upon our return. Literally every staff member made sure to mention that all staff were trained to help with conceirge duties and they were all very helpful to help us find our way around, providing maps and bus information. We ate breakfast across the street in the market, where you are really hardpressed to not find a large variety of food. The other morning we had pastry and coffee in a french pastry shop just down the street. We picked up great fruit to snack on in our room. We ate at Etta's one night and had delicious fresh oysters, halibut and fabulous coconut creme pie for dessert. One night we selected a variety of cheeses, crab, bread, olives, berries, peaches and things from various shops in the market. We bought some wine from Cost Plus, just down the street and had a little picnic up on the 5th floor deck. It was great! Gosh, we just had a great time and the situation of the hotel made it perfect for a nap before dinner and stopping back in to drop off packages. We were greeted each time we came and left by the very friendly staff. The staff called for cabs for us when we needed to get to far away destinations. They were wonderful!! So, a nice clean room, comfy bed, great bathroom, perfect location, great garden deck to watch the bustling crowd below. They have coffee/tea in the lobby....as much as a person could possibly want! I scampered down in my bathrobe once and nobody seemed to care.....just like most boutique hotels, you sort of feel at home. So...if you are looking for convenience, great staff, nice hotel...not cookie cutter...this is the place. I am surprised to read some of the less than favorable reviews. Perhaps these will make it easier for folks like me to get reservations. I spoke with a number of people up on the 5th floor deck who always stay at the Inn and know that a reservation well in advance is necessary. It seemed the saavy travelers enjoyed this facility. The others may be more comfortable in one of the corporate high rises. But for us.....we will be at the Inn and tell our family to also stay here.

<Content>We had a very nice experience at the Inn at the Market! We stayed at the Inn at the Market over a long Labor Day weekend. I've read a lot of mixed reviews on the Inn and all I can say is we had a really nice experience there.We're not big on paying a lot for a view in any hotel room because we just don't spend that much time in our room so we opted for a city view. We were in room 408 and it has a view of the courtyard that you walk through as you enter the hotel. For a view of the water, we were very satisfied with simply going up to the 5th floor deck where you had an unlimited view of Elliot Bay, Mt. Rainier, the waterfront and everything you'd see if you had a water view room. We took so many pictures from the deck and just stood there and admired the view. It was a nice place to strike up a conversation with other guests and overall, a nice place to escape the hustle of the Market area below.Our room was lovely and spacious and we saw no signs of any of the wear and tear that some reviews have mentioned. The bathroom in our room was the size of a small bedroom! And one thing I really loved about the bathroom was the shelving unit available for us to put our bathroom things on. Every hotel should offer this so that you don't have to live completely out of your suitcase or have a thousand things on the back of the toilet simply for them to be handy.The tempurpedic bed got a mixed review. I had no issues with it and found it quite comfortable. My husband...not so much. He would have liked a firmer mattress and he said he felt as if he was sleeping on his head the entire time. Overall though, it was fine.We don't normally make a lot of use of concierge services, etc. and we're not big users of room service either so I can't speak a lot about that. We did order dessert through room service one night and it was very nice. For breakfast, we went to the Market Bagel shop over on 1st Ave. (about 1/2 block south of the hotel) for a very inexpensive breakfast a couple of days. One day we walked a few blocks to a nearby coffee shop (no, not Starbucks...we avoided corporate coffee), Cafe Ladro. VERY good coffee and pastries and worth the 6 or 7 blocks to walk.Dinners were mostly eaten in and around the Market area. We can highly recommend Shiro Sushi (again, within easy walking distance) and it was highly recommended to us by one of the front desk staff. (Just a tip: Ivar's is so overrated don't waste your time. We live in the Midwest and we've had fish here that was so much better than that Long John Silver's knockoff.)The Market area itself is a zoo. If you don't like walking into people/crowds in general, you'll go nuts here after a couple of days. Granted, we were there over a holiday weekend and during the last day of Bumbershoot but even after that ended, it was still nuts. It really wasn't the crowds that got to us so much as the buskers (annoying with a capital A and basically everywhere you turn) and the seemingly endless supply of insane people. That was our biggest takeaway from Seattle: is every third person on the street insane? Not that we ever felt threatened, quite the contrary. But we had people just randomly yell at us (and everyone else around them), hiss at us like a cat, skateboard by us singing a song about Chairman Mao...it seemed to never end. I guess you can call it free street theatre.The Inn is in the midst of all this and we were definitely at the heart of all the action. The bell staff was incredibly friendly, the front-desk staff was helpful, the room was very nice, the location was tourism ground zero. Not really sure how we could have improved on the experience. (Oh and it was sunny and 68 every day we were there! So much for the Seattle drizzle experience!) Honestly if I had one complaint it would be the TV channel selection. There are about 20 channels, half of which are sports, the other half local government and news. Boring, boring, boring. But again, we don't go on vacation to watch TV. But if you're looking for something interesting to watch as you fall asleep...good luck to you my friend.If we were going back to Seattle and wanted to stay in the city itself, I wouldn't hesitate to go back to Inn at the Market.

<Content>Big Disappointment Went there for a weekend getaway. Very disappointed at the low level of service: no room service during the day (after 5:30 only), stains on the sheets, loud A/C that was alternately freezing and hot  stuffy, bellman about ran me down as I was trying to get out of the elevator, furniture getting pretty worn, bad breakfast.Will not be back and cannot recommend it. 2 star hotel at a 4 star rate.

<Content>Convenient Pluses for Inn at the Market - comfy bed, decent sized room with two cozy arm chairs, convenient to stroll Pike Place MarketMinuses - when we read boutique hotel we expect something special. We were disappointed. Nonexistent concierge service is one of our gripes. Also, for an 8 story boutique hotel where you would expect above average service, we were surprised to see the note that we must make our room available by 9:00 AM or we would not be serviced AT ALL! Hey, we're on vacation, would like to sleep later. Food recommendation for breakfast by the front desk staff was awful. We did better with coffe and croissants in Pike Place Market. I'm just glad we chose a less expensive street view room rather than the $325 one.

<Content>Inn Okay, Not Memorable We were spending four days in Seattle prior to flying to Alaska, and after reading many reviews of different Seattle hotels, I chose this hotel on the basis of the Tripadvisor reviews. Every review I saw was glowing, and I also liked the location. We travel frequently and have stayed in many different hotels, both chain and otherwise. I have to say we were somewhat disappointed. The location is very nice, true. The hotel was nice inside, but we never saw the reason for the glowing reviews. The room was nice but not exceptional. The men who bring in luggage and get you cabs went to great lengths to help us. The desk staff was certainly very pleasant and helpful, but at least two of them didn't know how to put us in touch with a company who could take us to Mt. Rainier. There are no brochures available in the lobby, and when the desk person went looking in a drawer, he had difficulty finding a brochure for this major attraction. I finally suggested Gray Line myself, and he made the phone call for us, but then gave us incorrect information (and I saw later why he thought that he was accurate---I don't blame him for that). My husband found out later on that there was a concierge somewhere on site, but in four days we never saw him/her or even knew of his/her presence. The hotel needs better visible information for tourists---at the very least, brochures should be somewhere. In addition, once we did book our tour, we asked for a wake up call that never came. Fortunately I always set my cell phone. We came away feeling that while our stay there was fine, we had had similar fine experiences in the chain hotels all over the US. We felt that it wasn't worth the extra money.

<Content>You won't find a better place than this! We just returned from a weekend stay at the Inn. We wanted a great room in a great location as we were without a car. This is THE place to stay in Seattle if you are interested in wandering the streets on foot and sightseeing the Pike Place Market neighborhood. You are right across the street from the Market and in the middle of great shopping and restaurants. It is only about a few blocks to West Lake Centre and the monorail to the Space Needle. When you get tired of strolling around this great city just head back to your beautiful room at the Inn. If you are wondering where good customer service has gone, look no further. The Inn has obviously put alot of effort into hiring/training customer focused staff. Don't waste your time or money looking anywhere else.

<Content>~ Seattle Boutique Hotel We visited Seattle for a week in July and stayed at this wonderful hotel overlooking Pike's Market. Our spaciouis room was on the top floor with a partial water view that was stunning. The roof top garden is the place to relax above the bustle of the city. I highly reccomend this property. The city is very noisy at night, so close your windows and turn on the fan and you will sleep well! Be sure and get over to Hurricane Ridge, and kayak on Lake Union. Ladies, Nordstrom's basement store is a 5 min walk from the hotel!

<Content>Really enjoyed staying at the Inn at the Market Stayed one night at this exceptional hotel. We were upgraded to a suite overlooking the market and water. There is also a rooftop area with chairs and tables that all guests can use that overlooks both market and water. The staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms were nice and clean. All areas of hotel were well taken care of. It was close to the market and waterfront and a block away from the tour bus that you can get on and off at different stops. Would stay there again.

<Content>Great Location, friendly staff We stayed in the hotel over Easter and throughly enjoyed our time there. It is superably located for exploring Seattle especially the Market and the rooms were of a good size.The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful and the reception area is very welcoming.Our only 'criticism' would be that our room was next to a fire exit stairwell and at night we could hear the rumbling of what I assume was something like the air conditioning pipes.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! The hotel was very nice and in a great location if you want to get out and see seattle by foot. The upper deck offers a great view of the market and the the bay. We drank coffee in the morning and capped our nigts watching the sun set drinkng a nice glass of wine on the deck. The service was great and the employees were great to deal with. Our room was very nice and big enough for what we needed.

<Content>Fantastic waterview and exceptional location We just returned from a 3 week trip to the Northwest and Alaska. The Inn at the Market was the first hotel we stayed at. It still stands out as a hotel that I would recommend to friends going to Seattle. I booked this hotel directly and immediately had the feeling I would be happy there. The girl on the other end of the line could not have been more friendly or willing to please. When we arrived we were quickly taken up to our room and famiiarized with what the room had to offer. We had booked a two story suite which was perfect for my husband, myself and daughter. We all had our privacy and my daughter had a separate tv and pull out couch that was made up immediately on request. We all had the same great view of the water and the public market. The hotel has a lovely patio that overlooks the water. It is raised so provides a wonderful view. My daughter and I went out there after dinner and had a wonderful relaxing chat about our day before going upstairs to bed. The only negative would be that there is only one bathroom and it is upstairs (and the stairs would not be good for someone handicapped although my husband struggles with walking because of car accident and he had no complaints) so if you aren't a good sharer and you are traveling with more then your spouse/friend take this into consideration. We had friends come in from Vancouver the last night of our stay and the hotel was very good about finding us last minute reservations for five to accomodate their arrival time. I will say that we were very lucky weatherwise and that on foggy, drizzly or rainy days that our impressions might not have been quite so good but that would not be the hotel's fault. I have also read other reviews from fellow travelers that did not give the hotel high marks for rooms with city views because of noise. However, I always think you get what you pay for. One other big plus for this hotel is its proximity to the Public Market. It is literally a two minute walk. Bingo! and if you are a Starbucks fan the original store is about a 4 minute walk......

<Content>Quintessential Seattle Inn at the Market was an absolutely exquisite experience, made all the more so because it was a surprise gift from my teenage daughter. She knew that I had been lusting to stay at this jewel of a boutique hotel ever since I read the wonderful review which Sunset Magazine gave it. Every time we passed by it when strolling through Pike Market, I would say: I wish we could stay one night at Inn at the Market. We live less than an hour's drive from Seattle in the Tacoma area, so we don't usually do overnights in Seattle. Besides, we are loyal Best Western guests, and Inn at the Market is more than double the rate of even the finest Best Western motel.Inn at the Market is quintessential Seattle - friendly, casual yet elegant, pleasing to the senses, practical. For reasons unknown, we were upgraded to a suite with gorgeous water views (my daughter insists she did not tell the hotel that we were celebrating my 55th birthday). The location can't be beat - in the heart of Pike Market, next to a fine (but pricey) French restaurant. The hotel itself houses a breakfast and lunch cafe which we wish we had tried, as the food fragrances were yummy and the place was packed. All day in-and-out valet parking (extra charge) made it easy to tour Seattle without fearing the loss of precious parking.In short - this wonderful Seattle hotel is worth the splurge in every way, shape, and form. Claire B - thanks for leading me to this place. Nancy W - your love and generosity made this hotel an added beautiful experience.

<Content>Best in Seattle For my first visit to Seattle I chose this hotel because it seemed to have the best location. When I arrived I found out that I was exactly right. The views from the rooftop patio were Fantastic. The bedrooms were perfect with great amenities, i.e. designer shampoos/soaps, bed was memory foam, bathroom was clean and gorgeous. The staff were not far from my age(24) and when I needed advice on where to go for drinks they gave me their best. Everyone that worked there was perfect. When I return to Seattle this is likely the only place where I will stay. The Best!

<Content>Nice location but request a decent room! The location is fabulous if you want to be in the center of Pike Street Market. However, I had the absolute worst room in the entire hotel. They said, city view. I had a view of a red brick wall. After a long day of travel, I wanted a bath. They had given me a handicapped room. The room was larger than say a Hilton and nice appointments, but nothing special. No one ever asked how my stay way or I would have told them. If they had let me know the room was so so it might have helped. I don't think they were even close to full either. I was on the floor with the conference rooms. What a joy in the morning. Thank goodness I met up with a friend to walk around Seattle and stay out late - Wild Ginger is fabulous!

<Content>Excellent in every way We stayed at the Inn at the Market over Memorial Day weekend. Our room was large and had a great view of the water (we'd made sure to request that way in advance). The hotel was quiet and though fully booked, never seemed crowded. Service was impeccable and the whole staff was well-mannered and friendly. I can't find any fault with anything.It's in a great location right next to Pike Place Market, near lots of great restaurants like Etta's and Chez Shea.

<Content>The best customer service anywhere at any price This is my first 5 dot TripAdvisor review. I didn't think I would ever give that to any hotel.This place is amazing! Perfect location, incredible rooms, and the finest men and women in customer service I've ever experienced.We check in, and immediately people know you by name and greet you. Every day I was greeted, and everything I needed was retrieved immediately.I got to my room. The toilet was running slightly, so I called down and it was fixed, including replacement parts, within a matter of minutes. I needed a rollaway for an extra guest.. it was provided at turndown later that evening and was turned down and made like a regular bed. I needed an extension cord, as we had two laptops and a assortment of other devices to plug in. It was at my room within 2 or 3 minutes.The bed was a firmer variant of the memory foam beds, and was amazing. They only offer queen size beds in this hotel, but since I was single this time around, that wasn't an issue. I never slept better in a hotel.The bathroom was amazing. It was half the size of the room, at least, and had plenty of space for 2 people and their toiletries. It had several lighting options as well. You could change it from late night to boardroom with an assortment of switches. In addition, I felt the supplied soaps and shampoos were excellent and felt no need to augment them.Every hallway, restroom, and staff member was immaculate in apperance and maintenance. I was not missing anything and I DID NOT want to leave.

<Content>Absolute Fabulous Inn Enough good things cannot be said about this property. From the time I called the Inn to book until my departure, the entire staff at this hotel was above and beyond excellence. I stayed one night pre-cruise on May 2 and was upgrade to a suite which overlooked the city/market area. The rooms were huge and the bed with the temp. mattress was to die for. Ordered room service which was very prompt and delicious. The greatest thing about my stay was the staff on duty that day. Everyone was extremely helpful in all manners and most pleasant. If every hotel had this particular staff, rooms would be over booked. If you have time, definitely use the fifth floor terrace for a cocktail. It overlooks the market and has great sunsets.......all this while watching the ships come and go. Such a peaceful late afternoon cannot be beat! I was sad to go the next morning at check-out.....when in Seattle I will always stay at this property.

<Content>Amazing Location with Great Views Fabulous boutique hotel adjacent to the fish market in Seattle. We stayed here for one short night before heading to Vancouver Island on our honeymoon, and we loved it. The service was great, and the front desk pointed us to a great spot for sandwiches at 10pm on a Sunday (not easy to do!) - the hotel had even put adorable chocolate covered strawberries in our room decorated like a bride and groom. This was a thoughtful and cute touch. We didn't have much time to explore the area around the hotel, but the room was very clean, we had a pretty view of the water/market and the bathroom was nicer than a standard hotel bathroom. We had brunch in the morning at the little breakfast place, which was tasty and hit the spot before our drive to the ferries.Oh, and the hotel has a cool outdoor patio on one of the higher floors that offers really incredible views.A stone's throw to Pike Place Market, too!

<Content>such ennui Stayed here earlier this week and from the beginning met with annoying customer service staff - Felix especially a drama queen - and less than stellar accomodations. Soap/shampoo (Gilchrist and Solmes) same as used in Navy lodging. Our room came with a 'courtyard' view which is actually facing a brick wall. NO exercise facility, small business 'center' and some construction to boot. Most importantly, the room we held did NOT have a desk so how in the world can one begin to think about working. Would not stay there again...

<Content>Outstanding choice We reserved a city view room for one night last week. Upon checkin, the helpful desk staff Amy gave us a complimentary upgrade to the 8th floor water view. We had access to the large deck which overlooks seemingly everything. Checkin, housekeeping, valet services and checkout were smooth and friendly. The Pike Place Market is so close it's silly. The staff had great recommendations for breakfast and dinner without trying to steer us to their in house restaurant (which, from our last stay, I can say is absolutely excellent). The rooms are clean and well appointed. I have no reason to not reserve a room here next time-althought the Fairmont is a better choice if our kids come.

<Content>Loved this boutique hotel We stayed at the Inn at the Market for our anniversary a few years ago. After all this time, we still remember it very fondly and would love to return. The service was amazing. We had last minute car problems and the hotel came to our rescue, so we wouldn't miss the reservation. We loved being referred to by name when coming into the lobby. The conceirge was also fabulous. Yes, the rooms were small. However, they were very well appointed and I loved the city view. I happened to be in the room during housekeeping one day and the maid said to be comfortable while she brewed me a fresh pot of coffee, then poured and delivered it to me in the bone china cups provided in the room.

<Content>great location in a fabulous city I've stayed at this and many other Seattle hotels over the years, and Inn at the Market always comes through. The location is wonderful, rooms clean and comfortable. If you want to be downtown, Inn at the Market is a great place. Rooms in Seattle are getting pricey, and Inn at the Market is still a pretty good value.

<Content>Great atmoshpere and rooms. City View too noisy though. Pay for the better view Nice boutique hotel with super beds. We chose the City View package as we have stayed in Seattle many times and weren't planning on staying in the room too much.Unfortunately the City View rooms sit right on First Ave. Buses, vagrancy, street noise. Pretty tough environment.Would stay again but would chose to spend a bit more and have a view of the Sound.

<Content>great location, staff couldn't have been more helpful I wish we could have stayed longer, but our flight was delayed due to a snowstorm in Boston. We arrived very late at night and had been upgraded without asking. There was some construction going on the next morning so we were given a room on a higher floor to be further away from any noise disturbance.It was a minute or two walk from the Public Market. There was a lot to see within walking distance.The beds were extremely comfortable. the only down side was that you had to walk outside for a few seconds to get to some of the rooms.We had contact with many people at the front desk, all of whom were very happy to help and full of all kinds of information. We'd stay again and recommend it highly.

<Content>Whataplace!!! Terrific location, literally steps from Pike Place Market, just down the hill from 1st. We upgraded to a water view room, and had a great view from the sixth floor out onto Elliot Bay, counting the WA State ferries shuttling between Bainbridge Island and Bremerton to Seattle. The room was large, well appointed, and quiet. The property is interesting, given it has three eateries and a spa/salon integrated into the structure. But we ate elsewhere, since there is an abundance of great restaurants and specialty eateries within a short walking distance. Breakfast on First at Crumpets (wonderful), dinner at Etta's down the street on Western, and a wonderful reco from the desk staff right across the street at 94 Stewart. You have got to try the special avacado appetizer! Easy walk to major shopping and the monorail to the Space Needle. By the way, definitely eat at the retaurant at the top. The food was suprisingly good!We only spent two nights ... but based on the beautiful room and facility, proximity to the Market, the view, and the great staff, we will be back!

<Content>Class ACT I recently spent my 60th b-day at the Inn at the Market. I spent days searching through the list of hotels trying to find the perfect one. I wanted to wake up in a special hotel since I was really dreading this birthday. The minute we walked in the room we knew we were in the right place. The accomodations are huge and everything has a touch of class. The bed was so comfortable we didn't want to get up. I am a travel agent and would highly recommend this hotel. Linda Lawrence

<Content>Great Hotel What a great hotel! Good sized, clean rooms. Very helpful staff. Unbeatable location. Walk out the front door to Pikes Market and the original Starbucks. From the hotel, we walked to the underground tour (do that), the monorail (to Space Needle  Duck tours). Will stay there again.

<Content>Great for overnight or a week I have stayed at the Inn at the Market several times, both for business and holidays. I like its small feel and super-comfortable rooms. Great restaurants are within a very short walk (or in the courtyard). Avoid rooms on the 1st street side, especially the low floors, because of the traffic noise. If the weather is good, make sure you give the terrace some time.

<Content>Darling inn! I am a frequent contributor to TripAdvisor, and I often review the hotels where I have stayed. I chose Inn at the Market because of the great reviews on TripAdvisor, and I was very pleased! Staying at Inn at the Market was a great experience. The valet and front-desk staff were extremely friendly, welcoming, punctual, and helpful. My room was comfortable. I often feel in hotels like I don't really want to let my bare feet touch the floor, but my room felt like a comfortable home-away-from-home. I had not slept on a Tempurpedic bed before, and it was very comfortable. The bathrom was spacious, toiletries were lovely, and shower was well-designed. The Seattle Athletic Club down the street was terrific. It is $15/day to use the facilities there, but really worth it if you're someone who needs to work out while you're traveling. It was wonderful to be right in the heart of things in Seattle, too. I enjoyed walking around the fish market, stopping at the original Starbucks for tea in the mornings, and eating at nearby restaurant The Pink Door. The one disappointment for me was the lack of breakfast, not a huge deal since there is a restaurant attached to the inn where you can order breakfast (though it is sit-down, not quick take-out) and many other restaurants nearby, but a slight inconvenience. As long as you're prepared for that, and leave time to find breakfast elsewhere, this won't be an issue. The rooftop deck offered a lovely view of the Puget Sound. Turndown service each night with chocolate was a nice touch. I would definitely stay again for business or pleasure.

<Content>Had some drawbacks... My husband and I were excited about staying at the Inn at the Market, due to the great reviews. Our room was a standard one, with a somewhat disappointing view of the wall of the building across the courtyard, on the 3rd floor. Not a big deal, since we could go up to the rooftop terrace if we wanted a great view. I will say the best thing about the Inn was the location. Pike Place Market is a great place to leisurely explore, and it's right there. My husband walked down across the street every morning to get fresh hot croissants and coffee for breakfast, and we visited the bakeries many times for late night snacks.My biggest complaint was the Tempurpedic mattress. Everyone else in these reviews rave about them, but my back hated it! I have chronic low back pain anyway (and was 6 months pregnant when we went), and was really looking forward to some great sleep, but wound up hurting terribly. In fact, I wound up having to sleep sitting up in bed because laying down was so painful. On our 3rd day there I asked the person at the front desk if I could get a cot in my room because the bed was really uncomfortable to me and they told me it was against fire code. I don't know if that's the truth or not, but it sure wasn't what I wanted to hear. They didn't seem to care too much that a pregnant patron wasn't able to sleep at all on their beds.Smaller complaints: my husband and I stopped at the front desk to ask directions from Discovery Park over to the zoo, two of the places we were planning on visiting. The girl handed us a Budget rental car map and circled each place on there for us. She didn't try to help us out with the best route to take from one to the next, even though we asked, just pointed out each place again as if to brush us off. Obviously we can read a map and did find our way, but I was once again disappointed in the service. Also, the room was very noisy due to all the street noise, especially in the morning as trucks unloaded their stuff for the day at the market. It didn't bother us too badly, because we sleep with a white noise machine which helps to mask it. I can't imagine the racket we would have had to listen to without it. So be aware of that potential problem.Overall, our experience was still pleasant, though, mostly due to the location of the hotel. The room was clean, the bathroom large and nicely stocked, and the terrace view was really amazing. However, we can't go back because of the beds which is a shame. They should offer some rooms without the Tempurpedic mattresses.

<Content>Great view and location but rooms lack personality The inn is billed as a boutique hotel, however the room lacked charm. It was so generic, it felt like we were at a Holiday Inn (but for $300+ a night). It would be so easy for the hotel to add a few prints of the Public Market or original paintings sold at Pike Place...something that had to do with Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. Our room had a fantastic view of Elliott Bay. The Tempur Pedic bed was very comfortable, however the sales brochures for the mattress in the nightstand was a big turn-off.The bathroom was very large and stocked with top notch products. The front lobby and housekeeping staff were very helpful and room service arrived in record speed.

<Content>Great Place My husband  I just got back yesterday from Seattle. Our stay at The Inn at The Market was wonderful. I agree that the layout of the room is awkward for watching the television. The view from the 5th floor deck was breathtaking the setting was very relaxing. You are literally next door to the maket  there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. I loved the bath robes, turn down service  chocolates. The staff was friendly  eager to help in any way they could. Would stay again.

<Content>Great Experience We stayed at the Inn at the Market in Seattle during the second week of August and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel's location (literally) next to Pike Place Market is ideal! You can walk around the market to explore yet still walk around the city quite easily. The hotel is a bit on the expensive side, but really has a lot of qualities that make it very desirable. The rooftop terrace is awesome! The rooms sometimes have a weird arrangement (i.e. TV was at the side of the bed, so you had to lay on the bed sideways to watch). But overall the rooms were very nice with comfortable bedding, updated furniture, complimentary in-room internet access. The guest service was also excellent. Our check-in/check-out was pleasant and quick. The bell staff, valet parking staff, and housekeeping were always very helpful, timely, and accomodating. They also have a complimentary car service that can drop off/pick up for intown locations. Overall, we had a great stay and would certainly stay at this property again while visiting Seattle.

<Content>I loved this place! Yes, we payed $300 a night but we knew that going in and the hotel exceeded our expectations. We arrived early, around 11 am, and went into the Inn to store our luggage. We were told our room was ready so we were able to check in right then, wonderful news! The room and bathroom were large and the bed was extremely comfortable. Everything was tastefully appointed. Service was always immediate and professional. This was our first trip to Seattle and the location was outstanding! Pike Place Market was fabulous; a perfect blend of tourists and locals. We used the fifth floor deck every day. We really, really enjoyed our stay at Inn at the Market and would stay again.

<Content>great location We spent 3 nights at this hotel recently and loved it!! It IS expensive but we had one of the rooms with two doubles and had plenty of room for myself, my husband, and two teenage girls. The views are spectacular and the service is excellent. The rooftop is perfect for anytime of day. I went up early to read or late in the evening to relax. We could not get enough of the view and were within easy walking range of many sites and restaurants. I walked no more thatn two blocks in any direction in the mornings to sample different coffee shops.

<Content>expensive for what you get. not for biz travellers. The simple fact is the hotel's location is simply unbeatable.. a mere stone's throw away from Pike Market. Plenty of great restaurants to go to and it is generally a fun area to be in. That is if you are a tourist. However, the quality of the hotel itself is only so-so. This is not a place for business travellers. I might be a bit hard on them especially since I just returned from a trip to HK where I stayed at the Conrad HK and Wynn Macau. Compared to those the Inn feels like motel 6. Issues:1. There is no desks in the rooms to place your laptops on. Even if you have wireless internet, there is no place to work on but your bed. 2. Furniture and coverings are worned and just outdated. 3. Room 409 is a city view room. The last room they had for that date. Avoid at all cost because its window sits right above the bus stop. They claim that the windows are double paned but I could hear the buses' roaring engines. I had to sleep with ear plugs which they had at the front desk. 4. The AC is a standalone unit attached to the wall. This is not part of a central system. The standalone unit made quite a bit of noise. It looks cheap and tacky too. 5. There is no business center. Only a fax machine located in the basement of the hotel. For the price you pay you are paying for the location only. The staff are extremely friendly though. Folks should check out the fried doughnuts at the Dhalia Lounge.

<Content>Location This was my fifth or sixth visit to the Inn at the Market. The property is better than most: the lobby is handsome, the rooms comfortable (though a little tired and ready for renovation, especially in the case of the bathrooms), the sun deck overlooking the harbor is a treat, and the staff is welcoming. The related restaurants, including not only Campagne but the related bistro in the basement and the lively breakfast place located separately within the same building, are really good. But the whole ballgame here is the location. The views, if you are fortunate enough to have a water-view room, are simply stunning -- not only because of the comings and goings of ferry boats, freighters, liners, Coast Guard cutters, fishing boats, and pleasure craft, but also because of the astonishing mountain range visible across Elliott Bay, which catches the sunset in truly glorious ways. It is also a pleasure to be able to walk half a block down the steep hill to the Pike Place Market, with all its produce and its bustle of activity. There are countless restaurants and clubs within walking distance. As gentrification neuters most of downtown Seattle, this area remains edgy, even a little challenging if you go in certain directions at certain times. The area is not for you if you are uncomfortable with street people and occasional strong smells. It is also a little inconvenient for business; and the business services in the hotel are not comparable to those in a Hyatt or a Marriott. But the tradeoff is a real sense of place, something you can't get in other cities or in Seattle's uptown hotels.

<Content>pleasant We were in 706, wiith the taxes it was slightly over $400/night. We had a nice water view. When we had our windows open we got the traffic noises from hwy 99 and the noise and cooking smells from the restaurant Campagne. Location is good for first time tourists.The staff was helpful and nice, the rooms were clean and the housekeeping staff was excellent. The bathroom was spacious and clean but some what dated. There were limited TV channels -- no HBO, etc.All and all, a comfortable hotel but on the expensive side.

<Content>A view with a room. Spent two nights with my wife over the 4th. We had a bay view room that was more than we could have hoped for. Great view of the fireworks. This is a world unto itself after walking all day in Seattle. A great place to come back to. Pikes Place market is at your door step so the location is perfect. Try to stay as high ( as in floor height) as you can as the market opens early and there can be some noise. The beds are the posturepedic foam and are everything that they claim. We slept really well. I think if we ever go back to Seattle, this was our second time, we wouldn't stay anywhere else. Room service was right on time and all food we had in the room, and in the restaurants, was quite good.One other thing about the view, you have Mt. Renier to your left, facing the bay, and the snow capped Cascades in frount and to the right , it's postcard great.

<Content>Loved this Hotel!! I just returned from a wonderful 4 night stay at the Inn at the Market. The most wonderful feature of this boutique hotel is its location which is literally at the Pikes Pier market. It was wonderful to be able to simply step out of our hotel and walk through the market. From our hotel window we watched as the flower booths were setup, we watched cruise ships, ferries, and the bustle of the market activity. Wonderful. When we arrived we found that our room had only 1 queen bed and we expressed that we would prefer 2 queen beds. They made every effort to accommodate this request and we were given a room with a pullout sofa -- it suited us very well. The room was not large but it was very clean and well furnished and suited our needs. We also enjoyed the deck on the 5th floor which is nicely furnished with deck furniture and affords a great view of the water and the market. 4th of July firewords viewed from the deck are spectacular. We also found the staff to be very friendly and competent. All of the desk personnel are concierges. They booked several reservations and cruises for us. The only area which I felt could possibly be improved was the room service menu. The room service is provided by a restaurant which shares the courtyard called Campagne. We found the menu to be too limited and the items too obscure to be appealling. However it was of little matter since the area that the hotel is situated is surrounded by a large number of restaurants and eateries. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this lovely boutique hotel!

It was fun to walk out the door and be at the market too. We loved the deck, the room was nice and clean and the bed was the best! The chocolates on the turndown were so good! We would definately stay here again. Also we had a wonderful meal at Le Campagne and the waiter was the best.

<Content>Nice place! After a lunatic 20000+ miles of flying in the space of a few days, I had a night to kill in Seattle before an early trans-con flight back to NYC. Couldnt last out all night as was the original plan, so needed a hotel, and had none prebooked.This place was recommended to me , and was just a block or so from the excellent irish pub (kells) I just happened to have ended up in.Just one room left, at $220 inc tax.Excellent friendly staff, lovely decor, big rooms (im used to NYC so a rabbit hutch will seem big , but these were indeed spacious).Great views out over the water and it has free wi-fi, you just need to ask at reception for the access code. Place seemed spotless and nicely decorated, and more individual then the usual bland chain hotels that sadly prevail.The area felt fine-in the limited time I was there it seemed safe and near to bars, shops and the usual stuff. No drunken noise from the street either.It was very quiet, very comfortable and I slept well.Normally I like to add pictures and more detail to reviews, but due to the length of stay (or lack of it) I can't this time- sorry!When I return to Seattle this will be up there at the top of the list of hotels to use. Give it a try!

<Content>Inn at the Market We stayed at Inn at the Market for a long weekend and had a delightful experience. The staff was very helpful. We stayed on the 6th floor with a view of the Sound. By the little courtyard entrance was a great place for breakfast, Bacco. Also, two french restaurants, Campagne and Cafe Campagne. The Inn is within walking distance of many fine restaurants. The Market is just a short walk down the hill. It also features a nice patio overlooking the water. We will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Perfect Stay! My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights while I was attending a conference. It was worth the walk to the conference center to stay at the Inn at the Market - we had an eighth floor room which was exceptionally quiet and comfortable. The location next to the Public Market is unparalled - we loved the easy access to street food and activity. Our experience was totally positive and I would not stay anywhere else in Seattle!

<Content>Loved the hot apple cider Enjoyed the hot apple cider on the first 2 nights in the lobby and missed it tremendously on the 3rd night. Good location next to the pike market. Front desk staff are friendly and try to be helpful.Room smelled of tobacco though it is supposed to be non-smoking room. 2 glasses in the bathroom were chipped or cracked! Quite unexpected for a highly rated hotel. Didn't find the bed all that special too...Didn't find the deck very fantastic....maybe coz it's winter and the winds were too strong to stay in the deck for long....Room-wise it is a very average 3 star. Hotel wise it has a great location next to the market but that's about it. Was expecting more for the high price....

<Content>Okay, but not amazing My husband and I stayed here last weekend for one night. I had spent some time trying to find a great place to stay in Seattle. Read the tripadvisor reviews, saw that it was listed in TL Top 500 hotels, etc. Seemed like a pretty good bet it would be a fantastic place. It was great, fine...but just not really the amazing little boutique hotel I'd expected from the reviews and ratings. We thought the room was nice, but again, not incredible. The service could have been better too. The woman at the front desk was very friendly, but got a few things wrong. On another note -- if you are visiting Seattle, try to eat at Canlis. We had an incredible meal there!

<Content>Not impressed by the Inn My husband and I thought this an attractive little hotel. Rooms were on the small side, but nicely furnished. The rooftop garden deck was a nice photo-op, but too breezy in Sept. for lounging. Also, getting service for a glass of wine was a major undertaking. We finally had to go to the bar next door, order it, then come back and wait for the bellboy to deliver it. Didn't need a hassle after a long flight! Would probably stay elsewhere next time. Perhaps the Fairmont.

<Content>Wish I were still here!!! Inn at the Market will be the first call I make when next planning a visit to Seattle. The location is absolutely perfect and the water view rooms are just that; water view with a nice glimpse of the mountains. The staff are very accommodating and the beds are ultra comfortable. I was impressed by how well-priced their mini-bar items were and glad to not have to pay $6.00 for a bottle of water. The Inn is a must for anyone wanting to see Seattle at its best!

<Content>Wouldn't Stay Anywhere Else My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The location is great - so close to all the shopping areas and literally next door to Pike's Market. Lots of great restaurants in the area and the staff is very helpful at recommending them. Our room overlooked the street below but wasn't noisy at all. There is plenty of space in the rooms for luggage and the bathroom is big and bright. Excellent mattress as well. We can't wait to go back.

<Content>The best hotel ever! We spent a long time researching hotels in downtown Seattle for our 25th wedding anniversary. We are so glad/thankful we selected The Inn At The Market! It was perfect. We had a beautiful room overlooking Puget Sound. (Deluxe water view-8th floor) We watched the ferries and boats go by our window. The hotel was extremely quiet - it was like we were the only guests. We were treated kindly. On our arrival they set out a card and special chocolates for our anniversary. I can't say enough - I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very special place to stay. We plan to make this a yearly event - we had the best time!

<Content>great location A lovely hotel in a great location. The room was a good size and not too noisy even though it was on the town side. We enjoyed sitting on the terrace with a glass of wine. Just one point make sure that you check out in person. We did an express check out and then when we got our credit card bill found that they had charged us even though we had prepaid through Expedia. This was promptly sorted out but was inconvenient

<Content>Boutique Charmer in Great Location My wife and myself recently spent 5 nights at the Inn at the Market while I attended a convention. We had a very nice time at this small, comfortably furnished hotel that has a great location just up the hill from Pike Place Market. The walk to the convention center is about 8 blocks east, pretty easy except for the steep 1/2 block adjacent to the hotel. There are a number of trendy restaurants as you walk north on First Ave. and Pioneer Square with its old stone buildings and charming pergola is south along the same road. And of course, the market is a 1/2 block to the west and has many food stands, boutiques, fish and flower stalls, handicrafts, jewelry tables, entertainers, and ethnic dining options that spill onto the narrow alleys and covered arcades. It was a pleasure to wake up in the morning and grab something to eat nearby while watching the small trucks and vans unload their wares and the vendors set up their tables.Our room was on the corner overlooking the city and was very spacious, with lots of storage space in the wardrobe and a large bathroom. The sink was a pedestal-type, so spreading out toiletries was limited to the glass shelf or nearby small table/shelf unit. We could hear traffic noise from the street, which was annoying, but we did request their lowest-priced room and it is in the city, so I wasn't expecting total silence when we closed the doors. The rooms have window seats with pillows, a nice feature that makes the rooms appear bigger and provides additional seating or a good spot for reading while people-watching. The decor is contemporary, with beiges, browns, and blacks predominating. In good weather, the upstairs terrace would be a nice place to sit and enjoy the views of the bay and the market.The modern, brick building surrounds a pleasant courtyard with a splashing fountain/sculpture adjacent to some outdoor seating for the hotel restaurant. The lobby opens off the courtyard and has a fireplace, stuffed chairs, and the registration desk, where the helpful staff operates.We enjoyed our time here. The hotel is a nice option for those who don't want a large convention hotel in a central Seattle location. Do be aware that Seattle does have its share of street people and that there are a couple of strip clubs near the front of Pike Place Market.

<Content>Great views from terrace but only a brick wall from our window.... We stayed here for one night before heading off into the Cascade mountains. We arrived after 14 hours of travelling from the UK. Our room was very comfortable, not huge, but okay, whereas the bathroom was very spacious, enormous walk in shower, plenty of toiletries. We were very disappointed though when we opened the curtains and found our 'city view' was in fact a brick wall about 6 feet away. If we had been staying longer we would have asked to be moved, although we did ask when we checked in if any waterview rooms were available and were told no. It was very obvious though later in the evening when we were sitting on the terrace that only a few were occupied. We took other peoples advice and went up to the deck with a bottle of Champagne - (glasses from reception). The views and the spectacular sunset certainly made up for the brick wall outside our window! Beware - if you arrive on a Monday or Tuesday evening there is no room service. Not what you want to hear after a very long day and only airline food to sustain you. Also every restaurant in the immediate vicinity was closed - only place we could get a sandwich was a Deli round the corner.Position is great next to Pike Place Market but when we returned to Seattle after a few days, we stayed at the Marriott Waterfront. We actually preferred its location near the aquarium and cruise terminal, still only a couple of minutes from Pike Place.Not really any atmosphere compared to the Marriott.

<Content>Perfectly Great! After much researching of hotel properties for our four-night stay in Seattle after a cruise to Alaska, I chose the IATM. It couldn't have been more perfect for our stay. It was right AT the market, close to all restaurants, shops, coffee shops etc. The room was quite small but staff accomodated our request for a high floor (8th). Clean and well maintained and the personnel were efficient and very polite. Repaired a running toilet within a very short time, after complaint. Deck on 5th floor overlooking Elliott Bay is a plus, to be outdoors and relaxing with a view in a large city is a nice touch. My concern was coming from sunny Florida, I planned for four rainy days in Seattle and wanted to be within proximity to everything, which we were. Were very lucky with sunshine most of the time. Hotel was great. Would be our choice next time!!!

<Content>Pike Market next door The Inn at the Market was great hotel with the entrance tucked in an alley way. Beautiful rooms were large with a view of the harbor. We were right next door to Pike Market and a block from the waterfront where we took the Lock Cruise. Great cruise! Several restaurants and shops are near the hotel. We walked everywhere. I didn't realize there were so many hills in Seattle. The walk to Pioneer Square was only five blocks, but the homeless and decay in that area was a drawback. The Underground Tour was worth the walk! We caught a bus back to the hotel since they were free in the downtown area. We had to use valet parking for our car at $25 a night. Parking was too hard to find in that area. I thought that the rooms were overpriced too, but I guess hotels can overcharge in August.

<Content>Good, but not as nice as it used to be We've stayed here many times over the past 5 years and have always had a great experience, but this trip showed the hotel is losing it's high rating. Their attention to detail (lack of maintenance) is showing. Carpets dirty, a disgusting strong perfume stench used by housekeeping to try and cover odors in the hallways. Smoking allowed in a non-smoking hotel. Many little details are being over looked. The location and view are still the best for hotels in this area but the room and maintenance are average at best. We will try other hotels over this one in the future - at 355.00 a night I was very disappointed!

The room was well decorated and clean. I liked the bathrobes and the chocolates waiting for me when I checked in. The best thing about this hotel though is the location. You are one block way from the market and great shopping. Even on a Wednesday morning it was bustling and teaming with life.

<Content>Loved the inn The Inn at the Market was awesome. You can not beat the location right at the market. The room was very large and the beds are really comfortable. Our room had a partial view of Elliot Bay. Don't miss the rooftop deck which has to have the best view in Seattle short of the Space Needle. The staff was very friendly. Highly recommended. We'll be staying there again in the future.

<Content>Best hotel in Seattle My partner and I had a fantastic stay at the Inn at the Market hotel. The beds certainly lived up to their reputation, they were very welcome after our long flight from the UK. We were more than impressed by the efficient and friendly staff, and the comfortable clean rooms. You also can't ask for a better location, so close to Pike Place Markets. We would recommend the hotel to anyone, and would not stay anywhere else but Inn at the Market in Seattle. One word of warning, we would not recommend the Bacco cafe for breakfast, it was a complete rip off, you would be best to head down to the markets for something to eat.

<Content>Couldn't have asked for a better hotel experience! Everything about this hotel is perfect. We stayed in a townhouse suite for two nights and wish we could have stayed a month. As soon as we walked in our room and opened the windows, we could see that we had a million dollar view! We could see both the skyline of the city as well as Pike's market (it's literally about 50 feet away), the water, and the mountains in the distance. The room was two levels with a kitchenette and living room downstairs and bedroom and bathroom upstairs. The bose radio was great - in fact we never even turned on the television! The beds were really comfortable, and the linens were top-notch. Okay, now on to the service: in one word, fantastic. It's extremely important to me to be greeted with a casual and genuine manner every time I enter or leave a hotel, with eye-contact.... sounds easy, but it's a rarity in today's hotel market. No matter when we came or went, we were always greeted with a smile and eye contact - I really love that. The staff was more than helpful and always went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that we were well taken care of, that we knew about the great places to see and wonderful restaurants to dine at.Some hotels just don't get it, but Inn at the Market definitely understands that excellent service is what hospitality is all about. I'd much rather stay at a small, intimate property like this where I'm taken care of than in some monstrous hotel. Kudos to the staff and management for making this a fabulous hotel experience!!!

<Content>Mrs. Havesham moves to Seattle We last stayed at Inn at the Market, Seattle's boutique darling overlooking the Sound west of First Avenue, in 2001. At the time it seemed charming, luxurious, well-managed, and well-positioned to walk the downtown area. When we returned in June, 2006, we found the property in exactly the same state, down to the carpets and the paint job, only five years older. Like the dowager in Dickens' Great Expectations, this old dame hadn't moved in five years (OK, Mrs. Havesham didn't move in 20), and no amount of air spray could cover up the decay. The area around the hotel has likewise declined, such that a stroll towards Pioneer Square had all the patina of a Fellini film, replete with panhandlers, stoners, bikers, and guys with pants well below their plumber's line for ease of repulsive viewing.Restaurants in Pioneer Square appeared dirty and the famed Skid Row area has returned as a flexible homeless folks' hangout. Too bad a city as wealthy as Seattle can't cope with the needs of its least able. While I see a potential synergy between quarters for the homeless and the rooms at the Inn, I suspect the $500/night rates might prove a bit daunting.I continue to give stars for friendly, professional service, regardless of a property's physical condition, and the employees at the Inn are thoroughly helpful. But they can't take the cigar smokers off their own balcony, nor the drunk, nocturnally screaming frat boys from the adjacent streets. I hear the Four Seasons is opening a new hotel in the Fall....

<Content>Stylish, comfortable, great location It was great to stay so close to the market, with all the shops, restaurants, and food purveyors in easy walking distance. The hotel was very stylishly decorated, and the lobby area had just been redone (still smelled slightly of paint). Our room was unexpectedly large, and so was the bathroom. It seemed a bit of a waste of space to have such a large bathroom but only have a regular size tub with in-tub shower (and the shower head was not on a hose, which I missed). Still, it was trendily decorated in the Pottery Barn style, and clean and quite comfortable. Our room overlooked the harbor, which was great and made it a bit quieter.The amenities, comfort, style, and location made it a great place to explore Seattle from. The staff could use some work in terms of turning this into a top-notch service hotel. Two examples: 1) The first night we arrived late (10pm) and asked about places we could get a bite to eat. First, the (young) man behind the desk recommended their own restaurant for desserts. I then asked if there were any nearby tapas places (and I pronounced it in correct Spanish tah-pahs rather than taa-paas). He just stared at me for a moment, then said there were a couple of places just down the street. Turns out, he was directing me to two strip clubs (he thought I said topless). I am a 46 year old woman, and was with my husband. Seems pretty unlikely that I would be asking about topless bars, and he must have thought that or he wouldn't have stared so. Didn't it occur to him to ask me to repeat myself, or to look puzzled and ask me to describe the type of place I was looking for? Inexperience, I guess. After wandering up and down the street, and seeing The Lusty Lady and Showgirls, but no tapas restaurants, my husband and I did get a big laugh. 2) There is no place to park near the hotel--you have to use their valet parking, where you drop your car off right in front of the hotel. The second night we were there, the street in front of the hotel was closed and we couldn't get to the valet area. We drove around for 15 minutes, trying to find a different way in. We finally had to move some police barriers on another street and sneak in to get in front of the hotel. The desk was apologetic, but shrugged it off. And it must happen regularly--in the morning it was clear that the street was closed due to bigger happenings at the market on a Saturday. How difficult would it have been for the hotel to move its little valet parking sign and the valets and have the guests drop their cars off at the corner, 30 feet away?These are minor glitches, but for $300+ a night, you expect a hotel to work these sorts of kinks out of the system. Other than that, we had a nice time.

<Content>When can I come back??? We loved this hotel! It was cozy, not stuffy or snobbish at all, and the service was fantastic. You can feel it when you walk in the door. We had a great view, our room was beautiful and quite large with huge bay windows. This hotel has great ambiance and it is in the perfect location. Go to the market (next door!) and get some wine, meats and cheese. Ask for a bottle opener and glasses from the front desk. Now go out on the rooftop deck and watch the beautiful sunset. You will catch yourself trying to figure out a way to live at this hotel. And... what a bargain! In retrospect, I would have paid hundreds more. I can't believe this hotel isn't number one in Seattle.

<Content>Nice, but needs some undating My husband and I stayed at the Inn at the Market to celebrate his birthday, and overall, our stay was wonderful. We enjoyed a two-story suite with an incredible view of the Market and Sound. It was quiet and the location was perfect for us. My only complaint would be that the hotel needs to do a better job at keeping up with maintainance. Our room had major scratches on several walls and a few too many stains on the carpets. There were also many cracks in the bathroom tile and other significant signs of wear in the bathroom. For the price, we expected much more in regards to quality and upkeep. Hopefully, management will pay more attention to keeping this lovely hotel fresh and lovely.

<Content>Life Is Good My Daughter and I stayed at the Inn At The Market on April 24 after a four day trip to Vancouver BC. We arrived at midnight from Vancouver. (Hint-- the USA/Canadian boarder is a nightmare...we waited over three hours to get across, and were told a four to six hour wait on the weekend is not unusual.....make sure you leave either very early in the morning or late at night.) Greg the night front desk person, gave us an absolutely wonderful welcome.He upgraded us from a cityview room to a breath taking end-room on the 6th floor!!.We woke to the sounds and smells from the famous Pike Street Market....The location was incomparable! Good restaurants,great boutique shopping, and if you need mainstream...Macy's is three blocks away. I have stayed at the Monaco, and the Grand Hyatt in Seattle....I will never go back.....this is my new Hotel of choice.

<Content>Great for Vacation, Less So for Business Travelers Inn at the Market offers a superb location near Seattle's Pike Place Market, as well as tranquil, well-appointed guest rooms. The hotel is steps from the excellent Campagne restaurant (pricey but worthwhile), the superb 94 Stewart Street (marvelous modern American fare with exceptional wine and cheese choices) and numerous other notable restaurant choices. There is excellent shopping nearby.I recommend Inn at the Market unreservedly for those on vacation in Seattle. The staff is friendly, the room is comfortable and restful, and the location cannot be improved upon. One small quibble: no lobby shop for sundries, and unfortunately the hotel is some distance from a drugstore.If you are a business traveler (as I was), I might send you elsewhere (perhaps to the Vintage Park, the Monaco, or the Olympic Four Seasons) for the following reasons:  (1)No desk with task lighting. Although there was a windowed table in my room, it did not have task lighting nearby. I had to order a flashlight to read paperwork while working on my computer at night. (2)Staff will not put Fed Ex charges on your room account. Yes, they will (after some idiscussion) charge your credit card for Fed Ex, but it would be easier to just have the charge added to your room, as most business-oriented hotels will do.Bottom line: lovely place for leisure travelers, but needs a few changes to be top-notch for those in Seattle for business purposes.

<Content>Nice place! Just got back from a week in this nice City. Stayed at another, high end hotel the first three nights which was exceptional, but priced a bit high. The last two nights we stayed at the Inn. Excellent location, helpful employees, and very nice rooms. It is a very fair price for all of the reasons I just mentioned. The roof top patio was really very beautiful and worth it (if the weather is nice) all by itself. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel in fact if we go back in the future, this would be my first pick!

<Content>the best location, still a bit overpriced We stayed at the Inn at the Market for a weekend getaway in Seattle. The hotel is nice, and the location cannot be beat, I challenge you to find a more centrally located place to stay in downtown Seattle. The rooms are above average, the bathrooms are huge and very nice. I must echo a previous negative review, however, and state that at this price range I'd expect a lot more. We paid $165 a night at the IATM, and only $200 at the Sheraton on a previous trip. While the Sheraton wasn't as centrally located as the IATM, you felt like you were staying in a $200/night hotel, it was very nice. A few things stand out at the IATM:1. Valet parking is very expensive at $25 a night. Expedia notes that there is a free parking option, that's apparently not correct. In fact, there's no alternative to valet parking at all unless you want to park in an outdoor, unsecure lot a block away.2. Ceiling lights out in our room that housekeeping didn't fix, even after pointing it out to them.3. Telephone didn't work, the only way you could get out was to dial 0.4. Television in our room was inexplicably located directly to the left of the bed. To watch TV required one to sit sideways on the bed or lay on your side.5. The foam posturpedic beds, which I hear a lot of people like, nearly paralyzed my wife with back pain. I guess the hotel can't be held responsible for this because I'm sure most people like them, but they should have other options for people that don't. We surely won't be buying one of those matresses any time soon.Overall, not a bad hotel, just a bit too much for what you get. I guess you pay a lot for the location, a bit too much in our opinion. We probably would not come back at this price.

<Content>I will return I recently stayed at the Inn at the Market. I absolutely loved it!! I had never stayed in a hotel in Seattle so I did a ton of research. I knew I wanted to stay within walking distance of Pike's Place Market. This place was in the best location. The room was beautiful (we got the Deluxe Water View), the bed was incredibly comfortable. It was beautifully decorated and lots of attention was paid to detail. The staff was great. We will return!!

<Content>Wonderful location, great beds, pretty rooms The Inn at the Market lived up to the positive reviews. As tourists without a car, the location couldn't have been better. There are countless excellent restaurants within easy walking distance. Although it was very rainy, we were able to explore the area and race back to the hotel to warm up when we got too wet or cold (we're from SoCal and have little tolerance for weather). The staff was always friendly, and the view from the deck was glorious even on a dark day. The room was spacious, and the beds extremely comfortable. The hotel made our stay in Seattle great fun even with uncooperative weather.

<Content>Tempur-pedic beds! At the last minute (literally driving past it on way to another hotel) we decided to stay here. It was great! The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating, the room really comfortable and clean, and the location excellent. The atmosphere and location of this hotel made it a great choice (we had previously stayed at the Grand Hyatt which we were returning to). Our room was internal facing (last one left), and was a bit loud, but the tempur-pedic mattress was a huge bonus and fun to try! On our way to the 'hotel restaurant' (which is across the courtyard), the front desk staff suggested we try another one which turned out to be excellent. The view from the deck is great too. I'll stay here again!

<Content>Perfect place to stay The location is absolutely wonderful-right on the Market with a rooftop deck that we brought breakfast up to the first day we were there. We also watched the sunsets over the bay from the deck. The rooms were very nice, and we had no problem with noise from the very busy street below. Service was good and we walked to everthing in downtown Seattle without any problems. Service was good. One warning-valet parking is $25/night-not a huge surprise to those who travel to major cities but could be a jolt to a first time visitor.

<Content>Give Inn to the Market!! We ended back-to-back cruise vacations with an overnight stay at Inn at the Market. Although we had access to the Inn's sedan service (there are certain caveats that exist around that service attribute), we chose the quick cab from the cruise ship terminal to the Inn. My partner was having mobility problems and we advised the hotel in advance that we might be an early check-in. When we did check-in, the front desk rearranged our full waterview suite to a room that was close to being refreshed. We were able to get to our suite 608 with ease. The view was breathtaking with a grand view of the bustling marketplace and waterfront, the room well appointed and Gilcrest and Soame bathroom amenities were most welcome. It's always a good sign when there is little need to leave the comfort of a suite the first evening. At dusk we mingled with several other guests on the terrace, which lent itself to a nice little wind down to our vacation. The bed was extremely comfortable and made for a great night's rest. At checkout in the morning, one of the desk clerks who met us temporarily the previous day recalled both our names. We thouroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, but it must absolutely be the waterfront view. It currently is our favorite accomodation experience.

<Content>Great Hotel; Perfect Location This is a beautiful little hotel in an absolutely fantastic location. The hotel is right in the thick of Pike's Place Market and is also central to other interesting spots and sights across the city. Service was top notch--everyone on the staff was friendly and went out of their way to provide assistance. It can get noisy at night, so I recommend requesting a higher floor room. We did not have a water view room, but there is a deck available to all customers that provides stunning views of the bay and the surrounding areas. All things considered, I would not stay anywhere else in Seattle. The Fairmont might be more luxurious, but the location and atmosphere of the Inn at the Market (which is plenty luxurious) more than compensates.

<Content>Great Location, but get a Water View room The hotel is nice, one of the best things it has going for it is the LOCATION. You are literally AT the Pike Place Market - well, just a 1/4 block walk from the hotel entrance. The staff is very accomodating, VERY friendly, greet everyone with a smile as soon as you enter. The room we had booked was a city view. I am not one to read reviews that say even though we booked a city view room, they automatically upgraded us to a water view and expect to get that treatment too (especially when it is $100+ a night extra!). Yes, we had booked the reservation 6 months in advance, but that doesn't mean anything either right?! I can say if you book a city view room, you WILL hear street noise most of the night - buses, car horns, people yelling from leaving nearby clubs, etc. The room was clean, the bathroom good size, well-stocked with towels, amenities, and the furniture in the room was heavy/good quality. The hotel is very convenient to many downtown areas, and shopping centers are in easy walking distance. The hotel arranged a Town-Car pickup to and from SEA-TAC airport, which was very convenient, professional, and reasonably-priced. For fun outside of downtown, hop on a Metro bus - for $1.25 (the bus fare outside of the Downtown Free area) go to the Seattle Museum of Flight and see the old Air Force One and also a Concorde jet on display!

<Content>Disappointing My husband and I were looking forward to staying at a different hotel - especially this one. We expected a lot - and were so terribly disappointed.At this price point, the details you would expect are non existent. Requests went disregarded - newspapers, extra pillows. Water view that was promised didn't happen. Housekeeping slow and managed to lose a shirt (later returned), and bed linens came complete with holes throughout (were changed upon request). Our room was ok, but in desparate need of a paint job and carpet cleaning. The valet staff however was great - nice, friendly and helpful.We won't be back. The Inn's location is great, but nothing else was memorable. We'll go back to the Edgewater in the future.

<Content>A wonderful Seattle hotel experience This was our second stay at the Inn and it was excellent both times. We were fortunate to have one of the rooms with its own rooftop deck (708) which added to the wonderful stay. Service varies from neutral to very friendly, the common areas and rooms are very clean, well-maintained and near luxury in furnishings. The location right near the Pike Place Market was perfect for us. It provided easy access through walking or brief cab rides to most primary sites. Getting to and from Safeco field for baseball games is somewhat difficult by cab but this is due to the poor access planning by the city not proximity to the hotel. There are excellent restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.This is a first class hotel which would be difficult to beat unless full-service luxury was what you wanted. The only complaint is that the rooms are not soundproof and the air-conditioning is somewhat noisy though very effective. These sound issues did not detract from our experience and we wouldn't book a room at any other hotel upon returning to the great city of Seattle.

<Content>Worth every penny if you have the best rooms Three lovely nights there, the first two in a huge room. They had not promised a full water view, but we got one and hardly wanted to ever leave, since the waterfront was right below us, with ferries and ships coming in and out -- we even ate in our room one night, just to see the sunset, with the Olympic Range coming into view as the sun went down.It's very expensive by Seattle standards, but worth every penny if you have a room on the 8th or 7th floor looking over the water. In fact, two 7th floor rooms share a (semi) private deck -- right below our room, so we could see how much people enjoyed it.The attached restaurant is very good, too, but I wouldn't choose room service again -- the hotel bell staff delivers the meals and they are not as hot as they would be if the restaurant staff grabbed the meal just when it was ready (as they do at the Heathman, in Portland). The restaurant has an outstanding wine list, and there is also a cafe, one floor downhill, that looked like it had an excellent menu of country French food.The service was excellent throughout and the location can't be beat, with Pike Place just a block away. I do not reccomend the breakfasts, but since the small coffee bar that prepares them is apparently going to leave, things may be better in the future.And I don't think, except for location, the Inn would be quite worth the money if you didn't have a room with a good view. It would be comfortable but there are other hotels not too far away. It's one of the places where you want to spring for the very best the hotel can offer.

<Content>Loved the Inn We stayed at the Inn at the Market from 7/11/05 thru 7/18/05. The location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing and getting around Seattle without a car (you don't want to drive in Seattle). Pikes Market is across the street, the waterfront within steps, the Monorail to the Space Needle a short walk, and plenty of great places to eat within a short walk or cab ride. The service and conceirge staff at the Inn were terrific. Very helpful in recommending and arranging sightseeing excursions (Mt. Ranier, whale watching, vineyard tours,etc.). A complimentary town car is available for trips within the downtown area. This was a great help with dinner reservations. The rooms were immaculate. Twice a day room service included turn down in the evening with fresh towels. The decor of the rooms was modern and elegant. Don't miss the roof top garden area for a great view of Puget Sound. This was a great place to unwind at the end of the day with a bottle of wine. I would definetly return to the Inn.

<Content>Best hotel experience in a long time! I visited the Inn at the Market for 3 nights on a business trip. Let's start with the Front Desk Staff; They were always helpful and personable...no attitude. They greeted every guest as soon as they walked in...great job!The room was great! It had everything I needed including wireless internet, which worked perfectly. I worked while watching the ferry boats go in and out of port.....very calming. The mattress was amazing, I wanted to walk out of the hotel with it but couldn't figure out how to get it out of the revolving door without anyone noticing. It was Tempur-Pedic...I know because I wrote it down. It was the most comfortable mattress I've ever been on. I woke up very early and walked right across the street to Pike Place Market to get breakfast and smell the fresh flowers that are set up each morning at around 8am. Everything about this place was truly what a hotel should be. I hope you enjoy it.

<Content>Worth the Money for the Location We recently stayed at the Inn at The Market - returning after having stayed there in 1999. It is still the best location in seattle - particularly if you are there for shopping! The hotel is nice - the rooms are nicely furnished - but are not take your breath away rooms. Views are risky - but who goes to Seattle to sit in their room and watch the world go by??? The beds are tempurpedic and are incredible - you can count on a great night's sleep. As it was back in 1999, the staff are excellent. We had requested a room on the same floor as the terrace - and they met that request pleasantly. Too few guests take advantage of the terrace. For a nice evening go to one of the shops on Pine street, purchase a nice bottle of Washington State wine and some snacks and head back to the terrace to watch the ships leave and the sunset. Very relaxing and romantic. The staff will assist with wine glasses, etc. if needed.

<Content>Wouldn't mind moving in I stayed at the Inn at the Market on May 20th. It was a treat for me. I just wanted to pamper myself a bit. It was to be a me only evening but when I saw the room I called up my boyfriend and suggested we reschedule our 'alone night'. The room, (the parlor suite) was just too awesome to not share with another person. I think it approached my 1bedroom apt. in size.  There were 2 tvs, 1 gigantic bed w/ a tempurpedic mattress, a couch, 2 nice chairs and the most fabulous chaise lounge. The lounge chair was positioned right in front of the huge picture window, and the view was amazing! I grabbed all the feather pillows from the bed and just ensconsed myself on the chair for the longest time, seriously, that view is better than a tv.  I really like the bathroom, it was large and sparkling clean with (except for a 2 person jacuzzi) the nicest tub I've ever been in. It had a comfortable slanted back and filled up really deep. It was a really great tub. I did find a white powder in the bottom of it before I filled it up, however the powder wasn't visible to the naked eye, so I don't really blame housekeeping, I just always check the bath before I fill it up. I appreciated that there was a lot of room in the refridgerator for things that I might want to put in there, while still having juices and sodas available for purchase (at a much more reasonable price than a lot of other places). They also had tasty nuts and candies for sale in the room that were a decent price and unusual. I don't know about anyone else but I get really tired of chain hotels trying to charge ridiculous prices for average products, it's annoying and I'm really glad this hotel wasn't like that. I had an excellent meal from room service, (the dinners are from Campagne which is a very nice French restaurant, I'm not sure where the breakfast is from, but I didn't have it). I had had a negative experience with Campagne about 12 years ago so I didn't really want to order from them but I did. I was so glad too! Nearly a month later and that dinner is still haunting me it was sooooo good!!!! I had halibut (which I don't normally even like) with a tomato coulis and frites. Those two weren't paired together on the menu but it's what I wanted. Had the creme brulee trio for dessert which was also quite good. I enjoyed the balcony, I wasn't there for much of the daytime but it would be a pleasant place to eat lunch. It was a very nice place for me to smoke at night (since there was nobody else around). This is the hotel I would reserve for a treasured out of town guest. It's exceptionally well located, nice staff, feels homey and that view can't be beat. BTW I didn't find it loud at all and I'm quite sure I slept with the windows open. It is pricey but if you can afford it than that won't bother you.

<Content>This is the Best I recently stayed at the Inn at the market and it was outstanding. The service was perfect, the best I have ever encountered. I travel in some of the finest hotels in Europe and this beats them all. They always welcomed me when I came in and made sure I had everything I needed to have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The rooms were so comfortable I did not want to leave. Our room overlooked Elliott Bay and each morning I would watch the ferry boats from the view of window. This was a treat because the weather was unusually perfect.I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Seattle.

<Content>Wonderful!!! Contrary to what some of the other reviews have indicated, this is a wonderful little hotel. We live in the Seattle area and stayed at this hotel last night to try their Tempur-pedic beds (in all rooms). Wow! At least as wonderful as the beds were the staff members. We travel extensively and I told my husband that I think this was the most friendly staff we have ever encountered.You enter the hotel from a tiny little courtyard surrounded by shops and a couple of restaurants. A bit of tranquility amidst the busy Pike Place Market. The original Starbucks is right around the corner close to a wonderful bakery. Buy your breakfast goodies and return to the Fifth floor sun deck at the hotel. There you can sit, relax, munch on your breakfast while enjoying a full unobstructed view of the harbor. Can't get much better than that. Everything you want to see from Pike Place Market to the waterfront to the major downtown shopping areas and theaters are within walking distance from the hotel.The rooms are decorated very tastefully and are immaculate. Not one bit of grunge in the bathroom tile! I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Be careful - water views We had planned a special get away for a number of couples and worked in advance to enusure the multiple rooms we booked had attractive water views. When we got there, 3/4 of the view was of the blank brick wall of the adjoinging building but they still considered and charged as a water view. When we requested something with a truely water view we were told thats all they had - take it or leave it. Disappointing service and attention - we would have strongly preferred accurate representations of what to expect even if it meant higher room rates. Buyer Beware!

<Content>Wonderful, warm and convenient place to stay I stayed five nights and the service was superb, the room comfortable and well kept and the staff (from reception to housemaids to repair staff) were courteous, prompt and friendly. I dropped in a TV remote to the front desk because the batteries had died and within moments of returning to my room, the mainenance guy was knocking on the door with a new one. Advice on places to dine/see in our spare time was impeccable. [BTW, the food's sensational in Seattle, try the Cafe Compagne adjacent to hotel for something really special.] Given I'd travelled half way around the world to attend a conference and meetings, my stay in Seattle was made even more special. I shall remember it always.

<Content>Save your money and stay at Inn at Harbor Steps I just returned 2 days ago from staying here. It was not a special place to stay. We were not treated as special guests. It was very loud and you constantly heard the sound of trucks and honking. The room was pretty, but no breakfast. No wine and cheese hour. Only coffee in the morning. I would stay at Inn at Harbor Steps where you get so much more for your money.

<Content>Loved the Inn My husband and I wanted a romantic get away for one night. The Inn is perfect, they met every detail I imagined. The rooms were very clean, quiet, comfortable and the bath robes a very nice touch. The staff very helpful. Location is great, very good restaurants within walking distance, the market is right there which is always fun to visit any time and free bus service is close by to visit the sites around the city. Beware, parking at the hotel is valet and costs $25.00 for the night. We mentioned to the front desk person that we were not made away of the cost and was not mentioned on the web page. I had expected to pay anyway, but they removed the charge. Great customer service. They also have a wonderful deck overlooking Puget Sound. I would recommend the Inn for anyone who is planning a long visit or just a romantic get away.
