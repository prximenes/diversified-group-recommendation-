<Content>Absolutely Marvelous!!!!!!!!! We stayed at the InterContinental over the Christmas holiday, for 5 nights. What a beautiful resort. We never used the Casino, since we're not gamblers. The pool was gorgeous and really enjoyed the evening swimming. The staff was extremely helpful, and kept the hotel in top shape. We got our room through Hotwire, and we were very pleased about the property. We coudn't have asked for more!!! We did not use any of the hotels restaurants for dining, since we really wanted to experience the local flavor. There is a great restaurant, Mi Casita across the street, that was tasty and well priced. We rented a jeep and parked across the street for about 16 bucks per night, and had access to a parking area 24 hours a day, the lot is safe, and is alway attended by InterContinental staff. We will defiinitey stay at this location again and again. I wish I were there right now!

<Content>Great hotel and location My husband and I stayed here with our 4 year old son in January. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of lots of stores, other hotels and restaurants. The hotel was covered in amazing Christmas decorations and still smelled of pine. Their sushi restaurant was amazing and our son loved their fish tank as well. Our room was on the 15th floor and was very spacious with a pull out sofa. Our only complaint with the room was that we had a room facing the road and there was lots of road noise and sirens all night. I would upgrade to an ocean front room in the future. The front desk staff and bellmen were all wonderfully attentive and considerate. The beach is great, as is the large pool. Overall we had a great stay and would love to return in the future.

<Content>Fire alarms in the middle of the nights, raw sewage, 22% tax I've stayed many places in San Juan but wanted to try this hotel because it is top rated. (Marriott, esj, and Embassy suites are all wonderful)I booked my husband and I here for the first 4 nights of our honeymoon before we caught a princess cruise to eastern Caribbean. First glance, I loved it, it was gorgeous, friendly staff and nice restaurants. It stopped there: beware of an extra 22% hotel tax they tack onto your bill on that credit card for incidentals I have never had to pay this at any of the other hotels. I pre-paid everything this vacation with priceline, so I was perturbed at this. Beyond that minor aggravation, a fire alarm went off two nights in a row at 1:40 and 3 am. I can understand one night having an accident in the kitchen, but two? Beyond that, the manager of the hotel had no idea that the first night it had gone off, he said, oh, it must have been a floor alarm that someone on your floor tripped. But that he had no information on it and oh well. Im a very light sleeper and being woken from dead sleep to a very loud siren and loud booming voice saying a fire has been detected in the building was not my idea of a nice honeymoon. Ok, beyond these two obstacles, we decided to book an excursion on the island. The concierge was very helpful and we decided to take one (mind you very expensive one) that took us to El Yunque, Luquillo beach, and Bioluminescent bay. I had heard great things about the first and last, but never luquillo. I asked the concierge and he said OH its wonderful, best beach on the island, so we went ahead. The rainforest was nice, but when the van dropped us off at the beach and told us they'd be back in 3 hours, we were a little freaked out. We couldn't see the beach from the parking lot so before the van drove away, the guide told us he'd pick us up at the food shacks a half mile down the road at 6pm. Passing them on the way in, it looked like the worst part of the barrio, so we decided we better stay on the beach as long as possible. The van drove away and we walked towards the beach. As soon as we got 10 steps further (of course the van was long gone by then) we saw homeless people sleeping on the beach which was littered with trash and bugs. A few people were swimming but the water looked a little of a weird color--Im from new jersey and even our beaches didn't look that gross. So of course with every disaster of a honeymoon, the clouds darkened for a storm so we were forced to walk to the barrio food shacks. On the way we noticed a nice large river of raw sewage (yes it was for sure as it smelled like it as well) that flowed right into the beach. (we're talking raw sewage into a beach 0.25 miles from the center of the beach) So in the barrio, we were like sitting ducks, we might as well had a target on us, so we spent the 2.5 hours left in the corner of one of the shacks playing pool and trying to generously tip the people at that food stand in hopes we wouldn't be shot or mugged. Finally we got picked up and were brought to Bioluminescent bay in Fajardo. It was nice, but since it was still storming it was a bit short and they didn't let us swim in the water, just kayaked 40 mins round trip to shake our hands in the water and return to the shore. Afterwards, talking to other people on the island, they said the best place to see Biobay is in Vieques (an island off the eastern coast). I give this background because the concierge at the hotel is the one that put us on this. We asked a few cab drivers that they get for you at the hotel and they all say Luquillo is their favorite beach, but any taxi driver not around that hotel will tell you culebra or some others on the western side or southern part of the island.....suspicious, to us it seemed they were all in coohoots. OK so when we went to check out, we asked the manager about this, and he told us, look it up online, its a wonderful beach! I said I dont care what it said online, we've been there and seen the area, seen the sewage and contamination, and its crazy they keep sending people there. He didn't seem to care, so great if he likes swimming in raw sewage (which is where I'd like to dunk him now), I just advise the rest of you dont. :) So to not ruin your vacation or honeymoon, this is a beautiful hotel, but I'd advise stay in The Embassy Suites (free hot breakfast and free happy 2 hours) or El San Juan and with either you can walk to Ruth's Chris steakhouse or any Intercontinental amenities.

<Content>My Favorite Hotel This hotel is one of the best I have stayed at. I discovered this hotel during 9/11 (where I was forced to stay during the air space clousure) and fell in love iwth it. I have returned at least once a year since then.The service is great. I have never had a problem with staff. They are helpful and go out of their way to meet your needs.The beach is very nice and rivals any in the Carribean. It is clean and safe. I have never been bothered here by beggars, etc. The pool is really cool. Waterfalls, swim up bar, adult area, kid area. What more do you need? The only draw back is if you sleep in, you may not get a chair! My kids and wife love it too.The rooms are clean and very comfortable. Even though it is near the airport, you never hear the planes. Very quiet.If you are looking for a quality hotel in San Juan, this one is worth evey penny.

<Content>Fabulous We (my husband and I and another couple) stayed here one night after our cruise and we all absolutely loved this hotel. I was nervous because I was the one that made the reservations and you know how that can sometimes go! But from the moment we checked in to the moment we left we enjoyed our stay tremendously. When we arrived we were immediately greeted as we got out of the taxi and our bags were taken care of. Check-in was a breeze...although that could have something to do with the fact that there happened to be no one else in line when we arrived! We arrived early and our room wasn't ready which we didn't expect it to be. We were offered a hospitality room (which was one of the hotel rooms) to use to change/freshen up, etc. So we put our suits on and headed right out to the beach for the afternoon. The staff were all friendly. I was pleasantly surprised when we checked out the next morning that the gentleman behind the desk actually remembered my name and greeted me by name. The hotel room itself was great. I didn't find it small at all (could that be because we just came off of a week on a cruise ship???). There was a vanity right outside the bathroom which was perfect for hair and makeup and best of all - the lighting was good for doing your makeup! (Women can relate to this issue!).We didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on that. We did have breakfast in a small diner located in the strip mall across the street - food was good (typical breakfast stuff) and very reasonably priced. The hotel is about a 5 minute ride to the airport and I was surprised that the whole afternoon we spent on the beach (and the next morning) we never heard any planes go by.All in all I highly recommend this hotel and if we go back we'll definitely stay here again.

<Content>Raving Reviews! Loved It! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Intercontinental during our 3 night trip to Puerto Rico Oct. 17th - 20th. We really enjoyed our stay here. It was a quick ride from the airport, costing us about $15 with our luggage, and when we got there, the bell guy who greeted us (Ramon) very warm and friendly. We checked in early and our room was not ready, but they held our bags and encouraged us to walk around and view the facility. The pool area was very nice, and just steps beyond that was the beach. The landscape of the pool area was awesome and the swim up bar was a definite plus. Since we were traveling in the off season, there weren't many people there and so it was easy to get service. All the staff members were extremely friendly, curteous, and professional. I have nothing but the best to say about them. David, the bartender, was the best! He gave us wonderful recommendations for food and was always available with a helping hand. The room was a bit small, but it was functional. The bed was comfortable and we had fresh towels everyday. The only bad thing was the bathtub took so long to drain -- by the end of the shower you'd be standing in 3 of water. The hotel lobby was nice and bright and I enjoyed their casino as well. We won the first night, but gave it all back plus some throughout our stay. I would definitely go back to the intercontinental and would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Que Sabor! What Flavor! Que Sabor! What flavor! From the minute you enter the premises of the Intercontinental San Juan you are surrounded by lush landscaping, friendly bilingual staff, and native salsa music. I was not disappointed. The rates were equal to what you get. The grounds were kept clean. Staff and security were visible 24 hours a day. My husband and I stayed for a week and visited the spa daily. It was empty most days but is complimentary including bottled water, robes, fruit, and a nice dry/wet sauna. The gym overlooks the ocean and has very up to date equipment. I would advise all to eat majority of meals outside of the resort as breakfast alone cost us $45. There is a grocery store along with restaurants offering cheap authentic Puerto Rican cuisine within walking distance. The concierge can get you anywhere you want to go along with available cab service stationed outside the front door of hotel. I plan to go again soon!

<Content>Very nice, but a bit dated We stayed at the Intercontinental for four nights, and had a great time. The hotel was clean and beautiful, although the room decor was a bit dated. The bed was super comfortable, and the pool and beach were clean and well maintained. The staff was very accomodating, but the best part was that they left you alone. I have been to resorts where the pool area staff hovered around you and asked if you needed anything every five minutes, but here they were visible and available, but left you alone for the most part. The beach was clean and not too crowded. The surf was a bit rough and there was a bit of an undertow, but it was fun. Just watch out for the stinging urchins! We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants, but we did get room service and the food was just okay. We got the continental breakfast in the lobby each morning and took it down to the beach, which was great. The coffee in the lobby is so good! Overall, this was not a bad hotel, and I'd stay there again if I ever go back to San Juan. Just be sure to ask for a room overlooking the pool and ocean, since the view on the other side is not so great. Also, be aware that the hotel (and in fact all of the Isla Verde area hotels) are very close to the airport, so you will hear jets taking off and landing all day. If that will bother you, you may want to try Condado or one of the other parts of the island.

<Content>Awesome quick getaway!! My husband and I stayed at the Intercontinental for my birthday and it was just perfect. If you are looking for a relaxing atmosphere without the big crowds (low season), this is the place to go.The hotel has an elegant flair and they try to make it feel as luxurious as possible, don't expect Ritz Carlton level and you will not be dissapointed. The hotel: Same as everyone else says : nice people, slow front desk, helpful when needed and always opening doors. As far as the food at the hotel, we only ate there once and it was good but pricey, $48.00 for lunch that consisted of a burger, a sandwich and two drinks, ouch. Stay away from the drinks at the beach bar, we ended up ordering two $15 drinks that were not even that great or strong or big. Check with the waiter about the prices before you order because they don't list them on the menu.The rooms: Nice and clean, not imaculate but clean. The bed was soft and plushy, super comfortable. We also upgraded to ocean view and it really is worth the money. We were greeted with wine and strawberries for my B-day which is always nice.The beach: We read that the beach in Isla Verde is nothing compared to the not so touristy beaches that PR offers, so we didn't know what to expect. When we finally checked in, ( that took a really long time) we headed to the beach and it was beautiful. Blue, calm and just what we needed. There were maybe 8 other couples on the beach, so it felt very private. It was quiet, and so relaxing. The beach alone is worth the trip.We opted to rent a car, and I would say that if you are planning to do some exploring you have to rent a car. It is very easy to get everywhere and the freedom you get to leave when you want and go whenever and wherever you want to go is awesome. So, unless you are not moving from the hotel, rent a car, it is worth it and cheaper. I definetaly agree with the fact that organized tours are not worth your money. We explored so much, Luquillo beach, the rainforest, Old san juan, Pinones on Sunday when all the locals go (fun and very PR, if you want to sample local food, brace yourself and eat).The only tour I highly recommend is the Vieques Bioluminecent tour. East Island Excursions is the only company that can arrange a night trip and bring you back to Fajardo, which is a 20-30 minute drive from Isla Verde. I will do it again in a heart beat. To read more about it, go to puertoricodaytrips.com. Don't forget to schedule your tour according to the what phase the moon is in. The biobay is best experienced on cloudy, moonless nights. Food: Well, I guess this is the only down side of our trip. We are very adventurous when it comes to food and we were looking forward to trying the local fare. Unfortunately, most of it didn't agree with me, lots of fried and super fried foods. But that is just me. We ate at Mi Casita one night and it was good, we also tried Pamela's for my actual b-day dinner, and even though that was pricey, about $200.00 for two with drinks, it was so yummy.I am definetaly coming back with the kids, the hotel's pool is awesome and beach access steps away. I recommend everyone explore PR, it is really beautiful and so different than your usual Mexico vacation. I look forward to coming back soon.

<Content>A great pre-cruise hotel We stayed at the Intercontinental for 2 nights before our Southern Caribbean cruise. We were met by a wonderful staff, always with a smile and a greeting. The entire staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel itself was beautiful, and our room was spectacular, very clean, with a comfy king size bed. The pool area was great, the pool itself was phenominal with a waterfall and a swim-up bar. The hotel is situated on the beach, which is a short walk from the pool. We had a great time and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The only downfall is the food prices at this hotel. However, there is ample food choices for the bargin hunter just across the street.

<Content>What a fantabulous trip My husband and I spent our anniversary at the intercontinental, what a wonderful time we had. Upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted by some of the nicest hotel staff there is. Check-in was relatively smooth, although our room wasn't ready the bell man had already taken out luggage and placed it in safekeeping. Once we were able to get to our room I couldn't believe how beautiful the room was. We were able to get an ocean view and it was worth every penny it cost. We received complimentary wine and chocolate covered strawberries to celebrate our anniversary. The concierge was very helpful they gave direction for everything within the area. Every type of fast food eatery is within distance of the hotel for example..... Church's chicken, baskin robbins, Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Wendy's and more. Please also try the italian restaurant in the hotel wow how wonderful of a meal they offer. The wine distillery was a bus ride away so there was no need to rent a car. The buses are free from Aug 08-Dec 08 so ride on. We visited the rain forest which is an experience I recommend to every tourist. The pool area was wonderful as well. With regards to shopping you can shop for all the name brands Coach Tommy Hilfiger, Boss, Dooney  Burke, Burberry. This is a trip that I am really glad I took and had a great time without spending a bundle of money.

<Content>Tips fom a 3rd-time Visitor Background: I'm 28yrs old, I have been to San Juan 3 times in the past 2 years - twice at the El San Juan when I was single (next door) and once at the Intercontinental with my girlfriend (this visit).The Hotel: My first impression was that the hotel was very nice. It is centrally located in relation to popular tourist attractions (Old San Juan and El Yunque Rainforest). It is right on a beatiful beach. The lobby is quite small and not much going on. If you are looking for action the El San Juan is right next door. Overall, the pool and the lobby is much nicer at the El San Juan but for a family, couples, a relaxing vacation or elderly people, the Intercontinental is a better choice as it is much quieter and well lit. The El San Juan is very trendy, dark and loud (think night club) - but if you are single and younger (under 35) the El San Juan is a better choice.The Room: I originally upgraded to a room with an ocean view but when I got to my room on the 7th floor I noticed that most of the view was obstructed by trees. I immediately called the front desk and they gladly changed rooms to the 14th floor...that view was SPECTACULAR!!! Moral of the story - make sure you call for a higher floor because ocean view is pretty much anything on the side of the hotel that faces the ocean...it doesn't necessarily mean that you can see the ocean LOL! My only complaint was that the walls were paper-thin and you can easily hear people in the next room and it can be hard to sleep at night if you have loud neighbors. I had to call security all 3 nights I was there - it's not the hotel's fault that these people were really loud but just keep in mind that the walls are thin.The Hotel Staff: The staff is extremely courteous (much more than at the El San Juan). There was always someone to open the doors to the hotel for you no matter what time you entered or exited the hotel (and they never asked or expected a tip). The concierge was very nice and helpful as well. My only complaint was that the service at the front desk was a bit slow. House keeping was very quiet when cleaning other rooms- they were like ninjas - you dind't even know they were there. I left my room for breakfast, put the sign on my door to get my room cleaned...came back 45min later and my entire room was clean.Rental Car / PARKING!!!! : This was the best part for me...right accross the street is a self-parking area...it costs $16 per day and you can go in and out AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE! This is such an advantage if you are doing any sightseeing. DO NOT waste money on organized tours...all the signs in San Juan are in English and easy to follow. Rent a car and you will save yourself a TON on money (including a $15 cab trip each way to and from the airport). I reserved a car from the airport on priceline.com for $15/day tax inc.!!!! That's $93 for a 4-day, 3-night weekend for parking and the car - You can't beat that! Old San Juan and the Bacardi factory are 15min by car and the rainforest is 45min away. If you take an organized tour this will cost you at least a couple of hundred dollars per person...for something that can easily be done on your own! However, make sure you bring a GPS - it will really come in handy - if you don't have one, most rental car companies can offer you one at a marginal rate. RENT A CAR, RENT A CAR, RENT A CAR!!!!Where to eat: Right across from the hotel there are tons of restaurants (Burger King, Pizza Hut, Wendy's, Subway, KFC...). My suggestion would be Mi Casita it is fairly authentic and relatively inexpensive and the food is good...BUT BEWARE the service can be long. I have eaten at this restaurant 5 times, dinner usually takes at least 45min for you to get your food and breakfast is around 25-30min. However, the last day we were there, dinner came out in 15min and breakfast came out in 10min...so I would say it's hit or miss but prepare for the worst. Don't go when you are extremely hungry because chances are you will wait a while. Try their Signature Mofongo dishes (mashed plantain topped with a tomato based sauce and your choice of chicken/beef/shrimp.) Overall, the wait is worth it - both for the quality of the food and especially the price.  If you eat at any of the hotels, don't expect to get out of there for under $100 for 2 people (wine not included). Another option, is there is a grocery store within 5min walking distance from the hotel - you can't see it, so ask the concierge how to get to the Pueblo grocery store. There you can buy water, drinks, and even prepared food for dirt cheap prices. Also, there is a Walgreens 5min walking distance as well. Beach: The beach is very nice but can be crowded in peak seasons. It is a long beach - I'd say at least 5 miles. The sand is groomed every morning. The water can get rough if there is bad weather but generally, it is really good. The good thing about this hotel is that the beach chairs are free. Some other hotels charge $4/day for beach chairs!Things to do: If you like booze, the Bacardi Factory is nearby, you can go on a tour once you get there with your rental car =) Old San Juan is beautiful - make sure to bring a camera. There are a few old forts that can be visted that will give you a great view of the ocean and the city as well as a history of the island. Also, there is a path that you can walk on right by the ocean that takes you all along Old San Juan.El Yunque rainforest: This is a must! Take your rental car and drive to the rainforest; there are many well marked trails that are paved. You do not need a guide or to go on a tour. If you go by yourself - it's FREE!!!! All you have to do is print out a trail map from the internet first. On my first trip in 2005, I went on a tour that cost me $60...we walked for an hour and we were done. This time I did some research and did the La Mina trail and the Big Tree trail and that was amazing - nothing like what the tours take you on...breath-taking scenery and a gorgeous waterfall at the bottom. The rainforest opens at 7:30am; if you start hiking before 8:30am you will be fine otherwise expect crowds, especially at La Mina Falls. Both trails I took were about 40min of hiking...the La Mina trail is MUCH nicer than the Big Tree trail but it is also a bit harder to do. If you are in any decent shape, I suggest the La Mina trail down to the falls and the Big Tree trail back up. I hope this helps you out, I really love Puerto Rico and it is clear why it is called La Isla Del Encanto. I am set to go back in May and visit Culebra, home to Flamenco Beach - rated by Discovery Channel as one of the nicest beaches in the world.

<Content>Breathe - Taking The hotel was steps from the beach. It is locate along the hotel strip 5 mins from the airport. A girlfriend and I stayed here for her birthday and she loved it. We were upgraded to an oceanview room without even asking for it. There are plenty restaurants within the hotel but we did not eat at any of them. There are restaurants along the strip and you have your american chains (Burger King, Church's, Wendy's, etc) I could have not asked for a better hotel. The grounds were well maintained, the staff was always helpful, and I love the huge swimming pool. What you are not told is that there is a hotel fee of $10 a day, but they hold a $100 a day on your credit card. I don't have one bad thing to say about this hotel.

<Content>Mom, Hubby, Kids all loved it! We took my mom here for her 65th birthday knowing she loved PR. Well, it was a GREAT trip- except for the rain the last few days. We were there from Oct.9-13 and even though the hotel was full, it never felt that way. Everyone loved the resort, hubby-hard to please, mom-harder to please :-) and our 2 little girls- 5 and 6. Our 14 year old was a bit bored due to the fact that there weren't many teenagers for her to hang with. Wonder if they have a kids program during peak season? They did show family movies every day at 5:00 p.m. The pool was beautiful, the staff amazingly friendly, beach clean and lovely. I do prefer the Caribbean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean but Intercontinental can't do anything about that. LOL The casino was fun- as mentioned, free food and drinks while gambling. Old San Juan was great shopping and beautiful. Will definitely be back, but beware as hotels everywhere, the food and drink prices were high. Mix BK, Subway,Mi Casita with hotel food and have a WONDERFUL time. We did.

<Content>better than expected We went in the off season and paid less than $2000 for airfare and three nights at hotel for four of us.. We have a 3 and 5 year old who loved it. The pool is fantastic with waterfalls, swim up bars, and even a shallow platform for the kids to play on. The beach is steps away and there is an outdoor restaraunt so you never have to go in. There are some good places to eat at the hotel but we found that if you want authentic puerto rican food all you have to do is go across the street to Mia Casita, fantastic food and very inexpensive. We took the public bus to Old SanJuan and the fort. Took us an hour to get there. On the way back we took a taxi for $20 and it took 10 minutes, worth it! At night there is always music in the lobby and the casino is small but very adequate. Complimentary sandwiches and beverages at gaming areas. We will be going back and recommended it to all traveling types.

<Content>Loved it again. This was my 2nd stay at the Intercontinental San Juan. Once again, it was very clean and very nice. We reserved a suite, which has a separate living room, tv and fridge. There was another fridge and tv in the bedroom. The staff was nice and helpful. I liked the location. Isla Verde is a public beach, and very clean for a public beach. Great diner across the street, very convenient. Love the fact that it was literally 5 mins from the airport. Great for a quick get away. Just a very easy, convenient trip and the beach is beautiful. One silly thing that disappointed me was the fact that complimentary bottles of water were available at the towel desk during our last visit but not during this visit. The pool is nice but a bit small. The pool area is beautiful. Very lush, and nice landscaping - makes you feel like you are in your vey own oasis, which is how one should feel while on vacation.

<Content>Nice Stay- Probably wouldnt return My husband and I stayed at the Intercontinental for 7 days, Sept. 17-23 for our anniversary. We didnt have to wait too long to check in and we upgraded to a ocean front room for $150 extra. Here is my honest review: When I saw our ocean front room I was shocked by how much they charge regular price for it. There were tons of ants in the bathroom. I had to call housekeeping a couple of times to spray the bathroom. There was mold everywhere. Rooms are dingy. Old carpets. Old furniture. I would never pay full price for this room. The actual hotel grounds were ok. Pool was clean. The Beach was AMAZING. The water was perfect and the sand clean, hardly any rocks. We really got to relax. I must also point out that we visited during Peak Hurricane Season so there were hardly any people staying at the hotel. Next to the pool, there must have been 10 people the entire week. If your'e going during high season, the pool area is pretty small and I can see it crowding really easily. The food at the hotel was BLAH. You're better off going across the street to Mi Casita for breakfast (will cost you $15.00 rather than $50.00 at the hotel). Dinners are VERY expensive. We spent an average of $140 every night just for dinner. Lunch runs about $45.00 for two people - and we dont eat a lot. So food is extremely pricey unless you want to eat fried fast food for the week. Wendy's Burger King, KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, all across the street. We ate mostly at the El San Juan Hotel. That hotel looked absolutely beautiful. Food was amazing at Koco, The Palm and Yamato. If I was to go back to San Juan, I would probably try staying at the El San Juan. It was way more modern than the Intercontinental. Overall, unless you are getting a GREAT deal at this hotel, I would recommend choosing another one. They really need to fully clean and maintain their rooms, not just their outside property.

<Content>The Intercontinental Rocks! We had a room overlooking the beach. Upon arrival, there was a piece of chocolate cake in our room because my birthday would occur during our stay. The first night we walked on the beach right off the hotel and watched a beautiful sunset. Every day we swam up to the bar IN THE POOL and had drinks (cappuccino colada!!!) and the best chicken quesadillas! One day I hung my bathing suit on the balcony to dry, and a gust of wind made it fall below to a rooftop ten floors below our room. My fiance (well, back then he was a mere boyfriend but we since got engaged!!!) went down to the concierge to ask for help, and minutes later a maintanance worker was sent to rescue my bathing suit and he promptly brought it to our room. Another time I left my watch near the pool to go for a swim, and one of the pool boys must have thought I left it there and took it to the lost and found. When we inquired about the watch, they were very helpful and the concierge even made me prove that the watch was mine before he handed it back to me.At the hotel's recommendation, we celebrated my birthday at Pamela's, a beautiful restaurant right on the beach. It was so romantic and delicious. We loved the Intercontinental and would recommend it to anyone who likes to swim up to their bar and hang their bathing suits to dry on the balcony. We'll be back!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I just returned from Puerto Rico where I stayed at the InterContinental Hotel  Resort; we were there from 09/10/08 to 09/15/08. The hotel and staff are wonderful. Upon our arrival from the airport (which is literally a 7 minute drive), Jose checked us in. We'd originally reserved and paid for a regular room. I asked Jose about upgrading and he offered us a suite on the 16th floor (top) for an excellent price. The suite was #1600 and was nicely laid out and very roomy. It included an average size bedroom that opened to very spacious living and dining rooms. The suite had 2 full baths (both could stand to be a little larger). They were both nicely decorate with marble. There was a small kitchen area off of the living room that had a small sink and a mini-refrigerator but no microwave which was a little disappointing (there's certainly enough counter and cabinet space for one). The suite had 3 balconies that provided a beautiful ocean view. The balconies are only large enough to stand but were realy nice to have. We didn't do much in terms of sight seeing. We went to Old San Juan one day to visit the Forts which was nice. We were given great advice about how to get there and what to do from Nestor at the concierge desk. He was very knowledge and took the time to explain everything. We ate at Ruth's Chris ( which is right in the hotel) one night which we love and do on a regular basis when we're home. It was good and although pricey it was comparable to what we normally pay. We made reservations for the Japanese restaurant but didn't go because we'd had a late lunch and were not hungry. We went to Mi Casita (which is right across the street) for breakfast a couple of days and for dinner one night. The breakfasts were good and cheap and the seafood paella was wonderful and inexpensive as well. There are a number of other places to eat accross the street (Burger King, Church's Chicken, Baskin Robbins, a taco place) and a supermarket that wasn't very well stocked but did have beer and water. We spent a great deal of time in the casino and on the beach. The casino at the InterContinental was OK; however, we preferred the one up the street at the El San Juan hotel. The beach was OK, nothing tropical or beautiful. It certainly doesn't compare to the beaches in other parts of the Caribbean; it's more like a city beach; nothing special or breathtaking. All-in-all, our trip to Puerto Rico was OK. It was nice to get away to a place that I'd never been before but it certainly didn't satisfy to desire to be on a beatuiful tropical island and beach.

<Content>3 stars at best. We had problems, but management did come through for us. I stayed at the IC San Juan in early September. I love Puerto Rico (this was my 5th hotel stay in PR in a year and a half) and was thrilled to bring along a friend who hadn鈥檛 been before. We chose the IC because we found a really great deal online. I had been in a lobby a few times and it seemed nice. I wasn't scared away by a few negative reviews on Tripadvisor, but perhaps I should I have been.We encountered cleanliness issues in our room, and service issues in general. To give some specifics, we encountered a dirty carpet full of dust bunnies under the furniture, hair left in the shower, mold in the bathroom, half-hearted daily housekeeping, and a soiled bathrobe. Room service screwed up in several ways (waking me up before 7 am to verify my order which I placed the night before, then getting the order wrong anyway, and serving it cold). Waiters at the pool literally never came by, though we did see them, so we would eventually give up and get our own food and drinks. It was frustrating, but Irene, the club manager, did set things right for us, comping the room service and adding a few other nice touches. So, while we encountered annoyances, all鈥檚 forgiven. She was extremely professional. Like most nearby resorts, they nickel and dime you; prepare to pay for everything. The best bet is to stock up on water, sunscreen, and snacks at the Walgreens right down the street. The gift shop has cheaper water than the bottles in the room if you need it. (FYI, there's no complimentary water in the gym except the old-fashioned communal water fountain; they will sell you a Gatorade for $3.)On the plus side, the hotel has a nice location on the beach, a good pool, a swim-up bar with great bartenders, and a decent gym. The waiter on the beach (not poolside) did come around often enough. The gentleman who sets up chairs and umbrellas on the beach, Jose, was very friendly.Because management took the time to hear my concerns and fix the problems, I can鈥檛 give this place a less than three stars, though it's really more like a 2.5 out of 5. I wish I didn鈥檛 have to take time out of my stay to complain, which I don鈥檛 like to do. I think part of the problem may have been that it was a generally slow season but a busier holiday weekend, thus they may have had more people than the staff could handle. I also feel like the IC is an upscale chain, but this particular IC is not like other Intercontinentals. This IC thinks it鈥檚 a 4-star hotel but operates more like a 3-star. A better choice in the same price range is the Courtyard Marriot Isla Verde, which is not as fancy a hotel (no high end steakhouse, no opulent lobby) but absolutely excels in its class and has great service and better food. As for Ruth's Chris, I have now eaten there twice and am not impressed at all. You can get less awkward service and similar quality cooking at the Outback, but if you want to splurge, go the BLT Steak . I've probably eaten there at least 10 times and each time it's perfect.

<Content>Beautifull Property - Terrible Service This resort leaves a lot to be desired. The place is very, very old. The lobby and public areas have been somewhat re-done. But not to the standards of Intercontinental property's in the US. Check in was a breeze, courteous, and very efficient. Except that I was charged an additional resort tax and fees that where never mentioned when I booked my reservation. A resort fee at a resort that charges a fortune for water in your room, charges for everything. So not sure what the resort fee is for.My room was dated, worn, and torn. The furniture was very old rattan and wood. The french door with mirrors for the bathroom was very 1980. The A/C was loud and did not cool to well. Carpets where frayed, stained and torn. Not the room that you would expect at an Intercontinental Hotel. It was actually a Jr. Suite with a separate bedroom and living room. Old style box televisions and no mini-bar, no robes, no upgraded amenities. I faces the lagoon. My friend had a room facing the ocean (#820). Those rooms have plasma TV;s and upgraded furniture and bedding. But the rooms (mine was #821) with odd numbers that face the lagoon are old school. Make sure u make it clear ar check in that you want one of the newer rooms.Turndown service is a joke. Its not included automatically. You have to request it. All the do is come in and close curtains. That's it. No chocolate, no refreshing of room. no extra towels. Nothing. Why even offer turndown service if they are not going to do it the right way ?Pool area is absolutely amazing. What a nice pool and bar area. I really enjoyed that part of my stay. Except that the hotel has this crazy policy about (1) single pool towel per guest. You have to sign for it, get a bracelet, the whole thing is in convenient and more Cancun all inclusive $79 a night hotel then 5 star resort. I mean at almost $400 a night on average here. You expect a certain level of service.The chaise lounges have comfy blue cushions on them. But they are all dirty, old, mildewy . and stained. You need (1) towel to cover them and then (1) towel for yourself. There are no bar attendants that come to you. You have to go to bar yourself and get your orders in. Drinks are expensive and taste terrible. Spa was ok. I had a massage with a male therapist. He was good. But they cheated me out of 5 min of my service. He finished earlier. This is not honest and not right. I was upset. But they did not seem to care. The girl at the desk did give me a 5% off for my inconvenience. But an apology would of been better then 5% off. The spa has a relaxation area with bottles of water and tea. But there is no sugar for the tea, no honey, and nothing to stir the tea with. When I asked or honey or sugar. I was told they had none ???Breakfast at Alfredo's is cheap at only $22. When you consider the variety and quality of the food. Its a good deal and the selection is fantastic. I did the buffet every morning and highly recommend it. But the service from the wait staff was mediocre at best. They where slow and no responsive to guest needs.At check out. I had an early flight. I tried to check out the night before. I was told at 12AM that I could not do that because system was in audit to do it in the morning, I tried at 5AM to check out. Again was told that they would charge all to my Credit Card on file. They could not take my cash because they where in Audit. I waited until 5:30AM and almost missed my flight. I had to leave there without being able to pay in cash and they charged my Credit Card. This is not fair as I intended to pay in cash. If this where like any other Intercontinental in the US. This would of never happened. Hotel is in a great location and right on the ocean. If you get a good deal on hotwire or priceline then I guess its ok. But DO NOT pay the rates on intecontinental.com. You will be sorry !!!

<Content>Just Fantastic I stayed in this hotel for one night of a 7night stay in Puerto Rico for my Anniversary. I can tell you it was amazing!!! I loved this hotel and the staff was extremely friendly and the resort was beautiful and elegant. They upgraded me to a ocean view and I have been to a few hotel resorts in Puerto Rico and my recommendations is this one hands down so far. I also reccomend Embassy Suites, Condado Plaza and Radison as a lower classs than most others but fairly good. I loved the Intercontiental it was gourgeous and my best hotel stay ever in Puerto Rico. I can tell you they are friendly, want to ensure you have a pleasant stay and ensure you get the quality you come to expect from a hotel with their star level.

<Content>2.5 stars Masqerading as a 4 Not a 4 star in my book, but of course this is always subjective to the travelers expectations and perhaps mine were just too high. I recently stayed at Intercontinental San Juan Resort and was thoroughly disappointed. We were not told when you book the room that they will charge a hold on your credit card of $100.00 per night for incidential fee for each day that you stay. The pool chair cushions had numerous stains  bird feces. The streets needed repairs, there were abandon buildings in the area, your local homeless people  only one authentic Puerto Rician restaurant in the area. Overall, the hotel and staff was nice and the room was just okay..nothing spectacular. The beach, due to storms and inclimate weather conditions had massive seaweed and ocean debris and look extremely unpleasing to swim in. Pretty scenery, but way too much seaweed. I did not appreciate the hotel adding a 15% gratuity to every purchase that was made to my bill without my consent and or initial knowledge. The pool consistently had leaves from the overhead trees in it  were not cleaned out to my knowledge hourly. The pool area did not have any music  there was minimal night life in the existing area. The communication between staff members was appalling  non existent. The cab rides/fares fluxuated $2-4 per every ride to same destinations. the cabbies are supposed to work in zones, but we discovered that some drivers are dishonest to tourists because they don't think they know any better. I found this part to be very frustrating. On the hotel premises you are not allowed to bring outside food to their pool area only out to the public beach are you able to eat outside food. They want you to eat and drink from their restaurants on site. the water in our room had turned luke warm for about an hour and the water pressure in the shower was terrible. All the food is very pricey. Everyday we had to call the front desk to have them send up towels and washclothes. I am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with my hotel stay and will not be a Hotwire consumer due to this negative hotel experience.

<Content>Great stay!! When we went to check-in, the very nice desk clerk upgraded my husband  I to an ocean view room due to low occupancy (low season in P.R.). The room itself was lovely and very clean (the view was gorgeous!). Every staff member we encountered was very helpful and polite. Several restaurants are located within the Intercontinental but we did not try them due to lack of time. The small bar downstairs is adequate for drinks  the casino is nice if you like to gamble. The bar food is laughably overpriced and if you are remotely adventurous, hoof it to the Taco Bell for some late night food (about 2 blocks down on Isla Verde Avenue). There are also two Walgreens on Isla Verde Avenue, so you can easily pick up water etc. on your trip. If you drive, the parking lot is across the street for $16 dollars a day. Make sure you ask the desk clerk for the paper pass to put in your car.

<Content>It was great! My fiancee and I spent our first vacation in a city view room at the Intercontinental. I have no serious complaints! The first night I got there, I didn't really like the area, as there are a FEW abandoned businesses around. By the second night, the area had intoxicated me! It's so charming, clean (you could go barefoot) and everyone is so pleasant. ***Hotel PROS  CONS***I can't even think of any serious complaints. The restaurants were pricey? But the food was delish. We booked trips through the hotel, they cleaned our room as long as we left the sign on the door, the AC was comfortable, there was a mini-fridge, cofeemaker...Ok, yeah the TV sucked but we weren't really on vacation to watch TV! Balcony was small, but we weren/t on vacation to stay on our balcony either.***Beach PROS CONS***PROS:-not a ton of annoying noisy kids around, but there are more at the pool-water is turquoise(but not crystal clear)-water is calm-parasailing and jet skis activities availableCONS:-some may be annoyed by the airplanes (I only noticed them 2 or 3x during our 4 day stay, and we spent hoursssssss on the beach[and I am sensitive to noise)Restaurants we went to:Mi Casita: is right across the street and the food was DELICOUS, even though the service was a little slow. A meal there will run you about $30-$50Platos: A little more pricey. They serve a Paella that can feed at least SIX grown men for $45. I think it's a recurrign theme for relaxed Islands like PR- the service was a little slow.Lupis: DISGUSTING! The meal came out to just over $50, yet made Taco Bell look like a freaken' gourmet restaurant. Def. a tourist trap.For daytime fun: We booked a day catamaran trip through our hotel for $88? per person. Pros: (for day trip)-Our first stop was at Icacos, an AMAZING deserted island whose waters were crystal clear. Seriously, you could see like every grain of sand on the ocean floor-Yummy food-Energetic staffCons: -Catamaran shelter leaked when it started raining-we didnt' spend nearly enough time at Icacos, but spent more time on Culebra (?) whose waters had more interesting fish but murkier water-Catamaran bathroom was nasty, no airfreshner, and sinks with no running water.The area had a Walgreens which was 4 minutes away. Whatever we ran out of or needed, was a 4 minute walk away at Walgreens If you want to save money, get some $3 coolers from there and get some water and cold cuts. You can get the same souveniers they sell in the souvenir shops for less than half the price.Next time we may rent a car so we can explore a bit more, but there are so many amazing things to do in that area.

<Content>We had a good trip .. We stayed at the Intercontinental for 5 nights and we really did not have any problems. I know there are some awful reviews on here, but we had a mostly good experience. Hotel: We were given a room when we arrived and there was no waiting. It was next to the elevator and we asked to be moved, which we were immediately and the receptionist was really nice about it. We were moved to a bigger room with a couch and table, large fridge and comfy bed. It was clean! And the maid service was great - we always had clean towels. We also had no problems with the elevators being slow, never once did we have to wait long for one. One morning there was some banging when something was being fixed, but it didnt start until 9.30 am and wasn't a problem. Your not going to PR to hang out in your room! Ours faced the street which was also quite nice, you get a view of the city. Restaurants: The food at the hotel is great - yes it is a bit pricey but if you're looking for a budget holiday you should stay elsewhere. All the restaurants in the hotel were very good, as was the poolside bar and grill. Drinks are the same price as any hotel on a beach ($10 - 12) - and they tasted good! There is the strip of shops across the road, but the food was so so. Theres a subway and several fast food places. Mi casita and Gelo were ok for breakfast, but a warning, you end up smelling of the grill if you go to these places, it is very strong, so dont wear your best outfits there. The coffee ar Mi casita was probably the worst cup I have ever had - just to warn you. PR coffee is amazing but try it elsewhere. We also tried outback steakhouse down the road and it was below par, not up to the usual standards. Ruth Chris's in the hotel is very very good, my favorite. Alfredos is also good - the breakfast buffet was very nice ($22 each). Beach and Pool: This is what you go to San Juan for!! The beach was beautiful and clean - as was the pool. Lovely blue water. A fantastic place to relax. There are always loads of chairs to choose from, never full. And plenty of unbrellas. If they start packing up the beach at 5.30 pm you can just move over to the pool, its 5 feet away. You get wrist bands too and security seemed very good. You can hire an umbrella on the beach for $5 and a guy sets it up for you. The sun is very strong so wear sunblock! There's a walgreens up the street with everything you need and we got drinks and snacks here too. We had 5 minutes of rain for the whole week - weather was fantastic. Surounding area: The area around the hotels is a bit sad and run down. It is NOT a resort outside the hotel, so if you are looking for that, I suggest you stay elsewhere. Old San Juan is lovely, really worth the trip and we ate at Barrachina which was wonderful. The sangria and pina coladas were so so good. There are lots of cute stores and beautiful buldings. Cab costs $21 to get there. It was very hot in San Juan, so we went later in the day and it was better. Many stores close at 5.30pm but the restaurants are open much later. This hotel is near the airport - so you see and hear some planes. It did not bother us at all and was not loud. Again if this bothers you - stay on another part of the island. Cab from the airport is $14.Casinos: This is not vegas, nor should it be. There are slots and tables, plenty in each hotel if you want to gamble a bit. The machines are on the older side, but it was fun. The hotel next door - El san Juan has a larger casino, but I thought that hotel was tacky and somewhat creepy. The lobby has lots of bars and there is a starbucks there if you need one. All in all we had a great vacation - but make sure you have the right expectations. This is a place to relax, get a suntan and lay on the beach. If you're looking for a glitzy activity packed vacation you'll probably be a bit disappointed here. But we loved relaxing and found this hotel to be pretty good. I would go back, but perhaps would try another part of the island. The Intercontinental is the best hotel in this area from what we saw - so I would recommend it. It may not be as good as some other intercontinentals but it gets a B+ from me. I have definitely had some bad hotel experiences in the past, but lucky for us, this was not bad at all.

<Content>Excellent Resort Just got back from a 7day 6 night vacation with my husband and teenage daughter. The hotel met and exceeded my expectations. All the employees we encountered were polite and very helpful. We arrived Sunday night and received lots of tips from Jesus who works 3 to 11pm. We found the room to be nice and clean. The bed was wonderful. We stayed on the 15th floor after receiving an upgrade and had a spectacular ocean/pool view. The room was cleaned everyday. We took the advice of previous travelers and didn't eat at the hotel restaurants. We ate breakfast across the street at MiCasitas, good food and even better prices. We found the area surrounding the hotel to be nice and safe to walk all hours day or night. We walked to several restaurants for dinner, Metropol being our favorite. There are taxi's located outside the hotel for your convenience. We took a cab to Old San Juan, it was wonderful and culturally rich. We went to Old Morro (The Fort) then we had Mollorcas and Puerto Rican coffee at La Bombanero (recommended by Rachel Ray). It was delicious. The cab ride roundtrip was $42.00. We went to the rainforest and the views were breathtaking, it is a nice hike, so wear comfortable shoes. The waterfall inside is beautiful. We ate at a road side Kisok, the rice and beans were delicious. On the tour, we were provided with lots of information about the Island and its history. Great tour, provided through the hotel. We also took a trip to Plaza Las Americas, the big mall there, very nice, there are upscale and regular stores throughtout. It is very large.We found getting around by taxi very efficient and they are readily available. All in all, we had a wonderful time and would go back in a heart beat.

<Content>Do Not Stay at The InterContinental San Juan - Not worth the money..... I recently stayed at Intercontinental San Juan Resort and was thoroughly disappointed. I am familiar with the hotel brand and expected alot more from the hotel. I arrived at 5pm on 08/02/08. My room was not ready. My room was not available until after 8pm. My reservation was for a Laguna View and was made back on May 3. I received a regular room with no explanation. Upon entering the room, I noticed the bathroom was filthy. The bath tub was dirty and the bath mats were dirty as well. The refrigerator was molded and stained. The comforter was stained. I dropped a pen beside the bed and night table. When I leaned down to pick it up, there were old cookies in the floor that apparently had never been cleaned up. I was thoroughly disgusted. I didn't even unpack. I immediately went downstairs and asked for a manager. The front desk told me there was no manager available. I explained to her the situation and told her if that was best your hotel could offer at your prices I would rather find another hotel. She just stood there looking at me like I was crazy. She then told me I would have to pay for a night stay and a 100.00 penalty even though I received none of what I paid for. We stayed and our stay continued to get worse. Housekeeping left one towel an one washcloth for two people. We asked for extra towels for the next day. When they cleaned they took the extra towels we requested. The towels left were stained. While we were on the beach a worker comes over to us and tells us they start collecting the beach chairs at 5:30. The sun is still up and if you are paying $200 plus a night you should be able to stay until sunset at least. I will never stay there again.I previously stayed at the Howard Johnson and Embassy Suite much better rates, cleaner, and better staff.

<Content>Better than I dreamed it could be! Just spent 5 days at this beautiful hotel with my family. The entire experience was relaxing, pampering and very classy.Every employee we encountered was polite and helpful; restaurants are amazing, pool and beach are pristine; spa services were spectacular. Had great weather days and an excursion to sail and snorkel was awesome. The negative reviews I had read before the trip must have come from people who weren't prepared to act and spend like a four diamond guest at a four diamond hotel--you get what you pay for and everything was worth it. Sure, you can save some money eating across the street at the fast food joints; but while on vacation, why not experience the new? The bus ride to Senor Frogs was dicey but spend the money on the cab--you'll get there faster and with less stress. There is never a wait for pool/beach chairs, restaurants, taxis. The drinks are a little pricey and weak but if you stick to the 32 ouncers, (like the voodoo!) you get your money's worth. Restaurants have an amazing wine/specialty drink menu.Take the leap and make this your next vacation spot--you'll have a great time.

<Content>Great Place to Stay I have stayed in this hotel twice, both for 4-5 day getaways. It's super convenient to the airport (5 minutes away) and San Juan is easy to get to from the east coast. Perfect for a quick beach trip. This hotel, in my opinion is an excellent choice for just such a vacation.Staff is friendly, helpful, and responsive. We had a very good experience in all of our interactions with them.The facility is very well maintained with the feel of an upscale beach resort. Casino is decent sized and has a good variety of tables and machines. It's not Vegas of course but it will fit the bill if you are looking to gamble. I was generally able to find a spot at a $5 blackjack table. The rooms are spacious and well decorated. However, I concur with the other reviewers that the walls can be kind of thin, hopefully you get good neighbors. The bed was comfortable and our room was cleaned well daily, no problems with maid service.Hotel restaurants are good, Ruth's Chris makes a mouth watering steak and the breakfast buffet, while not cheap, was well done. The beach is great, spacious and uncrowded. We loved it! The pool here is top notch, plenty of space and chairs both shady and sunny. The bar also makes good drinks (although really pricey). The hotel has efficient and plentiful security. The neighborhood of Isla Verde is fine to walk around in both the days and evenings. There isn't a ton of stuff around though. If you are looking for a neighborhood with more restaurants and nightlife you might be better off going to the Condado area of San Juan. Overall, I would return and recommend this as a quality place to stay in San Juan.

<Content>Absolutely Enjoyed It!!! My boyfriend and I have been planning our wonderful romantic get a way about 4 months in advance, after much reviews from tripadvisor, travelocity and everything else i could find we finally decided to travel to San Juan. It was a quick flight for both of us and we knew we wanted to stay somewhere fun and yet romantic at the same time. We choose to stay in Isla Verde and Im glad we did. All the beaches in P.R. are public and this particular beach, is lined with a strip of hotels. Upon arrival to intercontinental we were greeted by HELPFUL, sweet and really nice bell hops and service guys. We arrived early before check in which is 4 pm. They took our bags, allowed us to check in, and use their facilities while we waited for our room to get ready. We strolled the hotel, which is beautiful. It has an amazing pool and jacuzzi, a spa, 24 gym, and the beach is right in the backyard. There are many restaurants to eat at.Now at Intercontinental, im sure you can book the cheapest room and have the same experience. We purchased a laguna room and we face the front of the city towards san juan. You can see the city lights and sky at night from our balcony. This time of year seems to be tropical rainy season, which we had for the first 2-3 days but it doesnt last long, usually at night, and even if it kinda ruin your plans for the day, your room and the hotel is a great place to stay. We didnt eat much here at the hotel because we know it is expensive, but this ave is a strip full of hotels and shopping area. Right across the street there is a little center. There is ponderosa food (which is kinda like a buffet salad bar, finger food type place), lins chinese which is excellent, and this puerto rican home cooked style place called Mi Casita, which my bf and I particular loved, the food is great and the price is reaaaallllyyy cheap. We had breakfast 1 morning, and it was only $12 for the both of us, they give you really good food and the right portion. They are open from 7am-10pm, most places here close @ 11pm so make sure you eat according to time. There is also wendy's, burger king, a little supermarket, a walgreens a few blocks down, (make a right when you exit the hotel in front entrance).For night life, we went from hotel to hotel. Intercontinental is classy and sophisticated, but if you need a dj, bar, lounges and music, head to El San Juan Hotel, which is left from intercontinental. They have a huge hotel lobby which is fun and exciting, the dj plays music and there is also a house band for a more local experience. There is also lounges and alot of bars, dress to impress at these places.To the right of intercontinental, at the water club approx 2-3 blocks down, then a sharp right.. there is a restaurant called Tangerine/ Liquid. And a roof top sushi bar on the 17th foor, open roof that overlooks the ocean. Prices are ok. There is also local shops, bars, grills and other places on this avenue. For a Local experience, head to old san juan. We took the bus, it was just like a NYC bus. 0.75 cents to the last stop takes you to the bus terminal downtown. Be prepared to walk. We walked the tourist area where the cruise ships dock and also made our way to the historic sites, by the forts which was $3.00 per person to enter, definitely worth it because it was fun and you get a great view of San Juan.El Yunque Rainforest is a must. There is a half day trip from 9:30am-3pm. Its $57.00 a person through the hotel. The tour guide picks you up, gives you a tour while driving, a cave trip, history of P.R., rainforest info, and waterfall treats. This rainforest is about a 1.5 hr trip. Alot of walking, defintiely a cardiovascular workout, uphill and downhill through the forest, very beautiful and romantic .. a must see.. we stopped for lunch at a local place right by the rainforest for what i thought was some of the best P.R. food ever, definitely try the beans and rice with fried chicken and sweet plaintains, ($1.00 items -$6.00) other packages include 3 trips, the rainforest, beach and a nite rafting trip, supposedly the water illuminates in the nite while you boat near the forest. Food on the Hotel: we ate by the beach, at Splash , mostly wraps, finger foods, salads.. good food. drinks and food from $12. other than that, we didnt do much, the casino is not as big as some other hotels but if you dont like to gamble much like me, its ok.You can hotel hop, and no one I.D.'s you , you can enjoy the facilities everywhere. overall this was a great experience and i hope if others are like me, i hope this helped. I thought the service was great, the customer service was excellent, we never had a problem and if we did they were more than happy to help us, very friendly and CLEAN.. our rooms were cleaned everyday with new towels and linens. coffee maker, ice bucket, fridge, safe, iron, alarm clock (ipod home) and cable t.v. in room. official website and pics are accurate.. a beautiful experience!! and complimentary wireless internet from every room which i am submitting this review since we are leaving tomorrow :)we didnt rent a car but if you feel you need too, the hotel has an avis hook up in the lobby where you can get , if you need to or change your mind 24hr rental for about $40 .

<Content>Great long weekend at the Intercontinental! Spent a long weekend in July at the Intercontinental San Juan and had a wonderful time. It is in the Isla Verde area which is the right location if you're looking for a relaxing beach vacation with easy access to activities and other parts of San Juan.The hotel grounds are beautiful with a large pool area. Never had much trouble finding chairs because there are so many to go around. Security is superb here. You need wristbands (a different one each day) to even enter the pool area. Your name is looked up on a list, and if the pool attendants find any discrepancies - they call the front desk to verify. This was very impressive. The beach area, footsteps away from the pool, is gorgeous and not terribly crowded. There is no problem finding a nice spot to lay out, and beach chairs and umbrellas are always available. Walk down the beach towards the El San Juan to take part in fun water activities like jet skiing and parasailing.A main point to be noted is the staff at the Intercontinental is exceptionally friendly and helpful! Every request is met with a smile and a cheerful my pleasure. My only complaint is with the maid service. Yes our room was made up every day, but not completely. The coffee maker was never cleaned out, sugar packets never refilled, and we were never left with more than one new fresh towel unless we requested more. Still, this was the only annoyance we really had with the staff and the hotel in general and would definitely return if we visit PR again!

<Content>Just so-so I used trip advisor review as a major part of my decision to stay at the Intercontinental, as well as a friends recommendation. We had stayed at the Ritz previously. I booked an ocean view rm and the price at the time of my stay was approx 400+ dollars plus the daily resort fee. We arrived around 1 pm and did have to wait for the normal check in time. Our room was gorgeous and had a great view. However, the walls were literally paper thin. Every day I would go up to the room around noon and there were children in the room directly next to us, they were singing and jumping on the beds, throwing objects against the wall and so on. This would go on until early evening, I never saw them, or an adult. I found that very strange. The beach was very nice but you had to reserve and pay for an umbrella. The pool area was nice, just small. The weather was very hot and very bright, no complaints. I think the one thing that really really surprised me was the cost of food there. Make no mistake, it might as well be Hawaii or the caribbean. Lunch at the beach restaurant for two daily was over $50 and we are talking pizza or salads. I was very disappointed in the housekeeping, very hit or miss. Some days I had to call after 4pm as they had not been there and we really needed at least more towels so we could get ready for dinner. We ate at Ruth Chris as well as the Palm and the food was very good but very very expensive. The hotel Italian restaurant was very good, very very expensive. I would guess each meal was close to $200 for two. The elevators were very hit and miss as well and as I read reviews today, I wonder why that problem cannot be fixed.some days only one elevator and it is a long wait. So I guess I would end my review by saying this hotel never lived up to my expectations, perhaps I had set them too high?The casino was very sad, very few machines and it seems there are no rules as to dress and behavior. I saw many many people eating food they had obviously brought from home -it just did not add to a resort atmosphere. Did gamble at the El San Juan, just lovely and what a beautiful lobby and bar area.

<Content>Intercontinental Staff Is Awesome! IBar staff Rocks! Wonderful Time! What an amazing vacation!! Puerto Rico is wonderful! The people were very friendly and happy. They really seemed to be proud of their home. Living in such a beautiful place , I can understand why. The Intercontinental is a beautiful hotel. It's not far from the airport, so you can start your vacation immediately and stay until the last possible minute. The beach was gorgeous. The staff at the hotel were all extremely helpful and friendly. The staff at the IBar were especially great. David, one of the bartenders, is terrific! I was on a girls trip with my friend (no husbands or kids) and the staff really made us feel welcomed and at ease. The excursion to the Rainforest was wonderful. Make sure to ask for Hector's tour. He was very knowledgeable and fun too. The snorkeling trip to Culebra was awesome too. The concierge booked everything for us. It was a wonderful, worry free vacation. I will be back as soon as I can. I enjoyed every minute of it!Marsha -Atlanta, GA

<Content>Superior service We had a great time at this hotel. The wonderful experience started from the first minute we pulled up in the taxi. We were met with some of the friendliest and most helpful staff we have experienced in all our travels. Everyone we interacted with (front desk, conceirge, door staff, bell staff, pool people, waiters, etc.) treated us extremely well and really made the experience. Even Socorro at the Avis counter in the hotel was extremely helpful!Our Club Intercontinental room was right by the pool, gym and spa. We apprecited the additional privacy and ability to walk right out to the pool area and the beach. The furnishings were a tasteful Caribbean motif (no over the top sea foam green and flamingo pink) with a lot of tropical wood. The onlyissues were that the sliding glass door was hard to open and close, the walls were a little on the thin side if you have really loud talkers (we have those neighbors for one day) and the ceiling in the bathroom was a little low. We used the gym. It was one of the nicest hotel gyms we have ever used. Everything was new.We did have our last lunch at the hotel's Japanese offering, Momoyama. The Pepper Tuna appetizer was amazing. The rest of the sushi was good, but nothing spectular. The staff was, again, extremely friendly.We loved this hotel and will definitely stay there the next time we are in San Juan.

<Content>Honeymoon Location I stayed at the Intercontinental last week for my honeymoon from 7/14 to 7/20. The hotel was very nice with many amenities to keep you busy. With so much to do in Puerto Rico we did not completely use all the features they provided. Please note: things are pretty pricey at the Intercontinental but there are very affordable places to eat right across the street such as Mi Casita (Puerto Rican food), Burger King, Ponderosa.We were so facintated with other places along the island such as El Morro in Old San Juan, Ponce, and even took a day trip to Culebra Island to see one of the most stunning beaches I've ever seen in Flamenco Beach. It would be a waste to come all the way to Puerto Rico and not see everything it has to offer.Overall the hotel was very nice and accommodating. I would definitly be back next year to celebrate my one year anniversary.

<Content>Excellent trip for little kids The wife and I just returned from a late June one week stay. Kids are 3 and 5. Pool is great for kids that age and pool very nice, clean and accessible. No seaweed anywhere and I'm assuming that when it does accumulate it's after a storm and the hotel would clean it up promptly. Service was great except for the concierge and we had no problems with housekeeping. And yes we got the free upgrade but I think that was possible because there were available rooms and it was low season - I wouldn't count on it at different times of the year.We booked the trip through Costco - all very smooth and the breakfast special they get you is great. If you have kids go to El Morro in Old San Juan on a cloudy day and fly kites for a day - easiest kite flying conditions you'll ever have due to the wind -- and you can buy kites there for $3-$4. Also, the hotel based Avis lady gave me a great tip on where to eat near Luquillo Beach -- try the Kiosko #2 La Parilla if you like seafood ! That beach is about 45 minutes away and is beautiful to be sure but extremely hot hot hot and zero wave action.The hotel and facilities were great and I'd recommend the place to somebody with little kids but to help you manage your expectations I've listed some negatives below.Negatives:1) the 3 elevators servicing 16 floors were unreliable and kind of a pain but most of the guests took it well so it was a running joke.2) the concierge(s) were useless and actually gave bad information. For example, I told them that I'd be taking the kids to Old San Juan and asked them if it would be easy to find some simple food for them there -- like a pizza. They said there were no such choices and instead directed me to an Italian sit down restaurant and a Caribean themed restaurant. When I went anyway and went to the center of town - the Plaza de Armas - I found myself surrounded by familiar kids places - mcdonalds, wendy's, burger king, etc. This would lead me to conclude that the concierges get compensated for directing people to specific places. They also gave me misinformation about the trip to Culebra Island. The concierge you see in hotel website video must have retired or something.3) if you read reviews about the local, nearby restaurants be forewarned. The Mi Casita restaurant is close and may be good but it's always packed for dinner so don't expect to just walk over. Also, the Fast Food places near the hotel are the slowest I've ever experienced - the Burger King was stunning in it's tortoise pace, and we left after waiting for 15 minutes in a line that didn't move. The Wendy's was slightly faster. The workers were nice enough but totally inefficient. So dinners are a problem unless you drive elsewhere.Avoid:Rain forest excursion - It's 1 hour there, 1 hour back and then 90 minutes in a bus through the forest with a little 20 minutes walk. Total waste of time and I wish I had driven there myself and walked around on my own. I guess if you can't walk or are drunk from a cruise the excursion might make sense but otherwise it's a waste.

<Content>All in All a Great Time We stayed at the Intercontinental from 7/8 through 7/12. I had a package that included the breakfast buffet and a tour of the rain forest. I was travelling with my husband, two young kids and my father - so clearly it was mixed company. However, all of us had a great time there. The overall experience was sublime. So here are my thoughts:1) Hotel Beach and pool: The Pool is fabulous ..it has a swim up bar, jacuzzi, and several waterfalls. The water is as deep as as 61/2 feet and as shallow as 3. I would just sit under the waterfall and get a water massage. There were plenty of seats/cabanas at the pool. The beach too is nice. There was a bit ofseaweed but nothing out of control. You can rent an umbrella for the beach but we just found a palm tree and moved our seats under it. The waves can be a bit rough at times so those with small children should be careful but my 9 and 7 year had way too much fun.2) Food: We had our very first meal there at Mi Casita across the street. Very friendly and reasonably priced. I did try the mofongo. The filling was fabulous but the mofongo itself is a quite bland (not the reataurants fault ..just the way it is). I found the food to be pricey in PR overall not too many mid priced choices. We did eat at Ruth's Chris in the hotel one day which was wonderful. As for my other favorite place it was Tantra in OSJ. We ate at Barrachina in Isla Verde as it came so highly recommended by everyone. Maybe we did not order the right things or the one in OSJ is better..but this was my only really bad food experience. It just was not that special compared to what you were paying. I had ordered a Nacho Platter and it was the worst I have had and I really cant imagine messing that up. As I mentioned we did the breakfast buffet. It was great and the all the wait staff is so nice.3) Transportation: We rented a car one day ..to go to the Bio bay. The driving wasn't too bad you just have to be a bit more vigilant and the road signage is not the greatest. But we dont have any horror stories to report there. We rented the car from the Avis right in the hotel and it was easy to be able to pick up and return the car right there. We also used the bus one day. Not bad, takes you through some bad areas but you are not going there so who cares. The bus is clean and air conditioned and only cost 75 cents to OSJ. One thing no one told us is they take exact change only..no bills allowed. 4) Sites we visited: El Yunque, fascinating but it was my least favorite. Bio Bay (vieques) we used East Wind Cats. Loved that though the time in the water was too short. El Morro, loved that too its an amazing structure a must see. OSJ is wonderful ..the most charming architecture and cute shops.My only issue at the hotel was that we originally did not get a room with a king bed though our reservation stated that. However the hotel upgraded us to an ocean view room with a king bed.Everyone in the hotel and PR was so nice, I was sad to leave.

<Content>Fabulous Experience The service at the Intercontinental was superior. Everyone from the concierge to housekeeping staff was polite and went out of their way to ensure that our stay was pleasurable. The hotel is very conveniently located and the beaches of Isla Verde are very pretty. I would definately stay here again and would recommend this hotel without hesitation.

<Content>Not bad I chose this hotel for my girlfriend and I because it was close to the airport and close to San Juan. I made a good choice. I rented a car at the airport for $20 per day and drove to the hotel. We jumped in the ocean asap and was surprised that it was better than the reviews I had read. The beach was not outstanding, but it was warm and not crowded. The pool was nice, but smaller than I expected. The room was nice, eventhough we had a supersaver deal and they put us on a lower floor.The food was expensive, so the car came in handy to search out nice restauants. We drove to San Juan almost every night. San Juan has alot to offer, it was not a disappointment. All in all this was not a world class hotel, but it met my expectations. I would probably go back , given the opportunity.

<Content>Watch out for the Incidential Fees $100 per Day! No Warning I went on a family vacation, the hotel was nice, employees were nice, housekeeping came everyday, beach was beautiful, pool was pretty. Casino was small but when you can get a waitress they will gvie you free drinks and a hot sandwich! I had a city room over looking the main entrance. Comfortable beds, large towels, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, shower cap, shoe shine cloth, soap. Iron, hair dryer, fridgem coffee machine. In room safe, cable TV.Only thing missing was a microwave.However, you are not told when you book the room that they will charge a hold on your credit card $100.00 incidential fee for each day that you stay. I had 2 rooms so that was $800.00! they put on hold. I tried to argue with them stating that they were tying up $$ that I was planing on using during my stay. I told them that I had booked it directly from Intercontential and there was no mention of this fee only the 22% tax and resort fee on top of your room fee. They went on to explain that that's what all the hotels do and there was nothing that they could do because when they put through you credit card it automatically adds the $100 a day. Needless to say my credit card was short a couple of hundred so it was not approved and I had to give them another credit card or cash for the difference or they could not give me the room! As I was checking out 4 young ladies were checking in and to their dismay they were being told about the $100/day inc. fee, they too had to scrabble for the extra cash or else they could not get the room. I will be calling the hotel's main office to put in a formal complaint regarding this practice. It should be disclosed so that customers know that they will need extra money to be floating in a hold until your trip is over.We had 2 blackouts while we were there, one that was pre- scheduled by the power company between 10 am -2pm. And another one unanounced at about 8 am and lasted an hour. I was disappointed with the area in general. I am of Puerto Rican descent and it pains me to see such an unkept area. The streets needed repairs, there were abandon buildings in the area, your local homeless people, only one authentic puerto rician restaurant in the area. No Puerto Rican bakeries, or Pastellio /Alcapuria places in the area. With all the five star hotels in the areas you would think that they would invest in the surrounding community so that more people would come back not only for their hotel but for the culture itself. Tip: When you get to the aiport look for the tourism kisko, they wear orange shirts and they will make you a ticket for a cab to take you to the hotel they give you a fair price from the airport. However you have to watch some of the cab drivers, some just charge you $1 per checked luggage and some will charge you for every piece of luggage or carry on baggage. Same about of bags, I paid $4.00 extra coming and $8.00 going. Overall, the hotel was nice, staff was nice, the beach was awesome- clear water, some waves (watch small children-waves are sometime rough), it was warm, no fish just some sand dollars, no shells in the water most days. Go early to get a free beach chair, once they are gone they rent chairs for $4.00 a day, but they take them back at 6 pm. , so be prepared to sit on the sand if you want to stay pas 6 pm. Pool has plenty of chairs and cabanas, water fall is cute, goes up to 6 '6. Several sections to hang out in. Use lots of sunscreen, sun doesn't feel that hot but you will get burned fast!Go to Mi Casita for Puerto Rican food, range $8.00-$24 for dinner. Go to Walgreens for water, soda, snacks, coffee, slurppies. Pueblo supermarket is behind Embassy Suite hotel about a 8 minute walk. Fast food, Church's Chicken is pretty good, there's a Pizza Hut that is good and clean. Burger King, Wendy's, KFC is also there. The mini mart across the street is not well stock but for an emergency they'll do. This is still mi Isla Bonita, they just need to spruce it up a bit. with the help of the surrounding hotels.

<Content>Classy, Well Maintained, and Great Service My husband and I visited in mid-June for our honeymoon. I chose the Intercontinental over several hotels in the same area, and we are so glad we did! We were upgraded to an ocean view room upon arrival. The ocean view is SPECTACULAR! You can see the neat, tropical pool area too. We were offered early check-in, pretty much as soon as we arrived from the airport. The room was the perfect size for a couple, chicly decorated, and although they did miss a day or two of cleaning it, housekeeping responded promptly to all of our requests.Pluses: Beautiful hotel, very clean, wonderful service from bell boys to housekeeping to concierge, several on-site restaurants and bars, great TVs in rooms, near a couple cute places like Lupis down the street, and fun/large pool areaMinuses: Sub-par food at all the restaurants including room service food, WAY OVERPRICED food and drink (just don't plan to eat and drink within the hotel unless you like $15 made-from-frozen hamburgers and $10 vodka-cranberries), not the most glamorous or convenient location (cost us $22 minimum to take a cab anywhere we wanted to go - there just isn't much to do in this part of San Juan)Overall we had a romantic, lovely time, felt like we got a relatively good deal (paid $2300 total for the two of us for 4 nights/5 days - included airfare, hotel, food/drink while there, cab rides, and a kayaking trip), and would return!

<Content>Great Beach Hotel I really enjoyed my time at The InterContinental San Juan Resort, Spa  Casino. The beach and pool areas were excellent. Nice large towels and comfy lounge chairs. I found the restaurants in the Hotel to be pricey. We went across the street to the plaza and found the food to be cheaper and better. Be warned: the fast food retaurants are very slow! My only complaint is the housekeeping was good some days and bad other days. The street the Hotel was on, was sometimes difficult to cross. But other than that it was all good.

<Content>Very Impressed Rooms very nice we booked 2 laguna views but for $40 more a night per room we were upgraded to 10th and 11th floor ocean views. The featherbed pillow tops were so comfy that we ordered 2 when we got home. The free wireless internet is very fast I was getting download speeds of 220 kbs. The free in room safe was huge big enough for a laptop. and an empty fridge was very useful. The first day we stocked up with lots of beer softdrinks and liquor from the supermarket across the road. The casino has waitresses providing free alcoholic drinks and sandwiches which are gorgeous we loved their pina coladas. We play video poker machines and we were a bit dissapointed that the machines here only pay out 5 credits for 2 pair this can make a huge difference to play time as vegas machines pay out 10 credits for 2 pair this together with the wait times for the elevators were the only negatives for this hotel. We had to push both up and down on the elevators and go along for the ride just to get on else you could be standing there for many minutes. The ocean was the nicest I have ever been in very warm and clean and with a very welcome constant breeze. We ate once in the breakfast buffet it was very nice but about $5 overpriced. Also we ate once in Alfredos italian. the prices for the food are not to bad but the wine list is very overpriced the cheapest was $40. For 4 with wine was $230. We went to mi Casita for breakfast very reasonable but extremely slow. It took 10 minutes to bring a menu 20 minutes for coffee and 30 minutes for the food to arrive. We also ate at Lupis, Metropol and the Ranch all excellent. If you go at the end of june you may see this guy in the photo walking the beach he comes every year and entertains the ladies. The cab fare is $15.50 from the airport for 4 with 4 bags and $21 to old san juan try to get dropped off at the castillo san felipe del morro as the walk through old san juan is then mostly down hill. The liquor laws seem very loose here as they served my 16 year old daughter without question. Also the duty free in the airport allows purchases to the US. All in All an excellent vacation which I give 8 out of 10

<Content>Nice beach and pool, poor housekeeping Negatives:-Stayed at San Juan Isla Verde arrived around 1p, not accommodated w/ early check in until 4p by that time kids were cranky and tired. -House keeping horrible, dirty comforter was set aside to be changed instead they used the same comforter, flipped it around. Did not come daily, had to call to get room made. -Bathroom is small. -Cafe by pool and Italian place included tip charges even for take out. -Business center charges a fee for internet services. Positives:-Hotel decorated nicely...most of staff very friendly-kids love the pool and beach, beach entrance closes early. -taxi convenient located outside the hotel--mini mall w/ food restaurants across the street (starbucks next hotel over), brand name pharmacy walking distance-provides towels and beach chairs for beach-mini Refrigerator, iHome radio, made in Paris hair shampoo/cond, comfortable bed-small casino open 12n-4am....can use casino comp towards food and room-Restaurants in hotel: Cafe by pool - good freshly made pizza, Jap restaurant - great habachi, Ruth Chris...do not recommend Italian restaurant-rent a car availableTaxi cost (not including tips)...beats paying for gas and looking for parking:-To and from hotel: $10.5-11.00 each way-To and from Plaza las Americas mall: $18 each way (supposedly biggest in carribean - typical american malls)-To and from Old San Juan: $19 each way (lots of souvenir shops, stores are small and do not accommodate strollers, food costly esp authentic puerto rican food).

<Content>Great Honeymoon Experience My wife and I stayed at the Intercontinental for our honeymoon. We were there for 4 nights. Upon arrival we were greeted by some very friendly doormen who helped us with our bags and also immediately fixed a mixup with our parking. The valet service costs more than just parking your car yourself, so I wanted them to bring back my car so I could park it myself in the parking lot across the street. They were very understanding and quick about it. When we checked in, I asked what type of room we had since we booked it through priceline and they didn't give us any room information. They informed me that we were in a city-view room and that it could be upgraded for an additional cost. I told the lady at the counter it was our honeymoon and they upgraded us to an ocean view room at no additional cost. The woman at the front desk also informed us that the power was out and some things were running on generator power but that didn't include lights and AC in the rooms. During this time, the elevators were working intermittently which was a bit annoying. Luckily the power was back on in about an hour.The staff at the hotel was very responsive and very friendly. If there was anything we needed, they either had it or found a way to get it. At one point the memory card in my wife's digital camera broke and got stuck in the camera. We called the desk and asked if they had tweezers or something we could use to remove the damaged card. Within minutes, they sent an engineer to our room with a pair of pliers and he carefully removed the card without damaging the camera.The room we had wasn't very big and the bathroom was very small. Nothing very fancy about it. But the view of the ocean outside our little balcony was fantastic. At times we just left the sliding doors open so we could listen to the ocean. We also had a pretty good view of the pool area which is very nice. We spent quite a bit of time in the pool and at the wet bar. We met another couple our age from Philadelphia and actually went out to dinner with them that night at a place recommended to us by one of the doormen.The bartenders at the hotel were great. The bartender we had at the pool was very friendly. She was happy to take our picture and her service was stellar. The bartender at the bar in the lobby was very nice as well.The hotel had a good security staff as well. They stressed the importance of only letting hotel guests onto the premises which made me feel better about my things not being stolen. When I told one of the security staff that no one had checked to see if I was a guest the day before, he said that it was unacceptable and he would correct the problem.This was our first trip to Puerto Rico and it was very memorable. Our honeymoon was everything we hoped it would be. I will definitely stay at the Intercontinental if/when I return to Puerto Rico.

<Content>B- Hotel Overall, the room was just okay..nothing spectacular. Upon arrival the bathroom was disgusting. We called down and they sent someone up right away to clean it so they get an A for responsiveness. The workout room was slightly below average and several of the machines were broken.The pool was great and they had two different venues to dine at. Beware of the concierge staff...I would only deal with Nestor the others were not helpful or as knowledgeable.I would recommend booking excursions in advance since they fill up quickly. I can highly recommend www.acampapr.com. They are wonderful! DO NOT USE Adventuras! They are unreliable and have bad business practices. I have traveled all over the world and I have never been more appalled then with this tour operator. We asked around with the locals an apparently many others have had the same experience.Besides Acampa picks you up and drops you off at your hotel, provides lunch, and ensures that a portion of the money they receive goes back into the local community whereas Adventuras does none of the above! You have to find your own way to a local mtg place, bring your own food and we've been told by the locals that they do not reinvest in the community. To top it off their staff is rude and there is no customer service. (If you are American beware if you call and converse with someone who only speaks spanish. They use that as an excuse to say that there must have been a misunderstanding.)

<Author>vacationerBoston
<Content>Nice hotel with many amenities We stayed here for 5 nights to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary. We were upgraded from a city view to a garden view room, which was on the 6th floor so you could see the ocean too. The room was a good size with a flat screen TV, separate couch/sitting area, fridge , plenty of counter space in the bathroom, and a small balcony. The bed was really comfortable. The AC unit like most everywhere I've stayed kicked on an off all night. There was no noise by the pool at night (I had been concerned about this) and very quiet in the halls, no noise from other rooms.Check in-our room wasn't ready until after 3, which was a pain b/c we got there at 10:30, not the hotel's fault by any stretch and they did offer us the hospitality suite if we wanted to change.One recommendation I would have would be for the hotel to invest in a couple of inexpensive chairs to fit on the balconies, it would really increase the experience to be able sit outside with coffee in the AM, or 'apre beach' to watch the sunset. The hotel surprised us with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a lovely note from Irene, the guest relations manager whom I corresponded with prior to our visit. That was a really nice touch.The beach was great. I think the umbrellas should just be included in the cost of the room. For us they were a must as we are not used to the hot hot sun. Sometimes they would run out of towels if you went down late afternoon. But no rush to get chairs etc. The pool area was beautiful, we didn't use the pools though, as we like the beach better. The beach could get windy sometimes to the point of being sandblasted. The water was beautifully warm, and no seaweed. The beach was clean and it was great to have the little cafe/bar right there, though expensive!! Sticker shock even though I was warned. It gives one pause to ordering a bunch of frozen drinks all day! Nice mellow bar with friendly staff. We only ate at the cafe (an OK pizza), and Al Fredo for an appetizer of prosciutto and melon. Breakfast was really only the expensive buffet, we sat at the bar for a couple of coffees that ran $10.If you get off campus we ate at Metropol twice, great down home Cuban/Puerto Rican food. Mi Casita for breakfast once, OK, but not great service from our waitress who insisted on giving us American coffee when we wanted it Puerto Rican style. We also ate Mexican at Lupi's, it was OK.Taxi's as others have said expensive, $25 w/tip to Old San Juan. Did not use the spa. Gambled a bit, small casino, but you can get a $5 blackjack table and not as intimidating as some of the larger casinos if you're not a big gambler.I guess if I'm not sounding overly enthused it is because I discovered I really like smaller hotels. We also didn't rent a car, so while everything you really need is right at the hotel, it can cost a small fortune. For a family vacation I don't see how it could be affordable if you only stayed on campus. The area outside the hotel is urban. We walked around a bit to check out some of the other hotels. The Walgreens only had two aisles open, the supermarket seemed like it was ready to close down too. The mall is definitely not a mall, just a few stores-not that we were looking for a mall, but in case someone is! Overall I found it a perfectly acceptable nice place to stay, nice lobby area, gorgeous pools, beach, restaurants, spa, casino, bar. A pretty mellow 'scene', unlike the El San Juan which was very glitzy. But I would stay in a different area next time. Oh and the planes nearby were no problem.

<Content>This was great I initially booked my vacation to stay at the El San Juan, and after reading the horrible reviews, I decided to switch over to the Intercontinental. I was so relieved I did that. My friend and I got there at around 10am, we were checked in, and we hung out by the pool for about an hour and a half. They called me on my cell and we got a city view room on the top floor wiht a balcony, and the view really isn't as bad as it sounds. The room was extremely spacious, with enough closet space and a generous bathroom, big enough for two girls to get ready for the night and not be in each other's way. There were plenty of clean towels always on hand, the cleaning people were great and cleaned our room every day. My only complaint is that the water pressure wasn't that great, but maybe I'm just used to my shower at home. The room was basic but modern, and the beds are really comfortable, maybe a little too soft for me, but thats just my opinion.There is a Walgreens down the block, we stocked up on waters and chips to snack on at night, and there is plenty of space in the room's refridgerator for big bottles of water and stuff. It was perfect, actually.The pool area was very clean and very beautiful. We stayed on the beach every day though because it's just my preference. I liked the breeze on the beach and I rented an umbrella for 10 a day (which is worth every penny). The sun is extremely brutal in PR and both my friend and I who never burned got red, so make sure to wear sunscreen!The little cafe on the beach of the hotel was good, it was nothing to really write home about, but the prices were definitely very reasonable, and they make great drinks! The pina coladas and their Jungle Fever drink were always by myside. They have a waitress walking around the beach to bring you drinks and what not. Coming from the NYC area, these drinks are definitely reasonably priced.As for food, to me, nothing was terribly overpriced. The first night we went to the El San Juan to the Palm restaurant. That to me, was just overpriced Italian food, even though it was really good, it's just like home cooking to me so the prices were a little high. The second night we went to Ruth's Chris steakhouse in the hotel - PHENOMENAL!!! The steaks are pricey (but typical for steakhouses in the NorhtEast), but my friend and I saw a special they were having - $99 for two people, and we each got a salad, choice of meat (we chose the petite filets and they were to die for!! Like butter!) a side dish and dessert. Dessert wasn't so great, but then again, we were soooooo stuffed with our meal Id on't think our stomachs could have fit the dessert anyway.The last night we went to the hibachi restaurant in the hotel. Not my favorite place, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was. Plus we met this great couple that was on their honeymoon. She is a native of PR and told us about some places to go out for drinks and whatnot.We did go into Old San Juan one day. I love Old San Juan, way better than San Juan, and we heard that the night life out there is great, we just never made it out at night. The cab fare is $20 each way, but def worth it considering all the traffic and the congestion, that driving there yourself would not be fun. We went to the restaurant where they invented the Pina Colada, Barrachina or something like that. It's around the corner fromt he Burberry outlet, and it was AMAZING. so were the Pina coladas! I would def go back there.We didn't get to really experience the true nightlife as we were there during the week, and we were told by all the locals that nothing really got going until Thursday. We went over to the bar at the El San Juan, and I felt out of place, like I was too young to be there (I'm 26). Also, the drinks weren't made that great, and the staff at the El San Juan weren't as attentive or friendly, although I do believe that the pool area at the El San Juan was a little nicer and more modern, with more modern music playing. But as far as the rooms and the rest of the service, I can't say.You should def check out the Water Club. It's a 8-10 minute walk from the hotel, and it has a really cool rooftop lounge. Its def worth checking out.The concierge was very helpful and they have a list of excursions to take if you feel the need. We didn't, but looking back, I wish we had. We did go jetskiing, which was really fun. They're stationed on the beach right outside the El San Juan. 30 minutes was $70, which is a lot, but it was sooo fun. Some people complained about the seaweed - some days the water was chopier than others, but the seaweed tends to gather right on the shore, if you walk into the water a little further its completely gone and very clean. Overall my experience at the Intercontinental was great. I def would go back to PR, just not to San Juan.

<Content>We will stay at the Intercontinental again We stayed overnight at the Intercontinental Hotel on our way home to St. Croix. We were very pleased with the accommodations. The bed was extremely comfortable. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet. The service was extra friendly and efficient. The location is great if you need to stay in Isla Verde. The grounds are very pretty and well maintained.

<Content>Good times at Intercontinental I was a bit apprehensive about this hotel after going through many of the reviews here. Many have complained about the service, and I must say, we only had but amazing service when we went. There were 4 families that stayed in that hotel for a wedding and non of us had any issues with the hotel. Service was impeccable. FRONT DESK: here is where I thought I would run into issues. However, they proved me wrong and were more than helpful with checking in and any other questions I had for them. In fact, I had originally booked just a city-view room and they were kind enough to upgrade me and my parents-in-law to a beautiful and immensely big ocean view room. If you have any questions about restaurants and such, the concierge is very knowledgable and capable of guiding anyone to the right direction.ROOMS: the ocean-view room was amazing. HUGE. We had a king size bed that was beyond comfortable, a love seat, a one-seater, coffee table, and an office table. Needless to say, this room had plenty of space. The closet fit all of our clothes comfortably and there is a small space outside the bathroom for a vanity area where there is great lighting for prepping to go out and applying makeup. The bathroom is also quite spacious and has one of the most powerful showers I have ever experienced in my life. Showering at this hotel was fast and amazing. It was a massage and a shower in one! Lastly, everything was clean! A great plus for a germaphobe like myself.POOL: pretty large and very clean. Never any straws or any nasty things floating. There were many zones ranging from 3 feet to 6 feet. A couple of waterfalls for a nice hydro massage. They start giving the towels poolside at about 8am. This help curbing the habit of people saving the chairs too early. If you go early enough, before 9 froom what I have noticed, they even give you a neckroll along with the towel. They will give you a bracelet when you check these items out and upon returning them, do not forget to ask them to cut those pesky bracelets off.BEACH: We never laid out in the pool and stayed on the beach our entire stay. To us, nothing beats the sound of the ocean and the amazing breeze that puts us both to sleep quicker than we ever anticipate. The beach was clean. Not much seaweed. Out of the 4 days we were there, only once did I see a lot of seaweed. And they were quickly taken away by the staff. For those that love the calm beach, it all depends on the day. Our first day there, it was VERY rough. The waves were huge and intimidating. Each day thereafter, the waves and the ocean slowly calmed down; and our trip ended with very calm waters by the 4th day. I don't know if it is dependent on the weather on some other factor, but there was no consistency as far as how rough or calm the water was that day. There were plenty of beach chairs, so there was no need to get up early and save a chair. They also have umbrellas available for a fee (I think $10) and there is a staff member that will assist you in putting it in. RESTAURANTS: this is one aspect of the hotel I cannot be of any help. Sorry, but I did not eat at any of the restaurants after reading all the reviews about the prices they charge. However, my hubby did eat at Alfredo's, the Italian restaurant, for breakfast and he said the omelet was big and delicious. After I found out the price ($14), delicious should have been the least of what that omelet was! My parents-in-law ordered a pizza for room service and I remember them saying it was not memorable whatsoever. MISCELLANEOUS: The elevators were a bit on the slow side of things. Press LL on elevator if you want to bypass the lobby to go to the pool. The casino was fairly small at this place. Drinks at the bar were mostly around $10 to $14. We ate at the restaurant across the street for breakfast called Mi Casita. Service is beyond slow, but the price is just right. Most of the breakfast items were $5 give or take. I ordered the eggs, homefries, and toast for $4.95. The homefries has a different and addictive flavor that I've never tasted in any homefries before! There is also a convenience store next to Mi Casita. I highly suggest buying bottled water and juices here. I think the hotel charged $8 for the big Fiji water and $3.50 for the small bottles. A six pack of water bottles cost us about $3.50. Save your money and walk across the street and hang right for about a 1/2 a block. They are all there in that little strip mall. Within that strip mall is also a burger king and a ponderosa. In fact, there are so many American food restaurants that I was a bit disappointed of the location. Nonetheless, it is convenient for those who like them. Pamela's had amazing food...expensive, but worth every penny! La Pascaderia Atlantica had the best seafood ever! I'm salivating just thinking about it again. Definetly save room for the tres leches for dessert. Ridiculously delicious! Any of the bakeries around the area always had great bread and sandwiches. There is Reposteria Espana not too far from the hotel. For those needing Starbucks fix, right next door to our hotel is the El San Juan. There, you will find two Starbucks! Also great shopping at this hotel. It's very lively at night. Great band by the bars. Dress to impress if you go at night to party. But definitely a great place to hang out. Huge casino. The Intercontinental looks like a dot next to there's. We went to Old San Juan our last day since we had a 5:45 PM flight out of Puerto Rico. They tell you to be at the airpot 2 hours before departure. If you want a late check-out, the hotel charges about $75. Check out is at 12PM, but they were kind enough to give us till 1PM. Ask for the courtesy room if you don't want the $75 charge. I think they give you 30 minutes to use it. We checked out at 1 and gave our luggage to the bellhop and walked around Old San Juan for a couple hours. Taxi there is about $19 per way and takes between 10-15 minutes. Beautiful buildings and cobble-stone roads. La Bombanera had the best food! Ask for la mallorca (pronounced la mayorca). Goes wonderfully with coffee. Renting a car would be advisable. Taxis are very expensive there. Cost $7 to go down 2 hotels. If I didn't have the long dress on (on our way to the wedding) I would have walked that way! Intercontinental charges $16 for parking (self-park) across the street. Valet parking costs $22 per day. If your going to Old San Juan, parking is horrible! We took a taxi and were glad we did! Always ask for the price before you go in to avoid getting ripped-off! Have fun! Puerto Rico was a blast! email me for any questions.

<Content>Loved the Pool and Beach This is a wonderful hotel. My only disappointment is in Puerto Rico itself. 1. Hotel location-I was disappointed in the area around this hotel.Lots of American fast food places to eat at and no feel that you were in a different country. Might as well have been in Florida. Fast food joints were great for cheap lunches on the beach. 2.Pool/Beach-Whoever designed this pool did a fantastic job. The large waterfalls drown out any noise from the pool bar, pool restaurant and noisy people. There is a great mix of shade and sun. The towel people will only give you 1 towel each and 1 pillow each. The pillow was great.. They always gave us 4 large towels in the room for 2 people, so we just brought extra towels down with us to the bool/beach to compensate for the 1 towel per person allotment at the pool. The beach is large enough to really spread out and not be on top of others. Chaise lounge chairs were free but the umbrella was $10. You rent them from the pool/towel hut. The umbrellas are a little on the small side. My husband had a hard time getting completely under it. There was always something sticking out. Out of the 6 days we were there the water was calm 2 days, and rough 4 days. By rough I mean you could not relax and carry on a conversation in the water. You had to be very alert or get wiped out by a wave. Eventually, I just when in up to my knees. 3.Food/restaurants- Do yourself a favor and bring a collapsible cooler. Go to Walgreens..buy alot of water and pop. Fill your cooler with ice (provided at the hotel ice machine) and enjoy your cheap drinks on the beach. We also bought beer at the grocery store accross the street ($7 for 6 cans) and had our own cheap happy hour. The first day of arrival my husband and I split a cheeseburger/fries and he had a beer. The bill from the beachside restaurant came to $25 including tip. So needless to say that was the last day we ate hotel/beach food. My husband took the walk accross the street to fast food heaven and bought us Burger King or Taco Bell for lunch. Everytime he came back through the lobby with our lunch food, a Manager advised him he would not be allowed to eat it at the pool. Since we were on the beach this was not an issue. Just very annoying. For dinner we avoided the extremely pricey restaurants at the hotel and opted for Lupis (just past the El San Juan). They had what might be the best steak fajitas I have ever had. ($13,I think) and $3 Medella beers. Also ate 1 night at Outback(at Embassy Suites). At first the prices seem comparable to home until you realize they do not include the salad, like at home. Good meal. Just costs more than home.Hotel room- Got upgraded to an oceanview room. Slept every night with the door open to hear the waves. The room had a ceiling fan, so that kept us cool enough at night even with the door open. The room also had a lighted make-up mirror. The refrigerator is stocked with overpriced hotel beverages but, there is still alot of room to put your own beverages or leftover dinner.Car rental-We rented an intermediate for $30 a day including tax from Dollar rent a car at the Holiday Inn(1 block from Intercontinental). They do close at 5pm so unless you want to pay $16 to park it at the Intercontinental make sure you get going in the morning so that you can return it by 5pm. We drove to El Yunque and were able to hike to the waterfall, stop for lunch and shop Belz outlet mall. The drive to El Yunque takes longer than you think it will. Lots of stop lights made it take 1 1/2 hours. Hotel rate- I booked at Interline Travel.com. This website is for Airline employee discounted rates. We paid $208 per night for a lagoon view room. Their rates are a real deal when you realize the 22% taxes are included. I bought the AmbassadorClub membership ($150) from Intercontinental.com which gives you a one category room upgrade at check in. We would have been upgraded to Pool view but, since they didn't have any available ...we got upgraded to oceanview.Casinos-The El San Juan casino was our favorite. A good amount of 1 cent machines. This casino does get crowded on Wednesday and Thursdays with locals. (They must have some promotion for them because they were allover the penny machines.) We did not like the Intercontinental casino, at all. Not enough penny machines. And the ones they did have wouldn't take your bills or vouchers. They just kept rejecting anything you tried to put in them. The Embassy Suites casino was very small. Hope this helps you enjoy your stay as much as we did.

<Content>Nice, but not great! I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. The pool very nice and the beach was ok. The tide was a little ruff. The cafe was small but the food was excellent. Fair prices considering your at a resort. The waitresses and waiters was all friendly and courteous. The Pina Colada's were excellent.......Waleska made the best. The hotel was a little to quite for me and the casino was small and had out dated slot machines. We stayed in a suite which was nice and clean, but small compared to many suites I have seen. There was no tub, which in my opinion is not a suite. All the suites only had a city view with a very small balcony not big enogh for a small table or chair. And with having a city view suite there is not much privacy because you are on the front entrance side of the hotel and there is alot of traffic in and out of the hotel. There are plenty of places outside the resort to get food at a great price. Not sure of the exact name but I believe it's called Misa Casa ( great food /great price) which is in th shopping center across the street from resort. There is also a nice small sushi bar about a block up the street that served excellent sushi and the miso soup was to die for. I visited a few other hotels in the immediate area and found the El San Juan was the place to be to hang out on the weekends. All in all it was a good stay, I will return to Puerto Rico but probably will choose another hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I stayed at the InterContinental while on a young mommies ladies trip to San Juan. I read many reviews of Puerto Rico before my trip, with the majority of reviews stating that the service in Puerto Rico is slow, bad, or nonexistent. I must say that I had the opposite experience. Everyone at the InterContinental was friendly, helpful, and happy. This includes the front desk, concierge, bellhop, doorman, bartenders, waitstaff, chambermaids- you name it. We had a wonderful time. I was able to view the lobbies of nearby hotels and by comparison, I much preferred the atmosphere at the InterContinental. It was clean, bright, well decorated, easy to find what you were looking for, and never too crowded to find someone to help you with a request. The pool area was beautiful, right on the beach, had a lovely pool, plenty of seating, plenty of bars and food to choose from, waitstaff that would serve you poolside, plenty of greenery, and great weather to top it all off. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>fun, relax and explore This was our first visit to Purto Rico, and for our first stay we couldn't have chosen a more perfect place. The rooms were big, with a balcony and quite comfortable, and always kept clean. The staff were all very friendly but we found the concierge desk at all times to be very outgoing and helpful. One of the tours they recommended was the Catch a Dream Ranch, which was a 90 minute horse back riding experience like we will never forget thru the foothills of the rainforest and a run on the Rio Mar beach with a beautifull view of the El yungque rainforest in the background. We found the restaurant on the beach very nice along with several of the local area restaurants. Cabs are plentiful and the rates are set so regardless of the traffic situation your assured of the cost which we found quite reasonable and more relaxing than trying to rent a car and deal with the local traffic ourselves. Over all we had a great time.

<Content>Great Time We stayed on the 8th floor Ocean and Poolview and were a little blocked by the trees (for Poolview) ,none the less, it was very nice. The entire staff was attentive and we never had to open the doors when coming into the hotel or leaving. The staff would smile and acknowledge us everytime.Even though we bid through Priceline the front staff still treated us professionally and even upgraded the room to oceanview. Our check in time was very fast without any bumps. When we called for our bags to be brought up they arrived within minutes. I thought it was a joke because of how quick they arrived. The bellperson introduced himself and gave us some tips on our rooms and the area in general.The room was equipped with a refrigerator, flat screen tv, and a very comfortable bed. As others have mentioned, make a visit to the small market across the street or the Walgreen's and stock up on items that will save you from some of the ridiculous prices by the pool. Why not save your money for other things? Definitely give the restaurant down stairs MOMOYAMA. It was excellent and for a couple our total was around $70 tip included, so worth it.I did incur one problem and didn't get help from ANYONE which is why I didn't rate this hotel higher. I attempted to take money out of the ATM located in the hotel casino. The first attempt was for $200 and it said Sorry, we're unable to complete your transaction. So, I tried for $100 and received the same response. Knowing I had money in my account I checked my account online and it shows the withdrawals???? I spoke to the night manager at the casino and he said that the problem with the ATM happens sometimes(the ATM ran out of money) and that I would be credited. They refer me to the bank that owns the ATM and they tell me, We can't help you out cause your not one of our customers.I check my bank account two business days later and the charges are still there. I speak with the front office Manager at the hotel and tell him the above and once again I'm told it's not there ATM so he can't help me. Why would this hotel keep an ATM with this problem????After a call to my bank and putting in a dispute, MY BANK took care of the issue immediately after their dispute division contacted the ATM bank. MY money was credited back to me.Take care of problems that are continuous to customers and this hotel would have received 4.5 rating from me because overall we had a good time.

<Content>Decent stay at the InterContinental 11 of us girls stayed at the InterContinental Hotel for a bachelorette weekend. We all enjoyed our stay except for dealing with one of their employees, Barbara, who works at the Concierge desk. Stay away from her! She was NOT helpful, was extremely RUDE, and had a major attitude problem towards us as a few of the girls tried to check in (their vouchers were left at the Concierge desk as a few of the girls checked in a day or 2 later). We complained to the manager explaining how rude, and unhelpful she was; we are their hotel guests and spending A LOT of money to stay there; there was no need to deal with this kind of service! Jhazil, at the Concierge desk, was extremely helpful and recommended great clubs, restaurants, and bars to go to in Old San Juan (OSJ). Look for her to help you!Overall, our stay at the hotel was good. Small, comfy beds, and clean rooms and bathrooms. We asked for a late check out for 4pm and they gave it to us for free of charge (normally $75 for late afternoon check-out)! The cafe on the beach was great too - order the chicken tortilla wrap; it's delicious! The hotel is close to Walgreens, an ATM, ESJ Hotel, and the Ritz. Too bad it's far away from OSJ, but it's a close drive at least. We can't wait to go back to PR next year!

<Content>Good Hotel I stayed at the Intercontinental about 6 or 7 times. I always get a ocean view room on a high floor. The view is great and the room is clean. The balconies are very small. The staff is very polite and helpful. The hotel is situated on the best beach for visitors to P.R. My problem is with the corporation. For all my stays at this location never did I recieve any discounts for future stays. Not much to do in the area compared to old San Juan and Condado. Cabs are twent dollars to Old San Juan. I do recomend this hotel for first timers to Isla Verde.

<Content>Great...once again!! This is my second time staying at the Intercontinental. My family and I stayed there last year. I wrote a positive review about the first time there and things have not changed. We had first planned on staying at the El San Juan this time, but thankfully changed our plans. On our return to the Intercontinental, we saw familiar faces...Bellmen, doormen, front desk, concierge, bar tenders, security, waiters and waitresses and a few managers. They are still friendly, courteous, helpful and pleasant. Ivan the doorman, Andy the bellman, Pablo the front desk manager--all awesome. They remembered us from last year and because of them we will return. The buffet breakfast is delicious and fresh. The rooms are clean and the pool is clean and beautiful. Pool staff are helpful. The airplanes are not a big deal. If the pool bar is a little weak with their drinks, just ask for another one. If you let them know they won't be offended. The only thing I did not like is how certain guests were treated a little more special by management. A lot of brown nosing going on. Its probably the best Hotel in Isla Verde.

<Content>Great Hotel The InterContinental San Juan Resort is a great place to stay. Although I would not recommend to spent your whole vacation there because in PR there is plenty to see. They have a great gym, wonderful spa - ( I actually had the best massage of my life there) and a good steakhouse. It's not far from Old San Juan or the airport.  The rooms are clean and the staff is very helpful. I have not complaints.

<Content>Great experience at the InterContinental My husband and I stayed here April 13 - 17 and were very pleased with the service and accomodations. The staff were friendly and accomodating, greeting us often and cheerfully throughout the hotel. We had a beautiful oceanfront room which was both clean and attractive. The mattress was excellent and we even had a small balcony overlooking the pool. We tried the Italian restaurant for dessert and the bar for lunch and drinks. Another night we had a wonderful meal downstairs at Ruth Chris Steakhouse. Even though the food was expensive, it was no more than I would expect at a first class hotel on the ocean. The location is convenient and we were not bothered at all by the airport nearby. I would highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Nice Overall, but no great value We stayed for an extended weekend as part of a conference/vacation. The pool and grounds were lovely, and the rooms clean and pleasant (if a little small). We were treated well by the staff overall, though some were a little young and inattentive. The pool is gorgeous -- great for kids who enjoy swimming. The beach is lovely as well, and security is quite good. We felt that we could relax and enjoy our time there. We only ate at the restaurant near the beach. The snacks were overpriced and only so-so, though the meals were pretty good and not too expensive. The drinks were expensive and weak, and even the bottled water and sodas were overpriced. Once the conference ended, we felt a bit isolated from shopping -- the shelves at the store across the street were 1/2 empty, and there were only a few fastfood places otherwise. I would recommend going 2 blocks, past the SJ Hotel and Casino, to Gelato Piu for meals and snacks.

<Content>Intercontinental Schmintercontinental Subject: San JuanLocation: San Juan, Puerto Rico, Caribbean, North AmericaTitle: Intercontinental, Schmintercontinental - don't deal with them!ID#: 14870951We didn't actually stay there, but had a problem with a cancelled reservation. They've been giving me the run around for a couple of months and have charged my credit card nearly $900 for three rooms. They give me a song-and-dance, then don't follow through. They don't return phone calls, and pass the buck to another manager. I will be contacting corporate next, then if that doesn't work, the Better Business Bureau, and other consumer advocates, along with the tourism bureaus in San Juan. I will not stay at that particular hotel at any cost. If corporates don't help me, I will swear off any Intercontinental hotels, or any hotels affiliated with them. Too many other very nice hotels, large and small, to recommend this place that won't even try to resolve a matter without threats. Go somewhere else!!! If you stay and have a problem, I would venture to say it would not be resolved by their local management!

<Content>Great Service!! The service at this hotel is phenomenal. Every time you call and ask for something (e.g. extra shampoo, toothpaste, etc.) they not only bring it right up, they call your room to make sure you received the item and it is exactly what you wanted. I was very impressed!

<Content>Had a Fabulous Time! My girlfriends and I, 8 of us total, had a fabulous stay at the Intercontinental! We initially booked at the El San Juan next door, but because of bad reviews decided to swap hotels and book here. It really turned out for the better. We had 2 of the standard rooms (no ocean view) and the rooms were quite spacious. The best part of this hotel is the pool area and the beach. They are both beautiful. We stayed from Thursday - Sunday and most days didn't get to the pool until 11am or noon. We had no problem finding chairs for all of us and there were plenty of options for shade and sun. We enjoyed the casino area... the dealers were much more friendly than at the El San Juan Hotel and the minimums were also lower at the tables. We did go to to the El San Juan club Brava for one night and had fun, but most of our time was spent at the Intercontinental.There is a small grocery store across the street and a few fast food options. We ate at Mi Casita across the street and the food was good. Overall, a great trip! Would definitely return to this hotel in the future.

<Content>Nice Hotel. Not so great location We paid full price so value wasn't there for us. One night precruise. Beach and pool area were quite beautiful. Service was outstanding. Security at the beach was great. Food a bit overpriced but very enjoyable so thats ok. wound up spending $777 for one night stay with two lunches for family. There is one thing you really really need to know. Since I am a priority club member got a beautiful ocean front room. However, El San Juan next door has an outdoor club with full blown Dj playing way into the late night hours. Was ok for the one night precruise. Didn't get to sleep until about 2. Mean while airport is on other side of hotel. I wouldn't want to go through a week there. Ask if it is every night or just on Sat.

<Content>perfect start to our vacation booked one night pre cruise, great deal thru priceline. arrived by noon on saturday (cruise not until 10 pm. sunday). (Taxi was about $25 for two of us (four pieces of luggage) Hotel offered to store luggage while we changed into bathing suits and got two chairs by the pool. (chairs are difficult to find on a busy weekend). we had lunch poolside, very expensive, but we knew that before we decided to eat there). our room was ready by 3, we tossed our things there and headed to the beach. the room was very nice and overlooking the ocean and pool. I was surprized considering our price we paid thru priceline. there is everything in walking distance, walgreens, supermarket, resturants, outback, all the fast food places, a couple of breakfast places across the street. We walked to a wonderful italian rooftop resturant ontop of howard johnsons. the area does get seedy down in that part of town.if you are a priority member they let you stay in your room until 2. which was great for us. once you leave your room either at noon or 2, you can get a hospitality suite for 30 minutes in order to clean up should you want to spend the entire day at the hotel/beach. they give you a wrist band each day for use of the pool/beach and towels, etc. i would highly recommend it. oh and the el san juan is right next door which has an active nightclub. I'd go back.

<Content>great stay Stayed at the Intercontinental for 6 nights with 2 teenage kids. I would recommend the hotel. The beach was great, soft sand and a long beach perfect for walks. The pool was also very nice but we spent most of our time on the beach. All of the staff were very nice and helpful. Ate at the beachfront rest almost every day and was good beach/pool food. Also ate at Ruth Chris steak house and was best steak we had ever had. Only rest we did not eat at was the Japanese rest. All were good. We went do El Yunque rainforest on day and hiked the waterfall trail and then went to Luquillo beach, would highly recommend both. Also spent one afternoon in Old San Juan and went to El Morro and walked around downtown, was also a great exp.Stayed on the 14th floor, great ocean view, newly ren room, flat screen, ect., bathroom was a little small but can't have everything.Would stay here again.

<Content>Great spring break getaway for family We found the hotel to be just what the doctor ordered...our trip away from cold Ky. was much needed! The staff was fabulous - from our first moment of getting out of the taxi, until the moment we got back in a taxi to the airport. In fact - at check in, we were upgraded to an ocean view room - when we had booked a garden view room. We were booked for a Triple A room rate, too. I didn't even ask for the upgrade, it was just offered to us. My one thought was - at the time of booking I thought to enter my Priority Membership Card since the Intercontinenal is part of that family of hotels. I'm not in it for the points, but I've heard that sometimes you can get upgraded to a better floor or get some better amenities with just being a member (and membership is free). So...maybe just having that member number on the reservation helped. Who knows. Anyway - the view was GREAT. Pool was FABULOUS. Our 7 year old couldn't get enough! Food at hotel IS expensive. However - if you want to splurge - the Japanese restaurant is good and a hit with kids. The Ruth's Chris steakhouse is also excellent. There is a bakery across the street that has cheap breakfast - like bagels and pancakes. Also , Mi Casita, a Puerto Rican restaurant across the street, is a nice alternative. Not totally cheap - but better priced than the hotel. Go to Walgreens down the street for snacks/groceries. You can put stuff in the in-room fridge for b'fast (we did). There's a subway across the street - and Domino's pizza. Pizza Hut is nearby as is Wendy's. We HIGHLY recommend a tour to the Rain Forest. We booked it through the concierge the day before - and it was well worth it. Again - the hotel was wonderful for our needs. Room was clean, not totally fashionable - but beds were comfy. All other parts of the hotel were beautiful. I felt extremely safe - and felt comfortable with my 7 year old running around the pool. The staff could not have been nicer. We plan to return to Puerto Rico, and if we return to the San Juan - we would definitely stay at the Intercontinental again. Flight note: if you fly Delta - we found out you can change your flight time on the same day for just $50 per ticket if you call within 3 hours of the flight you would like to take (if there is space). We were able to take an earlier flight from home and get an extra half day in the sun. By doing this we didn't have to pay a full ticket change fee or pay new charges on a new ticket.

<Content>****Not at all a Ritz Carlton We just returned from the resort, As I read reviews I can't believethat someone would compare this to the Ritz Carlton. First of allthe Ritz gave you fresh ice everday, had a full refrigerator, cleaned the room 2 times daily, Finally had a bathroom the size of the guest room we were in. The place needs to be upgraded the chairs in the lobby bar had tears in them, the doors were constanley covered with finger prints and a ton of young people (employees) just hanging out on the front steps. So, if you ever stayed in a Ritz Carlton then you will know there is no comparsion.

<Content>Great Hotel! Just back from a great stay at the Intercontinental (March 25 - 28). I used this website extensively when I planned this trip and was nervous based on some of the reviews. Our stay was just perfect. I was traveling with my husband and two teenage sons. We had a beautiful ocean view room on the 10th floor. The room was nice, spacious, and clean. The view from the small balcony was great. We ate at Alfredo's in the hotel one night and the food was very good and same price as you would pay at any nice restaurant. The pool are was beautiful, and the beach was great. The area around the hotel is safe and there are many other dining options nearby. Don't hesitate to stay at this beautiful hotel!

<Content>Juice is Not Worth the Squeeze First, If you book through hotwire or one of the like and get a discount rate, you will get a discount room with a discount view. We booked an ocean view and can barely see it. What we can see is the ugly roof of the lobby. Pleasant. The management staff is horrible. Not helpful when you have a problem. We had a problem with the in room movies and when they sent tecs to look at it they could not speak english. We called the manager and asked them to send someone that did. They sent someone else but his english was so limited he could only speak a few words of english. I understand we are in puerto rico but this is supposed to be a world class hotel. The manager got upset when i called him back and said what do you expect, we speak spanish here. Wow, thats insightful. The restaurants are way way way over priced. Ruth Chris' is ok but you can get a better steak at any of the restaurants in Old San Juan. The bar charges 11.00 for a scotch and water. The pool side restaurant charges more for a sandwich. Overall we loved puerto rico but wish we would have stayed elsewhere.

<Content>The Worst Customer Service! We stayed at the Intercontinental for a bachelorette party for the weekend of March 14th. We picked this hotel because of the great reviews. I know everyone鈥檚 experiences are different, so I thought I should share mine. The Intercontinental was overall an okay looking hotel, nothing special. The service on the other hand was terrible. From the moment we got there to check in at the front desk we were given attitude, especially by Barbara (who we always some how had to deal) She seemed bothered by everything and looked at us as if we were asking her for stuff that didn鈥檛 have to do with her job!One of the worst things about the hotel, are the elevators. You could hear everyone who were staying at the hotel complain constantly about how long they took! 15-20 minutes to just go up to your room is unacceptable.. and when they finally did arrive, they would be so packed with guests that you had to squeeze in.. People in the elevator always tried to make room because there was an understanding that no one wanted to wait another 20 minutes for the next elevator! Something to note.. Check out is at 12pm.. and although they don鈥檛 tell you this till after.. they will deactivate your keys at 12pm sharp.. even if you have requested a late check out. So something to be aware of.The Pool area was definitely the highlight of this hotel. There were always chairs available and the pool wait staff was great, thanks especially to Javier  Wilmer!When I go away, even if its for a long weekend.. its because I want to relax and feel calm. Anytime we had to deal with the hotel employees, they were rude, abrupt and unhelpful or just took forever to do anything. I believe they need to be retrained in Customer Service.So.. in my opinion, the Intercontinental Hotel chain tends to mean you are getting a good quality hotel with great service.. Don鈥檛 be fooled by the name鈥?The San Juan Intercontinental is not like any of the other Intercontinental鈥檚 I have ever stayed at. For the price.. I recommend going somewhere else.

<Content>Good Weekend Getaway My wife and I travel to the Caribbean 2-3 times per year and we enjoyed our first stay at the Intercontinental San Juan.We thought the ease of flying domestic with self service check in was a large benefit and the hotel is only 5 minutes from the airport. You can definately hear the planes but they do bother you when you are pool or beach side.We had a club level room which we liked as you have your own personal deck and chairs poolside and the club level provides breakfast and a cocktail time everynight.Everyone was very nice and service was great. We spent most of our time at the beach which was never over crowded and you never had to fight for chairs at the pool.The pool bar was very nice with very good food. Food prices are high compared to most other resorts.We ate at Ruth Chris Steakhouse and Alfredo's at the hotel which were good. We went off-site to Marmalade's which was overpriced, slow service, and small portions. We had a good meal at Pamela's which was oceanside.We would recommend this hotel for couples looking to get some beach and pool time. Kids would like the beach and pool but there are no other kids activities on site.Casino was smaller than average but had everything needed to have some low key gambling fun.Overall we would recommend this resort if you are looking for some quality beach and pool time and really do not want to go far from the resort.

<Content>INTERCONTINENTAL SAN JUAN,PUERTO RICO My husband and I stayed at the Intercontinental for our honeymoon in May 2007for 10 days and it was absoluteley beautiful and gorgeous with excellent service and it was clean.We will go again every year because we know what we will look forward to when we go.Everything was to our liking,the views overlooking the pool and ocean were breathtaking and we enjoyed ourselves so much we didnt even go off grounds except to try differnt restaurants outside as well as on the premises., which were very good also. You will not be disappointed. The only thing that was a drawback were the tiny flys they have but if you use the off spray you were fine. As a whole it is a great place to be and return to.

<Content>Beautiful Resort.....Great Beach I did alot of research on mytripadvisor...so I feel strongly about sharing our experience. The Intercontinental is wonderful...on par with a Ritz Carlton. Our room had a beautiful ocean view and new furnishings. Service and staff were excellent. Property grounds are meticulously kept ...pool area is beautiful and lush. The beach is great with just enough surf to keep kids interested. Casino on the property is lackluster...but if you want the glintz of Vegas the El San Juan is right next store. We actually preferred the relaxed, island feel of the Intercontinental though. We used the pool restaurants for lunch...they were very good and resort priced. We had breakfast across the street at Mi casita....very reasonable and good. Breakfast for four is around $30...compared to $22 per person at the hotel. We dined outside the resort for dinner...Barachino's is about a fifteen minute walk...excellent island food VERY friendly staff. We also tried Aijji Modito in Condado despite good reviews the food was OK...we found out after they changed management about a month ago. By far the best Puerto Rican fare was at Raices in Old San Juan....large portions...delicious. Plus, the atmosphere is fun all the staff dresses in traditional island costume. We also dined at The Parrot Club in Old San Juan which was very good...The Dragon Fly ,which is run by the same owner, is asian infused...but is more of a tapis bar than restaurant. Plates are small and to share. Its a good option if you want to eat lighter...island fare can be heavy. Try the duck nachos... In terms of siteseeing, we loved the location of the hotel....being 15 to the airport was great. We went to Old San Juan every night...we rented a car...about a 15 min drive. Parking lots were accessible and a mere $3 for the day. The forts are interesting with beautiful vistas. We went to Baccardi by car...but wouldn't waste your time...you do NOT tour the actual factory anymore...its a short movie and some displays. The Rain Forest is a great trip for kids....loved swimming in the falls. While there we also went to Luquillo Beach which is a beautiful beach, but if your staying in Isle Verde, the hotel beach is nicer with more amenties..so you might want to skip it. We did eat lunch at the kioskis...its their version of road side fast food... alot of fried fritter type food. The people of PR were wonderful and friendly. If you are a staying more than three days definitely rent a car. One word of caution, the drivers in PR are typical city drivers no worse than any New Yorker . But the roadways are not easy to navigate as their road signs are mininal/missing...none of the major atttractions had road signs!!!! The conceirge will give you printed directions..but often they were vague or inaccurate. If you get lost ,and you will, you can call the Conceirge for help. Be sure you have a charged cellphone.We loved the Intercontinenal and would definately return.

<Content>Great Price, Beach, Pool and Casino The hotel is a short taxi ride from the airport. It is not far from the airport, but that should not be a concern at all. The beach at the hotel is great as is the pool and hot tub. The pool is beautiful and the hot tub is huge. You can get a drink while swimming in the pool. The outside caf茅 is great for lunch. The Japanese restaurant is great for great reasonable sushi. The people in the sushi restaurant are very nice too. The excursions you can book at the concierge are over priced. The exercise room is great if you want to work out. There is an Avis rent a car facility located in the lobby. Rented a car for one day for $50.00. The Avis rent a car lady was very helpful. We used the car rental to go to the rain forest and then drove to a beautiful beach where we went snorkeling.The casino is nice, HINT: go to the casino during the day and afternoon for $5.00 blackjack tables, otherwise you will never get a $5.00 blackjack table. In the evening there are mostly $10.00 and $25.00 tables. Only complaint was the soft bed, but I must admit the fresh air in Puerto Rico exhausted me so I had no trouble sleeping.

<Content>Fantastic service Loved the Intercontinental. Traveled with friends and we had a great time. The restaurants and drinks by the pool are expensive, but there are other options. Plenty of great restaurants nearby (Metropol-really good) and a grocery across the street. With refrigerators in the room it was easy to buy and bring back to the hotel. People could not have been nicer. The only problem we had (4 star instead of 5) was that we were told that there was a hospitality suite we could use since our flight was not until 6, but they never told us until we got the key that you only have 30 min. For one person fine but for all of us it was a little rushed. I get it but they should have warned us and we could have split up. Will definitely return to San Juan and would stay at the Intercontinental again.

<Content>Excellent Beach Front Hotel This is the third time I have stayed at the Hotel and the second review I have written. Standard of the hotel is great. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Club Rooms which are poolside and although they lack a view are well worth it. The rooms are bigger than the Standard Ocean view rooms and come with your own small private terrace. As with all Puerto Rico service is a mixed bag. The bellboys were great and one of the hosts in the Club room could not do enough but her boss looks at guests who use the 'cocktail hour' as if they are doing something wrong. She does not help or even ask if customers are having a nice time. Standard of everything is great but the overall experience is a little dated as the hotel was built a while back. I would go back again for a relaxing stay with easy access to the airport and a great weekend away.

<Content>Great for Business  I have stayed here for business quite often over the past few years (and a few times for pleasure) and finally had to write a review. This place has definitely made some great improvements. While the service has always been excellent, the facilities are now up to par for an Intercontinental. As others have noted, the hotel has gone through some major renovations and is now a top-notch resort.Again, the service here has always been excellent. I feel like I'm walking into Cheers every time I step through the front door (OK, I stay here very often). There are too many names to mention but Lorna Mendez has always taken good care of me! This is a great hotel for business travelers as it is very close to the airport (it is not that loud) and has every amenity a business traveler could want, including a nice business center and fitness center.I have also taken my family here a few times for pleasure and was never disappointed. The last time I took my wife here a few months ago and we had a great time - so great that she wants to come back for her big XXth birthday. I told her she could go anywhere (within reason) but she wanted to come back here. The grounds are fabulous and it is right on a beautiful beach. Yes, food and drink may be a bit pricey but you are at a very nice resort and the food is excellent. If you are on a tight budget there is always Motel 6. I would rather splurge on a single stay here than a couple of stays at a budget motel.There are plenty of reasonable dining options within a short walk or ride. Nearby is Lupis, Mi Casita, Metropol, Outback and a Chili鈥檚 is opening soon. Old San Juan is loaded with fabulous restaurants (Aguaviva 鈥?best ceviche!, Parrot Club, Dragonfly, Tamarind, Tantra) as well as shops, historical sights, etc. There are also some great restaurants between the hotel and Old San Juan. Some of my favorites are Ropa Vieja, Pamela鈥檚 (tables on the beach!), Ajili Mojili, Che鈥檚, Atlantica, Steak  Co. and Casa Dante to name a few. Also you must try Soleil Beach Club in Pinones, an open-air place right on the water with fabulously fresh seafood.An overall great hotel for business and pleasure and great city!

<Content>Great Hotel...very friendly staff! We recently stayed at the Intercontinental for my father in law's 60th birthday party. We asked for an upgrade for the birthday boy and they gave us a Suite for no extra cost. The staff was really friendly, starting with the lady at the front desk and throughout the rest of the property. The rooms were nice and well kept, the beach was the cleanest of all the beach spots around. I liked the Casino at the El San Juan better than the IC but the dealers were friendlier at the IC. In all we had a great time and will def return for another stay. Tip...the El San Juan next door has a really nice nightclub, get there early on a Sat night and they have a cool roof top bar as well.

<Content>A good hotel Most of the reviews we read were right on:Hotel: Only a 5-10 minute cab ride from the airport ($11 fare). The lobby and pool are very nice. The beach is nice, but the water did have some seaweed so if that bothers you might consider a different area/island. Never had a problem getting a lounge chair at the pool or beach. The walls are thin and the doors to each room tend to slam when they close. The sound of the airplanes didn't bother us. We thought the concierge people were friendly and very helpful. The casino is small but still enjoyable.Food: Ma Casita was good, reasonably priced breakfast and dinner food. We were not impressed with the breakfast at Alfredo's (in the hotel), especially at $22 per person. The Japenese restaurant at the hotel was okay. We went into Old San Juan twice (we loved it there; $19 cab fare each way - hint: you can share a cab with other hotel guests who are going into Old San Juan to save a little money) and ate at the Puerto Rico Cafe - a cheesy name but very good authentic Puerto Rican food. We went next door to the El San Juan Hotel for dinner and gambling one night - we ate at The Ranch at the top of the hotel - very good food and great views of San Juan and the water. Local attractions: El San Juan hotel has a Vegas atmosphere whereas the Intercontinental was quiet and relaxed (which we appreciated). We rented a car through the hotel (about $35 for the day) and went to Loquillo Beach one afternoon - much larger beach and calmer water but we recommend going during the week if you can (apparently gets crowded during the weekends). Taco Stand #2 at Loquillo is FANTASTIC - it was recommended to us by our concierge. That morning, we went to El Yunque Rainforest and did some hiking - very good waterfall, scenic views, etc.All in all a very pleasant and relaxing trip. There are definitely nicer places/beaches to visit in the Carribean, so we might not be back to Puerto Rico for some time but we're glad we checked it out.

<Content>another wonderful stay My husband had I had the pleasure of being the guest of the San Juan Intercontinental from February 3-7, 2008. This was our third stay at this property in the last two years. I am pleased to write that the hotel is continuing to upgrade and take care of their facililties. The rooms have all been redone with lovely colors, new furniture, and flat screen tv's. The gym, while small, has new equipment. The old latice work is down with new ones in its place. The pool area that has been redone for a little over a year is still beautifuls and the landscape has grown in nicely. The staff (many of whom I recognize from the previous stays) are all polite and efficient. I think this is a wonderful hotel, with wonderful employees. It is the perfect place to relax and enjoy a long weekend.

<Content>Fantastic Getaway My husband and I just returned from a four day getaway and found the hotel to be nothing short of fantastic. From the moment our cab arrived at the hotel, the staff was extremely attentive and catered to our every need. We arrived at the hotel at 10 AM and check in was to be at 4pm, but our room was ready the second we arrived. 16th floor, ocean view, the most gorgeous sight of the pool area and behind that, the ocean. Our room was above our expectations..flat screen tv, new clean furniture, updated clean bathroom with a separate vanity area. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable. We went down for lunch at the outside cafe on the beach. We had a very nice meal with a very attentive and polite waitress.my husband had a burger and fries with a coke and I had a chicken quesadilla with an iced tea and the bill came to $30. We found the prices to be reasonable for a resort. After dinner that night we went to the lively lobby bar to have a drink. We then took a walk around the lush landscaped pool area and then down to the boardwalk by the ocean. ( very romantic) For the rest of the evening we went to the casino with many slot machines and various card tables. The casino is beautiful and the waiters/ waitresses were extremely attentive.  The next morning we enjoyed an excellent buffet breakfast on the lower level of the hotel which had everything you could possibly want. (you can order ala carte as well) The waiter was attentive and catered to our every need.  Afterwards we visted Old San Juan. We toured the fort, which was a very interesting step back into the islands history. We then spent the rest of the day walking around town. There were charming old style restaurants and cafe as well as modern places such as Starbucks. There were outlets store for great shopping. The following day we relaxed by the pool and found there to be an ample amount of lounge chairs and cabanas with a good amount in the sun as well as the shade.  Every evening we were there, we went to the casino and walked around the grounds and overall we found this hotel to be one of the nicest we ever stayed at. The staff is polite, helpful and attentive. Whether you are looking for a place to just kick back and relax or to find some fun and excitement, the Intercontinental Hotel is the place to stay.

<Content>Pricey Hotel - Horrid Guests We chose the San Juan Intercontinental for the last four days of our 10-day trip to Puerto Rico. The rest of the trip was spent at serene, out-of -the-way sort of places in Puerto Rico, so we were thoroughly rested and recharged when we arrived at this hotel. The people at the front desk are very well-trained and polite. We were a tad early and our room wasn't ready, so the bellman took our bags and we went out to the beach-side deck for burgers. When we got to our room an hour later, it was lovely. We had a 12th floor room with an ocean view. Outstanding! My only complaint was thatthe double beds seemed small for two people. There would have been enough room for slightly larger beds, I think. All the other room amenities were very nice.This otherwise lovely property was overrun by rude, arrogant, loud people from a certain East Coast major metropolitan area for the long MLK holiday weekend. They were their usual loud, pushy, obnoxious selves all weekend. Those people were on their Blackberrys and cell phones constantly, everywhere you went, including the pool area, so it was really difficult to relax. I could just feel my blood pressure going up. Several men even smoked cigars by the pool. I was disgusted by this. Who wants to smell that instead of the fresh sea breeze?It was really hard to move to another lounge chair, too, since it was extremely crowded and difficult to find a seat in the first place. Then, when I did find another seat that appeared free, some jerk pushed all my stuff on to the ground while I was swimming. Complaints to the staff elicited little more than shrugs. Later that evening, I went out on my hotel balcony, only to find a man on the balcony below and to the right completely nude and showing himself off to a cheering woman on the patio below. Revolting and low class (more of our countrymen from a certain major East Coast city). The pool is really nice (except they allow smoking anywhere), the beach was nice, too, but the water was full of seaweed. The food and drinks are very high-priced, but I knew this going in, so I sucked it up. I paid $23 for a very tasty quesadilla and Diet Coke. They add the15% tip right into the bill, so just be aware. We had a rental car andknow our way around San Juan pretty well, so we chose to take most of our meals off the property. The valet men were quick and efficient. Noproblems there. The other thing they get you with is one of those stupid resort charges of about $50 per night, so make sure you add that (and about another $50 in taxes) to whatever room rate you find online. Do not befooled!!!This hotel is very close to the airport. This is good and bad. Good because it takes no time at all to get your rental car returned at to the airport, but bad because you can hear jets taking off all day. Notthat big a deal, just something to know before you go. All in all, this was a lovely property with friendly staff, but I doubt we will ever go back. It's perfect for the loud, obnoxious city types requiring every luxury and used to paying exorbitant prices for everything, or for people who want to go to Puerto Rico but are too scared (which is silly) to venture outside of a resort. We'll be looking for something much less crowded, where quiet and solitude are more possible on our next trip.Lastly, we are Priority Club members, but we had no idea that Intercontinental hotels pay Priority Club points at a much lower rate than standard Holidays Inns. We actually received more points for a short stay in a Holiday Inn in Ponce than for our longer, far more expensive stay at the Intercontinental. Frankly, we felt a little ripped off about that.

<Content>great hotel We just came back for a three night stay during the San Sebastian festival. Every hotel room was booked. We originally were booked in the El San Juan Hotel and CAsino through a Jet Blue Package. Jet Blue called us two days before we were ready to leave to say that the hotel overbooked and we had no room. WE were desperate. We spent 5 hours calling every hotel. We lucked out and booked two rooms, oceanfront at the Intercontinental and were very happy with the hotel. The location was great, the rooms were very nice and clean. The casino was good. All the staff were so very friendly and helpful. Even though all the rooms were booked the hotel did not seem crowded. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would return. The only small problem was that there was not much choice for breakfast. There was only one restuarant for breakfast. Also, the hotel is not lively, very quiet with a nice lobby bar and band.

<Content>Paid a fee to leave Booked this hotel based on Intercontinental name and reviews online. The room was dirty, the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom was small and very dated. It just wasn't what I have come to expect from an intercontinental. I have had nicer rooms at Hampton Inns. The only restaurant at the hotel that I would reccommend was the Ruth Chris. We were suppose to stay 4 nights but left after 2 and checked into a different hotel. They charged and extra fee of $100 to leave early. That should have been a red flag that the hotel was not up to par. I will be contacting the Intercontinental chain to complain also. They should be ashamed to put their name on this hotel.

<Content>Gorgeous Property, Had Some Problems My husband and I stayed here because we had such a lovely time at the Intercontinental on Cozumel Island, and we were planning to visit Puerto Rico. We stayed in a special wing of the hotel - I think they call them Club Rooms or something similar. My husband travels for work frequently so we tend to gravitate toward the Intercontinental chain since we know they are reliable. This hotel absolutely had some service problems, but the property itself is absolutely lush, and the pool is gorgeous.We were in Puerto Rico for 5 nights. During our trip, we left for a night and stayed at El Conquistador (about an hour away), and actually wished we had been there the whole time. It was amazing. Our room included access to a special club room that included a concierge, a continental breakfast buffet, and wine and appetizers in the evening. My husband and I were repeatedly struck by the lack of service given by the concierges. The woman in charge (older, distinguished-looking) never remembered us, and constantly asked us which room we were in to confirm we were allowed to be there. The other staff members didn't even glance up when we walked in, even to greet us. It was pretty surprising, considering that this club room was supposed to give us an extra level of service. After a day of receiving little help from the staff in the special club room, we decided to try the regular concierge. We encountered a young 20-something woman with a whole lotta attitude! We asked her for some snorkeling advice, and she was borderline hostile, obviously irritated with her job/life/something. She told us we were in the wrong part of the island and we should have stayed somewhere else! Very funny, considering the concierge is the ambassador to the island to all tourists. We complained to the hotel manager, and they were very kind, sending gifts to our room and calling us to apologize.I can go on and on but I'll stop here. In a nutshell, if you are a business traveler looking for a nice hotel for some pool relaxation - go for it! If you are on vacation, you'll certainly want to look elsewhere. This hotel caters to business folks.

<Content>Fabulous! Chose the Intercontinental for a post-Christmas trip (we got a last-minute air and hotel package via AmericanExpress.com) and were very happy with the hotel--I highly recommend it if you're headed to SJ and it's within your budget. (We probably wouldn't have stayed here if paying full price...but for the price we got online it was phenomenal!)First--the hotel's in a fabulous location. It's a $12 cab ride to the airport, and $19 to Old San Juan. Taxis are readily available. There are a few restaurants across the street (Burger King, Church's Chicken, Subway, and La Casita for Mexican food), as well as a small grocery store. There's a Walgreen's within about a ten minute walk.Check-in was speedy. On arrival, we asked if any oceanview rooms were available and were told it'd be an extra $80/night (when we'd checked online before leaving home, it'd been higher.) We paid for the upgrade and were VERY happy with the room...14th floor with a great view of the pool, ocean, etc. The pool and beach are very clean, and we had no trouble finding lounge chairs. The hotel provides you with nice fluffy towels just as you're entering the pool area, which is very convenient. In our room, the beds were only mediocre, but everything else was so good it wasn't a big deal. There was even better-than-expected toiletries and the water pressure in the shower was great.The hotel was clean and the staff very attentive. We had to wait a couple times for the concierge, but she was helpful and informative about day trips, restaurants, etc. They have a computer next to the concierge desk that allows hotel guests to search for restaurants, activities, etc. all over Puerto Rico. It was very handy...even lets you see restaurant menus. We booked an all-day excursion via the concierge desk that took us to El Yunque, Luquillo Beach, and on a nighttime kayak ride to the bioluminescent bay in Fajardo. It was pricey, but well worth every penny. (The kayak ride in particular was phenomenal!) I was worried the kids (ages 6 and 9) wouldn't be able to go all day, and that the kayak might be too much, but they did fine and would do it all again. The tour guide the hotel uses, Joey, was fabulous and pointed out all kinds of things to the kids (even found them a coqui!) and made food suggestions to keep them happy. I also splurged and got a massage at the spa at the Intercontinental--VERY good massage, though not cheap! If you want to save $$, do NOT order at the pool bar. Drinks are very, very pricey. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants other than at the outdoor cafe. A pizza there is $14. It looks like it's for one, but it's probably enough for two people (we had a LOT left over...could have saved $$$.) The food was very good, however, so no regrets! If you can book the Intercontinental the way we did (on a last minute deal) and save $$$, do it! The service was phenomenal, as was the hotel's location.

<Content>Great Hotel!!!!!! We just returned and spent x-mass there the staff was the nicest we have ever seen the food, accommodation's we excellent. The Pool and beach we tremendous. If you are on any kind of budget then do not eat pool side or drink pool side. Cokes $4.00 I ordered a Vodka  tonic atthe swim up bar $15.00 + tip WOW!!! Plenty of good eats close by and buy your waters etc..across the street at the local store. Very easy to get to only 1 mile from airport.

<Content>My Ocean View ROCKS! Disclaimer: i'm 25 and a newlywed, so half the thrill of my vacation is being away with my husband of seven months, and I would be happy if I were to arrive at a much less classy hotel, as long as I have my bikini, a book, and the beach. I'm traveling with my husband and his parents and his brother and wife, so I didn't book the trip and I'm not paying for anything. So I won't talk about the prices much. I do know that it is expensive, though. My in-laws are, well, wealthy, and this is their 5th time here. They come for Christmas every year (the place is filled with Jews from Long Island and New Jersey this time of year, which is funny. We flew all this way, and it's like being back home. They spotted a friend from Temple at the pool!)That said, this place is gorgeous! They upgraded us to an ocean view, and I love it; the view is breathtaking. The room is really clean and modern, and they have JUST put in brand-new flat screen TVs. They participate in a water saving program, so the sheets are not washed every day, which I appreciate as a green-thinking person. The food is excellent at the poolside bar, but crappy at the restaurant closer to the beach. They're about 50 feet away from each other, but the difference in quality is astounding. The staff is super friendly and the pool-side service is great. They have a cozy jacuzzi and the pool is nice although once the sun goes behind the hotel (around 3 pm) it is unbearably cold! The beach access is convenient, and such a treat. I prefer to go sunbathe all the way to the left, where the locals are hanging out. (To get there, you have to wade through the el San Juan hotel guests... and they are snobby).The wi-fi is spotty, which is making us crazy as both me and the hubby are laptop toting people. there is NO drawer space in here, just three measly drawers that I took, and a closet. Hubbs is living out of his suitcase. Other than that, no complaints!

<Content>Fantastic! Loved it. Would go here gain. Got a great flight + hotel deal out of NYC on Priceline. This hotel is centrally located in Isla Verde which is 10mins from the airport and 20mins from Old San Juan. This really is the best part of town to stay in if you are here for more than 3 days. Else, stay somewhere in Old SJ if visiting for the first time.VERY friendly helpful staff from the moment we stepped out of our taxi. Check-in was a breeze. Great ocean view room included in package. Hotel beach was good. Probably the best in San Juan. We did not eat at the hotel as the options were Japanese and Italian. We wanted traditional food. Great places in Old SJ. Grocery store across the hotel and tons of small restaurants (noting special) and fast food places all around. Good Breakfast bets are the bakery across the street and Mi Casita.We rented a car from the Avis counter at the hotel. The lady there was very very helpful and gave us tons of great tips. The car was not any more expensive then booking online or at a local agency (I checked at Charlie's). Go to her. You'll be happy.Overall, probably the best luxury bet in SJ. The only other hotel we'd consider was the Water Club across the street..

<Content>Great for a quick and affordable getaway Got a tremendous deal for a quick four-nighter with my wife. After reading reviews on Tripadvisor we decided upon the Intercontinental and knew to pay just a bit extra to be guaranteed an ocean-front room, which makes all the difference.Rooms were fairly small but just fine for two people, and the king bed faces out to the ocean, which makes for great morning wake-ups.At times, San Juan felt like a sister city of NYC given how many people have emigrated to NYC from PR. Seemed like everyone we talked to had a relative or friend in NYC, or had been there themselves. Pros: - Great pool- Not too crowded even when full- Good buffet breakfast that didn't get tiring after 4 days- 5 minutes from airport - Just like home: we have many puerto rican acquaintances given that we're from New York City- Neighboring hotels are fun to visit but we were always happy that we were sleeping at the Intercontinental'Cons:- Definitely urban feel, miami beach-like.- Depending on the tides, the ocean and sand may be overcome with seaweed 2 of of our 4 days were like this.Tip: Go to Pamela's on the Beach restaurant at the Numero Uno Guest House for a truly memorable experience.

<Content>Great times at Intercontinental Just got back from 5 days at Intercontinental- we had a wonderful time. Everything was excellent- beautiful pool and beach, great rooms, lovely lobby and bars and a warm, friendly staff. The only restaurant we ate at was the beach cafe- food was good and average priced. The other restaurants at the hotel were very expensive for our tastes. Luckily, the hotel is located within walking distance to many other restaurants. We ate at Lupis, Mi Casita and Outback and they were fine. Walking around felt safe and confortable. We would recommend the tour to the Rain Forest. We loved it, though the walk back from the waterfall is a bit steep and my legs ached the next few days! Took a taxi to Old San Juan and ate at Barachina's- they invented the Pina Colada and they were delicious! We would definitely go back to Intercontinental! Convenient to airport ; you do hear airplanes but was not irritating.

<Content>Would highly recommend Loved it !!! The outside is a little drab from the street but once you enter the resort, it is a different story. The lobby is somewhat small, but ample, the front desk staff are excellent, Katrina (I think was her name) was extremely helpful. We arrived on Saturday morning around 12pm but our room was not ready. We had lunch at the beach side cafe, pizza, burgers and stuff. the price was reflective of a higher end resort, but not too bad. Once we got in the room, it was huge in comparison to most other resorts I looked into. This is a resort to relax in, the one benefit for me was that there were not many, if at all children running around everywhere screaming. Mostly adults just lounging by the pool. The hotel also has it's own private beach area where the porter will place a lounge chair and umbrella where ever you would like. Nice touch.We also loved dealing with Hector at the concierge desk. He booked the Bio Bay tour in Farajdo (spelling?). This is a must if you are there and there is a new moon. This is a once in a life time experience, just be prepared, you have to kayak a good distance to the lagoon. But well worth the exercise. The pool area is great, a decent balance of sun and shaded areas. The pool never seemed over crowded, and chairs were amble. We had lunch at the pool (swim up) bar. I thought it was very reasonable considering it is the Intercontinental. I had the shrimp skewers and it was only $10 bucks. Now a waring, every soda refill cost. I was not used to this considering in the continental US, refills are usually free. Also I had a cocktail and was averaged price for a beach resort. What surprises me, is to read the other reviews and have people thinking that hotels are cheap. If you want cheap, stay at the Holiday Inn. You get what you pay for, and this resort is worth it. While we were there, we also look at other resorts to see about the competition. The property next door, the San Juan Resort and Casino, it is newer and glitzier, but the room are small. I would rather have a large room and comfortable bed than a shinny lobby. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this resort. The Manager Pablo personally introduced himself to us and asked how are stay was going. When was the last time a manager asked, or even cared.

<Content>Disappointing and Overpriced This hotel is way way overrated and overpriced. The bathroom was dated and was in need of a serious facelit. The bathtub was old and shabby looking. Considering what it cost to stay here, so not worth it! We paid for an upgraded, ocean view room and what a disapointment. The view of the ocean was great - if you could take standing out on the the little veranda to enjoy it - which was only about three feet wide! The chairs are placed sideways because they can't fit facing the water!The pool area is nice (though rather small) and looks fairly new. They need to spend some money on the rooms. They were clean but nothing to rave about, again considering the price to stay here. Forget eating or drinking at this hotel. $4 for a small cup of cofee is insane! Thankfully, my husband is from the island so we know where - and where not - to go! If you are a true urbanite, then this is the place to stay. It's on a bustling city street with a lot of people and noise. If not, go elsewhere on the island!Honestly, we would not stay here again - just not worth the price.

<Content>Great Hotel, 1st class service we stayed at this hotel for the first time between 12-15 october. 2007we were upgraded to ocean view room as an ambassador member. great room, very good size and fantastic view.very clean room, good house keeping. no complaints. I know that they are phaving new rooms soon, so I can imagine they should be even great as the old ones are very nice.the view is fantastic. the breakfeast is a must. it wasn't included in our rate but it's worth every cent paid for it, around 23$. so make sure you go there at least once during your stay.we didn't try any of the restaurants or room service as it was mentione dit was overpriced in other reviews.the location itself is nice near to other hotels. next door san juan hotel has bigger reception and casino. and the ritz carlton is very elegant hotel. not sure about the food but we had a drink at the bar. first class service.near by there are all the fast food restaurant like burger king, taco bell etc. also, there are few local restaurants which are average. especially lipis which had loads of great reviews but we were dispointed ( there is another lupis in old san juan as well).taxis to aiport is $11 and to old san juan is $19Old san juan is so beautiful so you should go for sure, loads of restaurants that varies in prices. not much shopping but I was told they had a huge mall which is 19 $ as well but can't remember the name at the moment.before we went we saw on the weather chanels and website that it will rain a lot and other days scattered showers. they lied. only 10 minutes rain in all the 3 days.we'll go back again for sure

<Content>Pretty Nice Hotel was clean. food and drinks very expensive. Found myself running accross the street to Burger King a few times. View from room was great. Nice pool. Concierge was very helpful. The walls seemed a little thin. I could hear what my neighbors were talking about without any effort. The restaurant downstairs is a bit odd. In the morning its a walk in buffet and in the evening its a restaurant with a dress code and its very expensive. I may have bought into that and paid for an outrageously overpriced dinner if i hadn't just eaten bacon and eggs at the same table just a few hours earlier in my bathing suit. Overall I would say it was ok. very nice to look at but once i was there a few days you start to notice the imperfections. $15.00 for a drink at the swim up bar. Muy expensivo my friends. Can't say i didnt enjoy myself but i wouldnt go back.

<Content>Both Bad and Good to Say My stay at the Intercontinental Hotel San Juan was for 2 nights on September 14, 2007, for a pre-cruise stay. I arrrived into San Juan in the late afternoon, took the fixed rate taxi to the hotel, and was greeted warmly by the bell staff as they did each and every time I entered or departed the hotel. I was effeciently and pleasantly checked into my room #1123 by the front desk clerk. This very nice service is what I had remembered from a previous stay at another San Juan hotel, but, unfortunately this is where the friendly service ended at the Intercontinental San Juan. My room, although small, was cheerfully decorated and the bed was fluffy and comfortable with the bottom sheet completely covering the matress. The small balcony overlooked the street area and airport landing traffic (no problem with noise). I immediately noticed that the room contained nice bathroom amenities and plenty of towels, but, none of the usual Room Service Menu/Service Directory/Writing Paper portfolio. The room also had an ironing board but no iron. In calling for these items, I was told that the iron would be sent up but I would have to call the Business Center for the portfolio. Okay fine. Business Center says call Housekeeping, each time being asked, Anything else I can do for you? To me, this is the most frustrating situation with Customer Service. If you haven't been able to fullfill my request, don't ask if you can do anything else. I decided it was not that important to get the portfolio. As it turned out the iron was broken, but, was replaced quickly the next day. After a very long trip, I went to bed early but was awakened by loud voices in the hallway, mistaken phone calls and knocking at the door. After falling asleep again, I was awakened again by the 3 false fire alarms mentioned by a previous review. The next night did go much better with no alarms! My room was made up the second day very promptly after leaving for lunch and the Housekeeping department was quiet and unobtrusive.As mentioned in previous reviews,the beach at the Intercontinental is very nice and the hotel has great service for guests who wish to be served while in the sun. The pool is also very nice and security is tight, making it difficult for anyone who is not a regestered guess to be admitted. The gym is well-equipped, adequately air conditioned,and has a nice view of the beach, and is open 24-hours. The ice machine on my floor worked well and always had plenty of ice.As I stay in hotels about 12 nights a month, I have to say that the young lady at check out gets the award for the worst in the world. She was curt, rude, and did not even offer to show me a list of my charges prior to charging my card. She had no change in cash to accommodate my request for small bills acting as if this was a strange request for a hotel cashier. No thank you's or offers of assistance with bags from her. All of this after waiting 5 minutes for other clerk on duty to finish her personal conversation with a co-worker.All in all, this hotel is quite a blast from the past. I fully expected to see Lucy, Ethel, Fred and Ricky pass through the lobby while on their Puerto Rican Adventure. Truely a place where my Mom and Dad would have spent their honeymoon. Not a bad thing if staff could be brought up-to-date on current standards of service in the hotel industry.

<Content>Not worth the money We stayed here September 07. We stayed 7 days, This resort is far away from any attractions. The room we had needed some updating. The pool and beach areas were nice. This place has more of a hotel feel than a resort. We were overcharged about $85. We were awaking three times in the middle of the night by the fire alarm, ( false alarm).There are nicer places to stay for about the same money!

<Content>Island thing to do I am an experienced PR frequenter. (is that a word) Nice older hotel in main strip of Isla Verde San Juan. Direct access to nicer beach on island and nice (older) designer pool. Staff attentive. Check in was ok although I had a jerk and stone faced fool who checked me in at first and told me rom would be ready in 3 hours. I came back 5 minutes later and was helpfully attended by a female clerk who check me in 3 hours before the fool said I could. $10 to airport and cross street from Charlies car Rental. Nice rooms. again older, but clean and SMALL terraces. Casino and small lounge for evening drinks. NOT A PARTY HOTEL. More reserved.Next door at the El San Juan is where the party gets jumping with a club and live music lounge. I hear the service there is bad though, so stay here and walk there for night life. American and Latino Restaurants and small mall across street for all that you forgot back home. Decent cigar shop in mall too.Best Night Club on Island: Next door at El San Juan.Favorite eatery/hangout spot: LUPIS two blocks towards airport. Live bands (top 40 and rock) cheaper booze and food. lots happening through out week and then some.Must do in PR. Visit historical places. MUST do Old San Juan. Castles, Shops, El Convento by nice church and beautiful cooper stone street leading to the door of san Juan. Nice trendy restaurants all over 2 square miles. BEST IS DRAGON FLY. Packed. ASK FOR CEASAR. Tell him Elias sent ya.Other things: For nicer beaches, golf and great hotels to visit PLUS good eats visit FAJARDO. Half hour away but totaly different sceen. Not to mention the famous rain forest near by. Easy car ride away BUT drive with eyes behind your head. BAD drivers all over.FOR THE ADVENTURERS AND ISLAND CURIOUS: Rent a car. Travel towards the east coast line pass Pinones to Canovanas then towards Fajardo. You have rainforest and Luquillo beach here. Visit all in between (beaches and eaterys)and take a boat over to Vieges or other small island from ferry landing in Fajardo and see what a beach should be. Come back and go to Ponce historical city with beautiful buildings, famous fire house and such. Travel west to Aquadilla. boat and beach town. take a short drive from there and visit LARES' center city for a look at the older ways and good ice cream of 100 different flavors. In between on main rode to Lares visit the hidin Caves of Camuey. Drive back east and stop at Arecibo and take a view from the highest point on island. Work your way back east and visit the Bacardi rum factory. Drive to old San Juan and do the walking sites mentioned above. This would take a full day if you skip the ferry to islands. Two days with the ferry to island included.Good luck and enjoy the Island.

<Content>Best resort on isle verde Loved this resort! Had a great vacation. The intercontinental in our opinion was the best in the area. We walked to ESJ and the Ritz and we were happy we chose the intercontinental! Great pool area and beach. Like other reviews have stated food is very expensive at the resorts. We only ate once at the resort and we chose the japanese rest. ($100 for the two of us) It was just average in my opinion. One tip bring your own drinks to the pool area, they charged us $3 for a small cup of coke and $3 for a cup of water. Booked a snorkel trip on the Barefoot cat. in Fajardo and had a great day! When we return to San Juan we will definitly stay here again!

<Content>shameful I was embarrassed by security on my 3rd day there in the main lobby questioning whether I was a guest or not. Personally I feel as though I was profiled as being a local and just wanting to use the facilities, and not being a guest since I am hispanic. When i advised the concierge of this no concern or empathy was shown or given. This may not affect anyone's decision about this hotel but be weary of there practices.

<Content>Less then stellar Expensive for what you get. Could not check into until after 4 pm, had to sit in lobby until then and then I still had to go to concierge in order to obtain room.Rooms are small, bathroom is tight, had 3 shampoos on counter when checking in no other products until 3rd day. Cleaning staff left dirty towels in room. did not vacum daily.Air conditioner leaked, but hotel did fix quicklyPrices at bar ridiculous 15 dollars for a martini?Unable to rent movies on tv, channel was too fuzzy.

<Content>Just another Hotel This is just your average hotel. The rooms are a good size, basically clean, but nothing special. We were annoyed to come back from the pool on our first day at 2pm, and found our room not cleaned, with no fresh towels, etc. It shouldn't happen that you have to call to get your room cleaned, it should just be taken care of.Checking in was easy, as it should be.We didn't like on a constant basis that bellhops were riding the elevators with full luggage carts. We even had a bell hop push his way onto an elevator with 10 or so people still needing to use it. Common courtesy is the guests should use the elevator first.The pool was really nice. Clean and well taken care of. Plentyful staff for drinks, with lots of towels and umbrellas in case you didn't want to bake. Would have been nice to have umbrellas for guests on the beach, but couldn't get one.Probably would go back to the Ritz (which is down the street) rather than come here again.

<Content>Would go Again I was there just before Hurricane Dean with two children (14 and 11)A really nice place to stay with just a few problems 鈥?mostly with certain staff. Would I go back? Yes. I really liked it.Pool:Not too big, but full of nooks and crannies for the children to explore. Anyone thinking of swimming laps should go to the beach. Several rocky waterfalls and small pools.Lots of deck chairs with large fluffy towels. Could use more umbrellas 鈥?the sun in Puerto Rico is HOT!Beach:Very close to the hotel. White sand, relatively clear warm water with a little sea weed form time to time. Small waves with not very much current. Nice beach.RestaurantsHaving read that the hotel food was expensive, I always ate outside. But I did notice that the priced menus weren't available before going into the restaurant. Always a sign of high prices. Also, poolside drinks were expensive, but many people brought their own drinks to the pool.Location:Great location. On the beach with numerous cheap or moderately priced restaurants nearby. We liked the Metropole best (a five minute walk) and for lunch the Mi Casita across the road. In the same strip mall as Mi Casita was a Chinese restaurant that was acceptable and a bakery for breakfast. Also across the road are many fast food places, if you can handle that. Also a small grocery across the road.The was airport noise, but we got used to it. Wasn't very loud in the rooms.Front Desk:A mixed bag. The men were usually very helpful and polite. They normally took the time to ask questions to find out what you really needed and offered solutions or alternatives 鈥?always resulting is a satisfactory end. The women could use sensitivity training. The ladies were very business-like and while eventually helpful, not that friendly. I don't remember any of them saying good morning or please or thank you. When checking in at 13:00, I was reminded that check in is a 16:00. I asked for a room on a high floor and was advised that she couldn't guarantee anything until the rooms were clean (RIGHT!) Then having read in Trip Advisor about some rooms that were poorly air-conditioned, I asked about those undesirable rooms and asked her not to give me something that was the subject of complaints. She indicated that if there is a problem to call maintenance and they would fix it. (RIGHT!) She worked on her keyboard and suddenly a room was available on the 15th floor (GREAT!) Strange it wasn't available 2 minutes before. She suggested that I check back later to see if it was ready. When we did, it was ready at 14:00 (GREAT!) While I wouldn't seek this young lady again for help, in fairness, she was efficient 鈥?but being friendly and polite would have given her high marks.Another engagement with the female front desk was over asking for change for a $50 bill. With a great rolling of the eyes she made sure that I knew how inconvenient it was for her. Pulled out different folders and consulted her colleges. At the end she gave me change. But really 鈥?how difficult is it to break a 50? The hotel has a casino, after all.Concierge:The concierge had an A team and a B team. The A team was a man who was very helpful and polite. The B team was a woman who, although polite, was very useful. I was very upset with her one night when my son went downstairs to ask for some matches for a candle, the concierge sent him to the front desk, which sent him into a bar. She sent my 14 year old into a bar! The bar apparently couldn't help him either. So I confronted the concierge and finally a manager gave me some matches. Strangely, the next day I innocently asked the concierge, front desk and bar for matches and they found them right away.Housekeeping.Missed a few things upon occasion, but kept the room very clean. Extra towels were always there and she turned down the beds. Also cleaned the room at the time requested.Curb staff:The bell hops, bag handlers, cab callers were very professional and always helpful. Mostly young guys, the always looked happy, held open doors, greeted gusts. One of the best groups I have seen. Business Centre:Nice facility with reasonable charges. The lady managing the facility was very helpful and made several good suggestions. She knew her stuff. She was also very lovely and I went back several times to use the centre just to talk to her.Room Nice and spacious, but needed to be refreshed. Small balcony that we didn't use. The walls were a bit thin and some nights we could hear people next door or the TV. Normally turning on the air conditioning drowned out the noise.There was a space under the door of the thickness of a bic pen. As a result, all the hallway noise came into the room. I don't know why hotels have these spaces and its one of my pet peeves.TV didn't have all the channels that you would expect this type of hotel to have. Also, there wasn't a listing of the channels available. That would have been helpful

<Content>Best rooms may not be as expensive as you think. I have stayed in both the regular and Club Intercontinental rooms at this property, and I can testify that paying the higher tariff for a Club room is a solid investment. The Club rooms are more spacious (except for the cramped bathrooms) and more recently refubshed than the main rooms and have more spacious balconies overlooking the pool area. Perhaps the greatest benefit and money-saver is the fact that a really fine buffet breakfast is included in the morning, as well as an excellent hors d'oeuvres buffet and open bar in the evening. Just the breakast and cocktail hour make the higher rate sensible, and that doesn't even include the fact that the Club is open all day long for soft drinks and snacks and the level of personal service by the concierge and her staff is superb. Go for it and you'll be glad you did.

<Content>Had a Fantastic time! My wife and daughter stayed at this wonderful hotel from 8/12/07-8/17/07. It was our first vacation in San Juan Puerto Rico, and we absolutely cannot wait to go back! The hotel was everything we had hoped for and more. It's a short cab ride from the airport and we got to the hotel at 2pm. We were immediately greated warmly by several doorman, who unloaded our luggage. You'll never have to open the door to the hotel, both in and out! We originally had booked a room with a garden-view, but it was upgraded to an ocean-view on the 9th floor. The room was nice, with a small balcony. The view at night was awesome, although you did had to get use to the sounds of the many coqui's(tree frogs). At this point any stress you may have just simply melted away.The pool, swim-up bar, and jacuzzi was nice, as well as the many small waterfalls around the pool. It was never crowded, and lounge chairs were plentiful. The beach is right off the resort, and you can have someone assist you with setting up lounge chairs and umbrella. Another person came around and took orders for food and drinks-another great amenity. The food is expensive, but we decided to splurge anyway. We had ate at the resort's Japanese steakhouse, and Alfredo's(opened one week earlier). Again, it is expensive, but the food and service was excellent.We went on two excursion's-the rain forest and horseback riding on the beach. The tour guide on the rain forest was fantastic-his name was Hector, and he took us on side tours on his own. He talked to us on the mic the whole way, giving us a history lesson on Puerto Rico and its people and customs. We visited the Bacardi Rum factory also. We took a cab ride($19)to the ferry in Old San Juan, took the ferry across(I think it was $1.50 round trip), then another cab ride($3) to the distillery. The tour there was for free, and each adult received two tickets to sample free drinks. We went into Old San Juan twice. Calle Fortaleza is the main street where you can find many shops and restaurants. The architect of the old buildings and cobblestone streets takes you back in time. We ate at the Parrot Club, which was recommended by a Cigar shop merchant. You can take a cab to Plaza Colon($19)from the hotel and walk up Calle Fortaleza to Plaza de Armas. There's an area here that you can feed the hundred's of pigeons-it was amazing. An old woman was selling feed for $1, and the pigeons are walking around your feet, waiting to be fed. Lots of folks from the cruise ships frequent the area around Plaza de Armas. You can find the outlet stores here(Coach,etc.), which is located on Calle Cristo street(make a right off Calle Fortaleza)Further up a hill on Calle Cristo(past the Coach outlet store), you will find the El Morro Fortress to the left. For $5 you can visit this fort as well as the San Crist贸bal Fort, which is located behind Plaza Colon. It takes a few hours of exploring one fort. The difference between the two is that El Morro is much higher. All in all, the trip was great(can you tell?), the hotel was super, the people were very nice. We cannot wait to go back!I hope this review helps any future vacationers to this great resort and island.

<Content>Loved the Intercontinental - Alot !!! My family and I (wife, daughter 13 and son 11) just returned from a fabulous vacation. I felt compelled to write this review since we had such a terriffic time. First of all, let me tell you about this awesome property: From the moment we checked in (which took about 5 minutes) untill the time we checked out ( which took about 5 minutes) we had t the time of our lives. The hotel is situated on a beautiful stretch of beach. - Do your homework - if you go to Puerto Rico, you definitely want to stay on Isla Verde. The Intercontinental's beach is by far the best. The pool area is just about the best I've ever seen. The pictures they have online really don't do it justice. This hotel is pricy on food and drinks but don't let that discourage you. We found tons of great places to eat within EASY walking distance and they have a great little store directly across the street where we stocked up on beverages that we put into our little cooler that we took to the pool area as well as the beach without any hassle. We managed to get 2 adult full breakfast buffets included each day. Let me tell you this was the real deal!!! It was wonderful. We ate at the beach side restuarant a couple of times and it was good and not too expensive. For those concerned about being too close to the airport... It never bothered us in the least bit. We had a city view room and yes, we could see the planes landing but it was a total non-issue...The rooms were very clean and nice and we had no issues what-so-ever. I understand they are getting ready to renovate them. Most all of the rest of the hotel has been completely renovated and it is extremly nice. I would rate this hotel about a 4.2 star. This was my first trip to PR and will not be my last. Awesome destination. This is a place where you want to rent a car and go explore. You have to go to the El Yungue Rainforest. Make sure to go to Mina Falls. After you spend the morning and early afternoon there, go to Luquillo Beach. Not the Luquillo Beach park but further down (you'll understand). Also, do the Bioilluninescense close by as well by Kayaks. Also, you really, really have to go to Culebra Island and snorkel and go to Flamenco Beach. WOW... WOW!!!! The Caves on the other side of the island really shouldn't be missed either. The Intercontinental really is a GREAT place... Don't miss out...I read some to of the other reviews and after returning I can only sumize that some people are just nuts. Beautiful, Friendly Place...Happy Traveling!!!

<Content>Great Time This was a family vacation for my husband, 13 year and 6 year old girls, and I. It was a nice trip and the hotel was nice. If you are not a picky person then I would recommend this to you. The beach, pool, room service and rooms were nice. We didn't splurge on the room because we never planned on being there very much. If you get a room with a city view, don't plan on sitting on the balcony. You will be lucky to get one person out there. We were so tired everynight that we never noticed the planes. They did come clean our room everyday and we were there for 5 days. Very nice towels. The staff is helpful but don't count on getting an upgrade to a room. You have to be very lucky and it does not matter how much you tip. The food is high and so so. Your best bet is to walk across the street and chose something from there. Make sure you learn spanish. 4 places that we ate they couldn't understand us, because they didn't know english. MUST DO's El Morro Castle, great history and very cheap trip, Old San Juan was great and lots of great shops. Be prepared to do alot of walking. TAKE A CAB!!!. We went to El Morro  Old San Juan on the same day and we took a cab there and back. Yes it cost $19.00 each way. It only took us 15 minutes to get there and back. There was a nice place to eat at in Old San Juan and great view. It was called Cafe Amapola. Great beans and rice! If you like to really shop then go to the Plaza Del Americus shopping mall. Again it will cost you $19.00 each way and it took us 10-15 minutes to get there. It is worth it unless you have alot of time and patience for a 45minute or longer bus ride. Be prepared to walk. It is 3 levels and I love to shop, but I never seen the 3rd level because I was sick of shopping. You will get lost there. MORE MUST DO'S ---scubba diving, my husband loves it and has been several times. He booked it with CoQui Dive and it was well worth the money and he got 2 dives at 2 different places in the same trip/day. He said it was the best he had ever done or seen. If you want to see the most breathtaking beach you must do the snorkling trip that you can book through the hotel. It is $105.00 per person. REALLY WORTH IT!

<Content>Loved the pool and the beach This hotel is near the airport, but it has a great pool and beach. The staff was very helpful and the room was clean and nice. The down side is the hotel is not conveniently located to tourist attractions. Old San Juan is a 45-minute public bus ride away, although at 75 cents, the trip is a bargain. Any side trips require advanced planning. The food at the hotel, and all the other hotels nearby, is very expensive. If pays to walk around the neighborhood and find other restaurants. Golden Bagel across the street is an excellent alternative to the hotel's way overpriced breakfast. Lupi's down the street offers Mexican cuisine at a reasonable price. Still, the pool and beach provide a terrific and relaxing vacation.

<Content>The Good and the Bad I stayed at this hotel the day before and the day after a cruise I took out of San Juan. During the first stay, they upgraded me to a suite right next to the pool that was a room of the quality you would see on MTV Cribs! This was amazing! I suspect they did this because it was my first stay at an Intercontinental Resort and Holiday Inn wanted me to keep coming back. However, on the second stay, I was in a typical room ... which was nothing special.The hotel has one of the nicest pools with beach entry that you will find on the beachy section of Puerto Rico. There is a nice bar area in the middle where you can sit and have one of the weakest $9 drinks you will ever get. However there are plenty of lounge chairs to lay out on and a nice (but crowded pool.)The hotel room (I am reviewing the standard room here ... if you have the money to get a pool side suite, you will thank yourself as the suite was one of the nicest hotel rooms I've stayed in anywhere) ... had yellowish stucco walls and medditeranian style furniture. It didn't really make me feel comfortable being in there for some reason. There was a balcony that overlooked the street (they were booked up and could not move me to one that overlooked the ocean in the back). The bed was comfortable but the room just lacked style. It felt like one of those cheap Florida condos. The bathroom was small and cheap looking.The location is good if you want to be on the beach. It isn't very glamorous. It reminds me a little of Atlantic City. The casino inside the hotel is small and there are a few good (but very overpriced restaurants). There is a Palm Steakhouse and a Japanese Hibachi style restaurant. The area around the hotel is pretty run down ... if you want to go to Old San Juan where the cruise ships dock, it will cost you about $15 for a cab there. It is several miles away. The weird thing is that the airport is only 1 or 2 miles away from the hotel yet because Puerto Rico charges cabfare by the zone, you will still pay $15 to get there.The hotel overall is kept up pretty nicely. If you can talk yourself into the club lounge (Priority Club) they have great hors d'erves and an open bar! The lobby area and casino area of the hotel are fairly classy and it does feel a little upscale. However, I wouldn't be comfortable paying more than $150 - $175 a night for the hotel based on what you get. If you are looking for nightlife and the real old side of San Juan instead of the beach/pool scene ... this is not the place for you. Stay in the heart of the old city if this is what you want as this is more of a beach resort.

<Content>Can not wait to return! We stayed at the Intercontinental for a one day post cruise stay. All that I can say is that the hotel is amazing. The pool area is great with a large adjacent beach area. We were able to drop off our luggage and pick up towels to hang around the pool until our room was ready. We booked a city view room, but upgraded to an oceanview room. It was well worth the upgrade as we were on the 16th floor. The view was AMAZING!The room itself was fine, I would just say that it needs more up to date bedspread's. Other than that everything was great. There is also a Japanese Steakhouse as well as a Ruth Chris' Steakhouse in the hotel.We will be returning with our entire family next year. The value that we paid can not be beat.

<Content>Would stay there again... The staff was very friendly and helpful.The hotel room was decent. No complaints to report.The pool/jacuzzi/beach was awsome. I always had a spot by the pool and never had a problem with grabing 2 lounge chairs. the pool side cabanas were most of the time always taken.The food at the outside bar by the beach was decent. I heard the food at the pool side bar was outrageous so i didn't even order from there. For breakfast, try MI CASITA which is a great resturant right across the street by the grocery store. it can get busy so don't go there expecting quick service. their lunch/dinner is also very good!we rented a car from avis, which is also located in the lobby of the hotel. with only one person at the desk, it was a bit of a wait when there were others in line. i would suggest going to Charlie's car rental which is literally a 5 min walk from the hotel (make a left and walk towards walgreens from the hotel).if you're looking to gamble, the casino is very very small!we did not eat at the resturants in the hotel since we wanted to eat something different than what we would find in the states. some great resturants to go eat at are in old san juan called aguaviva and parrot club. also one called metropol which is about 5-7min walk from the hotel.overall, i had a great time and would stay at the hotel again.

<Content>Great Hotel for the Price and Location It is a great hotel. The pool is awsome, with a swim up bar and on the beach. Is located next to the San Juan Hotel, so we were able to walk next door and go to the clubs located there. Great service. Would totally stay there again.

<Content>Good stay for the price Stayed in July- paid $180/night for a partial beach view. Pros:1. On the beach - a 5minute walk from the Ritz-Carlton2. Very nice pool grounds + jacuzzi, but not at all on the same level as the Ritz 3. A bigger/better weight lifting room than the Ritz4. Ruth's-Criss is excellent - much better than the ones in CA and Fla5. Very clean, hallways and room so/so furnishings6. 5 minutes from airport ($10.00)Cons:1. Breakfast al fresco - the bugs were trying to dig the salmon2. Smaller TV .. not a big deal

<Content>Very thin walls with lots of noise from other rooms I have stayed at this property several times in the past and have never experienced the problems of my recent stay. The hotel is kept up very well and the staff is friendly and helpful for the most part. The pool is the highlight and is often filled since the beach area is only average so most opt for the pool. In regards to the noise, I stayed on the 12th floor and for both nights of my visit I had been awakened by guests on either side of my room by only normal voices. It was almost as if there was no barrier between the rooms. I would normally immeidately knock or call the room next door but since it was pretty obvious they weren't yelling, I let it go for an hour or so before calling them to let them know of the extremely thin walls and asked if they minded keeping their conversations to a minimum since I could hear every word they were saying including their breathing inbetween their words. To my amazement, my kids slept through it yet my wife and I had two sleepless nights. I would definately think twice before booking a room here again.

<Content>I thought it was great! My husband and I stayed her from June 29th-July 3rd. After reading all the mixed reviews, I was a little nervous but still excited b/c I am not that hard to please. Just a few main things I wanted to let you know:1) an ealier post said that the beach was nasty and had seaweed. NOT TRUE..I thoght the BEACH was beautiful, maybe the difference is the time of year, not sure.2) the El San Juan Casino next door IS bigger, but you pay more for drinks. A beer at our hotel was $4, here it was $6.50...I cant imagine what mixed drinks cost!3 )we followed the advise on a post about taking a bus instead of a taxi to OLD SAN JUAN. Glad we did, there was a lot to see. If you take a taxi, they go the highway and you miss alot. And it definetely cheaper- .75/person opposed to $19 taxi.4) Did not like MOMOYAMA. It was EXPENSIVE. Im all about splurging on a trip, but this was ridiculous. My husband and I spent $95 on 2 entrees and 2 beers and it didnt even fill us up. The portions are very small.5) WARNING- the drinks at the pool bar are actually a LOT more than the drinks at the beach bar. I had been ordering frozen drinks at the beach bar for $8. The last day we wanted to try the swim up bar. When we got the bill for 1 frozen drink and 2 margaritas on the rocks, the bill was $35.39!!! The frozen was $11(not $8) , the margs were $9/each. They auto added gratuity too-so watch out! Blew my mind since the pool bar and beach bar are both of course at same hotel 500 feet away from each other!6) 2 COOLEST BARS we found within walking distance- standing at road with back to hotel-to the LEFT: a bar called Lupi's has good mexican food and slightly cheaper beer than anywhere else we found, nice atmosphere. To the RIGHT- a few blocks down is the Oyster Bar... good seafood, We loved the shrimp bucket- 25 shrimp for $13. At home you cant even get 6 shrimp for that price! and if you are there on Monday nights, they have buy 1 get 1 free! You cant beat THAT!7) You'll notice that there's a COCKFIGHT place down the road. If you wait till it almost is over, they will let you in free. We went just to say we'd been there-sad though.8) One last thing. If you are a SMOKER, get ready to be dissappointed. There is NO SMOKING in Puerto Rico. Not in restaurant OR bars, not even the Casinos. And at El SAn Juan Hotel, you cant even smoke outside!! You have to go outside in front, then backinto a room off the side of the drive... weird! Overall we enjoyed our stay... dont believe the horror stories on this site.

<Content>Great Stay, Great Vacation My Boyfriend and I stayed at the resort during fourth of July and it was great. This was our first time to Puerto Rico and will be returning very soon and staying at the InterContinental Resort again. The pool area and beach are just like the pictures. I loved lounging by the pool. The only negative thing I have to say about the resort are the food and drink prices. Everything in the resort is over priced. But the food is not half-bad. The frozen drinks are great. However, there is a place right across the street next to the grocery store and the food there is AMAZING and CHEAP! The Casino in the hotel is a little dull, but we just walked next door to the El San Juan which has a better night-atmosphere. The security in the resort is GREAT - and if you stay here, you will know what I mean the first ten minutes of your stay! Visiting Puerto Rico - The Rainforest is a must see! Hector, our tour guide, was amazing!!! Also, check out Old San Juan, it is so beautiful. I would recommend taking a taxi - it's about a 15-20 minute ride and will cost $19. However, you could always split a taxi. That's what we did because people from the resort were always going to Old San Juan, so why not share a taxi. I didn't like the bus, it only cost 75 cents but it takes an hour to get there, it's VERY crowded and it doesn't drop you off right in the heart of old san juan. I just didn't like the bus ride. Eat at cafe puerto rico and try the shrimp mofongo - one of the best meals I have ever had in my life!!! Enjoy!

<Content>Not So Glamorous We stayed at the Intercontinental in San Juan just this past weekend, and I cannot say that I was impressed. We traveled with a group of 14, all of which booked rooms here. The rooms are of decent size, but the hotel itself lacks the 'glamour' I would expect of an Intercontinental property. On several occassions throughout our stay, we came into contact with the front desk staff, and not only were they unpleasant, they were abrupt and appeared to be bothered to have to answer questions. Very few times did we see service with a smile, and for what we were paying to stay there, I certainly expected at least that much. The hotel also lacks some curbside appeal, but that seemed to be the case for many of the hotels in that Isla Verde hotel zone. If we were to return to Puerto Rico again, I would not stay at this property, nor would I point anyone in the direction of it.

<Content>Great value Just returned from Puerto Rico, stayed 7 nights at the Intercontinental. Excellent pool, comfortable rooms, beautiful beach view, nice lobby and entry way. The best thing about this hotel is the pool. it's well shadded if you get too mych sun, but there is also plenty of sun if that's what you want. Attentive staff, beatiful landscaping, good food.The restaurant at the end of the pool, on the beach, is not managed by the hotel and the food is overpriced and inferior. Stick with ordering from the hotel. You won't be dissapointed.Drinks are extremly weak. If you want something cool and tropical, order it without alcohol and save half price. They barely put any rum in thier drinks. If you want alcohol, stick to beers, at least you know what you're getting. Beers run about $7 each, mixed drinks are $13.Main lobby is small, not too crazy, so nice to hang out without too much of the local chaos.There is a small restaurant in the Plazoleta de Isla Verde called La Casita. It serves great, cheap breakfast for less than $5 including coffe. If you stay at the Hotel for breakfast, be prepared to pay at least $20.Did not eat at the hotel restaurants. Opted for local restaurants instead.Will need to take a taxi for most of your excersions, including Dinner. There are a few nice restaurants at the Ritz and El San Juan Hotel, other than that, you'll need a cab.

<Content>Good stay The hotel was good though by my standards it fell a bit short of great. The room was comfortable enogh and large. We had a great view of the ocean and slept with the curtains open so we could wake up to the view. I guess what fell a bit short of great was the service and some cleanliness issues with the bathroom.Not huge but it could be improved a bit. The one great thing was the beach! It was so wonderful we rarely used the pool. Just stayed in the sand.We did some sightseeing in Old San Juan and enjoyed that. Found the greatest place to eat tapas. It is in The Old Convento Hotel. Fantastic!!!!! A real must!

<Content>nice hotel, way too pricey I am staying at the Intercontinental as I am writing this...the beach and pool area are very nice, I reiterate, very nice!My room is very nice, overlooking the pool...no complaints there...However, this hotel charges 7dollars for a small box of cereal, 10 -12 dollars for drinks that I think are weak, 3 dollar bottles of water and 3 dollar cups of coffee...One of the hotel restaurants, Ciao Mediterrean, got a good write up by Frommers. This write up must be outdated! The restaurant is on the beach, which is nice, but the food is gross bar food and pricey. The 3 of us had nachos, a few drinks, a couple of sandwiches and quesadillas for 140 dollars! The manager has an attitude but our waitress was very nice.This hotel is directly next door to the El San Juan hotel and we had breakfast across the street at a strip mall everyday. The 3 of us had breakfast for 13 including tip. I am not cheap, but I just do not like being taken advantage of, which I felt I was at the hotel.As mentioned, the pool area(which would not let us bring our own drinks and wants us to buy their overpriced drinks) and the private beach are very nice. I just felt like I was getting soaked everytime I turned around!

<Content>Wonderful Stay!!! My Husband and I just returned from a 2 night stay at the Intercontinental Hotel. I have been going to Puerto Rico all of my life and have stayed through various changes of brand at the location of the Intercontinental Hotel. I have always had great service and the decor of the public areas of the hotel and the rooms were always in great shape. The Intercontinental continues to provide great service and I felt that the grounds were kept up very well. The beach is gorgeous and clean and so is the pool area. The location is great as the hotel is surrounded by many other resorts, restaurants and shops that are all in walking distance. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant so I cannot comment on that, but there are several great little local places nearby. There is a great place for breakfast or lunch called Piu Bella. It is probably a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel and the prices are very reasonable. For dinner I would highly recommend the Metropol restaurant. The cuisine is Cuban/Puerto Rican and is definitely a place you do not want to miss.

<Content>Fun time! Me and my new hubby came here for our honeymoon just last week!! We had a great time,,, after reading recent reviews I was very nervous about what to expect.. But the hotel was nice pleasant workers esp concierge,, And I believe it was Fernando at the front desk that gave us a FREE ocean view upgrade for our honeymoon, which saved us $80 a night!! The pool was nice, the food was good at the cafe/bar outside,, try a cuban sandwich, Its pricey so we only are there twice. The drinks are pricey also. To eat outside the hotel there are local fast food places and small eateries just across the street., Try Mi Casita across the street for PR food, my husband is PR and he loved it. Parking- we did the self park a lot cheaper than valet and the parking lot is right across the small road, (be careful ppl arent to worried about practically running over the tourists and the cross walk). Casino is small, next door and the El San Juan is a bit bigger. They seemed to have DJ's at their pool in the evening myay try that hotel next time. The hotel will give you directions to the rainforest, The largest mall in the Carribean, the bacardi factory and Old San Juan (we had a rental car) The direction arent very exact , need more of exits and landmarks to get you some places. the rainforest is nice but go early the trails are apart from each other and you need to drive up the mountian to them. But there is no big park sign like you would think to find it.. its right up a small Pr town street that you may pass right up, but dont worry youre going the right way. Its just a little diff then what you would look for at home. Also things close at 6pm, the rainforest, shops of Old San Juan, the forts in Old San Juan, the bacrardi factory,, (watch that exit also). So go early if you can, I spent my morning sun bathing and swimming. The ocean is beautiful!!! Also try Lupis to the left of the hotel its a mexican rest with some Pr flare to it. They have burgers also , cute bar and restaurant. We ate at Ruth Chris steak house at the hotel, its expensive but the steak was awesome!! Ive never had steak without steak sauce. But its about $30-50 a steak and all sides and salads are extra so be prepared.This hotel is literally a few miles from the hotel it took us 6 mins to get there and back for our flight- car rental was also so simple if you decide to do that. But driving is CRAZY!!!!! It seems theres no organization at ALL and the highways get very backed up so if youre rushing somewhere give yourself time to get there. They dont use turn signals and will cut you off like its nothing so watch ALL LANES while you drive!!Have fun, I wish I could have stayed longer!!!!

<Content>beautiful hotel! A very beautiful hotel.. the rooms were very clean and the staff was so nice and helpful. The resturants in the hotel are delicious yet a little pricey. The beach is very clean, i had the best time taking in the sun and swimming in the ocean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would love to go back! The only bad thing i can say about my whole experience is be specfic when ordering room service, they tend to mix up orders. So all in all its one of the bet!

<Content>Nice hotel, nicer island Stayed here for my first trip to the island and enjoyed it. The beaches were beautiful, the pool was awesome, and the rooms were pretty good too. I have to say, I was so excited for my first trip there that I could have stayed anywhere and would have love it. This hotel was pretty nice though. The concierge was very friendly and helpful (a puerto rican who grew up in canada?) and the hotel offers many fun tours at reasonable prices. I was there in November, so the weather was gloomy for most of the trip, nevertheless, it was very warm and the ocean was like bath water. The pool was very nicely designed and I made good use of the swim-up bar. The casino was alright, kinda small, but my comparisons are to Vegas and the Indian casinos back in SD. The hallway to our room had gotten wet and was being dried with huge air driers. There was a very strange odor out there. The rooms were fine though, they had not gotten wet at all. I think the hotel could use some sprucing up. All in all, I had a great time and enjoyed a very nice, clean, fun and exciting hotel, with very helpful staff. Try the Pina Coladas at the piano bar!

<Content>Needs an update My husband and I vacationed at the Intercontinental the week before Memorial Day Weekend. Let me preface this by saying that the staff at the hotel couldn't be nicer. They were polite, helpful and friendly. The room, (we had a standard) could definitely use an overhaul. The size was generous, but the furnishings were tired looking. The couch was saggy, and the bed had the same tired looking bedspread that weighed a ton. I don't understand why a hotel in the tropics would not opt for lighter, more attractive bedding to enhance the appearance of the room.The bathroom ,again generous in size, had poor lighting. Ths shower was almost dungeon like. There was no magnifying make-up mirror, so ladies, if you need that to primp, you may want to bring your own. Due to the poor lighting, I had to purchase a mirror and apply my make-up at the the desk. The pleasantness came to a streaking halt as the Friday of Memorial Day weekend was upon us. Hello Coney Island! The guests that came at that point were loud, played radios on the beach, and left their garbage strewn all over the place. I felt sorry for the staff . At that point, I was happy to be leaving the following day. That same night, our neighbors were blasting music at midnight and proceeded to deny it to the security staff that I had to call. I would go back, during a quiet week. If you are looking to relax without the NY/NJ crowd, make sure you do not going during a busy time. ( I am a New Yorker by the way)You may definitely want to try some of the local restaurnats as the hotel food is quite expensive. The nightlife at the El San Juan was a lot more lively on Friday and Saturday nights, so we found ourselves walking there in the evenings.

<Content>Wonderful experience at the InterContinental!! What a classy resort! I think their biggest attribute/selling point is their employees, so I will begin on that topic.The staff here is wonderful, from the concierge to housekeeping, they always had a smile on their face and really wanted to make you feel welcome at their resort! I cant say enough about the service here, it was TOP NOTCH!! We barely had to lift a finger here, they did it all for us!! We ended up at this resort because we originally booked at the Marriott and left after a hellish firt night there. Because of our last minute change, we couldnt get into our room for a couple of hours, but they offered us a hospitality room to get situated in and change for the beach. When our room was ready, they brought our luggage up for us and even stored my husband's golf bags for us in their storage area (not at our request) so we wouldnt be inconvenienced with having them in the room with us! Our room was nicely appointed and comfortable. Bathroom was a bit on the smaller side, but it never was an issue for us. Over all we were quite comfortable in our room. The grounds here are beautiful, we LOVED the pool (it was huge)and we were even more enthralled with the beautiful BEACH!! Spots at the pool were definitely a hot commodity; I got up at 7 am one morning to jog on the beach and guests were already saving spots!! They have awesome cabana like set ups at the pool, but only about 5 of them and they were almost always taken, especially over the weekend. The pool has a great swim up bar with flat screen tvs and bartenders that are ready to serve you!! The beach is equally beautiful - the only downfall here is that you have to pay 10 bucks to rent an umbrella. But, its worth it. The sand is so soft and the water is so warm. There is also a beach bar/restaurant that serves great food and drinks...try the salads here, they are WONDERFUL!! Also, try to get Katherine as your server...she is prompt, friendly, and always smiling! We loved her!! We had breakfast in the restaurant thats on the lower level (cant remember the name) but it was delicious. They also have a cheaper, more continental like spread in the main lobby that came in extra handy with tons of fresh fruit and bagels - yum! Overall we especially enjoyed our stay here and would return again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Just okay We had come for a wedding and got a decent rate of 185 a night. Puerto Rico in general if you stay in San Juan I dont think is a very luxurious vacation. The water is not crystal clear blue and the sand is not white like some other islands in the carribean. The drinks were priced outrageously. Lunch for 2 was 50 bucks a day. They were doing construction on the elevators so be prepared to wait. The restaurants are nothing special. There is a japanese restaurant that is very casual and small and as for Ruth Chris, you can eat that any time in the States. The pool area is clean and pretty. The service is pretty good. Its close to the El San Juan which is where I recommend going to at night. Its right next door and is a fun place to hang w/a large casino, shops and good eats. There are tons of airline staff staying here and business people which is who i think they cater to. Overall, it was not a bad stay just nothing special. I would recommend the EL san juan next door which or a different island altogether. And bring bug spray. I got bit up really bad on the beach.

<Content>not a bad place - they try hard We booked this hotel for just one night using pricelines name your own price. We paid $150 and they gave us a ocean view room with two beds. The rooms were nice but nothing to write home about. The bathroom is the same size as any limited service hote (H.I express etc)The pool is nice and the hot tub was very hot. The front desk was very polite. The beach is an OK urban beach. There was a lot of seaweed when we stayed but hey its the ocean so I am not complaining about nature. The hotel is located on the main drag in Isla verde and it is close to the airport. You can hear the planes but they do not blow you out. The hotel food and drinks are priced so far out of line its not funny. $10 for a frozen drink at the pool. Rum is cheap in Purto rico but if they have to blend it with ice and add juice it will cost you $10 (at least at this hotel)You can walk right across the street and buy anything you want at Ok prices. The family (local) restaurant Mi Casista had good dinners for about $10 a plate. The service can be spotty but the food at Mi Casista is yummy. We had a party of 7 and the bill was $97 with tip. The same food at the hotel would had to have been $300. The bottom line for this hotel is the price. I could never see myself spending $300 a night to stay on a so so beach in an OK hotel by the airport for that kind of cash. I can see spending that much for, lets say the Four Seasons Maui, but not here. I also saw airline pilots staying here. The must give a real price break to the airlines (?)If you need to stay in San Juan and you get a good price for this hotel then you will have a good time. Puerto Rico is just such a crowded traffic congested place that I cant see myslef coming back. If you are looking for tropical paradise then go maybe to Culebra or another island. I am sure for $300 a night there are much much better options.

<Content>Superb Beds, Beautiful Place I am fortunate enough to work for a company that allows me to stay at the InterContinental while there for work. While I agree that this hotel is pricey, the rooms are wonderful and everything is spotless. The staff is always courtesy and friendly. Let me tell you...the beds are SUBLIME!! I can't wait to crawl into bed at the end of the day because I know I will get an amazing night of sleep. The bathrooms are clean and the showers have great water pressure. The pool area is beautiful and very relaxing. There are a number of restaurants in the hotel but expect to pay a premium to eat. Breakfast is expensive but the spread is amazing. While I don't get to enjoy the InterContinental as a resort, it is very relaxing and rejuvenating at the end of a long day.

<Content>Treat yourself to something better... I usually stay at the Ritz on business (which is actually a pretty nice place), but got stuck here.1) Location: right next to the airport. I mean right next to it. You can taxi in to old town, or use this as a base camp to see other parts of PR. Doesn't feel very tropical? I am not sure why so many hotels hug the airport....strange location to me.2) Staff: indifferent at best. Only the folks working the bar seemed sociable, friendly. Check-in was mechanical, no one smiled. 3) Facilities: nice pool area and beach bar. Beach is fine, just seems small to me. Basically everything outside is OK, everything inside has a wierd sleeze appeal. The casino (like most all casinos in PR) is depressing. Jockey early for beach chairs.4) Rooms: smelled of mildew. Temperature control was difficult' I layed on top of my comforter to sleep because with the lights on I noticed that the underneath was dirty...hairs, spots. Gross! Please, I beg managment to invest in new bed stuff! Bathroom was OK, 3 star set-up. Shower had plenty of pressure and the water was warm. As far as a tropical tourist destination folks tell me that PR can do the trick, but one needs to get away from San Juan and the airport to enjoy its beauty. This place was just a necessary stop for me, so if you can avoid it...please treat yourself to something a little more enjoyable.

<Content>Had a wonderful time We stood in the Intercontinental from May 3 - May 7. We booked through beachdestination.com and had a great price. Arrived at the hotel at 2pm and was given a room right away. Even though check in was at 4 pm. Room was your average room not that impressive. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. I stood with my husband and 2 year old daughter. I read some reviews about the pool and the lounge chairs. I had no problem getting lounge chairs at all. I feel sorry for guest that dont know the area and dont know where to go for food b/c it can be very expensive. A hot dog and fries for my daughter by the pool was $12. We went to the mini market accross the street and stocked up goodies for my daughter. The mall accroos the street has a restaurant called Mi casita and they had a great breakfast ( service can be a tad slow) we were going there everyday for breakfast 3 orders of eggs, home fries and panakes with juice and cofee $21 with tip. Better than the continental breakfast at the hotel which was 20 pp. We had dinner at truth steak house one nigt at the hotel. I was not impressed. being from New York and having great steak house here, thougth it was over price and not that great. Over all for the right price I will stay at this hotel again. The rooms were clean and service was good

<Content>Not quite a 4 star, but decent enough. Reading the Trip Advisor reviews prior to going helped to set my level of expectation. Most of the reviewers are right on the money. The hotel is not perfect, but for the price, just fine by me. Traveling with my wife and two kids, we had plenty to do and see.Positives: I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Our housekeeper was friendly and kept us supplied with extra towels. Tipped her well my last day. Location is good. $20 bucks via taxi to Old San Juan, great mom and pop restaurant across the street, Mi Casita. Negatives: The cabanas are being reserved at 5:00 in the morning. I'm not kidding. Went down one morning at 6:15 (the Starbucks is at the hotel next door) and all of the cabanas were taken. Be prepared if you want to hang at the pool all day. Speaking of the pool, the water could have been a touch clearer. If you don't have a pool you probably won't notice it. Something that could be readily addressed. Food and drinks around the pool area are offensively priced. 2 drinks, 2 sandwiches, $50 bucks. One other thing, just to be aware of. The hotel casino is open until 4:00 am. That means doors are slamming shut in the hallways around 4:15....everyday. There really not a whole lot that can be done, other than to ask folks to not let it slam shut. Oh well.All in all a pretty decent trip for the buck. Like I said, this is not a 4 star in my opinion.....a high 3 star trying hard to move into the 4 range. I'd go back, if the price was right. So, temper your expectations, read the other reviews, and enjoy yourself, you're on vacation!

<Content>Weekend Getaway at Intercontinental We had a great stay at the Intercontinental. We received an ocean view top floor room upgrade which was amazing. The pool and beach areboth really nice. Service overall was very accomodating and friendly.The free wireless service was also great. The work out facilities (only 2 treadmills) do need improved facilities. Easy cab ride to airport, restaurants and main tourist areas.

<Content>Enjoyed this hotel Just spent five days at the Intercontinental and had an excellent experience. Hotel itself is 3.5-4 stars, staff is excellent, food is over priced but where isn't it on an island. Be clear this is not a Four Seasons or a Ritz; but it provides an enjoyable vacation complete with the amenities which most of us expect. Beach is pretty but seaweed is a problem near the shoreline; venture out a bit and it goes away. Pools are very nice and well kept. Expect the beach to be pristine and beautiful as can be and you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Restaurants are good, location is central to other activites. I'd recommend renting a car for sightseeing. Price is right; enjoy.

<Content>Fantastic Experience  The airlines put me up at the Intercontinental after a missed connection so - obviously - I had not planned to stay at this hotel, nor in San Juan at all. Lucky for me, the 24 hrs I spent at this hotel turned out to be the of my larger Caribbean vacation. The staffwas wonderful, polite and accomodating. The pool was beautiful and well-maintained and there was someone ready to set out a chaise on the beach for me when I wanted to soak in the ocean instead. There isconstruction near the pool but you can avoid being distracted by it by setting up camp near the waterfall (drowns the noise) or on the other side of the pool. Not a big deal. I lunched at the poolside barand the waitress was so warm and welcoming that I never wanted lunch to end. The concierge even gave me match-vouchers to use at the blackjack tables just because I mentioned that I was excited abt the casino. I heard that the casino next door at the El San Juan is nicer, but I had such a good time during my unexpected stay that I never considered leaving the premises for a second, until I had to return to the airport the next night for my re-booked flight. I will definitely go back for a weekend away. It's two seconds from the airport and the perfect spot to get some sun.

<Content>Great service I really thought the service here was great. We were able to check in at 10am in the morning! granted we had a room that faced the airplanes landing... Nothing the hotel can do abotu that. I thought that the pool area was great. Lots of shade if you need it. The beach, for a city beach, was pretty nice.The concierge, bellhops, etc were all very friendly. As well as the business center. loved the free wireless.Negatives: Not for the hotel itself, but the chairhogs were worse than on the cruises we have done! 7am and 50% of the chairs were already taken, if you can believe that. Note that we did go spring break week.The area around the hotel is just ok. Doesnt have the charm of OSJ or even the restaurants of condado. We did find a few places though. The room is pretty decent, no moldy smells or anything, but with hotels these days going for the upgraded bedding, they probably need to do that here as well.I used my priority points to stay here.

<Content>Dirty Dirty Dirty San Juan Intercontinental is Nothing like the pictures on their website!!! Room had crumbs on carpet when we checked in and they were still there when we left...watched the maid clean and she used the vaccuum cleaner to prop open the door and never turned it on for two weeks!!!! Hotel is also under construction which we discovered when we checked in...only 2 restaurants open in the evening despite what website info said. Area around hotel was not safe to walk around at night. American Express has not addressed my complaints and we will never use them again as they offer no complaint line or way to fix the complaint while you are in the hotel. Spoke to management and they shrugged it off. Beach full of seaweed. four armed and kevlar vested policemen patrolled pool area daily as well as hotel security...Hmmmm that says alot about area! Avoid this hotel and area!!!!

<Content>It is what it is My college-age daughters and I were looking for a fast and easy get-away for some well-deserved RR . Our stay was: Thursday to Monday over St. Patrick's Day weekend. San Juan is a relatively quick and direct flight from NJ, no passports required, so off we went. Upon arrival, it seemed to me that San Juan is still caught in the 1960's and has never really progressed into the new millenium., I was there in 1968 and it all looked exactly the same. The hotel was 10 minutes from the airport, so expect lots of air-traffic noise, but you travel to the resort quickly by cab, so no long uncomfortable van rides. Our room was average-to-below average in size and style, but was clean.and did not smell. Although we had run of the house we ended up facing the street on the 7th floor. The landing path for air traffic.was our view. We only stayed in our room to sleep, so it wasn't the end of the world, however I do enjoy hearing the waves at night through open windows when staying at an ocean-side resort. and missed that feature. There is a wing of newer rooms that looked really nice, all facing the pool area. Apparenlty these were fully booked when we were there. If you have a cloice and the budget, book one of them.The weather was perfect everyday. The beach, however, is called the Emerald Isle for a specific reason: the green seaweed. The beach, in my opinion, is unswimmable and also smelly due to the seaweed drying in the sun, so it is not even very walkable. The seaweed extends the full length of the beach, well-beyond the hotel's boundaries. If you want a beautiful beach and like to swim in the ocean, don't go here. The pool was lovely. There is one small area that is deep for swimming, the other areas are about 3' deep. Lots of little waterfalls (great for aqua massage) and a swim-up bar. The bar served well-made and strong, albeit expensive, drinks. If you plan on eating and drinking solely in the hotel figure on spending quite a lot of money ( hot breakfast for 3 averaged $70; lunch, with drinks $100; dinners was always in excess of $100, with the exception of the sushi house, where my one daughter and I had maki rolls, wine and dessert one evening for under $50.). A Walgreen's (open 24/7) down the street ( within easy walking distance) sells spring water, I'd suggest you stock up, unless you want to pay $4 for an 8oz bottle. Lots of fast food type places are within easy walking distance. We did not go to any of them.The staff at the hotel was wonderful. Always ready to assist. We prefer iced coffee in the mornings and the wait-staff made sure we had it just to our liking every morning. The concierge service was exceptionally helpful and kind. If my goal had been a luxurious beachy Caribbean vacation...this would not be the place to go. We wanted quick and easy 4 days in the sun by a pool with good drinks and a pool-side lounge to sit and read on, comfortable enough to encourage naps. For this purpose: the Intercontinental was perfect. It was also spring-break and the hotel was NOT filled with rowdy party kids: a plus. We did go to Ajillo Mojillo for traditional Puerto Rican cuisine and it was really good, but know in advance that one entree can easily serve two people and the sangria is very sweet. They make an excellent Mojito.The El San Juan right next door to the Intercontinental has quite an impressive lobby and bar and an interesting little network of shops...worth a quick trip to explore if you get bored. We had an uneventful trip and arrived home tanned and relaxed, so it was well worth it.. I doubt that I will ever plan a return visit to this urban-based hotel. Wishing you safe and happy travels!

<Content>Great stay, they do a nice job! I was very impressed with the intercontinental. The staff was excellent and very helpful. The rooms were clean and modern, with free wireless, albeit a bit small. The pool was nice with all the towels you would like. The beach was nice although they charged 10$ an umbrella. Breakfast buffet was a RIP OFF - 20$ if you wanted anything warm, 15$ for fruit and bagels. Across the street was a diner, subway, small dingy supermarket and burgerking which were very useful for a quick cheap bite. RUTH CHRIS steakhouse was terrific and right there. 19$ cab ride to old san juan wasn't cheap but DON'T take the bus- they said it would take 40 minutes and it took 1.2 hours! Casino was very nice.... Minibar a rip off as expected. Few people with kids looked like they were having a good time.

<Content>Wonderful place, nice staff, great location, beautiful beach. The lobby was very impressive. Staff was wonderful. Access to the beach was free, there were always plenty of chairs and towels (also free) and it was never overcrowded. The beach bar had some nice appetizers. It was nice to sit there, eat and relax. A jet ski rental place was a 2 minute walk down the beach. Driving was very easy in Puerto Rico, no different than the Continental US and the concierge was excellent with directions and recommendations for restaurants and things to do. The Japanese restaurant was pretty good - hibachi grill style. Reasonable prices - around $30 per person.Parking was extra, about $11 a night, including in and out. Not too easy to find a spot, especially at night when the Casino crowd rolled in. We got a junior suite that was very clean and spacious but surprisingly no bathtub, only a small cramped shower.

<Content>A great time in PR Not sure where the negative people stayed but I know I stayed at the InterContinental San Juan Resort, Spa  Casino. It would be really helpful if people rated a hotel, service and their overall stay with a little more objectivity.We just returned from 8 days and 7 nights at the IC and had a wonderful time. Here's my objective ratings based upon numerous stays at hotels ranging from the Four Seasons to Holiday Inn Express.The InterContinental San Juan Resort, Spa  Casino is not a Four Seasons but then again I did not pay Four Seasons rates. It also not a Holiday inn Express - the IC is much better.The reasons people go to the Caribbean - sun and fun!Weather 4.5 stars - rained one day with a few showers on two other days (no big deal). Other than that the weather was outstanding - not too hot just right.Pool - 5 stars - 99.5% complete with a little grout sealing being performed, however, it was not intrusive at all. We had as many towels as we wanted and the chairs were very comfortable and clean. Drinks and food at the pool and beach were very good. Nice place to seat after dark if you like the sound of the surf as you have an after dinner cocktail.Beach - 4 stars - there was a lot of seaweed in the water for about 25 feet. The beach was clean but there were a few sand fleas. The hotel provided bug spray. The water was warn and clear once you waded past the seaweed. The restaurant was a nice place to sit after dark if you like the sound of the surf as you have an after dinner cocktail.Hotel staff service - 5 stars. Everyone was attentive and very helpful.Hotel property in general 3.5 stars - public areas clean and well maintained. Rating was impacted down a little due to the quality of the rooms (see below).Hotel rooms 3 stars - adequate (how much do you really stay in the room). Need to be spruced up. Bathrooms adequate but really needs to be updated. Not sure how they can be since they are small and there is no room to expand.Food at the hotel (beach) - 4 stars (again this is at the beach not a 4 star restaurant like the Palm's - need to but everything into perspective).Concierge - 5 stars - all recommendations for dinner were excellent!Overall 4.5 stars!Hope this helps.JAT

<Content>ICH San Juan shouldn't be part of the ICH group of hotels! Being a Royal Ambassador member and having stayed at nearly a dozen ICH Hotels around the world (Bali, Tokyo, Seoul, Chicago, NYC, Singapore, Bangkok to name a few) I was appalled by the deteriorated physical conditions and lackluster service of the Intercontinental San Juan. I stayed here with my husband from in October of 2006 as part of our anniversary weekend celebration and we were both astonished to see that a hotel of this quality could considered a member of the ICH Group. The place is in DESPERATE need of a face lift. The quality of the room and bathroom finishings are more like those of a 2-star hotel rather than an Intercontinental Hotel. Furniture is worn and beat up and carpets are old and stained. Bathrooms could definitely be gutted! Furthermore, when we visited the pool was still under renovation (after several months of work!). Mini bars are poorly stocked (beverage and food selection was PATHETIC!). More importantly, I was quite underwhelmed by the level of service. Upon check-in I asked the receptionist twice to confirm that I had been properly upgraded to an Executive room or a suite (standard privileges of Royal Ambassador status). She assured me that I had. To my dismay, she had put us in a standard ocean-front room and not in an Executive room or suite. Given that she spoke Native English, I doubt that there was any miscommunication on my part. When I called the General Manager I was put on hold for nearly 30 minutes until I got the right person. I was then informed that I had not been properly upgraded, but that I could move to a junior suite in 20 minutes. We finally moved, but the suite was showed similar signs of deterioration. We never intend to return to this particular ICH hotel and have advised all our friends visiting San Juan not to do so either. If you plan to be on Isla Verde, stay at the Ritz or at the Wyndham instead.

<Content>Great vacation spot... Intercontinental was great. Staff was very nice and the beach and bar grill is the best on the beach for good cocktails. Not cheap but what is when you are vacationing? Room was clean. Nothing negative to say...even the casino was cleaner than the others.Already wanting to book again soon!

<Content>second visit just as good This was our second stay at the San Juan Intercontinental. Both visits were great. The first time, last April our children were with us. This visit, just my husband and I were vacationing. While the rooms are very average, the ocean view(this stay) was much better than the garden view (accepatible). We were on the tenth floor and you definately had a much broader, pretty view. The pool area, recently re-done (tile work) was just as pretty. THe staff works very hard. They are constantly bending over picking up vacationers junk and throwing it away- shame on the tourists- pick up your own garbage. I have to say, there were families there who were definetly there for their own pleasure. They let their children scream by the pool all day. I actually watched 1 family wake up about 10 vacationers sleeping by the pool around 4 pm one afternoon - unacceptable, not because of the hotel but because of parents with no manners. The staff was very good, the concierge great. The front desk and the doormen wonderful. The strip mall across the street has one of the best breakfast places ever - Mi Casita, wonderful food, very reasonable. This visit we ate at a great little, casual (first night) restaurant named Lupi's. Great fajitas, burritos and margaritas at a very reasonable price. Our weather was absolutely perfect which does make a vacation great. I think the Intercontinental (one of the cleanest beaches on Isle Verde) is a great choice. Only complaint was the price of the food!

<Content>Wish we were back at the San Juan IC right now ! ! We recently came back from our second visit to the SJIC. What a great place. We stayed there from January 6--9th, 2007 to celebrate our anniversary. Our first visit was in January 2001. I can only agree wholeheartedly with the positive reviews this hotel has received. Our experiences both on this trip and in 2001 were first rate. Let me start by saying that I am VERY particular and I pay attention to detail. In fact , I think of myself as an unpaid AAA hotel critic, with lots of experience but no salary. We booked an ocean view room at $350 per night, including breakfast. Not cheap, but all of the top places in San Juan that I checked also seemed very expensive. They also charge the very annoying add-on 鈥渞esort fee鈥?(as do many other hotels.) which can cause some sticker shock when checking out. Nevertheless, we decided to splurge鈥攁nd are very glad we did.The hotel staff learned we were celebrating our anniversary and boy did they roll out the red carpet. I couldn鈥檛 believe their generosity and thoughtfulness. They upgraded us to a huge suite in the club area鈥攋ust beautiful and extremely comfortable. And not only did they give us complimentary fruit and chocolate covered strawberries, they also sent us bottle of champagne that was listed at $100 on the room service menu. Wow--did we feel like VIPs.Just for future reference, I walked around the hotel and checked out the standard rooms. The rooms were clean and in good shape, and the hallways were also in good condition. The rooms are average comfortable size, though the bathrooms are somewhat small, and each room has a small balcony. The balconies are really nice to have instead of the typical sealed up room. You can open your door in the morning and let in the balmy Puerto Rican breezes. Wish I was there right now with a cup of Joe.The breakfast buffet was open air, which we prefer in the tropics, with lots of choices including an omelet /egg station.The hotel has a casual restaurant / bar right smack dab on the beach, with some tables actually in the sand. Fabulous location and worth a visit. The food was OK, but pricy, e.g., chicken burger about $13, but unbeatable atmosphere. There is an Italian restaurant, although it was closed for renovation. We didn鈥檛 try the on-site Ruth Chriss Steak House. We tried the casino, but didn鈥檛 have much luck. The lobby is quite stylish and up-to-date, with lots of activity. The pool area was beautiful, with a cool swim-up bar, poolside restaurant with an outdoor bar-b-q chef on duty, which was a great idea. Apparently the entire pool area had just been renovated. When we were there we had no problems finding a place to sit or swim as some prior reviews mentioned. The multiple pool areas and hot tub are big and beautifully landscaped. One of the best restaurants we ate at on the trip was the Metropole, which is a very popular local鈥檚 institution. It鈥檚 just a five minute walk from the hotel. The place gets quite crowded but worth the wait. They serve terrific (and very inexpensive) Cuban/Puerto Rican food. Turn left out of the hotel, cross the street and the restaurant is just past the cockfighting stadium (we didn鈥檛 stop in there.)The hotel concierge, Jossell, couldn鈥檛 have been more helpful. (In fact, the service at the hotel was terrific from everyone we encountered.) Jossell recommended a kayak outing to the bioluminescent bay (only at night), which was a great experience, even though we had never been kayaking before. I think the best time to go, if your timing is right, is on a moonless night. There really is a so much to see and do in San Juan and Puerto Rico, we hope to stay longer on our next trip.

<Content>Good experience at the Intercontinental The basics: Very clean, large room, but nothing out of the ordinary. Very accomodating staff, booked our snorkeling and bioluminescent bay kayaking trip (highly recommended!) with no problems. Ruth's Chris steakhouse is in the hotel, which was great - when we arrived, they said they had no record of our reservation, which was made by the hotel, but quickly sat us anyways even though they were quite busy. We stayed here in mid-August, which was VERY quiet, definitely the beginning of the off-season. The hotel is located on the beach next to a strip of hotels, including the El San Juan (great casino). Across the street is Wendy's, Pizza Hut and a bakery, which is good for a cheap breakfast but be prepared to wait a long time for your bagel - they are very slow. Also check out the Palm restaurant at the El San Juan. The only drawback is if you are into the outdoorsy kind of activities, stay in Fajardo instead. We went on two trips and both of them involved 1+ hour trips to Fajardo by car. Overall, a good experience, there are so many fun things to do in Puerto Rico to keep busy!

<Content>An excellent choice with a great pool area and beach My partner and I stayed at the Intercontinental this month and at its competitor, the Marriott, a year ago. Both were fine choices, but we liked the Intercontinental better. The great draws are the excellent beach and the beautiful pool area, which is attractively landscaped. Although there was some canned music in the pool area, it wasn't obtrusive and there were areas where one could escape it entirely. The layout was exceptionally attractive for a big hotel. Even on a sunny high season weekend, there were plenty of chairs. The restaurant near the pool is very pleasant. If you're willing to lunch either early or late, you can usually get a table with a delightful beach view. The beach itself is much more appealing than the one near the Marriott, which we rarely used. Our room was quite comfortable. It was definitely worthwhile to pay a bit extra for the ocean view as the view is truly spectacular. The balcony was nice to have, but quite cramped. In this respect, the Marriott was better. Also, the Marriott's furnishings seemed a bit more up to date.  Our only irritating experience at the Intercontinental occurred at 3 a.m. on our first night when a fire alarm forced the evacuation of the entire building. Of course, the false alarm that prompted this wasn't the hotel's fault. But one might have welcomed at least a word or small gesture acknowledging our inconvenience -- perhaps a free cup of strong coffee the next morning to help us wake up. Nothing was forthcoming. But overall, the service was quite efficient. The concierge staff were exceptionally helpful and pleasant. After we asked housekeeping to perform a minor chore, a manager called to make sure that this was done satisfactorily.  On the negative side, the Isla Verde area where the hotel is located is mainly high-rise condos and has less neighborhood atmosphere than Condado, where the Marriott is located. Condado seemed to be better supplied with appealing little restaurants than Isla Verde. But we had a delightful dinner at the Fontana di Roma, incongruously located on the top of the Howard Johnson in Isla Verde.  Overall, we'd definitely take the Intercontinental, but on a snowy New York day, a few days at the Marriott could look fine too.

<Content>Los Banditos Serves me right for planing a trip spur of the moment. My GF and I decided to take a last minute trip to escape the NYC cold. The El San Juan was booked up and I do not think the Ritz is worth the money due to the fact that San Juan has a foul smelling beach. I am not sure where other reviewers get their opinion of the water here but trust me as I have seen some nice beaches THIS is NOT ONE OF THEM. It is filled with seaweed and smells like bad fish.Our experience began with American Airlines canceling our 6 am flight to San Juan and taking the liberty to rebook us on a 9PM flight. Our travel agent was able to get that taken care of. Once we arrived at the airport we discovered that the flight was severely over booked. terrible turbulence and a great deal of screaming children later we finally arrived at the lovely hotel.After tipping the girl at the front desk we waited only about ten minutes for a room. We were rewarded with one of the highest non smoking ocean view rooms in the place. Lucky us it was on the fourth floor overlooking the main roof of the building. I am sure if the palm trees, the bars, the pool side cafe, the vines, and jungle all fell down there would be a nice ocean view but i Could not see it from my vantage point. One quick trip to the front desk and we were changed to a smoking room on the eighth floor. The hallways smelled of cigars but the room was not at all smoky. My thoughts on the rooms are as follows : The bathroom is too small. The ceiling in the shower is so low that you cant really move around. The door swings open into the space and doe not allow for you to move around in the bathroom. All of the outlets were old and did not even hold onto some plugs. The bed was an old fashioned box spring mattress that had definitely taken a few beatings in its life time. To its is pointed in the direction of the balcony ( so small it should be called a ledge) I think its this was because there is no room to position it other wise. The rooms has a lovely alarm clock CD player that will keep you up at night due to the fact it searches for CD tracks even though the cd is off and nothing is in it. There is a fridge so stock up on water at the supermarket because you may tend to think its free being that the Intercontinental left no price list for items in the fridge. Also there are no prices on the spa menu either. I must say that they do offer a continental breakfast. I think they should call it the Intercontinental Breakfast because they charge for everything so whats the point? I understand that looking at the room service that the going rate for a 1 muffin + I yogurt + two eggs + coffee and juice is now $19 + $ Service fee + 19% gratuity.So these few kinks had me a little annoyed but its was nothing we could not deal with. Having been up since early morning we decided to go by the pool. The pool is lovely the water is a bit cool for some but i loved it. The food pool side is however over priced and not of the quality they should serve given the money the charge. $15 dollar nachos were among my favorite along with the $13 cheese burger that had more chunks of crap in it than anything. They do have a nice BBQ at poolside that has a man with a chef hat doing something. Except when you order your food from the grill menu it comes from inside. The frozen drinks were nice but beware they constantly offer a little extra rum etc which they do charge you for. Also the hotel has taken the liberty of adding their own gratuity onto the bill and then putting a line for additional gratuity. That being said just as i fell asleep poolside i was woken by a lovely woman speaking on here phone about the Barry Manilow Concert she had just attended at a volume not fit for vacation. The worst thing ever done was not making a PR a place where you must pay for roaming. The catch phrase poolside was  Call me its free I am sure this is because everyone wants to hear people chatting it up poolside with their friends back home. There were also a huge number of kids. I love the little ones but there were just so many that they took over the pool. There was hot tub but so many people were in it that I feel it was dirty. Also children were constantly in it even though it specifically says no kids. On the other hand there were a lot of over tanned fat people. When i say fat I am not trying to be mean but the obesity that surrounded this pool made it look like a lake in the Serengeti where hippos would wash.Our first night we had dinner at the Palm which was good if not for the drunken rowdy business people. Take note that from my observation the Intercontinental caters only to business people being that they have a special club for them. They also in my eyes write allot of the reviews here. Hey I would like the place too if my boss was paying. But since I am the boss I think its a huge rip off. The following was so funny I could not bear the get mad that it happened. At 1 am the fire system had a false alarm. Which sent me jumping from my bed like a madman. This alarm system they have is more like an air raid signal. I was convinced we were under attack. It subsided after about a minute. I put my head back down on the lumpy pillow and fell right to sleep. Despite the fact the air conditioner is directly over the bed. Which is nice because cold air does drop down and give you the chills who wouldn't want cold air pumping on their body all night. As i reached my third dream the Air raid signal came on again. This time its was followed with a please evacuate the building warning. Which was lovely and I must say that if you think these hotties look good by the pool (yuck) you should see them in their night things. After walking down the eight flights of stairs and through the back of house we arrived at the pool and were instructed to wait there by a man who then left for a half hour. Finally one of the tourists decided it was safe to go back in the building and we all lined up for the elevator. Since only tow of the three were working for the trip we opted for the stairs. So now that they got false alarm number two out of the way we headed back to go to sleep. I felt that we were owed some type of reimbursement for our troubles. The hotel felt differently. But Assuming it was a false alarm the first time the fire system should have been put on test.That being said we were allowed to sleep in for the rest of the trip. Although since the wooden doors only close when you slam them expect to be woken by people going out to reserve spots by the pool. Also spots on the beach that they hold while they are at the pool or at wendys across the street while they buy themselves some nice treats. Overall the pool is crowded with taken chairs which never materialize any real people. I decided that since Sunday was our last day we would got to Condado to shop at Cartier Louis V etc. So we asked the concierge to see if everything was open. She assured us it was and we hopped in a cab and took the 5 minute ride to Condado to discover that everything was closed. So we took and round trip ride that cost $30 and produced nothing.The Casino is like a nightmare. I have seem better gaming in the back of bars here in NYC. The machines are mostly broken. Or maybe they shut them down if they pay out? Not sure but beware the El San Juan is just a minute away and their Casino is nice. Perhaps they will set up a shell game or three card monty in the lobby because thats the level of gaming to expect from this hotel.Overall I cant say anything bad about the people that work there. The bellmen and the staff are really sweet people working for a living. The hotel chain is horrible. They do nothing for their guests. I love the option of paying for turn down service as well every other thing real hotels do as a courtesy for their guests. Being the people who work there recommend other hotels I guess its fair to saw we have been duped by the intercontinental. Next time I will stay in Fajardo or the El San Juan. I feel truly sorry for all those who were not informed the pool was closed but it seems par for the course from this hotel chain.

<Content>this is the best part of san juan the rest of the city I am not too crazy about especially after just been to aruba. we stayed at the club floor which is the lobby level. one benefit is that you avoid waiting for elevator that some people complained about. the balcony faces the garden and pool and very restricted view of the sea, it is bigger than the regular balcony, it can fit in a round table. the garden and pool are beautiful and plenty of lounge chairs. the chairs on the beach are free. the club floor has a nice club room with free continental breakfast and free cocktail hour from 5-7 with all you can drink and snacks. We ventured to OSJ one day, took the bus in front of the hotel all the way to the end, saw part of the city on the way ( taxi would go on freeway). at the pier, there are two free trolley buses you can take. you can get off any time and reboard and see most of OSJ with minimal effort . we had a nice lunch at Il perugino In OSJ.fontana di roma in howard johnson has good food and frienly family style dining. Pikoya in the museum is high end, the food is very good. Atlantica has the best fried calamali but the other items were not so good. we were not impressed with miro and BLT. the pool restaurant at the hotel is excellent for lunch, we ate hot dog and hamburger there three times. Although the hotel is excellent, we don't like SJ that much to warrant a return visit.

<Content>Terrible Service I guess I was expecting the service at this hotel to match the amenities. I was wrong. The property itself was quite nice, well-located and well-maintained. It's on a nice stretch of very pretty beach. But the service certainly left a lot to be desired and made our stay less than enjoyable. Enough so that I would recommend staying elsewhere (perhaps the El San Juan next door?). We stayed in the Club wing - the section for the Intercontinental's Ambassadors members. The woman in charge of this section should not work with customers; she was actually MEAN to guests - many of those in our party compared notes on the ways she insulted or mistreated us. Her behavior colored all the rest of our experiences at the property. As a result, we found that none of the staff were particularly friendly or warm. Perhaps if she had been nicer, we might not have noticed the lack of graciousness in general, since we didn't have any particularly bad experiences - but we NEVER encountered even one staff member who went out of their way for any of us. (With the exception of the women in the hair salon - they were very nice.) Another recommendation: bring an extra beach towel - there's absolutely NO way they're going to give you a second towel to use at the pool.

<Content>Awesome Place, good deal and great employees Upon arrival to Puerto Rico's International Airport we could see IC San Juan from the plane, it simply looked amaizing. Upon arrival the Bellman simply was polite, made us feel welcome. And upon enterring the Main Lobby, that is were our experience really started. Brenda, agent who assisted was just charming, thou we had to wait for the room as we arrived early. The Concierge's definetely are the best I have ever dealt with, they are simply GREAT. Jossell is quite the star performer, never, ever says no, if you want it, he will see it happens, what a positive attitude. They were able to plan in a blink of an eye all of our dinner reservations as they took their time to really get to know you, they even asked me if there was any dietiry and/or special need they needed to know before suggesting any Restaurants, now that is professionalism! He gave us options in price ranges, upscale, moderately priced and even a few hidden gems. He offerred options for tours and even adivised of of those tour attractions that we could perhaps do on our own so with Jossell's honesty we saved money as well. Rooms are comfortable, we had a lovely pool view that we could see the ocean partly, next time I'll splurge and pay the extra for an ocean view. Had a minor mishap with the coffee maker, dialed the Concierge and within 5 minutes a new one was delivered and the Concierge, Nestor called back to verify that everything was ok!! The Hotel if a WiFi property and it works fantastic. Maids are incredible, I asked for early turn down and they were right on the ball. Food is great at the beach area but, a little expensive thou. The only draw back, no pool entertainment at all. For a Caribbean Property that I expected latin music tobe play along the beach and as a Resort I expected caribbean games such as doing the limbo but, that never happenned. Upon check out bell captain was requested and was up in the room within a reasonable waiting period. Check out was done by the Concierge, Jossell who really made it difficult for us to depart as he is so professional and corteous and he offerred to even print our boarding passes! I don't know about the other reviews printed here that speak so poorly about IC San Juan but, INTERCONTINENTAL SAN JUAN ROCKS!Thanks for an incredible vacation!Josh

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Great Service My wife and I just got back from a lovely stay at the Intercontinental in Puerto Rico and we had the most lovely and beautiful stay in years. The service was excellent, the concierges were wonderful and booked three amazing trips into the island. The food at the restaurants was tasty and full of flavor. The pool has just been renovated and it's beautiful. The local restaurant across the street prepares a great Mufongo. The staff at the pool bar was owesome. The room was fine and had a nice view to the bay of the city. Definetaly we'll be back in the summer.

<Content>Loved It! We just returned from a stay at the Intercontinental and we LOVED it! When we got there (before check in) we were upgraded to an oceanfront room on the 14th floor and we were so excited. The room was very clean (no smell). The noise from the airport wasn't an issue. The hotel staff was very friendly. The bell captains out front work their butts off and are very helpful. I thought it was worth every penny and I don't usually splurge on hotel rooms. My only complaint would be the elevators were a little slow and the bartendars didn't go out of their way to engage in conversion ,but nothing that would keep me away, they weren't rude by any means. I would definitely return. It is pricey, but so are alot of the hotels. The pool are is amazing! There are many fast food places within walking distance. Isla Verde beach is very nice. Everyone in the hotel speaks english and that was my experience throughout the island. I'd definitely return!

<Content>Rip-Off My fiance and i went over the summer. When I called to make a reservation I was told that the Garden/Executive Suite were worth the extra money b/c they have private gardens. Since the price was not much more and it included continental bkfast, I agreed. When we were taken to our room, we were overwhelmed by the smell of mold. Unfortunately all of the garden rooms except maybe for one or two do not get much sunlight. The room and the hallway smelled like a moldy basement. When we complained we were moved to an ocean view room, which they tried to charge us more for. They claimed that since we booked so far in advance the rates had gone up. We negotiated to stay at the same price we were paying for the Executive Suite. SO basically we got ripped off. And then to top it off there is a resort fee which I believe was $30 a day, this was not mentioned at anytime prior to our trip.The ocean view room had a nice view, but it was outdated and the patios are so small you cant really sit comfortably on the patio.The pool although looks nice, is overcrowded and to small for the number of people it accomodates. the place is filled with children, and the Jacuzzi was luke warm and also had a foul smell to it (it too is in the shade most of the day. The concierge was no help either. We asked for a reccomendation for a restaurant in Old San Juan. When we arrived we were diappointed to find that we were the only people in the restaurant and the restaurant also smelled like mildew.Needless to say, we were disappointed. I do not reccomend this hotel. If you cant afford to stay at the Ritz (neither could we), try the El san hotel, which is in the same price range as the intercontinental.

<Content>Could have been great Having stayed at this hotel several years ago, I was disappointed at how it has been allowed to deteriorate. Our room smelled of mold, the paint in the bathroom was peeling and the door was cracked and warped. The hot tub by the pool was a dirty green during the first two days of our stay, and it was only after repeated complaints that the water was drained and changed. There was a limit of one beach towel per person until several complaints were made by guests, which resulted in two towels being given. It was also galling to have to pay extra to rent a beach umbrella. One would have expected a four star hotel to provide one as a part of the service.The food was expensive and mediocre and my daughter became ill from eating the quesadillas at the beachfront bar.On the other hand, the oceanview was a dream and the friendliness of the staff was wonderful.However, the cost and the four star rating certainly did not add up to the reality of the hotel.

<Content>We liked the Intercontinental We enjoyed the Intercontinental. Unlike the prior reviewer, we arrived very early (off of a cruise ship) and they got us into a room within an hour (about 12:30). The room was nice and well appointed. We did not have a view - but honestly didn't expect one since I had booked my companies contract rate - which is extremely reasonable. The new pool is lovely. We had fabulous service at the Terraz restaurant (outside by the pool) for both lunch and breakfast - but it is pricey! The breakfast buffet ends up at about $25 with tax and tip. It is good though! We had dinner at Ruth Chris which was very good but expensive - but it is expensive everywhere. On balance, we had a nice, restful visit to San Juan and enjoyed our stay at the Intercontinental.

<Content>Has Potential, But Needs MUCH Improvement This hotel needs some work. A lot of work, actually. It's obvious they are trying to do just that, but in the meantime, the rooms are very, very outdated. The furnishings and amenities are way behind what we've come to expect in a hotel at $400/night. The doors, trim, air conditioning vents, balcony railing and plumbing fixtures are all in really awful, outdated condition. They should have been updated 10 years ago -- they are *well* beyond their prime. If you are accustomed to seeing flat panel TV's, contemporary furniture and duvets on the beds, this is definitely not the hotel for you.On the plus side, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are spacious and nicely arranged (other than the bathroom, which is the smallest hotel bathroom I've seen in years.) The beach access is fantastic and the beach itself is very nice. The view from the oceanview rooms is not going to be beat. There are a few restaurants (ie: other hotel restaurants) within walking distance, which is a nice plus, and the restaurants in the hotel (with the exception of the downstairs breakfast restaurant) are nice.The worst part of this hotel is that they had our email address since the day I made the reservation several months ago and we were never notified about the pool renovations. That is really an unacceptable oversight. (And I am probably being generous in calling this an 'oversight.') I cannot even begin to imagine the disappointment this would have created had my stay there been a family vacation! Until the pool is complete, I would be not recommend this hotel, unless you do not mind staying in an outdated room at a resort with no pool. Even when the pool is complete, I would personally not stay here again unless the entire hotel were fully renovated. We debated between this hotel and the Ritz-Carlton, and there is no question that next time, that will be our choice.

<Content>Wowed at the Intercontinental San Juan We stayed at the IC San Juan November 2-4, 2006 as part of a NY-based Management Society group convention of @200. We selected the IC for the 2006 Annual Convention based on our great experience back in 1998. Our group was absolutely wowed by the conference and banquet services during the convention.Staff throughout, were helpful, professional and friendly. Services were efficient and seamless.The property is undergoing renovations which will position this hotel uniquely, among competing properties. We stayed at Club level rooms. Renovations in this area are right up there with those of European hotels, and certainly with the rest on the mainland and locally with like-accommodations. While they are not promoting their beds and pillows, they are more than heavenly! They have not spared any detail with respect to the convenience, ambiance, beauty and comfort of Club-level rooms. We were impressed by the measures of the Security staff that provided a sense of comfort and safety with their discreet and elegant presence. We look forward to seeing the completion of pool renovations that can already be assessed as being Big League.A Wowed Customer.

<Content>OK for Holiday Way below Intercontinental Quality The hotel is OK at best. It does have a couple of high points but is in need of much work. Here is my breakdown after spending a week at the hotel.Rooms:The rooms are in pretty run down condition. They are old and outdated and not very clean. Probably the worst part of the entire hotel is the rooms. They need a lot of work. All rooms ending in 05 such as 1405 are very small because of the stairwell. Stay away from these rooms. The city view side is not bad it does face the airport a couple of blocks away but the windows are fairly well insulated. You do have a distant view of the bay. Casino:The casino is very run down compared to the neighboring hotels the Ritz, El San Juan and Courtyard. We did not win any money at the IC but did well at all the other casinos. It is very smoky, full of rowdy locals and many of the machines do not work. Beach: The beach is nice for a fairly poputated stretch ot sand. Water and sand are both clean. Warm water in November probably around 80 degrees. There are reefs right off the beach here but not recommended to snorkel due to motor boats and jet skis. The beach is a big plus. Chairs from the IC and umbrellas are free.Pool: Was closed and has been closed for a couple of months they keep backing up the reopening date from early OCt to late to mid of November. The current condition is probably reflective of a December opening. It looks like it is nice but not open. Many checking in were very upset and we witnesses many confrontations with management because they were not disclosing this if you already had reservations. It is in very small print on their website.Surroundings:It is San Juan. Probably not the safest of cities. But we felt safe walking at night in the immediate 10 blocks of the hotel. There were a lot of police patroling the streets. You just have to be smart you do not want to be walking around by your self or with all your money on you. But it appeared Carolina where the hotel is was a better area of Puerto Rico. Hope this helps. We would go back to San Juan however we would look for new accomodations next.

<Content>Grrr-They returned our wedding favors !! Our wedding was September 2006 at this hotel. We (bride and groom) arrived one week earlier to meet with our wedding planner, dj, minister, etc. With the increase in airport security at the time, we had many items shipped to the hotel directly including our wedding favors, cake knife/server, etc. to avoid any problems with the airlines. We almost shipped the gown and suit as well. Whew !! Glad we didn't.All boxes arrived... but the hotel returned them because the bride's name was not in the computer !!! Only the groom was registered. How can the bride and groom not be registered in the hotel? Who was the groom marrying after all? How is it the hotel staff is not aware that there is an event and become familiar with the names of the events? The bride's family was registered. Couldn't they have contacted one of them with the same last name and ask if the packages belonged to them?Once this error was discovered, it was not until the bride and groom threw a temper tantrum that any efforts were made to recover the items. Basically, we were told, I'm sorry, but she was not registered and the packages were returned They did not want to initate any inquiries and try to get the boxes back until we made a big stink about it.Needless to say, we are very disappointed in the hotel and the way the staff just brushed off our issue.Feel free to contact us for a more intense description of our miserable experience at this hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Relaxing Environment but still Overpriced Our three day visit started Oct. 22. The Intercontinental San Juan Spa and Resort is probably one of the nicer hotels along the Isla Verde beach front. However, compared to hotel spa and resorts found on the mainland particularly in Las Vegas it would only rank as average. The pool was being remodeled therefore it was unavailable to guests. This didn't present a problem for me because I enjoyed the beach and ocean which had easy access from the hotel. We reserved a city view room but we told we had been upgraded to a deluxe city view. The difference was simply that the deluxe city view was on a higher floor (5 and above) instead of (2 - 4). Our view was actually very nice. We could see the airplanes as they landed and when there were no planes you actually had a distance (very distance) ocean view. The hotel is only 10 minutes from the airport but the noise of the planes didn't bother us. Others have written that the walls of the hotel rooms are thin, that is correct. The noise didn't really bother me as much as it bothered by roommate. One thing that annoyed us both was the television speaker in the bathroom. It was loud and intrusive. We actually had the maintenance staff cut it off. Instructions should have been left for the guests so we could have cut it off ourselves.The Intercontinental was nice but I think very much overpriced. San Juan for tourists probably has seen better days. I think passing through San Juan before going on a cruise is fine but as a final destination you鈥檙e better off going to St. Thomas or Aruba.

<Content>What is up at IC!!!! Regrettably I was not able to stay at IC. I have been watching for a month and a half , concerned about the work on the pool area. IC kept moving the date out by 2 weeks. Last week called on 23 advised will open 30 or 31. Called 27 now changed to Nov 15.Finally got my TA to call the hotel and they say not even the end of No likely.Now all hotels are pretty well filled up. In my opinion they would have been better to say pool closed indefinitely. At least that would be more honest.

<Content>Great hotel! I found a great deal for this trip to PR through Liberty Travel. My husband and I stayed at the Intercontinental from 10/11 - 10/15. We arrived in San Juan at 11am on Wednesday and the hotel allowed us to check in that early. We were booked for a city view room but were upgraded to a ocean view on the 16th floor. We also had complimentary breakfast each morning which was great. The food will definitely fill you up for the whole day. We were still disappointed about the pool being closed. I called before my arrival to see when it would be open and was told it would be open by 10/15. When I got there they said the end of the month. You can use the pool at the Holiday Inn as an accomodation, however, the one day we planned on using it, the hotel was having an event and we couldn't go. The hotel staff is VERY PLEASANT. They address you by name every time you call and if you need anything, they are there in a minute and even call to make sure everything was taken care of afterwards. Outside the hotel, the people were no where near as friendly, and I wasn't impressed with the rest of San Juan. But if you want to go somewhere to relax on a nice beach, this is the place. Too bad the pool was closed. The pictures looked beautiful.

<Content>Word of caution While I did not have problems while at the hotel, I have been struggling for the past month to have my eyeglasses returned. My first call to the hotel, I was told they had been turned in and would be sent to me straight away. It has been over a month and numerous phone calls, including a call to the manager, and I still do not have my glasses. No one will return my phone calls. This was my first stay at an Intercontinental property, and I am not inclined to ever stay again due to their unresponsiveness.

<Content>Looked nice, too bad the pool was closed My friends and I had booked on-line. A friend recommended the hotel because of the beautiful pool and swim up bar. When we arrived, we were informed that we should have been told when we booked (we weren't) that the pool was closed for renovations and instead we could take a shuttle bus to the Holiday Inn's pool. We were offered our choice of a few amenities - casino credits, free breakfast, a 30 min massage, etc. Since the reason we had booked there was the pool, we decided to go elsewhere and ended up at the beautiful El San Juan.

<Content>Absolutely paradise..perfect in evry way!! What a paradise, stayed there while on business with the military, govt rate of 195. Right on the water with its own beach and casino. The rooms had couch and coffee table, rooms from the 10th floor up have a great view of the ocean. Food and drinks are expensive, 8-10 bucks for a rum and coke. Grocery store across street. Eat at Lupi's a few blocks down, mexican sports bar-great fajitas.

<Content>Just returned from long weekend Just returned from a long girl's weekend at the Intercontinental. We had orginally booked the El San Juan but after reading all the terrible reviews, we changed. We were checked into our rooms with no problems even though it was only noon (the people who work here are extremely nice). The room was fine (we were on the city side). Nicely sized, clean and the beds were pretty comfortable. The bathroom is very small but there's a seperate area with a mirror and outlets that's very useful. Like some other reviews mentioned, the walls are very thin, you can hear everything in the hallways, but it was never an issue while we were there. The pool area is very nice, a little wear and tear here and there but they keep the area very clean. We never had any problems getting chairs together and there is a lot of shade for those who don't want to be in the sun all day. From what I understand, they're starting a pool rennovation on September 5th. We didn't spend much time on the beach but the area in front of the hotel had the softest sand I've ever felt and the waves were nice and calm. By the pool there is the pool bar (the rum punch is really good) and a restaurant between the pool and beach that's good for lunch. A word to the wise- the drinks are kind of pricey. It cost $46 a pop for the four of us to get drinks so it starts to add up. But if you're inclined, you can walk across the street to the market and buy a whole bottle of rum for $12. We ate at the sushi restaurant the first night and it was so-so. The other nights we went to the Parrot Club in OSJ (always a favorite) and then to the Palm at the El San Juan next door, also very good. Overall, if you want to be near Old San Juan and the El San Juan for the casino, clubs, etc but don't want to pay Ritz prices, this hotel is a good choice.

<Content>Would Return to the InterContinental San Juan Resort In A Minute! I stayed at the InterContinental in San Juan Puerto Rico from August 21 - 26, 2006. The reviews I read on Trip Advisor prior to going are very accurate. I cannot say enough about this Hotel and about Puerto Rico. This was my first trip to Puerto Rico, accompanied by my kids, 19  17 and my mom. The most extraordinary thing about this hotel, as others have raved, is the service. I have stayed in many five star hotels and the service at this hotel exceeded all of them. The reason this hotel probably gets the four star rating is because the rooms could definitely use a little updating. Instead of two full size mattresses, they should splurge and get queens. This is one of my two complaints from this trip (I will share the second complaint later)! Our check-in was very quick and being the hotel is five minutes from the airport, our flight landed at 1 pm and we were in our room by 1:45pm. We had a problem with our in-room safe and within 2 minutes someone came to fix it. We also did not have enough towels and within 2 minutes of calling the front desk, the towels were delivered clean  hot right out of the dryer. The front desk even called one minute after receiving the towels to make sure that they arrived. Every single employee in this hotel was friendly and helpful. A room with a view of the ocean is a must!!! The extra money spent for this was worth it. We were overlooking the ocean and the pool - definitely heaven on earth!We ate at Momoyama/Japanese, which was okay. However, Pasaggio/Italian should not be missed. We ate the breakfast buffet at La Terrazza, which was pricey and just okay. The restaurant by the beach - Meditteranian was one of our favorites for lunch with a view to die for and excellent salads. The pool area was beautiful and clean. My second complaint about this hotel was definitely the prices of the drinks. It cost $8.00 for a beer by the pool, which was the same as a mixed drink. I think this was the most I ever paid for a beer. It is recommended to go across the street to the supermarket and purchase snacks and your beer there, where you will pay $8.00 for a six pack. Some of the local places to make note of was Platos for local food, which was excellent (a few blocks from the El San Juan hotel) and Piu Bello for coffee and ice cream (also a few blocks from the El San Juan - make a left out of the InterContinental). The bakery across the street that others have raved about in the reviews has great food, but unfortunately we had terrible service - it is probably best to order your food at the counter. We went to Mi Casita Restaurant - next to the bakery for breakfast one morning and the service and food were horrible - everything was ice cold. Being New Yorkers - I guess we are not used to the slow, very laid back service. STAY AWAY FROM THE PONDEROSA STEAKHOUSE FOR BREAKFAST - we found out the hard way. On our trip we visited the El Yunque Rainforest , which was great. We spent an afternoon in Old San Juan, which was fantastic - great shopping, however, the stores close too early - around 6 pm. We ate in a great restaurant in Old San Juan - Barrachina, which claims to be the home of the original Pina Colada - and they were the greatest! This trip was really enjoyable and I would go back to Puerto Rico and stay in the InterContinental again - I could not have asked for better!

<Content>nice place lousy location I checked in on August 24th and waited about 20 minutes in line to be checked in. room was on 5th floor overlooking street. casino is lousy i reccomend going to the el san juan or ritz. food is great but overpriced. gym has great steam room and suana. good beach access. not a pedestrian freindly neighborhood. i would reccomend renting a car to be able to see the rest of the island. overall i think the place has had better times. maybe back in th sixties when it was built. next time i'm going back to the marriott or hilton.

<Content>A bit worn, but all of the amenities From the pictures and description on the web site I was expecting more luxurious accomidations. The walls were very thin, the furniture a bit worn. The bathroom was small. It had a nice balcony for city view. I was on 5th floor and didn't hear much traffic with door closed. Service was very nice, and really enjoyed the tours booked with the hotel. The bed was quite comfortable, mini-bar was a bit sparce for selections. Free Wireless access was nice. The room service food and the Yokahama restaurant were both excellent.

<Content>Intercontinental was Outstanding! Our family just returned from PR last night. It was our first trip there and we had a fantastic time. We are already talking about returning!The Intercontinental was wonderful. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. The pool- fantastic! There were more than enough chairs and umbrellas- it never seemed crowded the whole time we were there. Although the hotel is on a public beach, it felt more like a private beach. No complaints!As far as the room is concerned- it was clean and comfortable. There is a lock box in the room, but even if we left anything out-we didn't have to worry about it. I booked a city view room and my entire family loved it! We usually have ocean view rooms but I thought it would be nice to have something to look at at night. We were not disappointed- we loved the view. You could see mountains in the background, as well as the city. My 11 year old loved watching the airplanes coming in too!For food, there were plenty of choices- but it could get pricey so be prepared! There is a very good Italian restaurant in the hotel, but the service was a little slow the night we were there. We also tried the steak house at the hotel- very pricey but delicious. (Hint: if you have kids that are pickey eaters, do not bring them here!)We had most of our meals out at the pool bar or at the beach side restaurant. We enjoyed both of them!Talk to the concierge about arranging a snorkeling trip out of Farjardo- it was to die for! Rosie (the concierge) first suggested snorkeling to us. We had never been snorkeling before and were a little hesitant, but this experience absolutely made our trip!! You will love it. We were provided very comfortable transportation to and from the marina (which is about 45 minutes away). Lunch and drinks were included on the boat- I believe it was through East Wind Tours. Our tour guide on the boat, Arturo, was very entertaining.We also went to the rainforest and I wouldn't take that trip again. It was beautiful, but very uncomfortable traveling in a 15 passenger van. I believe it was through CB Coach. We were packed like sardines into the van, and at times the tour guide shut off the air conditioning when we were going up! It was an uncomfortable ride to say the least! Our tour guide, Debbie, was very informative but she seemed more interested in giving us her shpiel than in answering any of our questions that might throw her off track from her speech!If you plan on going to the Intercontinental, join the Priority Club. I believe we paid $150 to join, but received a free night stay along with other ammenities after joining. We also were upgraded to the top floor at no extra cost. We definitely plan on returning- it was that good!

<Content>we didn't want to leave We would recomend this resort to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable time. While it is true that the food and drinks in the resort are more expensive than most, the service and attention to detail from the staff could not be beat. Great accomodations...clean and well maintained with much ambiance. Beautiful pool and direct access to the beach with water sports. Complimentary beach chairs and towels are provided by staff. We were provided with a complimentary upgrade before we even asked!! We were also offered a late check out with use of full facilites and a hospitality room to change prior to our late departure flight in the early evening. We recommend the beachside and swim up bars.....gotta try the Voodoo Juice....it wil be a bucket of fun. For breakfast, we would recommend eating at Mi Casita across the street. It is great food at reasonable prices. Lupi's Sports Bar and Grill...just down the street is another good place for a relaxing, casual dinner. There is also a supermarket within easy walking distance to buy your bottled water, sodas and snacks, because it was extremely expensive in the resort...i.e $3.00 for a small bottle of water. Expect to give a $300 deposit on a credit card upon registration for incidental room charges....which works out great for the bars as you don't need to carry cash. Overall, we had a wonderful time and cannot wait to go back!!

<Content>Great Stay! We just returned from staying at the Intercontinental. This was our first trip to PR and this is one of the best trips ever! The hotel was beautiful and the staff, no matter where, were very accommodating! We met so many nice people from all over the U.S. We were complimentary upgraded to an oceanfront room on the 15th floor so the view was breathtaking! The bed faces the window so waking up to the view each morning was more than I could ask for! Yes, the Intercontinental is a little expensive -for drinks mainly but we went to the store and bought our own and kept it in the room. Dinners were great - we ate at the Momoyama and the cost was no more than what we pay back home to go to dinner. We went across the street to the little strip mall to have breakfast which was very good also. One day we ate breakfast at the Ponderosa which was surprisingly good too!We took the Old San Juan tour and the Bacardi tour and they were both fun - not enough time in Old San Juan but we went back the next night and it was just wonderful!! Outside vendors, music and dancing in the streets, outdoor cafes, etc. We did not take the bus to town since we didn't want to be on it for over an hour for a 15 min. ride by taxi - there were four of us so we split the cost - it was much more convenient. This is a fabulous place - I can't wait to return!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Intercontential Hotel good  My expectations were not what I was expecting. I was upgraded because of my club membership. Unfortunately, My room was located on the city side. I felt like I was not away from home since I come from the city. At night I could hear the planes go by for landing. The A.C. was making noise too. The next day, I asked to change my room to the beach side. Of course they wanted more money. I refuse to pay. I told them I cannot sleep at night and I was not spending another night there. I finaly asked to speak to the Mgr. I was given another room with a pool view. I was downgraded to one room but the room was sunny and had a nice view and I felt like I was on vacation. I inspected the room first before I decided to accept. The pool was big and nice.The ocean is the Atlantic ocean, so it isn't beautiful and clear like the Carribean. The beach is big compare to other beaches in P.R. The hotel is old but clean. The staff are alright. The resturants are good but expensive. If you venture out get ready for the hassles of waiting .

<Content>great hotel Great place to stay.The noise that some people talked about ,I never heard it. Sure some doors closed loud but was not an issue.The hotel staff was very helpful.The avis center in the hotel was very helpful.If you are goingto be there 4 plus days I would suggest renting a car for at least one day.Now they drive crazy but its not where you cant handle it.The casino is just that a casino.You can win or you can loose your money.The jet ski rental was cool.The food has expensive at the hotel,but across the srteet and down the street you can find great food for less. Over all I would stay at th IC again .

<Content>Great Location and a great beach Stayed: June 29-July 5 2006. The goods are:  The hotel is located right next to the San Juan Hotel and you can just walk over and enjoy the Club Brava(mix) and lounge (Spanish Band) that they have. Has one of the best pools of all of the Hotels in Isla Verde.Great rooms extremely nice beach (they have servers on the beach). Jet Skis, Banana Boat, etc. Avail.Bads:Expensive drinks and food (avg. drink $10) **You must try their frozen drinks MargartitaPool closes at 10pm, Pool Bar at 6pm (However, there is another pool bar open)Thin walls (Try to get the room at the end of the hallway)Recommendations:Try not asking the locals for directions; they are not good with directions (you will see)stick to the police officers/taxis/visitor center. Do not take the Bus to Old San Juan. You will hear that it is better. However, is time sonsuming and can get crowed. It took us 45 min. to catch it and a whole hour and 10 min to get there. The same thing happen coming back. Do not be afraid to rent a car and wonder out with a map. There is a supermarket down the street that stays open 24 hrs (not the one directly across from the hotel) and buy water bottles some snacks and a bottle of your favorite liquor. This will save you a lot of $$MUST GO TO PINONES. Is a long strip about a 10 min drive E from Hotel. They have a lot of fish and food and music. Some suvernier shops too. (cheap)**try Pinonos,bacalaito, alcapurriasThere is a Walgreen within walking distance where you can get Cash Back (avoid ATM fees) By the way, they are call ATH (A Toda Hora) not ATM

<Content>So So Resort My husband and I just got back from a 5 day 4 night stay at the Intercontinental San Juan. I must say, that the concierge Jossell Velasquez was so warm and welcoming as well as efficient at his job. He made all of our dinner reservations and suggested many things to do. As a matter of fact they upgraded our room to ocean view free of charge. The entire staff was professional and exceeded our expectations, but thats about it. Aside from the staff we would have to say that our room even with the ocean view was small and just like many others have posted before the walls are paper thin. We could hear everything from the hallway. The japanese restaurant Momoyama and Ruth's Chris were both outstanding. Overall we had a great time because we ventured out to Old San Juan and to the Ritz Carlton which is superior in everyway. If you are going to be in the San Juan area a dinner at Prime 787 at the Ritz is a must. Very expensive but worth every penny. Hope this was helpful didn't mean to drag on. Oh pool at the Intercontinenatal was ok, we much preferred the beach where the sand was soft and so was the water.

<Content>Here right now! We're in PR as we speak and I just had to post! Don't believe the negative reviews! It's great at the IC. Hotel provides more than adequate accommadations in a GREAT location. We are active. . .Walked the entire beach daily, went into the RITZ (beautiful but snobby), El San Juan (live salsa at night, great for people watching-- have to see lobby, right next door), The Water Club (roof top bar, sushi, great!) and more. Driving is aggressive but not bad. Got a car yesterday and did the rainforest, Laquillo and Old San Juan. WHEW! Great new Italian restaurant (Sofia, owned by Parrot Club guy, Marco at bar A+!!) Had so much fun, we'r keeping the car today too! Online getting more info form foruns to decide where to go next! Friendly people here. A retired woman just struck up conversation with us yesterday in Old San Juan. She told us about the history of the buildings, La Princesa (the old prison) and the military buildings! It was great. Mind the pigeons~ You have to explore this great island! Book the IC! You won't be disappointed!

<Content>Perfect Vacation My boyfriend and I stayed at the Intercontinental from June 26th to 30th. We had a GREAT time. Everyone says the Intercontinental is pricey, but we got a really good package deal with a garden/pool view, and none of these hidden fees people keep talking about . We ended up on the 6th floor and you could still see the ocean.Definitely get an oceanview room if you stay, like everyone says. We had a hospitality room when we arrived on the city side. No comparison. Also when we left we received a hospitality room on the 16th floor ocean view...WOW! I see why its the higher the better. You could see the whole beach and beyond from this room. It was just gorgeous. I saw nothing wrong with the lobby, I thought the hotel was very nice and clean, and the grounds were beautiful. The pool was really nice (and clean) too, although we are beach people and never went in! Food is what everyone says, expensive at the hotel (but good!), and so many ways to work around this. We went to Mi Casita for many inexpensive meals and thought it was great. Metropol (for cuban) is also just a short walk away. The location of this hotel was excellent. On one of the days we rented a car and drove ourselves to Old San Juan, defintely worth the short trip to this beautiful city. Then we drove to Fajardo and did the kayak bio bay tour. Also DEFINTITELY worth it, a once in a lifetime experience.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and a trip to Puerto RIco. The staff of the hotel and the people of Puerto Rico in general were all very nice and helpful. The only complaint we have is that the hotel's beach had quite a bit of debris on it. Straws from drinks and people just not picking up after themselves (so we would!). The beachside drink service was nice if you want to splurge for it, and so is the beach chair service, but perhaps they should have someone cleaning up the beach periodically as well.Any other questions feel free to email me,thanks,Tracy

<Content>Great Location, Great Beach/Pool It's expensive, but the Intercontinental is a great place to stay in San Juan. 5 Min to the airport, awesome rooms, with great views, fantastic pool area, and the beach is spectacular. It's a great jump off point before a cruise, or with family and kids, to see the rest of San Juan, etc....Quality beds, service, etc. My only complaint might be the late 4:00 PM check-in and except for the speed of the blackjack dealers, the speed of the staff/service is 'slow. or in tune with PR (lol). Dining is typical Amercan, and expensive. Highly reccomended.Jeff n TaraToronto

<Content>Great stay We recently stayed at the InterContinental for 5 days. Our experience was great, and as a result we enjoyed San Juan more than we expected. People comment about the lobby- who cares? The beach was great as was the pool. The staff will issue you a wristband and deliver your chair to the beach. You feel secure at the hotel and pool, and there is an in room safe for your valuables. I would not recommend eating at the hotel- why go to Ruth Chris when you are in Puerto Rico? Buy your breakfast and lunch stuff at the store right across the street and use the in-room fridge. I would consider buying your alcohol there too- the drinks at the hotel are pricey and not that good. Save your money and go to the excellent restaurants in the evening (Pikayo, Lemongrass, or some good ones on OSJ like Parrot Club).The room was not fancy but very comfortable. Clean, quiet at night and unlike many hotels in San Juan half the rooms face the ocean. Get one with an ocean view. Service was excellent, fast check in and great follow up with any requests. There were plenty of taxis and a very helpful valet staff. Far superior to the other similar prices hotels in San Juan.

<Content>Perfect location! Great Hotel! My husband and I stayed here Jun 22- 25 and had a great time. The hotel was extremely clean and the staff very polite. The pool area was very nice and there were lots of chairs in either sunny spots or shade spots. The Isle Verde Beach was great for walking and people watching and always had lots going on i.e. jet skis, banana boats, etc. We ate dinner at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and were blown away by the quality of the food and the service- both spectacular (worth the price). We also walked over one night to the Hotel El San Juan to see what everyone was talking about and were stunned. The hotel lobby is one of the most beautiful i had ever seen- take the advice stay at the Intercontinental but go have a drink at the Hotel El San Juan. The only complaint i have is the resort prices. A beer at the pool at the IC was, with tip, $9.00 USD WOW- we live in St. John in the USVI and that is the biggest resort price rip off we have ever seen. A small martini at the Hotel ESJ was $12.00 USD- YIKES! Luckily there is a store across the street and at the IC they will allow you to bring drinks, snacks, whatever and use the minifridge in the room. Also -after having lunch by the pool one day and paying $83.00 USD for chicken wings, a hamburger, a small pepperoni pizza, 2 beers, and 2 pina coladas we decided to walk across the street where you will also find an assortment of fast food and local restaurants for much much cheaper and that will also taste good!!! I give the hotel and the location and A. We will for sure be coming back!

<Content>Adequate hotel on the beach My husband and I went to Puerto Rico for 5 days. We stayed at 3 different hotels during our stay, and the IC was the last hotel for one night. The location is good because it is right on Isla Verde Beach as it is hard to park a car in this part of town just to use the beach. The water here is very clean and blue-green, not clear as it is on other islands in the Caribbean. It is very calm unlike the wild waves in Pinones, where most of the locals go to swim or in Rio Grande. The only good thing about the hotel is the beach. Otherwise, it is just ok. The lobby is small and not as grand as you would expect it to be. It feels cramped with its low ceilings. The hotel, El San Juan, next door has a lobby and shopping gallery, which makes it feel 5 times bigger than the IC. On Friday evening the IC was very dead compared to El San Juan as it has no disco and just a tame jazz band playing near the bar. The room itself looks very outdated and has very unappealing decor. Not tropical or even modern at all. Could have been any room at a 4 star hotel in Ohio. We did eat at one of the restaurants, Chris Ruth Steakhouse, which always has excellent service and steaks. This is the 2nd trip we have made to Puerto Rico and the 2nd time we ate there, and it has always been exemplary and each time we see Latino celebrities. This being our second trip, we decided instead of spending 5 days straight at Isla Verde like we did the first time that we would hotel hop. It is a great idea to rent a car and drive from place to place instead of being stuck at Isla Verde and taxiing into San Juan. There is not much to do or see if you walk around Isla Verde. There are no chic shops or boutiques as you would expect. We also stayed 2 days at the Westin Rio Mar resort near El Yunque Rain Forest, which was an excellent resort that has what you expect for a 4 to 5 star hotel, not like the IC.

<Content>Great hotel with great service My husband and I went to the Intercontinental for our 10 year anniversary. We loved the hotel! We were on the 14th floor with an ocean view room. Room was spacious and extremely clean. The first night they brought us champagne, fruit, and chocolate covered strawberries (free of charge), since it was our anniversary. Pool area is beautiful, surrounded by palm trees and waterfalls, with a swim up bar (the rum runners are excellent). They had a large, outdoor jacuzzi tub. Bottled water is complimentary, and they do not limit the amount you can have. Food is a little pricey, but that is par for the course for an upscale hotel. We had lunch outside and thought the food was very good. The breakfast buffet is excellent, worth the $19.95-great selection of foods. The service is unbelievable-we did not open the lobby door once-there was always someone there to open the door and greet us!!!!! The concierge, Nestor, was so helpful. I recommend taking an excursion to Las Calebras and Flamenco Beach (supposedly one of the most beautiful beaches in the world). We did not have dinners at the hotel, we preferred to sample the local cuisine. We ate at Parrot Club in Old San Juan, Ajili Mojili in the Condado area, and Barrachina's (down the street from the hotel). All three restaurants were very good. Cab fares got a little pricey ($20 one way to Old San Juan and $14 one way to the Condado area). Although we did not hear rave reviews about the El San Juan, we were told to go inside and see the lobby. I have to say, the hotel lobby was beautiful! Our trip to the Intercontinental was a memorable one!!!

<Content>Bad spa  7 days spent with my huge family of 30+guests and three of us had things stolen from our rooms (jewelry). It was very upseting to all of us. Also, the nail and hair salon was very small and had bad service and cheap nail polish and wax. Their techniques were very bad as well.

<Content>Don't go there! My husband and I, along with our 14 month old son went to Puerto Rico and stayed at the Intercontinental over the Memorial Day weekend. It was not the best trip we鈥檝e taken though we鈥檝e traveled to the Olympics this winter in Italy and with a far younger baby to Mexico and other parts of the US. So here are a few reasons why we would probably not recommend traveling to Puerto Rico.The Intercontinental Hotel itself is very nice. It has a beautiful lobby with marble floors, and dark wood accents. But the walls are EXTREMELY thin. The hotel was hosting various proms, Jr. proms and weddings during our stay and had many teenage guests. They鈥檇 get into their rooms at 3:00 or 4:00 am and have the parties continue in their rooms and all the while it seemed like someone had just stepped into our very own room. I could clearly hear their conversations, the steps they took across their room, and even what they were watching on TV. These events woke us up 3 out of the 5 nights we stayed. Also, the hotel is located in a tourist area with various other hotels, however once you walk across the street you feel like you are stepping into an impoverished urban area with drunk men and scantily clad women on the street.The food throughout Puerto Rico was very hit and miss. Yes, the hotel has three restaurants (none that we visited) but the day we did venture to get something to eat in their poolside restaurant we had an $85 tab for a very plain green salad and a sandwich. Far too expensive for what we actually received. I was much more satisfied when I walked across the street to get some far tastier Puerto Rican food for about $8 a dish. I recommend the Asopao de Pollo (Chicken Gumbo). My baby and husband really enjoyed that. All in all I think we received the best food and service on our second night there when we went to the shopping center across the street for some (of all things) Chinese food.We went sightseeing as part of the hotel鈥檚 tours to the Bacardi Rum Distillery (you get two free drinks and a very well put together tour of the distillery and Bacardi鈥檚 history), Camuy caves (interesting), the Arecibo Observatory, and to old San Juan. We also visited the Fort of San Cristobal and the El Moro Fort, on an alternate day when we decided to go back to Old San Juan on our own. Taxi fair to 鈥淰iejo San Juan鈥?was about $20 each way. One of our tour guides advised us to request a receipt from the taxis as a method of keeping them honest.We had several incidents that really tested our patience while on this trip. On one occasion I asked the hotel鈥檚 concierge to direct me to a restaurant where I could see the sunset but she thought I wanted to have dinner on the actual beach. After going back and forth with her about what I wanted she directed me to a restaurant down the street from the hotel that was nowhere near the beach and was completely empty when we showed up. We ended up walking to a restaurant that sat on the pier which had the worst food and service we鈥檝e ever received. It also seemed like I was at Spring Break central with loud reggaeton music and all the young people getting ready to start their partying. Not a place for families with young children.

<Content>Puerto Rico Before my trip I read several on-line reviews and like always, I was sceptical. We arrived in at the Intercontinental Saturday May 13th approx 2:30 P.M. , after a nice smooth filght. Check in was quick and staff very courtious. We left our luggage with them and went on our way, straight to the beach side grill. The food was good, but very expensive, $12.00 for a hot dog/fries and a hamburger was the same--just add $2.00 for a slice of cheese. The view is beautiful tropical folliage, white powdery sand, and aqua ocean on one side and a lush tropical landscaped grounds with pool/pool bar. Of course you always have to have that pina colada floating or sitting at the pool bar-I just love that whole idea! But again very expensive, $20.00 for two. Only and hour has pasted and we're going up to the room. The room is pretty large, well cleaned and maintained with a king size bed, stocked mini bar, dresser, and tv. Inbetween the main room and the bath room is a nice vanity area to put on make up. Then the bathroom, very clean, nice marble tile , full tub/shower (excelllent water pressure), a hair dryer, iron/board, and even a scale (not that I got on it) I'm on vacation. Our room over looked the front of the resort, that was kinda cool to watch the planes come in and see what was around the area. The bed was comfortable, we didn't mind the sounds out the planes taking off and the sound was muffeled with the sliding doors closed. We're used to noise at night living close to railroad tracks here at home. I only mention this because several reviews stated the the noise was unbarable at times--we didn't find that to be the case. For our 1st breakfast we just went down stairs --again, the food was good, but pricy ($44.00 for 2). Now that we know how expensive it is we went off the property for our meals. You are surrounded by all kinds or fast food (churches chicken, pizza hut, wendy's, taco bell, taco maker), etc. we found the Pondarosa to have a good breakfast--there is even an OutBack restaurant around the corner (definately somethng for everyone). We didn't take any tours, but rented a car (off property cheaper) and explored on our own. Map of island is easy to navigate, exits maked, highways are kinda rough. We went to the rain forest and spent the day (breath-taking) hard hiking if your not fit. Drove around to several beaches, I loved them all and none were over crowded. Took a ride to the caves--that was too cool, it's amazing to be so deep into the ground and stand inside this huge, cool, dark dome with enough light to see what's around, giant stalagtites and stalagmites protruding from the ground and ceiling of the cave. We saw some bats flying around one section and one right infront of me hanging upside down with one wing open . That is the coolest picture I took. We also went to the center of the island and visited with some of my husbands family--the ride was beautiful with water falls that you see after taking a hair pin turn traveling up the mountain. We're not much for night life so all we really did is go out for dinner and stop on the way back to the casino. I liked the one in the El San Juan better than the others and that was only because of the appearance--the others weren't very elabrate for being a casino, well not what I'm used to anyway. We left every night with a little more than what we spent, but then again we're not big gamlers. I would definately stay at the Intercontinental again---When you look at it from the front you would never know that there was a tropical paradise waiting for you on the other side! The island people were very friendly and the weather was fantastic.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Questionable Guests My husband and I stayed at the San Juan Intercontinental over Memorial Day weekend. I was worried about a difficult check-in, tiny rooms, thin walls, etc. I was pleased that everything in those areas turned out ok. Though our room was not ready upon arrival, it was not a problem because we were given a hospitality room to change. I was not feeling well from the flight, so they allowed us extra time in the room. The room was adequate in size... and was very very clean. We were on the 16th (top) floor, and the view was lovely. I didn't hear our neighbors, but did hear doors in the hall closing- not a big deal at all. In general, the accomodations were nice. Not spectacular, but certainly nice enough.The pool was lovely... but overcrowded with loud guests. We stayed on the beach most of the time, and heard boom boxes playing loudly. I think many of the island people vacation there for a night or two over the Memorial Day weekend. I felt as if it were more a spring break atmosphere... not what you'd expect for $300+ a night, and in May. Tuesday after Memorial Day was the best day. The beach was also nice. Definitely a people watching beach! Ocean water was nice as well. Not crystal clear, but still clean and warm.The conceirge was great- though they recommend you take the bus to Old San Juan for 75 cents as opposed to a taxi- $19 one way. DO NOT take the bus if you want to feel secure and comfortable. Very shady characters. My husband and I could not understand why the concierge would recommend doing so.All in all a nice place- not a great weekend in terms of the occupants there, but we enjoyed ourselves at the Intercontinental anyway.

<Content>A Perfect Vacation The hotel's staff is so incredible. They treat you like royalty. My husband and I celebrated our 10 year ann and stayed there in May 2006. We were upgraded to an ocean view room, the view was fabulous. The room was nicely decorated, everything worked fine. It was nice to have a safe in the room. There's also a small fridge, and a market across the street. Two great breakfast places were across the street, by the market, Mi Casita, and the bakery. Mi Casita has $2.50 bfast special everyday. Subway and some other fast food restaurants are also across the street. The hotel food is way overpriced. Breakfast was like $14 min. We didn't eat at the hotel except for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, which, of course, was the best steak ever. There's also a casino in the hotel, nickel slots are were it's at! I had a few good nights in Biddyville, as my husband called it. (There were lots of older women playing the nickel slots)The guy in the gift shop even went to another hotel to get my size in a shirt I wanted. Free towels and bottled water at the pool everyday. The pool needs a review all on its own. That was the most fabulous pool I have been to, and I've been to a lot. Rock formations, water falls, bridge, swim up bar, it is sooo nice! I do not recommend renting a car, unless you have terrific navagational skills. The streets seem very difficult to navigate. The taxi was well worth it. The bus was less expensive by far, but took like half an hour to wait on, then twice as long to get there as a taxi. This website helped me choose our vacation, so I hope my review has helped you. I highly recommend the Intercontinental Hotel and Casino in San Juan. We cannot wait to go back.

<Content>Loved this hotel The Inetercontinental Hotel and Casino in SanJuan , Puerto Rico was better than expected. It is a 4 star hotel in the Isle Verde section of San Juan. The cleanliness of the room,and friendliness of the staff was beyond our expectations. Whether we needed concierge assistance, or a question answered at the front desk, our needs were met promptly. The food and drinks at the hotel were expensive, but not more so than the El SanJuan next door. We had an oceanview room with a magnificent view, and our room was spacious enough to accomodate the 3 people in our party. I would definitely stay at this hotel if I returned to San Juan, and would recommend it to anyone planning an upcoming trip to the area.

<Content>Nice Hotel This was a nice hotel. It was clean, the rooms were nice, the grounds kept very well, and service from all staff (from bellman to housekeeping) was top notch. The food at the Splash Bar (pool bar) and at the Mediterranian Cafe (beach front) was so-so. The breakfast in the mornings at the hotel restaurant was very good, and the Japanese restaurant was excellent. Isla Verde seemed to be a very nice area of Puerto Rico. My husband had stayed prior to my arrival for a meeting at the Westin Resort...probalby 40-45 minutes away from Isla Verde. He said he liked this better. This was maybe a 5min cab ride to the airport, and about 15min cab ride to Old San Juan. Old San Juan was interesting, but it's really hot and most of the shops sell the same things. Go to see the history and have lunch...go back to your hotel for nightlife. Right next door to the Intercontinental is the El San Juan. Go to their rooftop restaurants (one Mexican food, one Ranch Style)...the views are great and the atmosphere is good. They also have a club, but we didn't stay long enough to really get the feel for it. I'm sure if you're in the mood for dancing and a 'clubby' atmosphere it would be just fine! All in all, I'd recommend the Intercontinental over other hotels we saw.

<Content>Average pricey 4 stars hotel Much better than the Casino El San Juan next door. Pricey for what you get. The beach is average and what is it with Japanese Steak house in Puerto Rico? There is two of them in a quarter of a mile. The service was good and we got some of the best mojito ever. (At $9.00 each, they better be good鈥? Great pool but little activities for the children. Overall what you would expect from an average 4 stars hotel.

<Content>Great service but get your wallet ready.... My husband and I just returned from our 3 night, 4 day trip to San Juan Puerto Rico. I am starting a new job next week so I was really excited about getting in a (much deserved) vacation. I searched and searched for the perfect spot to go and wound up booking at the Intercontinental Resort and Casino. We had never been to PR so we had no idea what to expect. We arrived and took a quick $15 cab ride from the airport to the hotel, $15 for a 5 minute cab ride seemed excessive but what the heck...we were in Puerto Rico! We checked in and found our Garden View room overlooked the roof of the restuarant but beyond that was a beautiful blue ocean so I got over it. We headed down to lunch and found that the cheapest thing on the menu was a veggie wrap for $10. This was about the time we realized this was not going to be a cheap trip. I will spare you the play by play but the moral of this story is that Puerto Rico (the Intercontinental specifically) is very expensive. The Intercontinental is a nice hotel...I say nice, not great, and far from fabulous compared to several other Intercontinental's that I have stayed at in the past. It is far away from any other restaurants or shopping so if you want to get a meal outside of the hotel, get ready to pay AT LEAST $40 roundtrip to get anywhere else, same goes for shopping. The casino was okay, but very small and very smokey. The pool is very nice...this is where I spent the majority of my stay. The spa is nice but the doors to the rooms are very thin. Throughout my 55 minute massage I heard a little kid who had been dropped off in the reception area crying for her mother while she recieved a massage in the room next to me. I will close with the fact that the hotel was nice and the service was great but I would not reccomend this to anyone who plans to explore anything outside of the hotel. My reccomendation is to stay in the Old San Juan area. It is chock full of restuarants, bars, and shops (The Parrot Club is a must!). I was told that this was the ghetto area but quite honestly the whole of San Juan that I saw resembles the ghetto and Old Town was the most fun. P.S. If you are thinking of booking a trip to PR within the next month or two, talk to the tourism commission. The PR gov't is having a bit of a economic setback at the moment and all public employees (schools, hospitals, gov't agencies, etc.) are unemployeed due to the current elected party. We heard several different versions from those who felt one way or the other about the govenor in office but nonetheless there was a lot of unrest and demostrating going on while we were there.

<Content>Disgusting service - No comparison to other Intercontinental's This hotel is in no way up to par with other Intercontinental's in Latin America/worldwide. Service in EVERY respect is terrible, from the housekeeping that does not show up until 5:00 PM despite repeated requests for service to the absolute zero service in the casino. I was playing $25 blackjack tables for HOURS and not one drink order. Finally complained to management and even the blackjack dealer was literally screaming for a waiter to take orders wihtout success. The bathroom is tiny, the shampoo/amenities sorely lacking and the bed is worn out. Nasty hot tub with brown water and absolute dirty bed linens/bedspread shows this property in desperate need of repair. For $300 a night, stay elsewhere. Never again will I stay here. Nasty nasty nasty is all I can say about this hotel. Oh, the Ruth's Chris restaurant/service is excellent, but stay elsewhere and go there to eat. The Intercontinental is nothing more than a rundown Holiday Inn. I agree with the previous post...this place is dangerous for familie and children as well. The bathroom at the beach was used by non-guests and very dirty. I had my towel actually stolen at the beach when I went to the room for 30 mins. to check email! Not safe and dirty in general!

<Content>Nice place, thin walls The location for this hotel is good--close to the airport on a beautiful beach (but the taxis rip you off charging you $10.50 for a five minute ride!). The room was spacious and the beds are very comfortable. Our room had a beach view that was beautiful and the hotel provides complimentary plush beach towels, chairs, and umbrellas. But be prepared to listen to your neighbors because the walls are extra thin. We could hear people coming in and out of their rooms all night long. The rooms were very clean and we didn't have any problems checking in. The hotel is close to other hotels and shops, so dining was easy. The neighboring El San Juan Hotel has an amazing salsa club with live music on many nights. We stayed away from the casino because we're not gamblers and we've been to Vegas. We'd recommend skipping breakfast in the hotels and walking across the street to the mini-mall that has breakfast places (e.g., a bakery) for less than $5 per person. There's also a great homestyle Puerto Rican (Criollo) restaurant across the street-their asopao de pollo (chicken soup) was delicious and inexpensive. We'd recommend skipping the hotel restaurants unless you'd like to really pay a lot for a nice meal.Be forewarned, this hotel is not near Old San Juan--if you plan to go to Old San Juan, it's a pretty costly taxi ride ($20 one way). But we took the public bus instead (75 cents per person) and it gave us a great tour of the city and it stops right in Old San Juan at the bus terminal. The bus was clean and operated very efficiently but take exact change. Just ask the concierge about travel in and around Old San Juan-he was very helpful.Note: We did not pay for our stay at the hotel (business trip with extended stay for vacation). But we felt the price of the hotel was reasonable considering the convenience of its location to the beach, restaurants, casinos, and nearby hotels. If you're planning on catching more culture and nightlife in Old San Juan, we'd recommend staying in Old San Juan. The Intercontinental is good for a relaxing time on the beach.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Just got back from a weeklong trip staying at the Intercon Hotel in Isla Verde area. We had a decent sized room (king bed, sofa) facing the ocean. It does make a big difference when you get that view and open your sliding door for a nice breeze off the ocean. The higher your floor the better the view. People have complained about the walls being very thin and hearing everybody else but honestly it depends who is staying next to you. It's pretty much luck of the draw. Tell the front desk if your neighbors are too loud. They'll handle it for you. The hotel is very very close to the airport so that's good but also bad in some respects. Only an $11 cab ride (5 min) away but you can hear the boom of the planes arriving and departing close by. Bewteen 11 pm and 7 am the airport has very minimal activity. The pool area is very spacious with plenty of comfy chairs to claim. The staff is very attentive and accommodating to help you enjoy your stay there. There are two bars/restaurants at the pool area, one closer to the beach and one has a swim up bar. The Splash swim up bar makes their drinks better than the Ciao restaurant. Definitely important when your paying $8 per drink plus tipping. Food at both places is your typical bar food. Pricier because of the convenience of eating right there at the poolside/beachsisde. You can walk right across the street to a few places for cheaper breakfast/lunch food (i.e. Subway). The beach outside the hotel is decent but the ocean water surprisingly has lots of seaweed. They have water activities such as jet skiing, parasailing, banana boat. Isla Verde beach area allows you to take nice walks up and down the coast. The hotel offers you chairs and umbrellas for the beach as a guest, free of charge, just throw a few $ tip to the guys busting their butts hauling them out for you. They have a decent gym overlooking the ocean close to the beach. It's included in your stay. The hotel has a few different restaurants- sushi, steak, italian, breakfast buffet. Did all of them except for the italian. Enjoyed all of them, little pricier but that's expected for hotel standards. The casino is pretty good, open every day from 10am-4am. Guy sells cigars in front of it during the evening. Little bar in the lobby area with salsa playing music in the evenings. If you plan on hanging in the lobby area during the evening bring a sweatshirt, it's cold in there! People actually hang out in there because it's nice. The concierge desk was very helpful to us in planning dinners and various other activities. Highly recommend Nestor or Joselle. All in all it was a very nice place and the weather in PR was great, obviously the reason people go to the island for vacationing. Would stay there again if we visited PR again. El San Juan hotel next door is pretty sweet with a cool lobby/ bar area but it's also much more expensive.

<Content>Paradise Found ! My husband and I just returned from a 6 day stay during Easter week at the Intercontinental. It was one of the best vacations of our lives. We were treated like royalty by the entire staff the whole time we were there. We were upgraded for free to an ocean view on the 10th floor. What a view from the balcony!!! The beach is beautiful. The lounge chairs and small tables are free and they will place them anyplace on the beach that you like. Umbrellas cost $10 to rent, but to save money we put our chairs under the palm trees when we wanted shade. There is a small shopping mall across the street where you could buy food to picnic on the beach. We bought food from Subway and there is a small bakery there. You could also walk to Burger King and Wendy鈥檚. You could be lazy and order food on the beach, but it is expensive. We did that one day and it cost us $42. We were lucky because we had a 25% discount on all food and beverages through Liberty Travel Agency. The hotel has beautiful pools with waterfalls, a swim up splash bar and a jacuzzi. The lounges around the pool are very cushiony and comfortable. The concierge is excellent. Through Nestor we booked a tour to El Yunque Rainforest and Luquillo Beach. It was through E  B tours with a man named Jos茅 Antonio(Joey). It was an all day tour. He arrived in his Ford Windstar van with 2 other couples and 1 child. It was a nice small group of 7 people. We left at 9:30 AM and returned at 6PM. We saw all of the important sites in the rainforest and were able to swim in La Mina Falls. He gave us so much interesting information. We arrived at the famous Luquillo Beach at 2:30 and spent the rest of the day there. We had the buffet breakfast every day which was included in our package from Liberty travel. There was a great selection of items and you could get things cooked to order like special omelets, eggs done anyway you like them or waffles, and pancakes. They changed some of the hot items every day. One day there were blintzes, another breakfast burritos, poached eggs with sweet plantains and different kinds of potatoes. We sat outside near the pool area. For dinner we ate at the Ciao Mediterranean caf茅 on the beach, the Ponderosa across the street where we had lobster tails, the 10th floor of the Howard Johnson鈥檚 Hotel (8 blocks away) which has a beautiful Italian restaurant called La Fontana with a view of the harbor and a restaurant at the end of our beach which juts out into the water called the Oceanview or Sonny鈥檚 restaurant. The food was very good and the view of the harbor was beautiful. It was not expensive.I will definitely return to this hotel again. I am only home 2 days and I miss being there already.

<Content>Had an awesome vacation! My boyfriend and I just got back (yesterday) from our 5 night vacation at the Intercontinental. We had a great time with very few complaints about the hotel. I would have to say the only real problem was the thin walls (as previous reviewers have stated). If you're unlucky to have inconsiderate neighbors, you'll hear doors slamming and conversations in the hallway and the rooms next door. At 3:00 AM, this was not an ideal situation. Fortunately, it didn't happen every night. We had a city view on the 11th floor and although the balcony is small with only one chair, we were able to bring the room chair outside and be very comfortable having morning coffee or an evening cocktail. The room itself was clean but nothing special. However, this was just fine since we didn't spend a whole lot of time there. The maid service was excellent. The pool and beach areas couldn't be better. You can rent an umbrella ($10) at the towel stand and there's plenty of plush towels and free water. There are also plenty of waiters on the beach if you'd like to have drinks or food brought to you. The gym was just OK. There were four treadmills, one stairmaster, two recumbent bikes and plenty of weights. The spa area is small but sufficient and everybody is really very nice.If you're looking for some salsa dancing, go next door to the El San Juan. The bands were great!Overall, we had a great vacation and would definitely stay at the Intercontinental again. I would be happy to answer any questions if you'd like to contact me. This was my fourth time to Puerto Rico and last year, I stayed at the Wyndham El San Juan.

<Content>Great hotel! We stayed at the Intercontinental March 24th, 2006 for 3 days following at sailboat charter in the BVI. It was great to have such a nice hotel to look forward to after roughing it for a week! We loved this place! Everyone was so friendly, rooms clean, pool area great-plenty of chairs, beach location excellent. We had a top floor room facing the ocean and could hear the waves all night when we left our door open! The casino was fun-small, but we're not big gamblers. By the way, they don't adhere to the dress code in the casino that they tell you. (Which was good for us because we didn't have room to pack nice clothes and extra shoes other than sandals on the boat. They do make you wear shoes and shirts in the lobby). There are so many helpful personnel standing around everywhere. The concierge was especially helpful in getting us around San Juan and trying out restaurants. Our ONLY gripe was our room not being ready when we arrived, but we just went down and had a drink at the beach bar, so it wasn't really a big problem. We would love to go back to San Juan, as 3 days was not enough time, and will definately stay here again.

<Content>Nice hotel....Here are a few tips My husband and I stayed at the Intercontinental in March and on the whole we were very pleased. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They upgraded our room at no extra charge. The pool was lovely and the beaches sufficient. We really appreciated security ever present and that staff was waiting with towels and water after a morning run. The location is great. Close enough to the ESJ for a night of fun and some great food but far enough away for peace and quiet and minutes from the airport. Our room was lovely. Our two complaints would be the doors are very loud. On Saturday night we heard doors slamming all nigh. Not very restful. Try to request a room at the end of the hall. The shampoo is horrible. Fortunately there was a walgreens right down the street and the problem was solved with a $1.25.If you are not a big breakfast eater, we highly recommend the bakery in the strip mall across the street. Great baked goods, ham egg  cheese sandwiches, and a mean cup of coffee. The owner is very nice and remembers how you like your coffee after one day. Another food tip...walk to the end of the beach (to the right) there is a little dive hotel (not the bar hanging over the edge) at the end. Walk through the motel and you will see an amazing view of the ocean, have a great burger, a cold beer, all for a few bucks. Great find!We loved Puerto Rico. There is as much or as little as you want to do. One last warning!!! Check over your bill before check out. We were charged for things we did not eat and were charged for parking a car we never had. Once pointed out, they corrected it without a fuss. We would recommend this hotel. Clean, friendly staff, and decent amenities.

<Content>Perfect quick getaway! A friend and I stayed at the Intercontinental for 3 nights in March and loved it. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were fine (not luxurious, but more than adequate) and the pool and beach were great. Despite there being 2 conferences at the hotel while we were there, it never felt overcrowded. The food was good and the drinks hit the spot. We loved how easy it was to get to from the aiport and took advantage a great little coffee shop across the street and a small grocery store to save $ on breakfast. All in all, my friend and I would both definitely return, either with our families or for another girls' weekend.

<Content>Loved InterContinental San Juan Resort We just got back from Puerto Rico and stayed at the InterContinental San Juan Resort prior to our cruise. We loved it! It was so beautiful and breath taking. We stayed on the 16th floor which over looked the ocean. The pool was beautiful and very relaxing. Security was tight in the pool area making sure you were a guest at the hotel. We also had breakfast at the hotel and was very plesed. You get what you pay for. Yes, it is expensive, however you have a big variety of food to choose from if you do the buffet. The staff was very helpful and nice. I would definetly stay their again!

<Content>Intercontinental overpriced! Stayed at the IC on March 16 - 18th. Four ladies and two rooms. Arrived at IC at 5:00pm and one of our rooms wasn't ready until 6:00pm. Was given a complimentary drink at the bar while two of us had to wait for our room to be cleaned.Public areas are very pretty. The rooms are absoultly no more than average. They seem worn. Caulk in the bathroom was old, not well done and yellowish. The beds were fine. The balcony VERY tiny but at least for the most part a beatiful ocean view (it also overlooked lots of roof tops that were not pleasing to look at).If we hadn't paid so much for the room it would be one thing but to pay these prices I expect alot more for the money. Staff was friendly but slow at checkin. Pool was GREAT! Big, clean fun to be at! Beach was very nice. I did appreciate the security they had around the hotel. I would probably not stay here again as I think we could have gotten a better place to stay for the money we spent.

<Content>Fantastic staff, beautiful hotel, a great option..... My girlfriend and I recently stayed at the Intercontinental for 5 days and 4 nights. We are 28  29 yrs old and we were looking for something other than a spring break place, but we also didn't want to stay in a 'honeymoon type' resort. The Intercontinental proved to be a great selection. The staff is extremely pleasant  helpful, always greeting you with a smile. The beach is great, with a cool little beach bar/cantina run by the hotel where you can enjoy a cocktail or some lunch while just steps from your beach chair. The pool is also very attractive and is great for a quick swim, but we're more beach people. The lobby bar and restaurants are totally sufficient if not exceptional. However, the El San Juan, known for it's fantastic nightlife( mediocre rooms) is literally right next door. We also had dinner and drinks at the Water Club, Isla Verde's new trendy 'boutique' hotel  it was also within walking distance. We had a very nice oceanview room on the 12th floor with a tremendous view. All in all, we had a great time at the Intercontinital and we would recommend it to any of our friends. I can't say enough about the staff and how nice they were.

<Content>A truly wonderful experience! We are frequent travelers and have been to several Caribbean destinations. We don't cruise, so our experiences have not been limited to port areas or 1 night stays either. That being said, we are totally enchanted with the island of Puerto Rico! We just returned from our 5 night stay at the Intercontinental Hotel there and couldn't be happier with the service and accomodations received. I know the details below are long winded, feel free to skim, but I'd rather give too much info than too little. We are all unique and what means something to one doesn't always mean the same to others. Bottom line is, Puerto Rico and the Intercontinental are both tops in our book!Location - The hotel is a short $11US taxi ride from the airport. It is very close to the airport, but so are ALL the hotels in the Isle Verde/Carolina section. Airplane noise was noticable out by the pool during peak times, so keep that in mind if you are sensitive to it and maybe look for a hotel away from the airport. Definitely no fault of this hotel and to be honest, we didn't notice any airport noise from inside our room (facing the ocean, not the city).Pool - The pool is in a class by itself! The combination swim up/walk up bar is partially covered to provide shade most of the day for people who want to park there and drink without becoming a lobster. The pool bar has 3 tv's and plenty of name brand alcohol. Everything can be charged to your room, no need to bring cash to the pool area. There is also a small footbridge, several shallow ledges for in-pool suning, and (best of all) a multi-waterfall simulated rock formation with all kinds of places to sit/stand under them. A small section of the pool gets 6'+ deep and is clearly marked by bouy lines. The rest is generally between 3' and 5'+. Hot tub is huge and connected to the pool for easy in/out between the two. Plenty of areas to get shade and sun around the pool. Thick cushioned loungers with lots of tables and umbrellas are usually able to be had with not too much trouble. Towels are easy to get and plentiful as is all the FREE bottled water you can drink. Drink service was almost always at hand and not bothersome if you didn't want it. If you are a pool person, this is your place to be.Beach - Soft, beige sand is perfect for long, barefoot walks. Not too crowded. Surf is just rough enough to be interesting, perfect for the body surfer. Lots of watersports options nearby. Beaches are public but not overrun by pushy vendors (we saw very few at all). Only knock was the above average amount of seaweed in the first 10-15 yards of surf. Most hotels on the beach issue their guests daily ID braclets to get back in.Room - The shower is the best we have ever, and I mean EVER, had! It is what all showers in the world should be designed after! Holds the temperature, gets as hot as you want (or not), easy to operate and the water pressure is like a small fire hose. Did I mention we liked the shower? A small refrigerator is in the room stocked with a couple beers, a couple waters, some soda... any of which will be charged to your room if consumed. The great part about it is there are no sensors inside, so you can move things around and use the ample extra space for your own perishables. The king bed was very comfortable, pillows were just OK, plenty of blankets if you want them. Enough drawer and closet space for 2 people on an average stay. Large desk and sofa in the sitting area. Balcony was too small, but better than none at all. Sliding glass door lets the Caribbean air wash right into the room. A/C works really, really well (too well sometimes) and sound is on the level of white noise. TV gets several popular US  PR channels. Iron  ironing board. In-room safe with self-program code and lots of room inside. Plenty of mirrors and lights around them to see what you're doing. Like most hotels, you can probably hear through the walls if you really try (like say putting your ear up to it), but just sitting in the room we heard nothing on either side of us. One big problem we had was being right outside the elevator and several exuberant guests seemed to think nothing of shouting down halls and slamming doors at all hours. No matter where you are, please remember if you're in the hallway everyone can hear you.Food - Pool  beach bars offered some great lunch type food which ranged from the native (Puerto Rican specialties) to the ordinary (Burgers  Pizza). All were very good with no lingering effects. La Terraza was also very good. Room service at breakfast was prompt, accurate and the food was delcious. We did not try the other restaurants at the hotel since there were so many other options on Isle Verde and Old San Juan. One night we ate at Metropol with mixed results. My pork was way too fatty, but her beef dish was very good. Our best food experience was at Dragonfly in Old San Juan. Simply to die for. Slightly larger than Tapas style portions designed to mix and share. Get the mongolian beef, it's sublime! Parrot Club was great too. El San Juan hotel next door has several restaurants of which we tried two. The Italian one (next to Palms) was excellent. The Mexican one... wasn't. But I digress, back to the hotel.Casino/Lobby Bar - Casino is a decent size, never really too crowded. The one and only $5 min Blackjack table fills up quickly at night with the $10 min table right behind it. Minimums don't change with the time of day. There is a dress code after 6, somewhat enforced. Slots range from 1 cent to $25, most are 5 cents. One Roulette wheel, a couple craps tables (usually only 1 going), a few poker tables and some other misc tables (let it ride, caribbean stud, etc.). Drink service at at the casino was spotty. My advice is have a back up plan for entertainment because the house seemed to have some uncanny streaks of good luck. The lobby bar seemed quite nice to lightly mix and mingle or listen to some music, but to see and be seen the place to go seemed to be next door at El San Juan.Spa - I had a Swedish massage, 55 min for $85 plus gratuity. Nice clean facilities and the staff are very friendly. As for the massage, I've had better and I've had worse. Sorry I can't be of more help than that.Service - Exceptional. Upgraded at check in. Housekeeping did a great job throughout the stay (1 day it could have been a little quicker). The lobby was always full of hotel personnel ready to answer any questions. There was an Instant Service button on the room phone which immediately connected to someone who greated us by name and addressed any issues we had immediately, then followed up to ensure we were satisfied. Tour desk people were extremely helpful and the tour guides we had were simply the best. The service at this hotel was among the best of any we've stayed at in the Caribbean. No surprises at check out either.Misc Stuff - You can do as little or as much as you like at this hotel and in Puerto Rico in general. We took the rainforest tour with Castillo Tours, ask for Conzavos (a.k.a. Papa Lion), the 2nd best tour guide in Puerto Rico (he'll explain why). We also did the Old San Juan  Bacardi Rum tour with Antonio who went above and beyond to help us. We can't wait to return!

<Content>Exceeded my expactations, too I have stayed at this hotel in its previous lives, Americana, Sands, etc. and there was always something not right. This time everything was perfect, from the staff to the facilities. The WiFI worked wonderfully in the rooms and the lobby, and it was free. As I was there on business, I was very pleased with that!

<Content>Nice Start My Family and I stayed at the intercontinental for a few days before going on a cruise. The hotel was clean and very comfortable. The pool and beach areas were above average although very crowded (School vacation week). My one issue was the service staff. Although they always smiled they seemed to have a difficult time getting things done and done right. For example every day we were there they would run out of complimentary coffee in the cafe and could never seem to get anyone to refill them. Overall I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Had a fabulous trip and can't wait to go back Spent a week at the Intercontinental in San Juan abd I highly recommend this hotel. It's one of the nicest we've ever stayed at. However, I want to emphasize the benefit of staying on the ocean front side. We stayed on both (ocean and city) and found the experiences to be like night and day! Facing the ocean you feel like you are on a Caribbean island. You have a beautiful view (the higher the better) of the ocean and pool. It's great having the sliding glass doors open and getting the ocean sound and breeze. Across the hall, you feel like you are at an airport hotel. It is loud from the airport and city noises and you don't want the curtains open. The pool was terriffic with waterfalls and a swim up bar. The beach was very nice. The staff was exceptionally pleasant; from the pool attendants to the waiters and especially the front desk staff. The Japanesse restaurant was one of the best we've ever dined at. Much better than the one at the El San Juan. The food at the pool was great, but huge portions. We learned to order 2 meals for 4 people. The restaurant on the beach is nice, but allow plenty of time to wait. They have a small pizza oven and many orders. The Ranch restaurant at the El San Juan was fun for kids and had great atmosphere. Renting a car was easy - right in the hotel. Maria and Hector (Avis desk) were very helpful. Loved the Rain Forest. Had a great Italian meal in Old San Juan at Sophia's. The nice part about staying at the Intercontinental is that you are in they City and can access other restaurants and sight seeing, but you don't have to leave the hotel to experience a great, relaxing vacation!

<Content>Great Staff  The very goods for our experience here last week; concierge, almost all of the staff was very attentive, welcoming, and friendly; pool is very nice, beach is expansive and great for walking; we ate at the less expensive places at the hotel and found the food to be pretty good overall; there are also a couple of local places nearby particularly for breakfast and the next door hotel offers rooftop dining with a great view.The issue with the hotel revolved around the rooms for us; the room was large enough but we had noise issues with rooftop ventilation from outside and random noises throughout the night that sounded like someone dragging their chair across the floor. Also, door and bathroom sink were chipped/dreary. For the rate we paid for the room these things are really not acceptable. When I called the front desk to ask around a different room assignment because of the roof ventilation noise, they said they would send an engineer up to check out the noise but we waited for a while and no one showed up or followed up at all. Seems like they probably get lots of complaints about the rooms and don't take them too seriously.Overall, the positive staff attitude and pool area really made this a very good vacation for us.

<Content>Great trip to the InterContinental My family of four (two daughters, ages 9 and 13) just stayed at the InterContinental from Feb. 18-25, and had a wonderful time. Some info/impressions, in no particular order:-- Great pool. Really great pool. Waterfalls, a little footbridge to swim under, beautifully landscaped, great upkeep. --The lounges around the pool go early. I got out there by 8 to secure 3 in the shade. But....--The chaises by the beach (which the staff will set up for you) seem to be available all day. I've heard that you have to get there early-ish for an umbrella, though.--The beach is really nice -- nice for long walks, really good for sand castle building. The water was warmer than the pool! Some seaweed, but there was only one day when it was TOO much seaweed. Soft sand; no water shoes needed.--On the beach, walk to the right (toward the El San Juan) for boating activities. My kids and husband went parasailing (they were each harnessed in with him, so he went up twice) and that was a definite highlight of the week for them. Costs about $60 each. The banana boat ride was more.....um....exciting than we thought it would be, judging from how it looks from the shore. Don't bring your glasses or camera, because you WILL be tossed off the boat at some point. You'll either think that's fun, or not. One of my daughters loved it; the other sobbed. --Unbelievably great, friendly service. Without exception. The concierge service is particularly wonderful, particularly Nestor. --One complaint: The walls of the room are thin. This is no problem unless you have really loud neighbors. There was only one point during the week when we were bothered, when our neighbor started blasting loud rap at 5:30 a.m. I called downstairs, and security came right up and knocked on their door (and knocked and knocked, until they finally turned off the music....but then we could hear what the music was drowning out: Oh baby.....OH BABY BABY! OH OH OH!). --We had a garden/pool view room, which was facing the ocean...in fact, we could see the ocean just fine! All this means is that it's on a lower floor (we were on 6). So I wouldn't pay extra for ocean view, unless you spend lots of time on the balcony. (The balconies are small -- just one chair and a small table.)-- Food: We had two TERRIFIC meals at Ruth Chris's steakhouse, and a really nice meal at Passagio, the italian place. (That has a dress code: no flip flops or shorts.) Nice breakfast each day at the buffet. Dinner one night at the restaurant down on the beach (Ciao Mediterranean--get the pizza!).-- We had dinner one night at Metropol, which is within walking distance, and has nice authentic local food. Fun place. Had dinner one night at Tequila Grill, which is on the 10th floor of El San Juan (rude hostess--that's the only rudeness I encountered all week). Great view, okay Mexican food. There's also a place called The Ranch on that floor. Both casual. --El Morro is a wonderful trip.--Old San Juan: I had a great time wandering around on my own. If you're not going to do a tour, have the cabbie drop you at El Convento hotel, wander up and down that hill (has outlet stores, if you're into that, but also nice historical things: San Juan Cathedral, San Juan Gate one block west (? toward the water)), then walk down to San Francisco or the street directly after that (LaFortenza, or something) and turn left for some nice local shops. Got some very nice stuff at Puerto Rico Arts and Crafts, which is on LaFortenza (or whatever). I ran into a funeral procession, complete with singing and drums, and masked dancers. An amazing sight.--The casino's nothing special, if you're into that. We're not, so didn't matter. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel -- we'd definitely go back.

<Content>Great location, great pool, small rooms terrible price! We stayed at the hotel this past feb. and we thought the location was great, being 5 minutes from the airport and walking distance to other hotels. The pool was awsome, comfy chairs and plush towels, and free water! Great drinks as well for 8.00US! The food was good, very consistant.Now for the bad news, the rooms are dated and not sound proof at all! We would wake up to the other rooms phone ringing or alarm going off. Or to some jerk talking in the hall on his cell phone at 2AM. We heard word for word what he was saying! They are also in need of a reno- the shower head was hanging by a thread in our bathroom! For the 300US plus hidden fees we paid, I didn't think it was worth it! For that price go stay at the Beverly Hilton!

<Content>Nice hotel, for half the price We just returned from 5 nights at the Intercontinental San Juan. I have never felt the need to write anything but a positive review for hotels. Don't get me wrong. This is a nice hotel and the doormen are very friendly. However we have traveled quite a bit in the Carribean and for the price I would not stay at the IC again. The front desk are almost rude as well as some of the other staff. For $200-$300 a night this would be a great hotel but it is definately NOT a four star resort. The rooms are small and noisy and the sad part is that management at the hotel seemed to be bothered when issues were brought up. For $439 a night plus tax and a $48 hotel service charge we expected much more. A lesson learned I guess.

<Content>3 star Hotel, tiny rooms, tiny bathrooms wow.The BAD: I paid $400 a night and this room was tiny. The bathroom is cruise ship small. The layout of the hotel is confusing. The food is crazy expensive/bad. The service is ok. The gym is ok.The Good: Wonderful, shaded pool. If you want sun go to the beach. Nice sand, warm water. Casino was nice.

<Content>Nice for a short trip After staying at the Wyndham El San Juan Hotel and Casino for over ten years we decided to try the Intercontinental next door. We had an ocean front room with a king size bed. The room itself was narrow and quite smallas was the bathroom. The balcony had room for only one chair and a small table. There were two connecting doors on either side of the room, allowing us to hear every word our neighbors were saying. We spoke with the manager and were told every room was the same size. I found the service to be fantastic everywhere in this hotel. Unfortunately I would not stay here again because of the room size. When paying top dollar for an ocean front room there are other hotels offerring more for the money. Next try will be the Westin, where the rooms appear to be much larger.

<Content>Feb stay at Intercontintal We just got back from 4 nights at the Intercontinental. The location is the best..beautiful beach...The service was wonderful..everyone was terrific including Maria at the Avis table and the concierge. The room, city view, was clean and well cared for but a little tired. We ate at the Japanese and Italian restaurants..they were very good.The little touches such as free bottled water at the pool were indicative of the level of service this hotel provides. I would strongly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Wanted to love the InterContinental, had to settle for the Holiday Inn instead I selected the IC based on a good bit of research, including reviews at TripAdvisor. We made our reservation back in October for our Feb 3 stay....but sadly, did not get a chance to stay there. IC called me 3 days prior to arrival to let me know that they could not honor my reservation because a 'large group' was staying there. While this was never quite explained to me, the IC was kind enough to 1) give me advance notice 2) book us into the their sister hotel (Holiday Inn San Juan) and 3) comp our first night's stay there. So, while I was disappointed with the change (there is no reasonable way to compensate for switching to a 2-star hotel 2 blocks off the beach from a 4-star hotel on the beach), the IC did work with me to make it as right. We had a smooth check-in at the Holiday Inn SJ, a great room, and use of the IC grounds as though we were guests. All detailed in a letter sent to me by the IC's revenue manager (maybe that explains it?).

<Content>Spendid experience 3 nights stay - great experience. Nestor (concierge) and Irene Perez (hostess) very helpful and professional. Service workers throughout friendly, helpful. 2 good theme restaurants for steak and Asian cross-over. (Didn't try the Italian spot b/c the Italian restaurant next store in the El San Juan is probably the best food in PR). Recommend Metropole (3 blocks) for authentic PR food and Parrot Club in Old SJ for same.Walked the streets, took local busses -- interesting and safe. Good market across the street for in-room fridge supplies.Beach and pool outstanding.If you don't like this experience, either stay home or be prepared to pay 2 - 3 times for some chic place in Hawaii.(Also drove to Rincon - spectacularly beautiful shore-line, surf and the real deal for surfers.)

<Content>Excellent location, but bad service/price ratio We stayed at the Intercontinental from 01/27/06 until 02/03/06. In short: a very good location but a very low average level of the hotel's guests, no controls and no appropriate interventions from hotel's officers and a very bad service/price ratio. A few examples.At the swimming pool, pool attendants, except those who hand over the towels but don't make anything else (I have unsuccessfully asked to be helped on with the placing of an umbrella ),are nonexistent; still at the pool, where chairs are extremely close each other, one day ny four neighbours had lunch with cans and foods picked up at a nearby supermarket, thus disseminating all around stinks and garbage, but evidently the hotel management allows it; inside there is one bar only, unbelievably noisy due to the music always kept at full volume,but with no alternatives; the waitresses of the bar are very uncultured and one of them didn't know the existence of something called sherry; many of the hotel's guests wear baseball caps and Stetson in the evening even in the bar and the restaurants and have a behaviour which would be very indulgent to define as coarse; the hotel's shop has only a couple of local and of American newspapers, and that's all;etc.Obviously my complaints would be of little importance, if any, should I refer to a third class hotel, but I am talking about an Intercontinental with room rates justifiable only for a high class hotel.In conclusion, the excellent location of the Intercontinental in Portorico, just on the beach and very close to the airport, is surely a positive aspect but absolutely insufficient to compensate all the negative ones ( and I have mentioned only a few of them ).

<Content>Just okay We just spent 2 nights in late January 2006 here. We go to San Juan 2-3 times per year and usually stay at the Marriott Resort in the Condado. We wanted to try the Isla Verde area for something different this trip. So, much of this review will be comparing this resort to the Marriott.First off, if you are new to Puerto Rico, you have to understand that an upscale hotel there will not be as nice as what you'll find in the States. They are made of concrete, so there's more noise. The furnishings are not as nice. Rooms are often musty due to being seaside. The staff is on an island schedule, so you have to be patient.Second, I have to commend the professionalism of the staff at the Intercontinental....better than any other place we've stayed.In a nutshell, this hotel would be good if it were less expensive. It is in many respects very similar to the Marriott Condado, just more pricey. The rooms are similar, but noisier (doors slam more loudly and the airplanes fly much closer to it with the airport nearby). The rooms were like an Omni, a Courtyard or Marriott in the States....not elegant by any stretch.The casino is okay, but no better than Marriott's and not as nice as the El San Juan nearby or El Convento in Old San Juan. The neighborhood is certainly not one where you want to walk after dark. There are grocery stores and fast food places nearby for during the daytime. No boutiques, cafes or nicer souvenir places like in the Condado.The gym is so-so, as most are down there. The pool area can't compare with Marriott's or with others I've seen. The stretch of beach it's on was quite dirty, partly due to wintertime when winds stir up more seaweed. However, it was nice to be able to jog on the beach for 1.5 or 2 miles thru Isla Verde....in front of all the hotels, etc. Fun to people watch there, too.Stay here if you can get a good deal on it, but not if it's more than $200 per night on-season.

<Content>We thought this place was just terrific.... We decided on San Juan in general because it was an easy and direct flight out of NYC. We booked a package on Orbitz and the Intercontinental was one of the hotel choices for our short 4 night stay. I admit that I had some reservations based on some of the reviews but ended up being extremely satisfied. We took this short trip prior to a 10 day cruise that we are taking in a month and wanted to get some sun and just relax. Despite what we read about the hotel restaurants, we decided not to leave the hotel complex. We ate at the Japanese restaurant the first night, Ruth's Chris the next and Passagio's one night. Each was wonderful but a little on the pricey side. I've been to Ruth's Chris in NYC and was disappointed, but the repeat in San Juan did not disappoint. The Japanese Restaurant was noisy (as expected for tepanyaki) but the food was excellent and the Passagio's was very cozy and excellent overall. The pool area was beautiful and the water refreshing. If you didn't get to the pool early, and I am talking by 10 a.m. you didn't get a chair. Now let me say that I was down there around 9 each day so we were set, but we were also there. There were many chair hogs - meaning that they put either a book or sun tan lotion on the chair and left for hours. Check-in was a breeze and we arrived at noon and were able to get into our room right away. We were sipping a drink by 12:30. We live in CT now, but lived in the City for 6 years. Many reviews mentioned the planes coming and going and the noise level. If you've lived in the City for any period of time and have police sirenes, fire engines and ambulances screaming by at all hours of the day or night, you won't be phased by the planes at all. Our room was on the 5th floor and was very clean - no complaints at all about the room. The bathroom was also very clean but a tad on the small side. Frankly, we didn't spend all that much time in the room during the day since we were there for the sun and were just really there late in the evening so weren't bothered by this at all. We also ate breakfast at the hotel, wasn't great, wasn't bad but was a little pricey. We don't eat all that much and when we have breakfast, we skip lunch so I can't comment on the lunches. Drinks from both the pool bar and lobby bar were very good and the overall service exceptional. For those who would rather venture out and are on a limited budget, the Outback is nearby as is Pizza Hut and several local restaurants that a number of people that we talked to said were very good. All in all, we had a great time and would definitely go back.

<Content>Management failed us We flew in to San Juan a day early for our Cruise and stayed one night at The Intercontinental. We paid $300 for a city view. Not a very nice view, we looked out on dirty hotels and fast food restaurants. Pool area is nice and beach is nice, but be aware beer is $6 a bottle. Bellman was nice helping us with bags and info. Main problem we had with hotel was that a week after we stayed there, we get off cruise @ 8:30am and flight didn't leave until 5:20pm, we go to airport and try to get flight moved up and we can't and they wouldn't let us check in until after 1pm and there's not even a place to sit at airport, the only place we had to turn was The Intercontinental where we had stayed 1 night the week before, so we take a taxi and asked the management if we could just store our luggage and get an armband to be able to use the pool area and use a towel, and their reply was because they were full they couldn't let us. There was only my wife and myself, and we were talking only a few hrs, people were checking out and for those checking in, that time is 4pm, they turned us away. They could have done the right thing and maybe had a repeat customer but next time we'll go next door to the El San Juan, and we'll get an ocean view. If you're looking for a party you won't find it at The Intercontinental It was dead the Fri. night we were there, but had a blast next door at The El San Juan.

<Content>LOVED IT! We got back from from PR last week and had an awesome time! We stayed at the Intercontinental and hit the beach and local restaurants. We loved having the best of both worlds - we had the beach on one side and the city on the other. The IC has clean rooms, a friendly staff, and a beautiful pool and beach area.The concierge was very helpful in directing us to outside restaurants and sightseeing. The rest of the staff was very accomodating to any other requests we had.The IC is expensive but you get what you pay for. It is next door the the Wydnam Casino which is known for the night life. It is also local to a lot of restaurants. The staff at the IC was great for recommending restaurants in the area. The cuisine at the IC was expensive as to be expected at any resort, but there were so many places to go to eat that were right outside the resort - literally a 2 minute walk.Anyway, my husband said that this is where he wants to go again next year. Although the IC was expensive, I think it was worth it. We had lunch at the resort only because it was convenient to the beach, but we saved $$ on breakfast and dinner by taking a walk off the resort. The IC wasn't overcrowded and the staff was very friendly and the rooms were great. Oh yeah - it's a 5 minute taxi ride from the airport and a 10-minute taxi ride to historic Old San Juan.

<Content>Swim Up BAR! POSTIVES-Isla Verde is a great location. The Intercontinental had a great beach and pool area and the staff was very friendly and a SWIM UP BARNEGATIVES--Casino is dumpy, Restaurants expensive. The area- the hotel is right next door to the El San Juan with its gorgeous lobby bar and great scene.Across the street from the Intercontinental is a little strip mall with a tiny supermarket where we picked up bottle water and room necessities. There is also a bunch of fast food places and a small diner which has very good Mofongo (if you are in PR you must try it). Its only a short walk to the Water Club Hotel with its cool roof top bar and great tapas-like restaurant Tangerine.

<Content>Great time at Intercontinental Great hotel, with great service. The beach and pool area are beautiful. Restaurants and bars expensive. However, there's a grocery store and lots of reasonable restaurants literally right accross the street. They sent us a free bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries to our room. We still don't know why. My one complaint is that the king bed rooms were really tiny. We were in a two-double bed room the first night, which was spacious and nice, but we wanted a king bed after that. The king room was not that nice and really small. I thought the veiws were nice from the cityview rooms as well as the others. I don't think it's worth paying for the supposedly better view, unless you're getting the top floor oceanview rooms. All balconies are small, only fit one small chair. The staff was so helpful they were really wonderful.

<Content>Best Hotel in Isla Verde This was our third time staying at the InterContinental. We have stayed twice at the Ritz, twice at the Caribe HIlton and once at the Marriot; however, the InterContinental is our favorite place to stay when we are in San Juan. The grounds are lovely, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff is pleasant and accomodating.  The beach in Isla Verde is fantastic and great for taking long walks. You don't get much of a beach when you stay at the Hilton or at the Hotels on the Condado. Eating at the hotels can be expensive, but there are a few places very close by that serve some great food. The Metropol is our favorite - great Cuban food, not like abuela's, but good! Right across the street from the hotel is a stirp mall. There's a small grocery where you can buy bottle water, snacks and drinks (soda, beer, wine, rum...). There's a place to eat there called Mi Casita - be warned - the service is awful, especially at breakfast time! Food can be good. A few doors down, in the very same strip mall is the Golden Bagel Bakery! Coming from the NYC area, I'm very fussy when it comes to bagels, but this place has some great local pastries and good cafe con leche. You can go there for a very excellant and inexpensive breakfast; or better yet take it to go and bring it back to eat on the hotel balcony or on the beach. One place to never go to eat is the Ocean View! We waited over an hour to get our food, then we just walked out, so who knows how long it really would have taken!

<Content>Fabulous Anniversary Trip My darling husband and I have been looking forward to our 30th wedding anniversary and celebrating with a special trip just to relax in the sun because the anniversary is on January 10th. After much research and looking at all possibilities I decided on the Intercontinental Hotel in San Juan. Hawaii was too expensive for us this year and we were not interested in a long flight. Darling husband was not into a cruise, it's been a busy year and we both just wanted to veg.The Intercontinental is everything we expected and more. The property is beautiful and kept meticulously clean. The pool area is as wonderful as everyone else has been saying on this site and I lived out there all week. The beach is ok but there were little noseeums biting me out there so I was very happy to enjoy the pool area. Also, the water had a lot of seaweed washing up. Husband was happy as long as his drink was cold! We stayed the entire week on priority club points and they upgraded our room after the first night and the view was amazing. We felt like we were sitting in the top of the palm trees with a view of the ocean.I went shopping in Old San Juan and really enjoyed browsing there. The Coach and Dooney and Burke outlets have great prices. Ruth's Chris was excellent as always and we went twice, Passiagio's was ok - mediocre - we went twice also. The ElSanJuan next door is incredible and we had dinner at The Palm for our anniversary and were treated very special. The club concierge had Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us in our room when we arrived as a surprise because it was our anniversary. This hotel has fabulous service, couldn't be nicer or more helpful. We have traveled a lot and stayed at Ritz Carlton and many Marriott Renaissance Hotels but this was probably the best service even than the cruise ships. The staff at this hotel will help you with anything and do it with a smile, they are always asking if everything is ok. We won a few dollars in the casino although it's annoying how long it takes to get paid when you win.My only criticism of this hotel is that they need to upgrade the bed linens and the beds. We slept fine but after the Ritz Carlton and Marriott Renaissance and even Crowne Plaza, I expected the linens to be a little nicer but this is a small complaint, our room was great.We will definitely go again to this property and if you go please give Frances at the Splash Pool Bar a big hello for us!! (great poolside food)

<Content>Intercontinental made my dream come true I always dreamed of taking my family on a dream vacation to the land of my parents birth. The Intercontinental was the host for my quest.The service was impecable and they made us all feel safe and secure.I have never had the opportunity to be waited over from the minute we arrived to the day we left.I was really sad to leave and when I returned home I was already checking for availability to return.I anxiously await, as does my family, my return to Puerto Rico and a stay at the Intercontinental.

<Content>Great Deal in Isla Verde ! I just returned from a week at the Intercontinental (1/4 - 1/10). I was curious as to what my trip was going to be like since me  my bf were so young (we are 20) but we had a fantastic time! For young people isla verde is a great place to go to relax, chill by the beach and pool, and have fun. The drinking age in PR is 18 and alcohol is in no short supply although it can be expensive through the hotel.The GoodIt's a beautiful hotel with nice green plant life and a nice lobby  outside. immediately getting out of the cab we were greeted and helped by the staff outside and it was like that the whole vacation. The hotel staff was amazing in service and hospitality. They always held the door when we were walking in and out of the hotel and always greeted us and chatted with us when we saw them around the hotel. The pool was very nice and large. It has two small waterfalls and a lil cove in the middle of the two that you can sit in. Theres a swim up bar and a nice sized hot tub that was great to relax in. Security was pretty tight with the pool. You have to get a new colored wrist band everyday to get towels and complimentary water bottles. I guess because we were young we got checked a lot by security to make sure we were guests but it wasnt that bad. They dont want anyone sneaking into the pool. I also got ID'ed a few times at the casino and they are strict with not allowing any kids in there. Theres also shady canopies and umbrellas if ur not a big fan of the sun. there was no short supply of pool chairs. The beach was enjoyable and the hotel provided each guest with chairs brought to the location of your choice. The rooms were medium sized but cozy. At night in the lounge they have singers that sing different spanish music and some people get up and dance making a really nice atmosphere. the food in momoyama was awesome. the hot tub was open till 10pm for a nice late nite dip. There is a game room with a few decent games for the kiddies. The beach was amazing at sunset and at night. The water was warm and the sand was white  nice. Overall the stay was great and the food was good!The BadThe maids were not the best. The pool was beautiful - but FREEZING. everyone had trouble getting in it. I'm usually a big pool person but I couldn't bring myself to go in more than one time. The beach was warmer than the pool. The beach was nice, one of the nicest in the metro area but during christmas time the ocean cleans itself which means loads and loads of sea weed. The beach was covered with sea weed making it really hard to jump in. Once you got past a certain point it wasn't as bad but it was pretty gross. However, it does go away (the sea weed was completely gone on our last day). We asked the staff to recommend better beaches and we got a bunch of great beaches to visit. The one we went to was escambrones (its on the map given at the hotel). It was gorgeous and the water was clear  you could walk out 15 ft and still stand. I'd definitely reccomend it. The airport was also annoying and you heard every airplane that landed but you heard it practically everywhere on isla verde practically. The gift shop in the hotel was very overpriced  the tour desk was very sloppy. I reserved the biobay with castillo tours before I got there and when i confirmed they had no idea what I was talking about. I'd recommend going through Nestor at the concierge. Also the biobay tour we went on was in the van of some guy named Ishmael and it was horrible. I think tours through actual companys are better but i dont know who or why castillo tours put us with this guy. Avoid Ishmael. Last but not least do NOT rely on cabs. The taxi situation is ridiculous there. Its 20 USD one way to go into old san juan. We had no car which made it difficult to go out at times. The better clubs and food was in old san juan but we couldnt enjoy it as much because it was so pricey to get there. There is a bus thats only 75 cents but it took really long and I didn't feel that comfortable. If you speak spanish and dont mind locals the bus might be a good solution. The area around the hotel isnt the greatest but I wouldn't call it seedy. Take the bus and your definition of seedy might change. im from a city so I felt fine walking along the street but I wouldnt stray too far from the hotel.FoodI thought the restaurants in the hotel were over priced so we went out searching for cheaper, local food. We ate a lot at Mi Casita in the shopping center across the street. They have good mofongos if ur into that. the food was good but the service was bad. We also ate at Metropol down the street. they had the best vanilla flan I have tasted in a long time. Once again the service wasnt great but food was very good. Across the street from Metropol is the isla verde mall that has a dennys if you want a cheap breakfast rather than the expensive breakfast in the hotel. There is a Walgreens if you walk in the san juan direction along with Burger King, Wendys, Churchs, Pizza Hut, Dominos, Subway  other little restaurants. In San Juan we loved Barra China. the service  food were great (their pina coladas were amazing). We ate at Ostra Cosa as well but we didnt enjoy it. If you are walking and you see a guy pushing a cart get some coco or another flavor. its only a dollar and they are very yummy. If you ask the hotel staff they will recommend good food for whatever you are looking for. There are definitely ways to eat good food for less if you are on a budget and know what you are doing. Overall for the price i thought Isla verde  the Intercontinental were great. its not a 5 star hotel but then again you arent really paying 5 star prices. if you want that pay a lot more and go to el san juan hotel. We had a great time and cant wait to go back! You will have an amazing time if you go knowing what you are in for. enjoy! Buen Viaje!

<Content>Perfect We stayed at the Intercontinental from Dec. 15-20. I can't understand the negative reviews. Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 10th floor overlooking the beach. It was a perfect location. Yes, there was only 1 chair on the balcony. If we wanted to, we could have taken a chair from the room outside. The room was nicely appointed. It didn't need to be spectacular since the weather was awesome and we were not in the room much. The concierges were most helpful.The buffet was included in our package. It was yummy. We went to the casinos at the El San Juan and the Ritz. We did notice a contrast in the lobbies of the 3. The Intercontinental was nondescript. The El San Juan looked like Havana in the 50's and the Ritz looked quite staid.Some people thought it was seedy walking around San Juan. If you are used to big cities, then you will feel at home. It didn't phase us at all. It was definitely safe. We like to try local food when we travel. We did not eat at any of the hotel chain restaurants. One meal was at The Metropol. It is across from The Ritz. It is Cuban food. It was excellent and not expensive. Someone on this site mentioned to order tres leche for dessert. Yes, it is a must. We also ate at Plato. It is between the El San Juan and The Ritz. We asked the waiter for advice and he told us the most popular dish. I don't remember the name. It was chicken stuffed with plantanos. The food was great, but, the service was quite slow. Our first night we didn't have a rental car and took a cab to a super fish restaurant called Atlantico. They had the best sangria. We ate at Spanglish in Old San Juan. It is good Puerto Rican home cooking. We drove to the Rain Forest. We hiked down to the waterfall at the bottom. It is about a 20-30 minute hike.The return trip is steep. Much to our disappointment, the sun was out. It was still beautiful. People said that Loquillo beach is a must. We went last year and decided to give it another shot on the way home from the rain forest. We don't understand what the hoopla is. It is just an ordinary beach. There are many kiosks selling local food that are supposed to be good. Last year we also went in December and went to a huge craft fair at the Barcardi Factory(I think it is always the 2nd week in December) It had a lot of local artisans and A LOT of people. It was worth the trip if you want to purchase locally made art. Old San Juan is colorful to walk around. There is a visitors center that has maps and info. Of course, there are many outlet stores, too.

<Content>Solid if not spectacular I stayed here with my wife and two children (12  15) Dec 25-31. I was a little concerned about what I would find based on some of the previous reviews, but overall ended up quite satisfied. We had an ocean side deluxe room (#710), which had a great view and was relatively quiet (didn't hear our neighbors plus we made sure to get a room away from the elevators). In terms of the room, this is NOT a 5-star hotel - it's a solid 3.5 in my book, but I came in with this expectation and was not disappointed. Beds were fine, basic amenities fine, bathroom small but functional. If you're looking for a 4 or 5-star type experience, you'd have to look elsewhere (Ritz or El San Juan?). Otherwise, the pool area is really nice, the lobby is good, and the staff are friendly and helpful.We've gone to Florida the last 3 Christmases and got fed up with the spotty weather. So we decided to pay the extra price for better weather and were glad we did. Otherwise, in terms of room, beach and pool, this is not much different from the place we last stayed at in Boca Raton (I can't remember the name!) and the clientele is very similar. The beach is nice but not spectacular, but perhaps I'm a bit of a beach snob, having been to some of the best in the Carribean. For GREAT beaches in Puerto Rico, you have to take a short boat trip to one of the islands (Icacos or Culebra) off the East coast. In fact, I would highly recommend the East Wind catamaran sailing  snorkeling trip, although there aren't many comfortable or shaded seats on board, so be prepared to rough it a little and bring lots of sun protection.I grew up in cities and some rough areas, so had no problems wandering around at night, but the fact of the matter is that - outside the nice resorts - the Isla Verda area (and greater San Juan as far as I could tell) is very run-down and seedy. I knew this coming in and it didn't bother me, but for those of you who like to wander around discovering charming little shops and restaurants, you'll be disappointed! Perhaps Old San Juan is better for this, but my wife came away unimpressed from her half-day trip there (I didn't go).I would consider going back because: 1) the trip in and out is so easy, 2) the hotel, pool  beach are pretty nice, 3) the weather is better than Florida, and 4) some great beaches and snorkeling are an easy day-trip away.

<Content>Elegant and Relaxing Things I loved: pool, lobby, nice and attractive staff, beach, atmosphereThings I didn't like: Small gift shop, breakfastIf you are looking for a hotel that has a beautiful lobby, gorgeous pool(s) and breathtaking beach this is the hotel for you. This hotel was a breath of fresh air for my friend and I. There were no screaming children, the staff was very attentive, and the overall atmosphere was laid back. I really liked that there wasn't pool games going on where the pool staff yells at you to participate. The room was nice and accomodating no complaints. Though we did complain a few times about the TV not working. The location wasn't bad. There was a gorcery store down the street, along with a Subway and a few other American fast food places. I wasn't too thrilled with breakfast at the hotel. There was only one restaurant that served it and it wasn't too good.Can't comment of Casino. I don't gamble.

<Content>Nice staff, bad room We stayed at the Inter-Continental San Juan Resort for two nights in mid-December 2005.The hotel is located right on the beach (public beach) in Isla Verde near the airport. The gardens at the front and back of the hotel were very nice. The main lobby was also quite nice, with live music in the evenings. Swimming pool in the back is large. The staff was superb, from the front desk to the hotel security to the tour coordinator. Friendly, polite, and efficient.The rooms however are really showing their age and require renovations (someone posted in their review that the hotel was recently renovated... I think that only meant the main lobby... or perhaps renovation has yet to be carried out for the floor we stayed on !?). Sound insulation was very poor. Walking in the hallway, I can hear kids talking in the rooms. When in our room at night, I can clearly hear the TV in the next room. The airplanes were also very loud, but that's what you get for staying close to the airport. We also found two small cockroaches in our room... There aren't a lot to see around the hotel, although there are a few restaurants and a supermarket across the street.If we paid the hotel advertised $200US/night rate, I would've been quite disappointed with our stay. However we got a deal at $100 US/night which made the stay more worthwhile.

<Content>Great Stay! The Intercontinental was a great place to stay in San Juan! Staff was very helpful and friendly! Rooms were nice and had balconies (unlike some other hotels in San Juan). It was close to the airport but not too close. Finally, the hotel is located on a gorgeous stretch of beach. I would highly recommend this hotel. For restaurants, Ruth Chris Steakhouse was wonderful as was the Italian restaurant Piccola next door at the Wyndham El San Juan.

<Content>ice cold pool I just spent about three nights here 12-7 to 12-10 and found the staff very attentive with one exception. while at the pool area i was never approached by any of the waitress' to see whether i wanted something to drink. at one point a lady next to me was asked if she wanted something from the bar and the waitress did not even look my way. other than the pool waitress' everyone else was great especially the valet parking staff. i would highly recommend this hotel. room was clean and neat.

<Content>Liked it and will probably be back... Traveled here for a week with our 2 year old. We would recommend this resort, with a couple of minor issues.Plusses: This is by far the easiest destination in the Caribbean for travel. Non-stop flight, no customs hassles, hotel 10 minutes from airport. Within an hour of the plane landing we were hanging at the pool. For this reason we will be back again next time.Nice room-- pay up for the ocean view its worth it. Somehow we got booked on the top floor in what seemed to be an upgraded suite. We were glad to have the included breakfast package since there was a variety of good food (especially the omelette  waffle station)  they didn't charge us for our kid's food. The pool and beach are both very nice. Our child loved playing with the other toddlers in the wading area. The surrounding bars and restaurants were convenient when out in the sun. The ocean water was really warm and the waves weren't too huge. If you like to snorkle I'd recommend Caymans or Cozumel instead.The staff was very attentive. I liked having the fast food restaurants nearby...though the few hundred dollars they saved us was spent in the casino. Also contrary to some of the other reviews we found the area around the main street in front of the hotel to be fine, even at night. We live in the city  I'm far more concerned about walking around at night at home!Minuses:Room had thin walls so a few nights we were kept up by loud neighbors TVs and conversations. I'm sure they had the same complaint about our loud child early in the morning. My usual trick, turning up the fan on the thermostat to drown out noise, only works for like 10 minutes then the fan turns off. The pool is not heated and was too cold for our child to go swimming, though it seemed fine for the older kids.El San Juan casino next door was nicer  seemed to have better payouts.All in all we'd come back but I think we'll try the Ritz next time (which seems awful close to the airport...)

<Content>Good and Bad I stayed with family from NYC from Nov 24th to Dec 2nd. I had read quite few reviews on the property, so I was a lttle bit unsure of what I was going into. The hotel staff, especially Juan from Avis Rent a Car and Nestor the Concierge could not have been more helpful. The overall staff were pleasant and helpful. Most times when leaving and entering the hotel, someone was always quick to hold the door open for you. The pool, beach and ocean were just delightful. There were plenty of chairs and the kids just loved the waterfalls in the pool area. Food in the hotel was OK, if you go for the breakfast package prepaid be sure that you are a big eater in order to get true value. The food at the buffet was fair at best, but you can only do so much with eggs, bagels and cereal. Ruth Chris and the resteraunts in the ESJ were outstanding.Go for the upgrade to the ocean view rooms (10th floor or higher, worth the extra $) Just a spectacular view. Mini fridge in room so stock up at one of the local stores within walking distance (day time hours only) Unsafe at night.When people talk about the surrounding area/streets as being seedy/dumpy they are right on the money. What a shame to have such beautiful beachfront hotels surrounded by such unsavory characters and trash. Let's get Trump or Wynn down here and do it right. The hotels advertise casino gaming. I guess if you've never seen Vegas or AC these pocket casino's might work. The slot machines did not pay at all in the whole time I was there, not that I was looking to hit it big, but at least give you a little tickle once in a while. If your looking to get a free drink when your on the slots, think again, because it just does not happen. I spent about $500 over a few nights on the slots, and was never offered a drink. Another reason to bring in the Donald. Side trips to Old San Juan, Rain Forest and the Caves are a must if you have the time. Don't be fooled into going over to Ponce, nothing there to speak of. Overall if you can get by the crazy drivers, seedy main drag, poverty in most area's and poor excuse for a casino and just enjoy the hotel, sun, pool and beach for what they are (very nice), you will not be sorry for staying at the Intercontinental, the folks seem to try hard at the hotel and are sincere in doing the best they can, but Puerto Rico is what it is. If you want true 4 or 5 style luxury and surroundings go to another Island.

<Content>NOT a 5 Star Hotel Just returned from the Intercontinental Hotel in San Juan. I chose this hotel partly because of the reviews on this site. Unfortuneatly, my experience at the hotel was not a very good one. My biggest problem with the property was that it is rated 5 stars, and is no way even close. I would rate it 3 stars, at best. When you book a 5 star hotel you have certain expectations. None of my expectations were met.First of all, the Intercontinental is the old Sands Hotel. In places it looks just as dated as the Sands. The rooms have been renovated and were relatively clean but not like other Intercontinental Hotels, they have no style or warmth. We had booked a Jr. Suite. When we arrived we found out at the front desk that all Jr. Suites only face the city,(which really was not a problem) and all of them are located between the elevators. It was nosy all the time, but not unbearble. The room was not at all decorated, it had the necessaities but nothing else. Housekeepping was horrible. Everyday they never left toiletries, so no matter what time we got back to our room we had to call for toiletries. After 6 days, that gets old. They never made the king size bed, they put the bedspread on top of the TV and left it there. When we checked into the room there were no bathrobes, the toliet paper holder was off the wall, so the tissue sat on the floor and the hair blower was broken. I realize this may not seem like a big deal but when you want the service of a 5 star hotel, and pay for it, it is really dissappointing when you do not receive it. Management is a joke. When I went to check out my bill indicated that I had not paid anything and that was incorrect because I had pre-paid. In addition, the nightly rate was 40.00 more per night that I was quotad and paid for. When I questioned the front desk, they told me the 40.00 extra per night was for the third person in my room. I had no idea there was a fee, my reservation was always for three people and they never mentioned it. Plus no one ever did anything for the third person. My husband and I had to make up the sofa bed every night ourselves. As far as the prepayment, he told me according to him there was no prepayment. When I asked him to try and look deeper into the reservation he told me to call my credit card company and check my charges. By the way none of his responses were given in a pleasant way. At this point I wanted to speak to the manager.I called and received someone at the front desk who claimed he was the front desk manager.I wanted the hotel manager. I was told there was no hotel manager on staff this particular night. I know that was a lie because while I was waiting for the elevator approx. 20 minutes prior, I saw the hotel manager with another guest who was furious. I will not go into that problem because I did not witness it. Anyway, I knew the hotel manager was somewhere in the hotel but I decided to respect what this person told me and proceeded to tell him the problems with my bill. He tells me that he needs to look at all the records and he will call me back.....I am still waiting to hear from him and I have been home two days already. In fairness to the hotel, the food was very good, the grounds are well kept and very pretty, and they have a good beach. Service was good and the staff, (most of them) were friendly. The only problem was that they were always nice and pleasant, they just didn't always do what you asked for. I have been to San Juan many times and I think if you really want the service of a 5 star hotel maybe you should consider the Ritz Carlton. I have not stayed there so I cannot say so for certain. However, I can say the Intercontinental is NO way a 5 Star Hotel in San Juan.

<Content>Fabulous!!!!!! My husband and I decided to go there to celebrate our anniversary. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted like royalty. The concierge upgraded our room to an ocean view upon learning of the reason for our trip. He was extremely kind and friendly. Our room was nice and clean, and the view was georgeous. Complimentary beaches chairs, towels and tables were provided for us to layout on the beach. Bar service was provided at the beach, which was a nice addition.The food and the pool bar was excellent as well as the staff, who did their upmost to make our stay memorable. The lobby, pool area and surrounding areas was very nice and clean. The casino was nice as well. At night the lobby was a nice play to just take it down, enjoy a drink and music. The location was great in that you were able to walk around and eat and drink at the local spots. A huge 24 hr Walgreens Pharmacy was located down the street, which was nice if you needed any toiletries etc.I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to come to Puerto Rico.

<Content>I didn't love it .... My husband and I chose the IC San Juan for a three night stay as part of the honeymoon. I have to start this review off with a brief moan about first impressions of Puerto Rico. We had quite a bit of luggage due to our wedding and being on holiday for nearly four weeks. At the airport we paid for a luggage cart (surely all airports should provide this as a matter of courtesy?!?) only to find out that we were only allowed to wheel it to the other side of security and not outside to ground transportation - fat lot of help the luggage cart turned out to be. Airport staff were also really miserable (with the exception of the slightly mad immigration officer!). Anyway moan over ... my first impressions of the IC weren't overly positive. Whilst the staff were very welcoming and friendly I felt the room was a little small (King Bed Ocean View) and the view of the ocean can only be described as laughable given that the predominant view was of the roof of the restaurant below!!!! Other reviewers are spot on when they say that the balcony is very small - ours had a small table and one chair - not ideal for honeymooners wanting to share a romantic moment! The room was smaller than other hotels we've stayed in although I did like the separate dressing table area just outside the bathroom. Bathroom light fittings were damaged and the bathroom was very small. On the plus side the bed was very comfortable! We set off to explore the rest of the hotel. The pool is nice (the water is cold!) and there are plenty of sun loungers with very comfy cushions. The only negative thing about the pool area, in my opinion, is that it gets quite shady early on in the afternoon so not good for sunbathing. We had lunch at the restaurant at the cafe at the back - standard fare (pizza and burgers) but tasty with good service. The beach is nice and IC guests also have use of sun loungers. Ocean is warmer than the pool but beware my husband was stung by a jelly fish! The staff at the hotel were able to offer assistance with this to ease the stinging!!!We used valet parking whilst we were there and the car was always available when we got outside - valets were friendly and helpful. We ate at Ruth Chris Steakhouse (twice) - delicious!We also visited Old San Juan - there's parking right at the top by El Morro in an underground lot (v.convenient) and the Barcardi Factory. I agree with a previous review that you don't actually learn much about the process of rum making and the guided tours are herded through quite quickly not giving enough time to listen (it's an audio tour) to all the information. My husband enjoyed it as he had his two free drinks as well as mine!!!One evening we wandered over to El San Juan - hotel was busy and there seemed to be a good atmosphere. Not sure I would pay the price to stay here when it's only a five minute stroll from the IC and you can still enjoy all it has to offer.All in all I'm not sure I would hurry back to Puerto Rico even though I did enjoy my stay.

<Content>Great service and prime location My husband and I (ages 34 and 32) just returned from a 5 night stay at the InterContinental. We鈥檝e been on many tropical vacations before (Mexico, Aruba, Jamaica, St. Marten). Our trip to P.R. was a last-minute decision. We were looking to travel to a beach destination during the Thanksgiving week that was a short flight from the N.Y. area airports. We wanted a location that had a beach, nightlife  an area we could explore independently.SUMMARY: Overall we were satisfied with our stay at the IC and I would rate it 3 out of 5 stars. ROOM: We booked and received a city-view room with a king size bed. The room was clean and functional, albeit smaller than I thought for the price and the carpet slightly worn.SERVICE: This is where the IC shines. Every employee we encountered was super friendly, attentive  eager to help.CONCIERGE and FRONT DESK: While friendly, I must note that some of the advice/suggestions given by the concierges were off the mark. For example: 2 of them recommended a trendy restaurant in Old San Juan, AquaViva. We asked for an upscale seafood restaurant. Well AquaViva is really a 2-star restaurant charging 5-star prices in my opinion. We found it to be overpriced, overhyped and overcooked (my dinner that is). The total bill was over $120 for 2, which included 2 drinks, appetizers  dinner for 2 people. Add on about $40 for the cab ride from the hotel and back, and we spent over $140. We don鈥檛 mind spending the $$ but when the place looks like a diner painted blue with seashells as the d茅cor and we arrive dressed to impress it was disappointing, especially since the food was overcooked and the bill was about the same as we spent at some much higher-end restaurants we dined at during our stay. We did enjoy La Piccola at the El San Juan  Ruth's Chris steakhouse. We chalked it up as a 鈥淟ost in Translation鈥?episode. What we consider upscale may differ from others since we eat out regularly at some great New York City restaurants. For those looking for restaurant suggestions in Old San Juan, I highly recommend simply taking a cab to Fortaleza street (restaurant row) and walking around yourselves and deciding. We saw more appealings choices when we went on our own strolling through Old San Juan.Also, on a number of occasions, we had difficulty speaking with the concierge or someone at the front desk. Either there was no one manned at the desk for extended periods of time, or a few times when I called the concierge desk no one answered the phone. This wasn鈥檛 anything to ruin our trip, but these are issues that keep the IC firmly as a 3-star hotel in my opinion.POOL/BEACH area: Everything was well maintained. Food and service at the restaurants near the pool and beach were great. Also, the hotel does provide free towels  beach chairs. You simply go to the pool hut and provide your room number.ACTIVITIES: We rented a car for a day with AVIS and went to Old San Juan and we also hopped on the ferry to go to the Bacardi Factory. The ferry to the Bacardi Factory was only 50 cents pp and then a quick shuttle ride to the Bacardi Factory. Personally, I would just skip the factory visit, it鈥檚 more like a looong Bacardi commercial. They don鈥檛 really go into depth with the process of rum making. We were just glad that we didn鈥檛 pay the tour package price to go there!!We also visited the bio-bay arranged right at the hotel for $150. This was a surreal experience. Make sure you wear your bathing suit and don鈥檛 wear anything that you don鈥檛 want to get wet. You鈥檙e basically paddling your way in water in a kayak at 10 pm in pitch black so be prepared. It鈥檚 not for the faint of heart or for small children in my opinion. THANKSGIVING: The hotel had a special Thanksgiving buffet for about $35pp which included mimosas and dessert. Given the price, we thought it was a good value and the turkey was delicious. We noticed the resort had a lot more guests check in the day before Thanksgiving and we were glad we were leaving the next day to avoid the crowds.Would we go back? Possibly, but I鈥檇 be more likely to consider the El San Juan next door if I find out that they鈥檝e updated their hotel rooms more. El San Juan had a lot more ambience and was a lot livelier at night. I鈥檇 certainly recommend the IC for families or groups looking for a decent place to stay in San Juan.

<Content>Good Deal for a Quick Getaway Stayed at Intercontinental 11/13-11/17/2005 and enjoyed our stay. Arrived at 2pm but room not ready..was able to check in by 3pm. Check in is listed at 4pm. Had a city view room, asked for an upgrade but was denied because Hotel was booked. Asked next day, advised room avail if we wanted to pay $40 extra per day. Worth the money for an ocean view/city view not the most appealing. Very close to airport can see  hear planes from hotel room/Some buildings in the city look very run down. There were some really nice rooms that had patios that were steps from the pool and beach. If I ever stay again I would book that. Taxi from airport $9 going to hotel but $11 from hotel which we found strange!!! Quick easy access to  from airport which is a plus for those on a short trip. I was very concerned about the weather since the weather reports showed rain with a dark cloud every day. It was rainy and overcast the entire 1st day so we spent the night enjoying the casino (just played nickel slots which were alot of fun but not very loose)def not VEGAS...lol/won  lost, basically broke even but had lots of fun. Got free drinks at the casino while playing but had to look for a waitress since we were only playing nickels..lol. My husband does not play the slots but was happy watching the game on a HUGE TV located in the casino. We did eat at the Japanese Steak House inside the hotel which was alot of fun , got to meet some other people at our table. Price ok approx $50 for the two of us. Prayed that night for sun and the next three days were sunny (YIPEE!!)..did have periods of quick showers. Jumped in the Jacuzzi during brief showers, nice  hot/bubbly or lounged in nice padded chair under tent or umbrella because rain usually didn't last long. It does get overcast at times so be sure to use sunblock as you can burn very fast . Beach was nice...golden sand not white but was raked every morning. Look closly when walking on beach to observe little clams being washed ashore/little lizards running around grounds of hotel. If you order a drink from the beach it has a surcharge...paid $9+tip for a mudslide from Splash Bar but it was VERY GOOD. Snorkeling/Fishing and other tours can be booked at pool hut. Plenty of clean towels and free bottled water. Snorkeling canceled due to rough water. Had alot of wind. Spent 2 lazy days on beach and at pool. Took local bus A-5 to Old San Juan .25 cents/nice shopsnote: Bus gets very crowded had to stand up during 1/2 the trip on the way back (apprx 50-60 min ride to Old San Juan on bus) If you dont like crowds can take taxi for approx $16 each way(see Conciere before going to San Juan for good info/map) Took ferry (.50 cent pp)from Old San Juan from Pier 2 and then taxi ($3 pp) to take free tour of Bacardi Factory which included 2 free drinks per person. Good deals there on all kinds of Rum. Oh...the breakfast at hotel is expensive unless included in hotel price...we enjoyed Mi Casita restaurant for breakfast. A short walk to the right of the hotel/a very small place but had great coffee. Area also has grocery/liquor store..dominos pizza, ponderosa, burger king. Another shopping area w/a Dennys to the left of the hotel. Overall, Hotel staff was nice...best service was at the beach where staff will place beach chair for you. Security always on duty..felt very safe. One last thing...rooms were small and the balcony is for one person only. Rooms were clean/did not see any bugs or anything like that. If you prefer a more polished luxury hotel with alot of night life then you may want to stay next door at the Wyndam. Intercontinental is an overall good deal for the money. BEST FEATURE: POOL/BEACH

<Content>Great Vacation  My vacation was from Nov 9-15. Note that this review is from a 25 year old (female) and traveled with my friend- same age. I was overall very happy with this hotel. The hotel is a five minute drive from the airport, which was great. This also means you will hear the planes -this did not bother us. We had arrived early, about 2 hrs prior to check in time, but we were given our room right away, no waiting, which was great. The room was nice, we had a city view- this was not a big deal as i didnt plan to spend my vacation in my room. My first impression was that all the staff were extremely helpful and very nice. The beach was clean, warm water- not crystal clear as compared to other islands, but still very nice. The pool was nice although we mostly stayed at the beach. The food / drinks at the hotel were a bit pricey( although good). Head across the street where you can pick up drinks/snacks at the supermarket, and there are plenty of american chains for a cheap breakfast/lunch. Also, Mi Casita is very reasonable although plan to wait for a while- service was a bit slow but food was still good. For dinner we mostly ate away from the hotel because we wanted to try as many local restaurants as possible. I highly recommend Ajili Mojili ( sp?) Food was excellent- definetly the best that I had while in PR. As far as nightlife at the hotel, there is a small bar in the lobby ( nice spot to get a drink and hang out- low key) and there is a casino. The casino in the hotel was ok for my purposes, Im not a big gambler so I really cant comment. Nightclubs- We went to Babylon - at the El san juan ( their lobby on the weekend was packed - in comparison to IC). We also went to senor frogs,Pool Palace and Lazer- there are alot of clubs  bars in the area- depending on what kind of music you like. Concierge  staff in the hotel were helpful in giving us some ideas. As far as the weather, prior to leaving I checked the forecast which said rain every day, I was a little worried, but if it rained, it was for about 10 minutes then it cleared up. We did not lose any days due to the rain. I would definetly recommend taking the tour to El Yunque ( bring an umbrella), tour was great, rainforest  waterfalls were beautiful. Old San Juan has alot of great shopping and plenty of restaurants. You can take the bus for .25 ( but the last bus out of Old San Juan was 9pm- so we always took a taxi). Overall we had a great time in PR and at the Intercontinental. I would definetly recommend this hotel and would return for another stay.

<Content>Great Value! My husband and I stayed at the Intercontinental in San Juan for a weekend getaway in mid-September. We paid about $120 per night and was impressed with the hotel, staff, and service. The room faced the street and was not very large, but we didn't stay in the room much so it didn't matter. The meal at Ruth's Chris was delicious, the pool was beautiful, and although my French Toast from Room Service was not hot, it was very good. The only problem arose when workmen began repairing something, somewhere, banging on whatever they were fixing, at 7:30am. I called the front desk and the banging stopped with 5 minutes of the call (and five minutes is probably much longer than it really took). I was promptly brought pillows when I requested them and the concierge was very helpful when advising us of activities during our very short stay, including taking into account that I was 6 months pregnant and couldn't participate in certain activities. The hotel was perfect - close to the beach, airport, and a not-so-short bus ride through a rough part of San Juan to Old San Juan. That didn't bother me much - I'm from Chicago - however, others might want to bypass the bus and go with a cab, especially at night. Oh, and I won $100 from a $1.00 bet at the slots in the casino, which featured a non-smoking section that was kept that way by security guards. We will definitely return to the Intercontinental San Juan.

<Content>Nice hotel.... Good value We stayed from 10/26/05 to 10/29/05 at $180/night for cityview room. We inquired about an upgrade to oceanview room, and they were able to accomodate us, which was really appreciated because the hotel faces a busy street. The area in front of the hotel is somewhat rundown. The room was nice, but pretty small. The pool area was nice, water is complimentary where you get the towels. The beach was a little disappointing as their are rundown highrise buildings are in view. However, the water was warm and there were no rocks in the sand. We ate at the metropol one night, food was good and very reasonable. Also, ate at overpriced Ruth's Chris and had mediocor food, and not too much atmosphere. We also ate at the Wyndham El San Juan at the La Piccola Fontana, which was more reasonable than Ruth's Chris and very good. Would also recommend Denny's down the street for breakfast as we paid $45 for breakfast for two one day in the hotel.The Wyndham El San Juan seems to have more nightlife than this hotel and a bigger casino. Overall, I think the resort is a good value especially if you are interested in gambling and nightlife.

<Content>Great Hotel! Beautiful rooms and outstanding pool area, great restaurants, exceptional service provided by a very friendly staff, extremely clean. Lobby is adequate, but small. Casino is small but the staff is very pleasant. Little night life, but you can go next door to the El San Juan. I was quite surprised by this hotel. Good value for the dollar, from rooms to facilities to food  beverages to health club to the beach. Being a frequent traveler to San Juan, and having stayed at all of the major hotels, the Intercontinental is the nicest overall beach front hotel in San Juan. Can't go wrong staying here.

<Content>Saved by the Club I travel a lot for my job and needed to get away for a nice quiet vacation with my husband. Booked a quick trip after reading some reviews to the IC in San Juan. When we got there the San Juan area had a huge DC Summit convention arrive that took over most of the hotel Zone. It was a zoo. People everywhere. I was horrified by the all night partying, drug smoking in their rooms, half naked people (in the lobby's) and Sex on the beach (literally not the drink). We had upgraded to an oceanview room which was fantastic but then due to the crowd couldn't sleep so the hotel went out of there way to accomodate us, treated us to a romantic dinner and moved us to the club level due to my loyatly over the years to them. They were really fantastic to us and saved our trip from a nightmare to a memorable trip. My negatvie is San Juan isn't the nicest of areas to visit. A bit dirty and not a lot of extra things to do other than go to Old San Juan.

<Content>Loved IC In Puerto Rico My husband and I just returned from the InterContinental in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico, in the San Juan area 9/18-9/24. This hotel was a wonderful experience and met all my expectations and more. I used the reviews on the tripadvisor website as a guide when I booked this trip and I'm happy I picked this hotel. The hotel was perfect!!!!!!!! The hotel grounds are in excellent condition. The beach on this strip is public, but the hotel security insures nobody from the outside gains access to the IC pool or hotel. It was never to crowded, the food was delicious and the service very friendly...ate in all of them (Ruth Chris, Momoyama (japense rest.), the Italina one (can't remember its name) and ordered food from the pool area. Everything was good. The drinks were also yummy and the swim up bar was a treat. The concierge was pleasant. And they have live entertainment at the bar and the casino. I recommend a room with a view of the city. Ocean view is nice, but San Juan is beautiful at night. Having family from PR I've never experienced the island as a tourist. And staying at the InterContinental was all the worthwhile. I have no complaints about this stay. FYI they also have a gym and Spa onsite. My husband and I highly recommend staying at InterContinental. Especially if your traveling with your honey or the family. A must if you visit PR is El Morro, El Yunque Rainforest, Old San Juan, and Paseo la Princessa - beautiful at night. Who am I kidding there is so much to see a week just wasn't enough.

<Content>Loved It! This Hotel is better than what the reviews indicate!! The people were so nice. The room was spectacular. Make sure you upgrade to an ocean-view, it's cheap and well worth it($40). The pool was the best I've ever seen in many years of traveling. The casino was lots of fun, we played craps for several hours and received free drinks and even sandwiches. All the people at this hotel were extremely friendly and will go out of their way to help you with anything needed. You will not regret staying here!!

<Content>EXCELLENT The Intercontinental was great. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean, the beach and the pool were very nice everything was wonderful. I would definately reccomend this place if you want to stay somewhere nice and have great service while you're in San Juan. I saw the review that said you have to pay for the pool and beach that is not true at all I didn't pay one single penny for the pool or the beach it was all free access to anyone staying at the hotel This hotel is wonderful I am definately going back to intercontinental next time I visit San Juan

<Content>Great hotel got a great deal on priceline.. the room is very nice,. the pool is amazing. bars and restaurant really nice. the staff is goodthe only problem is the 12 USD parking fee for self parkingThe beach is nice itself but the sea is not the kind of sea you expect in PR. Other beaches offer much nicer sea and sand.

<Content>Lovely hotel...neighborhood so-so The rooms are well kept and neat. Lobby has a nice lounge area with live music in the evenings. The casino is ok...not very large but has most the table games. On a Friday night we were able to get a $10 minimum blackjack table. The pool area is large with an ample supply of cushioned lounge chairs. Although we were there off-season; it may get compeptitive for pool-side seating during peak times. Severs were always visible for poolside drinks or food. You have to wear a bracelet pool-side to show you were a guest and not a mooch, and we were asked several times to show our bracelets (we slipped them off to avoid tan-lines). The extra security was actually kind of nice since the neighboring area was a bit sketchy.The beach is huge, gorgeous, and with flat-sand with plenty of room for many without feeling like you are on top of another group. Hotel guests get lounge chairs and umbrellas (although they did run out of umbrellas later in the day). Water was calm with small waves, very kid-friendly.We never ate dinner in the hotel, but we had lunch at both outdoor cafes (slightly different menus). We noticed that although prices were similar, the pool bar seemed to give larger portions on their meals than the beachfront cafe did (i.e. more fries).One downer - you aren't allowed to bring takeout food to pool area. You can only eat outside food in your rooms or on the beach (beaches are public). Kind of a pain.Like I said, neighboring area is a bit sketchy. There is a supermarket across the street, and some decent takeout choices (if you want to save some $$). We walked to a local place called Lupi's for dinner one night (you hang a left outside the hotel entrance and it's 5-7 minute walk). Good mexican food and drinks..Friday night had karoake, at that point it was full of locals, but the crowd was friendly and cheered for us when we got up to sing (note that margaritas were tasty and STRONG, hence our embarrasing karoake performance). note - there is also a Lupi's in Old San Juan, this one is same owner/chain.We never wandered more than a few blocks in either direction from the hotel, and being an all female group, we never walked alone. We got Pizza Hut one night, Lupi's another and subway for lunch so it's not like we were scared to go out. The area isn't a slum or anything, but it's not exactly the type of neighborhood where you go wandering at night to find a resturant or bars.We ate one night in Old San Juan...had the BEST sangria and cheap Mexican and PR food. I am waiting for credit card bill to verify name and will try to post that. Had an indoor a/c section with front bar (fairly narrow area) and also a larger outdoor but covered patio area. Sangrias served in brown earthenware pitchers and made fresh when ordered! It is close to the square and only 2-3 blocks from the water (the street it is on runs parrallel to the water). Peek at menus and glance in the doors of resturants and you'll find it, has mexican and PR cuisine, and most entrees are under $15 (looking in - the bar is close to the door on the left, tables along the wall to the right and in the rear)...a very casual place. If you are heading towards the square, it's on the left side of the street. Nice portions and great sangria.

<Content>AWESOME HOTEL!!! This is a fabulous hotel. My second time in Puerto Rico, stayed at the San Juan Sheraton the first time and hated it there. THe intercontinental had awesome service. We asked to be upgraded but they were unable to do so. The staff was extremely courteous - our luggage was sent upstairs, we didn't have to worry about dragging it to the elevator. The rooms were nice, had a safe, mini fridge, every room has a balcony. A pool view or ocean view room would have been nice, but even the front of the hotel is pretty nice, has a waterfall. Complaints - bathroom is pretty small, shower is really small, i didn't care for it. the bathroom was pretty though and there is a vanity outside the bathroom. Room service wasn't that great, the cleaning lady didn't even bother changing our glasses.This was a very convenient hotel to stay at considering the beach was right outside the hotel and the pool area was just gorgeous. the mediterranean restaurant around the pool area is a bit pricy, the drinks are at least. you are better off buying a drink elsewhere and going to the pool area. Beach is absolutely beautiful, whtie sand, blue skies and clear blue water - what more can you ask for? This hotel is paradise, and i got a great deal on it, perhaps why i wasn't upgraded. The casino and lounge area aren't that great in the hotel. There is a spa though and a salon.

<Content>Great Hotel. Great Location. Great Vacation. I took my wife to San Juan for her 40th birthday(Aug. 12 - Aug.16). Our travel agent recommended the IC  she was absolutely right in saying it was a great hotel. It is only a 5-8 minute taxi ride to the IC from the airport. Upon checking in, we were offered an upgrade from a city view to a beautiful ocean view. Check-in was a breeze and our person (Orlando) checking us in made it very simple for first time visitors to the hotel property. Room was clean  very nice. We ate most of our meals within walking distance from the IC. You can find all of the American food chains within a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Old San Juan is a must for those who visit Puerto Rico(my wife is still raving about the affordable shopping). Even though the casino is smaller than the ones I am used to visiting in Vegas, it is still a lot of fun--the dealers are very nice  personable. One of the best things the IC offered was $5.00 Blackjack with very liberal rules(doubling on any 2 cards, doubling after splitting, etc.)--try finding that in Vegas. For the price we paid on this trip, we came out way ahead(especially if we had stayed at one of the more expensive properties). In conclusion, if you have an upcoming trip to San Juan, I do not think you can go wrong with the IC. I think my wife will always remember the great time she had on her 40th.

<Content>Not a bad hotel... Since I relied on this site heavily when planning my trip to San Juan, I thought I would write a review to help out anyone else. We stayed there from August 10 to August 13. Hotel Room: We had a city view room with a king sized bed on a mid-level floor. The room was okay, the carpet had not been vacuumed - there were sunflower seeds on the floor from the last guest - gross. We had to call to fix the toilet in the bathroom 3 times - it wouldn't stop running all night  then would not flush at all. Unlike other posters here, we did NOT receive the complimentary fruit basket or wine from the hotel after our complaint. You can hear several planes flying by/over since the hotel is close to the airport - this did not bother me, but if you aren't used to it, the noise could keep you awake. Also make sure to check the mini bar when you get into the hotel room - they tried to charge us $3.00 for eating a bag of MM's from the mini-bar that wasn't even there when we checked in!! Otherwise, the maid service was fine after the first day - perhaps because I kept leaving her very good tips.Casino: Nothing like Las Vegas or Atlantic City. Very small with a limited number of machines - many of which were broken or out of service. Thankfully, we are not big gamblers or anything. The casino was virtually empty on Wednesday, but picked up substantially on Thursday and Friday nights. I did not see any waitresses coming around to take drink orders so I don't know if they exist or not. The casino at the El San Juan next door is nicer visually. Pool: The pool was very nice - you are allowed 2 towels at the pool check-in. The Splash! Bar was fun to swim up to  the pina coladas were excellent. A waitress came up to us in the late afternoon to take drink orders also. There were a lot of children playing in the pool throwing balls around, etc. If you don't want to get hit with the ball when you are under the umbrellas, avoid sitting anywhere near the pool. Food: We took the advice of other reviewers  tried the Metropol restaurant down the street - the food was good  reasonable - about $25 for two people for a late lunch. The supermarket across the street was a convenient place to get bottled water  sodas. We also ate at MiCasita for breakfast one morning - it was only $2.50 for the breakfast special of 2 eggs  potatoes  a breakfast meat! There is also a Pizza Hut restaurant down the street that was also good. Like most hotel restaurants, the ones here were WAY overpriced - the Momoyama restaurant was about $25 per person for plain old Chicken Teriyaki - I don't think so!! We ate at the breakfast buffet for $18 each - which was okay, but not the greatest. We also ate at the Palms Restaurant next door in the El San Juan hotel - the service was excellent - our server was Cynthia (she's wonderful) - the food was good and was one of the more reasonably priced hotel restaurants we looked at. Service: The valets are very nice  helpful - we used them to get taxis and directions around the area. We didn't use the concierge or any other services so I can't comment on that. The front desk was great by letting us have a late check out @ 1:00 PM - maybe that was to make up for us having to call about the broken toilet 3 times. Other: When going into Old San Juan, be sure to review the maps  directions that are in the magazines in your hotel room - the had the best directions of all the maps we had  will tell you were to go. It was hotter than the 4th circle of Hell when we were there - we both got heat stroke walking around Old San Juan. Make sure to drink a lot of water. Shopping: Make sure to visit the Coach Factory Outlet  the Ralph Lauren Factory Outlet in Old San Juan on Calle Christo- got some great deals on clothes  a few (early) Christmas presents.All in all, I would stay here again - the price was right, even with a few snafus, it's a nice hotel if you can't afford the Ritz-Carlton. Hope this helps someone else.

<Content>Been there 5 times - going back for more i'm new to tripadvisor, so i am posting some reviews of great experiences i've had. We've been to PR and stayed here at least 5 times -- bottom line, there is no better deal in PR than the InterContinental. First, staying in Isla Verde is literally 10 minute cab from the airport -- a huge deal when you are dealing with a quick trip. Second, the rates at the hotel are very reasonable, all classes of rooms. Third, it's right next door -- 2 minute walk -- to one of the best hotel lobbies in Carribeann, the El San Juan (now owned by Wyndham). it is the place to be on the island on weekend nights, with great bars and people watching and a casino i always describe as James Bond-esque. The big deal at the IC is staying in the Club Intercontinental. request a 1st floor room. it is adjacent to the pool system and you get you're own patio and chaise lounges and umbrella, etc. a great place to set up camp by just opening your sliding glass door. and the beach is a short walk from the pool. having easy access to my room is always a big deal for us on beach-type vacations. I can't handle an afternoon frying on the beach/pool. The rooms also have mini-fridges, and we always load up with drinks and snacks at the nearby grocery store when we arrive. Cuts down on that bill.You get a nice room, right next door to the El San Juan for half the price. one last tip -- go to Fortaleza street in Old San Juan for dinner. it's a $15 cab ride, but the old city is beautiful and there are 6 or 7 truly top-notch, non-national chain restaurants to choose from.

<Content>Fabulous hotel! I just got back this morning from a five day stay at the Intercontinental. I went with two friends for a last-minute weekend getaway, and we had an absolutely wonderful time there. We were upgraded to an ocean view room (all we did was ask for it) and had a gorgeous view of the pool and the ocean. The room was clean and had all the amenities that we needed. The pool was extremely refreshing, and the beach was private and clean with clear water and good security. My friends and I keep kosher, which means that we had to bring our food and couldn't eat at the restaurants, so I can't comment on that. The casino was small but fun, if you want a larger casino and/or a nightclub you can go next door to the Wyndham. We went to the Wyndham one night but enjoyed ourselves more at the casino in the Intercontinental. Having visited (but not stayed at) the Wyndham, I am extremely relieved that we went with the Intercontinental. The Wyndham feels more like a casino than a hotel, and the Intercontinental has too many qualities to stay anywhere else. The staff in general was wonderful - they were extremely nice, helpful, and cheerful. Nestor the concierge was terrific, he took care of everything we needed. All in all, we had a fabulous experience and would go back in a heartbeat. I have told all my friends that the Intercontinental is the way to go!

<Content>Great place for the money We just came back from Puerto Rico (June 27th), we stayed at the Intercontinental the day prior to leaving for a cruise and for one day after returning from the cruise. My husband and I are beach goers, but this hotel actually had us sunning by the pool. Service: The service by the pool was fantastic. Friendly staff and available each time we wanted to order.Pool: Pool was smaller than others we have seen in Mexico, but still very refreshing. The swim up bar provided a little shade and great service and drinks. Dancing and music provided great entertainment by the pool; however, the music was a bit loud, but did not play continuously. There were plenty of sunning chairs and shaded chairs by the pool absolutely no problem finding a chairBeach: The beaches in Puerto Rico are open to the public so it was a bit different than being in Mexico - pretty crowded on the second night. Still beautiful and clean. No huts to sit under like in Mexico, and chairs must be rented. I prefer some shade while my husband likes full sun so we stuck with the pool except for short swims in the ocean and a stroll. Bathrooms by the beach were clean. Room: The room was available for checkin early. Very clean. We had to have a safe installed the first day, and the wireless keyboard was jacked so we checked out at the desk. I'm pretty picky when it comes to the room and I felt it was nice and clean.Casino: My husband is the gambler and he said the casino was just ok. If I'm not mistaken it is collared shirts and slacks while gambling in the evening.Food: We did not dine at the hotel, there is a Ruth Chris steakhouse and a Japanese grill. I believe there is also an Italian restraunt. We were trying to conserve after being on the cruise, so we crossed the street to Subway where there is also KFC, Wendy's, Taco bell. We walked down the street one night and had dinner on the patio of a Mexican restraunt/bar. The food there was fantastic. We paid 170 each night, but I believe for the money we stayed at one of the nicer hotels there without exceeding $200 dollars. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>One of the better Isla Verde Resorts. We have stayed at the Intercontiental several 3 times over 3 different winters. Despite the Hotel being full almost every time we stayed there, it never felt uncomfortable. The rooms were always well furnished and cleaner than the average carribean hotel. Last time we stayed on the club area, which is a separate building on the right side of the pool. The club level was nice, but the club level is not catered towards travellers with children. The pool area is very nice, although I really wish they'd heat the pool. We've eaten at Momoyama (Japanese) which was good, Ruth's Chris which was surprisingly a hit with my 7 year old - (Very good meal). La Terraza and Ciao Mediteranean were good standbys. However, there are dozens of decent restaruants all within walking distance of this hotel.

<Content>A Solid Place to Stay My girlfriend and I traveled down to San Juan for Memorial Day weekend. Most everything you have read in previous reviews is true of the Intercontinental. Good pool, friendly service, and well maintained. I found the casino to be everything someone on a beach vacation would want. Yes it's small, but not cramped, and never too crowded. They have every casino game you would want/expect, plus four Texas Hold'em tables. But really, who's traveling down there to gamble? If you really feel the itch, the El San Juan does have a more serious casino. We were lucky enough to get upgraded upon arrival to a club level suite. Our room was wonderful. Clean, spacious, and with a view of the pool. The pool area had a very nice atmosphere that seemed to have a little of everything. You could lounge all day in a quiet spot, you could drink at the swim up bar and listen to the top 40 music, or you could join the younger crowd flirting in the pool. The beach is nice, but it seemed to become less pleasant as you strayed farther from the IC. If you have planned a stay at the IC, you have nothing to worry about. We found it to be clean, fun, and relaxing. Hope you enjoy yourselfs as much as we did.

<Content>Generally positive Nearly everything was very good at the Intercontinental. The pool is great, the staff is universally friendly and attentive and the overall property is well-maintained and clean. The casino is OK, but the ESJ casino next door is much better - better blackjack dealers, better drink service. My only complaint is that the place turned into a frat house on the weekends. Many rooms near us were filled with loud, drunk college kids. Fortunately, hotel security was responsive and quieted them on the multiple occasions that we complained about the noise.

<Content>Beautiful and comfortable Loved the Hotel Intercontinental. Upgraded our rooms when we checked in to a beautiful room 1st floor where you could walk out your patio and into pool area. Rained the whole time, only 2 days, but hotel had wonderful service and great gym too. Right on the beach! Had a wonderful time and they gave us great recommendations for dinner. Can't wait to go back to see it in the sun because it sure was awesome even in the rain.

<Content>No Complaints I was a little hesitant to stay here after reading some of the reviews. I am happy to report no negative feedback. We had a great stay, with an extremely helpful staff. Good security in the lobby as well as near the beach to ensure no pool crashers. The bathroom was starting to show it's age, but the rooms were large and came with ironing boards, mini bar, and safes.

<Content>A class act in San Juan After learning that the rooms in the Wyndham El San Juan were in the beginning stages of a badly-needed upgrade, (and after a scary experience at the Wyndhan Aruba), we booked a King, ocean-view superior (high floor) room at the Intercontinental. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a room in the Intercontinental Club suite -- close to the pool, free breakfast and happy hour with snacks and the club concierge. The room was large and extremely clean and pleasant, the bed was comfortable and the marble bathroom was a decent size. I agree with some of the other posts about the service in this hotel -- it was amazing. The casino was small and not worth spending much time in. The pool was beautiful, better than what I saw at the Wyndham; beach was nice as well. The beach was not as nice as Luquillo, but for Isa Verde, it was fine. The hotel seems to cater to business travelers, not too many children and not a big bar scene--both of which were fine for us. We went to Old San Juan and the Wynhdam next door at night. It was more of a nice, classy hotel rather than a beach resort. Overall, despite some rain, it was a great trip. I would stay there again if I chose Isla Verde.Happy Travels!

<Content>Very nice hotel and staff, on the beach We stayed at the Intercontinental May 13-15 for a weekend get-away. The staff are very nice, helpful, and really seem happy that you're there, genuinely polite. Hotel and the rooms are beautiful with a great view of either the city or the beach. The casino was nice. Very polite security personnel throughout the hotel and grounds. Taxis were readily available and resonably priced. However, we were disappointed with a couple of things. We didn't know that May is apparently the rainy season and it rained every day, and the Weather Channel predicted rain every day for the following week. Also, we were promised white sand and good snorkeling right off the beach. Nuh-uh. The sand was nice and soft, but the regular golden color, and you couldn't see anything while snorkeling. Not sure if this was because of there being so much rain lately, or if the waves kept everything churned up and murky. Also, the bathroom door was broken and didn't shut very easily, but we didn't complain about it (I just hope they don't think we broke it and charge our credit card!) The restaurants in the hotel are pricey, but there are plenty of fast food restaurants across the street from the hotel, plus a good restaurant with affordable local cuisine just down the street called the Metropol. Mainly because of the staff, we'd return to the Intercontinental.

<Content>Great Place! Rooms:My husband and I stayed here with friends in April and had a great time.Our room was immaculate and the bathroom fresh and clean. We had a beautiful ocean view with a small balcony. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. Service:The most striking thing about this hotel is the service. Everyone from housekeeping to management greets you with a smile. Nestor the concierge was wonderful. He even promised it would stop raining and it did! Beach:There was a huge storm hanging over the island when we arrived. Fortunately it blew out the next day. The storm did, however, churn up the water making it very murky and depositing a lot of seaweed on the beach. The IC was the ONLY hotel on the strip that had the beach raked clean the next day! The ocean was warm and calm. My only compaint for the entire stay is that there is a $10 charge for beach umbrellas that are not even in great shape. It seems at this level of hotel the umbrellas should be provided without an additional charge. Pool:After the storms the water was quite cool but did warm up in the next day or so. The pool is large and beautiful. There were plenty of chairs available even though the hotel was sold out. The pool service was outstanding and the pool bar was very good but a bit pricey ($9 per typical drink). Nightlife:They have a very nice, intimate lobby bar with a singer on most nights. A great place to start or end your evening. The guys liked the casino but none of us are big time gamblers. It was a bit too bright and cold for me. Definately the best place to be at night is next door at the Wyndham. Lots of local atmosphere and enertainment. Also check out the Waterclub down the street. The rooftop bar has a beautiful night view of Isla Verde. Its open air with a trendy atmosphere. The elevator ride alone is worth the 2 block walk. Food:The breakfast buffet at the IC is phenomenal. All the usual plus homemade waffles, bagels and lox, cheese blintzes and more. We purchased the breakfast built into our room rate which was the best way to go. We had lunch twice at the Ciao Mediterranean restaurant that is directly between the beach and pool area. Great place to enjoy the beach view and have lunch. La Piccola Fontana at the Wyndham was our best dinner there. Fine Northern Italian cuisine with excellent service. We also loved Dragonfly in Old San Juan. This is not for everyone though. Very dark atmosphere and funky menu. All dishes are served for the whole table and shared. My favorite was the Peking Duck Nachos. Overall we had a great experience and I would return to the InterContinetal again. San Juan is not a remote tropical get-away but a great place for having fun with lots of nightlife and activities. If you are reading this because you are planning a trip I am very jealous!

<Content>A Pleasant Surprise We stayed at the Intercontinental from April 29 through May 1. Had a great room with a small balcony overlooking the ocean. We were not expecting a first class hotel since we were there for a meeting but we really were pleasantly surprised by the great service, wonderful staff and beautiful facilities. It was well priced and really well maintained! Nestor, the concierge, made great dinner reservations for us at fabulous restaurants. We were very pleased with our stay.

<Content>Awesome Vacation First I want to make clear that this trip consisted of 8 girls aged 21-23. We were looking for sun, pretty beach, a nice pool scene and a good party!Weather was beautiful. Although its hot, its not US hot. There is a cool breeze from the ocean which makes the heat bearable.Beach was okay. I am from Jersey which means just about any beach is better than ours, but it wasn't fabulous. Noisy but good for laying out with friends.Pool at the IC was nice. We had no problem finding beach chairs at any time of the day. It was always clean. There was a swim up bar, but we never used it. The hot tub was nice, but can get a little to hot!!Party scene was awesome. We were right next door to Babylon in the El San Jaun Wyndham. Although we tried other places, we always ended up finishing off our nigths at the Babylon. NYC type club, but a far different crowd. Full of PR locals and well as tourist. We went to Senor Frogs one night too, it was an okay time, but on the empty side..The IC also has a little gym. By little, I mean very little! 3 treadmills and some weight machines. I went there about everyday, but only got to use the treadmill onces. It over looks the ocean, which is breathtaking, but only if you get a treadmill!Food was okay. We went to the mexican restuartant in the El San Juan Wyndham one night. It was good food at a reasonable cost. Other nights we just did the typical college diet which includes Burger king (which is across the street), Taco Bell, Pizza Hut etc. All within walking distance.We went to the rainforest as well. It is beautiful but not recommended after a night of extensive partying. The trip leaves pretty early and there is a lot of walking to do in the rainforest. Bacardi factory was a waste of time. Tour is very boring. Like going to a museum in 2nd grade. $6 for a bottle of Bacaradi there, but its $4 at the airport. Safe yourself the hassle. The rooms were good. Clean and served the purpose. Although the last night, our hallway carpeting was soaking wet. No idea why, but our rooms where fine. Best part of the room was that there was a fully lighted mirror outside the bathroom as well as inside. ( I know all you girls understand the need for that!)All in all, it was a great trip. Language barrier was not a problem. Most ppl speak english and our spanish wasn't bad. Counting the days to go back..

<Content>Average hotel My husband and I stayed at the Intercontinental April 26th-30th. I will start by listing the positives.-Very close to the airport. About a 5 minute taxi ride.-In walking distance to other places to eat if you don't want to spend $50 a meal at the hotel everytime just for breakfast. (Burger King, Grocery Store, MI Casita Restaurant which is very good for breakfast about $15 for 2 of us to eat.)-Beautiful beach. White powder sand. No rocks, or shells. Water was blue-green color and absolutely gorgeous. Very, very warm this time of year. The best part of the whole trip.-Excellent Italian restaurant in hotel. Expensive but probably the best meal we have had in a long time.Now the negatives.-Rooms are not what I expected. Carpet gross ( had to wear sandals at all times in the room. The overall apperance of the room needs updating. Probably the main reason I would not return to this hotel. There has to be better out there for your money. My husband and I are really picky but this needs improvement.-Bathrooms are also pretty gross. Shower has no water pressure. Fixtures in bathroom are all rusted and look terrible. -Casino is ok. But try the Wyndham El San Juan next door. There's is 10 times better and not nearly as smoky because it's much bigger.All in all this hotel was ok because of it's location. (10 min. $16 cab ride each way to Old San Juan. Does get expensive though) And, because of it's wonderful beach and pool area. If I was going to travel again to Puerto Rico I would stay at the Wyndham next door. MUCH nicer hotel. It's breath taking inside. The woodwork/ moldings are beautiful. MUCH more upper class than the Intercontinenal.Other San Juan tips: Don't go to Condado. What a dump. Nothing to see and under complete construction everywhere.And, skip the bacardi rum factory tour. What a waste of a day. Takes a few hours with travel time. Rum is cheaper there. But I would spend the extra money and enjoy the beach more and skip this one. Hope this helps!!

<Content>A Great Property! My husband and I stayed at the IC for one night preceeding and two nights following a cruise. The hotel is absolutely fantastic! We were able to upgrade to ocean view from city view rooms for a $40 upcharge each night. We definitely wanted to have the ocean view! We ate dinner one night at Metropol as we have on previous trips. The restaurant isn't much for atmosphere, but the food is good and inexpensive. Another night, we ate at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, located on hotel grounds. Excellent food! Our waiter, Alejandro, was great and gave us some excellent site-seeing tips! A traveler's tip: don't consume the items in the hotel mini-bar. It's very easy to simply walk across the street to the Isla Verde Fresh Food market and get all of the pop, beer, water, and snacks you could want. For example, hotel mini-bar charges $5 for a can of Medalla Light beer. A six-pack is $5.99 at the store! There's also a Walgreen's a few blocks to the west, in case you need a necessity or simply want photos developed. San Juan is a great place to vacation and the IC is excellent. If you're going on a Royal Caribbean cruise departing San Juan, go over to the Pan American terminal around noon (the cruise line will tell you boarding begins at 4 PM for 10 PM sail). You'll get right on and be able to enjoy the ship earlier!

<Content>Fabulous Time Husband, daughter  I arrived on April 6th for 4nites. Fabulous hotel, Concierge terrific. Room  bath always very clean; room service prompt. Only downfall was cost of drinks poolside, and food prices at outdoor poolside cafe. Wyndham Condado prices MUCH cheaper for food  drinks. Weather was terrific, ocean so warm you didn't need the pool, which was beautiful. Met great couple from Chicago while there, wish them well. Overall the Intercontinental is a great place to stay, especially since it's so close to the airport, you get more time to vacation before your departing flight back home :)

<Content>Long review of short stay Wife and I (the kids stayed home) stayed for long weekend 3/31 to 4/3. Overall, everything was excellent.BOOKING: Used AAVacations, as we have done before. Best prices, very easy to use, no surprises. Well, one surprise which I'll get to later.ARRIVAL: Quick luggage retrieval at SJU. No customs at all, just walked out of the airport. I know PR is a US territory, but I still expected some sort of customs check. We were told to bring proof of citizenship, but we never needed it. Outside the terminal was a taxi stand with one person ahead of us. About 2 minute wait for taxi, followed by 5 minute ride to hotel ($8 plus .50 per suitcase). Can't get any easier.CHECK-IN: We reserved a super saver room. When I know a hotel will not be crowded (off season, week after holiday, etc.), I usually book the cheapest room upfront and then haggle for an upgrade at the desk. Our desk clerk started his pitch for us to join Intercontinental's rewards program. For $150, we would get an upgrade during this and all other stays at IC hotels for one year, plus other perks. We really didn't need the perks, and we don't plan on staying at any other IC hotels this year, so I wasn't too excited about the deal. The desk clerk then took us on a special tour. He wanted to show us the room we booked and the upgraded room. The booked room turned out to be a 7th floor junior suite overlooking the city. Very nice room, but the view was not exactly tropical. Then he showed us the upgraded room. It was 12 floor overlooking the pool and ocean. Great view, but the room (non-suite) was actually smaller than the other. I figured we don't spend much time in the room, so the ocean view would be nicer. But, I didn't want to pay $150 for it. We went back down to the front desk. I told him I like the ocean room better, but I'll pass on the deal. Unless he could give me the ocean room anyway....which is exactly what he did. Like I said, you can usually schmooze a free upgrade if the hotel isn't crowded. Anyway, I gave him a nice tip just in case he lost out on some commission by not selling me the plan. Other than setting us back some time for this tour, it was a pleasant check-in. He even said that our reservation includes breakfast every day, which was news to me. My reservation documents specifically said no meals. I figured we're gonna eat anyway, so I'll either get a bill at checkout or a nice surprise.ROOMS: I didn't pay very close attention to the city-view junior suite (considered their standard room), but it was large and very nice. Our oceanview room was smaller, though not too small by any means. King bed, sitting area, very small balcony (chair can only fit sideways). Bathroom a little small (crowded with two people), but nicely appointed. Overall luxury on par with Hyatt, Marriott, etc.POOL: A primary reason for staying here. Beautiful lagoon freeform pool with waterfall, surrounded by lots of palm trees. Very clean, nice temp, not crowded. Plenty of lounge chairs.BEACH: Clean, soft sand. Very large beach, so it never seems crowded. Waves churn up the sand at the shoreline, so the water gets murky. Looks great from the room, though. Very short walk to vendors for jetski, parasail, and banana boat. Hotel employees place your lounge chair where you want, and waiters take drink and food orders right on the beach (and at the pool).CASINO: Disappointing to me, but I guess that's the impression you get when you lose. Small compared to most US casinos, but not uncomfortable. For comparison, bigger than Caribe Hilton, but smaller than El San Juan. Most of the island casinos have just one craps table and a few blackjack tables in use. This craps table had a drain at the bottom that just sucked my chips in all the time. We actually did much better (and therefore enjoyed) the casino at Ritz Carlton. Not impressed with El San Juan's casino (next door to IC), though the rest of that hotel is special.NIGHTLIFE: None to speak of, besides casino. There's a lobby bar with a singer at night, but usually a small crowd gathered there. El San Juan next door has much more activity.DINING: Breakfast buffet every day is very good. Not only do they make omelets to order (like most good buffets), but they also make the french toast and waffles right there. Takes a little longer, but much better than mass-cooked french toast sitting in a chafing dish. Breakfast is $18.95. Big price, but in line with other resorts. Also, we ate so much that we didn't want lunch. Add it up and it's not a bad deal. If cost is a concern, there are several options across the street for desayuno, including almost every American fast food chain. We did not eat at any other restaurants at this hotel. Our first night, we went to La Casona. It was our anniversary, so we wanted upscale. Very fancy restaurant about 10 minute ride away from hotel. We had been there before and it was worth the repeat visit. Very expensive. Dinner for 2 with a moderate bottle of wine was over $150. Their wine list is very impressive, and can easily add hundreds to the tab if you want to really splurge. Second night we went to Metropol, which is about a half mile walk from the hotel. Place had all the atmosphere of a local coffee shop, but excellent food. Even with a pitcher of (very good) sangria, check was about $60. Best bargain of the trip--I highly recommend going. Third night we ate at Mi Casita, which is directly across the street from IC. Similar to Metropol (good food, no atmosphere, similar prices), though they serve mainly Puerto Rican food as opposed to Metropol's Cuban food. Honestly, the two cuisines are about as different as Chinese and Japanese. Kinda different yet similar. I recommend both restaurants.CHECKOUT: Always the saddest part of the trip, but here was the surprise. My extras bill totalled $18. Just tips at breakfast and a drink by the pool. No charge for breakfast. AAVacations was wrong, I guess.AIRPORT: Be aware that the American Airlines terminal has almost nothing to eat. Not even a Starbucks or Dunkin, which are usually all over the place. We had to wait 40 minutes at some concession stand for instant coffee at about $2 a cup. I'm not making this up. Make sure you have your coffee and breakfast before you head to the airport.Let me know if you have any questions--rich(at)rannigilbert.com

<Content>Outstanding resort! One of our best vacations! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this resort from the moment the bellman greeted us at the door. The staff was very warm and truly working towards our enjoying our stay. Check in was an ease and they graciously upgraded our room to an oceanfront room. Our bags were promptly brought up for us. The hotel is lobby is beautiful, but the true gem is the gorgeous pool area and beach. The property was so enjoyable, we did not want to leave it! We went into Old San Juan only one day of the 5 nights we stayed and just enjoyed the warm pool, vigorous jacuzzi, relaxing beach, excellent drinks and food by the pool and pool cafe... The pool bar staff were very attentive and made outstanding drinks. There is a spa where I endulged in a 80 minute deep tissue massage that was perfect. There are excellent inexpensive restaurants in walking distance--Luipis a sports bar, mexican grill and Metropole a cuban, puerto rican restauran. One night we ate at the restauarant near the La Playa Hotel that is right on the water that specializes in seafood and ribs and has a breathtaking view of San Juan at night. I will return to Puerto Rico and the Intercontinental.

<Content>First and last visit The beach left much to be desired: the sand was dirty and because of the way the beach is laid out, it's not conducive to small children.The room was worth about half the price we paid. Chipping paint in the room and a bathroom not in the greatest shape (old grout in the shower, stopped up tub drain) made for a huge question mark about the price.Service/staff was pleasant enough and the location is ideal in that it's so close to the airport and Old San Juan tourist areas.The pool was nice and great for kids. They put out a lot of floaties and toys for them to play with, but what a bummer that for the duration of our stay the bar that's inside the pool never opened.We made reservations one night at Ruth's Chris. Let me just say that it seemed like there was NO WAY that restaurant part of the same chain. We eat at Ruth's Chris quite a bit back home and those were NOT the same caliber steak. I wondered whether I was actually eating beef, as did the other 3 people in my group...A disappointment, yes, but a lesson learned for next time.

<Content>The Perfect Winter Getaway... The Intercontinental Hotel is located right next door to the El San Juan Hotel in Puerto Rico but why leave ? This hotel has all the amenities; beautiful grounds with winding pool, hot jacuzzi that fits 30 people, salon, 2 poolside restaurants- one overlooks the beach and ocean with gentle breezes and ultra friendly service. The food is good; salads with chicken, cubano and club sandwiches, etc. You can order from your comfortable lounge chair by the pool or on the beach without missing a beat. I recommend the Club Level rooms which are a little more expensive, but so worth the location; 10 steps from the pool/beach/food. No elevators or long hallways, open the sliders and you've arrived. The bed is comfortable, a small couch and desk ($10 internet access via ether cable) are just inside the glass doors. The Club Level also includes a club lounge mainly for business travelers that is set up 3 times a day with an abundane of on the go type meals and drinks. (bagels, fruit, coffee, cheese/crackers, wine, liquor, etc.) Access the beach through tall iron gates which are locked at 6pm promptly every night. (Try to be inside the gates after dark, wristband required for re-entry) The pool water was a little chilly so we venterd into the warm ocean one day. The waves were a little rough being on the Atlantic side of the island, but it's glorious when the east coast of US is in a deep freeze. Ruth Chris steakhouse is on the property, outstanding, need I say more. There are two other restaurants and a small casino on the property, just enough of a variety without being crowded. Room service is 24 hrs.One night we went nex door to the El San Juan, it was nice to see the beautiful lobby, but unless you're a serious gambler, don't bother. For a quick getaway full of sun and relaxation, Intercontinental is the place to go.

<Content>Great location, beautiful pool and beach This is going to be quick and dirty -- Beach is awesome, great site seeing and people watching. Water is fantastic. Did not get hassled on the beach from vendors which is unusual for the Carribbean.Pool facilities are great -- plenty of pool for all guests. The pool bar was closed during my stay, but it looks like it will be great when it opens up again. Casino -- the worst I've ever been to. BUT, you are right next door to one of the nicer ones in the Carribean at the El San Juan.Hotel Rooms - fine - better than I expected. Little CD player in room - bring CDs. Hotel Dining is great -- the breakfast buffet fit the bill, the menu and food at the Ciao Medditereneo are not to be missed - look to get tables overlooking the beach. Check in can be slow, so US travellers be prepared to wait. The staff is courteous (not so much with the Casino staff / Casino wait staff). If someone dumped $1MM into this hotel it could stand alongside the El San Juan as a premier location. I'd put all of the money into the lobby / Casino - dump the Casino staff and start fresh. The Intercontinental has an amazing location alongside the nicest hotels in SJ, they should do a better job taking advantage of the opportunity. Truly, this hotel's promixity to the PR gem, the Wyndam El San Juan is why you would want to stay here. ESJ has great nightlife from salsa dancing to a very nice casino and amazing bar, you really can't go wrong at the ESJ any night of the week.

<Content>A GREAT GREAT HOTEL My fiance and I just returned from the Inter-Continental a couple of days ago. We stayed from March 9-13 and had a WONDERFUL time. As a matter of fact, I went through a minor depression period before we had to leave :) From the moment we got there to the moment we left, we were treated wonderfully by the entire staff. We originally had a street view room and when we got there we asked to be upgrated to oceanview. They were happy to accomodate us with a beautiful and large oceanview room. The balcony is a bit small, but it was not a big deal in the slightest. The rooms are a bit musty and feel wet, but that did not stop us from enjoying every other aspect of the gorgeous hotel. The pool area is absolutely beautiful with palm treas, waterfalls, and very clean water. We had so many things planned to do during our stay and did not end up doing any of it because we were so happy, pleased, and had such a great time just hanging out on the grounds of the beautiful hotel. The wrist bands (which everyone complains about) are not troublesome in any way. The food on the grounds is very good. We live in NYC and are used to eating out a lot, and even to us the food was exceptional. You must try Passagio, which is located in the hotel because it's wonderful. We had dinner there 2 times but do not get the Chef's Sampler dessert because it's way too small a portion for $10. Ciao's Medditaranean Cafe (located by the pool area) is a wonderful and convinient place to grab lunch. Also, the Splash swim-up bar is awesome. Don't forget to try the Mojito's and the frozen Rum Runners (prepared by Danny the bartender) they are awesome!! We went right before spring break and it was not crowded at all, so make sure when you book your stay it is not during times when it's crowded because that can ruin the experience. El San Juan is literally right next door and also has some wonderful restaurants. Try La Picolla Fontana if you're looking for great Italian.I highly recomend this hotel to everyone. We had a wonderful experience and would return any time!!!

<Content>Beautiful and relaxing My wife and I stayed for four nights at the InterContinental after a cruise we took on Royal Caribbean. The hotel is 15-20 minutes by taxi from Old San Juan and 10 minutes from the airport. The beach was clean and they had complimentary beach chairs and umbrellas. The pool area was amazing. In all, it was both beautiful and relaxing. The staff was friendly and courteous. The room was average.

<Content>Good Hotel - Not the Best Value for Money I thought that the hotel was very nice, although you can get a lot more value for money in other countries (ie Dominican Republic, Cuba or Mexico). I felt very safe while in the vicinity of the hotel, security was posted at all entrances.This hotel is extremly convenient to the airport - I'd even consider walking to and from there if there were any sidewalks there (FYI - there isn't).

<Content>Very nice hotel Just came back from a wonderful vacation at the InterContinential Resort  Casino. My stay was from 3/3 to 3/7  everyday I had a great time. From the minute my friends  I walked into the hotel the staff was very friendly  helpful. The concierge, Nestor, was a great help by recommending restaurants  making reservations for us. There is a Ruth Chris steak house in the resort that you definitely must go to for dinner. Another fantastic restaurant which is only about 8 blocks from the hotel is La Fontana  is located on the top floor of the Howard Johnsons. They have excellent Italian food! Coming from a very Italian neighbor hood in New York I was very impressed. You feel as if you were eatting in a Little Italy Manhattan restaurant. The pool area is very nice with small waterfalls coming into the pool area. The beach is very clean  relaxing. There are workers who will get you chairs  set you up anywhere you would like to sit. Everytime you come in  out of the hotel someone is there to open the door for you. The only one negative about the hotel is the breakfast prices. $18.95 a person for a buffet breakfast is a little expensive to me so it is not something you would want to do every morning. Other then that, you will have a wonderful time!

<Content>Nice enough resort Wife and I stayed here only one night after our flight to NYC was cancelled.Hotel's best feature is its lobby area, which is sharp and attractive. There's a nice lobby bar and an active and lively casino right off of the lobby. The hotel's beach - being on Isla Verde - is very nice for the San Juan area, although generally not as nice as non-San Juan areas or other more secluded Caribbean areas. The pool area has plenty of chairs but feels a little cramped - slightly more reminiscent of the community pool than a pool at a beach resort. The rooms were niced sized and had a decent small balcony but surprisingly musty/mildew-y - additionally, our TV remote didn't work.The location is nicer for the beach than the Condado or Old San Juan areas, as there's less activity in general in the area. However, that also means that there are more nightlife and restaurant options closer to both Condado and Old San Juan than here. Between the nearby Wyndham, Water Club and this hotel, there are a number of good restaurants and bars to be had, but they're mostly chic clubby-types (Tangerine at Water Club) or high end steakhouses (Ruth's Chris and I believe the Palm at IC and Wyndham). There aren't as many good local options - unless you're willing to pay the $12 to cab it to those other areas, which frankly isn't a big deal. So, on the Condado/Old San Juan vs. Isla Verde question, it depends what you're looking for. Quieter and marginally nicer beach? Isla Verde. More activity with a more bustling beach? Condado/Old San Juan.Overall, the next time I'm in Puerto Rico, I'm unlikely to stay here. I'd either choose a true beach resort (such as the Westin Rio Mar, which is very nice but a 40-min ride from San Juan) or a Condado resort with a good enough beach, but a little closer to the other restaurants  activities.

<Content>Intercontinental Divide When is (near) perfection so uninspired?... when one visits The Intercontinental. By typical hotel evaluation parameters, I'd be hard-pressed to state a negative word....every hotel employee was unfailingly friendly and sought to be helpful. The pool area was visually appealing and large enough to accommodate a sold-out hotel. The room was clean, well appointed, and comfortable. The only possible complaints (and minor, to be sure) were the vest-pocket sized casino, and the ineffectiveness of a seemingly well intentioned concierge ...I would be advised that a particular restaurant was unavailable, and then be offered his recommendationas an alternative, only to find that the establishment that I wished to dine at was indeed available...hmmm. What the hotel lacks is a specific personality, any sort of distinctiveness. By comparison, the lobby of the El San Juan on Friday evening fullfilled my fantasies of 1957 Havana, with lusty Latin music playing, and happy dancers crowding the dance floor. The Ritz Carlton announces your arrival with the smell of flowers even before you've finished your turn in their revolving door..The Intercontinental?...It's the Admiral's Club Lounge at the airport...clean, quiet, comfortable, functional in every possible way....yet unceasingly bland.Staying at The Intercontinental is similar to going to a premium ice cream parlor, and ordering vanilla. It may just be the finest vanilla ice cream in the world, but it is unmistakingly vanilla. For some, this will be more than sufficient, for others, not at all.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel The Inter-Continental San Juan is a very nice hotel on a great beach. My experience was very nice. I was upgraded to a Gold level room upon arrival. Room was large and very clean. Opened right onto the pool area. Gold level included breakfast and evening cocktail hour. This hotel is much more relaxed than the Marriott with it's booming music in the pool area. IC hotel also had more chairs available in the pool area. Security is also very good and staff are pleasant.The only draw back to this hotel is that it is in Isle Verde. The beach is great there, but Condado and Old San Juan is where the evening action is. Once the Renaissance and Vanderbilt open in Condado, Isle Verde will be dead. So the IC is a great hotel, but plan on taking a taxi or bus in the evening unless you like hotel and chain restaurants.

<Content>Will try somewhere else next time Stayed 2/12-15/05 Older facility on average beach. Food OK but not memorable; food service ranged from very bad to very good. Given garden view room that roared hotel exhaust into balcony. Only evening entertainment was the casino. Disappointed that the Intercontinental website dropped room prices from the time the reservation was booked until we arrived (and would not even honor their own claim of matching the lowest web price).Area very close to bus, airport, and alternative restaurants. Pool was nice but too cold to use. Staff friendly and spoke English well. Tight security.OK but will take business somewhere else next time.

<Content>Overpriced Intercontinental positive: - friendly staff - free wireless internet connection Negatives : - food swimming pool very mediocre; french fries not tasty; plastic fork and knife in a 4 star hotel ??? - only hotel in the world I have visited where a litre of mineral  water ($8) is more expensive than 2 half-litre bottles (2 x $3). - bathrooms very small and look like have not been re-done since hotel was built (40 years ago?) - rooms were not well cleaned and/or vacumed every day - noisy, with location close to airport - way too expensive, we paid $ 309 per day excl taxes (another  $ 60), excl breakfast. To compare we looked at the Hilton in  Ponce, which is much better value at $ 225 per night and  superior facilities.Summary : We made a mistake and will not go back.

<Content>No complaints Stayed in this hotel in November. Nothing to complain about, great views of planes coming in to land from one side hotel (cannot hear them though), view of beach and sea from other.Concierge was great, chased a few things up for us. On bus route to Old San Juan, supermarkets, restaurants and bars near by. Lovely pool and easy access to beach.IT system being upgraded when checked in but professional staff handled it well.Probably stay there again if we got a good rate.

<Content>Unbelievable staff My wife and I just returned from 4 days at the Intercontinental San Juan from 1/7 - 1/10/05. As much as I travel on business, I can tell you that I've never stayed anywhere that offered the level of personal service that we received here. We did not stay in the 'tower', but instead upgraded to one of the suites next to the pool. We literally walked out of our room and into the tropical pool area. The first night we dined at Ruth's Chris, which, if you've ever eaten there in other cities, you know that they make the greatest steaks around. We were not disappointed. On Saturday, my wife demanded that I go play golf somewhere while she laid by the pool and did absolutely nothing. Unfortunately for both of us, it rained on and off that entire day but it was still very relaxing for her, and I got to play a nice course (Rio Mar at the Westin Resort). That night we ate at Passagio's, their Italian restaurant on site. We were not that impressed, as our waiter was nowhere to be found most of the time, and spoke unintelligible English. On Sunday, with weather forecasts for skattered showers, we rented a car (through the concierge) and drove up Rt 187 which runs along the ocean. Very nice drive and you can even drive right up onto the beach and park for awhile. Sunday night we ate at Fontana De Roma, an Italian restaurant on top of the Howard Johnson's Hotel, about 8 blocks form the Intercontinental. Very nice place, 10th floor over looking everything, and the food was Excellent and the quantities were huge. Loved it. Sure enough, on Monday the sun came out without a cloud in the sky but we had some shopping to do for the kids so we couldn't really enjoy the great weather. Arrive at least 90-minutes before your flight because of their unusual way of checking bags. Not a big deal; just takes a long time.If you have the opportunity to work with Rosie at the Concierge, consider yourself fortunate. She is AWESOME. There's nothing she can't do for you. Also, look for Jose Rivera out front for taxi's and other advice...great guy. All in all, a wonderful stay and we will definitely be returning.

<Content>Too Many Cruise Ship Guests Nice hotel. Refrigerator so you can shop across the street and eat breakfast and lunch in your room. Too many cruise ships use this hotel as a shore tour. Hotel guests have to reserve their pool chaises early or you will not get one.

<Content>Nice Hotel-Great and Friendly Service My family recently returned from a 7-day stay at the Intercontinental over the holidays. Initally, a little apprehensive about the trip as we had never visited Puerto Rico. We were pleasantly surprised as the Intercontinental staff are very attentive and friendly. Initially, our room was not ready so we could not check in until 4:00 p.m. This gave us an opportunity to explore our surroundings. Rooms are small but clean. There were 3 of us (2 adults and 1 8-year old). They recommended a room with double beds which we later found out it would have been better to request a king size bed as those rooms come with a sleeper sofa. We stayed in an ocean view room which was nice, however, the mini suites are much nicer and do not cost that much more (we asked to see the mini and executive suites). We dined at Ruth Chris' and also had the breakfast buffet. Ruth Chris was excellent and the buffet was just ok-not worth a repeat. Pool area is very clean and was not crowded. Beach is nice, however, waves have lots of sand and water is very cloudy. We were told it was due to the time of year. Casino is small, however, we felt it was just enough and the staff in the casino were again friendly. All in all, we intend to return as the pace is slow, hotel is clean and people extremely friendly.

<Content>exceeded expectations We took our 3 children, 2 girls 17 and a 15 year old son for a week to the Intercontinental. We basically chose this hotel because the rates were more reasonable than the El San Juan and Ritz. We booked late and still caught a special where we got our second room at half price. We were extremely nervous about the property because the reviews on this web site were not encouraging. When we arrived, we were pleasantly suprised. The rooms were fine, clean, served the purpose. One night, the air conditioning made some noise. The Hotel staff was fixed the problem and then left a fruit basket in the room, for our troubles. The staff was extremley pleasant and accomodating. The food at the pool was o.k. and service a bit slow but it was very crowded, being Christmas week. Overall, I would not be afraid to book this hotel. The Ritz facility was much nicer but we were paying $200 a night less. The El San Juan was too much of a scene, but the kids liked to go at night. All in all , it was a great trip.

<Content>Great vacation spot My wife, 2 college age daughters  I just came back from 6 days at the IC. As so many of the other reviewers have noted, the staff  amenities at the hotel were fantastic, along with an absolutely beautiful beach. Old San Juan is very attractive but horribly crowded with traffic. The Japanese restaurant at the IC is outstanding. I'd also recommend 3 other exceptional restaurants a short taxi ride from the hotel: Chayote - -------; Marisquer铆a Atl谩ntica - --------;  especially La Casona - ---------. If you take a taxi to Old San Juan or any of the restaurants, do yourself a favor - get the taxi driver's cell phone number  arrange to call for a pick up.

<Content>Perfect Vacation We stayed at the IC over the holidays because of the location, pool, and amenities. We were a bit nervous since there were some bad reviews about service. We only experienced great service. When we had one problem (very late room service) they not only gave us the room service for free but also gave us free lunch. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The rooms are attractive and clean. The view, beach, pool and bars are great. The food is what you would expect from a resort hotel. If you're a foodie go into old san juan for dinner. We thought the casino was nice because it was small and peaceful. This is a perfect hotel for just relaxing at the beach and pool yet conveniently located for taking a taxi into a town or a car to the rain forest.

<Content>Great Hotel My family and I just returned from our six day Christmas trip in San Juan. We were nervous about the hotel, but very pleased. It is old, but has been redone in the last few years. It has local flavor which we liked. We found the hotel simple, yet very comfortable. The staff was very pleasant and always helpful. You are very near the airport and can hear the planes, but this did not bother us. A safe and mini fridge are in all rooms.We loved being close to a grocery and pharmacy for American basics. We walked all over and rented a car for a couple of days for fishing, diving and the rain forest. They were all incredible. The original walled Old San Juan and it's forts were amazing. Be patient the traffic to and from this tight area is heavy all the time. The cruise ships come in this area at times it becomes congested.The beach and pool area at the IC were perfect. The beach chairs and towels are free and they charge for umbrellas. We took our three children that are in college and they loved it. The casino is not good, but we were not interested and never even went inside. There is a wonderful bar and live music at the Old San Juan next door or try the Ritz two blocks down. Their pools and beach areas are nice but smaller. We will go back and maybe explore diving on the other side of the island. Everything moves at a slower pace there, be patient and enjoy. The only rude people we saw were other tourists. A great trip... many adventures or just sit and read by the pool or beach....Austin, Texas

<Content>Excellent hotel! We (my husband and I) just returned from the IC On Nov. 20th from a 7 day stay and I can truly say everything was wonderful. The staff are exceptional and the hotel is kept up morning, noon and night. I would recommend this hotel to anyone interested in staying in a affordable, beautiful hotel right on the beach with anything u could possibly ask for. Rooms are large with a balcony and the grounds are the cleanest I've encountered any where. The Italian restaurant Passagio is fantastic. They have two other restaurants also a Ruth Chris' steak house and a japenese steakhouse. All I can say is that if you stay in the Intercontinental you will not be disappointed, we weren't!

<Content>Loved the InterContinental Everything was great here. Staff is excellent, very friendly and professional. Great service. Beach and pool areas are great. No complaints. Would stay here again. You should rent a car if you want to travel alot. It's a $16 taxi ride into Old San Juan. $10 from airport. Taxis are okay if you are planning to go into Old San Juan once or twice, but if you want to go frequently (like every night for dinner), rent a car. There are other places to go and visit nearby where you don't need a car, such as The Westin and other hotels closeby where there are bars, clubs and restaurants, if you want to go somewhere different than InterContinental.

<Content>Beautiful place! We loved the Intercontinental! Beautiful location, right on the miles-long, gorgeous beach with comfy  clean chaise lounges at the very tropical pool area. Lovely  clean rooms (with no bugs!!!), large-sized with a lot of amenities, including fridge, couch and nice-sized bathroom area. Great food; we ate at the Italian and Japanese restaurants and the breakfast buffet, they were definitely worth the price. We had excellent and attentive service from everyone. I am a very light sleeper and was never awoken by the planes, I only noticed a couple flying over head during our 3-day stay. This is where we will stay our next time in San Juan. Taxis are very easy to get around in and are price regulated. We also stayed at the Wyndham Condado and were VERY disappointed! There is no comparison between the two. Stay here!

<Content>relaxed at the intercontinental Jin, the front desk clerk,did everything to get us a very nice room with a very nice view. he succeeded. the beach was glorious and the staff was very pleasant and friendly, tho' my husband noted that once a staff member was not at their job, they were not very friendly, as opposed to what we find at other caribbean destinations, where smiles and hi are the norm. but at their posts they are a very friendly staff. the rooms are very nice, clean and modern, but very much a typical hotel room. our view from the 14th floor was awesome. we had breakfasts and lunches at the intercontinental. dinners we went next door to the el san juan. the italian restaurant was fabulous-we ate there 3 nights, lobster risotto was out of this world. the mexican restaurant was very good also-10th floor-and with thunder and lightening that night-we were graced with a fabulous light show. we also ate at metropol-a very good puerto rican restaurant. i would have gone back again, but we never had a chance. great island-but san juan proper wouldn't be my first choice with children. this was just a vacation for my husband and me-1st week in november

<Content>Great Vacation! We just returned from a 4 day stay at the IC and can not understand what the previous post is talking about. Our vacation was great. We were never charged a mandatory bellman fee, have no idea what that is! The bellman were always at the door with a smile and friendly hello and always opened the door for us. Security, also, was not an issue for us. In fact, we ran the beach every morining and upon returning to the hotel, there was always a fresh towel and cold bottle of water waiting for us at the entrance from the beach.We were upgraded to an oceanview room (10th floor) and it was lovely. Balcony was a tad bit small but the view more than made up for it. Pool and beach were great. Drinks were a bit overpriced but really normal for any resort in the Carribean. Every meal we had there was delicious. We ate at several restaurants at the El San Juan and all were great.Staff at the IC were wonderful. ALways greeted you with a smile, and were more than willing to help in any way. Pool bar staff was great. Hi to Miguel and Danny and Rosie! I am sure that there are some people that have to find something to complain about no matter where they are. We found the whole experience to be great and look forward to our next trip there.

<Content>Loved the Intercontinental I just don't get how anyone could write a bad review about this resort. Were we all at the same place? We stayed there Oct 24th-28th after a 7 day cruise. We thought it was so nice, much better than I expected after reading all the reviews. The only complaint I have is that the food is WAY overpriced and $5 for a beer is ridicules, other than that it was great. The pool and beach were beautiful and our room was much bigger than an average hotel room. It was a king ocean view room on the 12th floor - very nice. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone going to San Juan.

<Content>Horrible service, horrible casino, HORRIBLE HOTEL The Intercontinental in San Juan was the worst experience I have ever had. About 30 of our friends all went down for a wedding and we all stayed at the hotel. You are charged a mandatory fee for bellmen that stand there chatting instead of opening the door for you. The casino is a JOKE. I dropped $1000 the first night there and had to BEG to get a drink. Then, they didn't want to give my wife a drink because she wasn't playing even though I was betting enough for both of us. The best thing was the dealers in the casino starting talking in spanish about us, and little did they know I speak spanish so I just sat and listened for a while. The security there will annoy the hell out of you. You can't leave your own hotel and come back in without being harrassed. If you go to the pool with one of there $5 can of cokes, they will make you throw it in the trash even though the rules poolside says NO GLASS, nothing about cans. Several of our friends were booked to stay there a week and paid a $250 fee to the airlines just so they could leave early. We will NEVER return there again. When we complained to the corp. office, we were told that they contacted the hotel and they had no record of any of this. How convenient. If you are looking for a HORRIBLE time, look no further.

<Content>Pretty good place Overall, this place was good. Not outstanding, but a perfectly fine place to stay while in San Juan. Very long wait to check-in, but other than that, no service problems. The hotel is nice looking, although the casino is a little worn. The rooms were on the small side and not impressive, but were adequate. We actually thought the rooms would be a bit nicer, based on other Intercontinentals we had stayed at. There were no robes. The pool/beach area was the best part of the hotel. We didn't really use the pool (but it looked nice), but the beach is very nice. Maybe not the best beach in the caribbean, but I thought the sand was fine and the water great. Good temperature, relatively calm, and while not crystal clear, not too murky either. The hotel provides beach chairs at no extra cost. Not sure about umbrellas, but there is shade at the back of the beach. It is a public beach, but this was not at all a problem --- no annoying vendors, etc. The hotel also has a nice little fitness center, no extra charge. When I was researching this trip, I decided to stay in Isla Verde because everyone said it had a better beach than the Condado area, and in this respect, I was not dissapointed. However, a definite drawback of Isla Verde is its isolation. There are not that many restaurants, other than the overpriced hotel offerings. We didn't have bad food at the hotels, but it was nothing to write home about either. Condado has more restaurants, and is closer to Old San Juan. However, if the beach is important to you, Isla Verde is your best bet.

<Content>Great hotel for Post Cruise I'm very confused by the previous review!! We just returned today from the Intercontinental. We found the hotel to be beautiful in all areas. The room was very large with a separate couch and chair sitting area. The pools looked wonderful and the grounds were well kempt. The beach was renting chairs for $3 but there were many nicely cushioned chaises around the pool and overlooking the beach at no cost.The hotels staff provided excellent service and, as I had prepaid, there were no additional charges to the excellent rate.

<Content>loved the intercontinental and ive trvld all over the caribean to the travel agent above. what hotel did you stay at , i am an airline employee and i recived the same rate at this hotel 99.00per nght, and it was a 5 star hotel . the room that i stayed in was beautifully decorated , if anyone stayed at the westin in st.johns its the same rating. this hotel was top of the line......we loved it. just to let everyone know this was not even near motel 6 ,put it this way not even near a hilton.maybe you had an old room but our room was gorgeouse and the bathroom was magnificant. everything was spotless, we even had our sheets turned down for us before we went to bed by the maid...that stinks that you had to pay all that money and you didnt even like it,i thought it was worth every penny

<Content>Good and Bad The good news first. The pool area is wonderful with the palm trees, orchids, waterfall and security. I was disapointed with everything else! After requesting an early arrival (before 4:00 pm) and booking two double's with ocean view my elderly parents and I had to wait for three hours before they got my parents room ready. No ocean view and my room took another hour and a half. I requested a smoking room and received a non smoking, which was ok I could smoke on the terrace until the handle fell off the sliding glass door! The beds in both rooms on the 4th floor were old and the pillow's matched. The next morning my parents bathroom had water all over the marble floor. After almost an hour after reporting the problem I called the manager, Kayla. She gave them a king suite with an ocean view on the 11th floor and a free breakfast. (breakfast buffet for three was aprox. $60.00) She really tried to make it better; It waisted an entire day getting settled. I would definitely think twice before booking this hotel again.

<Content>The Most Terrible Hotel Experience We stayed at the Intercontinental in May 2004 for three days prior to our cruise that was departing San Juan on May12th. We had a Club Level poolside suite! It was no bigger than an average size hotel room. It had no bathtub, just a shower. The location of the room was great, but that was the only aspect of our stay that was great. On the first night, our A/C was not working, we called the front desk and they sent maintenance 2 hours later. He could not fix it, but he could not speak English either, we could not communicate with him, so we just showed him the door to please leave our room. We called back down to the desk and asked to be moved, they informed us in a very rude manner that the hotel was currently full. So, we suffered the heat for three nights, and made the best of our stay, we had no choice. The pool  beach were very nice areas. The beach had chairs and umbrellas that you could rent for $10 each. So $30 later, we were set up on the beach. Even though you pay extra for this service... We were still charged a $40 per day RESORT FEE at check out. I demanded to know what this covered, if it did not cover beach chairs or umbrellas. I was told that it was for security personnel b/c the resort was experiencing security problems. This was scary.... We ate at Ruth Chris', and it did not compare to any others we have eated at, the service was horrible, and food was no better than any other chain staekhouse. It was hard to eat lunch anywhere! The food places had very wierd operating hours. Lunch was terrible when we did find a place open, we ate the same cheeseburger three days in a row. There were no options!!! Overall, it was a very expensive, very over-priced, terrible, hot stay. I regret the day I ever booked this hotel. We are Platinum Priority Card holders and thought that this hotel chain was Holiday Inn's luxury hotel chain. But this was not the case. I have stayed at many other Holiday Inns that were so much better quality and a fraction of the cost. We had used a credit card to pay balance at check out. When I returned home, I did contested all charges, but the hotel would not credit anything back, even though our A/C did not work. I hoped that they would give me at the very least a partial credit for no A/C. I will never stay at an Intercontinental Hotel ever again, nor will I recommend it to friends and family. We travel 4 weeks a year to various places and have stayed in many hotels over the years, and this was by far was our worst stay ever!!!

<Content>Worst Hotel Well I want to start with I am a travel agent and have traveled alot.This hotel was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. I had a travel agent rate of 159.00 per night in May 2004. I felt like I was at a Motel 6. Way overpriced. I am not sure how they justify charging 255.00 per night for a regular rate.The room was so small and the decor is so outdated. The room looked like something from the 1960's. The bathroom was so small and the brass door handles looked so old and like they were never cleaned. When we got to our room there was a fruit platter sitting on the desk that had mold growing on it and it was addressed to someone else. Who knows how long it was sitting there.Then you go out on the balcony and only 1 person can stand on it because its very very small.The pool was dirty and not very appealing. We were confirmed for 3 nights and as soon as we got to our room we wanted to leave.They have an early check out fee of 100.00 which I gladly payed to go home.We ended up paying 307.41 for 1 night. The front desk refused to waive the early check out fee for us. I tell all of my clients how horrible this hotel is. When I booked the Intercontinental I expected to have a nice hotel like the one in Chicago.

<Content>Excellent resort Had a great time at the Intercontinental Hotel the night before and the night following a cruise out of San Juan. I really enjoyed the pool/beach area and the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. Very nice property!

<Content>Great room with a great view I stayed at the Intercontinental from August 26 -30 my room had a view to die for pretty blue water and that's what you need living in New York City. Overall the staff was very helpful with the expection of the valet staff. (you would think that the people that greet you upon entering the hotel would be pleasant). My overall experience was great. I would recommend this hotel to all of my family and friends.

<Content>An Exceptional Experience at the InterContinental San Juan I recently returned from an exceptional stay at the InterContinental San Juan (8/17-8/25). The hotel was lovely and very well maintained. It was worth it to forfeit the city view junior suite that was originally reserved for a room on the 14th floor with a magnificent ocean view. The pool area is beautiful and relaxing, with access to a pristine beach just steps away. Dining at the hotel is excellent. The breakfast buffet at La Terraza is wonderful and worth waking up for. For dinner, Passagio is highly recommended with a lobster ravioli entree that is outstanding. The entire staff is professional, courteous, and attentive to every detail. Elaine and Victor at the front desk are welcoming and accomodating to every need. Samantha, a server in the pool area is delightful. However, Miguel, the manager of La Terraza deserves the most recognition. He is amazingly kind and helpful and truly an asset to the hotel. Puerto Rico was absolutely beautiful and I would love to go back one day.

<Content>Great location, great facilities, excellent staff We stayed at the Intercontinental from 8/21 to8/24. On our arrival we received great service from the concierges on duty. Both of them helped in getting an excellent room for us. We began with Nestor who worked so hard to help us and were joined by his associate who did his utmost to help us out.  We were pleased with all aspects of the hotel.Some are mentioned in previous reviews listed before. The lagoon like pool with the beach after is a real plus. All staff were attentive from security to the valet parking. We did not eat at the hotel as we were interested in local less expensive cuisine. There are many places in the area. One in particular run by people from San Juan was called Mi Casita. It is across the street from the hotel and offered breakfast specials for $ 2.50 and reasonably priced dinners in the afternoon. Open 7 am. - 4 p.m. If you choose to see more of Puerto Rico I would suggest renting a car and visiting Luquillo beach and El Yunque rain forest. About an hour or so on Route 26 East from the hotel area. We also made the drive south to Ponce on route 52. It took about 1 1/2 hours from San Juan. There is a free trolley tour that leaves every half hour or so from the Plaza Delicias in the center of old Ponce. The people there, as is true of most of Puerto Rico, were very friendly and proud of their city. On the trolley we met a retired policeman who enriched our trip by telling us so much about Ponce and its history. He wasn't a guide but rather taking the tour with his grandson. We met so many helpful people like him on the trip. While in San Juan you may want to take advantage of the ferry to Catano. It cost fifty cents. Not a bad price for a ride across San Juan Bay. Once you get to Catano you can take a cab for about two dollars per person to the Bacardi Rum plant for a free tour. Of course they promote it endlessly but at the end you get two free drinks and the tour is fun. The ferry leaves from Pier 2. This is the pier before the cruise ship terminal. There is a parking garage in back of the bus terminal nearby. I would not hesitate to return to San Juan, the hotel was great and the people were friendly.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation! The Intercontinental is absolutely beautiful! From the moment you pull up to the hotel you're welcomed with beautiful plantings, trees, a waterfall, etc. The hotel itself is clean; everyone (for the most part) is very friendly  helpful, the pool area is gorgeous surrounded by a beautiful courtyard, fountain, many beach chairs, swim up bar, waterfall, jacuzzi, etc. It really was great! The beach was nice, pretty empty  quiet while I was there (8/15-21) but it gave me the chance to relax  enjoy the beach without distraction. The first night we stayed in a damp, musty, mildewy room (1119)  we complained  they moved us to another room which was perfect. The rooms are very nice with modern furniture, the bathroom was clean, the balcony was small but served its purpose. The location is nice but somewhat far...I thought Isla Verde was nearby to downtown San Juan. It's not. Don't get me wrong, the location is great, being that you have a nice shopping plaza across the street with a Super Market, a great, affordable restaurant Mi Casita  more. You can take the bus to Old San Juan for .25 cents but it takes about 40 minutes or so. The cab fare, I heard, was $16 each way. The bus really wasn't bad at all. Old San Juan was awesome, beautiful buildings, historic sites, a must see! I would def. stay at the Intercontinental again, it really is a nice, well-maintained hotel. If you've ever been to Cancun, the Intercontinental is comparable to the Palace resorts. Try the Pina Coladas, they're delicious! Enjoy =)

<Content>Disagree with Florida traveler I also just returned from a vaction at the InterContinental hotel and it does not even compare with the El San juan. The pool at El San Juan is so beautiful compared to to the dirty pool at the Intercontinental. I too was very annoyed with staff members. The El San Juan is a very classy hotel that is why proper attire is required in order to enter the casino. At the Intercontinental you can gamble with your bikini on. Funny how 2 people have different reviews that stayed at the same place. Wonder why????????

<Content>Don't understand the negative reviews My friends and I just retruned from a 5 day stay at te Intercontinental. We were a little nervous after reading some of the negative reviews but after our experience I would not only stay there again, I would recommend the hotel to anyone interested in staying in Isla Verde. The rooms are average size / decor but very clean. Terraces are very small but the the view was spectacular. The staff was extremely friendly (with the exception of one person by the pool who was INCREDIBLY rude!) and willing to help you with anything. The pool and beach were clean and beautiful. Security guards were constantly making rounds but they were also extremely friendly and not a nuisance at all. The dress code was a little strict but nothing to complain about. There is a lower level that will take you right to the pool which alleviates this problem. The drinks were great, you must try a Voodoo Juice (delicious!). Can't give much of an opinion about the food other than it was expensive. However, if you're looking to eat real Puerto Rican food like we were you'll probabably skip the hotel returants all together.

<Content>Beautiful! I just got back from a 4 night visit to San Juan . We stayed at the Intercontinential and overall it was a great experience. The resort itself was very nice and atmosphere was great. The pools were big and nice. I loved the rocks waterfall and the hot tub. It was just a big pool. There are no kiddy pool but the water was just 3'6 so it wasn't so bad. There were plenty of cushion chairs all over the swimming area. The beach was beautiful and clean. There was security which I thought was tight and a great idea. You had to wear a wrist band (which is a different color everyday) to go to the pool or beach. You also will need that to get towels. The service was great, especially the concierge. I got to meet Nester, which was a pleasure. He was very helpful and he's probably reading this (Hi Nester, I'm the lady that you helped on my birthday and told you about this website! by the way, Happy Belated Bday to you also!). Nestor was very helpful in helping me getting another room. I saw his name badge and told him how I heard about him and about this website. The other lady with the short brown hair and the chief concierge (which I didn't get names)were all very helpful and great with giving us directions. So I thought the concierge was exceptional! The bellman and the valet parking guys were great too. They opened the doors for you and made you feel like royalty. I had to kids with us and they were very nice about it. Although, I would say that this is definitely not a kid friendly hotel. My boy was playing in the lobby and the head security guy had to come get us to take him away. The pools close at 7pm which I thought was pretty early compare to the resorts in the US. It gets pretty dark early there also. The casino was small but had all the tables. There was also poker tournaments being held weekly (I think). I went during the day and the way they played blackjack is so different from casinos here. The dealer only get one card which he flips for us to see, but he doesn't get a second card until the entire table is done so it's so hard to win. My husband said at night they play the regular blackjack way..so I'm all confused. Oh the dealers do not smile or talk or even say hi to you. They are like a standing robot..no emotions at all!! The dealers that I had forgot to flip her cards a few tiimes and we had to remind her and they even hit for you not evening seeing if you want to hit or not. .it's an automatic thing.. how funnyMy only complaint is the rooms was on the small side especially the bathroom and the bedspread had fuzz balls all over it, so do not sleep on it! I'm not sure if it has ever been cleaned! There are many restaurants in walking distant: BK, pizza hut, wendy's, KFC, churches, dominos, ponderosa, and many others if you don't want to eat at the hotel. I must say if you are a wing lover like I am, try the baseballl wings at Lupis which is just past Wydham El San Juan hotel. It's really reasonalbe priced and good. A lot of people do not speak English so make sure you know what you're ordering and where you're going. We had trouble with the language barrier. Old San Juan is a must see..very beautiful but had problem parking. It's a pain to find parking space and the driving lane is BAD!!! so be careful. It's so tight and they are really bad drivers. The rainforest is also a must see.. make sure you have tennis and ready to walk.Overall, we will return one day again. The hotel was nice with exception the rooms...

<Content>Relaxing vacation This resort was FANTASTIC! The place was just beautiful. People were so friendly and kind. They made you feel like one big family. We went to the Ritz Carlton to check it out and it wasn't as nice as the intercontinental. It was so stark in it's gardens. The outside was plain, MUCH smaller beach than ours. By far the intercontinental was much nicer. Always security around but you didn't notice them. I would go back in a heatbeat. I have been to MANY islands and this is on the top of my list. Much to see and do there. Great pool, restaurants. You MUST make this a place to visit.

<Content>Great Hotel My fiance and I just got back from PR and the Intercontinental San Juan was great; whoever had anything negative to say must have stayed somewhere else. The pool and the beach were beautiful and clean. The staff for the most part was very friendly and the security is tight. If possible, we highly recommend a room on the ocean side (not the city) - the view was awesome. We got lucky because we booked through Expedia and there's no guarantees on what room you get; we had 14th floor oceanview! Our only complaint on the hotel was that the restaurants were extremely expensive, particulary the casual dining (breakfast and lunch). We're talking about $10 eggs, burgers and dogs! We recommend eating across the street at the shopping center. Mi Casita is a great place for breakfast and affordable (never had lunch or dinner there). But there other fast food places and eateries like Ponderosa or Pizza Hut for lunch. There are many other nice restaurants in the other hotels and surrounding area that are affordable for dinner such as Outback in Embassy Suites, Tequila in the El San Juan (right next door), and Sonny's which is at the end of the beach. We do suggest dinner at the Japanese Restaurant in the Intercontinental - it was a good time. We obviously did not stay during the busy season, so not sure if the service is the same during that time period. We would definitely go back and try to recruit some friends to come as well.Side note: Make sure you ask the taxi driver how much $ before you get in. The rates seemed to vary a couple of times from driver to driver.

<Content>Beautiful hotel and wonderful service I just got back from Puerto Rico and the Inter-Continental hotel. We had a shaky start to out visit when our toilet overflowed, but the hotel took care of that immediately and moved us to an even better room. The next day they brought my husband and I a tray of cheese and fruit with crackers and a bottle of wine for the trouble we had the day before. That was a very nice touch and really impressed us. All the grounds of the hotel are beautiful and clean. The pool and beach are wonderful and so was the spa where we got massages.Our only complaint was the entertainment in Puerto Rico. They don't play anything but Salsa and that can get boring after a while. We like all different kinds of music and just hearing salsa all the time really bored us. We also would have liked to have seen a show, but there are no shows of any kind in Puerto Rico. I asked and the only answer I was given was go next door to the El San Juan and watch the salsa contest. That was not what we wanted to see. I think all of Puerto Rico could benefit by adding some kind of shows to their hotels for the entertainment of guests because not everyone is a fan of salsa or wants to listen to it constantly.As for the restaurant MiCasita that I heard so many things about. Well my husband ordered the mofongo to try and it was just terrible. Even the octupus salad he ordered was terrible. Thank god I got shrimp because you can't ruin shrimp that much. I would not recommend Mi Casita to anyone we both thought it was terrible and my husband will eat anything and he didn't eat that mofongo. Stick to the restaurants in the hotel they are terrific. We ate at Passagio and the food was so good that you wanted to lick you plate. Just stay away from MiCasita across the street.Old San Juan was quaint and cute and we bought some jewelry and souveneirs there and enjoyed the history so that is a place to see. Sorry we couldn't be more positive about Puerto Rico and this has nothing to do with the hotel because it is first rate.

<Content>Excellant Stayed at the IC in late June. Hotel is very nice and is minutes from the airport. The airplanes are not that close to be noisy. Hotel has a Ruth Chris which we went to and was excellant. We also tried the Japanese restaurant for sushi which was also good.The pool is large and very nice with a swim up bar. The beach is right off the pool and is really nice. You can walk next door about 100 yards to the Wyndham El San Juan. They have 4 or 5 excellant restaurants including The Palm.Overall one of the nicest hotels we saw in PR. If I went back I would stay at the IC or El San Juan. Be carefull there are other Wyhdhams in PR, you want the El San Juan, not the Condado!

<Content>Nice, pleasant place Stayed in June 2004. All around a very pleasant stay. Swim up bar and general pool area is clean and attractive. The beach is not the best, but that is due to the hotel's location in Isla Verde. The rooms are small but cozy, with nice looking furniture and a small terrace. The casino is small, but adequate for the hotel guests. Casino equipment is ill maintained, particularly the video poker machines, which are in short supply, and half of them don't work. There is food, ashes, cigarette butts, and some garbage on the machines and the surrounding area. Definitely need to clean up the casino. The staff is pleasant. My only complaint is the $75 hold put on my credit card per room in case I incurred any charges during my stay, that I would not have money with which to cover at the end of my stay. My credit card was close to max, and the pre-charge took me over the max, preventing me from making purchases on the card. Had I been forewarned, I would have taken another card. Beachside restaurant food was nice but a bit pricey (their $12, so-called 1/4 pound hamburger is closer to 1/8 of a pound). Also, too many mosquitos. If you rent a car, the parking for the hotel is across the street and it's $10 per day. Lots of inexpensive eating options in the neighborhood.

<Content>Not bad for Puerto Rico resort hotel The hotel is best for those who are light sleepers (noisy given the airport), rise early, and spend most of the day at the pool, beach, or fitness center. These hotel attributes are wonderful, and the pool is one of the better ones I've encountered in my travels. The gym equipment is not exactly new, but the view of the beach compensates for their age. The room is standard with no frills, but that is fine if you are out at the pool or Old San Juan anyway. The staff is not rude, but they are also not generally friendly or accommodating (I have no complaints or general complements). I got a good rate, and, at a similar rate, would stay there again. Interesting note: An elderly couple staying at the Wyndham wished to see our room for a future stay in San Juan. They said the room was nice, and commented that the IC rooms are much newer than the rooms in the Wyndham. I have heard much about the need for the Wyndham next door to refurbish and modernize their room.

<Content>What you see..is what you get. The hotel grounds were beautiful! The hotel was clean and the rooms were very nice. Some of the staff was very friendly but some of them were not and when you asked them questions about the hotel itself...they didn't know about their own hotel!This was a bit frustrating. The casino is small but entertaining, men must wear pants at night. Puerto Rico itself was very pretty but pricey. Renting a car is definately a must and it's very easy to drive and get around in Puerto Rico. In Old San Juan parking was a nightmare so you may have to walk but it's worth walking around. The forts were very stunning and worth going to. It's nice to take a map and explore the beaches some of them are not crowded and the water was nice and warm. El Yunque Rainforest has a good hike to one of the waterfalls but definately take your tennis shoes it's slippery and alot of people were wearing sandals and complained of it being to slippery. Overall the people are not all that friendly in Puerto Rico but the good thing is most everyone speaks english so communication is not an issue. Overall Puerto Rico is a beautiful place, lots of places to see and I will go back.

<Content>Great Vacation I statyed at the Intercontinental with my family of 8 from June 19 through the 26th and we could not have had a more wonderful experience. Before we even arrived at the hotel, I contacted the hotel directly and requested rooms facing the ocean on the same floor and we received them. By calling the hotel directly, I was also able to get a terrific rate for one of their suites for me and my wife. I also spoke to the conceirge, Nestor, before we arrived and he was able to arrange for a van for us for the week (somethig I recommend if you paly golf-Dorado is 30 minutes west) or sight seeing ( The rain forest and old San Juan). The staff was great; the casino intimate; and the food good. Ruth Chis's was ok; the japanese place fun. I have four kids ages 18 through 22 who found the night life great in the Isla Verde section. The property is secure and safe; the rooms (we were on the 16th-top floor) clean and nicely decorated; the pool and beach area fantastic (plenty of chairs); and the fitness center, steam and suana more than adequate. Tip: Try the spa. Great thing about the hotel was it was across the street from a market so we saved money on soda etc; and were able to walk to nearby restraunts where the food was excellent. We will definitely go back.

<Content>No major complaints here We stayed at this hotel last summer. The positives seemed to outweigh the negatives for us. Negatives...the lobby furniture was rather worn, and needs to be updated. Food was just a little pricey, but not outrageous. The hotel is located near the airport, so you can hear the roar of plane engines as they take off.Neutral...the room was neither horrible, nor fantastic. It was an average room you might get at a Westin, Crown Plaza, Hilton, etc.Positives....beautiful pool area with swim-up bar. We found the beach to be immaculate when we were there, along with feeling safe. The food was pretty good (not spectacular, but not horrible either). We found the staff to be friendly.  Overall, while the Wyndam also looked nice, we wouldn't hesitate to return here either.

<Content>Disagree with Brooklyn reviewer I have to disagree with the Brooklyn review. Were we staying at the same hotel??? We knew ahead of time that the taxes are 20%, something you should have asked prior to your reservations. They are not hidden charges if you do your homework and ask in advance. We thought the staff was wonderful, very friendly and helpful. Infact, we kept saying thru out our stay how friendly everyone was that worked there. The concierge, Nestor, was the best. We used our Priority Points and were upgraded upon check in to Ocean front room. He gave us maps and directions to all of our sightseeing destinations. We had an extended check out also. We thought the pool was clean and the drink staff and security around the pool were very friendly. WE had a birthday dinner for my husband at Ruth's Chris was was astounding, food and service was excellent. There is also another good restaurant called Passagio and we were given VIP service. We walked over to the El San Juan and weren't too impressed with the decor, very dark. We weren't allowed into the casino because we were too casual??? We did eat at both restaurants on the 10th floor at the El San Juan, very good and casual. Drinks are expensive and so is food, but that comes with vacationing. I don't know why you think El San Juan is excellent, it seemed average to us. We thought the Intercontinental was by far the nicest hotel in Isla Verde and The Ritz was nice too. Funny how we had different reviews for the same hotel, same time. Wonder why?

<Content>THE WORST SERVICE I just returned from a trip to Puerto Rico June 2004. I have been to Puerto Rico numerous times and stayed at the El San Juan(which is excellent). This time I stayed at the Intercontinental, the staff ruined our vacation. First beware of hidden charges like beach taxes and pool maintance fees. The pool was dirty so I do not know who is keeping the maintance money!! The pool closed early on a Saturday for a private party. I also purchased a raft at the hotel store and they said it was ok to use at the pool. On Sunday I was asked to take it out of the pool because there was too many people. The maid service is terrible if they bother to come at all. The concierge desk had to be the worst of all the employees. We were charged extra for someone else's room that was friends of ours. Since the hotel didnt bill them for a 4th person and they left earlier. They decided to charge my room because someone had to pay as I was told. I spent my last day of my vacation fighting charges that didnt belong to my room. After several employees told me they would take care of this. And nothing was ever done. They will not even give you extended check out. Even the Ruth Chris restaurant at the hotel had flys in their water!! This was the worst hotel experience due to the hotel staff. The casino workers are very nice (obviously). And the towel lady was nice at the pool. Basically if you are looking for a hotel that does not value their guests then stay at the Intercontiental

<Content>Nice getaway My wife and I used Priority Club Points for a stay last week. We were pleasantly suprised by the quality of the hotel. Our checkin was smooth and wre were given a ocean front room on the 11th floor. The room was clean and nicely furnished with a King size bed and a fold out couch. Teh small balcony was large enough for one of us to sit. We spent most of our time on the beach and by the pool sipping rum runners and pina coladas. There was no fee for using the beach chairs or towells as someone reported earlier. We did not find the wristbands to be of any hindrance. In fact, we like dthe fact that they kept outsiders from wandering into the pool area. The beaches were clean and we were not hasseled by vendors, although there were plenty of folks offering drinks and other refreshements.Directly across the street from th ehotel is a small shopping center with all of the necessities, a supermarket, Subway, gift shop, and a nice cafe, Mi Casista, for an economical breakfast. I was able to but beer at teh supermarket and using a small cooler, drink it poolside or on the beach with no hassles. This was a great way to keep the spending down (Especially at $5/beer or $8-10 for a frozen cocktail). The pool waitresses were excellent, especially Rosie.We did not eat any meals at the hotel restraunts. We had a nice dinner at The Palm at the ESJ and anoth night ate at the Japanese Resturant at ESJ. Both were good though pricey. We also ate one night at Lupi's Mexican Place down the street and it was of good quality and we enjoyed the outdoor dining. We usually ate leftovers or Subway for lunch.Did not spend any time in the IC casino, but did manage to lose a few bucks at the ESJ casino. The ESJ is definitell more hapening at night and we would people watch in the lobby. At the sugestion of Jozell, the excellent consierge, we went on a kayaking trip to see the bioluminescent bay at Cabeza de San Juan. It was memorable experience and well worth the $70/person. The forts at Old San Juan were nice, but the area itself was too much like Charleston, Savanah, or new Orleans to be unique to us. We would definitely go back to San Juan and the Intercontintal again.

<Content>Great Isla Verde Hotel We stayed at the Intercontinental over Memorial Day weekend and it was great. The oceanfront/poolfront rooms are an adequate size, although the bathroom is tiny. The pool area is very nice - with both covered and sunny areas - perfect if you want to keep your kids in the shade while you catch some rays. Although not really advertised on their website, there is a decent oceanfront fitness area and a spa, where both my husband and I enjoyed our treatments. The only restaurants we tried were the Ciao Mediterrean Cafe and Momoyama (japanese). The service at the Ciao Cafe was horribly slow every single time we ate there, although the food was fine for poolside/beachside. It is especially nice to get a drink at the cafe (which is right on the beach) at sunset. The sushi from Momoyama was delicious, albeit pricey. We also tried Mi Casita across the street for very cheap breakfasts. The casino was smaller than the Wyndham El San Juan but perfect for light gamblers - and the slot machines at IC really do pay - I won $750 at the IC slots!! The Wyndham El San Juan is right next door and the Italian restaurant La Picola Fontina was terrific. The Wyndham El San Juan is quite a scene on the weekends and it was great fun to visit the lobby bar and people watch. But the weekend bar crowd at the El San Juan was a bit rowdy - with the partying going on all night and some people actually sleeping at the El San Juan pool area. We were very happy to retreat back to the IC after visiting the El San Juan scene. The security at IC was very effective and would not have allowed revelers to sleep overnight at the IC pool. We thought IC was a good choice for families even though it didn't really have a kiddie pool - only a very shallow end of the regular pool. No one charged us for towels or chairs and there did not seem to be any 8am rush to reserve pool chairs. There was ample supply of chairs.We had our nicest meal at Ramiro's in Condado where the food and service was the most fantasic I have had in a long while. The staff at Ramiro's was so accomodating it was incredible. We arrived at the restaurant and our 13 month old baby was sleeping and, of course, we had left our stroller in our hotel room. The host offered us a semi-private room and actually made a cushioned bed on the floor (with mutiple fine tableclothes) for the baby to sleep while we ate. When the baby woke up, the host brought a real highchair - not one of those wooden generic highchairs, but the type of high chair you'd have in your home. The waiters at Ramiro's were also excellent - suggesting many off-the-menu options and were amenable to all sorts of specific food requests (low salt/low carb/no dairy). If you visit San Juan, definitely stop in Ramiro's for an unforgettable meal.We also visited El Yunque (the rainforest) which was about an hour away. We rented a car and drove ourselves. It was very beautiful, but I would recommend sneakers or other shoes with great traction and absolutely no strollers - the whole hike was extremely slippery. We took the baby in a baby backpack carrier on the shortest hike to La Mina Falls - which was very scenic and about 35 mins down and 25 mins back up. Renting a car was a good choice for us as it can be $15 each way to Condado or Old San Juan, which adds up fast. The valet parking at IC was not cheap though - $16/night. The hotel boasts onsite Avis car rental, but the Avis station was really offsite - you had to take shuttle bus to rent a car so it was not as convenient as it sounded. Still, the concierge and staff at IC were very helpful. We will definitely return to IC.

<Content>Great vacation getaway The InterContinental was a great vacation getaway. My husband and I just returned from our anniversary trip and we had a great time. The hotel was nice, clean, and had all of the amenities. We enjoyed the pool and beach areas. The casino was not as nice as we expected, but we played long enough to receive comps for most of the meals that we consumed during the trip. We walked next door to the Wyndham to party and gamble a few times because it was definitely more lively over there. However, we enjoyed our hotel when we just wanted to relax.

<Content>great hotel, so so beach front Hotel is very nice, must visit old san juan, ruth's chris is expensive but worth every penny, beach had too many people selling things - got sick of saying not interested Taxi rides will blow your mind! Beach had a lot of washed up weed and wasn't as nice as Cancun. I never paid for towels, beach use or chair use??? We booked hotel and airfare for 350 a person for 3 nights from Maine on site59, great deal for the money, would go back for under 500 a person air/hotel. Food directly across the street is good and inexpensive, breakfast for 3-4 dollars, lunch 5-6 bucks. Hotel breakfast is 18+ each.

<Content>Enjoyable if Expensive The Intercontinental was enjoyable. The staff were friendly and the concierge was very helpful. The rooms were unimpressive, but we spent most of our time outside having fun anyway. The beach was clean and the water was great for my psoraisis. The hotel was very relaxed and quiet, and for clubs, nightlife, etc, you can always walk next door to the Wyndham (which is much more expensive, BTW).Isla Verde is not near most of the sights, and I recommend taking the bus to get out to Old San Juan, etc. Taxis to Old San Juan are nearly $20; while the bus is 25 cents. The bus ride is about 30 minutes. The local restaurants are brutally expensive. Expect to pay $100 for two at mid-priced restaurants. I recommend Metropol, if you're interested in something more representative of local cuisine, and you want to save a few bucks. Ciao Mediterranean Cafe is also nice, and right on the beach, if you want to save $.We booked the trip with Expedia and I would advise against selecting in advance their prepackaged tours (i.e., bus trips to El Yunque Rain Forest, etc.). The company handling the tour was very disorganized and unclear about when (or whether) the tour would even take place, even two days after we had already gotten to Puerto Rico. The hotel has a company on site that will guarantee that your tour will take place. I would also advise against taking a tour to Luquillo Beach. The grounds were a mess, and the bathrooms were unsanitary.

<Content>Absolutely beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We stayed at the Intercontinental for one night at the end of a cruise we took in March. I LOVE THIS HOTEL! For the brief version, gorgeous grounds, absolutely relaxing, very secure, on the beach, swim up bar, nice room, great pina coladas, close to airport without hearing airport noises, etc.Longer version: I would consider myself to be extremely picky when it comes to hotel rooms. I couldn't find anything wrong with the room. It was very clean and had a gorgeous view out of the balcony overlooking the ocean. (Okay, if I have to admit something I read on trip advisor before going to San Juan, it did have a slight musky smell, which according to reviews on trip advisor, EVERY HOTEL DOES. It is the caribbean and is to be expected It certainly wasn't bad enough to make me not want to stay here.)In total honesty, we enjoyed the hotel so much that we are wanting to go back as soon as we can. The only thing we were disappointed in was that we were stupid enough to take a Carnival cruise instead of staying at the Intercontinental for the entire week. The pool area is absolutely beautiful. I think I read somewhere else that the security around the pool was annoying. I have to say that it was actually a good thing for me because I felt very secure.The Intercontinental is definitely somewhere I will go back to. In fact, originally when I first read comments on trip advisor, had I not booked through Hotwire, I would not have chosen this hotel. However, now, after actually staying there and seeing how wonderful it is, I will be booking directly through the hotel out of fear to not get to stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Stay at the Wyndham next door instead... My boyfriend and I just spent the weekend down there and we were both very disappointed considering the other reviews (some very good) and the image of InterContinental as a whole - the staff was unattentative, you are nickel'd and dime'd for everything, the security around the pool was just annoying, the dress code to get into the casino was a standard that was set way too high considering what the inside of the casino looked like and what it had to offer, and it was really overpriced considering what we got ($17 for a Cobb salad down by the pool bar w/ shrimp from a can - yuck!)... the beach was really dirty, the room was okay - we got massages at the spa there which were not worth (worst massages we ever got) and overall we just don't recommend the InterContinental in San Juan (frankly, we're not going to be recommending any of our friends or family to got to Puerto Rico. Period.)

<Content>Great Easter Vacation I stayed at the Hotel with my wife and two teenage sons. The hotel facilities are excellent and the concierges were extremely helpful with dinner reservations and restaurant recommendations. Iwas borned in the island and have stayed in many resorts in PR. I think the beach is one of the best in Puerto Rico. The casino is small but it has a friendly atmosphere. It conveniently located near a mini mall (if you don't want to spend a lot of money) and for night life you can just walk next door to El San Juan and enjoy the music (without having to pay the higher rates). I strongly recommended even if you are just staying before or after a cruise.

<Content>Family Friendly and Safe My family spent 4 nites at the Intercontinental Easter Weekend. It was wonderful!! We were traveling with my mother and wanted connecting rooms. Although the manager could care less and did nothing to honour our request, the gentleman (Cliff) at the front desk was wonderful and worked hard to make it happen. The conecierge was also great, offering information on how to get to the Rainforest and securing us a minivan. All of the staff that we came in contact with were very friendly including bartenders, waitstaff at restaurants, pool attendents, and housekeeping. All went out of their way to entertain our children ages 4 and 6. There was an ample supply of towels at the pool, plenty of chairs comfortably spaced, and everything was clean (I'm big on that). Security was very good as the hotel supplied wrist bands to assure that the pool grounds were used only by hotel guests. There was an army of friendly security personel, they were dressed nicely in suits (not like police) and helped to make my family feel safe. There were waitresses from the hotel offering to bring drinks and food out to guests on the public beach that is in front of the hotel. There were plenty of chairs on the beach for hotel guests. We wanted for nothing except our drinks which took forever at Chao Medditeranean the beach bar/restuarant. The rest of the food including room service was resort expensive, but very good. Easter brunch was very good but extremely overpriced at 38.00 pp. C'mon it's a buffet! Despite the price we enjoyed ourselves as there was a traditional Puerto Rican music and dance show and my children had a blast at the Easter Egg Hunt where they were given baskets and found tons of candy and egg shaped sidewalk chalk. WED RETURN IN A HEARTBEAT!!! WISH I COULD HAVE STAYED LONGER!!

<Content>InterContinental was amazing! I CAME ON THIS SITE about a week ago to read the comments on the IC and was shocked to read such horrible things about the place i was preparing to visit. Then as i scrolled down i read more comments that made me think if these people stayed at the same place. One new yorker made the IC sound like complete trash and a waste of time and money, while a person from Boston (a former NYer) made the IC sound amazing. Now that i came home from my relaxing, and amazing vacation in San Juan from the IC i have to say, I DISAGREE WITH ANYONE WHO SAYS THE IC IS TRASH, CAUSE I HAD THE MOST AMAZIN TIME, from the friendly staff, to the dancing and live music at the pool on Easter Sunday, I dont know what else someone could ask for. There was the beach directly behind the hotel, a casino inside, beautiful landscape, delicious restaurants right down stairs, and the staff that helped set up excursions. My family and I went to the El Yunque Rainforest, we hiked up and down beatuiful open wildlife, natural habitats to home for many species, not to mention the dip we took in the natural pool at the bottom of a water fall. San Juan had and has so much to offer, the weather was beautiful, i woke up put on a bathing suit, headed to breakfast, sat outside, and realized this was heaven. The tiny amount of rain was in the morning on one of the days i was there but other then that it was always SUNNY and warm. The beverages alcoholic and non, were a great addition to lounging in the sun, while reading the book i brought down with me. My parents enjoyed every moment of the trip, my grandmother found things to do, as well as my sister. No matter what age you are, or as large as the family and friends you plan on traveling with, Intercontinental should be your top choice. You are situated next to the El San Juan Wyndam, which is more fancy and maybe larger with the casino and lobby, but i found the IC to be more comfortable, less like a fashion show, and more like the laps of luxury. I believe anyone who says the IC is not one of the best places to stay, is lying, because i can't imagine ever staying anywhere else. IC made my vacation PERFECT!

<Content>InterContinental - - The Best My wife, my son, and I decided to go to Puerto Rico and we stayed at the InterContinental. It was totally AWESOME. We had a room overlooking the pool/ocean. The rooms are really nice, clean, and spacious. The hotel is close to the airport which is convienient yet we never really notice any aircraft noise. The best part of the stay was the hotel staff. From check in to departure everyone was friendly, courteous, professional, and they take care of their guest. The InterContinental is in a great location with everything you could possibly want and/or need inside the hotel or right outside the hotel (fine dining, fast foods, shops, grocery store, bus stop, etc.). If you are going to Puerto Rico, the InterContinental is the place to stay. I read all of the reviews of this hotel before we went to PR and after our return I don't understand how anyone could be negative about the InterContinental. We can't wait to go back to Puerto Rico and of course you know where we are going to stay . . . I'd rate our experience a perfect 10 on a scale of 1-10.

<Content>Intercontinental san Juan - Average to below Overpriced. Outdoor restaurant poor. Beach in all of San Juan area is dirty. Furniture in lobby is old, stained and worn out, same for bedspreads in room. I had 2 rooms. Hotel desk in painfully slow as well This is not the hotel to stay at to enjoy a Caribbean vacation, but then again San Juan is not either. Don't stay here, it's a waste of $. Definitely not up to normal Intercontinental standards. The whole area is a dump.

<Content>Another InterContinental Gem My girlfriend and i just returned from a fantastic four day stay at the IC in San Juan.This resort is truly a step above and would recomend it to anyone interested in exceptional service in a first class hotel. The moment you arrive at the entrance the staff is eager to assist in any way you might imagine. Between the six resturants,the casino,the pool(loved the pool bar),the lounges, the spa and workout facility you really didn't have to leave the grounds .

<Content>Great time. My boyfriend and I just came back from a nice trip to San Juan for Valentine's weekend. We both loved it. The Intercontinental was clean, modern, and the staff were very friendly. The hotel food was a bit expensive, but just across the street there is a little shopping center with a grocery store, diner, mexican restaurant, bakery, and baskin robbins, so you don't have to pay the hotel prices the whole trip. The Italian restaurant in the hotel was excellent. The casino is small, but nice for some entertainment. On Sunday afternoons they have a free show of Puerto Rican music and dancing at the pool that I loved. It's a good place to stay if you want a gorgeous pool, easy access to the beach, but a quieter nightlife. You can walk next door to the Wyndam for more nightlife--a dance club, casino, and an amazing lobby with bars and live music. Enjoy!

<Content>Would go back in a heartbeat! Wow! I just logged on to write a glowing review of the InterContinental after our 4 night stay there at the beginning of January, and was shocked to read the reviews from the New Yorkers below! Are they sure they stayed at this hotel? Our experience was completely different. We got a great last minute deal on Travelocity two days before our departure ($680/pp, airfare + hotel!) as we were desperately in need of sun  relaxation (not to mention a quick escape from this brutal Boston winter!) We found it, and so much more, at the InterContinental. I was very reluctant to go to San Juan, as our impressions from a quick cruise stop-over years ago were that it was a dirty and crime-ridden island. Boy am I glad we gave it another shot. SJ is not the type of place where you're going to poke around the village and have dinner in town. But if you want amazing weather, a beautiful hotel, and so good ol' fashioned RR, you found the place. We couldn't have been happier with the IC: a fantastic room (totally spotless, btw), great service, a tranquil and beautiful pool, and one of the best beaches I've ever seen. The sand is like baby powder, and unlike other islands in the Carribean, you're totally undisturbed and encouraged to relax. The restaurants at the IC are great. My husband loved Ruth's Chris and we had an amazing meal at the Italian resto on the lower level. The other nights we went to the Wyndham El San Juan for dinner (they have a great Mexican resto overlooking the ocean) and the Ritz Carlton. We thought the IC was FAR nicer than the El San Juan, and while the Ritz is nice, you pay for it -- and their pool chairs are identical to those at the IC! Their casino was great -- and kept hubby occupied while I read by the pool or napped in our room. Not sure what this NYC reviewer means about the hotel being overrun with New Yorkers. Only days earlier we had moved from Manhattan to Boston, and both found it to be quiet and very laid-back. You could always get a great lounge chair at the pool or a seat in the hot tub. The best part of our trip was breakfasts at the buffet (fresh fruit, omlets  waffles to order, friendly service) and lunch by the pool (salads, sandwiches, great lemonade) brought right to your lounge chair. I'd say we're pretty finicky travellers, and not easily satisfied, but we absolutely loved the IC and thought it earned every one of it's 4 stars. If you can get a great deal online like we did -- GO. We spent our honeymoon at the Four Seasons in Maui and agreed that this little trip was equally relaxing, tropical and enjoyable. I can't say enough good things about this place. My parents just booked a 4-day trip to the IC based on our recommendation. You won't be dissapointed in this place. ENJOY!

<Content>Fear for Life in Puerto Rico Hotel was exellent. Only problem, too many New Yorkers. If you want to escape them, don't go here or to puerto rico in general. But the food, drinks, and casino are awsome. I got carjacked in PR. This island is for the birds. So many other good islands. In puerto rico there were over 700 murders compared to NYC which only had 500. If you go to the IC, don't leave the compound. It is very dangerous.

<Content>YUCK! quite possbily the lamest hotel I have ever stayed at and i am not hard to please: rooms: not worth 360.00 p/night, filthy sheets, smelled like mildew, tiny bathrooms. staff: not friendly and ridiculous enough to add tips(which you are not allowed to do) when they have given horrible service b/c they think you won't help. never was waited on or asked for anything, received very rude responses to everything. room service staff bought 1/2 of one order then the other half 40 mins later b/c they forgot. bell staff was awful-took them 20 mins to hail me a cab and it was deserted. I ended up leaving my daughter on the curb and got one myself. None of the ATM's worked so I have to go into the casino ONLY I have my 4 yr old daughter w/me(yes, i know the rules) so they make me leave her unattended and hysterical so i can run in.The coup de grace? our pay per view wasn't working so we-nicely- asked them to fix it(u need movies when you have a 4 yr old). Not only did they NOT fix it, the jerk who came gave us 4 porn channels(and left an open bottle of lotion near the bed-I KID U NOT) which my kid turned on,(b/c he left the stations on)saw and then freaked out. of course, i am trying to turn it off but since we have 4 I switch on to another. then they swear it has been fixed-we try again more porn. it takes two geniuses to come up there and get them off. My child has had her second bad dream in two days about seeing people be scary with their privates I really hope that someday this will be funny to me but for now. I am pissed. the flippant way they handled everything makes me seethe! bright spots: some good service(front desk staff), good food(but way too much $)

<Content>Nice place, rooms very ordinary We just returned from a 5 night stay, including New Years eve. The best features are the pool area and beach, clean and well kept. The outdoor restaurants and waitress service to your pool chairs was nice and well done. The hotel was relatively quiet, not much to do, except eat and to the casino. However, The Wydham El San Juan is right next door, and a lively place. The rooms were just OK. They seemed on the smallish side, and the bathroom was tight as well. Overall the staff was friendly and attentive. I would look for a hotel with more 'going on the next time.

<Content>Excellent hotel The hotel is very elegant, beautiful, up-to-date modern and very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful, without having to continually tip. While eating breakfast there is a little expensive, it was lovely to sit on the terrace in the morning with the birds. The pool area was kept clean throughout the day, and I could only complain about the children swimming and playing in the jacuzzi (against the posted rules). Lunch between the pool and overlooking the public beach was also a daily treat. The beach was clean and the waves calm, but very full of sand and seaweed, so we kept to the pool. While the hotel is only five minutes from the airport, that also means that there was some muffled noise of planes landing throughout the day and evening. My only complaint was that since it was December, the sun disappeared from the pool area at 3:30 each day, but it was still pleasant enough to stay out until 6 when it got dark. The restaurants at the hotel provide variety, but it was also inexpensive and convenient to get out to local restaurants and the concierge helped with reservations. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Excellent stay Beautiful hotel - grounds are outstanding as well as the service. The free pool area can't be beat with attendants walking around spraying water on the sun beaten tanners. Nice beachside patio bar and grille. Will definitely return this year.

<Content>Excellent--Clean hotel!! Great hotel, staff was wonderful. Hotel very well kept. The grounds around the pool were beautiful. There was no charge for the use of chairs or towels for the beach. There is a fee for umbrella rental. ( previous review said there was a fee for the beach--NOT) Casino was small but I am not a real gambler. Ruth Chris steak house- to die for!!!

<Content>Loved It The hotel was beautiful! The staff was pleasant.The grounds were secure.Beware of the taxes. Hotel tax in PR is high.Isla Verde isn't really near Old San Juan but there is an active night life and the metropol restaurant is affordable and near by.

<Content>Intercontinetal Hotel We just returned from San Juan this past weekend and it was WONDERFUL! The Intercontinental hotel was beautiful and the trip packages for snorkling, the rain forest, ext. that you could purchace at the hotel were awesome. Ruth's Chris Steak house was worth every penny. I can't say enough about how wonderful everything was!! Beautiful beach...beautiful weather....GREAT time!!!
