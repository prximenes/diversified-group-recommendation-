<Content>The best stop-over hotel in DFW! EXTREMELY great location of an upscale hotel, attached to the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. I used this hotel for a layover flight from Miami to Vancouver and booked with a priceline bid of only $69 plus taxes (regular rates are $140 and even higher at times).Rooms are very spacious, have a nice desk for business (Wi-fi is not free-a negative), bathrooms have seperate shower and bathtub.I was concerned about the airport noise, but it wasn't that bad. You can hear some of the closer planes taking off, but they have done as best of a job as they could to insulate for this.Food cost are very high and so is the mini-bar....touch at your own peril!Great well equipped hotel with pool and fitness center. I will stay there again.

<Content>Watch your wallet Our flight was cancelled and we found ourselves stuck at DFW overnight. We were delighted to discover a property so conveniently located on site at the airport. We had a very pleasant stay, our room was comfortable and the location very convenient. In contrast to the positive reaction to the room itself, our interactions with management, after the fact has left us with a negative impression of the HYATT brand.We don't usually stay in chains, preferring to stay in privately owned properties. When I stay somewhere where everything has a pricetag, I feel like I'm walking around with someone's hand in my pocket fondling my wallet. Not a relaxing or welcoming feeling.We were charged for a bottle of water. Not a big deal, $6.00, but we didn't open it or drink it. I DID pick it up to comment to my wife how cheap it feels to have everything with a pricetag. When we contacted the hotel about the charge, It was explained that the bottle is on a sensor and if the sensor is tripped, you get charged. We were assured that the charge was taken care of, then got a further email explaining why we WERE being charged. Our stay has reinforced my impression that chains, such as Hyatt, have lost touch with what it means to be a hotelier. It has reinforced the impression that corporate interests override the ideal of personal attention to one鈥檚 guests and a lackadaisical attitude toward protecting the reputation of one鈥檚 brand. The other reviews here certainly seem to be very positive and I do understand why. If you are accustomed to the chain experience, you will likely enjoy your stay here very much. I'm not quite sure what to think of my reaction but thought I would share it here.

<Content>Could Not Have Been Better I decided to splurge on the Hyatt for my Dallas layover, rather than choosing an off-airport hotel -- and I couldn't have been happier with my decision.This is a beautiful hotel with first-rate service. My corner room was big enough to play tag football, and it was perfectly appointed. The decor, the technology, the gorgeous marble bath with separate tub and shower, and the luxuriously comfortable bed -- it was all simply perfect. I had a wonderful late dinner at the restaurant, with fabulous food and spot-on service. I opted for a room service breakfast, which was as easy as hanging out a door tag by 2:00am. My breakfast was hot when it arrived, exactly what I wanted, and delivered on time with gracious and efficient service.The convenience of grabbing your suitcase off the carousel and just heading up the escalator to the hotel lobby is undeniable - but the proximity is even more appreciated for a morning departure.I got a good rate through Hyatt's website, with a pay in advance discount. For the caliber of this hotel, it was a bargain. I'll welcome the chance to stay there again.

<Content>Very convenient fi flying in and out of DFW We had a schedule layover in Dallas on a return trip home. I had checked rates for several nearby hotels. Grand Hyatt may be a few dollars more, but for us it was well worth it. We arrived in the International terminal, walked into the hotel, checked in, had some appetizers in the M Lounge and slept well that night. All in all it was very convenient and the hotel is very nice.

<Content>This is the perfect airport hotel! This is amazing, we overnighted here both ways on a vacation to Central America, the convenience is great, we arrived at Terminal E and the Terminal Link driver dropped us right at the elevators for the hotel, check in was quick and professional. They had an airport police officer come up and check our ID's and fill out some forms so we could go through security and eat in one of the restaurants in Terminal E. The exercise facility and pool have a wonderful view and the fully stocked lockerroom with steam room was also excellent. 10 minutes after we checked out we had checked our bags and cleared security for our flight. On our return trip, once we cleared customs and rechecked our bags, the escalator up from the customs level exits right where the escalator for the hotel is, so 5 minutes after clearing customs we were checked in and in our room! Room service was good as well, we preordered our breakfast the night before to be delivered at 5 AM, and we got it at 4:55! All airports should have a Grand Hyatt in the terminal.

<Content>Elegant airport stay The hotel, restaurant and bar were modern yet comfortable. The beds were soft and each had a variety of pillows for varied firmness. The bathrooms had showers and soaking tubs. The biggest downfall was no ear plugs in the room. My second night I heard planes quite frequently and could have used something to block the sound. This was a great hotel for business travelers needing to access the outskirts of town. The biggest downfall is having to valet your car as the only other option is to park and take the shuttle in from short-term parking.

<Content>Great Airport Location Higher End Hotel The location was absolutely perfect if you needed to be on the grounds of the terminals at the airport. It doesn't get any better than this. The staff was extremely professional. Ryan the gentleman that checked me in was extremely helpful. The room was very nice and clean. My only issue was that I am a light sleeper and the planes woke me up in the middle of the night and early morning. If you are a light sleeper I would recommend that you stay on the side that doesn't face the runway. I didn't admire the view of planes taking off and if I ever had to go there again I would take a room on the opposite side of the runway. The hotel definitely has a very upscale feel to it. There is a shuttle at the airport run by the Grand Hyatt thake will take you from your terminal to the Grand or the other Hyatt property at the airport.

<Content>Rooms not what you expect I booked a room for the weekend through Hotwire and at the front desk they seemed to have a problem with my reservation not being in their system.I got the impression that they give certain under quality rooms for guests who book through Hotwire/Priceline and such.Although the room I was given was OK..it lacked a dresser for your clothes, a room safe, a minibar and was directly across from the elevator traffic. A coffee pot had to be requested and this one leaked water.Needless to say, I was disappointed as the hotel wasn't full by any means. I like to sometimes stay at hotels in the area where I live to see how your treated given the discount you get through Hotwire. Although the staff was friendly..it didn't make up for the slight of the room.All in all it was a nice hotel, though, but I would choose another hotel to stay at or recommend in the area instead of this one.

<Content>Worth Every Penny Arrived at the doorstep after a cancelled flight.... and they were fantastic!!!!Got me into a great room (up high, overlooking the runway, but it was so quiet you wouldn't know it!). I was lugging an 18month old and 2 bags with no help, and they were quick and kind, and even gave my baby a teddy to entertain him.Room service was great (only fault was that it isn't 24hours) so I had to go downstairs to the 24 hour lounge to get some warm milk at 2am for my baby). Unlike other hotels it was no problem for them to take bottles down to the kitchen and wash them properly. DId I mention they make a great hamburger and have a good kids menu too. As my luggage had been lost they gave me a free toiletries kit.In the morning I had to check out at aout 5:30am for an early flight! When I arrived downstairs they had already checked me in for the flight the night before, but when I arrived downstairs and checked out, they checked me out and advised that my flight was cancelled. They promptly checked me back in and helped me reschedule flights for later in the morning.Yes it is a little expensive, but when you are tired and want a high quality, comfortable hotel, that is part of the airport terminal. Grand Hyatt DFW is your place.Thanks for the great stay.

<Content>DFW Hyatt was a great find We were stranded at DFW with a cancelled flight ten o'clock at night with the airport closing and nowhere to go. Refusing to panic, I remembered being very favorably impressed with the airport Hyatt in San Francisco, so in spite of my airline's attempt to steer me to the Holiday Inn in North Dallas, I called the Hyatt at DFW anyway. I was happy I did. The hotel was beautiful, the room was great, and we enjoyed the bar after we checked in (we needed a good bar after the travel adventure we had just had) and we liked the Mexican breakfast in the hotel restaurant the next morning. All in all, the hotel salvaged a bad travel day and turned it around. We took off the next day for our final destination in a much better state of mind and wallet. They did undercharge for the room since we checked in late--gave us the Holiday Inn price for the Hyatt experience. So if I end up staying at an airport hotel again, I will definitely look for a Hyatt first, if they have one.

<Content>Will always stay here before I fly from DFW I found this hotel when looking for a hotel that offered park and fly from DFW. I chose it becase it was as close as I could get (same terminal) and it was ranked high on trip advisor. I was very happy. Check in was quick. The bell boy that took us to our room showed us where everything was and explained the mini bar to my daughter, telling her it will charge , no you money even if you oped it and look at it, which was cute. The room was clean, beds were comfy, pillows plentiful, and NO outside noise. We ate at the restaurant downstairs. We had snack items (chicken wings and sliders), a salad, kids meal, and 4 or 5 drinks and it was around $100 with the tip. Pool was rooftop and clean. Did not use the gym but I did check it out and it was nice. Locker rooms were great. Received wake up call on time and check out was simple. Received free coffee coupons which were great since flight was at 6 am. The stay at the hotel was a great way to start off a vacation. I was laying out at the pool watching my daughter, thinking.. anytime we fly from DFW, we should come a day early and stay here to make it easier, when...my husband says.. we should walays do this when we fly out from here. So it will be!

<Content>Great Room, good conf facilities This is an on airport property. The only bad thing I could name was that I couldn't take the train to my desired terminal because I had checked luggage and wasn't on american airlines.'As soon as I arrived via shuttle bus from my terminal, bell staff was there to take my bags. (golf bags get me automatic bell service, otherwise I haul them.) They were very responsive, timely, helpful, etc. The bell man even suggested restaurants (unsolicited) and other helpful info.My usual late arrival room service was very good, but pricey. The sunset over the runway/traffic control terminals was very cool. The full moon was equally good. Who could have imagined a room with a view at the airport. (No noise either!)The room was very modern, very clean, and well apportioned. Maid service was good.When I needed to catch the shuttle to terminal e, the bellman/limo driver was extremely helpful. (A cabbie didn't know where one of the better known golf courses or hotels was located the day before.)I'd stay there again!.

<Content>Peace and Quiet My wife and I had an early departure to California and decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt. I had purchased the Park, Sleep, Fly package and it was well worth the money. I was a little worried after arriving that the noise from the departing planes was going to be an issue. I'd have to say that this was the quietest place I think I've ever stayed in my life. The night that we arrived, there just happened to be a terrible thunder and lightening storm that was passing through and my wife and I slept without hearing single peep. The room is very modern with all the up to date electronic devices and gadgets. The bathroom was absolutely amazing and roomy. There was a very large tub, a seperate walk in shower and hamper. The bed was very comfortable and was filled with pillows, I mean lots of comfortable pillows. If you don't want to pay the high costs of room service or pay the ridiculous price of a soda or water out of the fridge, I recommend going to the Grapevine Mills Mall which is close by and provides wonderful restuarants and shopping.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel Beautiful hotel right inside the airport terminal. Our room had a fabulous view of the runway. There is a roof top pool. We stayed here our last night of our trip because we had an early departure the next morning. I wish we had more time to enjoy the hotel, it was really nice. Super convenient for early flights.

<Content>Our Lifesaver This hotel was our lifesaver as American Airlines in it's infinite wisdom, screwed up on our connector flight home (after having screwed up on our connector flight to Cancun from LA). And to top it all off, all of the hotels that they had available for mechanical issues such as these were all booked due to severe weather issues they were also having at the same time. So we had NO CHOICE but to rent a room on our own. My husband and I had been attempting to get home from Cancun and I had a case of Montezuma's Revenge. I had just about had it with traveling for that week. If not for this Hyatt, I may have lost my sanity! They took us immediately, gave us a spectacular rate, and even went so far as to upgrade our room because the gentleman at the check-in counter could see in my eyes how miserable I was feeling. (Very, very nice British gentleman, didn't catch his name, but he went above and beyond!) We were able to get a full and peaceful night's rest and the room itself was BEAUTIFUL. Modern, clean and very well maintained. I was absolutely in love with the room!If I ever get stuck in Dallas again, I wouldn't hesitate one minute to stay here. It was refreshingly wonderful.

<Content>What an airport hotel should be! WOW- I鈥檓 really, really impressed. The hotel lobby is an escalator ride up from the TSA level of this terminal. Very clean, very much new Hyatt style. I鈥檓 Plat with Hyatt, and successfully obtained a runway view room. Hyatt Grand bed, big flat screen tv, and a separate shower and tub- the first time I鈥檝e seen this in a US hotel, although pretty standard in Asia. Room was excellent overall, and didn鈥檛 show the wear and tear I usually expect at an airport property.This hotel had been named as one of the five top airport hotels in the world by the Financial Times, so I was pretty jazzed about seeing it. In brief, it does make the cut.The FT called out both the iPod wine tasting and the tablet menus in the restaurant鈥?so off I went. I ordered the white wine tasting, and they brought over four tastings of white wine, and an iPod (yes, I brought my own earbuds). The wine video, though, was disappointing. It was cursory at best, and the guy in the video could have done so much more with this medium. Cool, but would not repeat.I had dinner in the restaurant which had two neat gadgets. First, the menu was done on a tablet pc, mounted to a standup bracket, which was brought over. However, it didn鈥檛 have prices鈥?so they handed me the standard printed menu鈥?kind of defeats the purpose of the jazzy tech, huh? Also, there were typos in the menu and the tablet. What was cool, though, was the individual flat screen tvs for solo travelers. Nice touch, although the seating area was kind of dark, and a I had to fumble for the channel switches on the tv set.Also, I checked in the gift/deli area for postcards to send to Dad and Kiddo鈥?none there, but the lady at the counter gave me two postcards of the Hyatt, WITH postage already on them鈥?very nice touch.Access heads-up: The entrance to the airport, which includes the high-speed shuttle train, only works if you are flying with AA, or if you have carry-ons only. I was on NWA, and had a suitcase, so couldn鈥檛 get through security. Hyatt drove me to my terminal in a van, but that was a bit annoying. Not Hyatt鈥檚 fault, just bear in mind鈥?br/>Terrific stay, and sets a new standard for airport hotels in the US. I will happily return next time I need an overnight transit at DFW.

<Content>Incredible convenience Due to an early morning flight, I opted for this hotel for the sheer convenience, and it was terrific! After using the check-out kiosk, I took the elevator directly down to the terminal and security checkpoint. Despite the pricey cost of the room, I felt it was well worth it because of the location of the property. I was upgraded to a huge suite at no extra cost. The staff proved to be extremely helpful and went out of their way to make my stay comfortable. The gym on the 9th floor was great! I had 2 issues though: 1) the bed was a little lumpy maybe because it was a Murphy bed? Don't know why I had a Murphy bed in that huge suite, and 2) the bathroom had a weird odor -- could have been the cleaner b/c it was otherwise very clean.

<Content>Great for business meetings I stayed here on business. The room was very quiet; you couldn't hear most of the air traffic, which was quite surprising. The bed was comfy with lots of great pillows. The bathroom was really huge. The food was excellent (though pricey). The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, both personally and in support of our meetings. My only complaint is that internet access cost another $10/day through T-Mobile; for as much as the room costs, I think the internet should be free.

<Content>Great Beds and Quiet This hotel has the greatest beds. They are comfortable and the rooms are quiet. You pay for the location though. We will stay here again if we have to. We love connecting through DFW as this is the easiest airport in the world to get around because of the skylink. This property is tops in my view.

<Content>Excellent Airport Hotel Travelling as a family of eight, we required overnight accomodations enroute to the Carribean. The Grand Hyatt DFW was not only extremely convenient, but accomodated us perfectly. Locating the hotel in the airport was easy; checkin was quick and room configurations were exactly right.The decor is above hotel airport norm. Stylish and contemporary without giving up comfort - even the 18 year olds in the group were comenting how nice the rooms were (and they see some nice hotels!).Not to be missed is the hotel restuarant. We were able to have a late dinner and even though we were the only ones there (it was close to closing time) we never felt rushed or as if we had to get in last call. The menu is varied and interesting - with dishes from all different parts of the world. Again, everyone was happy with the food and especially the service. On our return trip we again stopped in DFW, almost unfortunately for only an hour, as we all would have gone to the Grand Hyatt restuarant to eat, if we had had time.If our travels commanded that an overnighter was the only option (as it is to get from home to the Carribean), we would route ourselves through DFW so that we could again have a fabulous experience at the start of our holidays.P.S. Even though this was during the Christmas holidays, our rate over the internet was amazing! We had four rooms for less than $800.

<Content>Good hotel but airport location can be an issue We stayed at the Grand Hyatt DFW over the Jan 11 - Jan 14 weekend while in town for the Cowboys / Giants playoff game. It was our first visit to Dallas and we chose the airport location to make the arrival and departure legs of the trip easier. DFW is a massive airport and requires some time to get acclimated as the ground transportation system - along with the airport car rental / parking / airport roadways - is quite extensive and can be confusing. The hotel is nice with big, clean rooms and large bathrooms. The view of the runway is cool. We were on the 6th floor and noise was not an issue.We found that food options were limited though. The hotel restaurant is very expensive. You are permitted to access the restaurants located within Terminal D but getting the security clearance card from the hotel (I think done by Dallas PD) and then working through the airport security lines can be very time consuming. And it causes a bit of a stir at airport security when you are without a boarding pass. We went through some extra scrutiny. As to location - we concluded that it would have been better for us to have stayed in downtown Dallas. The drive from the airport to anywhere is long and given that we were only there for the weekend we would have preferred a Downtown location nearer to Dealey Plaza and other attractions.

<Content>Great Airort Hotel I never stay at airport hotels but I will certainly stay at the Hyatt again. This new property is top notch. Great rooms with flat screens and even better bath rooms. Nice bar area, ok-ish restaurant and a great health club...there is even a roof top pool to catch some Texas rays.

<Content>Above and Beyond This is a luxury hotel in the Dallas Fort Worth Airport Terminal D. I stayed here, as it is ranked the #1 hotel in Dallas, but I did not have a flight. It is not too far from the tourist stops if you are staying here for the weekend. I drive between Texas and Oklahoma and am seeking a mid-way point. I think I've found it.The staff working at this hotel are outstanding. The concierge were very attentive and took care of issues quickly. It was my birthday, and a wonderful concierge sent me a small snack of chocolate covered strawberries. It was so lovely to receive, as I was working on my birthday and was without family.The room is large and clean with a great view of the airport landing strips. The bed had 9 pillows. The bathroom has a separate shower and bath. All amenities are included-- slippers, bathrobe, full-size soaps, nice-smelling shampoo, Starbucks coffee, large TV, etc. I have T-mobile for internet, and the hotel did not charge extra. The pool is fantastic and you have a real treat watching the planes take off and land. The gym has several treadmills and high quality gym equipment. You have a view of the airport as you jog. The spa can get busy, and I could not get an appointment on Saturday short notice.Although you are at the airport, it seems the hotel has made an effort to minimize the noise. If you are very sensitive, you should bring earplugs. I had no problems, but some large 747s can come in at all hours. Terminal D was not very busy, and the concierge can provide you with a pass to pick up dinner, etc.I think the regular price for this hotel is typically $200 if you book far enough in advance or have a corporate rate. The value and service for the price I paid is excellent. A lot of reviews have probably been written for this hotel, as it is in the airport. There is a reason why this place is #1 in Dallas鈥?I would say service, cleanliness, location, and attention to detail are the top points.

<Content>Just one night in Sep of 07 Well I thought the rooms were very nice. TBeds are nice, the room has a very nice touch and fell to it. The bathroom is great and a floor to celling window to over look the air field it great. I just sat there watching the plane come and go.Roof top pool is great as well. Also since you stay there they let you into the airport through the check point. Its nice to go into a airport knowing that I dont have the hassle to fl some where. At DFW I like riding the tram thats on top of the airport you get a great view from up there as it goes around.The front desk staff was very nice. I booked online but with AAA and got free breakfest the next day in the dinning room. The food was ok, service was bad. But it was free what can I do, got the tab and saw it was $42, but free didnt care.

<Content>What More Could You Ask For As a frequent traveler through Dallas to other destinations, I've experienced the usual-come-with-the-gig travel snafus. This is now my defacto first call. Even if my luggage made it to the last flight to Vancouver, I know that I can get a ditty bag of essentials (better then any at any other hotel I know of) and can be in the hotel and in my room in 15 minutes. It doesn't get better then that.I *am* disappointed that they've made restaurant adjustments. The sushi bar was outstanding. The food is still outstanding, but I miss the sushi.

<Content>Great Stay at a Grand Hotel Great staff, clean rooms, comfy beds, large bath, separate tub and shower, quality linens, flat screen t.v., robes and yoga mat provided . . . . just to mention a few. This grand hotel is situated in the middle of the DFW Airport and we never heard an airplane in our room! Skylink or shuttle service is available to or from anywhere in the airport. The summer getaway rate included a great Sunday morning breakfast at the hotel restaurant. No routine hotel breakfast here. Order from the breakfast menu. Very attentive service. A coffee and drinks bar is open 24/7. The elevator to rooms is accessed by keycard holding guests only for added security. Be sure to take in the view from the rooftop even if you don't go up there to use the swimming pool or exercise room. It can be fun just to watch the action around the airport! We used the Hyatt after flying to Dallas to begin our vacation through Texas. The Grand Hyatt DFW is a hotel that would please no matter what brings you to the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

<Content>Yeah, It's THAT good... I stayed at the Grand Hyatt DFW with my husband from July 3 till July 7 while we were in town visiting family who lives in Keller, TX. At first I wasn't sure the hotel would be right for the trip I was planning because most of the reviews I read didn't mention anything to do with traveling in and out of the airport during stays. I am so glad we stayed at this hotel because everything good everyone said about it, is definitely true. The bed in the room was one of the most comfy beds I've ever slept in. The gym and pool on the roof were amazing. The flat TV and the iHome were great modern touches. And, for parking, you get a voucher each day to get out of the airport tollgate, it was pretty easy. What a great hotel!

<Content>Great location and service but mattresses need changing Checked in on July 11th for a night after fights to La Guardia were cancelled. Very smooth check-in, great looking hotel with well laid out rooms except the mattress in room 228 sagged to the point of giving the sensation of being pitched downwards. Mentioned it to the front desk on check-out to but the woman merely giggled! All else was very good - excellent room service, convenience to the terminal building including one-time access for emergency shopping for stranded passengers.

<Content>Perfection! I was stranded at DFW due to mechanical-related cancellations, followed by weather delays. AA had booked me a free night at another hotel, but their shuttle wasn't available to pick me up for an hour and a half! The Grand Hyatt was right there, and hey, that's what a Corporate Card is for right?Check in was quick and painless -- they sympathized with my frustration at being stranded and were lovely to work with. I ordered room service immedately upon checking into my room and it arrived literally within minutes! Everything was clean, beautiful, and the food was amazing. Loved it! I'm a Hyatt fan anyways, but this hotel is really wonderful!

<Content>Very impressed with the rooms! I only had a one night stay at this property, but I got a great impression of it during that time.It is easy to get there from any terminal via Skylink. I liked the location in terminal D because it was easy to browse around the shops while on breaks at my meeting.The room was nice, modern, and had a huge bathroom. Unlike the Hyatt I stayed at in San Diego, the tolietries actually smelled nice. The bed was gigantic and comfy.The staff was friendly and accomodating. The pool is tiny but the rooftop location is a great place to watch planes.My only complaint is that room service doesn't last long enough.

<Content>Very Nice! I stayed here regularly for work for about 2 months this year. This is one of the nicest hotels in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. It's really one of the nicest hotels anywhere and the best airport hotel. The rooms are very nice and clean. The amenities are great. The service is first class. The in-room dining is excellent. And the rooms must be well insulated, because I did not ever notice any jet engine noise.The only downside (or upside depending on how you look at it) is: This isn't a trendy hotel, like some in Dallas. So if you want nightlife, you need to drive to it.

<Content>great staY Stayed at grand hyatt may 11-13. Chose hotel based on reviews and it lived up to the hype. The hotel was modern, clean, and the service was excellent. Had a corner room on the seventh floor. The bed was comfortable, flat screen lcd tv was just like mine at home and the bathroom was good size for a standard hotel room. The location was extremely convenient for our 11 o'clock in the morning flight home. Travelled all around texas and the location at the airport didnt bother me at all. The staff was courteous and the valet for 25 dollars a day was worth it. Great hotel for the price.

<Content>Convenient for Travelers This hotel is for those who are travelling in and out of DFW, I could not imagine staying here otherwise. I would not consider this a luxury hotel; it is a lovely respite from the burdens of travel. The hotel and rooms are attractive, modern, clean and quiet. The bed and linens are comfortable, towels fairly thick. The shower head is oddly pointed at the door, so please do not make the mistake of turning on the water without either moving the shower head or getting in first. Also, the size of the shower makes shaving an acrobatic act. The pictures on the website and tripadvisor are accurate and speak fairly for themselves. The staff can be cool. Floor 4 is 1/2 smoking and 1/2 non-smoking, therefore, I recommend non-smokers avoid. Also, watch the rates on the Hyatt website; the rates can fluctuate quite a bit and if you secure a lower rate be sure to request an email confirmation as the hotel does not appear to get the revised rate. Upon each visit I had to show my blackberry to convince the hotel staff that I did indeed negotiate a lower rate. More work for the travel weary. Again, a lovely hotel if you find yourself at DFW.

<Content>Absolutely top notch It is a delight to find a hotel where the level of service is as high as at Grand Hyatt DFW. Prompt, professional, personal are three 鈥淧鈥?that describes it well. The room was tastefully decorated, the bathrooms is large and superb. Choose the rooms on the side that have an airport view -its magnificent. The restaurant serves excellent food. Will definitely stay there again when I come to back to Dallas.

<Content>Hidden Gem at DFW Airport By far the best airport hotel anywhere! I stayed her because my flight got cancelled and the next flight out wasn't until early the next morning. The accommodations here are far better than I would have expected from an airport hotel. The hotel is rate 4 diamond by AAA but the services they deliver are more like 5 diamond. Everything you read on this site is true with the exception of the few negative comments Those people must not travel enough to know good service when they see it. If you are looking for the hidden gem of airport hotels, well you just found it!! One last thing, you can't hear the airplanes but you can get a great view of them from your room.

<Content>Great Airport Hotel Grand Hyatt is very nice - I like airport hotels and this rates one of the best. It is sort of intimate, not as big as you would think in terms of space in the public areas. Staff are very pleasant and go that little further than most.Hotel room was excellent, I love a separate shower and the space is good in both bathroom and room. Beds are very good - almost as comfortable as home. The work station is great - in fact I am typing this loking out from my desk at the Grand Hyatt room and watching American Airlines flight take off. Floor 9 leisue centre also very acceptable. The outside pool was perfect temperature despite the ambient being only a few degrees above freezing. The steam room was excellent and easy to control. Everything is available for you - you only need to ask. Would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Nice addition to Terminal D Stayed here just one night and wished we could have stayed longer. Incredible bathrooms done with black tile. Glassed in separate shower and plenty of towels. Room itself is beautiful, too with lots of modern touches. Large enough to fit the 2 beds, sofa, and glass desk so large two can work at it. Beds very comfortable and soundproofing excellent. No problems with temperature controls. Only one person at check-in, but went pretty smoothly. Hotel is right in Terminal D, but is convenient by train or shuttle bus to the other terminals or the parking lot across the street.Only complaint I have is that the room service food quality was inconsistent. All-in-all a great stay. I shall return!

<Content>Average Hotel I stayed at the Grand Hyatt because it was conveniently located near the airport. I had a friend coming in town for a 3-day weekend. I got lost on the way to the hotel and the clerks were rude and uncaring, they kept telling me they knew where I was, but couldn鈥檛 direct me where to go. When I asked them to plug an address into one of the online maps to get directions for me, they refused. I was shocked and appalled, at the lack of customer service. The hotel is great as far as my guest was concerned. All she had to do was go to her gate since the Hotel is located inside of the airport. The rooms were okay, at best pretty average. The bathroom, from a female's perspective was really nice, I liked the separate shower. The maid service was terrible. The first day we didn鈥檛 need our room cleaned. The second day all they did was turn down the covers, they did not change the sheets. This was extremely disappointing. We had to call them to come back and change the sheets. We felt nickel and dimmed at every turn. They were charging 5 bucks for the water that we could have stopped at a gas station and bought for less than a dollar. It is disappointing to see the hospitality industry moving towards the pay more receive less mentality. I will not stay at the Grand Hyatt again; the service I received was sub par. I will not recommend this hotel to friends. There are other hotels just as close to the Airport that would be a better choice.

<Content>Could be great with a bit of work Almost there. Nice hotel. Good furniture and beds. Nice bathroom amenities. Swanky lobby. OK, now the problems. Getting to the hotel by car is almost impossible. The new Hyatt checkin kiosk is to be avoided for the time being. Hyatt has no idea how to implement them. I did the web check in. Swiped my card upon arrival and the first screen requests your room number. Huh?Second problem occured whenn at 7:30 AM the manager called to ask me if I had checked out. I informed him I had not and he started to explain I had checked out on the TV, Actually, I had not touched the hotel services section of the TV, so...No apology offering. Just allowed me to go back to sleep.Decent minibar but no coffee makers in room.

<Content>Fancy Hotel, missing a few amenities When hubby and I arrived at the DFW airport on our way to a wedding in Colorado, we found all the flights to our destination had been cancelled because of a blizzard. We booked the next flight available -- which wasn't until the next afternoon. And of course we didn't have any luggage. We had a 30-hour layover.We decided to make the best of it and and stay in the Grand Hyatt right there in Terminal D. We called the Hyatt 800 number and made reservations for that afternoon. It was a bit of a splurge, but we figured by the time we paid for cab or shuttle to go somewhere cheaper, it would add up about the same. When we tried to check in, we found out the reservation actually had been made at the other Hyatt at the airport. We asked if we could switch the reservation. The young lady at the reception desk desk tried to talk us out of it, saying the Grand Hyatt was more expensive, etc.. I got the feeling that since we didn't have luggage and were dressed in casual travel clothing, we didn't fit with the rest of the clientele. But our credit card was as good as anyone's and finally she checked us in, giving us a discount for our AAA card. The room was about $200.00 with the discount.The room was very nice, very large with a modern decor. But there was no coffee service. There wasn't even a pen to write with. The remote control on the flatscreen TV didn't work very well.Since we had a lot of time to kill, we took a towncar to a local mall and did some shopping. The towncar driver said the cars were a complimentary service provided by the hotel and cheaper than a cab. Still it was $10 each, one way, plus tip. We paid $50 to drive to an outlet mall to get bargains! But the towncar driver was great, a good conversationalist and he picked us up promptly at the designated time.We had a relaxing stay; a good prelude to a hectic wedding weekend.

<Content>great rooms/food/service but not much close by Stayed at the Grand Hyatt DFW for three nights for a business trip in October 2006. The rooms are luxurious and simple, with comfortable beds, soft sheets, etc. The bathrooms were especially nice and spacious, and the whole place looks very new, or at least newly redecorated. The staff was friendly and accomodating and the food was tasty though portions were small for Dallas. Only cons--it is literally embedded in terminal D of the airport, so it is a hike to find any restaurants nearby. Luckily the onsite restaurant is pretty good, with fresh food/choices. The coffee bar in the lobby was also a lifesaver for those morning when I didn't have time for a full breakfast. Othe con--it takes a while to get used to driving in/out of the city since you have to drive through the airport roads and there is a tollbooth at both the north and south entrances to the airport. Also, you have to deal with the airport traffic. Otherwise, it is a great business hotel.

<Content>Supeb business hotel I only overnighted in this hotel, and I think thats what pretty much all other visitors do. Three best things about this hotel:1. New and greatly furnished: 32in flat screen panel, great bathroom, bed, room, etc. New is always best!2. Excellent front-desk service - extremely polite, fast and accomodating, you could see they were going out of they way.3. It is right in terminal D, so if you are catching an early flight in the morning, there is no travel time to the terminal. If your flight leaves from another terminal, you only have to take the skylink and it all works pretty fast. I dont have much more to say, but I can truly understand why this hotel is currently #1 in Dallas. Recommend wholeheartedly.Forgot to say: I arrived around 10pm and left early morning, so there were not many flights taking off at this time, however on some occasions I could hear the planes roaring - I wonder how it is during the day?

<Content>The Grand is beautiful My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt DFW before our flight to Hawaii. This is a beautiful hotel with wonderful amentities. From the comfortable pillow-top bed to the flat panel TV to the shower and soaking tub...it was all great! Excellent restaurant and bar made for a beautiful evening. I see that a few of the reviews seem to get the Grand Hyatt mixed up with the Hyatt Regency Hotel across the aiport. Believe me, this is the better of the two hotels and is by all means GRAND!

<Content>Loved the Hyatt My husband and I stayed at this hotel before an early flight. We arrived at the hotel and were immediately checked in. Our room overlooked the runway behind the hotel. There was not much noise to speak of from the departing planes, and we actually enjoyed watching the takeoffs and landings of the planes.We went up to the work out facilities and swimming pool on the roof. It was a mild evening, and we were able to enjoy the pool for a bit before it got dark. We both used the steam rooms in the work out changing rooms and really enjoyed it.The beds are heavenly! I was not overly impressed by the flat screen TV. All in all it was a nice room and we had very prompt service for food and beverage ordered before our arrival.I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Definitely NOT a 5-Star hotel After American Airlines left us stranded at DFW, the wife and I walked to the Hyatt. We were cordially checked in and given an overnight kit which included toothpaste and a toothbrush since we had no luggage. But after reading the property description on this website, I need to let guests know that my room differed vastly from the description. First, we were told our bed was a sofabed. OK, if that's the best the Hyatt has to offer I'll take it. It was comfortable, but it's not the pillowtop mattresses as noted in the hotel room amenities description on this site. There was also no minibar nor a safe, and only one of the bathrobes existed. The room had a bottom of the line flatscreen TV with a fair picture. Generally speaking, if you stay here you'll know what brand of TV to avoid. All the missing items I could really care less about, but since Tripadvisor has a hotel amenity link, I need to let consumers know what they might really get. But hey, this gets better. Since our room connected to rooms on either side of us, someone gets in their room and literally plays with the connecting room deadbolt for about 10 minutes. If that isn't annoying enough shortly thereafter someone tries to cardkey into our room. Guessing they couldn't hear the TV, I looked through the peephole and sure enough an older couple was trying to get into the room they were assigned in error. I opened the door and startled them inadvertently. They showed me the room number the front desk had written down and it was ours. The only Hyatt amenity that came in handy was room service. The beer was cold and the breakfast was hot. Fantastic. This Hyatt is not a 5-Star hotel and neither was our stay.

<Content>Another great Hyatt stay! We stayed at the DFW Grand Hyatt for the second time on August 31, as we were flying out of terminal D the following morning. We'd stayed at the Grand Hyatt the night before a flight last year as well (scan back to October for that review), and would do it again.We signed up with the Park and Fly package, which provided parking in the terminal D lot for a week...we wound up paying an extra $32 ($16 x two days) when we left, but knew that ahead of time. We still wound up saving a heck of a lot of money with this plan!Usually we park at The Parking Spot and shuttle in, but are so glad we stayed in an airport lot. Our spot was about 90 seconds from the terminal, which was fabulous when our overnight flight made it into DFW from Hawaii (two hours late, no less) and we had a painless walk from baggage claim to our car.Just like last time, the room was spotless. I don't think there's a bad room in the hotel as the views are all pretty much the same...unless you're stuck next to the stairs or the elevator. We had drinks downstairs and our bartender, Jason, even gave us a sample of the pineapple vodka preserving along the back of the bar. The Grand Hyatt now has an online concierge which will help with special room requests, dinner reservations, etc. We didn't need anything particularly taxing, but I did sign up for extra towels, since we never seem to get enough at any hotel! Imagine my surprise when...the request was actually honored! It was a nice touch...and showed me the Grand Hyatt even takes the little things seriously.The drinks were great, conversation was good, and the room was once again, comfortable and luxurious. We love the bed there...but you can't go wrong with plush linens and a new bed, either! The bathroom is huge (although the tub is small), and I'm a big fan of the huge shower.Check-in was quick and friendly, but we did have a snafu on check-out where they charged us $70 more than our reserved rate. The charge was quickly updated however, and didn't cause us to lose any time.Our only regret is we never stay there long enough to partake in the beautiful fitness facility upstairs but then again, we're local so there's really no reason to stay more than one night.We do highly recommend this hotel...and I'm glad there's finally someplace else to stay on site other than the old, outdated other Hyatt.

<Content>View from a wheelchair in July 2006 In the end we had a great overnight experience, but having booked our handicapped room some 4 months previously, we were shocked to find on arriving from New York that they were overbooked.and had given our room away. They offered us a room with a sofa bed and rollaway cot which we refused.We eventually landed up in an enormous penthouse suite which was sutiable for me and though it was rated at $3500 per night, we were not charged a penny. I think they were seriously embarrassed!The hotel is just beautiful, with a rather unusual dining area - the kitchen being totally open and totally free of cooking smells. The china, glass, cutlery and linens were stunning, the staff helpful and the food delicious. They also had a nice idea for single travellers - a bar to sit at to eat with an individual television to watch at the same time.In the morning we were escorted by a bellman with all our bags directly to check-in - the hotel being part of Terminal D International. Don't confuse this with the Hyatt Regency Hotel which is not the same at all.

<Content>Great! We stayed at the Hyatt for a night due to a layover in Dallas. It was absolutely great. Our flight into Dallas got in around 8pm, and we had an early flight the next morning...thus we couldn't really explore the city of Dallas. The pool and gym are excelent, and are open 24 hours (this is how we passed the time). The beds were very comfortable, there is a flat screen TV, and a nice desk for those that need to get some work done. The bathroom for the rooms are HUGE! They have both a bathtub and a huge walk-in/standing shower and the water pressure is great. One note though, if you do stay here due to a flight connection the next day, and this connection is domestic, you have to take a shuttle to the Domestic terminal, so plan accordingly. We lost our first class tickets because of this oversight. I highly reccomend this hotel due to its location for overnight connecting flights. If you are looking for a hotel and will be vacationing in Dallas, you may want to find a hotel closer to downtown (DFW is quite a distance from downtown). Hope this helps.

<Content>I am very impressed! I really didn't expect this hotel to be all that, but wow, what a surprise. It was really a five-star experience. The food, the rooms, the service - all perfect. I really cannot say enough about this hotel. It isn't an ideal location being right at DFW - but that's the only fault I could find from a tourist perspective - but for a short stay or layover - it can't be beat.

<Content>Luxurious beds I flew into DFW with my 7 y.o. with hopes of arriving before 9p.m. Flight delayed and didn't get it all together till close to 11:30 p.m. My flight arrived at a terminal which requires transportation to the hotel, you can see the Grand Hyatt, just can't get there easily; called the G.Hyatt and was told where to wait for the shuttle. Well, 20 minutes later I called from my cell phone and spoke with the manager who apologized profusely and drove the shuttle himself to pick us up. He was extremely professional, kind and went over the top to help me and my daughter get settled. Also gave me 3 free breakfasts of our choice the following morning as my sister was meeting me at the hotel. The beds are to die for, the rooms quiet (try to opt for a lower floor, as I found airplane engine noise louder the higher you go), and the pool deck and exercise room a must; it worked out beautifully for us as my daughter is full of energy and spent the morning after breakfast swimming. You really don't believe you're in DFW airport especially with the very Euro bar, restaurant and coffee bar. Great illy coffee!!!

<Content>What a perfect hotel! My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt DFW for our wedding night and I could not have asked for a better place to stay for that night. The hotel opened a year ago, so everything is brand new and very modern. The beds are very comfortable, there is a desk for any work that needs to be done in the room if you are there on business, the tv's are flat plasmas by Samsung. Out the windows are the runways where you can watch planes land and take off right in front of you (incase you're one of those types like me). The hotel is right in the middle of the new Terminal D, which just opened 3 or 4 months ago.This is especially great if you are flying out of Terminal D, you can just go downstairs, check in, go through security and you're there. Valet parking is $16 USD, but may be worh it. Check in was quick and got exactly what I asked for, a high, non-smoking, corner room. The workout facilities are awesome and the pool is on the top of the building. The bathroom is the largest hotel room bathroom I've experienced... It has a seperate good sized shower, a tub that is not quite a garden sized tub but still a nice sized tub, and the bathrooms floor and some of it's walls is black marble tile. This room has a safe (i think), quality robes and a nice size closet too. The restaurant is really pricey. I would suggest going outside the airports property if you can to eat meals because there are a lot of great places to eat just on the otherside of those toll booths. If you need to get your car out of valet, just call valet before you leave the room and it will beready for you when you get down stairs. Whenever you call the valet, front desk, etc... they greet you over the phone by name. Good evening Mr. ____ . How may I help you?, which is kind of nice. Oh... the other thing that is great about this place, online I got this hotel for $115. + taxes. Compared to other places that are comparable to this hotel in quality, this was half the price. I was extremely pleased with my stay here.

<Content>Not Your Regular Airport Hotel I had the pleasure of staying at this amazing hotel on June 7 for business. I travel extensively so I am rather critical of hotels. Every part of my experience at this hotel was outstanding. Check-in took a matter of seconds. The entire staff is extremely professional and knowledgable. The hotel is just coming on its first anniversary so everything is new and modern but, more importantly, the rooms are immaculate (I am a major clean freak so this is of primary importance to me). I look forward to my next trip to Dallas just to stay here again!

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful This hotel was awesome. My wife and I spent the first night of our honeymoon there and loved it. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Since the hotel is located in terminal D of DFW the bellman took our baggage to check in for us and saved us the trouble. From Terminal D you can check in and then board the sky link to your terminal. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>(almost) worth leaving the Carribean We chose this hotel because of the convenience for an overnite lay-over on our way home from St. Martin. We were thrilled with the Alamanda Resort for our vacation, and the Grand was a perfect dessert after a feast!We checked in after midnight and had to catch a 9 AM flight. The bed was the best and most comfortable since home, the bath was perfectly appointed and the check-in, check-out and breakfast in the restaurant were stellar examples of service. The window overlooked a runway, but we never heard any noise. The room, booked through the Hyatt website, was $115 a night, $128, with tax!If there had been a coffee maker in the room, it would have been perfect.

<Content>Best Hotel Stay of the Year This overnight stay at DFW was a complete shock and surprise to me. I am in the hotel industry and usually stay at 4+ * hotels. I had to overnight at DFW and chose the Grand Hyatt out of convenience (near Concourse D). This hotel exceeded ALL my expectations in every department. Check in is similar to going to a botique small hotel. Room was EXCELLENT, well appointed, comfortable. Same for bathroom and amenities. Room service was prompt, efficient, and food was very well prepared and presented. Staff were friendly, professional and helpful. Health club facilities for working out were over the top -- best of any hotel I have been to or worked for in the last several years. All in all a 5 star experience. I would look for an excuse to stay there in the future.
