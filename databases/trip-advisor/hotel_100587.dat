<Content>Not sure Old building, remodeled, and it shows. Sleeping room was relatively small. Stand-alone closet with short space for hanging garments. No sitting chairs, just a weird desk chair that did not elevate. Heating system is a window AC unit that has to be shut off at night or guests will roast. Tiny bathroom with small glass shelf above tiny stainless steel railroad car sink. Gap between the shelf and wall that allows small items to drop to the floor. Toilet is undersized round bowl. And toilet paper holder mounted to block a person's leg. Bed was awful, saggy thing. Nice lobby with uncomfortably low furniture. Interesting blow up artsy photos on all doors. Appearance like discount W. Convenient to US Court House (across the street). Convenient to shopping area. Our weekend price was reasonably low. One night is about all we could take. Next time, a different choice, I am sure. Most pleasant memory is gull that sat on the window sill, begging through the glass for food.

<Content>Great time at Max I looked online, but didn't find a better rate than the hotel's site, and when there's a problem, orbitz is nowhere to be found, know what I mean?Anyway, it's a clean, comfortable hotel with interesting surroundings, and amenities that you actually might want when traveling, like a 24 hour place to eat a block away and check service for your luggage after checkout. The artwork it's famous for is funky and fun, if not life-changing, and the rooms are very functional, if a little small. The beds are comfortable, the linens are decent and the service was great (inlcuding bellhops that actually earn their tips). Close to downtown and pike place don't hurt, either. For $140 for a king room it was well worth it.

<Content>Excellent stay for the price! My husband and I live in Portland, OR and frequently travel to Seattle as a weekend getaway. We have stayed an numerous hotels, and I would venture to say that the Hotel Max is definitely the best deal for the money. We bought the all-inclusive package for 1 night plus free valet parking  breakfast voucher and everything was excellent. The hotel is very artistically decorated and is every bit as unique  modern as they boast on their website. The beds are amazingly comfortable  the room was very clean. We went with the Artist King Room, and had plenty of space. If you are looking for a downtown Seattle hotel with basic amenities, swanky decor, a great bar  restuarant and want to stay away from mobs of parents and kids looking for the pool  buffet, this is your place.

<Content>strange start but good after that I read the reviews on this website before booking and knew what to expect. Good price, hotel located close to everything, nude picture as you walk in (who cares, get over it!).King artist room was small but still ok for the one night. Bathroom is small, but if you use it one at a time there will be no issue.Checkout was easy.Checkin was the weird experience. There was a couple in front of us as we walked in. The guy behind the desk was in the final stages of explaining to them about the restaurant next door, what floor they were on, that you had to use you room key in the elevator, what time checkout is etc.All good. We then approach the desk, credit card etc, finds reservation, all good.Then he hands us our room key and says is there anything else i can do for your stay in Seattle? We both look at each other confused and then he says oh but you didnt hear what i was saying to the other couple?  NOOOOO we didnt. We actually did but just beacuse we were in earshot, doesnt mean that we are not worthy of receiving information about checkout, what floor we are on, the restaurant etcI would have to say the hotel was great but its the little things that sour the taste.

<Content>Fantastic little gem! Affordable, stylish, comfortable, clean, and oh, did I say affordable? Great location -- within walking distance of many sightseeing spots. I highly recommend this hotel! One caveat -- I live in Manhattan where hotels cost $400 a night and 8' x 10' rooms are considered decently sized.

<Content>Mixed experience I travel frequently for work and pleasure, and found Hotel Max to be a mixed experience.My reservation was in order when I arrived, but despite calling twice and making sure that incidentals were cleared from the room and a hold wouldn't be put on the credit card I put down, on arrival I was told that's not possible.Reasonably, I put a credit card down and they placed the hold. However, two hours later when I was resting in the room cleaning staff came in and emptied out all incidentals. So, now I didn't have anything in the room and the charge was on my card.The room itself was crowded and VERY small (compared to similar boutiques in San Francisco) with a knob window heater (opposed to a digital one that moderates the temperature). I'm native to Minnesota so found Seattle to be fairly temperate in comparison so this wasn't a huge deal, but might be a a factor for someone coming from a warmer climate-- or someone that doesn't want to wake up roasting/freezing.Eventually the room felt more cozy instead of cramped, but it did take some getting used to. The decor is entertaining.There were multiple occasions in the three days I was there that my room became very smoky, likely from a nearby smoking room. Opening the window solved the problem. I could also hear my neighbors talking normally in the other room.On the positive side, the art on the doorways in stunning and the hotel certainly has personality. The front desk was friendly, knowledgeable and competent. They have a free business center with high speed internet and printers. Their location is prime for walking to most parts of the city.Typically, there's a two minute wait for a cab (they have to call one). HOWEVER, if you walk uphill a block to the Westin there's a whole line of available cabs to take.If you're looking for somewhere to crash for the night, this is a great choice. However, if you're looking for someone to spend some time at, there are probably better choices available for the money.

<Content>A bit of a shock but a good stay The Hotel Max is an art hotel so just a warning, there is a life-sized nude woman right when you walk in the lobby. We had our 7 year old with us and weren't quite prepared but thankfully, we're also not squeamish about nudity and we just told her it was art and that nudity is nothing to be ashamed of. Lucky for us, she was mature about it too.Beyond that, the rooms are very small but that is normal I think for city hotels. The hotel staff was friendly, the rooms were clean and comfortable. The big flat screen TVs were a nice surprise. The Pike Place Market is about a 10 minute walk, as is the Space Needle and most major points downtown. We had a great stay and the price was good too. I would recommend this hotel to people traveling to Seattle.

<Content>Comfortable, convenient, chic We stayed at your sister hotel in Tacoma,The Hotel Murano and were so impressed with decor, staff, location that we decided to try the Max.It is so close to everything in downtown, and yet easy to get to other destinations. The room was a bit small, but very comfortable and for the price, exceded our needs. Look forward to doing some downtown Christmas shopping and staying so close to the shops.We are looking forward to having dinner at the Sushi restaurant, the menu was impressive.

<Content>Hotel Max Exceeded Expectations My girlfriend and I are University students from Vancouver and wanted to getaway for a couple of days in Seattle. We were looking to stay at a good-quality, reasonable and comfortable hotel in downtown Seattle near Pike Place market. With Hotel Max, we got exactly that. We went online 3 weeks before our trip which allowed us to book for 2 nights at a reasonable price of $139 per night. The artwork at Hotel Max is very unique and nothing like I have seen before. Even though I know nothing about art, I found that the artwork really suits the vibe of the hotel as it appears to cater to a younger crowd.The room was comfortable and has everything you need including a good-sized shower and a wide-screen TV. I loved how we could choose our own pillows and have them brought up to us. Overall, a highly recommended hotel that I will stay at again the next time I visit Seattle.

<Content>Modern Look Very small scale hotel. Everything in this hotel is small , especially the bathroom, and a shower. However, the room is clean and comfortable. A great location of downtown for the price compared to the major chain hotels in the area. Check in is very fast. Hotel staffs are friendly and courteous. A street noise can be a bit annoying. I like the modern and contempory look of the hotel.

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel - Loved It! I stayed at Hotel Max for a week during a business trip to Seattle. I really enjoyed my stay - the service was REALLY good and everyone was very friendly. Whenever I asked for anything, I got it in 15 minutes or less. The hotel is artsy and fun, a vast improvement over the generic mega-chains available nearby for 2x the price. My room was smaller but perfectly adequate, the decor was contemporary and I LOVED the bed - excellent quality on par with the Westin 'heavenly' bed. Location was also excellent - just around the corner from the retail core and walking distance to any of the major tourist attractions in downtown Seattle. Really a great deal for downtown Seattle.

<Content>Excellent Hotel with a Personal Touch We stayed for the first time in Seattle for our Anniversary. As soon as we checked in the staff knew exactly who we were, wished us both a Happy Anniversary and checked us in to our room early without issue. When we arrived to our room (with an excellent view), we were treated to a free bottle of Wine, Chocolates, and a Handwritten Congratulatory Note for our special occasion!The rest of our stay continued to be very pleasant and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Seattle.The only drawbacks is the overall accommodations are on the small side (elevators are tiny) and the lack of free wireless. You can pay for wireless by the day or use the complimentary Internet in the business center behind the lobby though.

<Content>Artful ambience An enjoyable place to stay, centrally located and within walking distance of many Seattle sights. I recommend a walk to view the door art starting at the top floor and taking the stairs down each floor. How wonderful for a hotel to support and display so many Washington artists. The restaurant was excellent and the staff was most accommodating and friendly.

<Content>Modern and Artsy We booked the Hotel Max for a weekend getaway. We chose this hotel because there was a Travelzoo deal where the Queen of Art room was $139.00/night - This was a pretty good deal, compared to over $200.00/night for other hotels in the area. Parking was very steep at $30.00/night, so we opted to park in the office building across the street. For those that don't mind leaving their car outdoors overnight, there was an open-air parking lot that seemed more economical.The room itself was a bit small, but there were only two of us and we only had an overnight bag. If you have more luggage than one large suitcase, you might not want to stay there. It feels like staying in a guest room at a friend's place, rather than staying in a hotel room. Our room had a nice view of the courhouse.The LCD TV was nice, as was the Aveda toiletries. Terrible coffee, but decent tea. The bed was extremely comfortable, but the sheets were a bit scratchy. Although we didn't take advantage, there was a neat pillow menu and a spiritual menu. The location of the hotel was decent. We were within walking distance of downtown attractions and the Pike Place market. It is also about 2 blocks from the Greyhound station.Would I stay at this hotel again? Yes, if it was around $100.00 per night. Any more and I would choose to stay elsewhere..

<Content>Just right We stayed at Hotel Max for five nights and I can't think of a single thing really wrong with the place. Sure the room was smaller than usual, but who cares. It more than made up for it in quality, and besides you don't stay in your hotel room the whole time. The staff there were extremely friendly and helpful. Often times they would go out of their way to make sure we were taken care of and if we had any questions. We dined in the restaurant once, and it was excellent. The wait staff was friendly and the sushi was prepared well. We could never hear out neighbors in the adjoining rooms, and the street noise wasn't bad at all from the 6th floor. Yes, the snacks and drinks they provide in the room are expensive. We ended up getting our own drinks and fresh fruit from Pike's to fill the fridge instead. We took a towncar to and from the airport, and it was worth the convenience ($38 one way). Also, if you can plan ahead don't bother renting a car and taking it to the hotel. If you can plan far ahead enough in advance there is a zip car right across the street and others only a couple of blocks away.I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Stay at the Max I stayed at the Hotel Max with my mother for one night while visiting Seattle. Overall we had a great experience. The rooms are very well appointed, although we did notice that the room and hallways smelled a bit of stale cigarette smoke, even though the property is completely non-smoking. The staff at the Max were most helpful and very accommodating. They had great suggestions and were friendly and genuine. The hotel is very well located, within walking distance to everything downtown Seattle has to offer. We booked a package rate that included parking and breakfast in the adjacent restaurant. It was worth including parking in the rate, but I would not recommend the restaurant for breakfast.

<Content>A perfectly located boutique hotel The Hotel Max is literally a block away from the Nordstrom department store and the main shopping area.It's a nicely designed boutique hotel with a comfortable bed, good staff and a fantastic restaurant which has happy hour for food  drink between 4-6pm. It's really worth eating here....The only negatives are that you can't get free wireless internet (for that you have to go to Starbucks which is almost next door) and that the rooms and bathroom were tiny - in fact they were New York size.If you like sleeping with your window open make sure that you're on one of the top floors at the back of the building as the hotel is on a major through street.

<Content>Wonderful "boutique" Hotel Wonderful experience, the staff will attend to most any request. Loved the artwork found through out the hotel, even each room door! Good location, you can walk to Pikes Market and many other fun Seattle locations. We paid $179 per night plus tax.The pillow menu was a nice feature along with AVEDA bath products.The RedFin restaurant serving Hotel Max was excellent. The room was supplied with wine glasses and a cork screw along with other personal items,.We strongly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved the Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Max on two occasions prior to our cruise to Aaska, and after. The rooms were small due to the fact it was converted from an old building,staying for a week may be a bit challenging, but quite adequate for a few days. Ths staff was great, told us of all the sights to see and how to get around Seattle. The area was great, restaurant next door and room service. Walking distance to Pikes Market and all the shopping you would want. The monorail is only two blocks from the Hotel and takes you to the Space Needle, park, science center and music hall. Upon checking out and getting to the airport we realized we had left some things in the room. When we got back to California I called the hotel and they put me in touch with their houskeeping supervisor. She informed me the housekeepers had not finished the rooms but would get back to me, she called within 5 mins. and had found the items. They were mailed immediately and we received them within two days. Kudos to all the staff. I surely would stay again and recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Seattle.

<Content>Friendly, quirky and great location Rooms are nice but small. If you are a couple with a lot of luggage, you will be wondering where to put it with just 2 drawers and a narrow wardrobe in our Queen room.That said the staff were always friendly and helpful. The quirky object in the mini bar cupboard gave me an hilarious taking point at the conference I was attending at the Westin nearby.Easy walk to the shops, Pike Place market etc a real plus.

<Content>would stay here again As many other reviewers have stated, the room is quite small, but the design is fresh  hip!! The location within the city could not be better! Staff was very friendly  helpful. One negative is that all available space w/in the room was taken up by the mini-fridge  the very expensive snacks - would've been nice to have a little storage instead as we stayed 3 nights. The beds were comfy and the rooms/bathrooms were very clean. Shower was in a separate room, which was also quite small, but a great shower with quality fixtures/finishes! Made it nice for 2 people trying to get ready at the same time 'cuz there's no way 2 people would fit in the bathroom!! We'd def. stay there again!!

<Content>I will visit Seattle again just to stay at the Max! I stayed at the Max in April 08 even after hearing some reviews about it being too small. In my opinion, size did not matter because the second you touched that bed you were out cold due to the comfort. There is even a pillow menu! The decor was awesome, and the restaurant downstairs was beyond expectations, including the room service. Plus, my room was reasonably priced and the hotel is within walking distance of the market and lots more.

<Content>Hotel Max was excellent My wife and I stayed at Hotel Max in August 2008, for 2 nights. We enjoyed the very modern fittings in the bathroom , the art work on the walls and room doors, the excellent service, the carded gym facility, and the clean hallways.The service at the reception desk was helpful and friendly. The location ,a short walk to downtown and Pike Place market , made the hotel a good choice.

<Content>Truly unique character and a great location at a reasonable price Hotel Max was an excellent choice for our recent three night stay in Seattle because of its central location and affordable rates. The modern/contemporary and artistic design was a draw for us, setting it apart from the traditional hotels in the immediate area. We wanted a reasonably priced hotel with character and class as an alternative to the simplicity and lack of style generally found in some budget hotels. Location was great. It was a quick walk from the hotel to Pike Place Market and only two blocks from the mall and shopping on 4th and 5th avenues. Our only criticism, which I was aware of from reading other reviews before our trip, is that the rooms and bathrooms were very small. They are unique and interesting but probably not a good choice for someone who is accustom to the design and layout of a conventional luxury hotel. Overall, for us, a couple in our early 30s who wanted a nice, unique hotel but didn't want to spend $300/night Hotel Max was a good choice.As a side note: We had two excellent meals while in Seattle. One was at the Icon Grill on 5th Ave where they have 1/2 price bottles of Washington wine on Wednesday nights. The meal was delicious, wine was excellent and the service was fantastic (ask for Lindsey B.). The restaurant's tables were entirely booked with reservations but we easily got a seat in the 鈥渇irst come, first serve鈥?lounge area. Our second great meal was a sit down breakfast at Bacco on Pine Street, just a block up from Pike Place Market. The have great Belgian waffles and omelets with a nice outdoor seating area for people watching if the weather is nice.

<Content>Small but very nice. The decor was nice, but there was not much space in the room or bathroom. Overall though, I liked the place. The staff was really polite and helpful. The location was really nice if you were in Seattle to shop. It's right in the middle of it all and only a 10 minute walk to Pikes. Even though it was a little small, I would stay there again.

<Content>A Hotel with a Character We stayed here two nights in Aug with some friends from London and the hotel provides to us what we wanted: very well located in the down-town area, friendly staff, and fantastic restaurant /bar in the hotel. If you are looking for a hotel with a character and closed to bar/restaurant and the tourist attraction in Seattle. This is for you.

<Content>Doggish in Seattle We travel to Seattle several times a year. Generally we are viewing welcome new additions to the family. A doggish addition to OUR family prompted a new direction in hotel accomodations...the search for pet friendly hotels. The Hotel Max, a cutting edge, Euro-funk addition to the Seattle hotel roster would not have been my first choice. Our son puts his business clients up there and he made the choice. Grandpa, grandma, nine year old Isabella and 12 pound Octavia all found the staff to be pleasant and accomodating. Isabella particularly found the room keys with the naked mannikins enchanting and I am sure they will be a hit with the 4th grade in Mesa AZ. I know she pocketed them as a souvineer. Pros: Excellent location, superb beds, great pillows,accomodating staff and very friendly ambience. The car was always there when requested..Semi-clever art and a good restaurant for breakfast. Cons: very small rooms, awkward and unsafe bathrooms. noisy with poor soundproofing. Extremely dark hallways. The cleaning staff is hit and miss and over a 4 night stay, the bathroom and dusting were sporadic in nature. Not quite clean but no filth...perhaps a bit of Euro-grunge. Dog amenities were delivered in a sporadic fashion also. Petrified dog treats which were decline by five different pooches. (We offered them around thinking Octavia was being picky and got no takers.) It is a toss up whether we would stay there again if it were not for the dog and the corporate rate. I have found better deals. Everyone is very nice, but it isn't a great bang for the buck.

<Content>etrocalgary This is not a contemporary or funky hotel, this is just a cheap dump. Don't be fooled by a meagre display of so called contemporary decorating.The building is very old with tiny tiny rooms and bathrooms. The rooms stunk of damp,mildew and really old wood. If there weren't new beds in the rooms, you'd think you were in the Bates Motel. The bathroom was decorated with a small bowl sink, but they left in the original tubs, yuk. All the fixtures are inexpensive, no art work, flat screen wasn't mounted to the wall, but the bedding was good. There is no where to open your luggage, you can barely walk around the bed. The elevator is a lift, fitting just 2-3 people, after long waits. The halls to the rooms are scarey, all dark and very narrow. There was not one impressive area in this whole hotel. Clearly this hotel has only had cheap cosmetic decoration to slip it into a 3 star categary, but it's still a dump.( putting Avedia products in the bathroom doesn't make up for the smell or the size) The decor and room size is comparable to a hostel, not a 3 star hotel. I strongly recommend paying a bit more and staying somewhere else, there are lots of other options around. A night or two at the Hotel Max could ruin your vacation.

<Content>Lukewarm Experience My husband and I recently stayed at the Hotel Max for an anniversary weekend. The decor was fun and funky. Our room was spacious and comfortable, but there was a step up into the bathroom which would make it impossible for a disabled person (and dangerous in the middle of the night if you forgot it was there). We asked to be moved after the first night as the air conditioner seemed to have only one speed and was quite loud. The next room was a bit of an odd layout, but ok.I had made a video of our years together and saved it to my iPod. The TV monitor would not accept any auxiliary output, even though the monitor itself was set up for it. When I called the front desk they said it was set up that way so that they could make money on Pay per View. There was nothing they could do about it and that's just the way it is.The hotel is conveniently located, but the $30/night parking charge seemed high. Overall the experience was okay, but I would probably not opt to stay there again.

Loved the styling and use of quality building materials... The parking was a little expensive but you're in down town Seattle (what do you expect)... Again, great art, great style and a very unique experience...

<Content>Perfect for Lilliputians I was in Seattle for a conference in June and spent three nights here. The room was a double, ie, two beds and I was travelling with my spouse. There was not enough room for us to unpack anything and so little floor space that I could not leave my suitcase filled and accessible (not even under the bed). I contacted the front desk for additional hangers so that I could at least hang my things. I'm a light packer but was completely stymied by the inability to put my things away. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever used. The stall shower was not large enough to bend elbows much less shave legs, etc. Plus, the shower curtain was black and so there was no light in the stall. Sink was like an airplane sink. Ridiculously small. Do not attempt to wash your face using such a fixture. Plus it was in your lap when you sat down on the toilet. Staff was friendly and courteous but nothing could compensate for the size of the facilities. Great location, comfortable beds but I will never go back.

<Content>noisy with attitude While it's a trendy hotel, it is lacking in a number of areas. The first room we were in was large, but the step up to the bathroom measured 10. And, the ceiling was that much lower than normal, so my 6'4 body felt squished.We checked in late, after seeing a play, and the room was quite warm. So I turned on the window shaker, (yes, that's all they have), and while it worked well for cooling, there is only one fan speed - loud and high. Trying to get some sleep was difficult, and when I turned it off about 3am and opened the window, the traffic noise, buses and police sirens were worse.They fixed the fan, as there were some additional noises, but then told us that's the only speed. We moved to another room that would be quieter, but it was only nominally so, and much smaller.The front desk didn't seem truly committed to resolving the issue. Then at checkout, we learned that they had charged us $30 a park our car, which we never moved, while we could have parked ourselves in the same garage for $12 a day.The tv was intentionally set to refuse our iPod plugin, as we wanted to watch a show my wife had built showing our previous 28 anniversaries. They were much more interested in selling us adult movies - I guess to go along with the unpriced optional equipment in the room, a vibrator. But they did offer 7 versions of Spiritual books, like the Bible, Koran and such. How touching.

<Content>Great location we stayed here two nights in Aug. and found it to be a great location, and nice hotel. The rooms were a bit small, and the bathroom was very small. No bath, just a shower. Other than that, there was nothing to complain about. Clean, and funky decor. We walked everywhere downtown, the location is perfect for someone who wants to see the Seattle hot spots. We got a great deal at travelzoo.com, not sure what the normal rates are.

<Content>Cool Lookig Hotel The Hotel has great decor wihich is funky young and upbeat. I would give it 10 for styling. Great location close walking to all the sights. Staff was less desirable. I drove to the hotel and decided to use the valet parking for $30 dollars a night, this worked great. Typicaly hotels will have a bell boy to help there clients, no one was there to great us, or help us with our luggage. Went to check in... not even a hello Do you have ID was the opening line, sorry guy's but this is not customs. I had high hopes for this hotel but I gave it an average rating do to the average care that I was give while stayng there.

<Content>Can't wait to stay there again!!!! What a great experience I had at the Hotel Max! The moment you walk in the hotel you are greeted by happy folks and it just continues everywhere you go. I loved the pillow menu! It is a great way to try out all of those different pillows you have been wondering about. The art work is so much fun and we went to every floor just to see the art on the doors. There is a different theme for each floor. The view from our room was great and just made you feel like you are a part of a beautiful city!! I know sometimes famous people stay there but I didn't see any during that visit. I just can't wait to go again!

<Content>Very nice stay I recently went to Seattle to meet up with some friends. We wanted to stay downtown and none of us were familiar with the city. We settled on the Max based on reviews and availability. It was a great choice for us. The location is really great, near everything. The staff is most helpful and informed we found. Yes, our room was small. It was also well appointed. The mini bar is a small frig which was easy to use for our stuff. The beds and bedding are first rate. The bathroom had a great tub, something I love! One thing I found odd is the windows were not sound proofed. It is city hotel with city street noise even on the 6th floor. The windows do open for fresh air. I loved the original art and the hallways. They are dark but not unpleasant. One evening we ate at the Red Fin, the restaurant within the hotel and enjoyed it. I would stay again.

<Content>Stylish, cool and comfortable boutique hotel Great hotel. We stayed one night - and not all hotels will accept a one night Saturday booking. The booking was straight forward, and cost very reasonable, and the hotel is very well situated for downtown Seattle. The valet parking is efficient and costs comparable with surrounding car parks. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful at all times, and the overall style of the hotel is very cool and uber-stylish. Although not a family hotel, our teenage children loved it - but you might have to explain what the intimacy kit and battery driven device available for purchase in the room are for... The rooms were of reasonable size, and the furnishings, bedding and fittings are to a high standard. I would not hesitate to recommend Hotel Max if you want a high style, boutique hotel at reasonable cost in downtown Seattle.

<Content>an over-priced flophouse I was stunned to walk into the hotel and see the nude photo right in front of me, and then a semi-phallic wallhanging to the left. The staff was pleasant, however. The elevator was barely big enough for 2 people with suitcases, and my heart sank when the door opened on the 3rd floor...8-foot ceilings, NARROW corridor, dark walls, and bizarre photo prints of some of Seattle's oddest citizens adorning each of the room doors. Our corner room with 2 double beds was extremely small, and faced the Federal Courthouse. I was dismayed to see a window air-conditioning unit instead of a more modern central air system. In order to sleep at night, we had to turn the unit on to block the street noises, but the airconditioner was so loud, even on the lowest setting, that my daughter had trouble sleeping. The bathroom had the tiniest sink I have ever seen - even smaller than the bar sink in my home! I had to contort myself to get down low enough to splash my face. The bathtub was clogged, and I had to get tell the hotel staff to fix it . They did so promptly. I was tempted to switch hotels, but the hassle factor was too great, so my daughter and I spent 2 nights at the Hotel Max, which is really a glorified flophouse despite the high price of rooms. The only good thing about this hotel is the location...6 blocks to Pike Place Market, 1 block to Nordstrom, plenty of coffee shops, etc. I would not stay here again unless the room prices were reduced to $150 a night.

<Content>Very Average We have just gotten back from a 3 night stay at the hotel max after going to Seattle for a friends wedding. The hotel was average at best.. the Queen room was very small with not much room to get around the bed and a very tiny bathroom. The main gripe we had about the hotel was the noise, we were up on the 6th floor, however the traffic noise was still pretty bad and we were woken up at 4:30 the one morning with the aircon above dripping water on our aircon unit (think big raindrops on a tin roof). The airon itself sounds like a industrial fan and given that you can't open windows due to traffic noise doesn't help induce a peaceful nights sleep.the WIFI internet at the hotel is a complete rip-off ($12 for 24hrs) and given that there is free internet in the 'business centre' downstairs I don't see why they can't just throw this in with the room price which isn't exactly a bargain.Good points: The hotel was very clean when we stayed there and they were helpful enough to bring up some headache pills after I came down with food poisoning. The location is also pretty central with decent shops around 5 mins away.If you're stuck for a hotel at a decent(ish) price this isn't bad but do some research as my friend who got married stayed at the Andra hotel and his room looked ALOT nicer.

<Content>not my first choice for a return visit While it may be Seattle quirky, it was a little too expensive for what you got, in my opinion. If you're really into style  art - this may, however be the hotel for you. Rooms were TINY. Not even room to open my suitcase on the floor. Bathroom had nice style, but hard to find room to leave toiletries in the bathroom. Bed was nice, however, and the TV was a large LCD. Not a bad place to stay (unless you're a prude - the art work was somewhat risky), but it won't be top of the list the next time I come.

<Content>Artsy, but overpriced Small room, small elevator, and I think robots work the front desk. Upon checking out the fella asked me, 'How was your stay?' I answered, Fine. Less than a minute later, he asked me the exact same question again! I know you've got to act like you care when it comes to customer service, but come on. At least listen to the answer of your question or just don't ask it.King size bed was nice, but I had to roll over the bed to get to other side of the room. Even though it's an older building I think the management could put the appropriate size bed in proportion to the room's size. Also no free WiFi. They charge you for that. You can go to their business center for free, but who wants to stand in line for a community computer in this wireless age?Interesting art throughout and the complimentary CD (single) was an indie artist which I dig, but I was too scared to assume it was free given bottled water was $6.00 each.

<Content>Boutique it is not We booked lured by TZOO top 20 dealThe location is great - close to everything. The staff is young and hip but is not very experienced. The decor is memorable and stylish. The rooms are very small. Their restaurant (Red Fin) is quite yummy.The biggest issue: the room we got was dark, I mean really dark - the window (!!!FROSTED!!!) 'opened' into a narrow grey space (not an alley or inner yard) with an adjucent building wall at 10ft. But wait, there is more: the other building had commercial (!!!) airconditioning units NEXT to our room windows. Every 30-45min we got to enjoy noise as loud as on the airplane. After we complained, they moved us to a different room. Still frosted window, still 10ft to the next wall, but at least further away from the airconditioning units. We could still hear them, though the noise was muted - like sleepping next to a household airconditioner. Probably 1/4 of their rooms open to the same narrow space.I'd not recomend the hotel, unless you can somehow garantee that they will give you one of those rooms.

<Content>Best beds in the world! Hotel Max came highly recommended by friends and we gave it a try on a two night stay in Seattle. It is centrally located, within a 10 minute walk of Pike Place Market and 15 minute walk to the Space Needle. The decor is artsy, minimalistic, industrial. Rooms are tight but nicely done, and the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Despite being on a busy street, the room was pretty quite with the windows closed. Unfortunately, the air conditioner didn't put out very cool air so our room was stuffy.The bathroom had only one small shelf for laying out makeup and toiletries, which was a problem for two women. And the steep, but small, step up to the bathroom was hard to get used to.The staff was incredibly helpful, and made some great off-the-beaten-track food recommendations - although we were sent to one restaurant for breakfast that did not open until noon.All in all, it was a great stay and I will definitely go back on my next trip. The rate was very reasonable given the service, comfort and amenities.

<Content>Very cool rooms in a good location Hotel Max is a refurbished older building in central location in Seattle. The rooms are beautifully decorated in a minimalist kind of way. Very modern bathroom--ours had a step in shower. Rates are also moderate.Our only small gripe was that the very young staff are not all well-versed on services and local places of interest. We asked about a non-coffee bar place for breakfast and were advised to try the greasiest spoon in the city. A block and a half from the hotel was the terrific Lola Restaurant that had an outstanding breakfast. We would definitely stay at the Max again.

<Content>not for family stay not for families with kids. Nice but cool front desk people. Manager very nice. spotty service. One time we were fawned over the next time ignored. If you are hip and trendy, this is the spot for you. If you are not, like us, the start with walking into a space with a topless painting is not for us. While the painting does not offend me, the 6 and 10 year old kids were stunned.

<Content>Will not be back to Hotel Max I saw Hotel Max listed as one of Travelzoo's Top 10 deals, so I went ahead and tried it. It was a mistake. The special said they would upgrade the room to a King if they were available, but of course they weren't. I have stayed at many downtown Seattle hotels and this has been the worst experience yet. My biggest complaint is the size of the rooms, bathrooms and elevator. These are New York size hotel rooms at New York prices, but this is Seattle. You can get a much better value in any of the nearby hotels, Sheraton, Westin, W, Andre, etc. The artwork certainly does not make up for feeling like you're in a closet. The bathroom shower is so small, I could barely pick up my soap when I dropped it, and I am not a big person. Of the two elevators (each can hold only 3-4 people with no luggage), one was out of service. So everyone was walking down 7,8,9+flights of stairs, only to realize that you still have to get on the elevator at the 2nd floor to get to the lobby. There was quite a line-up on this floor.

<Content>Loved The Hotel Max My husband and I stayed in the Hotel Max over the fourth of July weekend. We absolutely loved everything except for the size of the room (we stayed in their standard King room). The amenities, service, comfort level, location, value and cleanliness were all superb. The bed was extremely comfortable. Our friends stayed at the Hyatt just down the street and paid twice as much for a bigger, but comparable room. We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you Hotel Max for a wonderful stay!

<Content>Hip with no Attitude This was my second stay at Hotel Max. I found out about it last year when a wedding party stayed there. This time, I brought my six-year-old son. Traveling alone with a child can be hard if they don't help with doors or if they're just not welcoming. Even though this hotel is hip and artsy, everyone there was friendly toward my son and it was easy to be there with him. There's no attitude. You have to hide the vibrator and candy when you first get in the room!It's very easy to walk from there to the market and aquarium. The monorail to the Space Needle is a couple blocks up. There are tons of places to eat and you can bring snacks back from the market to your room.I'm an artist so I like the feel of the place. It's probably best for someone with that mind set. There's a nude painting in the lobby so if you're very conservative, you won't like to bring kids there.Room is very comfortable. Feels small but luxurious.

<Content>Exploring Seattle The hotel is very well located in the down-town area. The room was modern and very clean. The people at the reception desk could be a little less cool and somewhat more customer-oriented. The fitness center was good and open 24h.

<Content>Hotel Max is very cool We really liked Hotel Max - the look is different and fun and our stay was really very pleasant. I heard about how some of the rooms were smaller but I asked for a larger room if possible and I got one. At the same time when I called they offered to move our travelling companions to the same floor (if possible) and it was done. The doorman that first day was really nice and helpful. I'm from the south so I'm used to more open friendly types but I did notice Seattle was not exactly like that - nice, but not overly friendly so it may seem to some people that they are a bit cold - I think it is just a different culture. The only complaint I had was that when I called to ask them the best way to get to the airport they stated a cab or town car. I wish they had mentioned that there is a really reasonable Downtown/Airport bus as well - we could have saved some money as the cab drive was about $40 but the shuttle would have been $22 for two people. Other then that I would totally recommend this place - it was a good value in a very convenient location with a certain cool ambience.

<Content>Are you growing weary of boutique hotels? I am torn on my review of the Max. First, they did a great job remodeling what was a former hotel in dire need of a facelift. I don't think they made the rooms smaller to make just a little more $$ every night, but I do think the Max is the poster child for overpriced, slightly pretentious, minimalist, boutique hotels. Staff was great and I had a view of the Space Needle but with two of us in the room, it was not comfortable. We checked out early for this reason. Like others have said, at the price the Max asks, there are just better, more roomier options. Perhaps they'll get their room rates in check with the product they're offering and then everything will be in check.

<Content>A Romantic Weekend My wife and I recently stayed at the Hotel Max in Downtown Seattle and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was our first 鈥淩omantic Weekend鈥?in over 20 years so needless to say, our hopes and expectations were very high. We weren鈥檛 disappointed. The Hotel is convenient to many downtown attractions, restaurants and shops and the staff were genuinely friendly and accommodating. We will continue to recommend the Hotel Max to friends 鈥渨ithout children鈥?who want a convenient and romantic spot to escape to. Give this clean, artfully inspired hotel a try the next time you visit the Emerald City.We anticipate taking another Alaskan Cruise next year and we are looking forward to another romantic weekend at the Hotel Max.

<Content>Pricey and noisy, but cool I made the mistake of booking a room at Hotel Max for 10 days. I should have gone with another hotel. 10 days was too long. The Hotel Max is good for a 1 or 2 night stay. It's funky and in a good location. The service is good and the attached restaurant is also very good. The rooms are small, the walls thin, and unless you get a room at the back (like I had to request after settling into my first room at midnight) buses will be rolling by your window well into the night. The Hotel Max is a good choice, but for the price, the Fairmont or the W would be a better choice.

<Content>Funky hotel; good location The hotel was clean and conveniently located within four or so blocks of the convention center. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows (and pillow choices). As a single woman traveling alone, the hotel felt very safe. The bellmen were helpful with luggage, etc. A Seattle Times was provided every morning at my door.The rooms were small, but I was happy that my window opened to let in the cool, fresh evening air.No vending machines, but a deli a half block away was convenient (snacks provided in the room were a bit pricey for my pocketbook; the other in-room convenience items were, well, facinating). I stayed in the hotel a week. My shampoo and conditioner were not replaced until I asked the cleaning staff to provide more. She provided two shampoo, two conditioner and two lotions.

<Content>Hotel Max Has Ruined Us Forever... My husband and I spent one night at the Hotel Max this past week during a long-weekend-getaway to Seattle, and now, I'm terribly afraid we will never, ever be able to stay at another hotel EVER without feeling longing for The Max. From the endearingly welcoming response to my reservation email from manager Chris Bebo, the Max Daddy, to the stunning lobby, to the phenomenal staff who managed to be extremely cool and yet adorably warm at the same time, to the absolutely, utterly one-of-a-kind rooms with their intensely modern yet somehow still fabulously cozy decor, to the fun-and-fast parking valets, each and every detail was designed to delight, and delight it did.To the traveler who is looking for a bed-and-breakfast, Laura Ashley decorated flowerfest of chintz and ruffles, or to the mom-and-dad-and noisy-kids-where's-the-pool family, or to the hard-to-please AARP traveler who insists on a shower cap and a Cracker Barrel restaurant next door, this may not be the be-all end-all of hotels. But to the curious, adventurous, hip traveler with an expanded consciousness and a taste for pure originality combined with streamlined luxury, this could well be the ultimate in hotel nirvana. From our two-queen room on the outside wall, we had a marvelous view of this most fascinating of cities; and we could, as well, hear the sounds of it, a blended symphony of traffic and life itself that for us, was pure bliss; for others it may be somewhat less enchanting but I would plead with anyone who has issues with street noise here, or anywhere, to open yourself to it as part of the glorious experience of travel. Absolute quiet is for the bathtub in your own bathroom; if you are traveling to a never-stop city like Seattle, by all means, immerse yourself in all that it has to offer every one of your senses!It was with incredible reluctance that we checked out after our one night at the Max, vowing and bowing and praying and promising that we will be back, soon and often. A supremely luxurious experience that was, at the same time, so cutting-edge that it gleamed...a place where art and thick towels somehow do not seem incongruous, where you can order spiritual tracts from the room service menu, and where you can cuddle down into the most comfortable bed ever to nestle your jet-lagged butt. Rock and pillows and art and towels..seamlessly presented, lovingly shared, with a wink and chuckle and gleaming red elevator. Someday they will write about the things that happened, the minds that met, at the Hotel Max in Seattle at the turn of the millenium...go, be part of it.

<Content>can't beat the great staff Could the rooms be bigger? Yes. Could their be a small restuarant on site? Yes. Was the staff most receptive? Absolutely. I travel a lot and tend to rate my hotels by the staff first, and this staff was overwhelmingly accomodating. They are there to help as much as possible. Would be nice to have internet included, but their business center was excellent and most accomodating.kb, ohio

<Content>Slept Well in Seattle We stay in hotels for a variety of reasons, but the bottom line is we all want a good nights' sleep. That you will get at the Hotel Max. They have THE MOST comfortable beds of any hotel I have ever stayed at, along with a variety of pillow of varying hardness if you desire . In addition, the rooms are well sound-proofed. I never heard any sound from the adjoining rooms or hallway.The location is great - near the Airporter shuttle stop (at the Westin) and within easy walking distance of Westlake shopping, the monorail and Pike's Market. The price was right too - in the same area as the high priced Westin and Warwick, the Hotel Max is a great value.If I had to offer any criticism, it would be the dim lighting over the bathroom sink - not great for putting on makeup. However, that's hardly worth mentioning given how well I slept there!

<Content>Just So So I think the hotel is over priced and well not really that great. The location is pretty good and the rooms clean, they give that little funk appeal but soooo small. I really would rather stay at Hotel 1000 or the W for pretty much the same price. I would stay again only if rate were much less. I will say that the service is very good though. Nice friendly and helpful staff. I am a resort owner in a tourist town and we charge 450 for our largest room with 2 bedrooms, 2 bath, jacuzzi , fireplace, 42 inch plasmas and they are on the water so just found it hard to pay that much for just and average place.

<Content>Remarkable Service I have never had anyone work so quickly and effortlessly to make sure my needs were met. I am a frequent guest of the Hotel DeLuxe in Portland and thoroughly enjoy it. So when my business travels extended recently into Seattle, it seemed only natural to stay at the Hotel Max. I was pleased and thoroughly enjoyed my recent stay. When I was checking out at approximately 4:30 a.m., the front desk manager informed me that my car was stuck in the parking garage due to a malfunction of the elevator system. He said he had already called an elevator service, but due to the time of day, he had received no response. When I told him I needed to get to the airport to catch a 6:00 a.m. flight, he merely shook his head in agreement, made a phone call, and had a car at the front of the Hotel within ten minutes to take me to the airport free of charge. He also agreed to return my rental car to the airport when it was 鈥渇reed鈥?from the parking garage. He never hesitated for one moment trying to figure out what to do. I have never had anyone work so quickly and effortlessly to make sure my needs were met. There was no stress, no hesitation, no questioning. He handled everything with grace and extreme ease. My kudos to your staff and your management skills. I am looking forward to my next visit to Seattle.

<Content>Nicest People! We recently stayed at Hotel Max on the end of an Alaskan cruise. I prebooked/payed for the hotel after doing lots of research online. I wanted a hotel that was convientaly located and not terribly expensive, while also having some character. Max was all of those things. We went to drop off our bags early in the morning right when we got off the cruise. We didn't expect to be allowed to check in since check in time was 3:00. However my 10 month old was sick so I asked if we could at least check in early. Not were we allowed to check in early, but we were checked in by 10 am. Fantastic! We also had the whole next day in Seattle since our flight didn't leave until 11:50 that night. They were so great they even let us stay until our flight, and charged us half the room rate. We were totally thankful, as anyone knows with kids, those long days can be rough. It was really great of the staff to work with our schedule.On top of that our room was super cute and the art everywhere was great and our son loved looking at it all. There are also some really great little extras in the rooms that make your stay that much better. I would totally recommend Hotel Max to young couples, and anyone with an open mind.

<Content>Fantastic affordable boutique hotel in great location My boyfriend and I recently stayed here. I had done my research and noticed that a lot of reviewers mentioned that the rooms were a little small. I contacted the Max Daddy (a.k.a. - Chris Bebo), and asked to have a larger room. He not only booked us in a larger Artist King room, but also gave me the additional pricing if I wanted to upgrade to the Deluxe Rooms. We stuck with the larger artist king since we were only staying for 4 nights. It was perfect for the two of us. We had a great view and it was a cozy and hip room. The hotel and rooms really reminded me of a smaller, less expensive W that I have stayed at in NYC. There is little storage space and the bathroom is small. When I did more research, I found out that Hotel Max used to be an older hotel, which explains the smaller bathrooms. I personally thought they were cute and completely sufficient. To solve the storage problems, I asked for more hangers and less than 10 minutes later, we had them. The staff was very helpful, someone was always at the front desk for any questions or needs we had. Harry made sure we had a cab for our night out and a car for the airport. I HIGHLY recommend getting a car instead of a cab. It's cheaper, safer and nicer of an automobile. Also, the hotel is close to many attractions, shopping and restaurants. We only needed to cab somewhere once, we were able to walk everywhere else. I definitely like the boutique feel that a lot of hotels are doing nowadays and Hotel Max does that, but with much cheaper pricing, but not cheap service. Needless to say, we really enjoyed our stay and time in Seattle. If we were to visit again in the near future, I would definitely stay at Hotel Max!

<Content>Worst hotel ever... Where to begin... My wife and I were going to Seattle to visit family, and decided to try this boutique style of hotel. This is not the first time staying in a boutique hotel, but certainly my last here. Having worked in hotels in the past, I know how to treat the customers, obviously these people do not.When we checked in, and we were not offered any bellstaff for our bags (5 bags for 2 people is bulky), we went to our room, and small it was. That is fine, we were expecting this, so no big deal. As soon as we got there we went down to RedFin which wa a GREAT rest. The people there are amazing, and VERY friendly... Too bad it is not part of the hotel. They warned us to go down if we wanted a beer instead of ordering through room service. This way we could save the $3.00 added fee for delivery. I went back up to my room, and then came down again 10 minutes later. The maintenance staff, housekeepers, staff, and just about everyone has to fit into the 2 SMALL elevators. The staff does not ahve their own elevators. I had to fit in there with the bellboy, and his cart (not an easy fit, and I am not big).We went out the next morning and left the towels on the floor, no coffee, no tea, and no more shampoo, conditioner, or soap. We came back that evening and guess what... No towels, no coffee, not tea, no shampoo, no conditioner, and no soap. We called down and got all of the above, but of course we tipped the service.Next day we got up and went out again. We step out and it is raining... DAMN, we forgot our umbrella in SF. So we are stuck walking around int he rain. all day (staf at the door does not open door, and does not offer anything for the rain, or to get a cab for us). We come back to the hotel and guesswhat we don't have???? YUP, no towels, no coffee, no tea, no shampoo, no conditioner, no soap. But we also seem to be missing my wife's birth control pills. someone STOLE my wife's pills!?!?!?!?!?!?! they were there that morning (she took one).Next day I go out early in the AM to meet up with a buddy. I came back with coffee for myself and my wife. I have 2 cups of coffee in 2 hands, and the doorman is too busy texting on his phone to open the door for me!!!! i had to stack the cups before the doorman noticed I was there. Speaking of doormen, is that really what they are there to do? open doors is their job... But God forbid they do their job. They spend the entire time talking to each other (Cracking jokes), on their phones, or texting (1 guy did offer to get us a cab on evening)...Checkout day was the straw that broke the camel's back... We go down to check out, and a few things came up. I asked about a cab to the airport, and I was told that the hotel would have a town car take us. GREAT, for only $5.00 more I was all about that. Nice, BIG, comfy towncar or a cab... Not a tough call. We check our bags in and get our 5 bag tags. My wife and I went out for a while and came back for our bags and the ride to the hotel. NOW the fun begins. I go out back to go to the restroom, and I saw the door to the baggage storing area WIDE OPEN, and NO ONE was around the room. I waited for over 20 mintes, and no one showed up to close the door. I could have gone in and taken anything i wanted during this time. I went back outfront and gave the guys my bag tags, and they came out with the wrong bag... I mean COME ON!!!! So we get the right bags, and get to the towncar. All of a sudden some lady decided to get in the car with us. I guess the hotel overbooked the towncar, andwe were supposed to share our car with another lady?!?!?!?!!? So in the end, I would say do NOT stay at this hotel. The size is small, but the service is horrendous. I would have expected more from a Best Western hotel in the projects of San Francisco.

<Content>Is there a term better than AWESOME? Awesome. It was more than just the stay. From the first contact with the hotel everything was perfect. I had constant emails from Kathleen who provided me with the reservation, car service and restaurant. As promised the car service was waiting at the airport and provided a safe trip to the hotel. Upon arrival the staff was there to open all doors and wouldn't let us lift a finger to help with the luggage, even the smallest of bags. The young ladies at the front desk were wonderful. After checking in they explained to us where everything was in the hotel and assisted us with all the questions we had. The rooms were wonderful, not for those who want a country type setting. This is a city hotel room. Very modern, very clean. A complimentary bottle of wine awaited our arrival in the room as well. Upon arriving at the restaurant that evening, we were told that when the hotel called to make our reservations, they also wanted us to have a complimentary appetizer. The next day at check-out they assisted with the storage of bags and for the town car transfer to the airport. When in Seattle, stay at the Hotel Max!

<Content>Mixed bag I just returned from a quick weekend stay in Seattle with my partner.Originally, we wanted to stay at the W Hotel or the Westin. However, by the time I got around to making the reservation, those prices had shot up over $300/night. So I came across the Hotel Max. I read some reviews about it and they were pretty mixed. Some people complained about the tiny rooms, unsanitary conditions, the two gals canoodling on the lobby sofa (get over it!).With the understanding that you just can't please everyone, and a room rate of about $140/nite, we decided to give it a try and got the Queen of Art room.We rented a car at Sea-Tac and drove into town. We pulled up to the front of the hotel, registered and passed car keys on.The hotel is housed in an older building, but completely modern throughout. The lobby ceilings are coved with detailing, the only obvious evidence of a former life. The lobby, room doors and room interiors have lots of very interesting art on/in them. Our room was larger than I was prepared for. Everything looked very clean and the color palate was very attractive. Flat screen TV was nice touch too. The bathroom is quite small, and the shower stall is even smaller. The bed was very comfortable and on par with Heavenly beds. Don't expect much for views. We had a view of the top of a small building and the smoking garden of a nearby high-rise condo. We were awakened by screeching seagulls both mornings, but they moved on after a few minutes. Our room was right next to the elevators. We never heard people talking (place is actually very quiet), but we could hear the cables of the car going up and down. My advice is to get a room further away from elevators.The hotel has a restaurant/bar called Red Fin right next door. It's a very cool entrance from the lobby. There is a dark wall that has art on it. On the far left, there is a tall stainless handle attached the wall. It is actually the door into Red Fin that is integrated into the wall. Red Fin was pretty good. Very cool interior, with selection of tables, sushi bar and high bar tables. Nice music playing, not too loud. I believe they have a live band for Sunday brunch. They serve decent sushi/rolls and nice, elegant cocktails. We stopped in there after a late dinner for a cocktail and again for a pre-dinner nosh and cocktail. Prices are reasonable.Hotel Max is not for everyone, but we saw a very nice mix of people there: straight, gay, young, all races, families, girls' weekend, etc. The location is hard to beat (Stewart/7th). We were a block from the new light rail, 2 blocks from great shopping, a nice walk to the Market, and tons of restaurants and bars down on 1st Ave. (Belltown).I wasn't bothered by the small bath that much, but we were only there 2 nights and rarely spent much time in our room. My biggest complaint is the parking situation. We got dressed and ready for dinner and we headed down to get our car. No one could find our car and we waited over 25 minutes for them to track down. At checkout the next morning, it was even worse. The valets were running around like crazy looking for cars, parking cars, forgetting to give people their keys after checkout, etc. It was like watching the keystone cops. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our car. Apparently they have 2 lots (one behind hotel and one offsite). It's not really clear to them in which lot the car ended up. We were very cool about it, but some people showed their displeasure. At a rate of $30/day for hotel guest parking, they need to do a better job of keeping track of people's cars. The manager on duty that morning, Alyssa, was exceptional. Even with all the buzz of people checking out and in, she had her eye out for us, making sure the valets were on the hunt for our car. Finally, she came out from behind the desk to personally apologize for the situation and offered to adjust our bill to take off the parking. I thought that was very classy and probably earned our business again in the future. I would definitely recommend this fun, friendly, artsy hotel with a hard-to-beat location, at reasonable prices. I would say rent a car at your own risk. Hopefully, they'll have figured out a better parking system by then.

<Content>Tiny Just a warning before you go. The parking was 40 dollars a day for parking, and the attendant couldn't even tell me where my car would be. The art work was very cool and fun to look at, but that is really the only upside. My husband couldn't put up the toilet seat because it hit the toilet paper holder and kept it from going up. This is sort of and indication of just how small the bathroom was. I am 5'1, 120 pounds I barely fit in the shower. The room itself is just as small. I've stayed in Seattle quite a bit, and this is not worth the money!!!

<Content>Loved the Service and Style I stayed at the Hotel Max for a weekend getaway from the kids. I had seen it driving by a couple of times and it looked alright but truly the style on the inside surprised me. It's a trendy interior and every wall is covered in art. The room doors are photographs on all different subjects (some are artsy and some are themed like the grunge floor). The room had a flat screen televison, and a really comfy bed (which is the highlight for the room)! The ser vice was really the best part of this hotel. The front desk staff and valet staff were all very inviting and could always be counted on for conversation or reccomendations. They used my name most of the time that I was there, and what surprised me is that I saw a couple of them in the halls and they asked me how I was enjoying my stay and if I needed anything else.It was really great to get this treatment in a hotel! I would definitly stay here again!

<Content>Beyond Small! My husband and I are particularly fond of funky/modern boutique hotels, however the size of our room left us a bit disappointed. The rooms were clean and decorated cool, but there was very little space. We weren't expecting a 900 square foot suite, but it was so small we could hardly find carpet to walk on! The bathroom was hands down the smallest either of us had ever seen in our lives. Although maybe there is advantage to being able to shower, sit on the toilet and wash your hands all at the same time. The sushi restaurant attached to the hotel was great, and the staff were all friendly enough. It was also a good location being close to shopping and Pike Place Market.

<Content>Dirty hotel with blood stained bed linen plus vaccum dirt In early Jan, I decided to spend 2 nights with my husband + 2 kids at Hotel Max because of the child stays free promotion plus the hip photos that I've aw on the website. So, I booked it directly through the website and I really regreted that I've made that choice!I do not recommend this hotel for anyone because it is a dirty hotel. We checked in really late (around 1am) that night and the front desk receptionist (guy)'s attitude was rude. He kept on asking if we would like the valet parking service for 25/day and we told him we don't need it (The fact is that we already park the car on the street in front of the hotel for free because it's the weekend) Anyways, the worse part is that when we went inside the room, we found out that the bed was really dirty. It looked fine on the outside but when we tried to pull down the blanket, there were so much vaccum dirt + one old blood stained spot on the bed linen. Because it was late at night and my children were very sleepy, I did not ask for a change of room at that moment. My husband just swiped off all the dirt (vaccum dirt + fur ball) for both beds (we stayed in the art of two beds) , put the dirty blood stained linen away and then placed our children on bed. Problems arose middle of the night because my 1 year old baby kept on crying due to the uncomfortability of the bed. Then, I discovered that her skin turned red because she was allergic to the dust that we did not completely swiped off. My poor little girl did not sleep for the night and so did I. At 10am, I complained to the front desk and he upgraded us to another bigger room. (His reaction was so normal as if it was just another same complain)Still, the same problem for the other room but the condition seems better, just a little fur ball + few hair.......... Also, when we took our shower at night, we had to do it quick because there was not enough hot water for 4 of us. It costed me almost US280/2 nights. At first, I thought it was a decent, chic and hip boutique hotel, but in fact, I was cheated by the beatifully designed website. This is just a nightmare for me and my children!!! I would never stayed at this hotel again.

<Content>We liked this hotel I stayed at this hotel with my wife back in May 2000. We really enjoyed this hotel. Check in went smoothly and the staff was warm and welcoming, I sure hope all the staff are still working at this hotel. They have changed name from Vance Hotel to Hotel Max. Our room was fantastic with nice view of downtown Seattle and we could see the monorail passing by. We had a corner room.When you are staying at Stewart street, you can walk to almost everything in downtown Seattle. We really recommend Pike Place Market in Seattle with all the fresh seafood. Just a 10 -15 minute walk from the hotel.We are looking forward at staying at this hotel once again on our next visit to Seattle.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I'm a little late writing this review, but I stayed at the Hotel Max while in Seattle for business and loved it. Fantastic restaurant in the lobby, friendly/helpful staff and nice comfy rooms. Will certainly stay here again when I'm back in 08!

<Content>Modern, Hip and Convenient My girlfriend and I spent 2 nights over the long weekend (American Thanksgiving) in Nov here. We found it to be hip and modern - if you are a Holiday Inn or Traveller's Lodge type of vacationer, this place is probably not the place for you. The hotel is in a lovely historic building - which puts some obvious space constraints to the rooms, etc. However, its no different than your modern European hotels (this is what this place reminded me of). We had an awesome corner room on the 9th floor, and street noise was not an issue (as previous reviews suggested). The bed was amazingly comfortable, reminded me of the Heavenly Beds you get at the Westin. I highly would recommend this hotel if you want a unique, modern, hip experience in Seattle. Its good value too. The front desk staff was amazingly friendly, and the valet parking is a nice touch ($25/day w/in-out privileges is not bad for downtown). The restaurant beside it is convenient for quick breakfast bites (good) or a drink, but if you are in Seattle on vacation, not sure why anyone would eat at a hotel restaurant period when there are so many great places around (i.e. Pike Market). The location is pretty central to all the shopping and to Pike (about 3-4 blocks). The next time I am Seattle, I would definitely stay here again (and recommend it to friends too). Pros:- modern, hip and different- friendly front desk staff- valet parking- very comfortable queen bedCons:- small bathrooms, but functional

<Content>Wanted to love it - but inconsistent. We stayed here for four nights and while some things were positively brilliant, other things really disappointed. The art and photography makes this place different than most, and we had a look at the photos on a few different floors just to appreciate it. We did have to laugh as the content of much of the work is quite adult -- no problem with us, but we seen details of a 'children stay free' promotion and thought it might have been a bit of a challenge in that instance. I am sure the artwork in various rooms makes this just fine, however.Other positives for us: we ate in the restaurant twice - once for dinner and once for breakfast - and had an excellent experience both times. (And if you don't fancy their breakfast, Top Pot Donuts  Coffee is a nice little walk away and far nicer than the gazillion chain shops you'll pass on the way.) Very nice beds  bedding. Elevator seemed to be set to never stop on the way, which provided it isn't busy, is cool. Not once did I have to feel guilty because there wasn't room for someone else due to my luggage.Some days, very attentive and friendly staff on the door. The disappointments: when we checked in, we were sent to a room that was still occupied. It wasn't as awkward as it could have been, and we were quickly given a new room, but the experience was a bit worrying. Parking is a general problem in downtown Seattle -- the hotel has secure, valet-only parking for $25 a day, or there is a pay lot directly across the street that could be a little cheaper if you wanted to feed meters and pay each time you move the car. Some days, the staff on the door didn't acknowledge our presence, whether we needed help or not.I totally dig what they want to be...I guess I just thought for the price we paid that it would actually live up to it. Some days yes, other days not at all.

<Content>Now that's central! The location of this hotel cannot be more central. We were literally no more than a 15-minute walk from most of where you鈥檇 want to visit in downtown Seattle. Pioneer Square and Olympic Sculpture Park are a bit farther afield (in opposite directions) but still within walking range or a quick 7-dollar cab ride away. It鈥檚 also a 10-dollar cab ride away from the 1st Hill and Capitol Hill neighborhoods. Equally important, the service is superb. Everyone, whether at the desk or the entrance, is extremely attentive, ready to help with any questions one might have, and simply pleasant (without being overbearing). The original pieces of local art in the lobby and the rooms are refreshing. And, the visual design of the hallways leading to the rooms is particularly smart offering a welcoming surprise once you step out of the elevator going to your room. This is certainly not a cookie-cutter hotel. We also had an OK pancake breakfast with very good coffee on the house at the hotel restaurant conspicuously located at the lobby level. And for those so inclined, Starbucks is down the block (well, its Seattle after all).The rooms are smallish but comfortable. The ones overlooking the back are very quiet, but do not offer much of a view. We suspect the ones overlooking 7th St would have a nice view of the new courthouse but probably not immune from traffic noise. Speaking of which, the one big downside to the rooms is the heating and cooling system, which is based on a unit fixed to the window frame. When on, it almost feels like you have a vacuum cleaner hanging around with you! We heated up the room while away and turned that little monster off before going to bed, which worked out perfectly well as the Seattle Nov climate is temperate鈥攑robably there would be only a few days in the winter or summer when this approach might not work that well. The king bed felt luxurious鈥攖hough on the soft side for our taste鈥攁nd quite a bit of pillows are on offer, a la cart. In our room the bathroom consisted of two separate rooms, one for the toilet and sink and the other for the shower. At first glance it seemed odd, but turned out to be pretty comfortable. The location, service, and visual feel of the place more than compensates for the few minor glitches. We鈥檒l definitely stay there again without any hesitation.

<Content>Stay somewhere else I travel quite a bit for business, but consider myself to be 'hip and knowledgeable'.People have described this as an 'artsy' hotel, but I would describe it as more alternative than anything. Yes, there are paintings in the room of local and up and coming artists, and each door has its own artist covering of a painting or print. All for supporting local artists, they lose the hospitality aspect of being a hotel. The majority of rooms are SMALL. One bed and a desk, and you have to shimmy by them to get through. The closet is a half closet where clothes hang sideways. There is no place to open an ironing board.Here are some more drawbacks:-It's loud! The walls are paper thin, I heard every word of a conversation in the room beside me. If you have a room on the Stewart side of the street, say goodbye to sleeping.-The gym is the size of a closet, forget about stretching. There are two treadmills, two ellepticals and one bench with free weights. They don't clean the area or supply enough towels.-The restaurant is absolutely ridiculous. There was a group of us for breakfast, we forewarned them to be prepared. I waited 1 hour for my breakfast after ordering it 3 times, dirty silverware, a server who had no idea what was going on.-I called the front desk just to be transferred to another room 3 times, each time I was put on hold after my request and not transferred. Ok so they were busy...but how long does it take to transfer a phone call!??!?-The wireless internet was nearly impossible to use, and the elevators were so slow!-More than once I waited for an elevator only to have it open and see the cleaning staff with their back to the door having a conversation. So that's why I waited for one of the TWO elevators for so long! One of them was on hold due to a social conversation!The good stuff:-comfortable beds and linensSorry but I cannot recommend this to anyone, other than a deaf mute artist who has a need for a personal vibrator kit (it's part of the mini-bar). Oh and they don't need to room service or to work out.

<Content>Posh with a twist From the moment I walked in I knew there was something unique about this hotel. The ambiance set the mood which was both intriguing and satisfying. The bedroom was small, but intimate with everything a girl would want....voluminous pillows, the finest sheets, and a comforter that you wanted to wrap yourself in along side your bed mate. You will be extremely pleased with the decor, the comfort, and the extras that are found in the room.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised I didn't know what to expect with the Hotel Max. My mother and I had stayed several times before at the Vance Hotel. We found our room to be very comfortable and clean. Super kushy beds. We asked for a quiet room and got a room on the top floor and we slept really well. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They seemed a little green though at times and one employee was downright rude. Although, I think he didn't know what he was doing (helping us when our electronic key wouldn't work). In all I was very pleasantly surprised by the service, standards and cleanliness. One particular bellhop was very sweet and went above and beyond. Thanks Andrew...Great location two blocks from shopping and 6 blocks from the Pike Place Market.

<Content>Prime Location in Downtown Seattle We spent four nights at the Hotel Max in Seattle and had a fantastic experience. From our initial impression of the hotel through to our last moment leaving, we have nothing but positive comments about the hotel and the staff.The nicest thing about this hotel is the location - it was so easy to find, we got off our exit from the I-5 and literally drove up to the door of the hotel. The valet parking staff were excellent, and once we had parked the car at the hotel, we never once required it again, as the downtown location allowed us to walk or take the monorail wherever wanted to go. We walked to Pike Place, Pioneer Square, the main shopping district, and all through Belltown and back again with no difficulty at all.Each time we would return to the hotel, we were greeted by smiling and courteous staff. We asked a few questions of the front desk and had a few requirements, all of which were satifisfied immediately. The only amenity we used was the computer in the business center, which was helpful for investigating which great restaurant we would venture to that evening.We stayed in a corner room with a king size bed on the 9th floor. The room was stunning - well designed with a view of the Space Needle and the EMP from our window. I think this was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in at a hotel, and that includes a stay at the Westin. It was very hard to get out of bed every morning it was so comfortable! The bathrooms were well appointed and we used the complimentary toiletries and robes throughout our stay.The only very minor complaint that I would make is to comment on the small size of the room. We had been forewarned of that thanks to the other reviews on this site, and so I wasn't surprised at how small it was, but I was glad that I went here with that expectation. There was enough room for one person to walk around the bed, but no sitting area. If I was to return to Seattle again, I would likely stay at another hotel if I was to plan a longer stay again, just because it would be nice to have a slightly larger room for that length of vacation. However, for a single or double night stay I would gladly stay at Hotel Max again and would definitely recommend it to others as an option. The location and style of the hotel outmatched anything else we investigated at a similar price.

<Content>The Hotel Max: Kinda Funky and Cool.... My wife and I stayed at the Max on 10/18/07 in Room #1019. This is an 'Artist King Room on the top floor with a nice Capital Hill view. Entering the hotel, the first things you notice are the funky and cool art work and the soft sounds of reggae music playing in the lobby. The hotel staff from the doormen to the front desk employees were very friendly and helpful. The room which was on the small side(this should be expected for a building built in the early 1900's) had a very comfortable king bed and pillows, hairdryer, coffee maker and a window a/c unit. The hotel location for downtown access is wonderful, just a couple blocks to Pike Place Market, Pacific Place Mall, West Lake Mall, The Seattle Convention Center, Nordstroms and the Monrail Station to the Seattle Center. A pleasent surprise was the Japanese restuarant connected to the hotel called Red Fin. Very good sushi and a great happy hour 4-6:00pm and 10:00pm-1:00am. We would stay here again on our next visit to Seattle.

<Content>Hotel Max could be even better It was a last minute booking using the phone number shown on a Tripadvisor hotel page - in haste I thought it was a direct line to a hotel (not Hotel Max) but it became clear that it was a booking agency. Most hotels were full and we were offered a room at Hotel Max. I do not recall being asked if I wanted a smoke free room, or being warned that we would be in a smokers' room. I arrived late in the evening, for a one night stay and no alternative room was available.The hotel was good. The smoke in the room very bad. Subsequently management reacted very positively and showed great concern. Apparently less than 10% of their rooms are for smokers. I hope they will join with so many good hotels and become completely smoke free.So do stay at Hotel Max, but in the short term make sure you know what sort of room you are getting. I personally will try and avoid booking hotels through a booking agency.

<Content>Happy all around The wife and I really liked our stay. I too was nervous about the room size, but not overly concerned, as we have stayed in small European hotels. Our solo room was fine - queen or king bed that was ultrasoft and comfortable with many pillows, there was decent leg room around both sides, and the bathroom was small but ample enough for one person at a time. Service was great, and the business center was helpful, but there are only 2 computers, so plan accordingly. Small gym on the 2nd floor. The only negative was our TV image was kind of dark and the volume was different for each channel. It worked well enough we dealt with it, but if you're planning a night inside for movies, check your TV first.

<Content>You can do better Hotel Max pretends to be hip at the expense of safety and comfort. The rooms are so small a young person feels closed in and the elevators are so small that we felt claustrophobic. At one point, they stopped working and we were trapped. Staffwas not helpful. Service workers were seen using guest elevators, and on and on and on... Get the picture? Plus, the beds were not comfortable. Go over to the Vintage Park.

<Content>Funky  We booked this hotel months in advance via Hotwire. We needed four rooms, and got them for $103 per night, for a pre-cruise stay. This hotel was listed as a 3 1/2 star boutique hotel, which I would say is exactly what we got. We arrived before 1pm from the East Coast, and were very happy that we had no problems checking in that early.All eight of us loved the Hotel Max! Yes, the rooms are small, especially the bathrooms, but it's great preparation for the cruise bathrooms. This hotel has character! From the guys standing out front, to the front desk, they're young and friendly. Artwork throughout the hotel is unique and sexy. The bed was comfortable, and we got a kick out of the extra amenities in the room. (not that we used them...perhaps, if we hadn't stayed up so late in the hotel restaurant for late-night happy hour :) ) This hotel reminded me of unique boutique hotels I've stayed at in San Francisco and New York. It is NOT for anyone wanting a cookie-cutter hotel experience.The location, by the way, is PERFECT. Less than a $10 cab-ride to Pier 66 and the boarding of our cruise. An easy walk to Pike's. It's very close to the Westin, and Il Fornaio (great Italian restaurant, if you're hungry for Italian).We actually went back to the Hotel Max after our cruise to take a few pictures, as we had failed to do so when we were actually staying there.

<Content>Hotel Max is a aphrodiasiac Hotel Max was exactly what i expected from reading previous reviews. The bright pink paint on the curb helped us to find the hotel easily. Once we pulled up the valet service was extremely helpful and friendly. When you walk into the lobby there is some adult only art on the walls, but it is not trashy by any means. The room was pretty small along with the bathroom. Everything was extremely clean. Loved the menu of snacks and also the opportunity to order pillows to your liking. I did not remember that it was a 21+ hotel until we found the mini massager and intimacy kit and then it all came together why the hotel was labeled as such. It was really nice not to have kids running around. We did not experience any of the paper thin wall noise as others have complained of. Hotel Max is trendy and sexy and there is definately something in the air (or perhaps they spray phermones on the sheets). Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Great Experience at Hotel Max Our weekend stay was part of our honeymoon and we were completely pleased with the staff, rooms and ammenities. The bar/restaurant downstairs has two great happy hours (I believe daily) that make for a fun and vibrant stay. The rooms are very chique and the decor is neat and artistic. Walked to all major attractions or caught one of the free downtown buses. Alex the front office manager took care of us very well and I would definitely return as a result. In fact I am writing this review because of how pleased we were.

<Content>No Style, No Content, Just Noise The Hotel Max sets itself up as a boutique, chic establishment with the emphasis on style  a bit of cheekiness aimed at 20-30 somethings. Fine if you want to stay the night in an art gallery (a tawdry, uninspired one at that - which is a shame given Seattle's fine artistic reputation) but there are some basics that any hotel needs to provide before the extras are added. My first room, on the tenth floor, was tiny. My suitcase couldn't open fully due to the lack of space between the bed  the wall. More annoyingly there was an air vent attached to the building next door which provided a constant low drone that became disturbing very quickly. I tried to compensate by turning the a/c up but that just increased the amount of rumble as the unit is so old. The manager put me in a larger room across the hall instead. No air vent industrial hum here just excessive traffic noise from Stewart St. There is basically no sound-proofing in this hotel as my investigations into several other rooms proved - you either get the persistent drone of air vents at the back or juggernauts  car horns rattling your windows at the front at all times of the day.One last piece of noise pollution reared it's ugly head later though - the couple next door had clearly found the sex pack (condoms, lubricant, vibrator etc) available to buy in the room  at that point I discovered there was absolutely no sound insulation within the hotel from room to room either. For style  content go to 1000 Hotel on First Avenue - you get peace  quiet too.

<Content>SMALL rooms, no wifi but business center great A king-size bed in a small room made it difficult to place luggage and still be able to walk around. The bathroom WAS small and the separate wash basin with no counter next to it made the small glass shelf above inadequate. We have been in much worse especially in London so it was no big deal. We made a joke out of the logistics. It was clean. The additional charge for the wifi in the room was a turn-off but they had a virtually unknown business center room behind the lobby which offered two computers and a printer for free. The location is fine. I believe the pricing is too high for what is offered (I don't like paying for artwork and original designs). The staff was friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great Weekend at Hotel Max I planned a weekend get away for my Husband as an anniversary/birthday present. I had read the reviews for Hotel Max and while some were mixed it sounded like a fun experience. We loved staying here. We were already prepared for the room size as that was mentioned in many reviews that we had read. The staff was extremely friendly and allowed us to check in early (with no additional fee). The gentlemen at the door could not have been more helpful. They were very sincere in helping us with our luggage as well as calling for a taxi. While the room size was small the rooms were fun and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Paying for the internet was a surprise but not a huge deal. The Red Fin was outstanding! We had sushi and drinks and soaked up the atmosphere. The location of Hotel Max made getting around Seattle easy. It is a comfortable walking distance to Pike Place Market and most dinning establishments. We enjoyed the total Seattle experience staying at the Hotel Max. Individuals who like Super 8 Hotels would probably not enjoy the Hotel Max experience. We will stay here again!

<Content>The Max was just fine Stayed at the Max for three nights in early August . For its location and amenities offered, the price was perfectly acceptable, particularly compared to many of the other hotels in the area. The location really can't be beat. It's situated right downtown, a block from Nordstrom, and is a very easy walk to Westlake Center, Pike Place Market, and the Monorail. It's a perfectly do-able walk to Seattle Center as well. We stayed in a room with two double beds, and the room was certainly larger than anywhere I've stayed in most of Europe or NYC. The Good: the location can't be beat; the hotel's restaurant Red Fin produced a tasty breakfast; the selection of pillows, and the different, artsy decor. Only complaints: the really small bathroom and the thin walls. For those of you who are afraid of things that are different, or if you like bland, cookie-cutter accommodations which cater to bland, cookie-cutter patrons, perhaps you should stick with a chain hotel/motel.

<Content>Not so great at all! Initially the hotel looked nice from outside. The lobby was a lot smaller than we had thought from the photographs and it was all looking a little shabby. I was immediately put off by the unproffesional manner the front desk staff seemed to have. As we went into the lift a staff maintence worker came out of the lift, i dont mean to sound rude but the lift was small enough and surely it should be just for guests! When we got to the room we were a little dissapointed at how small the bathroom was honestly it was the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in my life thankgod we are slim people! When we got home one evening we noticed that the bed sheets looked unwashed we found hairs all over the sheets. We asked for them to be changed and they were but to be honest the new sheets didnt look or smell much cleaner.One evening we were stood waiting for the lift we waited and waited and still nothing! We asked if there were any stairs we could use as most hotels do have a set, we were then escorted through the unbelievably messy and horrible looking back office! I have never in my life had to do that in any hotel! All in all we really weren't impressed there are plenty of other nice hotels in the city so avoid this one!

<Content>Gay friendly- be forewarned On other reviews of this hotel, noboby saw fit to mention that this hotel is gay-friendly and frequented by gays. During check-in, we were treated to lesbians necking on the couch in the lobby. We were unprepared for this and it made our stay uncomfortable. The crowning touch was the intimacy kit placed in each room: 2 condoms and lubricating gel!!The decor is very modern with photo murals on the corridor walls and the room entry doors. Room decor is modern and attractive.Rooms are small (but functional), due to the fact that this is a renovated older building.The hotel location is great for touring the downtown and getting on the monorail to the Space Needle.An adequate, reasonably-priced hotel, but we never ever felt comfortable.

<Content>The Seattle Hotel Max From everything I saw on the website for this hotel I thought it was going to be a nice stay. However, once we arrived to the hotel I was surprised at a few things. First was the size of the room and bathroom. This is one of the few times I鈥檝e run into having a 3x3 foot shower in a hotel in the states. This is normally something done in small hotels in London or Paris but not common for Seattle. The rooms was also not much larger then the bed with windows that haven鈥檛 been updated for at least 50 years. Each unit has its own in window air conditioner which was appreciated. Also the rooms had very little sound proofing between each room which allowed us to hear everything the neighbors did through the night. For the price there are much better places to stay in Seattle. I would not recommend this hotel to a friend or visit it again.

<Content>Vive la Difference! Funky and modern on the inside of a gorgeous Deco period building. I was by myself and the room was just finef or one person. Let's face it; it's an old building, and rooms were smaller back in the day. If you're a McMansion dweller, you probably are better off staying at a modern chain place. I'll be the first to admit this place is not for everybody, but if you enjoy things out of the ordinary, you'll forgive the small rooms, especially once you lay down on that heavenly bed. Despite some sort of ventilation (for the restaurant, I think) right outside my 2nd floor window, I slept like a baby. The staff was beyond helpful scheduling busses to the ballpark, and suggestions for meals (I'm not much of a sushi person, so I didn't eat at the Red Fin). My only real complaint was having to pay for internet service, so I only utilized it for one day out of the 3 I stayed.Proxmity to all the must-sees and notable restaurants is excellent. A car is not a necessity unless you're going out to Ranier or something. I walked everywhere other than the ballpark and that turned out to be a free busride! I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.

<Content>overpriced, small, stuffy, noisy room The very trendy decor, good restaurant and great location did not outweigh the negatives for this hotel. Three nights in our third floor room were claustrophobic. Too much furniture was stuffed in this small, dark room. We were tripping over our luggage. The air conditioning was noisy, but when we opened the window, we had to listen to some kind of generator from the building next door. At night, we had to choose betweeen hot and stuffy, or just noisy. The room was not worth the price paid, up to $239 per night for a King bed for two.

<Content>Good place Room is nice but truly small. If you鈥檝e been to the Hudson or Marcel in NYC, you know what this means. We had the 鈥淨ueen of Art鈥?size. The description said suitable for a 鈥渃ozy couple鈥濃€攎aybe for one or two nights. We were there three nights, and even though we were out of the room doing things most of the time, it started to feel a little cramped. Go for the King room if there are two of you for more than two nights. Bathroom is nice and big enough. They could incorporate a little more shelf space without marring the design, I think. Shampoo, conditioner and soap provided. So is an ironing board and iron and fairly cozy bathrobes. Hair dryer. Room safe as well. Closet was big enough to fit clothes in without inserting at an angle, as someone below asserted. I鈥檓 pretty sure I had the smallest room, so I would not worry about the closet. Yes, the air conditioning is a window unit, but it worked fine. Flat screen TV only uses that 鈥淐oncierge TV鈥?that unfortunately more and more hotels are using. God, I hate that. At least Hotel Max managed to have the LOCAL weather channel updates--I鈥檝e been in some places where it was the generic weather channel. Bedside CD/Clock/Radio sounded good. Annoyingly for a modern hotel, no iPod jacks anywhere (not even the TV...I tried).Look of the hotel is interesting and agreeable. Art everywhere. Street noise should not be a factor unless you鈥檙e coming from extremely quiet environs鈥攖he hotel is on the not-so-noisy edge of downtown.Bar is so-so. Better to walk a few blocks to a place called 鈥淰essel鈥?for expert cocktails. Still, they allow you to take your drink into the hotel lobby if you鈥檙e a guest, so that is nice and convenient. Did not eat there.I paid $172 plus tax per night and feel it was worth it. I would go back, but there are a few other places in Seattle I鈥檇 like to try first.

<Content>Not for the Claustraphobic If you are claustraphobic or don't like elevators avoid this hotel. The room was tiny, but the elevators were the size of shoeboxes. And, to make things worse, there was no access to the stairs from the lobby floor. And, although there were 5 people in my party, they had booked us for a room with one double bed. They insisted it was my fault. Why would I have ever approved that? Only when someone else cancelled did they finally agree to give us a new room. Bottom line: for the price there must be better hotels in Seattle.

<Content>Nice artsy option The good: Location: 15 minute walk (or less) to Pike Place market, downtown; monorail ride to the space needle and experience music project (a must!). Great decor: Creative, interesting and fun with original artwork and photography all over the hotel and rooms. Not your sterile Marriott.The buts:-For the over $200 we paid per night, you should get free wireless (they offer but charge you $12/day for it). -Rooms can be on the small side with funky shapes.-AC is a wall unit - which is fine, but not quite as nice.Net result: We were happy with our choice - I would be very happy paying $120-$150 a night, less so as you get up towards $200+.

<Content>Great hotel--if you can stand a teeny tiny room! First, let me start with the positives: the location of Hotel Max was perfect--right in the middle of everything and one block away from shopping centers, movies, great restaurants, et cetera. The staff was courteous and helpful and the restaurant next to the hotel, Red Fin was yummy. Room service was ok, although service when dining at the restaurant left something to be desired. The cleanliness of the hotel and our room was impeccable. The bed was super, super comfy and so were the mountains of pillows. A small gym with a few cardio machines and some weights was fine. They also had a media center with 2 computers with internet access and a printer. That was helpful. The decor was edgy, funky, and interesting, although the door next to our room door had a life size picture of a very dazed and confused man with hat and a suitcase plastered on the front. That was strange, to say the least. What I just could not accept was the size of the rooms. Tiny does not describe the cramped, tight quarters my husband and I were squeezed into. We had a giant bed and less than a foot and a half on either side, and maybe 8-10 inches between the foot of the bed and the TV. With our luggage, there was barely any breathing room and I felt very claustrophobic. I'm thin and if someone with a bigger build were considering a stay here, forget it. Compounding the problem was the fact that the walls were painted the most depressing shade of dark gray/green you can imagine. That really brought the walls in and my mood down. It felt like a prison cell in some ways and the color was nauseating. I just could not get comfortable or happy in the cramped quarters with the depressing paint. The lighting was rather dim and the window coverings were opaque so you either had them rolled up so the daylight could stream in but ZERO privacy or rolled down so you got ZERO light and total privacy. The walls are truly paper thin and we could hear a lot coming through the walls of adjacent rooms and when the housekeepers started their rounds at around 8 or 9 in the morning, there was a lot of banging around and noises in the hallways that furthermore kept me from relaxing. It's not that the cleaners were making a lot of noise, either, it was just the thin walls. The bathroom was also small but super clean and well appointed but there was absolutely no counter space. I dropped my $200 hair dryer twice because of the lack of counter space and broke it. The elevators were also small. Four very thin people with no luggage and no shopping bags could squeeze into it. It comfortably holds two people. I'm a very picky person and would have given this hotel and excellent rating had it not been for the room size and the paint color. A less picky person might love it. My husband thought more highly of Hotel Max than I did. To summarize, it was not awful, I did love the beds and the high thread count sheets and duvet, but I'm the kind of person that needs more breathing room and something a bit more cheery--especially since it rained almost every day we were there. There's nothing that the staff could have done better as the hotel is limited with the lack of space of each room. It was a nice stay overall, but I probably would not stay there again.

<Content>Hotel Maximum Noise aka Sleepless in Seattle without Earplugs I chose this hotel to experience something different from a chain hotel and for its convenient location.Upon arrival, I was pleasantly greeted by the valet and reception staff. I was very happy with the corner room they assigned me. It wasclean, modern, but still managed to feel cozy. In fact, I liked it somuch, I went thanked them for the great room they gave me on the way back from dinner. I didn't even mind the constant rush hour traffic penetrating my windows all the way up on the 9th flloor - and I don't think another floor would have made a difference as there's only 10 stories to the hotel. But in the middle of the night just when one is sound asleep, between about 3 and 4AM, there was LOUD metal clattering the entire HOUR. This happened for 2 nights! I would think it was garbage pick up as road or buidling construction is ususally wrapped up by the time peoople are ready to call it a day. When I called down to reception early in the morning to ask for earplugs, they'd run out. As the hotel was fully booked that night due to it being all that was left downtown thanks to a conference according to someone at dinner, earplugs were the only choice one had.On the same night, a giant moth the size of butterfly - I wish I was making this up - decided to flutter around my room. When I called down to reception, they came up w/in 5 minutes to resolve the problem. However, management was not as responsive when I'd conveyed my adventurous night with 2-3 hours of solid sleep to him. His nonchalant reply was  that's what you should expect when staying downtown. How RUDE!! I told him that I'd stayed at the Pan Pacific which is DOWNTOWN (only 2 blocks over and 2 small blocks up) and the noise level was nowhere near what I'd experienced at Hotel Max. I wish they were classy enough to think to offer a glass of wine each evening to help me sleep. But I guess that was wishful thinking as he was barely apologietic. As I don't find sleeping w/ earplugs comfortable, I decided to wear my self out and not go to sleep until I was beyond exhausted the last night there. So maybe this hotel is better suited for tourists who tire themselves out from running around town sightseeing and shopping until they pass out.Though I loved the room, and the rest of the staff was great (including those at the adjoining Red Fin Restaurant which had terrific miso and seafood udon along w/ really fresh sushi on Tuesday night), I would never stay there again unless the hotel invests in soundproofing the rooms. After all, isn't the bottom line of what we're paying for at a hotel a good, sound night's sleep?

<Content>Creepy Wow. Where do I start? This is the creepiest place I've ever seen . If you like a giant red, plastic (?) check in area; a blown-up pic of a naked woman plastered on the wall upon arrival; dark, narrow, creepy hallways with an eye chart plastered at the end (what the hell was that all about?); a Campbell Soup-sized elevator with no access to stairs (they're for emergencies); a micro-bathroom and condoms and a vibrator in the bureau drawer, then this might be the place for you! Creepy, freaky, cold, unwelcoming, scary and did I mention creepy? I canceled my second night and got the hell out of there. I don't even like Seattle now. Yuck.

<Content>Max satisfaction We loved the Hotel Max! The room was small, but reminded us of Europe! We had a corner room with windows on two sides...one with a view of the courthouse and the other had a beautiful tree (live art!). Speaking of art...Hotel Max has some fabulous art on the wall. This is a trendy hotel, but they have given extensive condsideration to the comfort of their guests. The bed was fabulous...from the comfortable mattress and pillows to the fine linens. The staff was wonderful and helpful and gave us extensive information about how to get around Seattle and where to eat. Their fitness room was small (two treadmills, two cross-trainers, and some free weights) but we were the only ones in there...so might be just right for the demand. The attached restaurant was convenient for drinks, though one of their bartenders wasn't very attentive. The location was great....a few minutes walk to the market. We had to move to another hotel for a conference and were very disappointed to leave the Hotel Max. I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Funky Getaway My husband and I came to Seattle for a quick getaway to shop and relax and the Hotel Max was perfect for that! The location is awesome, it is right in the middle of the shopping area of downtown. The rooms are very small, the shower was a converted closet! But the quirky style and creative use of space make you forget how small the room really is! There is, of course, city noise, but we live in a city so we are used to it. Parking is valet only, the charge is about the same as any other hotel downtown. Fridge in the room is nice and the HUGE T.V. was fun!

<Content>Great boutique style hotel, awesome location A friend and I stayed one night at this modern boutique style hotel. We booked through hotwire. Originally we were reserved a queen bed but the hotel was able to accomodate our request for two double beds upon check-in. Our room was on the 10th floor and quite spacious, which was a pleasant surprise. Instead of valet parking for $25/day we parked in the lot right across the street for $17/day on weekends or $10/10 hours. The Red Fin restaurant has a good happy hour menu starting at 10pm. Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Nice, clean, groovy Based on reviews on this site, I decided to give this hotel a try. They were friendly and helpful from start to finish. I decided to call them to book, and was able to get a better rate than any published internet specials. I had a Queen of Art room -- it would be small for two people, but the bed was good and the work area was very nice. Everything was very clean. They have a few groovy touches, such as a menu of pillows you can order and lots of interesting art everywhere. I felt the soundproofing could have been better, but luckily my chatty neighbor did not talk on the phone all night or watch loud TV, so it wasn't a big issue in the end. The air conditioner would have probably drowned him out anyway.

<Content>One of the Best Moments in Seattle I booked my hotel stay at the Max in May. I decided to do a little splurge for a June weekend getaway. Judging by the reviews, pictures  location, I decided to book my stay here.It's a lovely boutique hotel that's perfect couples or single person. The bed was soft, warm  comfy with goose pillows; a nice-sized flat-screened TV  the room actually came with a Love Kit. I completely missed that part when reading reviews and it wasn't until I read a short review on the Hotel Max in a local Seattle magazine, that I found out the room came with this kit, plus a vibrator, wine for 2 people, design book  a host of other things. Of course it wasn't free, but it was on their snack price list. I got a kick out of this. For dinner I dined at their Pan-Asian restaurant the Red Fin. I enjoyed a tender, juicy, teriyaki steak with tempura onions  mashed potatoes  for dessert, tempura green tea ice cream. The prices were reasonable.The bathroom is slightly small and the rooms are small as well, but if you are not spending a full day in your room and it's just you alone (or with another) it's worth the money staying here. I would DEFINITELY book here if I decide to visit Seattle again.

<Content>Unique, Modern and Personal Once you stay at Hotel Max you will be bored with all the rest. The artwork, the music, the rich colors of the walls, carpeting, trim, and furnishings will awaken the artiste in you and embrace your soul. We began to feel relaxed within moments of checking into our room. It is like no other hotel, motel, resort, cabin, bed-n-breakfast, or condo we have ever stayed in. The soft, cozy beds, pillows, and comforters are the ultimate in comfort. (No scratchy, stiff, polyester bedspreads in this hotel. Thank goodness!) I slept better than I have in months!The hotel staff are professional, friendly, and very attentive. They rarely missed an opportunity to carry bags, open a door, or key the elevator for us.Small rooms? Small bathrooms? Small elevators? All true; that said, those issues quickly became irrelevant to us during our stay. The comfort, hospitality, cleanliness, and excellent central location to Seattle鈥檚 best venues undeniably surpassed the importance of 鈥榮ize鈥?for us. Hotel Max has a truly warm and unique atmosphere that you will not easily find any where else. The Red Fin Restaurant is a must, especially if you like sushi. But, rest assured there are plenty of equally delightful options besides sushi. We tried several small plate dinners and selected sushi from the daily fresh sheet including a special request sushi roll. Every item was prepared perfectly. The plate presentations were works of art. Each bite was more delicious than the last. Our taste buds were in paradise. The service is marvelous and the atmosphere is lovely. I can hardly wait to go back! Red Fin is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner plus they have a late happy hour that starts at 10pm and鈥?they provide room service to the hotel at pretty much any hour of the day or night. I believe the selections are more limited in the wee hours of the night but nevertheless鈥?if you鈥檙e hungry you have options.

<Content>Return Customer! Hotel Max is the uber cool place to stay if you want a different type of overnight experience. The rooms are incredibly small, the bathrooms smaller.. but it makes up for the smallness in atmosphere. I brought my son for his 16th birthday and he loved roaming the art halls, perusing the pillow menu and the spiritual menu. Kudos to Hotel Max for considering the the different flavors of each and every customer. The beds are amazingly comfortable and the room service is like lightning. We had a gorgeous Sushi dinner at the Red Fin that I would recommend to all. I had some glitches in my overall reservation and was contacted by the GM of the Hotel almost immediately upon my return home. Clearly the Max is interested in meeting the needs of the customer which you cannot claim for a lot of business these days! My only complaint is the daily charge for internet access when you can pretty much connect to wireless on the streets anymore.

<Content>Amazing staff, small but cute! I have to say, this is one of the friendliest hotels I have ever stayed in. I was super impressed by the front desk staff, the guy called Rock Star was more than greeting, he was fun and made me feel like I was a special guest in his hotel. I don't think I have ever had service of that quality anywhere. Even the valet who parked my car and carried my bags where totally sweet and attentive. If that is the working class of Seattle, I'm impressed.My husband was tired and not in a very fun mood, but Rock Star was so very positive that he had us laughing before we had even got the keys to our room. He totally took care of us while we were there, making us reservations at this wonderful italian restaraunt, helping us get tickets to a baseball game, and getting us on a guest list to see the a concert at the Showbox.The rooms are small but very well designed. The beds have to be the best beds I have ever slept in in a hotel. I took a 30 minute shower which made me feel like I was in a spa (sorry for wasting the water so much, but I needed it.) It seems to me that the Hotel Max is a gem in the rough. They seemed small time, but they deffinatly pulled it off right. It was cozy, and I recommend this hotel for anyone that wants to have a wonderful weekend away from the kids or has a speacial moment to celebrate. The service was sort of like one of those movies where some normal person wins a million dollars and all of a sudden has butlers and maids to take care of them.I'll stay there everytime I'm back in Seattle.A lot of little things were out of whack, like no robes in the room,

<Content>Loved staying @ Hotel Max! My boyfriend and I stayed @ Hotel Max for the weekend. We had a great experience! Staff was friendly. Loved the original artwork everywhere. We stayed in the Artist King room. The bed was extremely comfortable, 2 great nights of sleep! Bathrooms were small, but it didn't matter to us. Toilet and sink in one room, bathtub in another room. The closet was a hoot. When we opened the door, we couldn't stop laughing. The width of the closet was seriously like 4 inches! The clothes we hung had to be slid in @ an angle. Flat-screen tv was nice. We ended up using valet parking. Not too excited about paying $22 extra/day + tip since we only took the car out twice, but it was very convenient. Sushi @ Red Fin was delicious! Overall, Hotel Max was expensive, but we really enjoyed our stay there. We'll definately come back again, but probably when there are specials on room prices.

<Content>Nice decor but not worth the price Hotel Max has a great location, nice decor and good service but the price isn't justified. The bedroom is tiny (and I live in a 550 sq. ft apartment) and so is the bathroom; don't expect to take a shower without touching the shower curtain. Walls are paper thin but that's to be expected in an old building.Again, the hotel is decorated beautifully but our room didn't meet our expectations.

<Content>Details details! I booked this hotel for my birthday. I informed the property and I was greeted at check in with a warm Happy Birthday. Upon arriving in the room I was suprised to find a a few treats along with a card. The room although small was very modern and the bed was very comfortable. The room was outfited with a few romantic extras. The only downside to this property is the bathroom it very tiny. I kept bumping my elbows in the shower. All in all great customer service and I felt extremely valued.

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel I was attending a conference in Seattle and needed a hotel that was smoker-friendly. I chose the Hotel Max for its location just one block from my conference hotel. I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel, its decor, and its service.It is very artsy...not for the person looking for a traditional hotel. You will notice this as soon as you walk into the lobby. Security is excellent, requiring a room key to use the elevator. Each floor has a theme, with full size black and white photos on every room door, to highlight the theme of the floor. And there is original art in each room.My first room was very small, but innovatively designed. I would have kept it, but felt like I needed a little more space for a 5-night stay. The front desk accomodated my request for a larger room immediately.My new room was great! The windows opened. The bed was extremely comfortable, a newpaper was delivered to my door every morning, and I had lots of fun checking out the room amenities (I won't say more...you will have to stay there to discover more about what I am talking about).The restaurant was one of the best sushi restaurants in Seattle. And they have room service. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and eager to help. A gourmet grocery store right around the corner was a great source for snacks, wine, or other things to stash in the in-room refigerator.Above all, the room rates were very reasonable. I would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Forever loyal to the Max! I only have the most wonderful, glowing things to say about Hotel Max. The rooms are so stylish and comfortable- the bed was like a cloud!!! The staff are so friendly and helpful, the small exercise room is so convenient. I loved that the location was downtown and so close to the market, Belltown, Capitol Hill, etc. I would recommend a room on a higher floor with a good view. I was a solo and found the standard room to be absolutely perfect. I miss that bathrobe!!!

<Content>An OK place to stay but.... I would have to say that the reviews of the MAX are pretty much on target. LOCATION: The hotel is a funky rehabbed older property in downtown Seattle 鈥?a short walk to most places downtown but a good hike to connect with buses. The convention center is also nearby but not nearby enough. You鈥檒l get soggy going back and forth. Parking is VERY pricey. IN GENERAL: The property itself and the website portrayals are accurate. This is a boutique hotel (meaning SMALL everything) which prides itself in its鈥?very cool d茅cor and artwork. The lobby is hip and cool and the 80鈥檚 dance music on the speaker system brings a smile to everyone鈥檚 face. You can鈥檛 help but boogie down with the friendly desk clerks while waiting for the elevator. Services at this hotel are minimal, so don鈥檛 expect the offerings that you would get many at hotels at this rate.ROOMS: The pictures from other reviewers accurately portray the room. The bed, overall, is good on an even level with the famous Westin or Marriott beds. The mattress in my room was new and had a firm pillow top. Don鈥檛 take a lot of luggage. Rooms are equipped for two but the rooms are best for single travelers. There are no closets. There are small armoires. There was one drawer per person for socks, underwear and the like.CHECK IN: The check in process was easy as was making a reservation and the clerks didn鈥檛 bat an eye when assigning a King room to two men. Being respected like this is a plus when some desk clerks and managers at other hotels will refuse to honor the reservation or try to steer us to a room with two queen beds (how ironic!).PROBLEMS鈥ROBLEMS: The problems started with a lot of little things. First of all, I was assigned a room that was usually reserved for special needs guests. That was no problem, except for the fact that there is no bath tub. The bathroom is one large shower that happened to have a toilet and a sink in it. (This allows for easy wheelchair access.) When you run the shower, the water goes under the curtain and all over the floor. It even leaked into the room. After two days, I learned to roll up damp towels and create a dam around the shower. Also, the towel bar was sagging and about to fall out. In addition, housekeeping had a hard time remembering to restock soaps (two times) robes (several times) and other small housekeeping items in the room. Although the staff politely took care of things, it seemed that I had at address one or two similar issues almost daily. The exhaust fan was noisy - not befitting a hotel of this price and star rating. Some issues took repeated requests.The temperature control in the room is a simple window air unit. This unit is very noisy - again, not befitting a hotel of this price and star rating. When it rains, the rain and the roof runoff pounds down on the metal housing. As a result, you get the sound of water torture all night. I wound up opening a window (on the 9th floor) and straddling the windowsill in order to throw a hand towel on the top of the air conditioner. This got rid of the noise and almost got me killed. (ha!)The worst thing was that the wake up service was not working. I did set the alarm as a back up but it is very complicated and it didn鈥檛 go off. As a result, I missed my meeting. Advice 鈥?bring your own clock. I addressed with the manager on duty who promised to take care of it, but I don鈥檛 recall an explanation or an apology or even notification if the problem was fixed or not. I took my chances a couple of days later and it worked. THE BUSNIESS CENTER: When I was there, the business center was sometimes used by children who needed extensive MYSPACE fixes and IM sessions. THE FRONT DESK: The desk clerks were great. They were quick with conversation and a smile. They were always courteous and helpful. Hotels like this have staff that reek of attitude, but the staff at the Max was very welcoming and approachable.BREAKFAST: The attached restaurant is a popular place. The Asian restaurant offers breakfast as well, but the offerings are basic breakfast food at (eggs and hash browns) with Foo-Foo names at very high prices. Breads and pastries were greasy and were comparable to items from a filling station. The fruit promised on the menu was simply aged, brown garnish left over from the night before. The coffee, however, was fantastic and kept me coming there for breakfast several times. I am a glutton for punishment. If you are not a coffee lover, avoid this place at all costs for breakfast. FINAL VERDICT: After stripping away the pretty fa莽ade, and the friendly service, you have a minimum service hotel. This could compare to the motels down the block (*6th avenue inn, 8th avenue inn, Travelodge) at half the price. This place is simply a place to sleep and very much worth the standard 89-109 dollars charged at properties of similar services or quality. We paid over $150 a night and after considering the ups and downs of this place, we felt a bit violated by that high price. If you must stay here, try to find a better rate online or try to negotiate with the reservations agent.CONCLUSION: All in all, it was an OK stay. It was a safe and clean place to stay and we did appreciate feeling welcomed as a same-gender couple. However, now that I know the city better, there are places with the same level of service and comfort at much lower prices. Despite the welcoming staff and the cool d茅cor, there would have to be a serious upgrade in service, cut in price and/or improvement in the rooms before I would consider the MAX again.stayed: March 19-25, room 914

<Content>MAX-imum enjoyment! My co-worker and I stayed at the Hotel Max on a semi-business trip, we decided to share a room to save the company a few dollars -- always mindful to watch the company money! While the Max is on the high end (price wise) of what I typically pay when traveling for pleasure, it's still very competetive with other downtown Seattle hotels (priceline has spoiled me over the years, so anything over $150 per night seems like a splurge). We called ahead to confirm a late check in and to double check that we were all set for our reserved room with 2 beds -- seemed all was A-ok. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very attentive front desk clerk, who even went looking for bottled water for us! After experiencing a smooth check in, we were soon on our way to our 8th floor room. First impressions -- the room was far larger than I had expected! I, of course had only seen the one room, but complaints regarding size seem to be the norm for reviews of this hotel. The wardrobe was plenty spacious (I had taken particular note, as someone mentioned they had to hang their clothes at an angle -- if their room had the same wardrobe -- I have to question how large are your clothes?! ;)). One downfall... the room, while non-smoking and on a non-smoking floor, had clearly been home to guests who have yet to realize that CIGARETTE SMOKE SMELLS and LINGERS. I probably could have adjusted, but my co-worker is particularly sensative, so this was a problem. We attempted to switch rooms, but were informed that the hotel was booked -- we would have to wait until morning. In an effort to rid the room of the reek... we opened the windows, and that helped a bit. The beds were laden in white down comforters/duvets and loads of pillows... and let me tell you -- this bed put the Westin Heavenly bed to SHAME! Kudos x 2 on the comfy beds! The bathroom was reasonably spacious complete with the typical ameneties. Being a hip/edgy sort of place, the MAX has it's own line of bath products -- each in a simple white bottle with white lettering. There is also mimi fridge, wine glasses, CD player and a few CD singles, flat screen TV, two seersucker robes lined with terry cloth, a selection of teas and coffee and even a adult novelty item (for purchase, of course!). Another observation worth mentioning, I found the room to be impeccibly clean. I tend to notice creepy brown corners in hotel rooms and this room was creepy-free. Having just flown in from the East Coast, I was happy to settle in the oh-so-sensational bed for some Z's!BTW: there is a window ac/heating unit that some may call noisy, I personally have never met a heating and air unit in a hotel that wasn't! Also... when you visit a big metropolitan city, be prepared to hear a little traffic outside! (Kills me when people go to NYC or some similiar place and complain about the street noise!)The room gets 'A' grade!The following morning, we were assured that our request for a smoke free room was being handled, so we packed our bags and checked them at the front desk before heading out for the day. The hotel is in a good location, very close to Pacific Place Mall, just a couple of blocks from the monorail to the space needle and a straight shot down Stewart to the Public Market. It's crucial to note that there is a starbucks to your right -- and left, as you exit the hotel. My co-worker and I love to walk, so had no problems getting around to all of the sights. The MAX is also located just a few blocks from the free ride zone that allows you to travel on the city bus for free to the key downtown areas. Location gets an 'A' (although some may feel it's just a hair out of the way. We did experience a couple of hiccups when trying to switch rooms, but the staff was very patient and dilligent in making sure we were taken care of... they even offered us a bottle of wine!Staff gets an 'A' as well.The adjoining restaurant is a great spot for drinks... we loved the atmosphere, but did not have dinner. Overall-- I give this hotel great praise and would definitely reccommend it. It's on the funky side, so if you're more of a Comfort Inn kind of person, you may feel a little more at home elsewhere. I'm sure I'll return to Seattle again -- and hope to visit the MAX on my return!

<Content>A Very Cool Hotel If you're looking for a cool, offbeat place that also has a sense of humor, The Max is for you.The hotel location, design, vibe and staff are geared towards providing you and your significant other, (but probably NOT your kids) an artistic and somewhat funky place to get back to in between enjoying Seattle.Modern fixturing, tons of original art, a sleek lobby and hip restaurant (which serves great breakfast and even better sushi) left me quite satisifed with my pick.I did not find my room small as some of the reviewers here may have. But even if you find yours a bit cozy I guarantee it will be VERY clean.4 days at the MAX were all great!

<Content>Overrated My boyfriend and I were so excited about our trip to seattle and really looked forward to staying at this hotel -- the website and photos looked awesome and there were great reviews. However, we weren't impressed. Right when we entered our room, we noticed there was a big stain on the window (looked like someone threw an egg a while ago and nobody cleaned it so it just dried). The King bed was nice, but there was absolutely no space in the room for other stuff like luggage! My pillow also had a funny smell. The closet was so cramped you can barely hang clothes - I had to hang stuff sideways! Also, there is no parking, unless you valet for $25 a day. So we parked across the street in an outdoor public parking lot for $17. For almost U$200 a night, I'd expect at least some water bottles, turndown, or something else, but nothing really impressed us other than the neat interior decor (but cheaply constructed)! We'd definitely stay elsewhere next time.

<Content>Not a fan I spend 120 nights per year in hotel rooms so it is important that a hotel be welcoming and comfortable. The room (I paid for the most expensive one) was tiny. The shower was so small I couldn't get my hands above my head to easily wash my hair. The service was unwelcoming. The bathroom fan rattled. The heater is loud and is just a window unit. I stayed three nights and I just became frustrated. The art on the walls is great and the look and feel is nice but it's just WAY too small. If it were a $99 European hostel style hotel it would be okay. But, at $200 plus internet and $25 parking I just felt plain ripped off. Come to the hotel to eat dinner at the great restaurant downstairs but if you want a comfortable stay I would think twice.

<Content>great location, noisy, good eaterie downstairs We were upgraded to a 10th floor king room by Eric over the phone after booking thru Hotwire ( paid $ 125 per nite ), hotel gave it to HotWire for $ 89.... poor quality linens, Dell flat screen so so quality, bathroom needs a rug ( very cold marble floor), and window box style heat/ac was noisy, and had to be kept on since single pane windows are used, but it masks bigtime traffic noise below, the hotel is on a main street, so easy to walk to many places. The restaurant downstairs on premise had a delicious breakfast, also try nearby Lola's for breakfast/dinner. Front Desk staff is a bit green, need some customer training, often just stand there looking into space, or more interested in talking with each other than assisting guests. Bellcap was ok, but didn't explain the room's features like the included mini frigerator, or that internet is $ 10 a day with no free areas, or that most everything in the room, candy, etc is spendy, like $ 3.25 for a Snickers bar. All in all, the small room, and very comfy bed ( needs better linens, and using fitted top sheets so they don't come off in the night ), bath shower was good, but hot water wasn't there most of the time even after compaining. We had stayed here when it was the Vance hotel, it's spiffed up, but rates doubled too. It's a cheaper version ( in quality, service, etc ) of the W Hotel chain.

<Content>Really Enjoyed My Stay! I really loved staying at Hotel Max during a recent conference. I was there for four nights, and I thought the hotel was clean, interesting, and in a good location downtown. The rooms are small, as others have noted, and the building is old, but modern hotels are usually like this and I wasn't surprised. I thought my room (on the seventh floor, one super comfortable queen bed) was perfectly sized for one person. The staff was very friendly and the attached restaurant (the Red Fin) had several great vegetarian options for me. The only drawback? $13/day for in-room internet access, but that seemed to be the case at most of the downtown Seattle hotels. Oh well! If I could get a good deal another time, I would definitely stay here again, especially for a romantic weekend.

<Content>Great hotel but small rooms My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Max this past weekend (Feb 2007). The hotel is very hip  the staff was helpful and nice. The rooms are decorated very cool  I loved all the originality the hotel offers. However, the rooms are so incredibly small. We stayed in the Queen of Art room  spent a lot of time tripping over each other. The biggest disappointment was the bathroom....it was so tiny you could pretty much sit on the toilet and take a shower at the same time. Also, be aware, the walls are paper thin, we could here our neighbors like they were in our room. The location of the hotel is great, within walking distance of all the downtown attractions, restaurants  shopping  their Red Fin Restaurant located in the hotel was fabulous.

<Content>Loved the design, but the building needs an upgrade Stayed at the Hotel Max for the American Library Association conference in January 2007. The decor was really lovely, and I loved the art in my room. My room on the second floor opposite the elevators was particularly small, but having stayed in many European hotels this didn't bother me. I loved the design of the separate shower stall and the separate bathroom and the layout of the room was well done to make the room feel bigger than it was. There were bigger rooms on the 2nd floor as my colleague was in one. The plusses for this hotel were definitely the decor, the TV and the comfortable bed. The small gym with two elliptical trainers and two treadmills (all with personal TV) was nice and conveniently on the second floor.HOWEVER - there were two major minuses that really detracted from the experience for me - a very non-picky traveller:1. It was very cold in Seattle, even for January, and the only heating for the room came from an in window heating/cooling unit. Without the heater on - cold air did come in through the windows making the room quickly cold. With the heater on - the small room was so noisy that I couldn't sleep or hear the television with it on.2. The walls, at least on the 2nd floor, are extremely thin. I was kept awake at night by people talking/watching television in the next room and my colleague had the same experience being woken up by next door early risers. Neither of us are particularly light sleepers.So if you get a good rate - this is a hip hotel in a very convenient location. Make sure small rooms don't bother you and that the weather is warm - bring some earplugs and you should be fine.

<Content>great hotel I was really pleased with this hotel from the moment the my luggage was snapped up by the bellperson. I had great service from everyone there. The room was average sized with perhaps a little less room for clothes then some, but I really liked the trendy/modern furniture - it wasn't your typical hotel room. I like natural light and I appreciated that I had a corner room that was very bright as it had four large windows. The king sized bed was very comfortable and the room had a flat screen TV. The bathroom was a tad-bit smaller than some - when you sit on the commode your knees are against the tub/wall, but it was such a nice bathroom that I didn't mind - marble floor, tile walls and deep tub. The sink was pretty cool - it was mounted in this frosted glass shelf and the plumbing was all exposed. Plus there was a 6 inch wide glass shelf that ran the length of the bathroom. As I never have enough room in most hotels for toiletries I liked this. The room was very clean and I didn't hear any outside noise, though this may have been due to the white noise of the heater. I tend to avoid hotel restaurants, but I tried the sushi here and was very pleased. Plus, the happy hour prices on their food are a great deal. I was attending a conference and the location was great - easy walking distance to conference center and lots of downtown attractions. I never did totally figure out the bus system, though. I'd asked the concierge how to get to Pioneer Square and she printed out a sheet with several routes, which bus numbers to catch, where to catch them and the times they were scheduled to arrive. I walked to the stop and it had a map and a listing of the buses scheduled to stop there and the buses I had been given was not listed. One of these buses actually did stop there and I never did ask why it wasn't listed anywhere that I can see. This actually has nothing to do with the hotel other than to say you can trust the info they give you, even if the routes aren't listed at the stop.

<Content>Two thumbs up for the Max I read a lot of great reviews for this hotel so I had fairly high expectations going in and was not dissapointed. Yes, the rooms are small but so comfortable. I loved the comfy beds, fluffy towels, and a great shower. I even liked the italian coffee in the coffeemaker.The gym was clean and had new equipment.Red Fin was great. I ate alone and the service was very attentive. The location is very convenient too. It's an easy walk to the convention center and shops. Love the Max!

<Content>Style, Elegance and Beauty Leave the kids at home and have a romantic 3 day weekend here. I visited on business but plan to return with the husband in tow. I loved the bed and didn't want to leave. The service was excellent and the hotel is centrally located within walking distance to the convention center, shopping, local theatres and tons of restaurants.If ordering room service you have to be indulgent and try the gingered banana pancakes with coconut - to die for! I didn't see one other hotel in the Seattle area that I would have prefered to stay at.one warning: seriously leave the kids at home, this place is for adults only!

<Content>Go elsewhere After reading some of the reviews here, I felt I had a good idea on what to expect. First, the rooms are definitely small. Crazy small. Bathroom barely fits the sink and toilet and then there is another room for the shower (some rooms have diff. configurations, but all bathrooms are split up). Basically the room is a bed and long desk with a flat screen tv propped on it. However, everyone here talks about how great the customer service is, but I had the opposite experience. We got in late after driving for 5 hours from Whistler. Once we got there, the night manager checked us in. She didn't ask if we needed help with our bags or anything. So we grabbed their luggage carts ourselves (no idea where the bellperson was at this point) and loaded the cars ourselves. Then we got to the elevator. Basically, in order to get these luggage carts into the elevator, you need a degree in Geometry. So we're dead tired, trying to get the luggage carts into the elevator, and the night manager is just standing there talking with the valet guy or possibly the bellperson. Nobody even offers to help or do anything to help us. They just let us struggle. Unreal! I'm not sure where the customer service comments come from, but we definitely did not see anything remotely resembling customer service. Do not stay here. The Roosevelt (where we stayed before departing for Whistler) down the street is cheaper and ten times better.

<Content>Great amenties but tiny room! The room was lovely, but tiny! Very bright and nicely decorated with wonderful Aveda products. Service was great, very friendly. Great location near shopping for the price. Restaurant was also quite tasty.The only real complaint I have is that the walls were paper thin, our neighbors were living the high-life and stayed up very late! Fortunately the A/C was pretty loud so we turned the A/C on it drown the sound out pretty well.

<Content>Hotel TO THE Max! I stayed at the Hotel Max in Seattle for 4 nights at the beginning of November, and I loved it! I had a room with 2 double beds, and it was just the right size, and the bathroom was also a decent size. Note, this was the MOST COMFORTABLE hotel bed and linens I have ever slept in, all 4 nights I slept like a baby! The hotel is very funky, probably more so for 20 - 30-somethings. It is in a very convenient area, close to everything, and a short walk to Pikes Place Market and lots of other shopping, movies, and restaurants. My only gripe is the parking cost, which is $22 valet, just be careful that even though I only used valet for 2 nights, they charged me for all 4 nights automatically, so make sure to double-check your bill. Overall it was a wonderful experience and I am sure to be back!

<Content>Fun and Funky A truly individual yet high end place in a great location. Hotel Max presses all the right buttons for anyone expecting the Emerald City to be a little bit alternative but a whole lot welcoming.Stayed in a Queen of Art room which to be fair was a little on the small side (don't try swinging a kitten let alone a full moggy) but wonderfully light and super hip with plasma screen and hi tech bathroom. The vibrant ambience of the lobby and landings with all the art and photograpy is a cultural experience in itself.Will be back!

<Content>Service to the MAX I spent 3 nights at the Hotel Max in September 06, and found the service and attentiveness of the staff to be excellent. I had checked Trip Advisor prior to booking, so I booked an Artist King room for myself, which I found to be a nice size. The bathroom would be short on shelf space for 2 people, but that depends on how much you unpack.The everpresent, friendly door staff add to the pleasure of the lobby and the funky decor to make you feel welcome. Yes, hotel rooms in downtown Seattle are smaller, and I wouldn't be keen to stay in smaller than I had, but the location is fantastic, staff friendly, decor is cool and the asian restaurant is quite good (they do a great burger if you don't like sushi type food).

<Content>Plus - location. Minus - Small rooms and showers. Stayed here for business in early May'06. The location is very convient and easy to walk to lots of downtown spots. The front desk and door personnel were very friendly and efficient. This is a decent hotel and I found it to be reasonably priced.The room was a king on the 5th (?) floor and it was very tight, but the bed was comfortable and they offer a choice of pillows - nice touch. I found the noise from the roof of the next building a bit annoying, but this is a downtown hotel, after all. Unfortunately all they had was a smoking room and there was a mild odor, but I bought some room deodorizer and it seemed to do the trick.The bathroom was very sleek, but with limited space for toiletries. The major minus was the shower - I'm of average build and could barely turnaround! In the end I found it kinda of funny, but would have preferred more shower space.I would not likely stay here again, only because I would prefer a bit more space in the room.

<Content>Dynamite! This is one funky hotel and a great value for its contemporary decor. Like most hotels, Max has a price match guarantee . I got this room for $164.00 USD I called them directly and had them confirm another online travel site had an offer that beat their listed price of $179 on their website. All in all a great experience. Would stay here again!

<Content>Hotel Max.. Liked it My wife and I stayed at Hotel Max on our trip to Seattle during the last weekend in August. We booked the standard queen room thru Orbitz for $199 per night (parking was an additional $20 per day)Pros:VERY friendly and helpful staff, the entire hotel was nicely decorated in ultra-modern style, the location was EXCELLENT just a few blocks from shopping, the Public Market and Space Needle. Safe walking at night. Room was nicely decorated, bed was very comfortable, nice LCD flat-panel TV. Free internet browsing on the computers in the business center on 1st floor.Cons:Drinking glass left in the hallway by previous tenant when we arrived at 4pm and throughout the evening. VERY small room and even smaller bathroom. Musty smelling shower curtain, no doubt because the bathroom door is shut most of the time. Musty pillowcase. Noisy air conditioning unit. Very swanky asian restaurant/sushi bar attached to hotel, meant limited in-room meal options.Summary:Hotel Max was very nice and excellently located. Above average, but not excellent. Maybe try a room larger than the standard queen next time.

<Content>Good Location, but notthe world's biggest rooms. Location of this hotel is fantastic. It is very central to Downtown, and the market. Lots of dinning and shopping options are close buy. The rooms are very small. Basically our room had the king size bed and barely enough room to walk around it. The bathroom was fine however our shower head was broken. Once we let the front desk know that the shower head was broken they fixed it almost immediately which was great. The hotel room should have been bigger for what we paid. Competing hotels in the $200 per night price range have much larger rooms and are just as close to downtown.We also asked for directions to a laundromat as we had an extended stay and weren't about to pay the extreme rates all the hotels charge. We were given directions to a laudromat across Denny Way which was about 15 blocks away uphill. We later found two different ones within 8 blocks of the hotel on both on first and fifth avenues.Overall not a negative experience, however considering that the hotel industry is very much in the impressing business there was a lot of room for improvement.

<Content>Unusual (and Very Good) Experience I stayed at Hotel Max for 9 days during a conference in early June, and it was an extremely good value. The reason I chose this hotel was primarily price, and location within easy walking distance of the convention center. For the price, I don't think there is a better hotel in downtown Seattle.The hotel had fun modern decor, and the staff were very friendly, intelligent, helpful, and uniformly young (nearly all under 40 years). The rooms are quite small, (although not all the same size for doubles), and the room was clean. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the rooms surprisingly quiet. The bathroom was clean, and so modern that at first I could not figure out how to drain the sink (I thought it was malfunctioning), but a quick visit from maintenance showed I just wasn't hip enough to figure it out. One bad thing was that our shower curtain smelled of mildew.Some helpful and **FREE** amenities of the hotel include a very nice business center, and a small, well equipped gym on the second floor. The business center has a couple computers and even a printer for guests (internet service in rooms requires an extra fee). The gym has several quite fancy treadmills and some free weights.The staff was also very flexible about splitting our bill several ways (I was sharing a double room with two other people).My only complaint was that one night the television stopped working for no apparent reason, and the maintenance man was unable to fix it. It eventually started working again, also for no obvious reason, so I never figured out what was wrong.We ate in the attached bar Red Fin, and the food and wine were very tasty. The hotel has a nice location within walking distance from the convention center, space needle, waterfront, and Pike Place Market. Don't miss the nearby Palace Kitchen Restaurant and the doughnut shop that are on 5th Avenue. Both are yummy.

<Content>Let Go and Get in the Groove of the Max The Hotel Max is the spot where price, location, and funkiness converge in Seattle. I found the best rate I could get for a downtown single room at a decent hotel at Hotel Max. Sure, it's not the Travelodge, but I was hoping for a little upscale without breaking the bank, which can be hard to do in Seattle in August. The location is great, and I walked to the Market, the Needle, the ferry terminal and downtown restaurants and bars. Belltown is just a few blocks away, and Pacific Place is practically a stone's throw away. As for the funkiness, let's just say this is not your average, bland corporate chain. You feel like you are stepping into a music video when you walk through the front door. The art in the lobby is, well, interesting. Each room door has a different photograph and there was someething that looked like an eye chart at the end of my hallway.No doubt about it - the room was small. I had a queen, and it might have been a squeeze if I had shared the room. The bathroom is small with a miniscule shower. But I managed and decided to embrace the offbeat nature of Hotel Max rather than lamenting the fact that the shower was too small or I had to organize my belongings on the desk because there was not room to anywhere else. The bed was comfortable and I found it unnecessary to order another pillow from their pillow bar because mine was just fine. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the restaurant next door was not half bad for sushi. Try the Yummy Rolls.I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who is not afraid to try something a little new.

<Content>Stay in this hotel! I struggle to find a problem with this awesome hotel in downtown Seattle we stayed in for a night in July 06. From the moment we walked through the doors the friendly staff, fantastic decor and brilliant location blew us away. Recently opened the hotel has a fun and funky vibe, which might not be to everyones liking, and an amazing collection of artwork! The room was huge, and our every need was catered for, flat screen TV, selection of different pillows, fully stocked mini-bar and a clean bathroom. My only small complaint was that the room was a little noisy due to a nearby air conditioning unit at night. The hotel is located downtown and has its own restaurant which serves excellent and acclaimed Japanese-fusion food. We had breakfast in the restaurant and it was fantastic. Staff could not have been more helpful, advising us on places to shop and eat, and always with a smile on their face. If you have an opportunity stay in this hotel.

<Content>Great Place to Stay My wife and just drove in from Portland and stayed at the Hotel Max. From the moment we arrived, we were greated with friendly, professional assistance. The rooms were small. But very comfortable and clean. The location was perfect to walk to the Pike Street Market. Also good place to walk to the popular resturants in Seattle. Would definitly stay there again and would definitly recommend it to a friend.

<Content>Weekend at the Max My fiance and I stayed at Hotel Max during a quick weekend trip to Seattle. Overall, I would recommend the Max but hopefully you can get it for a lower rate.I booked the reservation through their website. I never received a confirmation email (as mentioned on the site) so the week prior to our arrival date I called to confirm. Their reservation line apparently doesn't handle the online reservations and transferred me to the Front Desk, she transferred me back to the reservation line. The reservation agent told me to call the Front Desk back again, at a later time, using a non-toll free number. I gave up trying to talk to anyone and tried my luck with email. I included a few extra questions about parking, check-in, etc. That same day I received a stock-reservation confirmation email with no answers to my questions. Not ideal but it was something.The hotel is great. The local art is a fun touch. There is a book containing all the Hotel Max art and artists in your room (it's for sale but you can peruse without charge). The location is also very convenient to many shops and sights. It's about a 10 minute walk to the market.The staff is very friendly. They warned us about delays with valet parking. Unfortunately, even with an early call to tell them we needed the car, we still had to wait 15 minutes in the lobby. We stayed in a queen room. It is small but not too crowded. Very intimate. It reminded me of NYC hotel rooms. It's a converted building so it has a different feel than the cookie cutter large hotels.The bed was great. A bit soft for my taste but we slept well. Negatives: The A/C is noisy and the towels are thin and scratchy. (The towels really should be upgraded.)Our total bill came to $257, this included one night of parking, taxes, and 3 local calls. A bit much for our taste but about average for decent, downtown Seattle hotels that weekend.Overall we were satisfied. We'll probably stay there again if we get lucky and find a lower rate.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! Since the Inn at the Market (another fantastic property) didn't have rooms during our final night in Seattle, we decided to try out the Max after walking by it while in Seattle. Upon walking in, you can tell that the hotel is definitely hip and different, in a good way. It has real style, with nice original art and comfortable furniture. I hate cookie cutter hotels and really enjoyed ths hotel. You'd expect the staff to have attitude, but they were genuine and friendly and always greeted us when we came into the hotel. The hotel feels very new, and clean and stylish - the rooms were big enough to sleep in, but you definitely wouldn't want to hang around in them all day. Bathrooms weren't big either, but I don't spend much time in the bathroom and don't really understand hotels that have bathrooms almost as big as the room. The rates were great compared to anything else in Seattle at the time and we'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Okay for the most part I arrived at the hotel late on Monday and was greated warmly. Although I had requested to have a fridge with a freezer in my room for medical reasons I was told that this could not be gauranteed. However, the staff offered to store my items in their freezer. When I had made the reservation online a kig bed was not an option. I mentioned I would prefer a king and was upgraded to a king sized room. The room was very comortable. The flat screen tv was great, the bed was inviting and the selection of pillows was wonderful. Not being keen on asian food (which is what the hotel restaurant offers), I asked for a reccomendation of somewhere else nearby to eat. The front desk clerk (who was wonderful-I just can't remember his name) directed me to his favorite local place. The Palace Kitchen was wonderful-great ambience and only a couple of blocks away. I highly recommend to anyone staying here. Overall the stay was great. However, the problem started the next day after I had checked out. I realized I had left a shirt in my room. As it was very hot in Seattle when I was visiting and I had spent the day in a business suit, I really wanted to change clothes. When I called and told them I had forgotten my shirt and would like to come pick it up they told me that that wouldn't be possible because housekeeping was gone for the day. They told me they would mail it to me. Well, that was over a week ago and I still haven't seen my shirt. I keep trying to call housekeeping and get no response and no return on phone calls. When I try to talk to someone else I get the run around and no one really seems willing to help.Although the room and stay were comfortable their lack of follow-up on this matter has left a sour taste in my mouth. I definitely think there is potential here for a great hotel, I'm just waiting to see it.

<Content>Terrific stay at the Max My husband and I stayed at the Hotel MAx when I attended a conference in April. I was a bit leary of the room sizes, after reading tales of small bathrooms (my husband is 6'3). We had a Queen room and it was just fine. The amount of nesting room available worked for us and the bathroom (no tub, just a shower, but a roomy shower) was ample for leg room, head room, etc. We adored the art and the photography on the doors - So much so that we purchased the hotel's book that includes all the art represented in the hotel. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but had drinks from very friendly and knowledgable barthenders. The front desk staff was great..... they really worked to help me figure out when Survivor would air! The only (tiny) complaint was when we checked out, the gentleman who helped us grabbed a windex bottle and sprayed down the counter before we could turn around to leave - Hmmm... did we have cooties??!! I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Great location and great artsy atmosphere.

<Content>Not bad, but overpriced I agree with other reviews about the helpful staff - they are always ready to help or offer recommendations, and the valet parking is efficient.Again, though, the rooms are extremely small - just a bed and a dresser, a closet and a bathroom. We decided to pay more for the artist king room because of reviews that claimed they are a bit roomier, but I can't imagine what the queen rooms are like given the small size of our king room! Perhaps we were given the worst king room in the hotel since someone mistakenly quoted us an extra-low room rate.The sheets were super-starched but the selection of pillows and the down duvet were very nice. The bathroom towels were cheap and scratchy, and the tub and sink are starting to show wear. The air conditioner has adjustable temperature settings, but the fan is always quite strong, which isn't very nice at night. On our second day our used towels were removed, but they were not replaced.The location is good if you're interested in the market and downtown shopping, but it's definitely not the closest option and you might be able to get closer without paying more. When you add up what the hotel does and does not offer, it doesn't seem to equate with the high prices. We've paid the same price for rooms at other prime location boutique hotels where the rooms were also small but they got the small things right (like soft, fluffy towels).

<Content>Loved the Max! Had a great stay at Hotel Max with my husband and 2 kids. We stayed in a King's Parlour room which is a little bigger than most. There was plenty of room for the 4 of us with the kids sleeping on the pullout couch. The bathroom was a little small, but large enough to do your business. The staff was amazing - very professional but down to earth. My husband was best buds with Adam, the valet/doorman by the time we left. The Max was right in the heart of downtown, within walking distance to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. We all had so much fun going floor to floor looking at the photographs on all the doors. There was some street noise as we slept, but that's expected when staying in the heart of a big city. We will definitely stay at Hotel Max the next time we are in Seattle. The atmosphere and staff made it a wonderful time for all of us.

<Content>Good location Just stayed there this week. The location is great and the price couldn't be beat. Easy to get to off I-5 and right around the corner from the shopping district. Pikes Place Market is 5 blocks (10 min walk) straight down Stewart Street (which the hotel is located). The staff was great and attentive. Get a local map from them and have them explain the area. Most of the town can be done simply by walking. However if you goto Woodland Park take a cab or drive. The hotel itself is very nice. However I found the rooms small and the bathroom basically the size of a small closet. If you are a large person then attempting to shower will be problem. The hotel pics are exactly what you see. The hotel is definitely worth it but like I said, if small bathrooms aren't your thing then I would look elsewhere. Enjoy!

<Content>I liked this hotel We stayed at this hotel for one night on May 20, 2006. We enjoyed it. Yes, the rooms are small but the bed is wonderful. We stayed in a king room on the 7th floor. We came in on the train from Sacramento and didn't arrive until 1:00 a.m. We had no problems checking in at all. There was actually a lot happening in the lobby and the music was a little loud from the restaurant/bar. There was no noise at all in our room. I thought the bathroom size was fine. We had a full bathtub/shower with plenty of room to get in and out of it. The staff was great. We checked out of our room Sunday morning as we were flying home that evening. When we went back to get our bags, we were met outside by a male staff member who told us he knew exactly which bags were ours and he ran inside to get them for us. Do yourself a favor and check out the breakfast menu there. We had a great breakfast. Originally, we didn't plan on eating breakfast there...it is a sushi restaurant after all. However, they had great breakfast items on the menu and it was all delicious. I would recommend this hotel but I do agree with other posters on this site that I am just not sure where someone with more luggage would put it. I would estimate that the rooms are about half the size of a normal American hotel room. However, the place is definitely hip and modern and very unique. If you are looking for something a little different from your average cookie cutter hotel room, check this place out.

<Content>Good times Everyone was terrific at the fornt desk. Yeah, you couldn't swing a golf club in the room without breaking something, but if there is just one or two people per room you're fine. Location is nice... walking distance to pretty much everything.I highly recommend it!

<Content>Sweet little Max Really liked the Max Hotel, but the room was quite small and we had some problems at check-in. We had called several days ahead and arranged for a late arrival. Upon check in, we were told that our room had been reassigned and the king that we had paid for was not available. After 20 minutes of haggling, a king sized room was made available for us and we were allowed to check in. The remainer of the 4 nights stay was OK. The bath is REALLY small. I did not find the desk staff to be very helpful.

<Content>Terrific staff at the Max I can鈥檛 say enough about the staff at the Max. Everyone, from bell staff, to housekeeping to management was extremely helpful and professional. They were just terrific with all of our annoying little requests. It seemed to matter to them that they exceeded our expectations. Other positives: I stayed in a double room with two other people, and found the room far larger than expected from the reviews on this site. I was on the 7th floor, even numbered room (facing Stewart) and was not bothered by street noise. One of my roommates requested earplugs (due to snoring, not street noise) from the desk and was given a whole jar. Free. Extremely comfortable beds and pillows. Really good in-room coffee, great bathrobes, a nice little mini-fridge (without those annoying slots where you get charged for touching something). My one complaint is that the bathroom was miniscule. There literally was not room for a soap dish. I travel frequently and have never seen such a tiny bathroom. As someone else on this site remarked, 鈥渇atties, beware.鈥?To that I add, 鈥渃laustrophobes, beware.鈥?I鈥檓 pretty sure I could have simultaneously brushed my teeth while sitting on the toilet and bathing my feet in the tub. And I鈥檓 not all that tall. On the other hand, how much time do you spend in the bathroom? So many of these ultra hip and groovy hotels (which the Max is) make you feel like an ancient, dowdy low-life for making the mistake of spending your money there. This is definitely not the case at the Max. If you want a non-chain environment with top-notch staff, close to downtown (3 blocks from Washington State Convention Center) at a very reasonable price you cannot go wrong with the Max. I鈥檓 looking forward to returning.

<Content>Chic but lacked substance If you're only in Seattle for a few days and need a funky place to crash, then Hotel Max is great. It's walking distance to downtown shopping and it's just off the highway if you're driving into the city. Funky decor, although I was expecting more art in my room - there was only 1 painting. Wireless internet access is ridiculously expensive, as is parking ($22/day)! Red Fin was delicious but expensive. The rooms and hotel itself are small... My knees would brush the sink when i sat on the toilet... and I'm only 5'4 and not overweight! But if you don't mind that a hotel w/ a pretty face and no luxuries, this is a good one for you.

<Content>Max was allright! Stayed at Max for four nights feb-mar 06. It's a nice little hotel with an excellent location near downtown Seattle and the congress center.Overall the look  feel of the place is really nice, if you like hip/modern/artsy. Since it has been renovated quite recently everything is new and clean and rooms have nice flat screen TV's etc.The air conditioning / heater was really loud, not something I'm used to. Had to keep it off while I was in the room, which resulted in a freezing coldness. Luckily the bed was super comfy with very warm covers, so I slept very well. :)Stayed for the 1st night on 2nd floor, that was a bit noisy, then I was offered a room higher up 8th floor, which was exactly the same room, except no street noise and a nice view of the seattle space needle!Some of the staff did not seem overly professional, but some of them were very nice.I ate three times at the Red Fin restaurant that is located downstairs, maybe I made bad choices but it wasn't anything special. Seemed quite busy during evenings, nevertheless. Took some long morning walks to Capitol Hill and found some really good funky breakfast places. :)Rooms are small, I would not stay here with a big family, but alone it was allright, maybe with a bf/gf also.There is WLAN that you can buy but I found plenty of free open WLAN coverage in the room that worked just as well. So save your money.For the price (115USD+tax per night) it was very very good. It's not super luxurious but it has a nice vibe and really worked for me!

<Content>The decor was great but there were other issues I stayed at the Max from March 3 - 5. I had two double beds in the room. The room size was fine for two people. The bathroom was tiny. You could never have more than one person in there at a time. There were three issues with regards to the hotel:1. You can hear everything that goes on outside. They need to have better insulation for sound. I could hear people yelling outside in the middle of the night, trucks in the morning. I come from a major city that has lots of noise so it usually doesn't bother me. I was up all night with the noise. 2. When I informed the checkout desk about the noise, the woman laughed and said they should have a sign saying no yelling. Not a very good response from a customer service agent.3. The beds were very uncomfortable. They seemed to slope towards the middle. I found some of the employees to have a little bit of an attitude. I really liked the stylist decor and the price, however I would not return to the hotel.

<Content>Most Fun I've Ever Had On A Business Trip This is a boutique hotel in downtown Seattle. Recently redone and very artsie. Each room had luxury bedding, soaps, pillows and flat screen Dell LCD TVs with Cable/HBO, etc. Cordless phones, Wi-Fi that works (Extra charge) and a great restaurant. I found the room small but comfortable. The bathroom was really small, but for a single person or business traveler, this shouldn't be a problem.Parking is $22 a night valet. You can save $7 a night by parking 50 feet away across the street in an open lot.At $113 a night I was blown away by the quality of the hotel. The staff was above average and despite being right across from the elevator, I got two great nights sleep!I'd stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat and wish that more of my recent hotel experiences were this positive.

<Content>Excellent I had a difficult time deciding where to stay in Seattle... I was in town for a convention... I decided to stay in a King room... My room was the perfect size... yes i will admit that i saw the smaller rooms and they are very small... but the king room is perfect... the staff was great especially the red fin staff... (Rob and Sara) they were both excellent... i would recommend this to anyone who wants a hotel downtown that wants a 'little different' experience... thank you Hotel Max.... if im in seattle again i will stay with you...

<Content>can't wait to come back! The Hotel Max was a nice surprise. After staying at the Monaco and other boutique hotels, I wasn't sure if the Max would meet my expectations, especially since it cost so much less. I was very impressed. The service was impeccable, from the moment I pulled up to the moment I left, the staff were very friendly and helpful. My room was delighful - loved the artwork, the colors, the textures, the views - a lot of thought went into this place to make a space to delight the senses. How many other hotels give you a pillow menu?? The location is perfect, and there is a bar and sushi restaurant right downstairs. Since the first thing I always do when arriving in a new city is scope out the local sushi joint, this was right up my alley! I ate breakfast there, I have to say it was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever had. The menu was very creative, not your usual selection, the service was spot-on and the prices reasonable. I would definitely stay here again, I just need to find more reasons to come back to this wonderful city!

<Content>BIG DISAPPONTMENT This hotel may have had a facelift, added some flat panel televisions and used excellent products such as Aveda, however, it lacked space, attentive and informative employees and customer service.  I was looking for a nice, better-than-average hotel to stay in on Valentine's night. When I found the Hotel Max website, I liked the modern feel and the fact that it was different. It was fairly easy to book online, however as I will later complain, nothing was mentioned as to 'extra' charges.  I parked in the garage and took the back entrance. There were no signs to indicate a 'valet' entrance, When I arrived at the counter, the desk person called for the valet and we handled it from there. At no time was there any information regarding the valet service, parking or any charges to take place. When I arrived at my room, I was not thrilled with the space in the room. Or should I say, lack thereof. Good thing I an not claustrophobic! Bottom line, I was disappointed to begin with, but when I checked out the next day, I was livid. There was a charge for $44.00 on my bill for PARKING. I had a guest and assumed they would be able to park with the valet as well. Again, no one mentioned, that there would be a $22.00 charge for parking. Not to mention the $6.00 charge for two minute packages of snacks!  I have stayed in some 5-star hotels. The do not charge 'hidden' fees. They are up front with their charges and it is expected when guests check out.  I am a local. I have a business here. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great Customer Service I found this hotel to be very stylish and clean, supported by great customer service. We had a slight problem during our stay(water temp) and it was resolved withing minutes and our nightly rate was reduced. This hotel is perfect walking distance to pike place and all of the shopping in downtown Seattle. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Pleasant Unique Hotel I visited some friends who live in an apt building next door to the hotel and their concierge made my reservation. I stayed four nights. I was very pleased with the room and the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. My room had a large king-size bed. The room had a nice flat screen TV, Aveda bath products, a mini-bar and great coffee. . The decor is very arty but not unappealing. As to the size of the room- I have stayed in much smaller rooms in Europe, where single travelers are treated very poorly in hotels. The toilet room was small but useable and the bath was roomy. The bed was soft with lots of pillows and good side lighting. All in all, a very pleasant experience. I travel alone (60+ single woman) and I never felt unsafe or insecure. I would stay here again.

<Content>Creepy! This is a really creepy hotel. Apart from the artsy decor which would appeal to a goth perhaps (predominantly black with hints of red and white), the rooms were very small. The shower was ridiculously small. I'm not a portly person, but there's no way an average American would be able to lather up in that shower. I was hoping for free wireless as a courtesy, but no, you may connect to the internet for a nominal (how about whopping?) fee of $12.00 per day. Thanks, but no thanks. There's a coffee shop (with a scooter or mod theme - I forget the name) if you turn left out of the front door and walk up the street past the court building for a couple of blocks. The coffee is excellent as is the service and the wireless is free! As for the Red Fin restaurant attached. I'd avoid it unless you want to spend some unscheduled time in the bathroom or you are a yuppie (in which case eat to your heart's content). The torte we had was cooked through - in fact it was burnt. Two carbon mouthfuls for $7.00! I sent it back once I could get the attention of a waiter which took a while - the place was virtually empty.The part that bothered me the most was the lack of security. I walked in very late one night and was followed in by a streetperson. To get up to the rooms you need to slot your electronic card in the elevator to get up to your floor. He obviously knew that if he got on the elevator with me he could probably find somewhere to crash out in a hallway or worse, try to follow me into my room. I waited downstairs by the reception desk where the night clerk was doing her very best to ignore me rather than calling security (if they have any) to escort the fella out of the building. Fortunately for me and unfortunately for the next guest to walk in... he got on the elevator and - yes - was followed in by the homeless guy. Ummm... ok! The night clerk didn't even bat an eyelid.I can't recommend staying there for the price they charge. The only good part was the location and in all fairness the day staff were very friendly and forthcoming with where to eat, what to do/see etc. which is normally information I'd get online...

<Content>Do not stay here This hotel was terrible. Broken elevators. Cold, drafty, heat didn't work. Was the coldest night I'd ever spent indoors. Called the front desk and asked for a space heater, but none ever arrived. Went down to the front desk at 5am to speak to a manager, but none was on duty. Checked out after a terrible night and switched hotels. The hotel agreed to refund my charges for the night. About two weeks later, however, I checked my credit card statement and saw that I had been charged about $350 by the hotel, including a random, separate charge, of about $4.50. It turns out they had never actually checked me out, so while I had been staying at (and paying for)another hotel, this hotel had still been charging me. Also sounds like someone maybe charged a drink to the room. The hotel was very nice about refunding the money, but it took a few phone calls, and was stress I didn't need after my brief and unpleasant stay.This is basically an old, budget hotel with fancy water taps and a nice bed installed. I switched to the Hotel Vintage Park, which, when you add in the free wireless internet, was basically the same price. Plus at the Vintage Park they had a free wine reception and a free port reception every night. Really saved on the mini bar bill. Most of all, it was comfortable, inviting, well run and WARM.Bottom line on the Max: Sometimes a bargain is no bargain at all.

<Content>Loved It! Great Time We stayed at Hotel Max on Jan 21st 2006. The experience was excellent. The front desk staff was very helpful and the valet/door staff could not have been better. We had a room with two beds and there was plenty of room. I see that several of the reviews complain about the size of the elevators and rooms.. I wonder about the size of the reviewers. There was plenty of room in the elevator and the room size was nice. We stayed on the bay at the Edgewater Hotel and I would say the room was the same size. Of course, the room there cost more than double what we paid at Hotel Max. I would also like to highly recommend the Red Fin Restaurant. The Sushi was excellent and the staff could not have been more friendly. This hotel is perfect for a couple or business traveler wanting to be close to everything downtown and you will even save a few bucks :-)

<Content>Max props to Seattle I stayed at the Max for 3 nights while in town for a football game. I had a very good time. Paid around $150 for a room with 2 queen beds. When checking in, I heard that rooms were going for as little as $109 a night. So don't believe what they tell you over the phone. If you are up for the risk that they'll be booked up (not likely), just show up at the front desk and ask for the best available rate.The hotel is old, but completely redone from carpets to ceiling, including new euro-style sinks in the tiny bathrooms, fancy shades on the windows, and decent 27 inch flat screens on the minibar. Lots of interesting pictures and art throughout the hotel. The place has character, but still offers a quality room that feels modern yet comfortable.If you want a fun hotel, try this place

<Content>Lots of postives - a few negatives.... I just returned from staying two nights at the Max. I paid $116 per night for a queen room, which for dowtntown Seattle is an excellent rate. The hotel sits right next to the Westin - which costs over twice as much. All the sights downtown are within walking distance.I liked my room. It was small but it had a Dell flatscreen TV and great bed. The bath was small but very functional and the Hotel supplies AVEDA toiletries, a very nice touch. Everything was very clean and well-kept.This a trendy hotel and not a place I would take my kids. I would say they are going after the same clientele as the W brand of hotels - the upscale young crowd.The Max offers Valet Parking, but they have an old garage which requires the valets to use an automotive elevator. When several people come for their cars at the same time, the service gets really slow as they can only take one vehicle up or down at a time.Another oddity is the stairway. It does not lead to the lobby. There are two small elevators, but as I was on the second floor, I thought the stairs might be quicker to get the lobby. The stairs took me to the alley behind the hotel. The Red Fin restaurant was excellent and had two happy hours - the first from 4-6 and the second from 10-1. The prices at happy hour were great - $5 for big appetizers and $2 for good beer.The front desk staff did not go out of their way to be friendly, but the valets were exceptionally well-mannered and hard working. The restaurant staff was very friendly as well.In the end I was happy with my stay and I will return to the Max on my next visit to Seattle if the rates stay where they are. The Max is an excellent value at current rates. However, if the Max, Westin, and W were all the same rate I would be at the W followed by the Westin.Chris
