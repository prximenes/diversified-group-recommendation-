<Content>Loved the Location I was warned that it was away from the city centre. My check in was handled reasonably smooth and the room was a decent size. The staff were very courteous. There is a market place on the other side but this does not cause any disturbance. The tram stop is just across the road and most of the sites are accessible quickly. A tram card is an important asset in Amsterdam.

<Content>Could not ask for more from a hotel. I went to Amsterdam with my boyfriend in September for a 3 night get away break. Upon arrival we were checked in by a very friendly and helpful receptionist. She explained everything to us in detail about the amenities in the hotel and was very patient when giving us directions to the tram line and bus stops.The room was fantastic, the beds were so comfortable, I had read previous reviews who said the walls were like paper. I did not hear anything from the rooms next door except the showers going in the morning. The only downside was the tv channels most of them were dutch and the ones that were in english were news channels. We did pay extra for the movie channels but the selection was very bad and all of them except 1 turned into adult channels late in the evening.Breakfast was not included in our package but we did go have breakfast one morning, it is a buffet breakfast and the choice of food is excellent well worth the 鈧?2.50, we were set up for the day.The hotel is 10 minutes away from Dam square and the tram line is a stones throw away from the hotel and it was only 鈧?1 for a weekend ticket for unlimited use of the trams and buses in the cities.

<Content>Great Hotel, Shame about the neighbours First the positives, and there are a few, which enable my overall rating of average for this hotel:1.Blue Tower is adjacent to the tram and bus stops, which take you direct into Amsterdam centre. They even sell tickets at the reception (eg 鈧? for a 24 hour citypass in 2008).2.Accommodation prices are cheap for a 4* rated hotel close to the centre.3.Rooms are spacious and well equipped.4.WLAN is free5.Public parking garage adjoins the hotel, and, if you leave before the attendant starts work, it is free, otherwise 鈧? per day.6.Some wonderful eateries and cafes are nearby.7.Very handy for access to airport, without traffic jams.Now the negatives:1.Sound-proofing is poor between rooms. Although not kept awake by audible friendliness of adjacent rooms, the keys turning in the doors certainly echoed when opened or closed.2.Local residents are victims of night time car racing.It was possibly a one-off, but the pre-dawn (3am) chorus of tyre screeches was a form of Amsterdam nightlife I could have done without (although once awakened, the visual spectacle of waiting to see a crash was entertaining if not ultimately disappointing)3.Night/early morning receptionist wasn't the brightest spark. When checking out at 7am to catch a flight, although polite, he was easily distracted, starting tasks for anyone who shouted, before completing service for current queuing customers. In his defence he complained that he had not slept all night!! (Certainly in my days of working night-shifts, that was always the point)In summary, if you will be awake all night anyway (or drunk), and not in a hurry to check-out, then location price and quality of facilities are top notch. If you want a night's sleep and an efficient departure, try somewhere else.

<Content>Could be very better, little things make difference I read the critics about Best Western Blue Tower, in Amsterdam, and yet reserved this hotel. In the check-in, I and my wife were located in the 11th floor, that has no elevator, as well the 12nd floor. You have to pick your luggage all alone, because there麓s no employee to help. I claimed and we were located in the 10th floor, no problems. The window was stuck and did not close at night, and both nights we stayed the problem remained, until 11:30 PM. The furniture was very dusty when we arrived, the other got better. Safe box was also stuck inside the furniture, with a nail blocking the door. However, breakfast was good. Despite being distant of the city center, you can reach a bus stop in the same block, with a very efficient public transport. By cab, we reached Central Station within 14 minutes (it麓s necessary explain to the driver if you are in a hurry, so go through the ring). In the day we arrived, the reception clerk gave us an indication about a night club completely wrong, cause the club was closed. Good points are the borrowing of iron and the hot-water bottle in the rooms. No refrigerator in rooms, but there are machines in each floor (if you prefer saving, there are two supermarkets just walking the corner, open until 10 PM). In resume, the bad points were greater than the goods. I do not recommend Blue Tower.

<Content>OK but nothing special We have stayed in Blue Tower end of May, when on the ground floor were still doing some demolishing works near the entrance.The room was clean, nice with very comfortable beds.A bit strange was a concrete column in the middle of the room.From the seventh floor we could see few very sad rooftops.All furniture and bathroom equipment looks all Chinese-make, upper segment but not durable/high quality enough. We had problems with the sink(water didn't drain properly), the shower cabin (let plenty of water out), TVset (no sound).Worth buying tickets/passes at the reception for the public transportation and the Van Gogh museum to save headache/queue later.The public transportation to the city is easy, by busestrams, the very helpful receptionists gave all necessary information.The hotel itself is not in a center of the city at all, and the market behind the hotel towards the tram/bus stations was a shocker with the very mixed crowd and mostly far eastern plastic stuff on display.The covered parking next door is a blessing as one should not leave his car parked outside in this area...12,5 Euro/night -if not mistaken- worth the peace of mind.No shops were open close by before 12.00 on Monday, not even pharmacies ... so it is worth to be prepared for this beforehand...We did not tried the 15Euro breakfast, we had it cheaper in the city.Overall OK, but nothing special.

<Content>Not new..budget hotel My brother made reservations back in July of 2007 for 4 of us. We were staying one night and taking a river cruise the next day from Amsterdam. The website implies it opened in June of 2007 but it was obvious, the building was not new. Upon entering our rooms, we realized we had no a/c. We immediately tried the thermostat but the a/c would not kick on. Several calls to the desk but still no air. They said they had to turn it on from the desk...it was computerized or something. All we kept seeing on the thermostat was a flashing key. One of the clerks came up and said that sometimes it takes 10 to 15 minutes for the air to come on. Amsterdam was having a slight heat wave for May and it was in the high 80's outside and the windows could not be opened. We never unpacked, so we headed back downstairs with our luggage as we obviously couldn't stay without air conditioning. To be fair, a helpful young woman at the front desk was apologetic and called around to find us another hotel. She found rooms for us at the Bilderberg Hotel, which was only 10 dollars more and 100 times nicer. When the taxi driver picked us up from the Blue Tower, he told us the owner of that hotel only ran budget hotels and didn't spend money on them. You had to use a card to turn on the electricity in the room. The location seemed to be in a less than desirable neighborhood as well. The Bilderberg Hotel was wonderful...quiet, in the museum district and the a/c worked perfectly!

<Content>Potential We researched hotels in the Amsterdam area prior to our trip and based upon reviews, decided to stay at the Blue Tower. We noted lower level construction taking place on the hotel and specifically booked an upper level room. Upon arrival, staff informed us that only first floor rooms were available. We looked at this room, which was large, clean and modern, but found it unacceptable as construction materials/work were right outside of our window. We requested a change and somehow an upper level room became available. However, this room was hot (air conditioning could not be turned below certain temperature) and noisey (from air conditioning units on the roof above). We again changed rooms and were provided with a lovely, large, and clean room. Some problems presented, in that the safe did not initially work (batteries needed replacement), the shower was a bit off and room phone not reliable (unable to call other rooms and two wake up calls were not received). After a long drive to reach the hotel, we were tired and these were problems we just didn't need. A reasonable morning meal is offered, which is convenient especially on a Sunday when local stores tend to be closed. Staff were very helpful with our travel questions and affordable local public transportation to the center of Amsterdam is nearby. Secure car parking is not available, especially on a Sunday when a neighboring public lot is closed. The hotel has a lot of potential and in comparison to hotels we observed in central Amsterdam, is a good bet.

<Content>Fab We arrived at the hotel very late probably a little before midnight. The outside of the hotel had metal railings around it, obviously a work in progress. But the hotel itself was very good. The Room was large clean and comfartable.The staff were very helpful with travel info and area info. Not alot in the immeadiate area, well a KFC, but for the sake of 2.40 euros u can get to the dam square in no time where you can find everything.There is one thing I must stress DO NOT USE THE CARPET OPPOSITE IF YOU HAVE A FOREIGN NUMBER PLATE!! We had no choice to park there on the first night as it was late, and we were not told about the one next door, our british car was broken into and the only thing to be taken was a 拢1.00 torch!! The police weren't very helpful and also a german car was broken into on the same night. Park in the privite one next door we spent 3 days there for 22 euros a very good price! Plus the hotel has a direct door into the private car park!The staff were very helpful in finding us a company to fix it and also arranged a time for us.Would definatly stay here again ... but maybe next time we'd fly instead of drive!!

<Content>Not bad After booking the hotel we were a bit nervous thanks to all the reviews. First impressions of the hotel were nice  clean. We checked in and were first given a twin room when we ordered a double - the receptionist was a bit snooty when i explained the situation but we did get our booked room. The rooms were nice  clean with everything you need. The first room we were in had a bath and a shower but when we changed rooms we only had a shower. Bad points: Our room had a pillar about 3/4 the way down the room making moving around one side of the bed a bit awkward. The TV never worked properly - we couldnt view our bill on the online systems and i would be wary about watching the free channels that you dont get accidentally charged for the pay channels. We had a problem with our shower - the first time it was used it leaked all over the floor. It was missing the rubber strip at the bottom of the door. We phoned to explain the problem and ask for towels to mop the water up. Eventually someone turned up and i explained the problem and she said that maintence would fix it the next day (this was at 6PM). We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and it was never fixed.We thought the area was ok but our taxi driver on the way to the Airport advised that it wasnt.

<Content>Wound up there by mistake... I went to Amsterdam in a group of 12 we had arranged to stay at a hostel. However due to an unavailability with the rooms we booked we were all transferred by the hostel to the Blue Tower and it was a wonderful surprise having expected to be staying in a hostel we would up at the brand new hotel.There were a few problems as it had just opened. My partner and I were given the key to a hotel room which was already occupied. The power was off so we had to carry our luggage up 6 flights of stairs, the air-con wasnt working and they had no fans left to give out. Though fortunately we were not in the hotel much so it wasnt too much of a problem. I found staff friendly and the breakfast was good. The rooms were nice as were the bathrooms.I think the group would like to stay somewhere closer to the centre if we were to visit again as the 20 mins in and out of central Amsterdam ate into the day a little...

<Content>Area?? Booked this trip via KLM including car hire. Read the other reviews and to be honest found the hotel itself not to bad. Sailing close to being called three stars though!No coffee or tea service in place. Only doing it the week we were there when it's been open nearly a year? No instructions for the safe and no indication as to cost - didn't ask.Room was pretty good even though we got one with a pillar in it. Bit odd. Nice and warm and clean despite other peoples views.Staff were very helpful overall and answered all questions and helped us out when needed - more to follow!Hotel boasts free wireless broadband in all rooms!? I managed to connect once in the room :-( Every time no problem in the lobby area - once in a week in the room. complained various times and they offered a room swap but not worth the bother as it was a pleasure trip. Different matter if on business.Parking!! Now there IS a problem. There is a parking garage next door but its only open 7am to 10pm, Mon to Sat. Out with those hours it's on the street and therein lies the problem if you have a car without Dutch plates. Our first hire car had German plates. Parked one night there and had two windows broken. Nothing lost as nothing left in the car. Only German registered car in the car park! Swapped it out for a Dutch registered car and had to use that car park another night. Sweated buckets over it but in the morning it was alright. Unlike the only German registered car parked there! it had been broken into.Not the hotels fault and they were really helpful with calling the Police. Unfortunately they were as bad as the UK police and could only make us an appointment to go and see them! better things to do on holiday - thanks.I would use this hotel again but not first choice. More central to town would be better although the bus and tram links are ok. if you do use it and get a hire car - make sure it's Dutch registered

<Content>DUFF witha capital D We booked a triple room and a double room for my brother and his girlfriend. The double room was ice cold, dirty and to make matters worse the staff were downright rude all for 129 Euro. The dutch reception staff were openly insulting us in Dutch, not realising that my sister in law is Dutch. We complained calmly and were fobbed off with regards to the heating. My brother and his wife had to complain again at 1am as they could not sleep for the cold. The night receptionist tried to argue that the heating was working but this was untrue. All we wanted was a clean warm place to put our head own for the night but this hotel could not offer this. We visit Amsterdam about five times a year but feel we cannot return to this establishment until they give it a clean, replace the reception staff and bump up the heating

<Content>Nothing special Stayed here as apparently the rest of Amsterdam was fully booked with conference delegates.The hotel is some way from the city centre - trying to find a decent restaurant took a while as there only seemed to be fast food joints or kebab shops nearby. Ended up at a really nice place called Podium Mosaic (an arts centre) which has a modern European menu (albeit all in Dutch).The hotel itself was fine - had a good night's sleep; bathroom was nicely fitted and the room was large.Can't really complain - this is just a bog standard hotel with a poor location.

<Content>Dodgy area Just came back from Amsterdam. Stayed at the Blue Tower Hotel for a week (business trip). The hotel is new and quite nice. Beds are comfortable, bathroom clean and nice looking. Breakfast buffet costs 12 EUR and there is pretty good choice of food, although after a week I had enough (eggs, cheese, ham, jam, rolls, bread, milk, fruit, etc.)What I didn't like was the area! I didn't feel safe coming back to the hotel after dark. There are no restaurants in the neighbourhood (except of KFC and kebab). Staff is very friendly and helpful. RAI can be reached with one metro (10 mins walk) withing 25-30 minutes (ticket costs EUR2.50) or by taxi (ca 20 EUR).

<Content>Below Average The hotel was decently priced and so my expectations weren't very high. Upon arrival in Amsterdam, I was right to think so.The rooms have faux luxury furniture. If you look closely, you'll notice how cheap it really is. I think IKEA has better furniture than what is used here. The beds are nothing more than 8 inch thick pieces of foam. There is no real back support, so if you are someone who needs a good bed, then stay away from this place. The windows in my room did not open and close correctly. The window hardware seemed shody and I guess the hotel staff didn't care to fix this.The Air Conditioning did not work at all. The thermostat looked operational, but upon adjusting it, we noticed the room did not get any cooler. On a warm to hot day, this made the room unbearable. I asked the front desk and they said that the A/C was broken and proceeded in blaming the A/C company for not committing to a day for fixing it. I guess there's only one company that fixes A/C systems in Amsterdam.The staff was unknowledgable and though somewhat friendly, they didn't seem very sincere. When asking for directions, they seemed to get irritated when we asked them to repeat street names. I'm sorry, but we don't all speak Dutch and the street names are fairly difficult for native English speakers, especially when someone says the street name fast. At 3am one night the Fire Alarm went off. Everyone headed downstairs for safety. There must have been 150 people waiting around in their pajamas in front of the building. Not once did any hotel employee come to give us a status or what was going on. After waiting a good 20 min in the cold, people decided for themselves that it was a false alarm and headed back in. Still- no employees giving directions or guidance.If you are more concerned with budget than having a nice play to stay then I suppose the Blue Tower Hotel is acceptable.

<Content>Dont judge a book by its cover! Arrived at the hotel and thought we'd got the wrong place as the outside looks nothing like the pictures on their website. However the interior is lovely with marble floors and beautiful fittings. It looks more like a 4 star than a 3. The bedrooms are first class with granite bathroom tops and mahogany furniture. The showers are fantastic. I think it was an old office suite or something before. Dont expect anyone to know where you are asking for as its brand new and even people in the area don't know about it. Its tucked away at the back of the Bos en Lommerplein square. Theres lots of building new apartments and stuff going on but you dont get bothered by noise and it is a very smart area with plenty of shops and food outlets. The hotel is situated about a 15 minute bus ride (no. 21 to and from centraal station) or tram ride (no. 14 to and from Dam Square) from the central area of Amsterdam but the transport in the city is excellent. Get a 1, 2, 3 or 4 day transport ticket from the GVB office at centraal station; its good value. They were putting the finishing touches to the place when we were there so it should be A1 anytime soon. Excellent, friendly service at the desk too but we never had a problem so I cant comment on how they deal with issues but they were very helpful with everything we needed.

<Content>A tax office that is not yet open!!!! Just got back from a trip to amsterdam, booked blue tower in March 07, through easy to book.com. On arrival in Amsterdam, we got our transfer to the hotel, our taxi driver looked at us a bit strange when we gave the address, but as it was a new hotel, we thought nothing of it, got to the hotel address, and it resembled a building site, no where near completed! infact our driver informed us only one month ago the place was a tax office, we managed to contact the hotel, who had made us another booking at a hotel further out, and, to be honest not somewhere i would have picked to stay. IF YOU HAVE A BOOKING AT THIS HOTEL, I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO PHONE THEM TO MAKE SURE IT IS OPEN, IF THEY OFFER YOU A DIFFERENT HOTEL, CANCEL AND BOOK YOUR OWN!
