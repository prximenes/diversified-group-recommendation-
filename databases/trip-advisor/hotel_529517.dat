<Content>You should definitely stay here... This is a great value stylish hotel with a relaxed friendly atmosphere. Although it is situated in a somewhat residential area it is only a short walk to the nearby U-Bahn station or bus stop. Kreuzberg and Mitte are within easy reach. The staff here are very helpful with travel advice. We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and as our room was not ready the lovely receptionist made both my wife and I cappuccinos and looked after our luggage.. We were offered access to the lounge with free internet and also invited to join breakfast. After a couple of hours exploring the surrounding area, we returned to check in to a fantastic room. Very clean with an extremely comfortable bed (strange, I never thought I liked those foam mattresses..) and nice minimalistic modern furnishings. Beautiful brick arched ceilings and a heated floor in the bathroom. Very good  typically German breakfast spread, meat, cheese, cereals, breads, pickles, eggs etc.. The staff were always welcoming and friendly. After our departure, I realised I'd left something behind. The hotel promptly emailed me back and had it in the post to the next hotel on our European holiday free of charge. We stayed 2 nights as part of our honeymoon and will definitely be returning on our next visit to Berlin. Also, if you like sushi I definitely recommend that you go to Kuchi in nearby Mitte. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>A lovely hotel with great staff... It's good to see a few minor complaints from some of the more recent reviewers. They are valid. Still and all, this hotel is a really nice place.The buffet breakfast is fabulous but don't expect hot food (no omelettes, bacon or oatmeal) and no croissants but otherwise the buffet has a great variety of choices: hams, sausages, cheeses, yogurt, cold cereals, boiled eggs, fruit and vegetable salads, meat salads,lox and breads and rolls. The dining room is lovely with a nice garden to sit in or look out on.The owners/staff are very friendly and helpful. They obviously enjoy running the hotel and are very efficient. The place has a nice, personal feel about it.We stayed in room 404. This is one of the 2 rooms with a balcony. The balcony is large enough to sit on and there is a table and chairs.The room was spacious and splotless and I loved the heated bathroom floors. The problem regarding the bathroom doors is something to consider depending on your habits. My husband likes to take late night showers/baths and the light coming through the doors can be a little annoying. Also, no tubs (and I do like to soak in a tub) but the shower was excellent with plenty of pressure and hot water. I can see what others mean about the bath facing the room and the possible lack of privacy but this didn't bother us (after more than 25 years of marriage, it better not).The beds were not luxury beds and yet, they were very comfortable and we slept soundly. I liked the big square pillows. They were easy to plump up and shape into whatever was most comfortable. I asked for an extra blanket and pillow and that was quickly supplied.The other issue regarding location is one that depends on your preferences. We like to walk and didn't therefore find the hotel too far from anything. I agree that it might make some people a little uneasy to walk back to the hotel at night. The street is safe but Berlin,( in general, not just on this street), is dimly lit at night (in fact, it seemed to me to be the most dimly lit of all the cities I've visited in Europe--perhaps a factor of the green status of this city)

<Content>Styish The hotel is very clean, modern and stylish and staff were very friendly i.e. we were given a map of the city straight away (which was far better than those in the guide books) and pointed in the direction of some nice restaurants.The hotel's appearance was very clean and the decor minimal but classy. Although our room was very nice it is not for the toilet shy i.e. the toilet was just short of open plan.The location was not the most central but it's only a few U bahn stops from the city centre. My girlfriend did comment however she would not have liked to travel to and from the hotel in the evening had she been alone or in a group of women only.Overall, we had a really enjoyable stay in a very nice hotel with more warmth than you would get in a chain and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Just OK We stayed in the Johann for some days. To be honest, after reading the existing reviews, I was prepared for something more special than what we experienced. Pros: Modern and clean room, nice building, quiet area.Floor-heated bathroom.Friendly owners.Cons: Toilet glass door doesn't close firmly (it's a slide door that leaves 2-3cm gaps on each side, so the smell and ...noise may come out in the main room. Shower cable was broken, throwing water around. There's not a personal safe in the room, only downstairs at the reception. Breakfast was good but I think it's rather continental than real buffet breakfast (no toast bread, scrambled eggs, bacon, croissants). The beds were definitely not so good as reviewed form others and the pillars were huge and square, but difficult to shape at a healthy sleeping position.Finally, I think I expected a bit more for almost 100 euros/day.I would prefer to pay a bit more and stay at a more central hotel next time.

<Content>My best experience in Berlin! I stayed at the Johann for 5 days and I have to agree with all the positive reviews. The hotel is great value, clean, beautiful, quiet and the staff and service are warm and caring. I already miss looking forward to a great breakfast every morning. On a final note my partner said the bed was the most comfortable he has ever slept in. I cannot fault this place, in fact it is unthinkable to stay somewhere else next time I am in Berlin.

<Content>Great Hotel in Berlin I was very pleased with my week long stay at the Johann Hotel. The hotel is situated on a very quiet street with a short walk to public transportation. The hotel itself was lovely - the public areas and rooms were spotless, the decor was modern, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet that was included in the price of the room was out of this world and was just what you needed before hitting the streets of Berlin. An assortment of cheeses, meats, salmon, fresh bread, fruit, vegetables,yogurt and cereal awaited you each morning. The breakfast room was huge, stylish and filled with relaxing music. The area surrounding the hotel was residential so you had access to a nice supermarket as well as a couple of late night delicious food stands by the public transportation. A great stop after a night out! It's easy to get to all areas from Berlin from this section of the city. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would suggest it to anyone! The price is unbelievable for the quality of this hotel!

<Content>Excellent experience This was a lovely, welcoming home for 5 nights. We found it to be spotless, roomy, comfortable, and well-appointed. Our room was large enough to enjoy a sofa, and the wood flooring, vaulted brick ceilings, and heated bathroom tile floor were beautiful. The owners and staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. The lobby living room offered drinks, coffee, and conversation.

<Content>Fantastic base for a long weekend in Berlin This is an excellent hotel in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin. Like the previous review I was here when part of the U1 U-bahn line was closed for engineering work, but it reopens at the end of October. However, the hotel is a five to ten minute walk from at least three different U-bahn stations, so this wasn't a problem.It in a very nice setting, close to, but not overlooking a nearby canal. The area is mainly a quiet residential district. I had a single room, which was on the small side, but was very very comfortable and the very high ceilings and large bed made the room feel larger. The bathroom, very clean and modern, was a good size, given the overall proportions of the room.Staff were very friendly and helpful. They clearly enjoy running the hotel, which makes this well run, affordable, independent hotel. Breakfast selection excellent as well.Well worth staying here, as it helps explore some of the districts away from Mitte, where you can find some great bars and restaurants, favoured by locals.

<Content>All the good reviews are right! Can't really add much to the reviews that are already about this place.Our stay was excellent. There was engineering works on the U1 line whilst we were there but I'd recommend that you use Hallesches Tor on the U6 line anyway. It is just as close and a pleasant short walk.We had room 304 which was large and airy. It is at the front of the building and when we opened our windows, it was initially quite noisy when cars went past on the 'cobbled' street. It is a quiet road though and it never stopped us getting to sleep.Breakfast was superb in a lovely room. The staff are always busying around to make sure there is always lots of everything. Didn't have to use the reception much but the people were always polite and friendly.We also went down to Bergmanstrasse to eat - another pleasant stroll south. A tip - if you go to Pagode, a Thai restaurant which is definitely recommended, collect your own food - it is effectively a takeaway with lots of tables. Order and wait or come back very quickly.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Hotel Johann is a really great hotel - the breakfast is fantastic, the rooms are clean and modern and a great size with fab bathrooms. It is in a more residential area but close to the subway which you will need to use if visiting Berlin (its very cheap, efficient and easy to navigate) but the area was no problem - I guess it's worth mentioning if you want to be right in the centre where the museums and galleries are. I will definitely stay here again and heartily recommend it on price, venue and facilities (breakfast, spa, small bar, minibar, bikes available and outside seating). Stay here!!

<Content>An excellent choice This is a really friendly, quiet hotel. I concur with everything other positive reviewers have described. The breakfasts are exceptional and the staff incredibly helpful. There is an excellent Italian reastuarant if you turn right and right again which is cheap but delicious. I can thoroughly recommend a stay here. There is a swimming pool adjacent to the station, no idea of the quality but it may be worth packing your trunks and finding out. I can also recommend the circular boat trip which departs just a short walk from the hotel.

<Content>Great value for money I was in Berlin for 10 days and thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Johann Hotel. Great breakfasts, lovely room (although I booked one of the small ones), and the service was impeccable. I recommend it without hesitation. You can also rent a bike at a very cheap rate, but make sure you reserve it in advice because they only have 3 available.

<Content>Loved it! I stayed at Hotel Johann for almost a week during the chilly Berlin Winter. Overall I had a great experience staying here and would definitely do so again. Staff were very pleasant and helpful, my room was impeccably clean with great minimalist decor and the underfloor bathroom heating was a plus. The hotel is off the main tourist track, but close to a selection of good Kreuzberg cafes/shops, also near many public transport options. I rented a bicycle from the Hotel during my stay, which was a great option (only charged me 3 out of my 4 days rental, a nice touch!). Berlin is a wonderful city for cycling and although Hotel Johann is out of the city centre, this made everything very accessible. Good breakfast choices in a pleasant environment, wireless internet access, cosy yet spacious room, beds could be slightly more substantial, though definitely a great choice overall, good value too!

<Content>Perfect little hideaway! A super little place in a quiet neighbourhood and within easy access of two useful U-Bahn lines. It's a little off the beaten track but it's easy to get pretty much anywhere. A cab from Tegal costs just under éˆ§?0 and it's under éˆ§?0 to the funky areas of Mitte if you're coming back late. The room was beautifully furnished, peaceful and airy with a tasteful and spotless en-suite shower room. The highlight though was breakfast. We ate in the lovely bright, airy dining room three days on the trot - they serve breakfast 'til 11 at weekends. Stunning selection of bread rolls, cooked meats, smoked salmon and a lovely array of cheese. Fresh coffee and quality juice choices abound. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A gem I chose this place based on tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed! I booked 4 rooms for a small group, and they were slightly different but all impeccable in their minimalist style, and with a lot of attention to detail. The German style beds (two single together, no doubles) were comfortable, and the frosted glass door to the bathroom was not a problem for privacy. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the included breakfast in the nice dining room was delicious. As others said, the area is safe and quiet (the slightly messier area is around Moritzplatz underground station, but you don't need to go there). Last but not least, we weren't charged a single penny upon reservation or check-in. We paid the whole balance at check-out, and cash payments had 3% discount.

Bright and clean, close to the metro station Hallesche Tor and Gneisenauer Straè„½e. You can walk downtown (just follow the Friedrichstraè„½e from the subway stn Hallesche Tor) in about 30minutes.

<Content>Adorable little hotel Date: 8 May 2008Reviewer: Tania - GreeceWe stayed there for 4 days. It is a superbly clean, quiet and stylish hotel, not exactly in the heart of Berlin, but very comfortably located (the nearest metro and bus station are a 5 minute walk away, through a lovely park, along a river canal). Safe and absolutely non touristic area. Just across the hotel there is one of the finest german restaurants (Altes Zollhaus). The room was pretty spacious, very clean and pretty. The glass bathroom door is not highly recommended for new couples, as it may cause some embarassment..... It also had a small balcony, which for us smokers was pretty useful. The hotel has a very cosy breakfast room (where you should not expect scrambled eggs and bacon, although everything that is offered is fresh and delicious) and also a very nice backyard, where you can take your breakfast, if the weather is good. The owners are simply adorable, extremely polite, but in a relaxed and casual manner and always ready to make you feel you are more than welcome, almost part of a big bunch of friends. I loved it!! You will too, if you fancy small hotels with a relaxed atmosphere and a casual but absolutely professional attitude.

<Content>Great hotel in a great city We stayed at the Hotel Johann for 3 nights, on a bed and breakfast basis. We chose it mainly because of the good reviews on Trip Advisor but also because the price was reasonable and it looked nice on the website. To get there from Berlin-Schonefeld, take the éˆ¥æ¥¢irport Expresséˆ¥?to Friedrichstrasse, then the U6 to Hallesches Tor (direction Alt-Mariendorf). The hotel is 5-10 mins walk from Hallesches Tor, on a quiet residential street. The whole journey took an hour éˆ¥?but I would allow 90 mins in case of missing connections etc éˆ¥?check-in is available until midnight.On arrival, we were greeted by a very helpful staff member who spoke very good English (a godsend considering our poor skills in German). We were in our room within minutes éˆ¥?after stopping to get some reasonably priced drinks from the honesty bar in the hallway. Our room was just as we had hoped it would be éˆ¥?spacious and comfortable with lovely furnishings. The bathroom had a sliding glass door which gives no soundproofing whatsoever, so itéˆ¥æªš definitely best to stay here with someone you know well! We didnéˆ¥æª› realise that the bathroom floor was supposed to be heated éˆ¥?this must have been what the thermostat in the bathroom was for (we thought it was for the room itself). The bed was an éˆ¥æ¥¢ustrian twinéˆ¥?éˆ¥?two single mattresses on a double frame and was very comfy. We werenéˆ¥æª› so keen on the feather pillows éˆ¥?but thatéˆ¥æªš just personal preference I guess. The central heating worked fine when needed and the windows were easy to operate and provided good soundproofing. There is no air conditioning though éˆ¥?hopefully the high ceilings would compensate for this in the summer months.Although others have praised the selection of food for breakfast, we found it a little bit disappointing. The breakfast room itself is really nice and you can eat in the courtyard when the weather is good. The food available included cereals, bread, cheese, ham, cold veg, fruit salad and yoghurt. There may have been 10 different types of bread but we were hoping for some hot food or at least some éˆ¥æ¦®weetéˆ¥?items such as croissants, pain au chocolat etc. The other guests seemed to be happy though so I guess this just comes down to cultural differences (although I donéˆ¥æª› remember having any problems with breakfasts when we went to Austria).Overall, we were really pleased with this hotel and it is highly likely that we will stay here again if we go back to Berlin. The location may seem quite far from the centre of Berlin, but the proximity of the U-Bahn makes travelling around very easy. One useful point to note is that they are currently offering a 3% discount for cash payments éˆ¥?there are ATMs in the shops near Hallesches Tor.

<Content>Good choice Booked the Hotel Johann after reading the good reviews on tripadvsor and havenéº“t been disappointed.The area is absolutely non-touristic which we liked and has good links to the U-Bahn and busses.Our standart room was very clean and minimalisitc; the glass bathroom door is probably not one of the best features but the heated bathroom floor makes up for that. The major plus was the extremely nice breakfast buffet and the relaxed, non-hotel-like feeling in the building. We liked it and probably will stay there again!

<Content>Wonderful stay My family and I stayed at Johann during recent Easter holidays.We can in principle confirm the comments of previous travellers.The hotel is located in Kreuzberg, not very close to the City center, but with very good connections, both by U-Bahn and bus (line M41 to Potsdamer Platz is just 200 m from he hotel).The area is very quiet, giving you the chance to take very good rest in the night.Hotel is modern and very clean; the staff is absolutely kind, available and helpful, paying full attention to any of your request.Our room was very warm, wide and confortable; the floor of the bathroom was heated, which gave us a very nice feeling, when we were back from our museums tour, since the wheater was quite cold in those days.The breakfast room was wide, with a view to the garden behind the hotel; the choice of the food was wide, with many types of cheese, salame, ham, salmon, fruit, and more.The ratio quality/price is definitely high.We'll surely stay at Johann again once in Berlin and we'd recommend the hotel to anyone.

<Content>Classy, Convenient and Affordable Just south of the main tourist loop, 10 minutes from Checkpoint Charlie, five minutes from the U-bahn, Johann Hotel is a good deal for the price. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The hotel is comfortable, quiet and very low-stress. The included-breakfasts are a great start before a long day hiking around. The only downside are the very European beds -- two hardwood singles pushed together with a thin mattress. The rooms are clean, the bathtubs are huge and the bathroom floors are heated. Definitely recommend this place.

<Content>Great place to stay Small hotel in the Kreuzberg area and apparently a free parking in the streets around the hotel. Very amazing for a big city like Berlin.Very helpfull and friendly staff, spacious and very clean room, we really like our stay (2 adults 2 kids.) The breakfast was also very tastefull.The hotel is situated about 1000 yards from the subway station, the neighbourhood is safe and very quiet. For our next trip to Berlin we will definitely come back to this hotel.

<Content>Superb Value! Our family was attending a wedding in Berlin. We decided to book at the Johann because several other family members were planning to stay there. Normally we stay in more upscale hotels, but we felt that it was more important to stick with the family. Our concerns about the quality were totally needless. The place is a first class operation. The beds are fabulous--this comes from someone with a really bad back who always complains about hotel beds, no matter the class of hotel--and we have stayed at the best. The rooms are spare and modern, and most importantly spotless with crisp linens. The heated bathroom floor is a rare treat. The breakfast room is lovely and so is the food. The staff is friendly and helpful--what else can you ask of a hotel? Well, location, perhaps. It is a bit out of the way, but if you use public transportation or taxis you are within striking distance to all important sites. Best of all--you are walking distance to the magnificent Jewish Museum which is worth a trip to Berlin all by itself.

<Content>A stylish spot away from the crowds We chose Hotel Johann based on the strength of the other reviews listed here and were not disappointed. Situated on a quiet residential street in Kreuzberg, the hotel is about a 10-15min walk from the Checkpoint Charlie area, with the high-end stores and wonderful restaurants of Friedrichstrasse, and about a 30min walk from Museuminsel and the Alexanderplatz area. There are a number of transit spots within a 5-7 min walk of the hotel, making this an ideal spot for the traveler who appreciates being able to reach other parts of the city easily, but doesn't want to deal with the crowds in the more touristy areas.The staff (and Berliners in general, it seems) are wonderfully friendly, the rooms are contemporary and comfortable (the guests were suitably stylish too), and the hotel's small size and townhouse/courtyard setting give the place a nice, intimate feeling. There is free wireless access too, though it doesn't reach the higher floors very well - however, in the summer months it's much more pleasant to work outside in the courtyard. The breakfast at Johann was the nicest I've yet experienced in a European hotel. The variety of top-quality meats and cheeses was exceptional, there is every kind of bread/roll you could want, the fruit salad and yogurt are delicious, and they make a mean pot of coffee. Everything is served in a lovely breakfast room overlooking the courtyard with hours that suit both the earlybirds and the late risers.
