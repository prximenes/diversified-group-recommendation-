<Content>Faded Glory Faded grandeur, but we had a junior suite with two bathrooms that was very large and clean for a reasonable price, with a nice breakfast included. The hotel is very convenient for sight seeing.

<Content>Superb Hotel We had a Junior Suite at the Palace Hotel, which was very beautiful and spacious. The bathrooms were made of orange marble. The service was outstanding. Their brakfast buffet is unequaled in quality and variety, and the maitre d' is the best! Our entire family was very pleased with the stay. I should add that the location is also very convenient. Fully recommend this hotel.

<Content>A classic hotel Great location just blocks away from Las Ramblas on the Gran Via de les Corts - a quick and direct taxi ride from the airport.. Old world style and class at this hotel, including great beds and linens in spacious rooms furnished with antiques. Soon to undergo renovation; one hopes the changes will be minimal. A great place to stay in a lovely city.

<Content>DO NOT GO HERE...shutting down in 2 weeks for TWO YEARS! I just checked in today....and couldn't waste any time to post this review with the hope of saving someone else from a HUGE mistake in staying here!The staff is NOT professional, and are only trying to buy time for the next two weeks before they shut down for TWO YEARS! No one greeted us, no one had a smile. The carpet is totally all torn on the stairs...NO KIDDING...our room had pillows with blood stains...NO KIDDING...the seams in the carpet in the entry of the door to our room were all torn...NO KIDDING...there were dirty black finger prints all over the bathroom door handles form the inside...NO KIDDING...and the windows had face prints all over them from the previous guest...NO KIDDING...and no bars of soap in the bathroom at all...NO KIDDING. When I asked to talk to the manager...the response was there is no manager on weekends, only the housekeeping manager...and when I talked with him...he told me I am in THE best room...NO KIDDING!They tried to wash the wall, brought us two new pillows and some bars of soap...and not even a gentle apology or acknowledgement of the grosteque situation...NO KIDDING!Yes, we are talking about the same hotel...and I travel a lot...and am NOT a picky traveler. These are things you do not have to even think about for a 5+ hotel (and they are listed in the Luxury Hotels of the World as well). After a bit more discussion with the manager come to find out they are shutting down in 2 weeks...so the staff that is here is obviously the bare minimum. PLEASE...tell everyone you know so that they cancel their reservation!!!!!I even have photos I plan to post later...NO KIDDING!

<Content>Great service but very tired Stayed for 3 nights for my wife's birthday.Great Location for shopping, the port and sightseeing. All the staff were very helpful and polite and focused on making our stay enjoyable. Excellent breakfast buffet with lots of choice.Main disappointment is the decor of the rooms, which truly does need the refurbishment that is promised in November. Bathroom also needed work and the shower was not what I expect from a good quality hotel. If you are prepared to put up with those shortcomings its a fine example of a 'Grand European Hotel'.

<Content>Old fashioned grandeur We've just come back after a few days at the Palace and loved it. Is some of the grandeur faded? Probably. They are about to start a refurbishment programme and my wife and I both hope that this doesn't detract from the magic of the place.Old fashioned room - but huge. Everything worked perfectly for us. The staff were very friendly and everyone speaks English.The hotel is about 5 mins from Las Ramblas and 20 mins from the Port Area. We loved it and would stay again tomorrow.

<Content>Barcelona's grand old lady Coming back to our quiet room at the Palace after long days of sightseeing was a pleasure. The bed was very comfortable, and there were always plenty of big, thick towels in the bathroom, along with bathrobes.  The staff was very helpful in booking tours and anything else we needed. English speaking staff members were always on duty.I will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Totally overrated I definitely would not stay in this hotel again. I think it probably was fabulous in its day - the rooms are large (we had adjoining ones), the lobby is lovely, and when it was a Ritz maybe it was great. But it is way past it's prime. The toilets wobbled, the elevators are slow, the smell of smoking was unacceptable even in non-smoking rooms, and it was very dusty. What they need is a major remodel. Definitely not a five star hotel no matter what the Spanish goverment says.

<Content>overall dissapointing Elegant, spacious rooms, however the smell of tobacco was unbearable. It takes forever to get a shower (almost impossible) since the water temperature cannot be fixed; it is either scalding or icy. There is an adjacent Ritz hotel ( on the side street) which looks brand new and classy, but not advertised anywhere. Definitely not staying here again.

<Content>Very grand, impressive hotel We have just returned from a long weekend in Barcelona. We were booked into the Husa Oriente but less than 24 hours before were informed that our hotel had technical problems and we had to be relocated. They had moved us to the Palace Hotel, formerly the Ritz. There were eight in our party, including 4 teenage children, split into 4 rooms. Although the change was a little worrying we were pleasantly surprised. The Palace is a very grand hotel, the rooms are enormous, 2 spacious bathrooms with seperate w.c. per bathroom, good showers, very good maid service. The reception staff were very helpful, arranging taxis, recommending restaurants, giving directions etc. The hotel has a lot of history (read the book in the room), in the middle of a busy old city, it is not a modern Las Vegas hotel so don't go there if that is what you are looking for in a hotel.Use the metro, easy to get to, cheap to use, don't use the turistic bus on a Sunday - too many queues. Highly recommended for a city break.

<Content>Disappointing and Overpriced The public rooms of the hotel were superficially impressive, but the furniture was sad and in need of replacement. Likewise for our guest rooms, which were large and furnished with antiques, but were tired and in need of renovation in critical ways. The beds and pillows were second rate. The bathrooms were worse, including a plastic tub and smelly drains in the sinks. The concierges sent us to a tourist trap of a restaurant and were unhelpful in trying to arrange a tour of a site in the city.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel Palace Barcelona! I just returned as a solo traveler to Barcelona and stayed at the Hotel Palace in early April 2007. After much research, I was delighted with my choice and would stay at this property again. The service was amazing...all employees pleasant and eager to make your stay most comfortable. I decided on the breaksfast plan which was well worth the cost. A full and fresh breakfast offered in an elegant dining room. The room was beautiful! It was large and very comfortable. The maid service was excellent....very clean room and bathroom with service twice a day. After my arrival, a staff member arrived with a bottle of wine and chocolates. I felt very safe in this hotel. The lobby was wonderful and very inviting to sit and read and to enjoy social moments. It was centrally located to all the famous sights of Barcelona. I can honestly say, there was not one issue or slight complaint I had with this hotel. A perfect holiday in Barcelona at the Hotel Palace!!

<Content>Faded Beauty But I'd Still Recommend It We stayed at The Palace over Easter weekend 2007 and I would thorougly recommend it! The decor in the rooms is a bit beyond its best and shabby around the edges, but everything is provided and the rooms are enormous, with massive bathrooms. The reason I'd really recommend this hotel though is the service - the best I've ever had anywhere in the world. All the staff speak fluent English - even the chamber maids - and they were incredibly friendly, approachable and helpful. Our TV remote batteries died - there was someone at the door with fresh ones almost the second we'd hung up the phone to ask for them. My boyfriend wanted to know the score in a football game happening in England - the concierge checked on the internet for him right away. We wanted a restaurant recommendation - the concierge not only made several recommendations, but left a note in our pigeon-hole with their addresses and directions. In every situation, they did their absolute utmost to help us, and always graciously and with good humour. We would definitely stay again, so what if the carpets are a bit faded?

<Content>Time warp The former Ritz has a lot of potential but it is now essentially a poorly managed and dated grande dame.The building itself is beautiful and probably the most authentic in the city. The public areas but especially the hallways and rooms are very worn (except for the Roman-style bathroom if you can get one). Renovations will start soon.Service is generally poor, with uncaring staff who hardly speak English. The service at breakfast was terrible.How the Palace is still a member of the Leading Hotels is hard to understand.

<Content>Old school class I stayed in the Palace hotel for 4 days, as a birthday present for my brother. As we arrived, we took a very cheap bus that stopped very close to the hotel. As soon as we got out, a bell boy came to take our luggage and escorted us to the reception. We were upgraded from a regular room to a junior suite, without any extra costs or a reason at all. The breakfast buffet was amazing (we didn't eat at the hotel at any other time) with cava (spanish champagne) and strawberries! (and off course all kinds of pastry, bread, fruit, hot and cold foods) When my brother had an accident, we were brought to the hospital (he broke his hand) and the concierge provided the medicins etc. he had to use. They were very helpfull, and were fully at our service. Faboulous!

<Content>Great Location, Unfriendly, Inhospitable Front Desk My wife and I travelled to Barcelona to stay at the Ritz at the end of November. The good: It is a beautiful old hotel with an incredible location. The doorman and the bellhops were very helpful and friendly. The rooms have a lot of great character that one would expect from a grand old hotel.The bad: While the doorman and bellhops were friendly, the front desk was not as hospitable. They were unfriendly and rude during check in. And at check out, after having spend 5 nights, they insisted that someone made a call from our room and we would have to pay for it. We proved to the mean lady at the front that we were at the Palau Nacional (beautiful venue) at the time of the call and clearly one of the maids/hotel workers had made the call from our room during turn-down service. After having spend 5 nights, she was insistent on the 3 euro charge and was very rude.One experience like this can lend a bad taste to an entire vacation. With so many other great hotels in Barcelona, I will never stay at this hotel again nor recommend it to any of my friends. I hope the 3 euros was worth it to the hotel.

<Content>Excellent stay at the Palace Booked through special offer on Travelzoo. Went for a room rather than taking free upgrade to a suite as was told that these had no windows and we like a view.Fabulous frontage, reception, lounge etc with groovy chandeliers and all very nicely decorated for Christmas.Huge, high room, about the floor space of our entire downstairs, massive comfy bed and large bathroom with freebie toiletries, slippers  nice thick towelling robes.Staff and concierge all very helpful and friendly. Chose to have a lie-in rather than breakfast which was 拢15 pp, better to go a cafe locally if on a budget.Only tiny problems - had to remind about our welcome cava  chocs which then arrived promptly and a little noise from the road and Metro but we live in the country so prob most people wouldn't even notice. The flatscreen telly looked so incongruous in what was once the Ritz!Overall very pleasant and comfortable stay, excellent position for walking to Ramblas, old town in one direction or La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia etc in the other. Loads of bars  restaurants every where.

<Content>Worst shower ever Very nice old hotel. Beautiful lobby.But the shower was a disaster, if you can call it a shower. it was basically a showerhead with a drain to catch the water, no walls, so you freeze as you're taking a shower....until the water starts to flip out on you, first it scalds you, then it freezes you, then it goes back to giving you 3rd degree burns on 80% of your body.

<Content>Old World Elegance We just returned from a short stay at this elegant property. Everything that I've read here on Trip Advisor has been correct. The location of the hotel was great. It's only a few short blocks to the Las Ramblas and the tourist buses. The doorman, David was a wonderful help to us. He was able to recommend a great place to tapas, shopping and touring. He was a wealth of information and since he was from the US, he spoke fluent English!The hotel itself brought one back in time to the era in which it was built (1919). Yes, they needed an update on bedding and the windows were not exactly soundproof, but the benefits outweighed the detriments. All the staff were courteous and efficient. Once a few little updates are completed, it will be a wonderful place to stay!

<Content>nothing to complain stayed there in october. The location is good, because an underground-garage is near, you can reach it easily and it麓s only a ten minutes walk to the very heart of the town, and five minutes to the area where you find many nice shops and several buildings of gaudi.The building is a typical turn of the century hotel in a style you would await in a palace. the ground floor rooms are magnificent in a vaguely french style as in all ritz hotels and well maintained.Our room was although only an ordinary one big with a comfortable bed, the usual fittings including a marble mantlepiece. The bathroom was tiled with pink marble. i麓ve seen this before in josephine baker麓s house and that comes to me when i say ritzy. unfortunately a cheap restauration took place and parts of the former golden-coloured plumbing were replaced by chrome, but only parts. as i am no decorator, i could use it as well.room service was fast, efficient and friendly. isolation from the noise outside is very efficient.we would stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic hotel with great service I too was worried that I had made an incorrect choice after reading some of the reviews but after contacting the hotel beforehand they assured me that although the renovations would not start until 2007 we would be allocated a very nice room. The building itself is so impressive - in particular the Hall Bar/Lounge and the entrance. We had booked the standard deluxe room and it was spotlessly clean, full of antique furniture, a huge huge bed (very very comfortable), robes, slippers etc. The blackout linings at the window were excellent and we heard very little noise - it certainly did not disturb our sleep. Breakfast was excellent - every choice you could think of and omelettes and eggs made to order. The Hall Bar service was excellent. I would certainly return - because of the wonderfully central location and the facilities offered. The room service was the quickest room service I have experienced. Try Little Italy restaurant on the street opposite on the other side of the Gran Via (live jazz with excellent food). If you like traditional decor and furnishings you can't beat it - if you prefer modern 'cold' hotels don't stay here.

<Content>A wonderful experience! After reading several disappointing reviews, we were concerned about the reservation we had made for this property. We contacted the hotel directly and were informed that renovation would be starting the month after we would be here. I saw on Trip Advisor that some of the rooms had been renovated, but not all of them. We were assured that we would be well taken care of and decided to stick with our reservation. Upon our arrival at the hotel, we were informed that we had been upgraded to a mini suite and it was beautiful and spacious. The bed was larger than king size and was entered through double doors off the living room. There was a walk-in closet with separate hanging areas for my husband and myself - all paneled in a beautiful cognac colored wood stain. The bathroom was extremely large with double sinks - a separate glassed in area for the toilet and bidet, and then a large tub and separate shower at the end of the room. The shower had several different spray heads aimed at various areas of one's anatomy which was great. We thought the staff was cordial, courteous and personable. Our only regret was the fact that they were having a wedding reception the night of our arrival and so the main public room was closed off to the hotel guests - but was open the next morning. We believe it's always a good idea to communicate with your hotels before arrival and have had excellent service and attention when we have done this. We did hear from other guests that their rooms were not renovated yet, but were large and spacious. I would add that my husband and I both had massages while we were there and they were two of the best we've ever had! The breakfast buffet was included in our room rate and we were delighted with the choices as well as the service. The setting was elegant and beautiful. We will definitely return to this property for not only it's excellent location, but also for the attention and service we received as guests.

<Content>A Contradictory Review - Faultless Stay! I use tripadvisor prior to every trip and post reviews after every trip, so I was getting nervous prior to checking in (having read the previous reviews). However, our stay was extremely enjoyable. I had asked for a quiet room on an upper floor prior to our arrival and this was confirmed on checking in.Room 501 was on an upper floor with a view across Gran Via, it had recently been refurbished and had double-glazing (and an additional inner window, so triple-glazing if we're being pedantic). I am particular about noise and I can honestly say I slept so soundly I was worried about sleeping past breakfast.The room was nicely furnished with antiques and re-upholstered furniture - the bathroom in our room did not appear to have been refurbished, but was five star standard. The bed was spotless and turned-down each night. Concierge team were excellent, and breakfast was one of the best buffets we've had in a five star hotel. In light of previous reviews, and based on our experience, I would recommend communicating with the hotel in advance if you have any concerns.

<Content>Still a very good hotel We stayed here for a week in '04, and the reviews on TripAdvisor since then did give us pause for concern in booking again for Feb. '06. We visit Europe 4-5 times a year, and always stay in 4-or 5-star hotels, many of them also affiliated with LHW. I E-mailed them in November with my concerns about the renovation and the complaints registered here. I received a prompt E-Mail back, stating that the renovation would not start until later in '06 and we would be assured of a room in fine condition.We paid 190 Euros/nt for the identical room we had on the sixth floor two years ago. It was great; good bedding, high-quality linens, bathrobes and slippers, nice toiletries, a gift of chocolates and Spanish wine in the room. Everything was exceptionally clean. Yes, there were some dings on the chair by the desk, and a couple of very minor spots on the carpeting. Planning to write a review here upon our return, I specifically looked for the issues that were noted in previous reviews. But for the most part, there is very little to criticize.The service remains exemplary. The doorman, David (from Pennsylvania) is a gem... very helpful with directions, recommendations, and a taxi when we needed one. Both he and the concierege staff remembered us and gave us a warm welcome. The concierge staff are great... they provided wonderful restaurant recommendations. The location, for us, is ideal... several great tapas places within a few blocks, 4 blocks from Plaza Catalunya and the top of Las Ramblas. With the windows closed, no street noise to be heard at all.The only thing you have to be careful about is that the taxi drivers still know the hotel as the Ritz, not the Palace. There are several hotels in BCN with palace as part of the name, and we were taken to several of them by mistake. You have to give the driver the name AND street address.... get the hotel's card when you arrive, and provide it to any taxi driver you use. Is it the Four Seasons in Istanbul, the Grand Bretagne in Athens, or the Grand Hotel in Stockholm?No, it is showing a bit of wear. It needs some TLC to restore its former luster. But it is still a very well-managed, charming, old-world hotel in a great location in Barcelona.

<Content>A wonderful experience We stayed at the hotel in May pre-cruise, two rooms, one for my wife and son and I, one for my inlaws. My inlaws had a standard room, we had a junior suite. It was a wonderful experience. I will agree that there are some items that will benefit from the curent upgrading--such as the air conditioning system--but it is a beautiful and classic hotel. Our junior suite had two large and perfectly maintained bathrooms and curtains to separate the sleeping and sitting area. When I asked for sheets for the fold out sofa where our son was to sleep, a team from housekeeping arrived and brought a complete mattress to put on top of the pull out mattress so our son would be more comfortable--amazing service. My inlaws were delighted with their room as well.The public areas are spectacular, and the breakfast room is one of the best I have ever seen. This hotel is a jewel, and it just needs a litte shine to return to former glory

<Content>Misses the mark for "5 star GL" You can see how this was once the hotel in Barcelona (when it was The Ritz), and there is still a lot to love here, but it's not all it could be, anymore. The public spaces are grand, and a lot of the furnishings and fixtures were beautiful antiques, incl. in the room. Some, however, were too well worn, others not so clean looking (too many fingerprints on elevator doors, windows and headboards) - although the most important items like linens and baths were pristine. Some updating and attention to details (install modern locks and safes, brighten the room decor, bring back the robes, etc.)would go a long way.Since we spent 5 days here, we appreciatated the spaciousness of the rooms, the high ceilings, large double vanities,twin closets and comfy king bed. We had a great view over Barcelona to Mt Tibidabo and La Sagrada Familia from our small terrace on the top floor, and service was efficient and unobtrusive. We actually chose this hotel for its compromise location, on the lower edge of the upscale Eixample area, and while only a few blocks from the center of it all, Plaza de Catalunya, it was far enough from La Rambla's crowds to be quiet and relaxing. However, we found that the Barri Gotic/Born/Old City areas (away from touristy La Rambla)were more enjoyable and unique to Barcelona - and wished we had chosen to stay somewhere there, instead.

<Content>Not worth the money For the price, it was not worth the money. The location is reasonable, but I could not get a good night sleep because the mattress was old and soft. My husband and I would end up sinking towards the middle of the bed while we slept. When I complained to the hotel they simply shrugged their shoulders and didn't do anything about it.

<Content>Stay here after renovations are complete This review is coming from a very fussy, self-proclaimed hotel critic.Well, I don't want to be as harsh as the others but they are mostly right. While the lobby and tea room are quite lovely, the rooms are not. And that's what you pay for, right? The rooms need an entire overhaul. We stayed in a suite which was a fair size but the furniture was beat-up, the bathrooms needed updating (the porcelain in the tub in one of the bathrooms was coming off). The good news is that the manager said renovations start in January 2006. The michelin 1-star rated restaurant, Caelis, was a nice dining experience but the food (nouvelle Catelan fushion?) was a taste which left something to be desired. Very pricey for what we got. Breakfast buffet in the garden room was in a lovely setting with a large selection of basic food offerings. It's a great location, walking distance to the Pl. Gracia shopping area and Guadi architectural attractions. Concierge staff was very nice and helpful--not all of our luggage made it and they called the airlines for us a few times daily. I highly would recommend staying here AFTER the room renovations have been completed.

<Content>Was the Ritz now expensive and terrible. We went a while ago but it was the same then as it is now by recent reviews. Its sad that a once great hotel has become so derided and fallen. Its a peice of history that when we visited overcharged and under delivered on quality and features. Main one no air con and no room fans and in summer that counts in Barcelona. A real shame but not to be recomended at all. I would imagine its up for redevelopment or closure!

<Content>Stay elsewhere for the price Stayed here pre-cruise for 1 night. Found hotel on Leading Hotels of the World and surprised it was part of that group. We had a king bed, 2 baths and living room. The room seemed kinda old and musty. Sheets and bed about as comfortable as a LaQuinta. The hotel location is good and buffet breakfast was great. But I'd rather stay elsewhere for the price.

<Content>Does not deserve to be called Ritz We stayed there with my wife for 3 nights. Location is good, building is average, service leaves a lot to be desired. The restaurant staff definitely need training to learn what 5 star service should be. After receiving rude service in the restaurant, the hotel manager was very apologetic and arranged for our transfer to the airport for free, which was a nice gesture. However, I would not stay there again. This hotel does not deserve to be called Ritz.

<Content>Horrible ... The Ritz is certainly not a 5-star hotel nor is it a Leading Hotel of the World! The hotel is run down and dirty. The rooms have air-conditioning that can only be switched on (which makes the room far too cold) or off (unbearabky hot in summer), no adjustment is possible. The so-called gym consists of one machine that is out of order. The service is equally bad. We were planning to stay there for 6 nights but moved out after two nights. Me moved to the Hotel Arts which costs about the same but is much better than the Ritz.

<Content>5 star hotel? I don't think so My wife and I stayed at Barcelona Ritz for 4 nights during May of 2005. The hotel is worthy of neither the 5 star rating nor The Leading Hotels of The World membership. The property itself is magnificent, with 12 foot ceilings, great lobby and rooms are quite large (about 500-600 sq. feet). However, the hotel has not been renovated for quite some time, and especially the bathrooms are in bad shape. The first room we got was a Jr. Suite. It had two small square rooms and felt very compartmentalized. We asked for a single large room and got a decent one. Its carpet was very old and with stains, but otherwise OK. The surprise came when my wife almost got burned in the shower, because the faucet was circa 1950 and there was no way to estbalish consistent flow of hot and cold water.I asked for a different room. Was shown two, with only one actually having a better bathroom situation. The rest of stay was OK, but it was clear that neither hotel nor its staff know what 5 star service is all about.

<Content>Disliked the Ritz I stayed at the Ritz in a Jr. Suite on May 20th and 21st. It was the worst room I have ever had. I asked to be moved and was told they would move me in the morning but they never got around to it. I called both the reception and the concierge and got no answer at either. The service was bad and reception seemed to not care. It was just not me that was dissapointed. There were several post cruise people staying at the Hotel and everyone except one did not like their room. This is not a 5 star hotel as stated. It is a two star at best. The location was good, but I will never stay there again.

<Content>Very disappointing We spent a weekend at the Ritz and we're still trying to figure out how it is rated as a five star hotel.On arrival we were informed that our room would not be ready until 4.00pm;a very late check-in time for a luxury hotel.We went to see some of the sights and when we were finally allowed into our room they forgot to bring us our luggage.After waiting forty five minutes I telephoned reception and it was brought to us.Two days later my wife attempted to book a restaurant through the concierge.She telephoned the concierge desk for fifteen minutes without reply.She then telephoned reception,informed them of the problem and asked them to contact the concierge.The receptionist hung up the telephone while she was explaining the problem.She then telephoned the manager who was apologetic and sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne.It was a nice gesture but we'd prefer good service than good champagne.Barcelona is a lovely city and we enjoyed ourselves outside the environs of the hotel.We'll visit Barcelona again but we'll avoid the Ritz.

<Content>Loved the Ritz A couple of friends and I stayed at the RITZ in Barcelona April 7-12.We loved every moment of our stay. Before going there I was afraid the hotel would be run down, since it hasn't been renovated for the past years, but it is a lovely hotel, the rooms we were given (which were a couple of their regular rooms) were very BIG, on the sixth floor with a lovely view, with all the aminities of a Grand Hotel, like exquisite bathroom toiletries, lots of crisp linen towels etc., the hotel's buffet breakfast was wonderful and all the people in the hotel were extremely friendly and went out of their way to serve us and please us. I would also like to mention the helpfulness and efficiency of their reservation department. The location of the hotel is ideal and, if you are looking for a good hotel with personal service, I would recommend the RITZ highly!

<Content>This is not a Leading Hotel of the World My boyfriend and I stayed at the Ritz recently (March 05) and were very disappointed with the service, staff and upkeep of the hotel and rooms. Claiming to be one of the Leading Hotels of the World, the Ritz has to do a lot more to live up to the name it has bought itself. Breakfast was served in a very cold environment. The staff at the hotel did nothing that was extra special. And to top it off, one of our bags was thrown in the garbage by accident and the hotel public relations manager offered nothing when we said this was unacceptable behavior. I would highly recommend spending your money elsewhere.

<Content>The Pitz ! Very shabby bedrooms. General furnishings need restored (or even just cleaned would be good). Don't let the name / the chain deceive you - certainly not like the Ritz Paris.3* at best (Go to the Hotel Arts, please)
