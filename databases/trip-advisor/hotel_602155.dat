<Content>Lovely apartments, friendly staff! I booked the Schoenhouse Apartments after reading good reviews and they didn't disappoint. The staff were friendly and spoke good English. The apartments were clean, spacious and modern. Situated round a courtyard so a quiet location but only a short walk from the main attractions and the U bahn station. The Shoenhaus deli is good for breakfast and White Trash bar opposite is a quirky, atmospheric bar that serves great food. The apartments have cooking facilities so would be excellent for a longer stay... no complementary tea/coffee is provided so if you're going on a short break remember to pack your own! Overall, really nice apartments.

<Content>just fab Chose the Schoenhaus after a lot of deliberation, between this and the Ackselhaus and Adina apartments (have stayed in the Adina in Copenhagen which we loved). I am sure we made the right choice. This is a really workable and cosy place. We had a one bed apartment in the new building - on the top floor. The bedroom was huge, the living room/kitchen fine size (though a bit smaller than the lower floors as the balcony cut into the room space not added on). Bathroom small and not luxy (no bath but it seems its hard to find a bath in aparthotels in Berlin) but perfectly ok. Lots of hall space for buggy, good TV and DVD set up before we arrived (just ask when you book). In all it felt like home from home quickly. The location is great if you have kids - Kollwitzplatz is only 5/10 mins walk away and has a playground (more English speaking kids than Germans it seemed!) and many child friendly pavement cafes around the square. The main sites of the Eastern side of town (the museums) are walkable in less than half an hour - longer to the Brandenburg Gate and Tiergarten.What was perhaps most useful for a family stay was the deli/cafe. You can pop down in the morning and get a breakfast to take up, and they do very nice pasta until 8pm or so, again you can take it to your flat to eat in. Made it really easy not to have to plan every meal and know that there was always a last minute option. supermarkets are v close.would reccomend daytrips to potsdam and wansee via train. and dont miss the interlocking courtyards

<Content>Spacious and quiet in a great location The three of us stayed in the deluxe room for three nights. Perfect location for art galleries and nice bars nearby (Erdbeer for the win). White Trash Fast Food is so near that you will manage to find your hotel room no matter how smashed you are.Large, high-ceilinged rooms, nice interior except too few chairs, and the kitchen was a little too small for the furniture. Well-equipped kitchen and washing machine for clothes that we didn't really have the chance to use because of our short stay and preference to dine out ... I would imagine that these things would be very useful for people staying longer.WLAN in our room was having a pretty weak signal. Also some kind of safe would have been nice. The reception was friendly and relaxed. The room was in the inner yard which was very quiet.

<Content>OK My family and I stayed at the Schoenhouse Apartments in October 2008. We stayed in room 209. The reception was friendly, but just pointed the way to our room. If you plan on arriving late, reception closes at 20.00hrs, so you might have to make arrangements. The hotel is located in the old East Berlin area, so the surrounds are a little bland. It is located between two U Bahn stations, only minutes to the Rosa Luxemburg station. There are two supermarkets just down the road. The hotel can do your laundry for you, but can be a little expensive. For a small load 4.50 Euros to wash and 4.50 Euros to dry. The rooms are a good size with a large bathroom and a reasonably equipped kitchen. The room was clean, but the 4 days we were there not once was our room cleaned. We were only given one small bar of soap between three of us for 4 days. It would have been good if they supplied a small amount of coffee, tea, sugar and milk for the first day. There was fast wifi available in the room. I think I would try somewhere a little more central next time.

<Content>Fantastic apartment We had spent nearly two weeks travelling around Germany and were so lucky to find these apartments, a perfect end to our holiday. Spotlessly clean and well equipped with two TV's and decor that just makes you wish you could live there. The staff were all friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

<Content>To be back We were lucky to stay there for the first time in Berlin and we loved this place at once. Excellent location (2 minutes from Rosa Luxemburg metro station), where you can feel a real, true Berlin, very friendly Schoenhouse people (can't name it just staff), which helped us a lot with all needed documents for our trip (thanks all!), beautiful rooms where you can find everything for living months and a nice old house where ghosts seem to appear from time to time. We are sure to stay at Schoenhouse next time.

<Content>Fantastic Place to Stay! We arrived only to be upgraded from the most basic 'Junior' apartment to the deluxe apartment. Absolutely gorgeous apartment under the eaves of a wonderful old building. We had two huge double bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen/living/dining room, as well as a juliette balcony and a sit-out balcony! It was located at the very top of the building (balconies opened onto a charming inner courtyard, bedrooms had windows/velux windows which overlooked the street) and was reached via a glass elevator!All this for 鈧?5!The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. You can eat in their little deli or hire a bike. Downside - but only small things:- Reception shuts at around 8pm, so you have to gain access from side-street, which was fine.- We opened the velux windows only to be showered in thick dust! The wind blew it off the huge beams above the bed so we had to sleep in the other room.- Only one bathroom to be shared by all - this was fine for us as there were only two of us.Located just 50m from subway (rosen somehing platz!)I would definitely recommend the Shoenhouse Apartments.

<Content>Schoenhouse like home Recently stayed at Schoenhouse Apartments and it was truly special. The apts are huge (we had a Deluxe in the newer, elevator building), super clean, incredibly modern in furnishings, and amenities (free wifi, flat screens) and so on. Best tho was the staff. Had the privilege of meeting Immanuel, one of the owners, who was gracious, friendly, and very interested in our opinion of his property. After meeting him, it's understandable that all staff, from the front desk to the morning cook in the deli to housekeeping etc, everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome. I think it is an incredible value and should we ever return to Berlin, we'd only stay there. The neighborhood is great, always felt safe, the Ubahn is a 2 min walk, a grocery store and organic grocery are across the street, as is a pharmacy and nightclub too. 5 min walk to Alexanderplatz, wonderful shopping, open air markets and killer restaurants abound. Schoenhouse Apartments are really a hidden gem.

<Content>Great place to stay The Schoenhouse Apartments were perfect for us. The location is in a great neighborhood and convenient -- you can see a U-Bahn station and grocery store from the front door of reception. Our unit was large, even as a junior apartment, with enough room to unpack, spread out, and be in separate rooms when necessary. Wifi is free. There were kitchen facilities that included a frig, microwave, toaster, kettle, coffee maker, and hot plate units. There is a small Italian restaurant in the lobby area, but we never got around to trying it out (smelled good, though). While the apartments are part of converted older buildings, they are quite quiet. Our unit looked out on an interior courtyard. No elevator, though, so practice your stair stepping with luggage! Dishwashing liquid is supplied and liquid hand soap is in the bathroom, but there are no other toiletries. There was not daily maid service or room service, but we don't need that.

<Content>Loved it! Amazing hideaway, very close to the lively area of Berlin (Hackeschermarkt). Amazing rooms, very big and equipped with everything you need.Wifi was free, which is a big plus for me.Kind reception, and next to the reception is a deli, where you can pick up drinks and nice sandwiches.I recommend this experience to anyone who is sick of these standard monster hotels you see in every city in the world.

<Content>Brilliant apartments Stayed in the apartment for 4 days. Brilliant location, very close to the centre of Berlin. Tucked behind a main road, it was very quiet and peaceful in the apartment. The place was absolutely spotlessly clean, very comfortable bed and well equipped.The staff spoke excellent english and were very helpful and friendly. Myself and my husband loved Berlin and the Schoenhouse apartment. We intend going back this December.

<Content>Great apts, great location, great price I was more than impressed with our stay at Sch apts. The location is fantastic, on the border between Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg. For those who only know Mitte, I would whole heartedly recommend heading into prenz-berg. Kastinallee, Kollowitzplatz etc.The apartments themselves are clean, very spacious, have every ameniety. The staff are very helpful, speak perfect english, and the cafe downstairs has great food.There is a great choice of bars/restaurants/nightlife close by. Unfortunately Im not a huge fan of german food, so our choices were more international.Some of what we liked: Scotch  sofa is a great local chilled bar, a little up into prenz-berg. We made this our local. A short cab ride into prenz-berg, 'The bird' is a U.S style steak restaurant, with some of the best we've tasted. White trash fast food, directly across the road. This has decent westernised food, with live music every night. Staff are a little unfriendly, but we found it worth the perserverenceFor a bit of Berlin glamour and a fancy meal 'Spindler  Klatz' is deffo worth a look. Good morning Vietnam, is just down the road and is tasty, very cheap vietnamese food. The list goes on....Apartments were great all round, and I would definately return.

<Content>Liked it! Nice location, very friendly and helpful staff, plus the price wasn't bad either... :)We travelled with a few months old daughter of ours, so we appreciated the fact that the staff lended us a travel crib for the baby free of charge.Otherwise the equipment was OK too - nothing too fancy but everything we needed was there.All in all, we were really happy with Schoenhouse.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised! I only booked this break with my friend because there were cheap flights, i had no idea how much Berlin could offer. I was only there for 2 nights but i had a fantastic time, loads to see and do! As for the apartments, they were clean, well equiped and the staff were the most helpful i have ever come across. The man who greeted us when we came in to reception spent about 20mins going through which places were the best to go and see in Berlin and told us the places to avoid as well. We thought he was just one of a kind but the next day there was another genteman on reception who was just as helpful. Everyone we came across in Berlin spoke at least a little English so we got on fine and the whole holiday ran smoothly!Great location, just one stop from main station and if you are brave enough, the main part is close enough to walk to.

<Content>Fantastic We stayed here when we went to Berlin to run the marathon. There were 9 of us staying in 3 apartments. Each one was better than the next. The staff were very friendly and helpful, even carrying our very heavy bags up 5 flights of stairs for us! No lift.We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment on the 5th floor. The apartment was large, bright and clean. It had most facilities you require for a short stay in this great city.The deli below was really nice and good prices too. Loads of great bars and restaurants nearby and the station is a stone throw away.Only downside was climbing 80 steps after running 26 mile. It took a while!I plan on going back to this great city and will definately stay here again

<Content>Great accommodation We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment with terrace on the top floor - would definitely recommend this accommodation. The apartment was very modern and hip, bathroom was huge (there were 4 of us), and the terrace is a bonus. The apartment has a fully equipped kitchen which we made good use of (cooked dinner and ate at the table on the terrace) and importantly a washing machine for those on a long trip. The location is excellent on the edge of the city, the surrounding neighbourhood of Prenzlauer Berg is very pretty with lots of dining and shopping options, and the train station is close by for the 5 minute trip into the city centre. If you are staying a few days and want to experience how the locals live, then this is the place. A nice home away from home to return to at the end of long site seeing days. The reception area with deli/cafe is very elegant and of the moment. The staff were fantastic. Two things to consider: We were there in spring bit i think the apartment would be very hot in summer. The other downer - no lift!

<Content>gem眉tlich Berlin. Great city if you love culture and arts. The city has a welcoming and inviting atmosphere. Schoenhouse is located in de centre of the city and is a few steps away from de subway. You can easly travel from the west (shoppers heaven) to east (more bohemian, artsy, very cheap and fantastic food). The apatment is nicely layed out, good beds and has a friendly staff. We had a great time! Tough be careful if you have bad health or if you have poor stamina because the building has no elavator and has steep stairways. So don't hire an apartment on the fourth floor if you don't like/want to walk the stairs!

<Content>Great Location My boyfriend and I stayed here a few weekends ago and loved it! The location was excellent, near loads of cool speciality shops, restaurants, bars and cafes. The apartments are a couple of minutes from the U-bahn (though seems like everywhere in Berlin is only a couple of minutes from the U-bahn!). We were really happy with the price and got a free upgrade to a bigger apartment when we arrived. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the apartment was great - quite minimalist/ikea-like with good shower and kitchen-dining area, TV and DVD player etc. No restaurant facilities ,which suited us to chill out and make our own breakfast but perhaps not ideal for those who want pampering! We loved Berlin and plan to go back in the summer - will definitely stay in Schoenhouse again.

<Content>Great place, great location Stayed here for the wknd last week and had a fantastic time. Best part of town we could have chosen in the former East near great restaurants, bars and cool shops. Quite hippyish area which I loved. The apartments are immaculate and extremely clean. The staff were really great and we hired bikes from them for the day which is a fantastic way to see the city.A great tip we got is to book a table at the Reichstag rooftop restaurant which is reasonable value, great food and the most amazing views over the city.

<Content>Great location, good value My boyfriend and i stayed here for 3 nights. We were happy with the price -195 euros. The apartment is a short walk from the subway at rosa-luxembourg, in the former east berlin. It is on a main road but situated in a courtyard behind another building so is very quiet. Our bed was very comfortable, our shower room modern and clean and the cooking/dining facilities were very acceptable. Nearby there is a cracking supermarket to stock up on goodies and booze. Compared to the uk, the prices were super-cheap. There is a nice italian restuarant a couple of doors down and a couple more doors down is a fantastic thai place. We would definately go back to berlin and definately try and book these apartments.
