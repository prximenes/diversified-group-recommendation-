<Content>Better than other reviews Booked on Last Minute at the last minute and took pot luck on allocated hotel. 30 walk from Central Station via christmas light lit streets. Could of jumped on a tram or a cabbut chose to walk. 15 minute train ride from airport at 3.5 euros each.Hotel located right on floating flower market canal. We upgraded to a superior room for another 50 euros per night and stayed in room 726. Was on 7th floor, right on corner with 2 balcony's and views across the city. The beautiful clock tower was right outside which chimed throughout the night. A bit irritating if you want a lie in. Room spacious and well laid out, large marble bathroom with twin sinks and a bidet. Bed really comfortable but we needed an extra blanket as it was cold whilst we were there. Asked for extra pillows also. Dont have brekkie at the hotel (20 euros) walkdown by the flower market and eat in one of the little cafe's. Food good and reasonable.

<Content>A good time was had by all... I stayed at the Jolly Carlton christmas/new years 2007 and thought it was great. Everyone was very helpful and polite, the room was a little small, but served the purpose. I had a beautiful view of the street and nicolas church, and eventhough the hotel is right in the party/clubbing district i had no problems with noise or disturbance. great location within easy walking distance of the flower market, shopping area, restaurants, rembrandtsplein and much more. the breakfast is a bit expensive (costing 20 Euro) but a great big delicious buffet with everything imaginable. I am going back there this year for my christmas holiday and I am really looking forward to it.

<Content>MASSIVE reconstructive surgery needed. Neither cheap nor cheerfull. We stayed here on the nights of November 9th and 10th 2008.We were VERY sad to have left the excellent 5 star we had just stayed in (reveiew here) yet as this hotel had been pre-payed we were obliged. We upgraded to a very large delux room out of necessity as soon as we saw how tired, small and pokey the standard room was. Time travel in the worst sence not only in decor but in that it reminded me of ropey hotels i had stayed in when travelling as a student. Nostalgia of the unwelcome kind.This former Jolly hotel (an italian chain) was purchaced by the spanish group NH two years ago but it seems that not a euro has been speant to give it a very needed facelift - this place is way past botox helping. It is classed as a fourstar but in this day and age it is rather a poor big akward 3 star. Class it as a budget travelling experience that is neither cheap nor cheerfull.One member of the mainly Italian staff was very helpful and friendly whilst the others were much less charming or efficient than they could have been. Desipte our informing them of our arrival at 15hrs on the sunday afternoon the day before our room was not ready before 17h30 !! A complimentary drink to apologise went someway to reducing our dissappointment. The corridors are dusty, old and depressing as was our room despite its spaciousness. The bathroom was small by modern standards and the shower curtain too short which soaked the floor after two showers. We were informed that housekeeping was off duty after 17hrs so the floor would remain like that till the next morning. Fresh towels were provided however. The complimentary toileteries, though seeming modern with their vivid colours, stank. The bed was uncomfortable which rendered the modern 'lifestyle' approach of a pillow menu totally futile and incongruous. The room was realy cold at night. There is no roomservice after 22h.Beware, incidentals were really expensive, Internet accces was 22 euros aday. Parking 80 Euros for two days and the minibar, badly appointed and a rip off.Over all this hotel needs to decide whether it become a cheaper budget hotel or a more luxurious destination .. in either case it needs a LOT OF MONEY SPENT TO MAKE IT A PLEASANT PLACE TO STAY. The location is good however and we had a good view over the bustling flower market. Ill be giving the NH Carlton a miss .... until at least i have heard of its having undergone massive reconstructive surgery.

<Content>Good Choice We were very happy with this hotel. I was perfect location, short walk to a lot of the popular areas. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed in one of the Standard rooms and it was a good size and very comfortable. The only problem we had was the first night our room was very very hot (turns out the hotel had the central heating on). We tried to open the window but it was only the 2nd floor and right on the street so we couldnt sleep. When we told the front desk the next morning they were very apologetic and offered to swap rooms for us. The new one was much better, on the 6th floor and a lot cooler.I would definetly stay here again and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Safe choice, good location Spent few nights there in September 2008 together with my wife. Nothing spectacular; basic hotel, clean but not very spacious standard rooms, standard amenities: minibar, nice bed (with a neat bonus: they had few pillow types to choose from with tiny samples in the room). Breakfast was pricey (20e) but comprehensive and it was set in a nice restaurant hall, with natural morning sunlight flooding in. Location of the hotel is great: Rembrantplein just 150metres away and 10 minutes walk to the Dam, 20 to central station. Trams and taxies were quick to catch directly in front of the hotel.Basicly hassle free, safe choice. There are a lot more dodgier hotels in Amsterdam...

<Content>Capitalism at its Best In September 2008 I was in Amsterdam on business. I had not been in Amsterdam for 30 years and so I elected to stay over the weekend to explore the city. The City was inundated with a very large conference and obtaining a hotel room was next to impossible. As a result, I was required to change hotels from the NH Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky to the NH Carlton Amsterdam. Basically I went from a 5 star hotel and paid and incremental 130 Euros/night to stay in a three star hotel. The Carlton leaves much to be desired and this does not just address it's location. Upon arriving at the check-in office there was a large group on conference delegates in front of me. They had booked 4 rooms, they had the confirmation verified prior to arrival but at the front desk they were told that there were only two rooms available. So sorry there is nothing we can do! the front desk stated. I checked in next and was told that I had a superior deluxe room. Which made sense since I was paying 400 Euro's for the night. However when I got to my room, it definitely wasn't a superior deluxe room. The worst part was the air conditioning didn't work. I called to the front desk and they politely told me it would be fixed upon my checking out of the hotel. I indicated since my room faced the street and the noise was intolerable what would they do to make up for the inconvenience. I was told nothing. It was a conference and I would have to live with the consequences.The next day I spoke with the Front Desk Manager, she indicated that they had upgraded me and I should have been happy with the room. I suggested that the upgrade was not as important as sleep especially since I was required to have the window open onto the street the entire night. The hotel said that was too bad, many hotels in Amsterdam do not have air conditioning and they asked how I was going to settle my account. No appologies were given and I was told that I should be happy to have had a room at all. My inclination in the future would be to direct my business to a hotel chain that is more interested in the satisfaction of the consumer and not how they are going to exploit the situation.

<Content>finally, a good hotel in Amsterdam We go to Amsterdam every year, and it's been difficult to find a good hotel at a reasonable price. Even so-called luxury hotels don't measure up to first class hotels in other cities. The Jolly Carlton was a very pleasant surprise. Check in and overall service was great. We were even offered a free room upgrade. The room was spacious, and the bathroom was clean and modern with nice amenities.. The hotel is steps from the Rembrandtplein, around the corner from the flower market and a short walk to the Leisdeplein. Considering the location, it was fairly quiet as well..We'd definitely return.

<Content>Good Quality Hotel Stayed here for 3 nights at the end of May and couln't fault hotel.25th wedding anniversaryso booked a deluxe room which had fantastic view over Muntplein.Did not eat at the hotel but there are plenty of cafes within 5 minutes walk for breakfast etc.Previous reviewers have mentioned the noise but despite overnight work on the road outside were not kept awake and indeed if you closed the windows you could not hear a sound.Short walk from the hotel to everything Amsterdam has to offer.Ate out most nights on Utrechsestraat which has bars and restaurants frequented by local amsterdammers unlike the tourist traps nearer the centre.

<Content>Excellent location I stayed here at the beginning of May with 9 friends. I thought the location of this hotel was excellent - close to all the main attractions and easy to walk everywhere from. It is situated right next to the flower market. My room was average sized, clean and did the job well, it had a small balcony with a nice view. I found the staff friendly and helpful and all in all had no complaints. Was quite good value for the money. My friends and I had a fabulous weekend in Amsterdam and the Jolly Carlton served us well.

<Content>A Jolly good time at the Jolly! The location of this hotel is excellent, we were able to walk everywhere. The rooms are indeed a little on the warm side, there is air con but it's not all that effective. These rooms could perhaps get way too warm heading further into Summer. If the black out curtains are kept shut during the day it helps keep the room cool though. The service from the reception staff was very slow on check out but I did not find them to be rude at all. The waiters in the bar were very cheery and insisted in bringing us crudites every time we drank in there! I would def stay here the next time I go to Amsterdam. Special mention goes to the very cheery doorman - nice to see someone happy at work for a change!

<Content>Awful! Terrible stay at this hotel. We were put in a converted meeting / conference room. Not a very good conversion either. We were sleeping on a camper bed which was practically on the floor. It wasn't made for the room as there were no bedside tables either. Really uncomfortable and hard to get on and off the floor, as it was so close to the ground. When we asked if it could be made higher, the answer was if you can't do it yourself, neither can we....There was even the little kitchenette off the room, as it was a meeting room. But not useful for us, as completely empty, not for the guests to use. Check in and out experience was just as bad. Rude front office staff. Will not stay here again. Were still charged full room rates.

<Content>Great location/rooms too hot I was late booking this hotel - needing to attend a conference at the Amsterdam Rai. Hotel is part of an Italian chain - Jolly, which is now part of a bigger Spanish chain -NH Hotels. Jolly Carlton is very centrally located for all sites, cafes and bars etc, but ask for room at the back of hotel - much quieter. I had a room on 7th (top) floor - good views and bonus of a balcony to sit on - room faced west so beautiful afternoon sun. Rooms are small but well equipped. Internet is based on a 24hr charge - so you pay during the night when asleep. I found the rooms very warm - no air con as advertised - this is purely a heating system - I slept with windows wide open - hence need for rear room. Bed firm but pillows lumpy - no pillow menu as is the case now in many quality chain hotels. I used the room service for 2 meals - excellent value and excellent quality of food and service. All staff top notch. Hotel clean and tidy. I would use again for location, price was reasonable, but I would want same room again for extra space outside to watch Amsterdam at night. Recommended.Steve

<Content>Not so Jolly Hotel was very centrally located in a nice area.Lobby and public areas were very attractive. Breakfasts were excellent. Staff helpful. Sadly our room was small, dark and smelt of cigarette smoke, there was dust under the furniture. The bathroom, however was very good. The room overlooked a back street with a local disco which was very noisy at night, with passers by at all hours.I think we were unlucky as we apparently got one of the last rooms unbooked, so this was not a good room, although not cheap.I would advise checking the size and location of the rooms before booking and if there are any non-smoking.The hotel was acceptable, but next time I'll find somewhere else!

<Content>Great trip, great hotel This is a great hotel - it was superbly located by the flower market and the staff were all extremely friendly. The room was clean and the shower was the best I've ever found in a hotel. Because it was so centrally located it was little noisy at night but it wasn't a real problem. Overall, I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>A very average hotel to be avoided if looking for a good nights sleep It's 6:30 am and I'm writing this review to vent a bit of my fustration of having been woken up now 5 times. I've called reception already 3 times and they are quick on getting the other guest to quiet down but there are really just too many party goers in this hotel.If you are coming to Amsterdam for a quiet relaxing weekend this is not the hotel for you.

<Content>well positioned in relation to attractions Stayed for four days in this hotel. Its well positioned in relation to attractions etc. However it is so overpriced. 鈧?.50 for a small vodka from th mini bar, the hoel bar was only a euro less ans charged 鈧?.00 for a beer. the hotel bar is soulless as is the rest of the hotel. It lacks all atmosphere and while staff are polite, friendly is not a description I would use. When we arrived we were shown to room 536. It was a nightmare even for a standard room. It was tiny and the view was a blank wall. We had to ask for upgrade asap couldnt spend the night in it. 鈧?5 per night to up to a superior room (533) three doors down but it was worth it. It was in no way luxurious, the carpet was even faded and patched. But at least we could walk about and had a view.Breakfast not great either you could have your eggs boiled or scrambled! So so! Poor choices.And another thing for a 4star hotel what are they doing using such cheap toilet tissue! It was dreadfull had to go and buy some! Have stayed in cheaper hotels in amsterdam and have received far better service.

<Content>Great Hotel in Central Location If you want an upper mid-range Hotel in Amsterdam, look no further. Excellent location within easy walking distance of city sights.Red Light district after dark is something that has to be experienced.Huge number of great places to eat at reasonable prices and why does Heineken taste so much better in Amsterdam?Highly recommended.

<Content>Great location and great service The location cannot be beat. Its just across the canal and up the street from the Grand Amsterdam but a fraction of the price. Right next to the flower market and a few minutes walk from almost everywhere. The front desk staff were great and we really enjoyed our stay. Second time staying with the Jolly chain and were very pleased with both this hotel and their property in London. thanks Jolly!!!

<Content>Jolly Good Stayed in the Jolly Carlton late November 07. Loved the location, being central to all major attractions. The flower market is right beside the hotel with the main museums, Ann Frank house etc all within easy walking distance. Great resteraunts and nite life exist right beside the hotel. Our favourite was the Argentinian Steak house around the corner in Reguliersdwarstratt. The steak was top notch. Service so friendly. The size of the standard rooms in the Hotel were a little small considering the price we paid, - 鈧?50 for 3 nights. They were clean and well kept and so this was a small gripe as the location and the friendliness of the staff were the main reason we liked this hotel. The only issue I have with this hotel is that they promote the Airport Shuttle bus as advertised on reception. We thought this would be a convenient and cost effective way to get us to the airport for our return home. Boy was I wrong, we arranged at reception to be picked up at 11am, but by 11.45am there was still no sign of the bus. The porters on duty were extremely apologetic and were concerned for us. They did admit that we were not the first people to be let down by this service. We were panicing at this stage, fearful that we would miss our flight. One of the porters hailed us a taxi on the street and we made a mad dash to the airport and made it on time. So moral of the story is, if you want a hassle free return journey home, avoid at all costs the airport shuttle bus that is advertised at this hotel and I imagine at other hotels in Amsterdam.

<Content>Old facilities and Staff Not helpful Although the hotel has no bad conditions, it is not worthwile the price.The problem is that in Amsterdam hotels are too expensive and it is difficult to find a better deal.Anyway, my experience is that:*Staff is not helpfull:-I asked twice to know about check-in of some friends and they didnot tell me.-I had to ask twice for another boiler because mine does not work.-I asked twice for extra-hagers (we was 3 people) and I couldn't get it them four days.-Bath ammenities were for two people and ours was a triple.*Old facilities:-dirty carpet-broken sheets.-Out of fashion facilities.-Don't disturb sign was electronic but doesn't work.*Others:-Not safebox in the room.-Expensive wireless not included-They charged our credit card for the whole stay the first day.-Luggage deposit not careful. They leaved a door to street open for a while!On the other hand, it has an excellent location.

<Content>Very central and comfortable hotel Main advantage is unbeatable location, minutes walk from all the Amsterdam sights. 鈧?5-45 taxi journey to airport. Rooms adequate. Staff courteous and very helpful.Would stay here again if on a weekend break. If staying for longer, then maybe more relaxing to stay in the Hilton which is in a quieter, attractive suburb out of centre. Overall happy with Jolly Carlton

<Content>great central location stayed at the jolly carlton for 2 nights at the end of October 2007. Great central location near the floating flower markets. Easy access to shops , restaurants, trams etc.The hotel has an impressive lobby and helpful staff . We booked a standard double room as we were only there for 2 nights and didn't see the point of paying the extra 50 euro per night for a luxury room. The rooms were small but big enough for our short stay as we were only in the room a couple of hours as there is so much to do and see in Amsterdam.The only below average thing that I saw whilst staying at the jolly carlton were the grotty looking stairwell that didin't seem to belong to the rest of the hotel at all (as I have a fear of elevators I used the stairs daily, and I'm sure that I was the only guest at the hotel that used them). We opted out of paying for the breakfast as we felt it was very expensive for 20 euro each per day (lovely little cafe around the corner that does a full english for 8 euros each)Amsterdam itself is a lovely city with loads to see and do during the day and night. We pre booked an excursion for the Windmills and Edam tour which was a half day (4 hour) excursion It was a pleasant enough trip but we felt that we were being rushed from one place to the other and not having enough time to browse for souveniers in the the shops. Having arrived in Edam (beware shops are closed on Mondays) we only had 45 mins to have lunch and have a look around. We will definately be visiting Amsterdam again and will again stay at the Jolly Carlton because of the great central location.

<Content>Great central hotel This hotel was really great, the rooms were clean, the reception was helpful and the location was excellant. Just round the corner from the floating flower market. We didn't eat in the hotel as there were plenty of restaurants nearby that appealed to us. Getting to and from the airport is easy you can either get on the hotel shuttle bus which was about 12 euros each which drops you off outside your hotel or you get the train from the airport then hop on a tram or get a taxi to the hotel. We would stay in this hotel again and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Be careful wit front rooms Stayed at the Jolly Carlton for two nights. In some respects the hotel contradicts typical American hotels: The rooms are nicer than the lobby. The room was 4-star, although smaller than ordinary rooms on European 4-star hotels. The bathroom was 3-star. We had a room facing Vijzelstraat, which is very busy. Luckily the room was on the 6th floor. The hotel activates air conditioning according to the calendar, not according to outdoor temperature. If you are unlucky enough to have a room on one of the lover floors facing Vijzelstraat, and it is beautiful October weather, you are in trouble. The sun heats the room and the only way of cooling it down is by opening the window鈥攚here the traffic is.HINT: The hotel charges 20 Euros for breakfast. Go instead around the corner to one of the caf茅s facing the Flower Market and have an English breakfast for half the price.

<Content>Never ever again! Booked on internet and stayed here for one night. I chose this hotel because the pickings were slim due to a last minute travel decision, and I seem to recall I had stayed here a few years ago and found it nice. However, I was THOROUGHLY disappointed!! The hotel looks nice, but was really dated inside. Staff was rude - I asked for change to park my car, and they were really reluctant and then finally gave me a bunch of small coins although they had plenty of others. I mean, the least they could do for their guests was to welcome us upon our arrival!! The heat wasn't working properly and I was freezing all night. I asked for a non-smoking room but got a room that smelled like an old bar PLUS it smelled heavily of insecticide. Never again!

<Content>Not Bad, Good Value, Dated but Clean Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Jolly Carlton. The Hotel itself isnt bad, I give it 3 stars out of 5 . The room we got was 2 beds, the beds are not that comfortable, definetly dated. The carpet, room furniture and TV are very dated. But most importantly everything was clean, sheets and bathroom included. The bathroom is actually very nice. We stayed in room 316 , which seemed very lucky since the view was excellent, opening up to a nice little street , and it had a terrace. Internet is expensive in the hotel at .35 Euro per minute. There were about 4 English networks on the TV. Location of the Hotel was superb. Bars,Coffee shops, flower market, shopping , and nice resturants very close. Almost everything is in walking distance - Including Red Light , museums , Brewery and Central Station. The Zoo was a bit of a walk but only because I think we got lost. I would reccomend this hotel for a short, budgeted stay. But if you could afford more and need to be pampered look elsewhere. I would equate it to a Holiday Inn or Best Western in the USA. There is room service from the Italian restaurant beneath the hotel, the restaurant has excellent Brick Oven pizza, there;s also a great Chinese resturant on the corner. There's a Dutch Supermarket called Albert Heijn that is a 2 minute walk and is a great place to pick up snacks for the room. All in all the hotel was satisfactory, the sanitized bathroom is the biggest selling point.

<Content>Would giv it another go, but a bit disappointed with the room Booked this via Lastminute.comArrived in Amsterdam at about 12.00 noon and the hotel took our luggage and dealt with the paperwork. We went and enjoyed the city for a few hours and returned to book into our room. the reception area, lifts etc were pretty impressive and we had read good reviews about the place.we were disappointed when we opened the door to our room to find a nicotine coloured melamine vision from the 70's. The room was spacious enough, as was the bathroom and once we had aired the room and squirted air freshener about it was not so bad. The hotel was conveniently placed, the staff were very helpful and the room was kept clean. It was just those first impressions and the horrible smoky smell that gave it an air of dinginess.Would try this place again on the hope that next time we would be upgraded or have one of the more modern rooms.Did not try breakfast, we went each day to Mc Donalds across the road for a takeaway coffee and to the excellent baker around the corner towards Rembrandt Square for croissants and returned to bed!! :-)

<Content>Very central We stayed at this hotel with friends from 27 September - 1October. Overall it was a good experience. The room was comfortable - albeit a bit small - but we had the option of upgrading to a superior room for 25 euros. The staff were very friendly, particularly the bar staff, including a lovely Irish lady. The tea and coffee making facilities were a bonus for a European hotel, although the cups and spoons were a bit flimsy. Nice tea though. The location was excellent - just next to the floating flower market and close to Dam Square. We would stay there again, but might consider upgrading to a superior room next time if we could afford it.

<Content>Very clean room Staff friendly and helpful. Communal areas and bedroom clean. Reasonable size room (think it was a superior room). Furnishings very drab which made the room seem very dark. Good choice of english speaking channels on TV. Tea making facilities in room but plastic cups and powdered milk. Very good location - easy walking distance from most of the attractions. Overall a good experience, but would have expected a bit more for the money.

<Content>Great location, clean with helpful staff We booked for 4 nights in mid-September as we had previously stayed here 3 years ago. Since then the hotel has been given a face-lift. The rates were higher than normal (we booked through a NL hotel booking site online) due to a big conference taking place during the week but even though they were all busy, the staff were helpful and friendly. For an extra 25 euros a night you can upgrade on arrival to a superior room (50 euros for a deluxe) which is well worth doing if you can! We asked for a room at the front and found it was well sound proofed even though you had the trams and nightlife til late!

<Content>Very pleased Very nice and safe hotel. Flower market is in front of the hotel as well as a vast array of restaurants. Main gay district is just behind the hotel. Everything within walking distance. The farthest we walked (slow walk) was to the Anne Frank house, about 30-40 minutes but every corner has something new to discover. Rooms small but comfotable and extremely clean. Staff is very helpful. Breakfast in the main dining room pricey (euro 15) for what they had but numerous cafes for breakfast around the corner at Rebrandt square.

<Content>Not a 4 star Not a 4 star more like a 3. Our smoking room was basic with peeling and cracked wall paper/plaster. Ask for a room away from the main road otherwise you can hear the trams and cars ect until the early morning. Good location being next to the floating flower market and about 20 minutes walk to Dam Square. Literally round the corner from gay friendly bars and restaurants and coffee shops ect. Not very good choice in TV channels unless you want to spend 13 euros on watching a movie. No price list for the mini bar - a small toblerone was 4 euros i found out on check out.Make sure you have enough coffee and tea ect before housekeeping leave for the evening as although the staff are friendly didnt always have suppliesWould stay there again because of the location but not because of the rooms - would first check the price of the Banks Mansion hotel first though.

<Content>Good Location Unfortunately when I arrived the twin deluxe room I booked was unavailable. The hotel allocated me a standard twin room facing the rear of the property with a view of some offices and a brick wall at the back of the hotel, when I complained about the room I was informed that no deluxe rooms would become available during my stay. I was not offered any compensation for the lower standard of room but as I got a bargain (free upgrade to deluxe room and 20% discount) when booking the hotel, I was less inclined to let this spoil my trip. I feel the hotel gave me the room I paid for, a standard room with no view. The room was very clean and while not tiny it is small. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was hot and powerful. The location of this hotel was ideal within reasonable walking distance of most of Amsterdam鈥檚 attractions. Rembrandtsplein is a 5 min walk and Dam Square is 15 min walk. The hotel is beside the Flower Market and is serviced by the No. 4 9 16 24 25 26 trams at Muntplein.The hotel is very clean and the staff very helpful not withstanding the error in room allocation. I would stay here again as the location is excellent for visiting Amsterdam, but I would have lower expectations on room size and quality.

<Content>What a place! Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Jolly Carlton in Amsterdam and I can honestly say it was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. On arrival we were upgraded to a double deluxe room free of charge and received a good friendly reception.The room was spacious and ultra clean with nice touches that confirmed its 4 star rating. The location was brilliant as the hotel lies between dam square and leidesplein with rembrandtsplein on your doorstep.I booked the hotel through [--] and found a great deal at 317 euros for three nights. Had I not got this deal the rooms would have perhaps been a little pricey.Overall great service and location - would definitely recommend!

<Content>great location great hotel in a great district of amsterdam yet still close enough to all the main attractions to not be out if it.near to the rembrandt square area which is full of bars, coffee shops and restaurants, all of which are really nice, not seedy in anyway and are tourist friendly. Hotel is very clean and spacious, with courteous staff. Didn't have breakfast there as prefer to venture out to tast local treats, and i think i chose wisely. Big local presence which makes you feel like you are on holiday and not trapped in a tourist loop. best place i've stayed in amsterdam

<Content>great location, average room It was a bit confusing when I booked the room on the hotel website as later on I found that the hotel has 2 separate websites. I have not been given a reservation number in the replying email. So I have to make international phone call to make sure the booking is confirmed. (**Use the website which has more details when you make the booking**)We safely arrived and the room (standard) is average. The room is facing the main street with tramlines but with windows closed it is perfectly quiet. The room is a bit small but the beds are very comfortable. Apart from the size there is nothing much to complain.The location is brilliant as it is at the centre of the attractions. It is just next to the tramlines so you can go to anywhere very easily.

<Content>Great Location! Our stay here was great, the location is ideal for enjoying the city. As for the rooms we only had a standard room, it was small but perfectly clean and comfortable. We did not eat in the hotel as breakfast can be found cheaper elsewhere. The small restaurant is reasonable priced but the main restaurant is much more expensive. You have to pay a deposit on arrival if you dont have a credit card. Then the city tax is paid on check out. Overall the room was expensive for what you get but most hotels in amsterdam as priced high.

<Content>not what we expected This was our 2nd visit to Amsterdam, the 1st was a wonderful experience so the standard set was high. Although the hotel itself was clean and the room spacious we found the staff uninterested and unfriendly. Not a lot of smiling faces here, and when we went up to our room after breakfast on the 3rd day we found our key card didn't work. At reception we were told we were down for checking out - we had another 4 days left! - but even so 10am was not the check out time. Staff seemed to tolerate us but not welcome us, so we will not be recommending this hotel or staying with this group again. Last year we were at the Crown Plaza - go there!

<Content>Great Place To Stay The hotel was so nice and clean. It was one of the bigger hotels I stayed at while in Europe. It is located in a great spot with very short walking distances to all of the city's attractions. Don't believe any negative responses about this place. It is a chep price for a great hotel room. Huge bathroom and very clean.

<Content>Nice Comfy Hotel I have never had a bummy hotel, they have all been great. I have stayed in 'The Jolly Carlton' 'The Luxor' 'GT hotel Inntel' 'the Lacanna'. The Jolly Carlton is very comfy and quite plush. I loved all the little extras like dressing gowns and slippers. Breakfast was great. One tip though, its a lot cheaper to book hotel at last minute, as opposed to the airlines being the opposite- they are cheaper to book in advance. One thing that spoiled this hotel. I asked for a nice view and I got a view of a deserted alleyway. It was not good.

<Content>I almost cried.... I am writing this via the expensive, though reliable and fast wireless internet connection. I arrived this morning, full of excitement at being back in Amsterdam for the first time in 22 years. Arriving outside the hotel, I was shocked. It looks terrible, dingy and unkempt. Reception was harried, arguing with some fellow guests over problems with their room. Not a good sign. I then made my way up to my room... to find a shoe box. It was so small that the chairs at the desk do not fit, the door to the bathroom needs to be closed so you can find the toilet, and the decor is very very tired. The corridors are tiny and cramped, and the hotel generally smells stale. The view at the back of the hotel is depressing. I was genuinely shocked at the standard of this hotel. I've just opened the minibar, but not had anything, so will have to see if that pops up on the bill at check out. Positives - the location is simply superb. I walked off my post arrival funk with a good long walk and window shop, and am looking forward to exploring the surrounds tonight with business colleagues. The shower worked well - maybe I was lucky?I have no basis of comparison with other hotels in the area, but I suspect to get the best out of this place, you need to beg, borrow or steal for an upgraded room... which my business booking did not allow. Would I bring my wife and children back? Not to this room....all the best!

<Content>Great Surprise i booked this hotel through Booking.com. I was so pleasantly surprised when I got to the hotel. The hotel is part of the Italian chain. It has all the little luxuries of the Courtyard Marriot. The hotel had a nice big bed (had a double), not 3 twins pushed together, great bathrooms and showers. The location was even better. It was walking distance from everything. I will stay there again when I go to Amsterdam.

<Content>Good experience Stayed here two nights over the bank holiday weekend and had a very good experience. Contrary to other reviewers found the staff very helpfull and polite. Our room was not ready when we arrived so went for a beer in the bar, as we sat having our drink a manager came to find us to tell us our room was ready. The room itself was a superior room and lived up to the billing, on the seventh floor was spacious very clean and had a large balcony. The location is also great, you can walk just about anywhere within fifteen mins, flower market right outside and all the major squares within easy walking. Would certainly return if visiting Amsterdam again. Only thing we were caught out by was the City tax, we prepaid the hotel and although the confirmation said all taxes included we were still hit for 20 Euros on check out, apparently City tax is not included in all taxes according to the receptionist !!

<Content>Quiet, clean, spacious rooms. Excellent Service Most decent hotels in Amsterdam are expensive. Jolly Carlton has a great location. Upon arrival the Service Staff parked our car and assisted with luggage. Very friendly and professional. The room was surprisingly spacious, very clean and quiet, despite facing the busy street and tram line. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>enjoyable stay spent 2 nights at the carlton over queensday 2007and found a good standard room which was spotlessly clean and bigger than i thought it would be the bathroom was especially nice which is always a good guide to a clean hotel the location was great and pretty central for most attractions and nightlife etc without being too noisey reception was quick and easy checking in and out we didnt bother paying for breakfast as booking.com didnt include it in the price and at 15 euro per person found it cheaper to eat out overall if your looking for a clean central 3/4 star hotel this should tick your boxes

<Content>great for everyone! Booked this hotel through hotelconnect.co.uk which had the best price at the time and included breakfast - a lot of the deals from other sites didn't include breakfast.The hotel is fantastic!! In a great location, right at the flower market which is great for gifts and there are shops there that you can get a strippenkaart (for the trams - the little tobacconist is great because they'll show you how to use it). Also, just along from the hotel is the Rembrantplein which is a great area for pubs and restaurants if you're wanting to avoid busy crowds but still enjoy yourself.The hotel itself was such a surprise to me. The room we were in was really big and the bathroom was lovely. The lift always works! which is great because my mum is disabled and we really needed that.The staff are probably the worst point, very snooty. The porters only help you on arrival if you look like you're a tipper, the reception staff are ok but could be a little more helpful. They can be rather frosty.

<Content>Nice hotel Good location We visited this hotel in February for a four day break and booked the hotel via its website. We recieved a free upgrade to the Delux suite, which was very plush, clean and had handy soundproof windows to drown out noise outside. Staff very friendly, good location of hotel and easy to find.We would definately stay here again or one of the other Jolly Hotels.

<Content>Ok, if you like things Small and Basic We have travelled to Amsterdam alot, having stayed at either Banks' Mansion or NH Barbizon. This time (and probably the last time) we thought we'd try something cheaper, as we are never in our room anyway, and how much difference would it make? Quite alot as it turned out. The hotel staff were not very pleasant, the room was tiny, you had to close the door in the bathroom to get to the toilet, the beds were awful and the TV worked when it felt like it - It made alot of difference to our weekend break as we dreaded going back to the hotel. When you're used to 5 star hotels, this place REALLY lets you down. My advise is this - DONT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU ARE USED TO HOSTELS.

<Content>Fantastic Location, good hotel This was our 20th trip to Amsterdam and because we used this website we thought it our obligation to write a review.We have been to a lot of varying star hotels and have never returned to a single hotel twice, however we would definately return to this one......location is perfect, in the middle of everything.When we arrived we were upgraded to a deluxe room and found it to be large and comfortable.Cleaned everyday and quiet at night (we had a room at the back)Lots of bars and restaurants nearby (Remplandt Plein and Leidesplein) one of the main shopping streets just around the corner and ten minutes away from Dam square.

<Content>Could have been Better We stayed there for only 1 night but had not a very good experience. We had booked via some website which confirmed a double bed for us but when we got into our room it was a Twin bed. On contacting the reception they were not really very courteous and advised the hotel was fully booked. I think the location and the spacious room of the hotel is definitely a plus point. On the negatives, it was just the price - i think at 245 euros it was very expensive and not really worth the location or spacious rooms. Would definitely avoid this one in future. I am sure a little more courteous staff who could have arranged us a double bed room would made it a bit better.

<Content>a warm welcome from all at the Jolly Carlton My son and I spent 2 nights at the Jolly Carlton and had a great time. The staff were warm, very friendly and attentive and the location was superb. We arrived early in the morning and although our room wasn't ready for us we were able to leave our case and go off on our travels.The receptionist pointed us in the right direction and advised us to go to the tourist information to buy tickets for the attractions - this way we didn't have to queue (we could walk straight in) and also we were given small discounts - a double bonus.Overall, thanks to the staff at the Jolly Carlton, we had a very enjoyable break - we will definately return and recommend it to all of our friends.

<Content>Customer service was so bad that I would not recommend to anyone We booked online using the hotel's own website and paid the more expensive rate for breakfast at Caruso restaurant (rather than the cafe). However, in the morning, when we arrived in Caruso restaurant, an unfriendly woman asked for our room number. She then said that we had only paid for the cheap breakfast and must go downstairs to the cafe. I told her that was not correct, that I had paid for the more expensive breakfast at Caruso restaurant. She then phoned Reception, who told her that we had paid for the cheap breakfast and must go downstairs to the cafe. I was livid, because I knew that I had paid the more expensive option. So, I took my family and went to our hotel room, to get the print-out of my booking confirmation (showing my Caruso breakfast option prepaid) and marched downstairs to Reception. Reception then agreed, and I went back to Caruso restaurant, for breakfast. Although, I had eventually got into the restaurant, the whole family was extremely angry at the dismal way we had been treated. It was a terrible start to the day and really ruined the hotel stay.I then found out that the breakfast I had to fight to get was complete rubbish - cheap, long-life orange juice, and a rather sparse, unappetising buffet. Then, I wondered what the cheap breakfast at the cafe must be like, and felt glad that I had paid more, because anything worse than that would be inedible.Later that first morning, a lady arrived at our room to check the minibar. She opened the minibar door and then walked out of our room, leaving both minibar fridge and hotel room doors wide open. After she left the room, I called out to ask her if she was coming back or if she was going to leave the fridge door open like that. She said that she was going to get a beer can and return. When she returned and put a beer can into the minibar, I told her that we had not taken anything from the minibar, but she said I only check and replace missing items. She then walked out of the room again, this time she left the outer door to the minibar wide open. She expects guests to close minibar doors after her!Then, to avoid a false charge at chekout, I went to Reception and told them that I had not taken anything from the minibar, and to make sure that I was not charged at checkout. They said they would deal with it.At checkout, guess what? Yes, on the bill was the minibar item. So, my discussion the previous day with Reception had been a complete waste of my time. Luckily, at checkout, the minibar charge was removed, but I didn't want to leave the problem until then, because then there would be greater suspicion that I was not telling the truth.The hotel and corridors are dark, ugly and dated, but inside our room was surprisingly better.To conclude, our stay was marred by the completely dreadful customer service. Staff appear not to have received any training in customer service. There appears to be no understanding by staff as to what makes a stay enjoyable and what makes it annoying. We found that being turned away from the breakfast room and having to produce our proof of eligibility is unforgivable. As a result, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>If You Like Smoking Go Here On arrival one is greeted by a burly doorman who is clearly too busy chatting with a local trader to offer assistance with luggage. We hadreserved two rooms non smoking (that鈥檚 another issue I will come to) The reception personnel advised that although we had requested adjoining or at least next door rooms and our children would be in there and as we always do when travelling like to have them in the next room just in case etc.With 30 minutes of discussion and my patience being pushed to the limit, we were offered rooms opposite each other as these where the only suitable NON SMOKING (remember we reserved non smoking rooms) available.The fifth floor, the non-smoking floor had the strongest tobacco aroma imaginable, we might as well have been beagles in a laboratory!The room, although clean and well maintained, was very warm, on enquiry we discovered that the hotel air conditioning is not turned on for some weeks yet, so you either have stuffy, over heated room with tobacco smells or you open the window to the noise of generatorsand air duct systems of the adjacent office building.The restaurants, in the hotel, which prides itself on being four stars could only be described as cancer chambers, one could not even begin to think of ordering food.

<Content>Jolly Carlton - What a nice surprise ! I was very surprised with what I encountered when I walked into my room at the Jolly Hotel Carlton. I don't know why it's rated so low int this website. This other hotel, that I stayed in the beginning of my trip, rates much higher, and didn't even come close to the Jolly Hotel. I booked a double deluxe room. It was only 20 to 40 euros more than the regular room. I know that 20 to 40 euros a night can add up, but you will be still probably paying less than some of the other hotels in Amsterdam. The other hotel I stayed was more expensive and as I said didn't offer half of what Jolly did.We got a very spacious room with a very spacious bathroom (two sinks and all) facing the back ot the hotel (so it was very quiet). We had robes and slippers in the room for us to use and even chocolate/candy on our pillows every night. The only thing that wasn't included was breakfast, but I think it's pretty much like that all over Amsterdam.The hotel is very well located, between Rembrandt-Plein and Leidseplein. There are excellent restaurants all over the area and great shopping too. The perfect area to stay.

<Content>Fantastic Location, Great hotel This was our third trip to Amsterdam and we normally stay in a 5 star hotel up at Central Station, for this trip we were with friends so decided to change hotel.The hotel was extremely easy to find and looked pleasant enough from the outside. The foyer and check in area were very nice and check in was extremely quick and all questions were answered.The rooms were a little small however we were given a 7th floor room with a large balcony area which provided excellent views over Amsterdam. The rooms were immaculately clean and were maintained to this standard every day. The onyl downside to the room was a lack of a personal safe, however we did not have a single problem with security and when i returned to the room one day to collect something the cleaner asked to check my key card before allowing me entry which certianly laid my mind to rest. The staff in the hotel were also excellent and were happy to supply maps, travel information etc... and always did so with a smile. The guys in the foyer were great for organising taxis and luggage as well.Without a doubt this is the best location we have stayed in Amsterdam, everything is within walking distance due to its central location. The setting in the flower market and close to Spui and Rembrandtsplein make for a very nice area to stay in and quiet at night.We didnt eat or have breakfast in the hotel due to the abundance of cafes and restaurants to eat in in the flower market and within walking distance. I would/will go back to the Jolly Hotel no problem at all.

<Content>Location is tops! A very nice hotel for Amsterdam! First of all, I will provide directions to the hotel from the airport. DO NOT take a taxi from the airport unless you don't mind paying through the nose. Taxi fare from the airport is 40 EUROS. Avoid taxis at all costs in Amsterdam.. The metres run like a cheetah!! Initial fare is 5 euros and it just skyrockets from there in the blink of an eye! I couldn't believe it. Become familiar with the streetcar system in the city.. it is very easy to follow and wonderfully convenient. The streetcar is your friend!!Instead of taking taxi from airport, I recommend the following to reach the Jolly Carlton Hotel:1. Take train from the airport to CENTRAL STATION2. Buy a StripKaart (I think that's what it's called) or pay cash fare of about 1.60 Euros and take the Tram # 4 or #9.3. Ask to be dropped off near the FLOWER MARKET.Hotel is about a 2 minute walk from here.Anyway, on to the hotel ... Location is amazing. You can walk to virtually every major tourist spot within 10-15 mins. Staff is friendly and the hotel is clean and well decorated. There is a nice bar on the ground floor which overlooks the street - very nice place to relax and have a beer while people watching. The bartenders and staff at the bar were very friendly. although i did not eat there, the food that neigboring tables were being served looked quite delicious. Noise from the street is tolerable. We were on the 3rd floor on weekend nights and, with the windows shut we really had no trouble sleeping. Breakfast at the hotel was unreasonably expensive at 15 Euros. All I had was cereal and some juice. Perhaps I should have eaten more if I had known I was going to be charged that amount! Even still, 15 euros is excessive for breakfast, even by London England standards. A great place to eat is just on the way to Rembrandt square called Wok to Walk. very nice, cheap, and quick food if youre on the run and don;t want to spend too much money. Very nice smokeshop that was featured in the movie OCean's 11 is locted within a 5 minute walk: DAMPKRING. You can sit at the same table that Brad Pitt and Matt Damon sat on during filming! I don't smoke, but this place came very highly recommended (no pun intended) by a local friend of mine. Apparently the quality of product, atmosphere, and crowd are the best in the city. I thought I would share this pearl of wisdom with you in case you like to indulge.

<Content>Great hotel! We went to this hotel in November 2005, and had a fabulous time!!Got a very reasonable rate on lastminute.com - about 拢400 for two people, 3 nights and 2 flights.Room was great - very clean, bright and airy. Staff were very pleasant, and the location was excellent - very close to both Dam/Rembrantplein squares, and floating flower market etc.All the staff were very friendly and helpful.Didnt eat in the hotel - looked a bit overpriced and there are so many nice places to eat in Amsterdam that you dont need to eat at the hotel.Overall a really nice stay in the hotel - would definately visit again!

<Content>Great Hotel - Except for the Guy at the Front Desk Great hotel. Modern, clean amenities. Excellent location. The hotel is quite booked Friday nights and check out time is not until Saturday noon. Rooms don't get cleaned and become available not until around 1PM or 2PM. So, if you're arriving Saturday morning from an overseas flight with a bad jet lag, you just can't hang around the hotel lobby - worse if you happen to fall asleep on the coach, at which point, the guy at the front desk will rudely wake you up to say no sleeping allowed. The same guy wouldn't even take the effort to tell you when your room becomes available. Other than that, great hotel, excellent value.

<Content>best location in dam Stayed in the Jolly for 3 nights found the staff were really friendly and helpful. apart from the mini bar attendant stole a bottle of wine and it got put on our bill. [--] but when I phoned they took it off straight away. the best part about this hotel is its situated right in the centre of Amsterdam in the best place possible. Its next to rambrant plein which is a massive square with escape which is a 2000 capacity club, also many ather clubs and bars. You can walk from the hotel to most museums and sights on foot and its only ten minutes walk to the red light district just ask at the hotel for a map. We never ate in the hotel as being Amsterdam we were always out but there are loads of restaurants around. We went to a thai cafe called Butterfly thai cafe on Oudezezuds Achterburgwal street. Same street as the hash museum just after the red light distrcit. It was better than a lot of the resaurants in thailand, try the Tom Yum soup and the fish was bom. The room we stayed in was quite small and we never had a view but we never asked. the room, lifts and whole hotel was very clean and the lobby looked good. I will be goinig again next year without my girlfriend so I can go mad..

<Content>good hotel good location Having read some of the most recent reviews I was a bit apprehensive about what I might find on arrival.I have to say, however , staying in this hotel was a very pleasant experience.The receptionists I dealt with were efficient and helpful. The non smoking room on floor 1 was bright and airy and spotlessly clean.I got a very good rate through alpharooms which included breakfast. There was quite a substantial hot and cold buffet on offer. Location was excellent - easy to walk to anne frank house,museums, etc + a lot of reasonably priced restaurants in vicinity.Only negative was the taxi driver at central station who tried (unsucessfully) to rip me off by asking 15 euro to the hotel. In conclusion a good 4* hotel which was certainly value for money

<Content>Good Location, Tiny Room Bad, Breakfast Brilliantly located hotel close to everything good for somewhere to sleep. Stayed 3 nights over new year period. Got breakfast to the room and cost 50euros and it was, well lets just say not pleasant and not what i had ordered. From the outside the hotel looks massive and very worth the money. The lobby area just adds to your expectations as is very luxurious and welcoming. Howver cant say the same for the rooms appearance was quite dingy - although a smoking room not very luxurious hideous pictures on the wall and absolutley tiny booked a Double room and was given 2 beds joined together. Hotel staff very friendly although some housekeepers seemed a little grumpy. Was not in the hotel much They do have a restaurant but cant comment on that as never went due to the 50 euros i paid for breakfast. There is a cafe situated in the lobby which serves a nice coffee though. The goos thing is this hotels location right nxt to the flower market and shoping centre. Dam square, Red Light etc all within about 10mins walking distance. Great hotel for location but rooms and room service not up to much.

<Content>HIGHS and lows and some friendly advise. like the other reviews reveal, this hotel is a mixed bag. On the plus side, is its central location at the tip of the 'tongue' and at the center of the centrum. the neighboring and defining flower market is both kind of cheesey but endearing especially when you see how a couple tullips can brighten up your room. the van gogh museum is a walk and sometimes a taxi is more appealing but expensive at @ 9euro from this location. the rooms and halls really need attention. Americans won't be satisfied with the standard rooms which are like cells with windows. we paid the extra 25euro upgrade to the delux/superior rooms which are twice the size and very hospitable and our particular room on a high floor enjoyed colorful views with lots to see. I would recommend the hotel combine the small rooms into small suites, for familes. dinner on chrismtas eve at the excelsior a restaurant across the river was excellent, and the hotel was near some other good restaurants; however, the services the jolly hotel offered need a little attention, for instance there is a 8euro service charge for mediocre room service with top tier menu prices too. the beds and bedding were a little flat and seemed worn and of questionable quality , the halls were a little dark with low ceilings. the front desk was uneven. some people were very helpful others perhaps not so much, but in general i enjoyed my stay at the hotel however i don't see myself staying there again, but the hotel does offers some advantages because of its location, (sometimes too) informal and friendly staff and reasonably priced accommodations. I could the see this hotel getting better with classic refurbishment and some thoughtful redesign. 2.5 stars but could be higher with some inprovements.

<Content>brillient location i read some shocking reviews about this hotel and went there anyway. i like to make my own mind up. i travelled to amsterdam with my 5 year old daughter. we had a fantastic time. amsterdam is not for adults only. so the jolly hotel, what can i say. the location was brillient. our double room was clean and comfortable with an en suite. i had trouble with the shower but phoned reception and they sorted it immediately. a bonus for us was the tv which received bbc 1 and 2. this just kept my daughter entertained whilst we spent brief periods in the hotel. we basically slept there. i'm sure you could get cheaper elsewhere, but travelling alone with a 5 year old i wanted to know we were going back somewhere comfortable. to sum up - clean, comfortable, all staff very friendly, location fantastic for me and my daughter,could be a little cheaper but we knew the deal!

<Content>Great hotel Me, my husband and a friend have just come back from a quick weekend break in Amsterdam. The hotel was enough - the staff were very friendly. The rooms could definately do with un upgrade. We had a room with a balcony with a lovely view over the city. We didn't eat in the restaurant but chose the Italian across the road which was lovely - the food was really tasty. Breakfast at the hotel was very basic - probably a better idea to go out for breakfast.I would recommend this hotel, it has a great location and wonderful staff. The rooms are very comfortable with everything you need.

<Content>Hotel Jolly Not too clean My husband and I spent 3 nights at this hotel in September.The location was good and we found we could easily walkto all the tourist attractions in Amsterdam - another plus was thetram line just outside the hotel door. All this was good - but probably not too hard to find in Amsterdam as it is fairly easy to negotiate. The staff were friendly and tried to help with directions and complaints. We got the feeling that they were frustrated by a couple of our complaints as it seemed they had heard them before and they have not been dealt with by management. The literature in our room had the wrong time displayed for breakfast times.We arrived and they were packing up - when we pointed this out to the manager she begged us to talk to hotel management because she had had many complaints and nothing had been done about it. The hotel foyer has obviously been updated - but not the rooms.The rooms and hallways are tired and in fact, a little dirty. Our bedspread was grubby and the bathroom was tired as well.It was not the worst hotel I have stayed in but I wouldn't recommend it. Not such a Jolly stay.

<Content>good rooms, great location We stayed at the jolly last year, we travelled with another couple so I booked 2 rooms on the internet. I took advice from another reviewer, on tripadvisor, and emailed the Jolly hotel chain with a request for a room with nice views etc, I got an email back to say that my request had been noted, I took this as a no, but on arrival both our rooms had been upgraded at no extra cost. Just as well, because we sneaked a look at the standard rooms when the cleaners were in and I must say they looked rather on the small side. The room we had was spacious with large bathroom, the downside was that it had dark decor, but to be honest we hardly spent anytime in the room, I wonder why I bother paying extra for nice hotels. There are loads of pubs and restaurants nearby, and you are right next to rembrantplein square. There is an italian across the road which is very popular and quite expensive, it has a good atmosphere but I was quite disapointed with the meal, the indian next door to it was good though, although I was drunk at the time! We never ate at the hotel, too much choice on the doorstep. Overall a good experience.

<Content>Bad experience... I just got back from a four night stay in the Jolly Carlton in Amsterdam. I was very dissapointed due to the fact that I paid $300 Euros a night and the hotel was terrible, the ac didn't work and it took them 24 hours to resolve the problem, the room was tiny and could barely fit a suitcase, the drain in the shower was clogged, when I got there I had to bring my bags into the reception since the bellboy never greeted me outside. They never bothered to get me a cab (they just told me to stand outside and they would drive by) and last but not least they never woke me up after I arranged a wake up call for 7am. The decor is relly poor and I believe this was more of a 2 star that should charge $90 Euros instead of $300'.Sincerely,Rachel Franco

<Content>Great location This is a quiet hotel in a very central location. Our room was good size and had an updated bathroom. The staff members speak English and seemed nice. The mini bar does charge you when you open it (we just had them take the charges off the bill - no problem). We used the fridge for our own food. Don't eat at the first-floor restaurant. Not good and overpriced. The Caruso Restaurant is great. I wouldn't rate this as a 4-star hotel; more of a 3.

<Content>Fantastic After booking the trip and hotel and reading the reviews on the site, I was expecting the worse and when I got there, I found it to be a really pleasant experience. The room we had was really spacious and the bathroom was large enough for 2 people (with two sink basins) and the bed could've accommodated 4 people! I found it a bit noisy at night around 4am when drunken people were shouting in the street but overall, found the hotel to be excellent. I got a good price for the trip and the hotel seemed to be a bargain. It is in a fantastic location and we walked everywhere for 3 days and I highly recommend the Indonesian restaurant around the corner next to the Flower Market. Would definitely recommend!

<Content>Dingy - rude, aggressive receptionists The hotel has OK common areas however the rooms are dingy, old and smell of damp.Do not be misled by the 4 star. Expect a down-at-heel 3 star and you wont be disappointed.However the real low point is the italian workers in reception who are the most outrageously rude and unhelpful I have have experienced in Europe.They are pointlessly aggressive and argumentative.Avoid - if there are other options available.

<Content>Not a Four Star We stayed for two nights on 24 August. Good location close to tram stop. The hotel is monolithic and unattractive but a friendly welcome from reception staff who freely gave directions and told us not to have the hotel breakfast and go to one of the abundant restaurants by the floating flower market, two minutes away. Those breakfasts were excellent and half the price of the hotel fare.The room was just like a British Post House Hotel in the 80's. Small, clean but in dire need of remodelling. Comfortable large bed, clean but small bathroom well stocked with toilet items. No room for two in the bathroom. Tea and coffee in room but with horrible plastic cups. Room smelled of cleaning fluids but at least, was clean. Happily did not experience previous correspondents' problems with the hot water.Room 503 is at the back of the hotel (as many are). The hotel straddles a street containing many bars and a nightclub which appears open until 5am. Incredibly noisy with many drunks and revellers shouting and screaming. I guess that's Amsterdam but you could find quiter hotels, I'm sure.A three star hotel masquerading as a four star.

<Content>Great Location - only minor problems The Jolly Carlton is a very well situated hotel as nearly everyone has mentioned. Sitting right beside the flower market its less than 10 minutes walk from both Dam Square and Leidseplein. It really couldnt be much better located and unless you're planning to spend all your time laying in the hotel then that really is the main thing.The reception staff are helpful and the lobby of the hotel is very welcoming. The room we had was clean and whilst not huge it wasnt cramped either. As with other people, the double we had ordered turned out to be two single beds with seperate sheets etc. After trying this on the first night and drifting far apart we requested a change to a double bed. Whilst not being able to accomodate us for the second night they moved us after that for the rest of the stay. Whilst the 'double' again was 2 singles at least they had joined the beds with a single sheet etc and the drifting apart was cured. The reception staff through all of this were very accomodating and moved luggage etc between rooms.I only experienced one slight problem with the water temperature when it seemed to jump up for a moment, but in 4 days of 2 people showering twice a day that was the only occasion .If you do need to take a tram then there is a stop about 50m from the front door of the hotel which is very handy for taking a tram up to Centraal Station or down to the museums area. Overall the hotel is clean, very well located and a great base for exploring Amsterdam. It really only misses out on 5 stars very narrowly and I would happily recommend it to anyone going given the very reasonable price we got (4 nights for price of 3) through lastminute[--].

<Author>Maybeitsbecause
<Content>good location, shame about the decor would agree with all the other comments posted below - the Jolly is certainly in an excellent location, right by the flower market. The room was quite large and air-conditioned and despite overlooking the main road was very quiet, which ensured a good nights sleep. However the decor is terrribly dated and needs up-grading from the eighties style. Bathrom looked a little bit grubby and I also noted that having made my bed the housekeeping had just flung my pyjamas onto a side table which seemed a little slapdash. Reception seemed friendly although we did not have to bother them much, they were efficient in organising a shuttle bus to the airport for us whiich arrived promptly and was much better value at 12 euros each than the rip-off taxi we had taken earlier on. Our hotel offer did not include breakfast which seemd a little steep for 12 euros - lots of much better cafes around. Lastly, there was a very strange arrangement with the minibar which was locked. If you opened it you were charged - even if you did not drink anything. If you wanted to cool any of your own drinks, they charged 15 euros to empty the minibar, which I thought was a bit strange! Overall a satisfactory hotel but I probably wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Jolly in Amsterdam You cannot beat the location here for this hotel in Amsterdam. It was also very quiet at night despite being on a tram line and with the flower market etc. Breakfast is mega-expensive, go for the cafe's down in the road in Rembrandtsplein instead. Staff are extremely helpful and polite and you can get a bus to Schipol from the hotel door if you like (Connexxion bus). Rooms were small but were clean. Rather expensive for the room but all hotels in Amsterdam seem to be around the same, even for worse locations.

<Content>Fantastic Location We stayed in the jolly carlton hotel for 3 nights. it was within walking distance to dam square and the main shopping street it was in a perfect location. The weather was very hot when we said (28 degrees) but our rooms had air conditioning so that was a major bonus. The rooms were fresh and clean and the staff were very helpful. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was over priced but there are so many cafes and restaurants along the canals. I would recommend the Jolly Carlton Hotel 100%. Loved it

<Content>Nice Hotel, Good location I booked here at short notice through a website for 109 euro which is good for Amsterdam at the moment. I had a room with a view over the flower market and Muntplein. Reception staff were freidly and efficient. The room was smallish butcontained everything needed inc. tea/coffee and safe. Both room and bathroom were clean and well maintained.The bad points were the queen bed was 2 singles which drew apart during the night(very romantic!) and the shower going from perfect to scalding to freezing, that they really should fix. If not for this i would give 4*

<Content>Good location, and some rooms are a (nice) surprise The rates for this hotel can vary a lot. I got a room for 109 鈧?which was very low, so even if below I give some remarks, the value for money was excellent.LOCATIONThe hotel is on a busy street, and even the small road under the hotel lead to a busy area (small restaurants, ...). The flower market, tramline, shopping streets, canals, are all very close and easy to find. This is not a 'calm location' so be ready for some noise.RECEPTIONMy check inn was fast and efficient.The lifts come quite fast.ROOMThe corridors feel a bit a like a 3 star hotel from the seventies, but they are clean. My room turned out to be a big suite with 2 single beds, a huge writing desk, a seperate luggage room with a safe, a nice bathroom, and all of this with a business atmosphere. Everything as clean, modern and in working order. I don't think all rooms are like this, but at least 507 is. Be aware : the remarks other users of this side made about fluctuating water temperatures are correct. Better take a bath, not a shower.FACILITIES and RESTAURANTMy stay was too short to test some of the other facilities.

<Content>Great Location Great 4 days in Amsterdam. This is a hotel that is in the middle of everything. All the city attractions are within easy reach of this hotel. You could walk, tram or bike anywhere. The rooms are small but adequate. Read the review about the water and they are true, be very careful. Staff a friendly and helpful. Only problem was we got a smoking room our first night when we asked for non smoking. Was put in a deluxe room which was great except for the stale odour. We moved the next night to a box room on top floor. The room was fine and clean. It is a 3* hotel and nothing more. We got a really good deal to stay here but I don't think it is worth the price they normally charge. If you can get a good deal at this hotel, I would recomment staying here as it is a great base to explore Amsterdam.

<Content>Great location,average room My wife and I stayed 3 nights. Great location near the tram lines and central Amsterdam. Room was small (its Europe), barely big enough for the bed, which was comfortable. Breakfast was overpriced. Plenty of dining options all around hotel.Staff extremely pleasant and helpful. The shower has a sign about the hot water...it can get scalding with no warning, they mean it! Be nimble. I thought it was a little too expensive for the room (180 euro) but I waited too late for reservations.

<Content>Great stay at the Jolly Carlton, Amsterdam Just returned from a great stay at the Jolly Carlton hotel in Amsterdam. The hotel is in an excellent location- right beside the Flower market. It's a central location- not too noisy or seedy at night. My stay at the hotel was absolutely perfect-- very friendly staff who upgraded us to a deluxe room free of charge and without even mentioning it. The room was spacious and nicely furnished. large bathroom (shower good-- no problems with the hot water at all). We didn't have breakfast there as we wanted to get to places (e.g. the Caravaggio-Rembrandt ex. at the Van Gogh musuem) early, before the crowds.I would completely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again. Amsterdam is a brilliant city and the Dutch people are the friendliest and most polite people in Europe!!

<Content>good location we have just returned from a 5 day stay at the jolly carlton,the location is great,the hot water supply is very tempremental and on occasions can get VERY hot,our room was not cleaned until on average 3.30pm daily although the maid usually woke us up at about 8.15 am humming and singing as she went up and down the corridor,at night it could be noisy from the street below ,on the first night we couldnt open the mini-bar and on reporting this we were told that the bars in the town were open until 5.00am ,not the answer we wanted really,we had breakfast once in our room for which the service charge is 8 euros, we found that there were better and cheaper options in the many eating places nearby. ,how-ever it was not all negative and we did enjoy our stay ,the reception staff were help-full and the rest of the staff very pleasant,the hotel is within easy walking distance of dam square,central station,and right next door to the floating flower market.

<Content>A decent 4-star hotel I stayed at the Jolly Hotel Carlton from February 19th to 22nd, 2006. I requested and received a nonsmoking room which was really nonsmoking--never quite guaranteed when you are in Europe. I should add that I only paid about $110 a night via hotels which was quite a bargain. The service was formal but adequate. Knowing Italian is a plus here because half the staff is from Italy, particularly those who work at the restaurant. That said, the reception desk people speak perfect English, and so does the hotel operator. Breakfast costs something like 12 Euros extra, but because I already knew this from the website, I never tried it. There are some wonderful pastry and coffee shops just down the street, like Kweekboom on Reguliersbreestraat, so you really have no reason to pay big bucks for a hotel breakfast unless you really wish to. There are two restaurants and a grand cafe on the premises. I tried the cheaper restaurant (not Caruso) and was decidedly underwhelmed by the service and the food. Between that and the fat surcharge you would have to pay for room service here (8 Euros above the price of the meal--which works out to $25 for pizza from room service), you're best off eating at any of the nice restaurants within a few steps.The location is pretty good, just steps from the 4 and 9 tram Muntplein stop, which is very useful. You do _not_ need to take a cab to get here until after 12:30 am when the trams stop. And even then, because the hotel is only two blocks from Dam Square, you probably won't be too far to begin with in this compact city.Everyone's reviews already forewarned me about the weirdness of the hot water service in the bath. Jolly even puts stickers in the shower to let people know that on occasion the water can get scalding hot. It happened to me once during a shower. Basically, be prepared to step away from the water and turn the temperature down when necessary. That said, the bathroom was clean and the water really was hot. And the towels were fresh and plentiful. And again, you're never guaranteed any of those things in Europe, even at some places that call themselves four star.Basically, this was a good, solid four star hotel. I would consider returning, but given the choice, I think I would try out Dikker  Thijs Fenice because it's cheaper, includes breakfast, and is right next to the 1/2/5 tram line stop, which gets you to more places you might be interested in. However, Amsterdam is so compact, you can basically stay almost anywhere in the city center and get wherever you want to go. You just might have to walk an extra two blocks to get the tram you want.

<Content>Great Location My Partner and I stayed at the Jolly Hotel Amsterdam for during the weekend 11-13 Feb 2006. Hotel was Average.Not sure if its really a 4* more of a 3*+. The staff were OK but to be honest we did not trouble them much.The room was Double. Not the biggest I have stayed in but it did the job. I was given a twin at first but had to request a change for a double, this took around 20 mins to arrange. Check in was 2pm, we got there a bit early but still had to wait for the rooms to be prepared... Not nice if you have just come in from a long flight etc... Be very careful of the showers, other reports of Hot and Cold temp are very true. Nearly burt myself as the shower temp went from nice and warm to boling hot !! .. (there are warning stickers)The hotel was clean. Room keeping did a good job. There was soom minor maintainance going on the 6th Floor ( some sort of re-wiring but not noisy at all).Did not eat or drink in the hotel.There are more then enough places to eat and drink within easy walking distance. (Studio2 opp the Flower Market do a nice Full English at half the hotel rate) and there is a McDonalds across the road for late night munchies !The MiniBAR came with enough warnings and locks to be honest it put me right off even trying to see what was in there!The only thing that is worth writing about is the location. It very centrally located for walking. We covered most areas on foot and never felt we walked too much. We walked to Central Station too, its about 10 mins walk. Used web hotel booking service to get a discounted rate..Would stay again, if the price was better... mainly because of location. Stayed in the Marriot before which weighed slighty higher ( because of views over Leidseplien).

<Content>Jolly Carlton Review The Hotel is in a great location easy walking distance to all areas of attractions and interests. The Hotel Lobby is beautiful and looks ritzy. My room that my husband and I stayed in was small, very small. Housekeeping was GREAT, they cleaned the room everyday gave fresh towels, made the beds and filled up the coffee, it was awesome. The Doormen were great and always were very polite and made us feel at home. I wasn't very happy with the front desk staff they were sort of short with you if you had any questions to ask them. Overall we enjoyed our stay at The Jolly Carlton HOtel and probably would go back but upgrade our room to a bigger room if there is one and ask for a better view ours was of a roof overlooking some buildings.

<Content>This would have been a 5* rating but we were charged for damage we didn't do!!! We spent 3 nights at this hotel on a 3 for the price of 2 deal with Superbreaks. Very good location, and the staff were extremely helpful. Room clean and tidy with balcony albeit it was a bit too chilly to use the balcony at this time of year. Shower temperature a bit tempramental (as per other reviews). However on returning home to the UK I discovered that my credit card had been charged 拢70 (100 euros) for smoke damage to a non-smoking room. We are both non-smokers and did not cause any damage! No joy at present disputing this with the hotel who have a Report/photos claiming to be our room. So, our reasonably priced weekend break has just got considerably more expensive as its our word against theirs! CHECK YOUR ROOM THOROUGHLY!!!! I think this is probably a scam they do to claw back money from cheap breaks. Otherwise I would have highly recommended the hotel to all friends and family...

<Content>4 star disguised as a 2 star This was an over-priced hotel. The service was terrible, cold-fish who made you feel guilty for asking a question. They charged horendous fees for everything.... if they are a luxury hotel should wireless internet not be standard? Or how about local calls? The fact the flimsy curtains wouldnt close, or the fact the shower would go from SCALDING hot to frigid.... and when we called they said that all the showers do that.... but without turning the dial? I was 5mos pregnant and the shower just about launched me to the floor because it got so scalding half way through my shower. The staff didn't care. The breakfast was WAY over priced (I suggest going for a 2min walk across the street, there is a greatlittle cafe). Other then the location, this was a 2 star, advertising and priced to try and pretend to be a 4 star.

<Content>Nice Place, Met all of my needs.... I just returned from a 5 night stay in Amsterdam at the Jolly Carlton Hotel. I really enjoyed my stay there. This was my 3rd trip to AMS and the most enjoyed. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is in the center of it all, everything the dam has to offer is within a mile or so radius. The room was decent sized, 2 twin beds pushed together, full bath with a tub large enough to hold me a 6'2 man, minibar, and my room even had a little balcony where you could go out and have a smoke. Decent restaraunts in area, I recomend the Indoesian  Chinese places on the corner, as well as the breakfast at the hotel, nice spread for 12 euro. I would stay here again and would recomend this place. 2 thumbs up!

<Content>Crap service My partner  I stayed at the Jolly Carlton January 2006. Great room, loved the location (right by the Bloemenmarket) but the service was appalling. On one day our room was not cleaned until we complained about it about on our return at 4.30; my partner was scalded by a surge of boiling water whilst in the shower which was only suppressed by a continued application of cold sponges.When we complained about it, they stuck a notice in the shower area warning of the hot water! And then to cap it all, on our final day, with a check out time of noon, we packed most things away and went out leaving a few items that we needed, out. In marked contrast to previous days, our room was cleaned on time and the items that had been left out thrown out. It was only thanks to reception and housekeeping that most of the items were recovered from the garbage. 4 star? NOT!

<Content>Brilliant Hotel - would recommend to anyone We have just returned from a very pleasant 3 night stay at the Jolly Carlton in Amsterdam during the period between Christmas and New Year. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were very polite, friendly and couldn't do enough for you. The room was more than adequate for our needs. It was clean and tidy and as there was a thermostat in the room, the temperature was just right. We were on the 7th floor so noise was not a problem. There was a big choice at breakfast and again the staff were very friendly and quick to take your order for hot drinks and the made to order omelettes, scrambled eggs etc. The hotel was in a perfect location to explore all the sights in Amsterdam. It was just over 5 minutes walk to Dam Square and a couple of minutes away from Rembrantplein where there were lots of bars, clubs and restaurants. I will definitely stay that this hotel on our next trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Absolutly loved the Hotel Jolly We stayed at the jolly from 26th dec to 30th dec. We were a bit apprehensive as we had read a few negative reviews,we needn't have worried, as soon as we entered the hotel we new this was going to be an enjoyable stay. The hotel is fabulous, absolutely spotless and the most efficient we have ever stayed inWhen we booked in we were upgraded free of charge )and without asking ) to a superior room, a porter took our bags and escorted us to our room which was huge and gorgeous, We had 2 4ft beds side by side, there was a bath robe and slippers for the lady. Plenty of tea and coffee, and a sweet with a message by our beds. The bathroom was lovely really big with 2 was basins, shower and a bath. Ther was a hairdryer, but this was in the bathroom so you had to stand I think they could put a stool in there, as usual with foreign hotels there was no plug by a mirror in the lounge so couldnt use own hairdryer, I gave up and stood. After we unpacked we went down stairs and the manager asked us if we liked our room, we thought this was a real personel touch . All the staff were really friendly as were all the dutch. It was freezing cold in Amsterdam so the warm hotel was very welcoming, heating is on in the rooms 24hrs, you can turn it to whatever temperature you want. When we booked out we left our luggage in the hotel, I have never seen this done so proffesionaly your bags were tagged and we were given a duplicate.Anything really valuable was put behind the desk and locked up. We would not stay in a different hotel if we go back to amsterdam.We took the schipol shuttle from the airport they are every half hour from the airport, we had a return cost 35 euros (拢24total) for 2 of us right to the jolly. The hotel cost us 拢284 total for the room ,that 拢35 each per nt, booked with cheeptravel or cheephotels on net (spelt as seen)Fab Stay

<Content>A hotel where "EFFICIENCY" is the keyword While on a stopover in Amsterdam this time I booked the Jolly hotel Carlton for a cheaper rate than the Grand Krasnapolsky hotel and the Victoria which in the past was a dissapoitement in terms of services and price, so I took a crack at the Jolly hotel Carlton this time and believe me, it was diferrence.Upon arrival, I was greeted professionaly by a seasoned receptionist who would normally attribute the lousiest room since the booking was done through an internet base hotel reservation which could obtain rates not even proposed by a travel agent, and my rate was very low (which is logical to me).They notice that I was walking with a crutch, they immediately upgrade my room to a supperior one which is located on the first floor.In front of the room, things started badly as the magnetic key didn't syncronise with the room lock, so it was back to the reception and a change of key card, this time accompanied by the porter, I was finnaly in the room.I was surprised. First becauce through getting cheap rate with a rack rate going over 300 and they really gave me a superior room which I went over carefully, from the bathrooms (a large one , the minibar , the coffee making facilities to the options for internet connection and found nothing wrong with the except maybe the soundproof windows which was difficult to shut, but well nevermind, I got a decent room for once and will certainly not complained about it.The bathrooms was even equiped with a shower stall with a seat for people who are not that strong with there legs.After a shower and a very comfortable sleep, it was panic in the morning as I forgot to bring my shaving kit, I call housekeeping who replied she will see what she could do and less that 5 minutes later, the doorbell rang and it was room service with box containing a shaving kit.Upon arriving at the reception for the checkout, the staff was polite and total checkout time including the fact that I booked throught the internet, but want to pay for the rooms upon checkout took less than 5 minutes while the staff asked if my stay at there hotel was alright and when i told them I would prefer to stay here than the Grand Krasnapolsky, it was all a proud smile.All in all this was the best hotel for me in Amsterdam in comparing with other top name hotels.On the positive side, the staff is very efficient and the rooms well equiped and well maintained except for the magnetic key lock and the soundproof window which didn't shut very well, I would personnaly stay here again for these reasons: I got a very good room for the price I paid, a friendly and efficient staff and situated 3 tramways stop or by walking the main shopping street Kalverstratt, the hotel is located at the end of this street.Location, prices (if available), fully equipped rooms and of course the excellent staff, I rate it the best.

<Content>Fabulous central location We stayed here for a long weekend, and had a great time. The rooms were plenty big enough, and had great freebies (always a plus!!).The staff on front desk were polite  efficient. We were taken a little by surprise by the hotel tax charge on leaving, which was in addition to the hotel room charge that we'd paid up front - lucky we hadn't spent everything!We didn't eat in the restaurant at all - bit pricey, and there was plenty of other places to go that were extremely close. Likewise, it wasn't a problem being room only, because there were plenty of places to go for breakfast.All in all we had a great time in the Jolly hotel, and we'd definitely go again.

<Content>Incompetent and not very helpful Interesting to read other reviews where this hotel has messed up their bookings. I recently booked a weekend at the Jolly Carlton, got email confirmation of the booking and travelled there on a Friday night only to be told that there was a problem with my booking and the hotel was full. They claimed they'd tried to call me, though I'd received no phone calls or voicemails, it then transpired that they'd done it an hour beforehand (i.e. while I was on the plane). The guy behind the desk didn't really want to know, his line was that they'd failed to authorise my credit card and so cancelled the booking. I don't believe this for one moment (my credit card provider usually notifies me about anything like this), especially as there were two couples at reception when I arrived who seemed to be having a similar problem, it seems more likely they'd overbooked and just bumped a few guests randomly. The guy reluctantly found me another hotel which was miles from the centre and wasn't happy when I refused it.I can't comment on the hotel itself, all I saw was the reception but I can confidently say they're inefficent, uninterested and not very helpful. I will not be booking this one ever again.

<Content>Perfect location - good value The hotel was a great location! The rooms were clean and comfortable - although not as big as Americans are used to, but more than enough for two people. The staff was nice, and even though our room faced a busy street, the windows were so thick we couldn't hear a thing. I would definitely stay(and will be staying) here again!

<Content>great location, great rooms I was very pleased with our stay at the Jolly given the mixed reviews on this site. We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights at the end of October 2005 and could not fault the service or the room. The location is fantastic to be able to walk around the city in any direction. Takes 5 mins to walk to Dam square. We were on the 6th floor at the back and had no problems with noise. The only thing that I could say to improve on was the hairdryer. If your the kind of person that relies on one in the morning then I would suggest you take your own.Great service and I would stay here again

<Content>Excellent stay From the moment we entered the hotel our every need was catered for. The staff were friendly  efficient and bent over backwards to help us.A high class 4* hotel.The hotel is clean and in a good state of repair and our rooms were wonderful!!! clean, well sized etc and we were allocated a free upgrade.Breakfast was excellent and the service could not be faulted.We have stayed in Amsterdam on a number of occasions and this hotel was the best by miles.

<Content>Location,location.... With so many choices I decided after my Milano Jolly Hotel experience to do it again, but in the Dam. My first Deluxe room was small and overlooked the street. Spent 2 nights in this room and then upgraded to a quiet, larger Superior room. What a difference 50 Euros made. Ate breakfast in their Italian style restaurant- great Italian waiters- a little bit of real Italy in Amsterdam. Beyond easy to navigate around the city from this hotel. The flower market was a great way to ask for directions back to the hotel.The weather was warm for October , and the A/C had been previously shut off and heat was available. Didnt use it but it was a little warm in the room. Not the fault of the hotel.I doubt Ill be returning to Amsterdam but if I do I'll surely add the Jolly Carlton to my itinerary.

<Content>WIFI people MUST read this Am currently in the midst of a thirty day stay here, about ten days in, and I am very happy with the hotel. I travel to many places and have had bad places before but this is fine, depending on what you need in a hotel. Being it's Amsterdam, I personally do not need a hotel with a good restaurant. Step outside the door and there's so much to choose from. Breakfast is so-so but, again, step outside for a wonderful cafe. Location is great...much around to do. Street noise can be loud at times but it is a main street. I was upgraded to a Deluxe, which is one up from a normal room, and it's very comfy, nice bathroom. Though they have those showers with no curtains, only a two foot partition so your floor will get flooded (what's with these Europeans and this set up!!)ALSO...PLEASE NOTE.....they charge 22 Euro a day for high speed internet service (yikes!!) BUT if you have in computer WIFI, you can find a free service called HOTSPOT AMSTERDAM if you look in the area of computer that shows that stuff. Whew!!!!

<Content>Great location, quality hotel I disagree with some of the posts here. This is a great hotel. I stayed her for 3 nights and had a great room overlooking the street. The Italian restaurant downstairs is good, but nothing special. The staff was friendly and eager to help. My room was on the 3rd floor and it was at the end of the hall. We had 2 queens and a couch. The bathroom was large, clean and had a heated towel rack. The Jolly is in a great location, situated next to the flower markets. You are within walking distance of the main shopping loop and about a 10 minute hike to the Red light district. This is a 4 star hotel and my stay here was excellent. 5 minutes from the train station via the trolley. Safe area, walking distance to most things.

<Content>Just a normal person giving a review me and my girlfriend are just back from Amsterdam and we stayed at the jolly carlton hotel for 4 nights in a standard double room.we booked with Hotels and paid around 600gbp 4ntsupon arriving at reception of the hotel it looked quite nice with a large seating areas which were clean. we went the desk, gave our names and the staff were pleasant and helpful, then a person came up to us with a trolley and took our luggage and took us to our room but.. **I think this service is reflected in the hotel price/star rating which you pay more for  isnt really something personally id rather not have paid for in the overall price**We arrived in a room on the 4th floor which to be honest was quite plain and bland, the room itself was described online as double or 2 single beds dont let the pics online fool you folks its doesnt look quite like the same, we got 2 single beds the room size, of the bedroom was just abit small **wasnt really really tiny but it was small and not comfortable for the price we paid, you should be able to get bigger rooms in amsterdam for the money you pay for this hotel, this is my 4th time to amsterdam and have always stayed in the rembrandt area, **for example: we stayed in a hotel 20metres across the road from this hotel last year called 'albus grand hotel', it was 3 star and the only differences i can see is that the main repception of the jolly hotel is bigger, someone carrys your luggage, there is 2 more lifts and a resturant you get a full size bath but the 3star across the road their rooms where alot nicer and less expensive and about the same size,the bathroon was small no doubt about it, if you can imagine or look at some pics, if you where standing at the bathroom door looking into the bathroom you would see the full size bath against the wall opposite the door, between the door this bath wall is about 3meters max, its about 3x3meters the bathroom is.the view was looking into offices about 15metres from our windows and unfortunley there were a few large fans on the roof, initally i thought the noise was general street noise but these where industrial fans so this again it was quite an expensive hotel room to have to listen to very loud fans at the best of times when the windows open. there is a mini bar in the hotel room and when i got there i checked it out, there was a small tin of orange juice which i drank, tin of coke,  a packet or caramelised nuts, it came to 17euro, which when which i looked at the price list all the soft drinks where 5euro no less, so the mini bar is way to expensive and they have no vending machines for drinks or food to force you to use it, i would aviod using this at all costs.overall this hotel is definitley not a 4 star hotel that is worth 600gbp for 4nights, there are nicer 3 star hotels we have stayed in the area, you are paying alot of money for a standard double room, which is just small size, small bathroom and possible or more than likley not really an enjoyable room for 4nts, very plain not even comtempoary so it wasnt really worth the money we could of saved on other hotels

<Content>Good location Just come back from staying at 'The Jolly Carlton' Hotel, Amsterdam.This hotel is very central, within walking distance of Dam Square, The Palace and about 15-20 mins walk from Centraal Station.The breakfast in the hotel is fair but not worth the 19 euro per person.We had a Deluxe room which was large, good view over canal and over the flower market this was on the fifth floor and was very nice. Ann Franks House was very much worth a visit.If you get chance to go to Voldendam and Marken on an excursion then go, this was a good trip.People seem very friendly although beware if you are looking lost someone may wish to help you which is good, but for a fee!

<Content>Dutch Disaster I cannot think of any good things about my recent experience at the Jolly Hotel Carlton in Amsterdam. Ok, maybe one thing 鈥?it鈥檚 in a good location, but that鈥檚 it. In addition to the well worn 80鈥檚 d茅cor and dimly lit hallways, they stuffed up our room booking which meant we had to move. The breakfast we ordered was not only late but it was cold and without tea or coffee which took them 2 further trips to rectify which they then had the cheek to charge us 鈧?2 for (The caf茅s along the flower market a nicer and offer better value!). The bathrooms were not adequately clean and ours had the aroma of a men鈥檚 urinal. There was an orange fluorescent street light outside our window which we could not block out because the curtains were mere window dressing and could not be drawn which, added to the fact that there is a club behind the hotel, meant the street noise was horrendous. We even endured a 4am game of street football bouncing off the building 5 storeys below. Finally to add insult to injury, the total cost. It鈥檚 not often that I leave a hotel feeling ripped off but I did here. I know it鈥檚 not easy finding the balance between value for money and a decent hotel in Amsterdam and if, like us, that鈥檚 what you鈥檙e looking for 鈥?keep looking.

<Content>Very nice stay! My husband and I really like the Jolly Carlton in Amsterdam. We had a large bathroom, comfy bed, and fantastic view. We could sit in our window and look out over the town. Location was excellent, too. We walked everywhere, and breakfast at the hotel was always really good. I normally do not like chain hotels, but this one is the exception - I totally recommend it for everyone!

<Content>Dear Oh Dear It's hard to find anything very good to say about the Jolly Carlton Hotel. Okay, it's safe and in a good location. That's all. The rest of it was terrible. As well as the drab 80鈥檚 d茅cor and the dim and dreary hallways, they gave us a twin when we specifically asked for a double. Our breakfast was delivered late, cold and minus the coffee which took two trips to rectify and then had the cheek to charge us 32 euros for! (the cafes by the flower market are much nicer and better value). The huge fluorescent orange street light that shone into our room could not be avoided as the curtains were only window dressing and could not be shut! The street noise was horrendous (there is a club behind the hotel) and had to endure a 4am game of street football echoing 5 storeys below. The room was dubiously 鈥榗lean鈥?with the faint aroma of a men鈥檚 urinal in the bathroom (when we arrived) and the tea and coffee making facilities consisted of 2 packets of herbal tea, some coffee and powdered milk with plastic cups and spoons. The spoons melted in the hot tea and I felt as I was yet to be trusted with a 鈥榬eal鈥?cup and saucer! And to top it all was the bill at the end of our stay. Way too expensive for what we got. I don鈥檛 often leave a hotel feel ripped off but I did here. I know it鈥檚 difficult to find good value for money with accommodation in Amsterdam but I highly recommend that you keep looking. Jolly it鈥檚 definitely not.

<Content>Wonderful location The hotel staff were helpful, location excellent, rooms clean and our stay was great. We would recommend this hotel to those who want to see all of Amsterdam but still sleep comfortably at night. From the airport just hop on the train to central station (3.40 euro) then take tram 14 or 16 (1.60euro) to the tower. Right past the tower is this great hotel. Would definetly recommend getting a canal bus pass for the day (16.00euro). They're good until noon the following day and make stops close to all the major museums and historical sites (Van gogh museum, Anne Frank House,etc). What a delightful city!

<Content>Average Hotel, above average prices! We have just returned from a 3 day break in Amsterdam which we thoroughly enjoyed. It's a great city with loads to see and do. I would definitely recommend it. However, we did find the hotel very expensive. We got upgraded to a superior room on arrival (for free) but if this was superior I dread to think what the standard room was like. It was a good size with a view of the canal and pretty clean, which is the main thing, but the price was way too high for this room. If you can find a really cheap rate then fine, but if not, look for another hotel. We paid 280 euro for 2 nights. The hotel was recommended by a friend and for this price I expected it to be of a good standard, but I wished we had shopped around more.

<Content>Just what we wanted I booked this Hotel after looking at so many reviews on tripadviser - which I must say were really helpful. Got a good deal by booking late and upon arrival were offered an upgrade to a superior room - 433. This was larger than some of the rooms and was directly facing the flowermarket and Muntplein so we always had the time handy! The room was very pleasant and comfortable with a safe, minibar etc - only minor fault really was the double bed was 2 singles. The Hotel was clean, comfortable and the staff helpful. The location of the hotel - (one of the reasons I chose it) was fantastic - close to everything. We had a short break but everything was so easy to get to that we were able to fit in everything we wanted to do. Few things to do on your trip - Anne Frank House well worth a visit, go up the tower of the Westkerk to get a fabulous view of Amsterdam, of course a canal cruise, don't miss the Begijnhof a secret village in the middle of town hidden off the Spui. The Leidsplein area is a great way to spend the evening with so many choices of what and where to eat or to just watch the world go by or the street artists perform. Our few days were packed with great sights, wonderful food (try the Indonesian experience of rijsttafel a selection of dishes with rice) at the Kantijil  de Tijger on Spuistraat, pancakes at Pancake Corner and tea on the top floor of Metz  Co down the road from the Jolly where you can see the whole of the city. I could go on as there were so many good things to see and do. Book the Jolly and you won't be disappointed - but try and get a good deal. One thing to watch for - we booked the Airport Connexion bus to take us back to the airport for 11 euros each however it didn't turn up (booked for 1.45pm), we had to get a taxi at the last minute and pay taxi fare the one thing we tried to avoid. I felt the Hotel could have done something to address this as they knew we were waiting. We were lucky a taxi was pulled up outside so we jumped in. To avoid this book a bus earlier than you need just in case or go by train as we did on the way in.

<Content>Very nice hotel Had a one night stay at the Jolly Carlton Hotel. It's a 15 minute walk from Central Station but very near the floating flower market and Anne Frank museum. After checking in we were shown to our room by the eager porter only to find someone already there! We went back to reception and nothing was too much trouble. We were upgraded to a very nice room with a seating area and large bathroom and drowned in apologies. The room was on the front of the hotel with some road noise at night but not excessive. Beware, hotels in Amsterdam charge City Tax for each night you stay, its about 5 Euros a night, don't be caught out! I didn't eat at the hotel but my stay was very pleasant and I would recommend the Jolly Carlton, I paid 拢63 for the night which I thought was reasonable.

<Content>A good hotel, but not exceptional The reviews for this hotel seem to be a bit mixed, but after spending two nights there recently, I thought it was a generally good hotel. Although the room I had was rather small, it was clean and comfortable. The airconditioning in the room was great too, especially because Amsterdam seems to get very humid during summer. However, I did find the hotel somewhat on the expensive side. The breakfast seemed over-priced and phone calls were especially expensive. One other drawback was that the cleaners started cleaning rooms quite early in the morning. I was woken up each morning at around 8.00 or 8.30 by the sounds of vacuum cleaners, trolleys, and voices outside my door. This probably wouldn't bother those who like to get up early and head out to explore the city, but if you've had a late night and want to catch up on sleep, then you might want to keep this in mind. Overall though, a good hotel and a good location.

<Content>Solid choice if a tad expensive A work colleague and I were attending a conference at the RAI Centre on the outskirts of Amsterdam. We would have preferred a hotel near the RAI but all of these were booked up, too expensive or had bad reviews on this site. Therefore we settled on the Jolly Carlton as it was just off Rembrantdplein and on the route of the number 4 tram, which goes directly to the RAI. The hotel is a few tram stops down from Central Station with the RAI Centre about 20 minutes further down the line.I booked one standard double room each for myself and my colleague on Expedia. I arrived on a Sunday and did not get an upgrade to a superior room whereas my colleague arrived on a Tuesday and, without prompting, did get an upgrade. We both checked out on Friday morning so perhaps his shorter stay meant he was more likely to get the lucky break.I cannot speak for my colleague's room but my standard double room (215) was suitable for its purposes. The size of the room was adequate for one person but it may feel a bit cramped for two. There was plenty of cupboard and hanging space, the desk was a good size and the separate table and chairs were most useful. The desk was too close to the bed for comfort and there was a general lack of power points but I got by by shuffling recharging devices. Free coffee/tea making facilities were included.The bed was very comfortable for a hotel bed and it had decent pillows. The window arrangement was slightly odd, semi-circular in shape with an assortment of drapes to pull across and no view to speak of. However there was no significant light spill or noise creep from the fairly busy main road outside and this was a big plus for me. In fact, I didn't realise I had the AC turned on for the first two days, which was helping to mask the outside noise.The bathroom was very clean and well stocked, with an excellent lighted shaving mirror. The shower, over a medium size bath, was very cramped; anyone over 6 foot would have to stand sideways to avoid bumping their shoulder into a protruding wooden cover along the length of the cieling above the bath, which was hiding a large pipe I presumed. The shower itself was slightly tricky to get the temperature right - and keep it there - but I've had much worse and the pressure was good.The mini-bar was reasonably stocked, with a small can of Heineken costing 5 euros. I used the laundry service at 10 euros for a pair of jeans and these were competently cleaned. The wireless internet did not work very well, maybe because the antenna on my room's device was broken. The 100Mb LAN connection from the same device did work well, even if it was more than 20 euros for one day's access (max 24 hours, to 14:00). The television worked properly with BBC World, Sky News and CNN for the English speaker and a better choice of German, Dutch, French and Italian channels for others.The description of the hotel on Expedia claimed that all rooms have a mini-safe. This is not the case! Also, there was nothing even vaguely suitable that I could find to securely attach a kensington lock to. Even though the staff at reception were more than happy to put my laptop in the back room when I wanted to leave it at the hotel, I would have preferred to secure it in my room.The hotel recpetion staff and porters were all very friendly and spoke excellent English (and Italian I think). I chose not to eat at the hotel since I did not have time for a full breakfast and most other meals were provided at the conference. The menu looked expensive but of a high standard.Overall, I would say this is a good three star hotel but not a four star hotel. If you are going as a couple, or are over 6 feet tall, I would strongly recommend getting one of the Superior rooms but for a single person or a small couple, the standard rooms are sufficient. I will give it 4/5 however if I had had to pay for the room myself, I would have given 3/5.

<Content>great experience lots of bad reviews on the web, however we had a great time. rooms were fine and we stayed economy! not the best view but a good view with an interesting view of the city (by the way if you are in Amsterdam and you spend more than 8 hours in the hotel you should go home!). Very clean, professional and generally (owing to the time of travel) not too expensive. Amsterdam is likely the best people watching city, with the Dutch some of the nicest and most friendly people we have met. I would go back in a heart beat. the tour books correctly state that while Amsterdam is a small city it is very compact and full of attractions. the Tulip market is at the door of the Jolly and is wonderful and not to be missed. When I arrived (about 5 hours after my wife) she had adorned the room with two dozen white roses and 100 red tulips!!! And all for about 20 euros. After long meetings it was the most welcome site I have seen. The beer is cold, the staff professional, and the Italian resturant (in the hotel) has some of the best service and food we have experienced (and owing to the calibre affordable). Kids listen to me with the cost of direct flights (inexpensvie) and the efficiency of the airport (the best I have seen and I have been in many), the Dutch hospitality (very friendly to Canadians) and very efficient transportation, go to Amsterdam and forget LA, Vancouver or Toronto!Just for a simple example I spent $47 CAD to go to the airport (from Mississauga) and spend 3.70 EUR from Central Station (Amsterdam) to the airport.Great city, good hotel and if you want to do it economy it can be really affordable. go and do it soon.

<Content>Nice hotel and city We stayed at the Jolly Carlton Hotel which was just near the floating flower market. The hotel was 4* but would probably rate it 3* in England but clean, comfortable and tidy with friendly staff. The city is very clean and pleasant to walk around. The transport system is the best trams, bikes and canal buses being very popular to travel on. We walked most places though but did by a canal bus ticket which was fairly expensive but worth it as we spent nearly a full day just going up and down the different canals as they offer a different perspective on the city and you can take it on at your own pace rather than getting caught up in the pace of other tourists. The city has become extremely commercialised. The squares are much like Spain, in respect of the bars, like Irish bars etc. Not at all like Paris where they have not embraced the tourist but expected the tourist to embrace their city, which I personally preferred.The Red Light District is not at all what you would expect. Unless you go down the smaller side streets then perhaps this is where it all happens but as I was with my partner we did not do this we just stuck to the main streets where tourists were walking even with younger children in some groups so that shows how tame it actually is for some.There is a lot of pick pocketing signs so be careful with your money. Even though we were not a victim of this crime I can imagine it is quite common as at the busy markets there are a lot of people just pushing past you. Money - The exchange rate is ok for the UK and exchanging your 拢 to Euros in the UK is great too and free, but in Amsterdam the commission was around 8% which is 1% too much for me so we just drew money from the cash points I would suggest you do the same if your bank offers you this service for free like ours as it is rare for shops, bars etc to credit cards be it Visa or MasterCard etc, they like their cash only system it would seem.Also beware of early flights as check in times for hotels are 2pm like most but flights to Amsterdam tend to be early morning arrivals for connections.I would definitely recommend you visit Amsterdam as it is a nice place.

<Content>We loved it!! Stayed at this hotel in Jan 2005. After waiting in reception for over an hour for our room to be ready - the only disappointing thing about this experience - we were ushered to the most georgeous room, with massive bathroom, study desk and huge king bed. And because of the wait they offered us free breakfast the following morning!! The hotel is lovely, clean and airy, and so were the rooms. There was no view, but that doesn't really bother us. Would stay here again in a second if given the chance. The breakfast was delightful, hot bacon, eggs, croissants, toasts, cereals etc etc etc.

<Content>safe bet Finding a hotel for a group of six friends was a bit stresslful as none of us had been to Amsterdam before.Jolly Hotel Carlton was a very centrally located. Right near the flower market we were able to walk to the Leidslpien, Dam Square, Red Light District and any other sights we vistited. Trams are right out in front of the hotel but our group of New Yorkers are used to walking and had no problems getting where we needed to go by foot.The hotel was pricey at $190 a night for a double room but recommended if this price fits your budget- the rooms were nice, bathrooms were a bit small but fine and the concierge was helpful with all of our questions. It wasn't the most luxiurious hotel in Amsterdam but for the price I felt it was worth it.We only opted to pay for the 12 Euro breakfast on our last day - you can get a better meal at any cafe around with a better atmosphere.

<Content>Great Hotel and Location! My wife and I stayed three nights in this hotel in March. We were very satisfied: - Great Location: just next to the flower market, 5 minute walk to Dam Square. A tram station is about a block away.- Great room: good size and decoration.- Service: Very friendly staff.- Good value: We payed close to 100 Euro and we feel it was worth it.

<Content>Very Jolly indeed Scored a last minute deal on this hotel - 80 euro for a regular room. Requested upgrade on arrival and although initial quote was 50 euro, the clerk then advised that it would be only 25 euro.Was given a large room on the top floor of the hotel. Very large balcony with lovely view of local area.Great location - in walking distance to just about everything and tram outside the door. Great facilities - large bathroom, comfortable bed, cable and good size room. Breakfast was only 12 euro for all-you-can-eat (hot food included). Staff were friendly and helpful at all times.Excellent value for the price and was very happy with the hotel. Would recommend upgrade, though. Regardless, would definitely stay again.

<Content>Upgrade to Suite The ordinary rooms are small by American standards but OK for a night or two. My wife and I spent an extra 50 Euros per day for an upgrade to a very large suite with a fantastic view because we were there for six nights in March, 2005. Our bumpout windows on the 5th floor overlooked the Flower Market and Canal, the 400-year-old Mint Tower and a Piccadilly Circus-like convergence of several busy streets and tram lines. Buffet breakfast was very good and staff helpful. Within 100 yards of McDonald's, many eat-in/takeout food places and wide range of shops. Less than a mile to nearly all major museums and other attractions. But beware the sauce-free, tasteless, Italian pizzas.

<Content>Clean  I've just got back from the Dam. This is now the 5th hotel that I have stayed (as I have been nine times before). I was not expecting much, and was left feeling neither disappointed nor impressed. It certainly isn鈥檛 the Carlton! Don鈥檛 go because it has a 4* rating (or you will be disappointed). Stay if you can get a cheap rate, if I had paid the rack rate I would have been really annoyed. Room was very clean but a bit too noisy (and I was on a higher floor). There was nothing wrong, as I had left it too the last minute this was the best deal that I could get, and it was a good deal.

<Content>Location, Location The very best thing about the Jolly Carlton is the location - it is central to pretty much everything with excellent restaraunts (we'd recommend the Tujuh Market for lovely Indonesian food and d'Vijff Vlieghen for an atmospheric location with exceptional cooking) very close by and all the major sights an easy walk away.The hotel is clean, staff friendly (we had no problems to raise and found the staff - particualrly the two doormen- very polite and helpful), and the breakfast buffet was good though the the cafe bar is expensive and there are much nicer bars and cafes within five minutes walk. The room decor is a bit dated but was in good repair and the room was spacious. Ask for a room higher up and on the canal side for lovely views...

<Content>Great Location But Ask for a Superior Room Got to the Jolly Hotel late Thursday night and was very disappointed with the Standard Double Room we were given, which was on the small side and the bed was not a full-sized double. However, we decided to pay to upgrade to a superior room at an extra cost of 25 Euros per night, which was well worth it. The room was large and the width of the bathroom probably the same size as the original standard room we had been given!! The location of the hotel is fantastic - you can walk to most places which is great. Would definitely stay there again, but would ensure that we booked a superior room to start with!!

<Content>Satisfied with the Jolly experience! Just like some previous reviewers who have read prior negative reviews, I thought briefly about cancelling our reservations- but it was too late and cancelling would have been costly so I decided to make a go of it. If anyone else who is reading this is in the same position- I can assure you, no worries, the experience was just fine. I did email ahead of time after reading the reviews to confirm a nonsmoking room preferably on the top floor with a balcony and view. I received an email msg within the next 12 hrs stating that they had put my request through but could not guarantee anything. Upon arrival at 2pm, our room was ready, and sure enough, they had given us a wonderful room on the 6th floor with a breathtaking view of the clock tower and the rest of Amsterdam below. Granted, we had asked for a queen bed and we got 2 twin beds, but fortunately we are not overweight so it was not a huge deal. The room was of avg size, the bathroom was avg- a towel warmer in place but not working. The service was very courteous and helpful- not at all rude as reported in prior reviews. The doormen showed us personally where to park the car and helped us store our luggage after we checked out to pick up later in the day. Parking is in a very secure garage (in fact, we were not given keys to it- only the doorman could let us in) and is 35 Euros a day. The location is Jolly's biggest asset- on the same street as the floating flower market- so very convenient to everything- we walked everywhere with ease.... you can't beat this hotel when it comes to it's location and reasonable price.I agree to some extent with prior reviews, the Jolly is not a 4 star hotel by American standards (more like a 3 star), but probably by Amsterdam standards it is a 4 star, and certainly was a pleasurable experience. It's hard for me to quote a reasonable price- we paid 149 Euros/nt for our room... I probably would recommend not paying much more than that.Overall, a very satisfying experience!!

<Content>Jolly jolly jolly We stayed in the Jolly last winter and our experience was super. When we checked in early morning our room was'nt ready yet. However the reception staff was extremely friendly and helpfull. We registered and were offered a city map also our luggage was stored by the concierge. After our lunch when we got back to the hotel our room was ready and the luggage brought up. Though the room was small it was nice, clean and comfortable. Despite of the very negative comments we've read at this site, we actually had a wonderfull stay in the Jolly carlton hotel and surely will stay there again when visiting Amsterdam again.

<Content>Jolly much better than Victoria Booked this Hotel through Expedia, then read these reviews and panicked slightly. Stayed at the Victoria in July, and this was way better. We arrived too early to check in to our room, but the receptionist was friendly, gave us a map of Amsterdam, and a guide booklet, and the concierge kept our bags for us. When we returned a few hours later, the same receptionist remembered us.The room wasn't brilliant, but we loved it. It was exceptionally clean, nicely decorated and although not huge, there was plenty of room, and storage.We had no room safe, not the adverstised slippers, but there was an abundance of towels, shampoos etc.Also, there were tea/ coffee making facilities at no extra charge.Queries that we raised were dealt with promptly and with a nice attitude, and breakfast was good. The mini bar prices were not excessive.The room was not soundproofed to the traffic, but this was not noisy enough to be a problem. As a frequent visitor to Amsterdam, this would be on my list for hotels to visit again.

We were promised a Deluxe Room with fine veiws over Amsterdams Flower Market We got an extremley dull room overlooking a busy main road which was very small and hadn't seen paint for years. For the privilage we were charged 拢100 UK pounds! I have stayed in better 2 star hotels! They also tried to charge us 50 EUROS! Yes 50 EUROS! for connecting to a TOLL FREE number on our lap top. A complete rip off.Avoid at all costs!

<Content>Fantastic location, excellent hospitality! Stayed at the Jolly for the weekend, so glad we picked this hotel. Location was fantastic beside the floating Flower Market. Taking the tram was easy, only about 5 mins to Central Station and to Leiseplain. Walking to the Old Side and Chinatown was a pleasant 15 minutes through the main shopping street in the City. Good choice of fast food and decent restaurants in the area. We arrived early but were allowed to check in the room. The hotel upgraded us, at no extra charge, to a lovely superior room on the top floor with a balcony and a nice view of the city. Not spacious but the room was clean, modern and I believe recently renovated in 2003. We would definitely stay again on our next trip.

<Content>Not user-friendly Just responding to a rave review - I found the staff to be pretentious and cold. Generally disinterested. The cafe personnel were even worse. The bellman was also incompetent. The rooms are adequate, except the single I was in (non-opening windows and local Thai cuisine...). The location is great (at the floating bulb vendors, near major art, and the Red Light District), and the prices are reasonable.I won't be back.

<Content>Absolutely horrible I stayed on the 30th August at the Jolly Carlton in a deluxe room (the best one in the hotel) foor which I payed 130鈧?excluding breakfast. The room is actually quoted between 315 and 450 euros. It was not well lightened and it did not have nothing special, but it was ok. The hallways in the hotel were terrible: smelly, with worn carpets and full with the remains of room-service dishes. The lobby was quite little for a 4star luxury hotel there were few armchairs to sit. I arrived at 9.00am but the rooms were made available only at 2pm. The staff was all but helpful, better saying a bit rude and unfriendly. The doormen were very unpolite and they tried to send me to a diamond factory in which they probably had friends, though the hotel suggested another factory. The doormen also have an agreement with the taxi driver for guests who have to go to the airport so they will make you pay more. Be careful!!I'm an italian and I've always been staying at Jolly Hotels but this is the worst I've seen!! The worst possible example of Italian hospitality in the world; I'm ashamed.

<Content>Jolly Hotel - avoid this place!!! I recently had the misfortune of staying at this hotel. At 4-star prices, I received 1-star service from a management staff I can only describe as cold, rude and uncarring of client requests/concerns. A miscommunication over the hotel's online booking system left me with a much larger bill than expected and when I made repeated requests (via e-mail after leaving Holland)for clarification, all of my requests went unanswered. Moreover, I paid for expensive breakfasts I didn't eat and wasn't aware I was being charged for (If you do stay here be very vigilant about your billing!!). When I inquired about getting a rebate for meals that I didn't eat, my inquiry went unanswered. Any other 4-star hotel I've stayed at would have at very least offered responses to my concerns. Even a simple sorry, sir, there's little we can do... would have sufficed. Amsterdam has numerous 3/4-star hotel choices that far surpass the Jolly in price and service, so I highly urge readers of this to look elsewhere for a room. And a suggestion to the hotel management: you and your staff are in dire need of public relations skills training. You have much to learn about the hotel business. I hope your head office is reading this.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at the Jolly Carlton in August for 3 nights. We took advantage of a stay three nights only pay for two offer. The location of the hotel is fantastic; it is within easy walking distance from practically anywhere. As a bonus it is easily accessible from Central Station (about a 15 minute walk), which saves a fortune in taxi fares to, and from the airport. The room we got was large and with all the amenities you could possibly need - even the minibar prices were reasonable. The staff were polite and helpful and the breakfast was plentiful. Overall a great hotel although in my opinion slightly over priced. That said though, I'd definitely go back there.

<Content>We have been treated better in a 2 star hotel. Four of us were in Amsterdam for a weekend break. We were supposed to arrive on the Fri night, but due to Air Traffic probs, we were 3 hours late, arriving at the hotel at 12.30am. We had pre-booked 3 months ago and paid in full for 2 rooms, only to be told on our arrival that the rooms had been given to someone else.We were told this was tough luck  at no time was an apology given.We were put in a taxi to another hotel at the other end of town, which the taxi driver could not find (you would think the Jolly would have given him directions)  finally got to our rooms at 3.00am.The next day, we commenced our siteseeing feeling extremely tired. Upon our return to the alternative hotel for lunch, we were locked out of our rooms and told this was because the Jolly hotel had only paid for one night  had just called to ask that we be sent back to the Jolly Hotel. We then had to pack again, and suffer another taxi ride across Amsterdam, effectively losing most of the afternoon. On arrival at the Jolly, we were given a room upgrade, which was fine, but did not make up for the fact we had lost at least half a day of a one and a half day trip (result of not getting up early because of late check-in  being sent back to Jolly). The excuse used by the hotel was they had problems with their system. This is hard to believe as surely a hotel should only accept payment/ money for the number of rooms in their hotel and no more? We were travelling with my mum  her sister, who were both on their first trip abroad at the age of 70 - I fear that as a result of the problems, this will have been their first and last trip. Added to the above probs, the bar staff were rude and arrogant and the service poor. I put our drinks on the room tab and when I had to sign for it, I could not understand what to write and where as it was all in Dutch. The bar man proceeded to ridicule me in front of other customers. He could obviously speak good English, so all he need to say was 'please print you name here'. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and have had better holidays staying in Youth Hostels.

<Content>Jolly Jolly Joy Joy... Just came back from a 5 night stay at the Jolly Carlon Hotel. Excellent hotel in a great location. Room was perfect, nicely decorated, very comfy bed and huge bathtub - especially nice after spending the day walking all over town. Location is excellent, literally 10 minutes to everything. Trams stop right around the corner from the hotel and run everywhere. I only took the tram once but that's because I enjoy walking. The stroll up the main shopping street around the corner from the hotel to Dam square is so intoxicating, full of life and culture. After reading some other reviews I was somewhat skeptical, but ended up being pleasantly surprised with everything! I stayed at the Victoria last time I vistited which does not even come close in comparison to the Jolly. I would definitely stay here again and reccommend it highly.

<Content>Above expectations Mixed reader reviews led me to have grave concerns about my stay. However, I was very pleasantly suprised. We arrived early and were made most welcome. We were able to deposit our luggage early and returned to be accomodated in a lovely spacious room with every possible facility. Excellent bathroom, good decor and comfy beds. The breakfast was satisfying and plentiful. All the staff were very helpful, courtious and always available to help. The location was terrific next to the floating flower gardens and you were no more than 10-15 mins walk in any direction to museums, city square or canal trips. A delightful hotel which we will gladly return to.

<Content>overpriced, average but not outstanding for what was expected after reading the reviews in tour books I expected more from this 4 star hotel. It was average in size. the staff were average in their ability to help. the location was average. for the same price the Krasnopolsky was a better location. the breakfast was excellent and the restaurant staff were great. the room was clean but there was cheap construction of wood that was like a guitar for the nyophitos only. in conclusion it was your big ,generic , average hotel.

<Content>A 2-Star Motel This hotel has the most obnoxious and un-professional manager that I have ever seen. Arrived early but rooms were not ready till noon. Every other sentence from the manager was If you don't like it, you can go to another hotel Last time I heard this kind of thing was when I was back packing in Europe staying at youth hostels. Got stuck in a broken elevator for 20+ minutes. Manager's response: you were in the wrong elevator Later he said this kind of things happens ...it is not our fault.. Rooms were small and the interiors not well maintained. We paid through Priceline. Might be worth it if you can pay $50. The rest of the staff was generally good and sympathetic, though.

<Content>A hotel to return to. Stayed at Jolly Hotel from 3rd April until 8th April 2004. The staff and the hotel were excellent nothing was to much trouble. We were given a room upgrade on arrival at no extra cost. The restaurant Caruso is superb and the staff first class and the food out of this world for taste and selection,well worth a number of visits to try the different meals on offer. My wife and I will return again later in 2004. This was our first visit to Amsterdam a combination of staying at the Jolly hotel and a beautiful city and friendly people will ensure that we return in the near future.

<Content>"Great Staff and Location" We stayed 2 nights at the Jolly Carlton a week ago and paid around 110Eur per night (don't pay more than this). The room was okay, the deco was a little too 80s style rather than 4*. We were on the 6th floor with a nice view of the city. The best part of the hotel was its quality service. The staff was very helpful in calling museums for me after I had lost my camera in one. They were always around and very very helpful. The location is also very good, its right by the flower market with tons of beautiful flowers everywhere, very lovely!! Overall, I'd recommand this hotel.

<Content>fantastic! We had a lovely stay at this hotel between 15 - 18 February this year. On arrival we mentioned we booked thru expedia and were allocated a deluxe room. I was dreading the stay after reading some not very nice reports, but the room was fantastic as was the service. We were amazed at the size of the room and the cleanliness, we loved the bed-time choccies and the bathroom I wanted to take home! We had a few problems with the automatic sensors on the minibar as we chilled our own bought milk and beer but this was rectified happily. We found the staff to very courteous and helpful. The only downside was the price of the menus. Good tip - Mcdonalds across the road seres hot criossants and cappuccino! Loads of lovely restaurants for all tastes and budgets on the doorstep! Would definately return to this hotel.

<Content>Not that Jolly... We booked 3 nights in a deluxe room with breakfast for ?95 per night...the room itself was lovely, fab bathroom but if, like me, you are booking this hotel for the whirlpool bath, you'll be disappointed! The baths have not worked for the past 3 yrs although some websites still state that they are in every room. Also the staff were pretty rude to us, we asked for room service at 10.30pm on a sunday night and were laughed at. Not really a 4* I'd say, but you can't beat the location.

<Content>Better than I expected. We stayed here for 3 nights in Feb 2004 and paid about ?100/night inc breakfast and all taxes. I'm normally quite critical of hotels but for that money we did well here. Fab location by the flower market/ Rembrandtplein. We were allocated a room on the top floor (7th) and found we had one of the few roof balconies! Room was fine - lots of toiletries, good bed, had a safe, was clean and quiet. All the staff were multilingual and helpful enough without being overbearing. We didnt eat here apart from breakfast which was typical 4* but the restaurant menu didn't appear to be anything special and was pricey.

<Content>Great location We spent 3 nights here from 20th Feb 2004 till 23rd Feb 2004. Fantastic location.... no need for a tram as you can walk absolutely everywhere.The room itself was clean but on the small side.after reading the tariff prices on the back of the room door we were exceedingly glad that we purchased our rooms off expedia.The hotel itself charges 240 Euros a night MINIMUM...... its not worth that much.For some reason the room got exceedingly hot at night.The staff where helpful. But as i have already said the best thing about this hotel is its location.

<Content>An absolutely jolly stay! We stayed at the Jolly Hotel Carlton on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2004. Got the 'Winter Rate' of 65 euros (including tax) for a twin room. The room was great, probably the cleanest hotel room I've ever seen. The room was as large as most US hotels and appeared to have been recently renovated. The bathroom was fabulous with heated, fluffy towels! The hotel was immaculate and the staff was very kind. I would say it was definitely a 4 star hotel by American standards.We stayed in a 3 star hotel in Brussels (Arlequin Hotel) for 68 euros a night that was tiny but clean and included breakfast.We will surely return to this hotel on our next trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Fantastic location The Jolly Carlton was an excellent base for our 4 night stay. We had a 6th floor non-smoking room with balcony overlooking Vijzelstraat. The room was on the small side, but was comfortable, clean and well serviced each day. There is adequate storage and hanging space, the bathroom with shower was spotlessly clean, lovely towels and an array of toiletries provided. There is a coffee/tea tray provided and of course the mini bar, which despite not opening were presented with a bill for this when checking out, (this was very courteously rectified). The buffet breakfast was superb, especially the fresh fruit tray. The entrance to the hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from a tram stop (4 routes) the same distance from one of the main shopping areas, and across the road from a street with an internet cafe and the Tuchinski theatre (cinema). Despite having purchased a strippenkart, we found that we walked to most places such was the central location of this hotel.

<Content>A+ for position My husband and I had stayed at the Jolly Carlton previously and although the room was quite small, we had no hesitation putting my father and his companion there, when we booked them a trip to Amsterdam as a Christmas present. The major plus for this hotel is it's position. It's right in the heart of things and central for all attractions, right next to the flower market and on the main tram routes. I e-mailed the hotel ahead and explained the stay was a gift and they were wonderful to my dad (in his mid-seventies) and gave them a huge room with luxury bathroom. They could not have asked for more!Dad says the buffet breakfast was first class and not unreasonable at 10 Euros a head (free on the last morning for some reason too!). Front desk and concierge were friendly and helpful, especially sorting out transportation to the airport for the return journey.Our last trip to Amsterdam we stayed nearer the station but would return to the Jolly Carlton for it's position alone.

<Content>Jolly Hotel is definitely Jolly! Having read all the terrible reviews of this hotel AFTER i had booked a surprise break for my partner and me i was starting to panic and was seriously considering trying to cancel and book somewhere else! However, i decided to stick with what i had chosen thanks to the one very positive email that was posted. I have to say, i am a very picky person and i was delighted with the hotel. The hotel itself was immaculate from the moment you walk in the door all the way to the room. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was a good size and had a king size bed, plenty of wardrobe space and a large bathroom. The room decor was fine and the carpets were clean (contrary to popular belief)! There was an abundance of towels and toiletries and the whole room looked and smelled clean. We were on the 6th floor, which was excellent as the lifts work perfectly and we had a balcony which had fantastic views. The only thing i would say is a potential negative is that the food and drink is rather pricey! However, in such a fantastic location as this hotel is it really doesn't matter as you can step out of the hotel and choose from dozens of places to eat, drink, whatever! Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Depends how much you're paying for it... Put it this way, if you can get a really cheap deal (we paid 95euros per night, twin room) then this hotel is fantastic. If you are paying full price then you're being ripped off. The location is great, the rooms are clean and comfortable but the service leaves a bit to be desired and the staff have a really bad attitude (especially if you're not paying full prices!). I would recommend it though only at a good price...

<Content>I love and hate it. I've stayed here several times. Good and bad. But I will stay here again. Very worn out furnishings, unfriendly, unhelpful front desk staff. Many rooms very small with stained carpets. My bed this last trip had springs poking out of the mattress, disgusting. Two terrible restaurants with very bad staff who don't speak English or know anything about restaurant service. On the good side, fantastic central location. Some of the rooms are large and have fantastic views. Nice marble bathrooms. If you get the right room at the right price with the right view you might be very happy and willing to overlook the negatives. I'll go back but am always ready to pack up and move to another hotel if needed.
