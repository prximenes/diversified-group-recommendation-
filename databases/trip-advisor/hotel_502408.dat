<Content>Great Location We just spent 3 nights at the Affinia 50. We are a family of 5 with 3 boys ages 13,11, and 8. Our room had two queen beds in a big bedroom, a spacious living/dining area, and a tiny kitchen. We arrived in a big rush, running late and trying to get to Spamalot on time. Luckily we were helped quickly and graciously and were able to check in, valet park the car, and leave the luggage in the lobby without even going to our room so we could run to the show! Unfortunately when we returned after 11 we found our sleeper sofa was un-made and there were no sheets in the room. We had requested on-line that it be made up in advance. We phoned them at 11:20 and didn't receive the sheets until midnight. That was pretty disappointing as we had tired kids by that time, but certainly forgivable. Our only other problem was that the shampo and conditioner was not replaced on the 2nd day, luckily we had brought some along, so no big problem.Other than those minor problems the room was great, the staff was kind and helpful and the location was really convenient. We had a great stay.

<Content>Affinia 50 - Great Hotel My friend and I stayed for 4 nights at the Affinia 50 hotel recently and really enjoyed our stay there. We were in a studio suite which was a large room with 2 queen beds and it's own kitchen area. The fridge was very useful for keeping drinks in and being able to make a cup of tea in the morning was great.The staff were very helpful at the hotel, the concierge helped us book a Sex and The City tour and remembered us the following day telling us to enjoy the tour which was a nice touch. The front desk and bell staff were always friendly and helpful as well.The hotel is in a great location and walking to the Rockefeller Center, Times Square and 5th Avenue was really easy. Don't forget to try the wine and cheese on the 2nd floor between 6 and 7 Mon-Thurs, we were only able to enjoy this once but it was very nice.We would highly recommend the New York Luncheonette for breakfast which is just a few doors up the street from the hotel and served great food for a reasonable price. The continental breakfast at the hotel in comparison was $15 which we didn't bother to try.

<Content>Great Location and Spacious Rooms We just returned from spending 5 nights at this great hotel. The location was very convenient to restaurants and subway. Staff was helpful and friendly and the second floor lounge was a great place to meet friends and have a complementary glass of wine during the week. Breakfast (continental) in the lounge was OK but pricey. (There is a great bagel place a half block away.) The rooms are very spacious for NYC at this price. It is also an easy walk from Grand Central Station where the airport shuttles arrive and depart.

<Content>Great Hotel! I have stayed in Manhattan a few times and I definately think the Affinia 50 is the best hotel for quality and value for money so far. We had booked a suite as four of us were sharing a room, worth the bit extra for the extra space. Rooms were large and comfortable with a seperate lounge and kitchen area. Rooms were cleaned everyday and fresh towels left. Location wise the hotel was perfect for sightseeing and shopping, within walking distance for a lot of attractions eg Grand Central Station and the Rockefeller Centre. Good Diner a couple of doors up for breakfast , excellent bagel store accross 3rd  try the nearby Ashton Bar for great pub food. The hotel offers a continental breakfast for $15 dollars but not worth it - try elsewhere. Affinia 50 is just down the street from Waldorf Astoria where theres a stop for the hop on hop off bus tour - really handy for seeing as much as possible in a short time. about $50 for 48 hours.

<Content>superb rooms We have been to NYC twice before this trip and decided to pay a little extra for the room on this trip. It was well worth it. The jump from an NYC 3* to a 3.5* was huge, we actually had a good sized room with a massive bed in it. The staff were very helpful and even arranged our super shuttle back to the airport for us.It is in an excellent location, great diner for breakfast, 30 seconds from the hotel and the subway is half a block away.Well worth going to and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again

<Content>Great Hotel Ideal location, just off Lexington around the corner from The Waldorf. There was six of us shared one junior suite, this had 2 queen beds and a sofa bed. All were really comfortable. There is a choice of pillows!! For example you could have magnetic therapy, buckwheat or Swedish memory! Having a kitchen was really handy. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly at all times.The club room on floor 2 serves complementary wine and cheese on weekday nights however we missed this. They do however serve complementary tea, coffee and fresh orange on a morning. The hotel also have a small gym if you wished to use it 鈥?however we didn鈥檛!!There is a bagel shop around the corner on 3rd Avenue called Ess-a-Bagel we would highly recommend it. Everybody in our party said that they served the best bagels they had ever had. Well worth a visit.If like us you are planning on walking all day and having a nice glass of wine before bed at night there is a deli around the corner (3rd Avenue) that sells a bottle of wine for $10. Be careful as some delis are charging $35!!The highlights for us were:鈥?Top of the Rock鈥?Bloomingdales鈥?Grease on Broadway鈥?Canal Street (china Town) for all the bargains鈥?Katz Diner (where harry met sally)鈥?Sex and City Tour If (when) we return to NY we will definitely stay at the Affinia 50.Enjoy your trip!!!!

<Content>Obnoxious little hotel First time in my life I was given a room... with no window. Calling Amex, I was told NYC hotels are not supposed to provide you with a view unless previously mentioned. I did not want a view, just a window which is standard even in a jail. After a fuss with management, we got upgraded to a so-called junior suite extremely noisy and most certainly designed by a cheap motel decorator. The service at Affinia is useless and obnoxious. Waste of money (and quite a lot).For the same price and in the same area, stay at the Sofitel, the best value for your dollars.

<Content>They aim to please. Just returned from our 11/16/08 - 11/19/08 stay. At check in we rec'd #710 - a very large room for NY - with one lovely full wall of windows. Great during the day, but Sunday night street noise is outrageous. We had snatches of about 45 mins. of sleep all night due to construction, deliveries, cab horns, and squeeling brakes. Asked the front desk for help the next AM and rec'd upgrade (no cost) to #1410 - corner digs at the back of the building. This is the size of a typical NYC apartment with foyer, full kitchen, dining / living area and separate bedroom. Rooms are clean enough - although worn edges / scuffy baseboards / stained carpets beg for attention. Edge dust build up also in hallways - although again quite typical of NYC hotels.Beyond a bit of a 'down in the heel' feel, overall a good time and their beds are the very BEST we've ever slept in! .

<Content>Worth the money I booked at the Affinia 50 based on the strength of the tripadvisor reviews. My school-age sons and I were not disappointed. We found very friendly service, particularly at the the front desk and from the bellmen. My kids enjoyed being able to choose from the pillow menu and I was pleased to be upgraded at no extra cost to a room with a kitchenette. The New York Luncheonette a few doors away is an excellent breakfast spot with superfast service and good food.

<Content>Fantabulous!!!!! This hotel was just spectacular!! First time in NY did not know what to expect from the quality of their hotels but this one is just something else. Arriving at the hotel we had the door of our taxi open our bags taken in for us all we had to do was walk to the check in desk to be greeted by extremely friendly staff. We were no sooner in our room when our bags arrived and were placed exactly where we wanted them in the room The room...... beautiful!!! We booked a studio suite. Massive size in comparison to other suites we have stayed in. Two very big queen sized beds beautifully dressed, a small kitchenette with everything you would have needed in a hotel room kitchen and a very attractive bathroom with a much needed power shower!!! Plenty of TV channels to chose from. We were not in the room longer than 10 minutes when the reception desk phoned to ensure everything was OK and to see if they could provide us with anything else!!! A really nice touch. The purpose of our trip was sightseeing and shopping and the concierge was most helpful in pointing us in the right direction and giving us very detailed maps. We didn't not plan to spend much time in the hotel as our days were limited but it was an absolute pleasure to return from a hard days shopping to a room with beds redressed, pj's folding a fresh towels and shampoos ready to use. The beds....... so so comfy i was tempted to ask could i take one home!!! Any queries we had about NY were answered by either very friendly and helpful reception staff or the concierge. A member of house keeping phoned to make sure everything was up to standard and provided us with extra towels and shampoos on request. A newspaper delivered to your door.... a nice touch. The hotel is located a block from the subway and very close to all the sights of new york. We would recommend you walk to mid town from the hotel to really appreciate its closeness to everything along with being away from the hustle and bustle of mid town Manhattan.On check out the hotel kept our bags in safe keeping for the day as our flight was later that day and when we required a taxi the concierge was most obliging and flagged down a mini bus taxi (we did a lot of shopping) packed up the car for us and wished us a safe trip home. Overall we had an extremely pleasurable stay and would return to this hotel without question and would highly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Good location Just stayed at this hotel, it's in a great location. We walked most places as one of our party was in a wheelchair. The concierges were very helpful arranging a cab for disabled access. The rooms were large, clean  comfortable, 2 queen beds plenty of room for the 3 of us. Beds were soooooooo comfortable, Only one problem we were without hot water for one morning. I would recommend staying at this hotel, this was my second stay in New York stayed at the New york Helmsley last time, the rooms were on par with this hotel, and were a lot cheaper too!

<Content>Sweet and Sour My boyfriend and I checked into the Affinia for my 23rd birthday. I am from Miami and this was my first time in the big city. The sweet, the hotel is beautiful and at first the staff was very accommodating. We arrived on time for our check in; the staff proceeded to inform that our room wouldn鈥檛 be ready for another two or three hour鈥檚. We were not upset and decided to take a walk around town. The rooms are very spacious (two queen beds), Kitchen and their specialty all the pillows you want, they actually have a pillow menu which I found very unique and comfy, the beds were also very comfortable and the rooms were spotless! This room fits a family of six perfectly as they also provide a couch with bed capabilities. The sour, after October 1st the law does not require establishments to provide air conditioning to their guests; they are only supposed to provide heat. Note the Affinia does not have air conditioning after Oct. 1st 鈥?March 30th! You will not read this warning anywhere but here (feel free to call and verify), you have to keep the windows of the room open. If you suffer from allergies like me, you will find this to be a huge problem; my nose was bloody for the entire duration of my visit, and although the beds were comfy I had a tough time breathing making for an unpleasant sleep. Other hotels like the Fitzpatrick, which I also stayed in (more expensive); do not make their guest sleep with open windows. There is nothing the hotel can do as they shut off the air to the whole building! More sour, when our check out came around I called the front desk to explain that we were going to be delayed due to the fact that my boyfriend became ill, and we were stuck all the way on the other side of town, they gave us one hour. To our surprise when we make it back to the hotel (2 hours late) they had charged us an additional $200!!! After explaining to the manager (an over weight red head) our situation, my boyfriends sickness and the fact that my nose was bloody my whole vacation, she felt the least bit compassionate and did not waive the fee or at least bring the price a bit down due to the circumstances. I found her and her employee (a thin colored woman) very rude. A word to the wise, do not come one minute late to check out as the Affinia will not consider you. My opinion is that the hotel is not all that bad, and if your ok with what I鈥檝e mentioned, then I would recommend. But the Fitzpatrick which is near is way superior and the difference in money is well worth it.

<Content>Loved loved loved this hotel I just returned from a girls trip to NYC and we stayed in the Affinia 50. I found it through tripadvisor.com, read the reviews, decided to book it and couldnt be happier. It was perfect in evert way. The staff treated us like royalty, gettin all the cabs, taking care of all luggage and always welcoming us home Our hotel room was very spacious and 4 of us had NO problem gettin ready. The beds were extremely comfy, there were plenty of mirrors, the noise outside was MINIMAL ! The bad reviews i read on here stated that the rooms were noisy and that the other reviews weer overrated...but i can promise you, they are not ! It was reasonably priced, and i would stay here again and again ! Its close to times square and other grat locations !!! if your looking for an upper class hotel without the huge expense, CHOOSE AFFINIA 50 !!

<Content>Affinia 50 New York: Terrific hotel! We stayed at the Affinia 50 for one night while we were having some work done in our apartment. (We live in New York.) When we checked in, we were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite. The suite was large and immaculate, well furnished, had two TVs, and included a nice sized bedroom, very comfortable living room area, and a full (small) kitchen. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was quiet. The hotel is well-maintained and has a very attractive large club room area with two flat screen TVs.We chose the hotel based on reviews on this site. We got a very reasonable AARP rate. There are a variety of restaurants close by and a supermarket for those who plan to use the kitchen. We know that we will recommend this hotel to visitors from out of town.One tip: If you want a quiet room, mention that when you check in. We'd read that rooms that face Third Avenue can be noisy.

<Content>Great place, Great people! Myself and 3 friends just got back from a trip to NYC where we stayed in the Affinia 50 on E 50th Street. All I can say is Excellent!!!The room was very spacious and had plenty of mirrors (which was important for us as 4 young girls). We got a pleasant surprise when we saw we had a full kitchen too! The room was clean and beds were super comfy! I have to say something about the doormen. They were the nicest, most helpful people ever. They open the door for you, get cabs for you, look up stuff online for you (e.g. if you don't know the address of the restaurant you want to go to). They will help you in any way they can. We pretty much felt like celebrities :)All in all, the Affinia 50 is a great place to stay and in a convenient location. Brilliant!

<Content>Great base for exploring NYC We chose this hotel after seeing all of the reviews on Tripadvisor, so I thought it only fair to add our feedback. We were very pleasantly surprised to find that the reviews on this site had not exaggerated! The hotel is not the swankiest I鈥檝e stayed in but it was a good value mid price hotel. The rooms were clean, very comfortable and an excellent size for New York, the staff were consistently helpful and friendly and it is perfectly located for all the usual tourist sites and there are lots of good local restaurants close by too - what more could you need! On the negative side, our room was very warm, so we needed the aircon running during the night, but wasn鈥檛 a big issue. Overall, we had a great time, would be very happy to stay here again and will be recommending the Affinia 50.

<Content>Good value for money A group of 4 of us stayed here for 4 nights.It was alot cheaper than other hotels in Manhatten we looked at booking.The room was really nice and spotless. It was quiet spaceous as well as I was expecting it to be very cramped with 4 of us in the room but it wasn't.It was a bit of a walk to Time Square but there is a train station nearby and taxis are very reasonable.The staff on reception are very helpful.

<Content>Low key but friendly I have stayed at the Affinia quite a few times whilst on business trips to NYC. It offers pretty decent value for money and the staff try very hard to offer a friendly personal service. The rooms are decent and have all the main amenities, particularly if you opt for the bigger rooms with kitchens. The bathrooms are generally very small and it can be quite difficult manoeuvring around. I have no idea how a seriously overweight person could actually get on to the toilet!! Some rooms can be very noisy indeed particularly with garbage trucks collecting all night, and my experience has been to avoid rooms looking on to 50th Street or those onto the lightwell above the McDonald's extractor fans which sound like a 747 on a takeoff run! That having been said, overall the hotel is good, the public areas are small but well thought out and the staff are friendly and helpful. The lifts can be very slow indeed but it seems to be easier to get a taxi from here than most other hotels in the area.

<Content>Fantastic place We just returned from our NYC trip and stayed at the Affinia. After having stayed at many New York hotels over the years I have to say that the Affinia is one of the best overall values that I've expereinced. We had a full suite - more like an apartment - not one of those tiny so-called suites you find in some hotels, and it was very quiet given it was away from the street. The staff are all a friendly bunch, all helpful, especially Rome at the front door. Ask him if he's from Rome and you'll get a very funny answer. The overall service is a cut above other hotels (and many that cost a lot more money). We asked for two small repairs and they were done within minutes. We asked for a few supplies and they brought them (and more) right away. Every restaraunt choice they suggested was better than average. On top of the large accomodations, nice furnishings and quiet room, the suite's price was equivalent to a room in many less-stellar hotels around town. I rarely leave Manhattan saying I loved that hotel and will stay there again. Well, on my next trip to the Big Apple I know where I'm staying - the Affinia. There's only one small neagative I saw the whole week at this place. The room service isn't in house, but comes from a restaraunt across the steet. It's an Indian place called The Mint. The food we ordered came fast but it was on the equivalent of a bad diner - and a bad diner with very high prices. We didn't order Indian food (maybe that would have been better) but they had a selection of Continental dishes. Speaking of diners, there's a great one (can't rember the name) about a hundred-yards east of the hotel on the same side of the street. Bottom Line: great location (next to several hotels, and conveineinet to Second Ave with more eateries than you could ever make it to), great, spacious accomodations at good prices and nice people working there. That's all refreshing in a city where getting even one of those things is usually considered lucky.... unless you're willing to pay $1,000 a night.

<Content>Fantastic Stay Great wee hotel, with professional, friendly, curteous and above all - helpful staff. They had answers for all of our questions, eg where to eat, transport arrangements, map info, must see places, must do things etc etc.The Hotel itself has a small but cosy lobby with fast lifts to the upper floors. I willnee go on about the hotel because we just used it to sleep. But it was quiet, the rooms were big and comfy and the tea/coffee facilities were excellent. Oh and the bathrooms were clean and the shower worked well.What more could you ask for?PS Two great cafes for your traditional American Breakfast's'ss's just one block left the other a few yards right, as you come out of the hotel.

<Content>2 Thumbs Up! Wow! We stayed there after reading through the reviews on Tripadvisor and were thoroughly impressed with the hotel and staff. I wanted it to be very special as it was our first trip to NYC and my husband's 40th birthday. I would highly recommend this hotel. The rooms are very large, the location is great, walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Broadway shows, and you will feel like family because of the courteous staff. I would also highly recommend going to see Wicked. It was phenomenal. We will surely stay at Affinia 50 next time we visit NYC.

<Content>Warm welcome from the Affinia 50 Booked the hotel on the back of reviews on Tripadvisor and was not disappointed. I booked a standard room for my husband and I and a studio suite with 2 queen beds for my parents. The standard room was nice with a very comfortable bed but if you can afford it get the studio suite as it is very spacious with a small kitchen and livingroom area. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. I also liked that they 'welcomed you home' each tme you came back to the hotel.For breakfast we ate most days at the Luncheonette cafe which is about 3 doors down from the hotel where full breakfast with drinks was about $15. We also ate breakfast on our last day at the restaurant at the hotel next door (think it was called Ferros) which had a fixed price buffet breakfast for $16. This was very good value as you could have fruit, cereal, cooked breakfast, pancakes, the works!Hotel was in a good location although it was easier to get downtown (on the 6 train) than it was from East to West on the subway.

<Content>Excellent Location We stayed at the Affinia in January for a romantic city break.It was freezing but New York was glorious.The hotel was welcoming, with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.Amazing location, but the view from our window was a brick wall.Excellent place to stay if you are just using it as a base, not too many luxuries, not somewhere to stay if you are going to New York for the hotels!

<Content>What a great location! Just checked out of the Affinity about 12 hrs ago and now back in UK. it was a great hotel. They gave us a room on arrival at noon eventhough they had been mad busy , the room that was ready was an upgrade so we were really pleased with the service. Such a big room for NYC, small kitchen etc. I really can't fault the service, room , linens , cleanliness or location. we were 5 mins walk from Grant Central Station, 10 mins from Rockerfeller centre, 20 mins from Central Park and 10 mins from Bloomingdales.between 6pm and 7pm on Floor 2 they have complimentary cheese and wine but we missed it every day we stayed as we were out and about in the city. Maybe next time !

<Content>I will stay here again! I totally loved this hotel, I can believe how cheap it was, about 150 dollars a night for a standard room. Great rooms, clean, comfy beds, many channes on the TV etc. And I think the rooms are really big if you look at other hotels in New York. Location: Perfect! Quiet, but in the middle of everything. We never felt unsafe like we've done when we've lived in Midtown. Staff: fabulous! Always a smile and willing to help us with everything. Tips: * The descritopn says that standard rooms got refrigeraters, but atleast ours was a full minibar so you can't put anything in it. * there's a great super market on 2nd avenue. Don't do what we did, wander the other direction.

<Content>Huge space for Manhattan Decided to book this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and the fact that there were 4 of us plus our one-year old son all staying in one room. That was a tall order for NYC!Front desk folks were very helpful. Arranged for a crib to be brought to the room. Responded quickly when our bathroom tub wouldn't drain too (mechanical problem).Room was quite nice, fairly modern. Full kitchen was a bonus. Bed was super comfortable. Room was quiet as long as you kept the windows closed (stayed on 7th floor). Bathroom was updated very nicely too with Aveda bath products.

<Content>very nice! My family and I spend a weekend at the Affinia 50 (me, my husband, and our eight year old son). It is a clean, beautifully decorated hotel in easy walking distance of many attractions. The beds and linens were especially nice. It has a nice lounge on the 2nd floor to rest in when you are tired of walking. The staff was wonderful; I don't think I have ever dealt with staff that were so polite. The hotel would be perfect if it were cheaper. Also, I don't recommend the breakfast buffet on the 2nd floor. It is okay, but not fantanstic, especially considering the price. You can get a better breakfast at the Ess-a-bagel place that is on the next block (and was recommended to me by the staff).

<Content>One more great review of affinia 50 I have to add to the collection of great reviews on this hotel. I just spent the weekend here and felt as though I was in an apartment not hotel room.  Every person we encountered all weekend (guest and staff alike) was happy, smiles all around. pleasant hello's and great conversations. From check in to check out we experienced quick friendly service from the staff. The door man, the bellman and the reservationist. were some of the best we ever experienced. We had a two bedroom suite with two bathrooms and two balconies. We hosted a lunch for some family members and everyone was really impressed. The room was large,clean and comfortable. We used the room on the second floor for tea and coffee a few times and all the guests seemed very relaxed and happy. The atmosphere is exactly what most would want. Except for those who like glitz and glamour. We were in NYC for mass at St. Patricks Cathedral and the hotel is just a 5min walk away. We also walked to and around central park which was lovely. For the room size and location I think we paid a fare price for nyc. My family thought we paid a lot more.

<Content>Top Choice! We stayed here for our honeymoon for 5 nights in September, and couldn't have been happier with the choice. We had a standard room (no kitchen, but you don't go to New York to cook) which was plenty big enough for 2 people. Bed was great, and bathroom was also big enough for everything. Aveda products were also fantastic (for my wife)!The hotel is close to everything - either by walking or subway, but we mainly walked. There is also plenty of restaurants to choose from along second avenue. I probably wouldn't recommend the one across the road from Affinia 50; it is an Indian one called Mint and had terrible service and pretty basic food. The staff at Affinia 50 are quite friendly, I won't go all out and say that every person is, but you tend to get staff on a bad day wherever you stay.The hotel also has a laundry in the basement which is great if you need to do some washing on your trip for less than $10.We didn't try the wine and cheese room as there is so much do do in New York that we were never back in time, but it looked nice.I would highly recommend the hotel for everything on offer in New York.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic - That sums it up ! I always rely on reviews on Tripadvisor, so it is only fitting really that I leave one for others. Just got back from New York, and Affinia 50, and could not wait to tell everybody how wonderful this hotel is. I cannot fit into words how great this hotel and location is, what I have written only scratches the surface !This is my 4th time to NYC and this is by far the best hotel, and location/area I have stayed in. The hotel is located right on the corner of 50th Street / 3rd Avenue.Room: Stayed in a standard room with queen bed, booked thro expedia at a deal of stay 3 nights get 4th free. The check in staff were polite, concierge/bell boys were helpful. Hotel room by NYC standards was a wonderful size, bathroom was a little small, but hey it's just a bathroom. Room had a queen bed, TV, desk, arm chair, mini bar, air con, safe, hair dryer, iron  board, pillow menu, tea  coffee making, free toiletries, plenty of storage. The bed was VERY comfy. Hotel: There is no bar in this hotel, but it is such a fantastic location - you don't need one. The free cheese and wine evenings are a great idea too, make sure you go to them. There is a gym (didn't use), and a business room where you can get internet access with printing facilities.Location: Just fab. There are two metros close by - one at the end of the street, and another one street up (giving 2 different lines for easy access around Manhattan). Because you are a couple of Avenues away from busy 5th Avenue, walking around the streets / Avenues is easy, and a lot lot quieter. We were at the back of the hotel and could not hear a thing.There are some lovely bars and restaurants nearby - I recommend The Emery Bar (part of Benjamin hotel) for a nice drink and people watching. Restaurants: Plenty within a street or two. Out of the Hotel, turn left, cross 3rd Ave and walk down to 2nd Ave, there are lots of nice little places to eat here away from the mad hussle  bussle. Recommend Lasagna Restaurant. I also recommend going to Luncheonette Cafe, which is about four doors away, for a hearty breakfast. Usual fry up stuff, or bagels, fruit etc etc. Good prices too.I will most certain return to this hotel and area without a doubt, it is just the best. It is quite an affluent businessy area of NYC, so is very safe on an evening too, not at all seedy.Please stay here, and enjoy !!

<Content>Loved this hotel My friend and I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in September and thought it was really excellent. We had a really big room which had 2 comfy double beds and plenty of space to move around in. Everything was clean and the decor was good. The kitchen was a bonus and we were able to make our breakfast: tea and toast every morning. The fridge was big, plenty of room in it for supplies and there was even a full size cooker. However, a small table with chairs would have been good in the room but as we only had breakfast here it wasn't a problem. The location was ideal for the subway and also for the downtown hop on/off bus (at the Waldorf) which we used for 2 days a great way to see around the city. There were some grocery shops nearby as well as cafes and a choice of restaurant.s. The hotel is within walking distance of Central Park, 5th Avenue and the 'Rock' and it felt safe to walk around the area at night. The staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful and Rome and Manny get a special mention, two great guys. It is good when staff actually remember your name and acknowledge you as Rome did. We had a problem with our safe late one night and it was fixed very quickly for us. This is the only place we would stay in New York now.

<Content>Affinia 50 - Absolutely Faultless! Having decided to travel to New York to get married, my husband and I wanted a really nice hotel that wouldn't cost the earth. There were so many hotels to chose from that we decided to go with the Affinia 50 based on the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. Even before leaving the UK we were impressed with the service, as the concierge at the hotel could not have done more to help us with our wedding arrangements, organising flowers, hair and make-up, limo and restaurant reservations.On arrival we were delighted to have been given a complementary upgrade to an enormous suite on the 21st floor with large living and dining area, fully equipped kitchen, balcony and bedroom with king size bed. The room was modern and spotlessly clean.The rest of the hotel was well presented with a small modern lobby and lounge serving continental breakfast. The hotel doesn't have a huge amount of facilities, there isn't a bar or restaurant, but you're in the middle of New York so who wants to stay in the hotel anyway!It's in a great location just a few blocks from Saks 5th Avenue, the Chrysler building and Bloomingdales. It's also close enough to walk to Grand Central Station and Times Square. However the location is also nice and quiet (for New York) and we didn't have any concerns walking late at night.All the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful and did everything they could to make our stay special. We would definitely stay at the hotel again and would highly recommend it.

<Content>Good Quality Hotel Booked a Queen size room for 5 nights. Room was a good size but was let down by small, tired looking, bathroom, though like the room the bathroom was very clean.There was some noise from road as we were on 3rd (2nd in UK) floor, but we expected that and it wasn't too bad.Staff were friendly and always willing to answer our queries. Recommended a good organic supermarket on 2nd Ave, where we brought fruit and yoghurt for breakfast, as we didn't use dining room in hotel.Location was handy for tourist bus, Rockefeller Centre and Grand Central, and just a short walk from a couple of subway stops.Only used Club Room on last day, before leaving for the airport, which was very relaxingHad an absolutely fantastic time in New York and only used the hotel as a resting place, but it met our requirements and don't have any complaints.

<Content>Is the Dollar this Weak? Stayed at the Affinia 50 for 4 nights in August based on T.A. reviews. In a city with great hotel choices this is a very poor one. The lobby is small and shabby. The room was Holiday Inn quality at best. Elevators were slow, crowded, and shared with service people and employees. The staff are more engaged with each other than you. Needed to print a airline boarding pass in the business center. The printer was out of ink and no one knew how to refill it. I am a frequent traveler to NYC, and even with inflated hotel prices you can do better than the Affinia at over $325/night. The majority of my fellow guests were not Americans who either had a better deal than I, or just were benefiting from the weakness of the dollar.

<Content>Awesome free upgrade! We booked for 4 nights at the Affinia 50 and got a great deal on a room rate compared to other hotels in the city. We checked out reviews and felt that the hotel would meet all our needs. The hotel actually far exceeded both our needs and our expectations. The entry of the hotel isn't grand and amazing, so I wasn't expecting much but didn't really care as long as it was clean. We were given a complimentary upgrade upon arrival, which turned out to be a huge suite, probably bigger than my own apartment in Texas. It was incredibly comfortable, clean, and pretty updated. I loved the bed, the pillows, everything was perfect (though the bathroom just a tiny bit small compared to the rest of the huge place!). The bedroom alone would have been plenty big for our stay - I actually felt guilty not using the kitchen/dining/living room area that much, since we spent so much time exploring the city!The staff were always so nice, friendly, and accomodating. If we wanted clean sheets, a new blanket, directions, restaurant advice, it was all readily available. Hotel location was perfect, too. This was my boyfriend's first trip to NYC, and we wanted to go everywhere in the city. We were a quick subway or taxi ride from everywhere - so convenient. We went everywhere from uptown, central park, museums, all the way down to Soho, the village, and battery park.We loved the hotel so much that we asked if we could stay three more nights in the same suite for our original price (we had planned on moving to somewhere slightly cheaper). The manager was so accomodating and gave us a great deal.I will absolutely return to Affinia 50 and highly recommend it to others!

<Content>The staff is superb My friend and I just got back from a week at the Affinia 50, our new home away from home. The one-bedroom suite was great 鈥?very spacious, high quality furniture and beds, nicely decorated, Aveda shampoos and soap, and a kitchen that allowed us to prepare some organic meals for ourselves. It was close to everything, especially once I realized the E subway line went across town and then down to Times Square. But my main reason for wanting to write this review is the staff. From the doorman to the front desk to housekeeping - everyone made us feel they couldn't do enough for us. We were warmly greeted by the doorman Rome who looked out for us all week. When it rained, they had umbrellas for us. When we asked for a local Mediterranean restaurant, Jill, at the front desk, printed out menus and reviews for four places near the hotel and delivered them to our room. Anything we needed, we just called the desk and they took care of it within minutes. Paula kept our room meticulous. And everything was done with a sense of them truly wanting us to have a great stay. Whenever I thought we might be asking too much, they made me feel like it was their pleasure to serve us. I say thanks to you all. I will return.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel is excellent value in Manhattan. We stayed there for six days with our three month old son and the staff were so friendly.The room was large and spotlessly clean. Not only was there a crib for our son with clean bedlinen but they provided him with his own shampoo and other baby products; a nice touch. Although there is only a small restaurant, there are some great diners near by and some of the restaurants will deliver to the hotel.It is also centrally located. About ten minutes walk from Times Square and fifteen minutes walk from Central Park.

<Content>Wow - what a stay ! Stayed 4 nights here as part of a family holiday in the US. We picked the hotel primarily as a result of review on Tripadvisor and, as ever, it was the right thing to do.We booked a deluxe 1-br suite and it was stupendous. Spacious, clean, modern comfy furniture and even a great balcony...on the 21st foor. The bedroom was separate from the large and bright lounge where the sofabed was, with a kitchenette in between. Perhaps the only complaint could be the small bathroom but not a big deal. For a change: a NYC hotel with modern furniture (reminded me of Parker Meridien at times).Staff were friendly and helpful - we did not use the club room much but it looked great. Not a 5* hotel but a great find nonetheless.If you can afford it (not cheap): stay here with your family and they will love it. We will return.

<Content>Excellent Hotel! We recently returned from a 2 night stay at Affina 50 in New York. This was our first trip to New York, but it won't be the last. A large part of our return will be due to the excellent location and service at the Affinia 50. The staff were courteous, helpful  friendly. Our room was extremely comfortable (great bed  pillows!) and the location of the hotel can't be beat. Everything possible one might want to do in the city is either within walking distance or easily accessed by subway. Most importantly, we felt welcome and safe! I'm already looking forward to our next trip  stay Affinia 50.

<Content>Loved Affinia 50 We selected Affinia chain because of Trip Advisor reviews and were not disappointed mainly because of the excellent level of customer service. Everybody (the front desk stuff, the bellmen, the maids, the engineers etc) was extremely helpful and attentive.This is not the luxury hotel but if you travel with family, you can not go wrong.

<Content>Good Hotel, great location I booked this hotel based only on the reviews from this website. The Hotel location is fantastic, we soon learned that taking a taxi was not worth it, just walk, or jump on the subway. Great staff, very clean room.Some of the best food and shopping can be found within 5 mins walk.A few points to not but note even worth mentioning. The room was spacious and very clean. Shower could have been a bit better but good enough.Will book it again when we return.

<Content>Fantastic stay in NY I can't rate the Affinia 50 highly enough. We have just returned from a weeks stay with our 4 year old daughter and it was a real home from home. Location is perfect within easy reach of central park and fifth avenue with subway close by and you can pick up the circle line tour bus from the Waldorf astoria on 50th and Madison.The junior suite was a perfect size for us and it was lovely to have the kitchen you can stock up at the Food emporium on second ave at 51st st if you don't want to eat out constantly.I was so impressed with the little touches provided by the hotel - we booked the family package and received a frommers kids NYC guide and numerous leaflets, books and maps which were invaluable.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again so if you're considering it just go for it you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Just perfect This hotel was just perfect.Great location close to all attractions and directly opposite a car hire station. Large room with two queen beds and even a kitchen. Internet available at small cost. The beds were unbelievably comfortable. The room was quiet and the air conditioning was effective without being in any way intrusive.The staff were fantastic. Really helpful. The doormen all went out of their way to be friendly and offer advice.The hotel also had a lounge on the second floor and a fitness suite.I can't think how it could be improved. If we ever go back to New York there is no question at all that we will return to this hotel.Just perfect!

<Content>Great location, friendly staff This was our second stay at Affinia 50 and we weren't disappointed. It's not a luxury hotel but the rooms are large for NYC. There is no bar on site or fancy restaurant but if you want good, clean, well equipped accommodation in Mid Town then you can't really go wrong with A 50. The staff are friendly and very helpful. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel to stay with kids We stayed at the AFFINA 50 in July for 2 nights with our 3 children aged 6,8 and 9. We were pleasently surprised at the size of the room, there were 2 double beds and a sofa which pulled out to a double bed also. There was a small kitchen which was a bit dated but we did not use it so it didn't matter to us. The beds were very comfortable and the kids loved the big flat screen tv. The location was really brilliant and within easy walking distance of so much. I would stay here again.

<Content>great hotel!! best I've stayed at in New York!! big rooms!! stayed with my 2 kids and husband for 3 nights!!! by far the biggest rooms in NYC I've ever stayed in. Location is great- 2nd avenue is 1 block over and has tons of great restaurants, subway within 1 block and most major sites within walking distance!! Loved having the kitchen- with the 2 kids it was such a luxury to have. The bathroom was a little small, but by NYC standards not small at all. Excellant customer service, staff.. ..we arrived on a Friday as well as about 8 other Very loud people on our floor!! The walls are relatively thin and the halls are not too wide... so if there are loud guests on your floor - you will hear them!! Other than that loved the hotel and would definitely stay here again!!

<Content>Pleasant stay Great location, room was large and clean. After reading all the rave reviews I was a little disappointed as the lobbys / halls in the hotel as they are a bit tatty and it wasn't as fancy as I expected.However I am not too familiar with NYC hotels so perhaps my expectations were a little high.

<Content>5 Star Hotel!!! My daughter, her friend and myself stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 5 days last week. This was one of the best hotel stays I've ever had. Our room was on the 31st floor and we had a corner room. The views were spectacular. Everyone was completely helpful. We were complete novices in the big city and the staff was always helpful and friendly. After seeing some of the other hotels that I was considering choosing, I am sooooo glad that we chose this one. We chose the Dumont because of the reviews on this website and they were completely on target. Thanks for making my daughter's graduation trip so wonderful.

<Content>Great Hotel/Apartments. Excellent Location. I'll keep it brief...This hotel is in a great location, less than one block from the Waldorf Astoria, and only a couple of blocks (2 min walk) to nearest Subway station. 5 min walk to 5th Avenue etc.Staff extremely helpful and friendly. We had a one bedroomed suite which was a pretty impressive size, much bigger than other places i've stayed in NYC.If you, like me, are going for a few days break in NY, i'd highly recommend this hotel. Once again, the location is ideal.

<Content>What a great little Hotel! We just loved the Affinia 50, made our trip to New York just wonderful. Really has a great location on 3rd and 50th in New York, 10 min walk to 5th Avenue, and then another 10 or so to Times Square. It's far enough from the hustle and bustle that you can get some sleep at night. Personally I feel Times Square is too full-on to stay right there. Plenty of space in the 1 bedroom suite, separate bedroom and living area. Tiny bathroom - but we coped. Handy kitchen for breakfast in the room, great coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Dos Camino's accross the road is great Mexican and Marguerita's the best in town! Has a great vibe in the evenings and is full of hip locals. The front desk staff were great, and all other staff were polite and friendly. Handy laundry in the basement wwhen you travel with kids its great to be able to do a spot of washing with out having to pay the expensive Send-out costs. Mani the doorman was awesome, always has a smile and the best tips around. If you have little girls, you HAVE to visit the American Girl Place store on 5th and 49th. They will be in heaven - but take pleanty of money!! I would absolutely recommend the Affina 50 for location, service, comfy beds and a great base for your stay in New York.

<Content>No problems at all I'm going to go ahead and give this one a 5. Big, QUIET, room (by Manhattan standards). GREAT location - walked there from Grand Central Station. Service was great. My cell phone died, and they actually had the appropriate charger available at the front desk. Convenient!

<Content>Could live in this place! I hesitate to write this as it is already getting rave reviews and I'm afraid I won't be able to afford this hotel next time around. However, it is fabulous. The room in particular. We reserved a one-bedroom suite with a king bed. Huge, well appointed and the kitchen alone must have saved us about $50/day. The kitchen was fully stocked and there is a great grocery store just one block North of the hotel on 3rd avenue. Staff was very friendly and made some great restaurant recommendations. Also in a great location. You just can't beat this hotel in NYC!

<Content>Fabulous My husband and I stayed at the Affinia 50 for our 25th Wedding Anniversay and we found the hotel to be excellant. Lovely big, clean rooms and the staff were very helpful and accommodating and because it was our anniversary they very kindly gave us a room with a balcony. The Affinia 50 is within walking distance of many of the main attractions. The hotel also offers complimentary wine and cheese Mon - Thurs from 6-7 which gives you the opportunity to speak to other guests which can help you plan your stay. We would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Affinia 50 is worth every penny! I have stayed at 7 different hotels while in NYC over the years and I must say that this was the best one I've stayed at to date. I dont normally write reviews of hotels but I loved my experience so much that I had to share. The hotel staff is professional, courteous, and very customer driven...we especially liked Rory (sp?)!!! We flew a red-eye and requested an early check-in the next day, which Rory happily accommodated us at 8:30am and checked us into an amazing, better than expected room. Aside from the professional staff, the rooms are bigger than any I've stayed in while in NYC. They're very clean and fairly modern (with the exception of the kitchen). But really, who gets a kitchen in a NYC room??!!??...so no complaints. The location of this hotel cant be beat. It's literally a block from the 6 line and 4-5 blocks from Rockefellar Center. It's far enough away from the craziness of Time Sq/Theater District but close enough to walk to (10 min walk). All-in-all, if you have the money to spend on this hotel, do it! You wont be disappointed.

<Content>Affinia 50 - Fantastic!!!! Did not know what to expect, as accommodation in New York is very expensive and the Affinia was quite reasonable by comparison.Arrived to Affinia 50 by airport transfer and greeted by very friendly and helpful staff.Received a free upgrade to a larger, self-contained apartment. Apartment was clean and huge! Location was tremendous! Sports lounge was excellent and I would definately stay here again!

<Content>Fantastic Stay! Fantastic experience at the Affinia 50! I have stayed in several hotels in NYC and have never had such a wonderful hotel experience. The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. The room that I had was extremely spacious and relatively unexpensive for NYC. The location was fantastic. The hotel is a short walk to Central Park, Times Square and 5th Avenue shopping. The subway is one block away. I have nothing negative to say about this hotel. I am looking forward to the next time that I stay at the Affinia.

<Content>New York's BEST place to stay!!!!!! I had read several reviews about this hotel and when we arrived we were thrilled!!!!! The staff was just wonderful!!!! The doormen upon arrival back after a LONG day of sight seeing always met us with Welcome Home. The rooms were spacious and housekeeping was the best. We stayed for 7 days and 6 nights with 2 adults and 3 teenagers and were VERY comfortable in a Jr. Suite. This was my 3rd trip to NY City and trust me....I have found a home in Affinia. This will be my ONLY place to stay when I return!!!!!

<Content>Great Palce It was my first trip to New York  stayed for couple of nights in this hotel, I had a great experience. The room size was good very different from what I had read  heard that in NY the size of rooms are really small. The beds were a delight, so comfortable that they would take away tiredness of all day. The staff very polite, helpful  served with smile. It is small bouquet hotel but OK for the price they charge. The location is great right next to the metro  very near to the center of the city. I will recommend it to everbody. Thanks folks for making my stay in NY a really memorable one.

<Content>A great place for a family to stay My family and I (wife and children ages 7 and 4) stayed there (1st time) for four nights Jun 8-12 and had a wonderful stay. It was as many people have posted previously. Excellent location, rooms are very spacious (we had a suite with a small kitchennette) and it worked out very well. Clean, quite (stayed on 14th floor and no street noise). I travel and stay in NYC yearly and will stay at the 50 again Good family-style Itailian restaurant on 2nd Ave (El Pescatori)!

<Content>Great value with huge rooms. I stayed here with my sister in late May in a Junior Suite with two queen beds. First impressions of the room were very positive - it was huge, clean and all the furniture was more than adequate. The small lounge space made all the difference, so coming back to the hotel after a day wandering around Manhattan, it was easy to relax on the sofa. Alternatively, the club room on the 2nd floor was extremely comfortable and quiet, and a great way to take a moment to relax (and get a free glass of wine).Couple of cons - the room was rather warm for the first couple of days and the air con only really kicked in during the weekend. Also, the lack of obvious stairs between the 1st and second floors meant that the lift was always in action - and with only two of them, there was often a wait before one turned up. $10 a day for Internet was also a pain - but you could access staples free internet from the club room - so that's always an option if you just need to check email.But those are minor concerns. If you're heading over to NYC for a short break, then the location (10 mins walk from the best part of 5th avenue, and right next to the subway), the spacious rooms and the friendly staff make this an ideal place to stay.

<Content>Great! Even has a balcony! We love this hotel! We had a corner room that had a living area, kitchen, back bedroom and even a small terrace, Loved having our morning coffee and evening champagne overlooking the street life. The beds were heavenly. I even tried out the pillow menu. Beautiful lobby, great location. Very lively and the staff superb! I have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for $700.00/night, but prefer Affinia 50 for it's quaintness and spacious accomodations. Plus, you don't have to pay $30.00 for a pot of coffee! Definitely recommend!

<Content>Great experience at the Affinia 50 We just returned from a trip to NY and stayed at the Affinia 50. We were very pleased with this experience and this hotel is a real gem. We reserved a one bedroom suite with a king bed. Initially when we got to our room we saw that we had a queen bed. We called down to the front desk and told them that we had reserved a room with a king bed. They told us they would get us a different room and in about 40 minutes we had a room change. We were given what must have been a deluxe room on the 21st floor. This was the best hotel room we've ever had. It was huge with multiple windows, very clean and nicely appointed. Our teenage son had his own space and we had ours. I would highly recommend this hotel especially if you are traveling with kids.

<Content>Cheers Affinia Our stay at the Affinia was a very good one. The entire staff is very accomodating and attentive. We were able to check in to our room very early after a 6.00am arrival in New York. This was very welcomed. We stayed in a junior suite on the 10th floor. The room was comfortable and clean. The temperature in the room was very easily adjusted and the street level noise was non existent. The beds are very comfortable. The Lobby area also smelled particularly lovely on more than one occassionThis is a location that I have stayed at before and it is a favourite as everyhthing is either within walking distance or a taxi ride away. The subway is also very close. This location is just great.One of the strong points of the hotel is the Club Room. This is a beautifully appointed area where breakfast is available in the morning and wine most evenings, but it is also a great area to relax or meet with vistors.We did not use the gym but looked it, it was clean and had the necessary equipment and towels.The room service menu from Mint looked delicious but did not have the time to try it.What sets this hotel apart has to be its gracious and attentive staff, the location and the Club Room

<Content>Good hotel, great location Stayed 5 nights at the Affinia 50 and here are my comments:Pro: Regarding NYC hotel standards, this one is quite good. Big rooms, well furnished, door and reception staffs are very friendly and very helpful. The location is great and there is a subway station near the hotel. Room service is very good, we had the pleasure to test it and really, there is nothing to say, the food quality is excellent. A big point for a NYC hotel: the hotel is clean! The hotel management is very professional (good job guys).Cons: Not many really. The rooms are showing slights of age, but clean and in my opinion it is more important. Some towels had stains; maybe the hotel should do the necessary to replace towels with stains... Our room was quite noisy (room in the 9th floor with view to the main street), but we are in NY the city that never sleeps.Would I recommend this hotel? Absolutely!Will I stay in this hotel again? Yes, without any doubts.

<Content>Great Stay Four adults stayed at the Affina on our trip to New York,the doorman gave us our first impressions which were lovely,so friendly.Our rooms were huge two of the most comfey beds I have ever slept in.We did have a problem with hot water,so they moved us straight away to another room which was just as big.They softened the inconvenience with a bottle of champagne which was unnecessary but greatly appreciated.The rooms were well decorated and funished,and kept cleanWe thought the breakfast was really good,lots of fruit,smoked salmon, pastries.Filled us up for the day for 拢7 UK pounds.We had a very nice time, finding the staff especially the doormen very helpful and friendly,only too happy to stop taxi(sorry cabs) and advise on eating places.Pax just down the road was very good for snacks etc.We loved their hats,and they were very free with the umbrella's,the weather was terrible the first day we were there.But they still had a smile.The only downsides would be,the road noise,but we were in the middle of New York.The lack of a kettle for us Brits who like a cuppa,we used the saucepan to boil the water.We would all recommend the Affina to anyone who was thinking of staying in New York

<Content>great venue We had been trawling through lots of reviews on tripadvisor for our trip to New York , undecided between a number of hotels , namely Waldorf Astoria, Affinia Manhattan and Affinia 50 , originally i wanted to go to the Waldorf....for no other reason than its global name , and it would be a giggle to have stayed where King Jofi Jaffa from Zamunda had stayed in Comming to America..but the reviews read indiferently..so we opted for the Affinia 50 ...Ok some pros and Cons.....Pro......position is fantastic , walkable to Rockafella, Grand Central,Central Park, Empire State,Chrysler, Times Square ...you know all the main attractions , Hotel is clean, staff very attentive, quality is great, we had a queen on the fifth floor....no no not Elton...a room..size was reasonable for a central New York hotel , only down side really was the smog hog machine below our room ...but hey ho its no worse than the air con running i suppose..they have a club room on the second floor (free wine/cheese 6-7pm) ad free coffee all day...great idea and a nice place to take five after walking the streets.The guys on the front door are very helpfull and have good knowledge of the ciy ...just ask them! We stayed 4 nights and had a great time there...the Cons...not many really , its not especially cheap...but then no where in town is,the corridor decor is showing slight signs of age ..or is it my taste?? i dont know and thats about it for the cons really ...would i recomend it ..yes definately , and would i go back , yes i would , without a thought.As for the rest of the trip, New York was what i expected and so much more , its fast , its alive, but everyone is laid back and cool with it all, We arrived on the Sat afternoon , in from Newark Liberty , we arranged a super shuttle transfer on line, cost 40 dollars each return...well worth it , dead easy pick up/drop off and collect from the hotel on the way back .est advise i can give would be to get down to Time Square asap and buy a ticket for the open top bus , they do three loops , uptown,downtown and a night loop...50 dollars gets you all three on a hop on hop off basis for 48hrs ..do the loops see where ya want to go, guides are excellent.for you guys who dont live in a city (like us) and dont use the tube/underground....dont be affraid of the subway..its cheap ,quick and safe, you can get from Rockafeller to Battery/wallstreet in 18 mins...Also ,dont buy into the empire state tour or the statue of liberty tour....get some discount vouchers for the observation deck on top of the Rockerfeller its fabulous! and go on the Statten Island Ferry...its free and goes right past the statue of liberty...World Tade Centre site will make you think and will almost make you cry...unless your one of those looney extremist!Central Park is just increadible , right in the middle of all the madness....tranquility!Shops bore me (the wife like em though) but they are all here and for all the nutter saddos out there the Apple Store is unnderground and looks like geeksville usa...that said ..i had to go in!tell you what surprised me the most ...the people...so polite , not as you would imagine, and very proud of their city , on a few occasions we looked a bit lost , map out, finger pointing..and regular people approached us asking if they could help or point us in the right direction...just increadible...or is it just our British ignorance? Traffic...traffic like you have never seen..its madness all day everyday...word of caution...the street crossings...when the hand is green...dont assume the traffic will stop for you!If you want any more info drop me an e-mail, no probsHope you have a good time if ya go

<Content>Perfect base to explore New York City This hotel is conveniently located on the corner of 50th St and 3rd Ave and provides an ideal base to explore this wonderful city. We stayed here for 10 nights on our honeymoon and had a huge 1 bedroom suite on the 12th floor overlooking 3rd Ave. The room was clean and well appointed with a neutral, pleasant decor and was serviced daily. There was a kitchenette and average sized bathroom and the bedroom and lounge/dining room were both of an excellent size. The bed was huge and comfortable with the added bonus of a pillow menu to choose your perfect pillow. The wine  cheese in the club room on level two was a nice touch as was the welcome home you recieve from the doorman upon returning but we didn't have breakfast in the hotel, instead prefering to try the range of diners and bagel places nearby. This hotel is adjacent to the main tourist hub, so you get the best of both worlds; it's quiet enough to relax after a long day of sightseeing, but close enough to a range of sights such as Rockerfeller Plaza, 5th  Madison Avenues and Times Square. If you're an avid walker (as we are) it's a most enjoyable walk to Central Park, and also downtown towards the Flatiron district. The number 6 subway stop is at the end of the block which is great for getting to Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall stop and Grand Central Station is only a few blocks away for getting downtown.There are a number of great restaurants (relatively) close, Asia De Cuba (on Madison Ave) and Brasserie Ruhlmann (at the Rockerfeller center) were two of our favourites. Overall, I can highly recommend this hotel as a fantastic base to enjoy all that this amazing city has to offer.

<Content>Just what we were looking for Based on the reviews from the site, I felt pretty comfortable booking at the Affinia 50 and we weren't disappointed. There were 4 of us (8  10 year old) and we had so much room. The location was great. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Rome, the doorman greeted us with a Welcome home when we arrived. The gave my wife a flower on Mother's Day when we checked out. Only negative was a smaller bathroom with 4 of us, but we used the mini-kitchen sink as an alternate place to brush teeth, get a drink of water, etc. I love finding out good things to do from these reviews so I will add in a couple. There is a bagel place just around the corner called Ess a Bagel. It was listed in our tour book as one of the best in NYC. We ate there 3 out of 4 days. For a family of 4, out breakfast bill came to about $14 each day. We walked to the Comfort Diner one day and that was a good sit down traditional breakfast place too. Two other family friendly places the kids loved, Ellen's Stardust Diner near Times Square. The waiters  waitresses sing between waiting on tables. The kids loved it. Food was pretty good diner fare too. The second place was The Peanut Butter Company in Greenwich Village. My daughter lives on peanut butter so this was one of her highlights. It was a small little hole in the wall and definitely off the beaten track. It was fun to get away from the touristy stuff and see real people(not tourists) going about their daily lives. You see apartment buildings  parks  pickup basketball games, etc. Kids loved the food and the general neighborhood feel.Since this was for the Affinia, I will wrap up and say I would definitely stay here again. Especially compared to the other options directly in the area and for the price.

<Content>A Decent Stay At Affinia 50 Affinia 50 is in a wonderful midtown location. For New York, you get a lot of room for the money. We booked a junior suite for my parents which was as large as many one bedroom suites in New York. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was the size of a small New York apartment.We have stayed at several NYC properties and this hotel did not provide the luxury of some of the other properties, but for the price, the room sizes and the location, we would consider staying at this property again.As a side note, they have complimentary wine in the lounge during the week and a movie for families on Sunday evenings.

<Content>Affinia 50 lived up to its Trip Advisor reputation! Once again, we'd read the good reviews and we were still pleasantly surprised. Large rooms (there were four of us including two teenage boys and there was plenty of room), very comfortable beds, great location and VERY good staff. They were friendly and helpful, even providing cakes and a card when I mentioned it was my son's birthday. We were on the 9th floor and it was a little noisy at night looking out over 3rd Avenue, but we were used to it by the second night. All in all a great place to stay as a base for a superb NYC break.We liked the luncheonette only a few doors down for breakfast, especially when we found out we were sitting in the same chair as Obama when he had eaten there! Recommend the little Italian restaurant on the corner of 50th and 2nd (about five minutes walk) called the Lasagna. Check out the NBC tour in the Rockefeller Centre and go up to the top of the Rockefeller at night. Virtually same views as Empire State, but NO queues! Our boys LOVE the NBA store, and definitely recommend a Knicks game at MSG if its the right time of year.If you're shopping for teenagers find the Adidas store in Soho, possibly the coolest shop in the world.

<Content>Great Home Base for NYC trip We stayed at the Affinia 50 from April 23rd through April 29th. We had a wonderful large corner room on the 17th floor. No view, we faced a wall, but I think that actually helped to buffer the street noise which was not an issue for us. This hotel was a fantastic home base for us for our week's stay. There were three of us, all adults and the location was convenient for us to drop in and recharge during the day as we saw the sights. I was most impressed with the professionalism and friendliness of the staff and with the cleanliness of our room. The beds were very comfortable and I do agree that the temperature of the room overnight was warmer than I prefer but we slept well. The kitchenette was a bonus, especially having the large refrigerator so we could bring home leftovers. Overall, I would stay here again and would recommend to fellow travelers for a decent sized room, a pleasant experience and a great location.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff I spent four nights at the Affinia 50 with my husband for our sight-seeing and shopping trip to New York. The hotel's location is excellent: Rockerfeller Plaza is just around the corner, as is Grand Central, and it is not far to walk to 5th Avenue for great shopping or Times Square. We did walk all the way to Macys. which is a fair distance, but plenty of shops and sights along the way so we found it an easy walk.The reception and door staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful, providing suggestions to answer our every query and a welcome greeting and goodbye every time we arrived and left the hotel. Plenty of lifts for the size of the hotel (no long waits).Rooms are small but nicely furnished - ours had two big beds, a desk and two chairs and a chest of drawers with big TV on top. Windows were high up and did not allow any view out (I assume the way we faced was not worth a view), so the room was quite dark. The bathroom was small but nice and modern and sparkly clean. Nice Aveda toiletries replenished daily. Our room was a bit too hot and the air conditioner they'd installed didn't work so it was a bit stuffy, but that's the only complaint of the whole stay.On 2nd floor there is a nice casual lounge room in which to have continental breakfast ($14.95 per person) and afternoon tea/coffee (free - just drinks no food). As this is just one floor above the lobby, I would not recommend having a room on this floor as we did as it can be a bit noisy when people are checking in late at night.Close to the hotel I recommend Pax (left  left again out the main door) for sandwiches, soup, salad type lunch. And Luncheonette (a couple of doors down) for breakfast/brunch.Definitely would recommend it and would go back, but would request a high floor and a room with proper size windows.

<Content>Home from Home We have recently returned from a short break to New York where we stayed at the Affinia 50 Hotel - part of the Affinia grup of hotels of which there a few in New York.We chose the Affinia 50 for it's location in Midtown just a few blocks away from the Rockerfeller Centre and within walking distance of hte southern end of Central Park.Our room, two queens size beds as there were three of us was on the 17th floor with views down on to 3rd Avenue. THe room was clean, tidy and all that you need for a short stay in New York as you only really need a place to sleep/recover from the hectic days.The staff were very friendly and most helpful and you have a pillow menu to choose from - we chose a buckwheat pillow and hypo-allergenic on but there are 6 to choose from.You can take breakfast in the 2nd floor lounge area but we chose to go to the local diner - 4 doors down the road - well worth a visit. On certain nights there is a guest welcome meeting - wine and cheese plus a chat which we managed to make on one occassion - again worth popping in if you have the time.We didn't use the on site gym but we did have a quick look in and it had everything you might need - if you have the time/inclination.We couldn't fault the hotel and New york was certainly a lot quieter over the weekend - once Monday came along things got a lot busier.A must is a trip up to the top of the Rockerfeller Centre - if it's a clear day you can see for miles and the views are spectacular. We chose to go up on our first day and it really gives you a better idea of the scale of Manhattan Island and the distances to the sites.You can catch the subway one block over on Lexington - take a trip to the Staten Island Ferry - about 15/20 minutes on the subway - by cab it could take up to an hour!!Make an early start and come back to the hotel late afternoon ready for a shower before hitting the light of Broadway for an evening show.Martin, Sally and Laura WardWokinghamUK

<Content>Great Location Just came back from a 4 night stay. It was our first time to New York City and we quite enjoyed ourselves.A little bewildering on why this hotel got such high reviews. The location was great and all the staff were supurb but the actual rooms were tiny and not posh like some of the other reviews had stated. It didn't help that we were only on the fourth floor with a view of a brick wall and close enough to the street that we could hear the traffic and horns going all night. Our room was no better than an average Best Western but smaller. Now from what I gather, this is New York so I shouldn't be picky, but for $300+ a night I expected a little more. Again I must tell you that the staff was great and very helpful.As far as location, I don't think you can beat it. Its close enough to the Time Square  Theartre district that you can easily walk the 10 or 12 blocks. Its even closer to the 5th Ave shopping area and just down the street from the Rockefeller Plaza. The subway access is just around the corner so getting anywhere in Manhattan is a breeze. Lots of early morning bagel joints within the area as well as lots of nice restaurants for dinner. You can't go wrong with this location. I just wish the hotel rooms were a little larger.A few tourist pointers. Get a good subway map from the hotel. Get a transit card from the subway entrance and load up $20 each on a card and use it.Skip the Empire State Building, we went at 10 PM and they say its only a 30 minute line up, but thats 30 minutes just to get to where you pay then you line up at the first elevator and then again for the second elevator. All in all, a 90 minute up and down for a 5 minute awe inspiring view with you and 1000 of you closest friends. Do the top of the Rock for the same price and no line ups. Take the subway to the Staten Island Ferry and go on (its free) and get a up close a personal view of the Statue of Liberty...both ways. Its about an hour round trip and everyone gets on the ferry as there are 3 or 4 of them going every 15 - 20 minutes.Buy your Broadway show tickets and the South Street Marina area where they have half off ticket prices but don't expect the block buster shows to be available.All in all, a nice stay, we just expected something with a little more WOW power.

<Content>Great Value and Big Rooms We chose the Affinia 50 for a visit with our 2 kids (ages 9 and 15) and were very pleased with the room, location and service. We often stay in NYC for business, and have stayed in many hotels and we were very impressed with the size of the room, the nice decor and the overall comfort. The front door staff is very friendly and efficient. I would highly reccomend this hotel for the value.

<Content>Beautiful New York We stayed at the Affina from 10/4/08 to 15/4/08 and had a trulywonderful stay. The staff were all so polite and helpful from the front desk through to the doorman and housekeepers. Having read a lot of the reviews we were aware of the couple ofnegatives that had been posted by previous guests.Yes the rooms can be hot at night and yes there is quite a bit oftrafic noise at night but this is New York after all- the city that never sleeps. Having mentioned the negatives though I would bequick to point out the positives far outweigh the negatives and wewould definitely recommend this hotel - a real Gem! We booked the city sights bus tour and thought it was a great way to see the city. The guides were brilliant with a great sense ofhumour and excellent value for money.We got around by a mixture of walking , taxi's or taking the subway. The subway is a great cheap way to get around. We tookour 2 children with us aged 8 and nearly 10 and both had a great time. The luncheonette a few doors up on 50th st does a great breakfast and sets you up for the day. The people of New York were so helpful , lovely and charming thanks for making us feel so welcome. Thank you to all the staff at the Affina for helping make our family trip to New York so memorable- at trip we shall never forget. Hope to return soon.A special hello to Sammy thre doorman. Love the Spiers family.xx

<Content>Very friendly service! We stayed 2 nights at the Affinia with our 3 daughter all under the age of 12. It was fantastic. We had a junior suite and it was so spacious. I never would have expected this much space in NY. There were 2 queen beds and a pull out sofa. We loved the pillow menu and chose the memory foam and sound pillows. The kids loved plugging their ipods into the pillow and being able to listen without head phones. We went to the continental breakfast 1 morning. It was good. I had thought that it was a bit pricey but the previous morning we had spent $63 on breakfast next door, so $51 for a family of 5 seemed like a bargain. Our room also had a full kitchen that was very nice. We didn't use it but next time we would, at least for breakfast. One of the best things about the hotel is the employees. They are so polite and friendly from Sammy who helped us with our luggage to Joan the housekeeper. The doormen were great too. I would definitely recommend this hotel. It exceeded my expectations.

<Content>Great Hotel, very friendly service Spent a few days in NYC with the kids and was looking for a hotel with some room. The affinia 50 did not disappoint as these rooms allow ample room to spread out. The beds were great. The hotel is showing a little bit of aging but is still quite quiet for being in NYC. Staff were so friendly with our young children. Easy walk to the subway and the sites.

<Content>Great hotel My daughter and I stayed at the Affinia 50 Hotel, 155 East 50th Street (on the corner of 3rd Avenue) in New York City, from Thursday 10/4/08 until Monday 14/4/08.The hotel was immaculate, great value for money, staff really helpful and pleasant. Guest Room a great size (even though we thought they would be much smaller).Great location. Close to the Chrysler building and 50th Street takes you right into the centre of Rockefeller Centre and close by Times Square.Would defintely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Good Hotel Stayed here for three nights in February. It's a really good hotel in a great location. I had a problem at check in as my room wasn't ready but after that the hotel staff were really helpful. They recommended some great restaurants and had a great knowledge of the area. The door staff were great too - very helpful in the freezing weather in February. I think the hotel is really good value - particularly with the current dollar rate. Our room was classed as a suite and was a really good size with two double beds and a small kitchen. The only down side was the breakfast which was one of the worst I've ever had. There was a breakfast place a couple of doors down which looked great but was very busy. Overall would reccommend this hotel with the plus points being the rooms, the staff (apart from when I checked in!) and the location.

<Content>Super stay We stayed at the Affinia 50 at the beginning of April for five days and, like almost everyone else, found it to be an excellent choice. Before arrival I had emailed Joseph Rauer to advise him that we would be arriving before the standard check-in time and he told us he would make sure that one of our two rooms was ready for us early. In fact, they both were, which was great. (He also let us have a late checkout on the day we left, which was brilliant). We had upgraded to junior suites on a high floor for both our rooms and were delighted we had. There was so much room in my son鈥檚 room on the 16th floor that I think it was bigger than my first flat! A complimentary bottle of wine and large nut assortment in the rooms went down very well and were a nice touch. The beds are very comfortable and although there is noise from the street I didn鈥檛 find that it stopped me sleeping and I am usually very restless when I'm away from home. The rooms are clean and simply decorated and although the bathroom is small it is so well stocked we didn鈥檛 have to bring our own toilettries. Yes, the kitchens could do with a facelift but they are functional and it meant we could enjoy a coffee and bagels from Ess-en-Bagel on 3rd between 50 and 51st Street in comfort. I know people have recommended the lunchonette but we found it overpriced and my son was sick after eating there on our second day. The staff, from front of house throught to housekeeping, are all great - helpful but not in your face all the time. The doormen were lovely with my teenage son, even when they discovered he was a Knicks fan! The night we had to cancel our arrangements because my son was ill we asked one of the guys on reception for a restuarant recommendation and were directed to a noodle shop close by. It doesn鈥檛 look much at all but if you're after cheap, good Chinese food then Mee鈥檚 on 2nd between 49 and 48th Street is a good bet. It鈥檚 well located to reach almost everywhere you might want to go with ease and if we go to NY again I鈥檓 sure we鈥檒l go back to the Affinia 50, too.

<Content>Keep coming back This is our third time to stay in the Affinia 50 and it still amazes us. The staff are terrific and even remembered us from our previous visit last year. The service across the board is without compare, friendly, professional and always quick with a smile. The lack of a bar and reastaurant is no handicap whatsoever. We are already talking about dates for a return, it cannot come soon enough.

<Content>Great base to explore New York We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of Feb/start of March. We based our choice on the great reviews on Tripadvisor, and were not diappointed.The staff at the hotel were always friendly and accommodating, and extremely polite. When returning after being out for the day the doorman would be sure to say 'Welcome home'. This was our first trip to New York, but everyone tells us about the tiny room sizes - this was an exception. Our room was actually pretty huge - although the kitchen was tiny, but adequate. Well decorated, lacking for nothing. Air con / heating was quick to adapt to new settings. Only complaint would be the noise. Again, not having stayed in NY before, maybe this is the same everywhere, but we were shocked by the incessant noise from the traffic on the street below - we were on the 5th floor. The cabs honking drove us mad as it happened every few seconds, and started early and finished very late. Location-wise we thought it was great. Out of the very touristy areas around Times Square etc, but still within easy reach of everything. We mostly walked everywhere and found it no trouble - although on the 2 occasions we used the metro we found the nearest stop was only 3-4 mins walk away.Breakfast was good - although a greater selection would have made it better, but then I always think that in US hotels. The club room was great, mostly there was only ourselves and perhaps one other set of people there. You could sit and relax, read a paper, have a free coffee/snack. They actually say that you can return the to club room on any future trip to NY, even if you don't stay at their hotel. I think this is a bit of a gimmick as they know most people won't take them up on the offer, but I will certainly bear it in mind if I return to New York.The lifts were reliable and quick - I have been to places before where you have to wait ages to get up/down which is not fun if you are several floors up - but no such problems here.One thing lacking was wireless internet access. Not a huge problem, but it's pretty standard nowasdays and would have been nice to have. You could pay for wired-in access but it was quite steep per day so not worth it.Overall thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely return.

<Content>Great all rounder but not luxurious Just came back from a week at the Affinia 50 which I booked on the strength of the Trip Advisor reviews. It was not the gem I expected after reading the glowing reviews but we were very happy and comfortable there and all-in-all the good points outweigh the bad points. However the number 9 rating out of all the NY hotels is hard to justify and might mislead future guests. It's a very nice place to stay and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful but it's certainly not one of the top 10 hotels in NY! I have stayed at many of the big luxury NY hotels on previous business trips (including the Pierre, Plaza, InterContinental, Royalton, Sheraton etc.) and they are in a different league even on a bad day but then they are probably twice the price of the Affinia. So go to the Affinia if you want a nice comfy hotel that is clean, friendly, well located and economical especially for families and groups but don't expect luxury.I was there on my own with 2 teenagers and we had a Junior Suite on the 10th floor. The room was big and very comfortable but the decor and furniture was pretty basic and the kitchen and bathroom were a bit dated (tho perfectly functional). The towels had also seen better days so I wasn't too excited about the Aveda toiletries (don't people bring their own stuff?). The only real issue I have with the hotel is the noise from the street at night with the garbage trucks and other traffic. I bought earplugs from the pharmacy in the end otherwise I would have had a sleepless week. The quality of the windows leave something to be desired so if I went back I would request a room at the back and as high up as possible. Good points:The location - very easy to walk everywhere and lots of places to eat locally or buy your own food. Highly recommend the bagel place round the corner on 3rd Avenue for breakfast but NOT the luncheonette a few doors away that other people have recommended - its not good at all!The gym - very small but they have modern treadmills and cross trainers and I was mostly the only person there in the morning.The free wine  cheese midweek - this is a really nice idea. The staff - enough has been said about them by othersBad points:The area/location - a bit tatty and not very picturesque but it's very central so that makes up for itLack of hotel bar/restaurantPrice of the extras - I agree with the previous reviewer that $10 a day for internet is ridiculous and $15 for breakfast is overpriced no matter how much you can eat.But I would still recommend it especially for families as you can sleep quite a few in the large rooms and self cater so that's a big plus....

<Content>Reasonable NYC accomodations, but sterile This hotel prompted a variety of impressions in my mind throughout the week I stayed there. Though there were good and bad impressions I'd have to say that in the end the bad overtook the good in many ways.First, a little about the area. I hadn't really spent much time in the east part of midtown for over 15 years. If you're a shopper and like the big department stores, this area might be fun. In my view it is lacking character and feels too dispersed, like a suburb. In certain respects it's still fairly convenient, especially with respect to the museums along the east side, the park, and Carnegie Hall. Yet, each time I left the hotel I found myself wanting to get somewhere else quickly. You really feel like your in tourist land. There's some modest relief if you walk a bit further east to 2nd and grab a pint at one of the Irish pubs.My initial impression of the hotel and lobby was that it had that modern, sterile appearance. Lots of brushed aluminum, marble, angles, plexiglass waterfall, etc. Boring. The room was much the same with a rather sterile, monochrome feel to it. With respect to size the room was admittedly a pretty good deal for NYC. Very spacious. Not a huge amount of closet space but enough. There was a desk and reading chair as well. The room was fairly quiet at night with the double-paned glass and substantial drapes even though 3rd is pretty much a non-stop stream of taxis until very late. If you like the feeling of being hermetically sealed off from your surroundings the rooms here may suit you well.The staff of the Affinia 50 were very nice and accomodating.Now, I have to ding the Affinia 50 in several respects:1. I'm not particularly fond of hotels that try to be elegant and yet have tacky minibars as the centerpiece of the room. 2. If you're going to give me a refrigerator, perhaps leave some space for the guest to store milk, beer, leftovers, etc., instead of filling it to the brim with overpriced drinks.3. $9.95/day for internet access these days!!? And no wireless!!? C'mon.In the end, though the Affinia 50 was adequate it just wasn't my type of hotel. Having stayed in NYC quite a bit in the last few years I've grown weary executive look and offerings.

<Content>Perfect home in the city The Affinia 50 exceeded our highest expectations. The room was huge by any standards. We loved the kitchen - we had coffee, juice, cereal and toast for breakfast in the mornings. The beds were plush and luxurious and they had a selection of six different types of pillows to choose from. Every member of the staff we came into contact with went out of their way to be courteous and helpfull. This is a very well-run hotel!

<Content>nice, but.... We stayed at Affinia 50 for 4 nights after reading all the great reviews at Tripadvisor. I must say: it is a very nice hotel, with friendly staff. But I am not sure if they are really the 9th hotel of New York.Positive:- Nice, friendly staff- Clean rooms- Nice decorated lounge at the 2nd floor- I found 14$ for such a nice Breakfast not too muchIssues to improve:- It is rather hot in the Hotel - We had a small issue booking a restaurant (the staff promised to do that for us, but at night we found out they had forgotten)- Kitchen looks old- Since the bathroom wasn't very large, it needs a fan- They should pay a bit more attention during breakfast (cleaning) The hotel is indeed located not too far from the main attractions. But it goes too far to call this a 'unique, perfect located hotel' Overall:We are positive and had pleasant stay. We were able to find a very good deal on internet ( $800,- for 4 nights), which wasn't there anymore after we booked. There is certainly a change that we would stay here again if we could find the same deal, but I doubt if we would stay here for over $1.100,- for 4 nights

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I stayed at the Affinia 50 for 4 nights in a one-bedroom suite in March with my husband and daughter. It was an overall great experience. The suite was huge--bigger than most apartments, especially those in NY! It had a large living room, separate dining area, small kitchen and a large bedroom. Only the bathroom was small--but the size of the rest of the suite made up for it. While it was not a super-luxury hotel, it was very clean and functional. The staff was always friendly, the location of the hotel was great, and the service was great.I travel to NY often for business and have stayed in many high-end hotels (often based on tripadvisor reviews). This was definitely deserving to be in the Top 10 list--I think it should be in the Top 3 myself. I would highly recommend it to anyone for business or personal travel.

<Content>Home from Home We returned last week from a 7 night stay at the Affinia 50 Hotel. Room was fantastic, staff were very polite and really helpful. Always nearby to lend a hand with getting a taxi or advice on nearby restaurants. Would not hesitate in recommending the hotel and will definitely stay there whenever we return to NYC!

<Content>Great place, but a few tips... My husband and I just returned from six nights to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We asked for a quiet location and didn't care about a view, and were given room 701, a junior suite that faces the side of the McDonald's building next door. It was well protected from neighboring room noise (it was sandwiched between a stairwell and a supply closet) and fairly protected from street noise, but more about that in a minute. The room was very large and clean, the bed and chairs comfortable, and the bathroom well appointed and perfectly adequate for two people (though more than two might find it difficult to store their toiletries). The bathroom desperately needs an exhaust fan, as it has no vent or window, and a couple of days when I attempted to shower around noon I had to wait about 20 minutes for hot water (this didn't happen when showering earlier). The kitchen could use a larger coffeemaker that takes regular paper filters, as we did not like the in-room Puck's filter bags and wanted to brew our own coffee. The Azure deli around the corner has a great salad bar, including items such as stuffed tofu, sesame noodles, and seafood, a hot foods bar, and many essentials such as boxed cereal, baked goods, sandwiches, and drinks, so we went grocery shopping there and ate breakfast in our room every day and also brought in deli fixings for lunch or dinner. A table and chair set would have been much nicer to sit at than the work desk, and the room was actually large enough to accommodate both, but we only had the desk.I had read some reviewers' comments about rooms being too hot, and they were right. In fact, the entire hotel is overheated, and the heat seeps in through the walls and floors to the point where our room was too warm even though we kept our thermostat turned off and at least one window open to the 40-degree air at all times, including at night. Fortunately the sound of traffic was nearly drowned out by the nearby rooftop air conditioning units, which created a nice white noise for sleeping. Unfortunately, though, the smell of McDonald's often wafted in. A fan-only setting on the heating/AC unit would have been helpful to keep the room cooler and less stuffy, but the only option at this time of year was hot air, because the hotel hadn't yet switched over to AC. We're lucky that we didn't arrive later in spring, because I can just imagine how hot and stuffy the room would be if the outside air were warmer than the 30 to 55 degrees it was during the week we were there! Also, there were no screens on the windows, so insects could be a problem if you have to have the windows open.I do have a tip for dealing with the small and crowded elevators: Stay on a lower floor and take the stairs! We were on the 7th floor and managed to take the stairs most of the time, though that last flight was a bit of a struggle after a full day of sightseeing, especially given that the stairwells were about 85 degrees and we were bundled in our overcoats.The second floor lounge is quite nice and well appointed, and has two computers with Internet access for guests. The trouble is, there's no regulation of usage, so when my husband went there the night before our departure to print our airline boarding passes he was stuck in a line with several other like-minded guests who were waiting for a teenage girl to stop instant messaging her friends. Her mother finally told her to get off--but then the mother got on and proceeded to check her own email! The other computer was occupied by a family happily uploading their photos to Flickr, apparently not knowing or caring that others had more pressing computer needs. The staff needs to set some limits for usage and supervise that area.Overall, we would stay there again, but only during the cold season on the quiet side of the building, or during the hot season when the AC is turned on.

<Content>Wonderful hotel - stay here when you visit NY For a first visit to New York with my 12 year old son, I booked the Affinia 50 based on the great reviews I had read on tripadvisor. We weren't disappointed. From the moment we arrived everything went without a hitch. Our studio suite with 2 queen beds was huge and came with a fully equipped kitchen. The bed was possibly the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and the room was kept immaculately clean on a daily basis. All the staff were really friendly, polite and helpful, and the welcome home from the door staff after a hard days shopping or sightseeing was a real treat. The location between 50th and 3rd is terrific. Walking distance to all the main attractions and yet still far enough away from all the real noise and hustle and bustle. We stayed on the 10th floor and traffic noise was not a problem. I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about a trip to New York. It's certainly not the cheapest, but you get great quality and comfort for your money.

<Content>Best in New York Just returned from week at the Affinia in a junior suite. Staff were all very helpful, courteous and friendly. Our accommodation was faultless both in size and cleaniness. We enjoyed the evening complimentary wine and cheese and the opportunity to socialize with other guests. The position of the hotel makes it so easy to walk to all locations that you wonder why anyone would choose to stay elsewhere. We did visit the Waldorf but its sheer size, lack of charm and impersonal nature just emphasised the 'home from home' theme of the Affinia. Full marks to Joseph Rauer and his team.

<Content>Simply the best!! We've just returned from a 5 day stay at Affinia 50 - picked, after a lot of researching, as a result of reviews on this site. What a super hotel - from arrival late in the evening until departure, again late in the evening - everything was spot on. Friendly greeting from concierge front-doorman Roman and the reception staff, super suite on 16th floor with bottle of bubbly on ice waiting for us [wedding anniversary]. Room spotless and kept spotless each day. Who cares if there isn't a restaurant here? Several places for breakfast in the immediate area. Dinner at night? No problem - speak to the 2nd floor concierge who's got a very good hands-on feel for the local area. We'd recommend Houstons [ downstairs in the Citicorp building two blocks away] - for dinner - super food and not too much for the British stomach!!Go to Affinia 50 - you'll have a super stay in the Big Apple.DW - UK

<Content>Even Better Than the Reviews The reviews were great but the hotel and staff were even better. Everyone from the doorman (who welcome you home) to the new GM Brian are so nice and accommidating. Sid and Jennifer handled all our needs (some even before arriving) at the conciege desk. Location is great too. Grocery,bakery,drug store,restaurants,deli and bars all are within a few blocks. Edward the bartender at MInt across the street makes great drinks. Pampano (mexican-tex) restaurant serves great mohitos and excellent ceviche. The guacamole is nice and chunky! Buttercup Bakery make some really moist and buttery cupcakes. I had not been to NYC since college (25 years ago). We went to a bar then and I really want to find it when we were there. Well to my amazement it was only 5 blocks from the hotel! It is called PJ Clarkes and it still looks the same with great burgers and oysters on the half shell. But back to the Affinia-all our requests were handle perfectly and quickly. The room was really large and not just by NYC standards. Bed was heavenly as were the pillows. You will not go wrong staying here and the price was very fair for the property, its staff and amenities

<Content>Amazing Rooms..awesome people This hotel is amazing. I have stayed here about 3 times and the room are like a condo. They have amazing beds, a ton of room--it looks like a mansion compared to regular hotel rooms in NYC. The staff is amazing and extremeley polite and very helpful. It is pricey to stay here..u defintely get treated like a king. The have a lounge on the second floor that we stayed in after we checked out and had a late show. We watched the flatscreen tvs on the couches by the fireplaces 3. Defintely worth the price.

<Content>Great place for a family holiday! We booked a one-bedroom suite (for a mixed work-holiday family visit to NY) at the Affinia 50 based on TripAdvisor reviews. We were not disappointed! From the friendly welcome, to the wonderful bellmen/reception/concierge staff, to the excellent daily service of the room, the staff were very courteous and helpful (e.g. with tips re. dining, visiting, etc.). Great location - near it all, but not in the middle of it! Subway nearby was very useful. Room was excellent - clean, bright, well-appointed and roomy. Kitchen was very useful, especially for breakfast - nearby shops helped us cater to fussy kids' tastes! Only blip was meagre in-house breakfast one morning - but on expressing our disappointment to staff, the charge was cancelled. without fuss. Would definitely return and recommend to others.

<Content>A Must Stay! Well, after reading many great reviews of Affinia 50 on tripadvisor, I booked this hotel for a period of 5 night and believe you me, it is all that people are saying it is.Size, Price and a personal touch is what makes Affinia 50 great.We arrived after a long and tiresome trip at the the front desk with an announcement that we booked a room with 2 beds (which was correct, at the time of my booking it a great deal), but you are only two, yes we are, so don't you want a queen size then?, nope thank you.They offered us complementary breakfast or Internet but I wouldn't budge.Anyways, we ended up in a Queen size Suit and after my initial anger I found out that this Suite was Hugde and why was I even making this a problem!Damn, if only I had taken them up on their extra offers, oh well, I guess I need to have a little more trust in people.For the paid price the location (50th and 3rd) and size are incredible.The only minus point I can find (looking very hard) are the temperature in the room, suggest to put of the heating in total and book a room as high as possible (we were staying on the 6th floor (and that is really noisy).The bed was really confy and so we the pillows.Bathroom has all you need (i was only missing some bathgell, would be handy when having a bath!!).For good and simple breakfast go next door to the lunchonette.Also nearby (if you are craving a good steak) go to Smith and Wollensky.For the best Bagels in town, go to 3rd ave. between 49 and 50th st., wait in line for heaven.And also please pay a visit to the concierge on the second floor (Sid), besides being a very funny and friendly guy, he can give you a lot of great tips.On our last night we went to a restaurant called TAO (on madison and 57th i think), great food and you are looking at a giant Buddha with a size over 2 floors.I was thinking of checking out another hotel next time I am in NY, maybe picking up a good deal for some 5 star hotel.But to tell you the truth why take the change while you know Affina 50 is the way to go.Oh before I forget the doormen are really helpful and friendly.Gotten some good tips and they even knocked on my door offering some free cheesecake, awsome!!

<Content>Quiet stay It麓s a quiet and familiary flat. The location is very good. Not very near but not very far from the attractions. Rooms are clean and large. Prince is good. Unhappily, there is no breakfast include. But there are many options around it. I RECOMMEND IT.

<Content>Excellent hotel. Just returned from a 7 night stay at the Affinia 50. The location of the hotel is great close to the subway and in a much quieter location than others we looked into staying at. Very happy that we booked at the Affinia 50. Booked here after reading reports on Tripadvisor and our stay was great. Large room with good sized bathroom and kitchen. Beds were very welcoming at the end of each day very comfortable, liked the pillow menu very nice touch. All staff were great very polite and helpful. We especially liked the Welcome home from the doormen on our return to the hotel. Really enjoyed our first trip to New York and would return in an instant and would stay at the Affinia 50 again without a doubt. All in all an excellent stay at Affinia 50 highly recommended!!

<Content>Not to happy The hotel came highly recommended from a friend who recently stayed in a suite and loved it. We had a single king room on a low floor. Room was ok but small. 2 high windows that you could not see out nor open. Room temp was in the high 70's with the a/c not available in the spring months. I should have realized a problem when I saw a table fan in the room. Hotel could not move us. We spent the whole night on top of the covers, very hot unable to sleep. This was not a room that should have been rented. If staying at this hotel make sure that you do your homework. Room was as expensive as any and better options available.

<Content>Great hotel! I had reservations at another property in NYC, and when I saw the room they had for us, we immediately canceled. 9:00 p.m. in the City, mid-week, and we are stranded in a hotel lobby, about to go online or start calling hotels looking for a room. I called one of Affinia 50's sister properties, and they were completely sold out, They were nice enough to check with their other properties, and they told me that Affinia 50 had a room for me. Affinia 50 was almost sold out; they had only had a deluxe suite available. It was one of their fancier rooms, and it was much more expensive than the disaster I had booked, but any port in a storm!Affinia 50's deluxe suite was fantastic. A large living room, well furnished, with a separate dining area. A large patio (it was too cold to enjoy this during our stay.) Fantastic views, looking both north and south on Third Avenue (obviously, I was looking from two different windows on opposite sides of the living room). Fully equipped kitchen. All I used was the fridge to keep sodas cold.Nice sized bedroom, with great mattress, comforter and pillows.I do not understand why, in a 550 + square foot suite, the bathroom was so small -- no counter-top space by the sink. But this was probably my only complaint about the place!Far more storage space than I would ever need in a hotel -- closets, cabinets, etc.There is a fitness center on the second foor. I checked it out just to see it. The usual array of machines, I guess.The Club Room on the second floor looked very comfortable, but I didn't spend any time there -- too much to do, out and about.I didn't try the $15 breakfast buffet, but that is a very reasonable price for a buffet in NYC. I didn't experience any of the amenities, so I have no comments. Front desk and bell staff were very nice. I was SO comfortable here. I am not sure how mcuh I will like the standard rooms for my next visit, compared to the deluxe suite, but it is definitely in my book for my next visit to NYC.

<Content>Great Hotel After reading several reviews and spending many hours on-line researching hotels, we chose Affinia 50 for a 4 night stay in March 2008. There were 4 adults and 2 older children on the trip. Our room was on the 18th floor and very nice. The beds and linens were deluxe---after seeing how many were in our party, they brought extra dishes, linens, robes and toiletries to our room. What impressed us the most was the service. When we returned from a day of sightseeing, we were greeted by name on the second night! The service is superior to many hotels that charge much more. I have stayed at the Doubletree in Times Square and Marriott Marquis in Times Square. I enjoyed the intimate feel and personal treatment we received while staying at Affinia 50 and would highly recommend this hotel. I also liked the quieter location, but still very accessible to the major sights and subways. It was nice to have the small kitchen to make breakfast every morning while we took turns in the bathroom. My husband used the club and took showers there every morning as well. We had a room with a balcony. If you choose this room, there is not room for a table and chairs too (except there was a table/chairs on the balcony that would be great in nice weather!)

<Content>Wonderful Place My daughter and I celebrated her 21st birthday with a trip to NYC. We stayed at the Affinia 50 for five nights. The Affinia 50 is in a great location. The subway was close, bus stops were near and cabs were always passing by. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. The area seemed quite safe and we often walked at night. Since I had read many reviews about small hotel rooms, I was quite pleased with our regular size hotel room. On the 3rd floor, we had a king size bed and there was plenty of room for a desk with chair, dresser, side tables and soft sitting chair in the corner. I liked the shelves in the bathroom that gave us room to spread out our stuff. I asked for a quiet room since I am not used to road noise. Although it had no view, the room was very quiet. We never ate the continental breakfast since it seemed rather expensive for us and what we would eat. We usually went the bagel place around the corner which was quite reasonable.  I would definitely stay here again. The hotel is a gem.

<Content>great Affinia 50 stay!! I booked my stay at the Affinia based solely on Tripadvisor reviews and I was not dissapointed. I emailed them prior to my arrival just to insure my requests (King, high floor, away from elevator, etc) and all were met AND MORE! I booked my stay for a regular guestroom and was upgraded to a one bedroom suite! The staff even acknowledged the special ocassion and gave us a bottle of champagne. The hotel lobby is small, but who cares? Affinia was about 10 minutes walking distance to Rockefeller Center and central to just about everything. The subway stop is 5 minutes away, deli, McD, liquor store are a couple doors down. Staff is friendly and accomodating.I booked my stay directly w/ the hotel to keep my options open... and it even ended up being less expensive. I checked rates up to the last week before arrival and was able to rebook twice at a cheaper rate!I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a comfortable, friendly, central hotel.

<Content>Awesome Awesome Awesome for a Girls Weekend! I stayed in the Affinia Dumont a few years back for a bachelorette party. When planning another bachelorette, I contacted the Dumont, but they were completely full. I was put in touch with Joe from the Affinia 50 - it was a pleasure to work with him! He set us up with an amazing two-bedroom suite on the top floor! This type of room setup had two queens in each bedroom, two living room areas, two huge bathrooms, and two kitchenettes. Granted, we definitely didn't need two kitchenettes, but having the two bedrooms and the two sitting rooms was definitely a plus! We also had a balcony off of one living room that overlooked the busy NY streets.The location was wonderful - we hopped around from bar to bar after having dinner downtown. We also walked to and from Grand Central Station. It was great!I don't even feel as though I need to say this, but the hotel was welcoming, the rooms and bathrooms were clean, and they were attentive to our every need. They set us up with taxis and had them waiting for us when we came down. The minibar was stacked with everything you could ever imagine, but it was expensive. We brought our own mixers and booze so that we could have a drink while getting ready. We brought some snacks and had them in the fridge for our return. There was another bachelorette party there as well. Great getaway for the girls!

<Content>Simply the Best Having stayed here last year,was pleased to see that yhe standards are as good as ever.Stayed in 1 bedroomed suite which is truly enormous,particularly by N.Y standards.Reception staff very helpful and doormen really friendly.Head doorman brilliant in arranging limo service at extremely competitive price(we were going to Brooklyn to join cruise,and had been warned that not many taxi drivers knew the way!!) but ours even asked if we wanted to go via Brooklyn bridge or tunnel(price for either had been agreed with Head Doorman.)Also love the 2nd floor lounge which is always peaceful and with complimentary coffee is a great place to relax after a hectic day First class location for all the sights/shops coupled with the excellent room space and service make this the ONLY place for us in New York(the cost is pretty reasonable too

<Content>Loved the Affinia - great location for a girls getaway! I went to NYC with 3 girlfriends for a long weekend getaway (Feb 14 - 18). NYC hotel rooms are notoriously tiny, so with 4 girls in one room, we wanted a hotel with a spacious room, and it had to be in a convenient and safe location. Affinia 50 did not disappoint! We got the studio suite, which had 2 queen beds, a kitchen, and a huge hallway where we could drop all our luggage. The bathroom was ok - fits a bathtub and a small sink (no counter). The hotel caters mostly to business travellers, so it was important for the rooms to be spacious, comfy and cozy.Good things about Affinia 50:1) The room (as discussed above) - you do have to pay an extra $10 per person per night if you have more than 2 people in the room. But since we were splitting the cost bewteen 4 people, it still came out to a very reasonable rate. 2) The location - the subway was 2 small blocks away, we could walk to Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center along with all the Fifth Avenue stores. Many little cafes, restaurants and grocery stores if you need to grab a bite on the go. Very convenient!!3) Amenities - there are complimentary cocktail receptions in the evenings (on weeknights), a club lounge on the 2nd floor, a fitness center, and most impressively - a pillow menu! The hotel offers 6 different types of pillows for you to try to guarantee a sound sleep. We tried the Swedish memory foam and the magnetic pillow - we had a great sleep every night! 4) Service - the front desk and the bell boy were all very helpful regardng transportation, restaurants and clubbing recommendations. The bell boy even came up to look at our leaky fridge (see below) as soon as I went downstairs to complain.Not so good things:1) Kitchen - the kitchen is very convenient, but the appliances are slightly outdated. Wouldn't matter if you don't plan on cooking. We did buy some beverages to store in the fridge, and found that it was leaking on the first night. The bell boy took a look, wiped the floor for us, and said that it should be fine the next day. And he was right! We're not sure how it got fixed.2) Elevators - there are only 2 small elevators, but 8 floors in the hotel. Sometimes, you have to wait a while for the elevator to come and when it does, it's already full. Overall, the hotel was great value and we definitely enjoyed our stay here. Would stay here again next time we're in NYC!

<Content>Wonderful Experience I stayed in a junior suite for seven days, six nights during the month of February. The room was spacious, comfortable and very clean. The beds were extremely comfortable and the kitchen was very useful for breakfast, drinks or reheating late-night leftover cravings. The staff was extremely professional and friendly. The midtown east location was perfect for our needs. I can't think of a single negative thing to say about the Affinia 50. We didn't have a decent view to speak of, but I didn't mind nor was I surprised since we received an excellent rate. It also would have been convenient if they would have offered free internet service, but I realize that it is NYC and they really don't have to. Otherwise, I hope to stay at the Affinia 50 again very soon.

<Content>Deserves its place in the Top 10!! My husband and I stayed here for 7 nights in February and absolutely loved it! We booked the Affinia 50 mainly based on the reviews on here and we were not disappointed. From the minute we stepped out of the taxi we were made to feel extremely welcome. Every member of staff we encountered was friendly, polite and helpful. They had even put a complimentary bottle of red wine in our room for when we arrived.Our room was a standard guest room on the 4th floor (#402). It was a large room with plenty of storage space. It came equipped with TV, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, tea and coffee making facilities and an in room safe. The bed was big and comfortable and the pillow menu is a nice touch.The bathroom was small in comparison but had enough space for toiletries and the shower was good. The aveda toiletries were topped up on a daily basis even if we hadn't run out!! The whole room was very clean and none of the decorations were looking in need of 'tidying up'The only small moan we had was with the heating. It was really hard to regulate the temperature.The location of the Affinia is everything. Its only a few blocks walk to 5th Ave, The Rockefeller Ctr, Grand Central Station and Central park. The subway is a block away and is very useful for getting downtown for Statue of Liberty ferries, Brooklyn Bridge, Soho and Greenwich.There are also lots of bars and restaurants in the area. The New York Luncheonette a few doors down is a good place for breakfast.We only used the club room on the 2nd floor once for coffee but it is a nice area to relax. If you want to check in online and print your boarding pass before leaving you can use the free service on the computers in the business centre. This is an extremely useful service and much better than having to pay the pricey internet rates.I would highly recommend the Affinia 50 to anyone travelling to NYC. Its my 4th visit to the city and its the best hotel I've stayed in by far. I'll definitely be staying here on my next visit.

<Content>Great place to stay when in New York Have recently come back from a stay in the Affinia 50 and couldn't find anything to complain about.Rooms were spacious, clean and modern.Staff were always helpful whenever we needed a question answered.Location of the hotel was ideal as we were within walking distance of many attractions (Rockefellar, Fifth Avenue, Grand Central Station) and other places such as Central Park were a little bit further but still reachable by foot.All in all a great stay.

<Content>We will go back to this one. Stayed in one of their roomy junior suites.The beds were very comfortable. The sofa bed mattress was about typical but our son did not complain. Staff were very friendly as promised. When one of our sons was sick, the cleaning staff accomodated their schedule around his need to rest.Excellent location that is walking distance from subway lines.Room was clean.Warning - the breakfast is not included and not worth the cost.Excellent bagel place--Ess-a-Bagel-- around the corner is a much better value.We have stayed at several NYC midtown hotels and every year we try a new one. This is the one we will stick with.

<Content>Comfortable Stay! Three of us booked an overnight stay when we came to the city to see a Broadway show. We got a terrific rate, as we came during an off-peak travel time of year, plus we were upgraded to a junior suite! The small kitchenette came in very handy when it came to storing munchies and dishing up the take-out that we ordered.The room was spacious and clean, the beds comfortable (loved the pillow menu), and the staff very helpful when it came to things like hailing taxis and recommeding good places to eat. And, on a frigid cold night, their friendly, Welcome home! was much appreciated.We had a lovely, comfortable stay, and would definitely go back again!!!

<Content>Great hotel, great location and fantastic staff Just returned from a 5 night stay and loved this hotel, The location is great, a nice walk to the Rockefella Centre, Times Square and v near to the subway. The rooms are large and clean - the kitchen area was a little small considering we had a junior suite but we did have everything we needed. Staff are very genuine and very helpful and nothing seems to be too much trouble. The wine and cheese evenings Mon-Thurs 6-7pm is a nice touch so give it a try. Would highly recommend the Affinia 50 and would happily stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic hotel - would return again  We stayed at Affinia 50 between 16-20 February. We had chosen it due to excellent reviews on trip advisor and we were not disappointed. On checking-in we were upgraded to a junior suite which was extremely spacious - especially for a room in NYC and we had a fantastic view south down 3rd Ave. The staff were fantastic, helpful and really friendly - Eduardo on reception, Sid the Concierge and the doorman to name a few. They made us feel right at home. We loved the extra touches such as the free cheese and wine in the evening and free tea and coffee. We thought the hotel was stylish and welcoming and will definately return here next time we come to NYC! I will certainly be recommending the Affinia 50 to my friends.

<Content>Nice hotel! We booked this hotel having pored over the many reviews of many hotels on Trip Advisor. We weren't disappointed. Room was huge, with two king size beds, a kitchen (with fridgefreezer, cooker, microwave  coffee machine), a nice bathroom, tv, sofa and everything we needed for a comfortable stay. All the staff were pleasant and helpful. The clubroom was nice and breakfast in there every morning was fair value at $14.95 (though watch out for the added taxes on this and everything else in the city). On 50th St it is in a perfect location, about 15 minutes to Central Park, Times Square, the Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Station and the shopping delights of 5th Avenue. In the immediate vicinity are plenty of bars, restaurants, take-aways, delis etc. We had a couple of minor gripes: 1) We had to wait 1 hour 15 minutes for our room to be ready when we arrived. After a an early start, an 8 hour flight and a then 75 minute journey from the airport it was a bit of a pain. However, and credit where credit is due, we were upgraded to a junior suite to compensate without asking. 2) Noise. We were at the rear on the 10th floor and the aircon fans were going 24/7 below us which gave constant noise in the room. To be fair after the first night (and tiredness set in after all the walking) we didn't notice it as much. Overall, a good hotel, which I would recommend to anyone.

<Content>Perfect for famillies We stayed on the 21st floor in a 1 bedroom suite, with our two teenage girls. Everthing was lovely, the beds were the most comfortable i have ever slept in, although the the bathroom could have been a little bigger, everthing else more than made up for it. The view from the bedroom across to the river at sunrise was fabulous and the view of the city lights from the sitting room in the evening was very special.All of the staff made us feel welcome and comfortable. We loved the club room and the free wine in the evening was always good quality. Our teenagers used the well equipped gym every day - all good reports. This was our first stay in New York and the standards of the hotel, its excellent position and genuinely warm and welcoming staff made our trip perfect.

<Content>A lovely stay at the Affinia I've never written a review before, but felt urged to after a fantastic stay at the Affinia 50. At the outset the hotel is nothing spectacular. Nice rooms, average reception area. The hotel doesn't have a dining area, more of a snug where the fine breakfast is served (at a reasonable price) Every evening in this lounge the hotel serves complementary glass of wine. Despite mine tasting more like vinegar, it seemed to encourage all the guests to gather and socialise, adding to the homely feel.Topping it off are the doormen, friendly, helpful, and always curtious to welcome home guests after an evening out. Because those who really enjoy NY, shouldn't be spending too much time in their hotel anyway!

<Content>Great service  Stayed at the Affinia 50 last Feb/March and thought it was a great hotel. I think it had recently been renovated at that stage and considering we booked in the budget price range this was a really pleasant surprise. I felt as if i was in a higher priced hotel.Whilst not much in the way of a lobby or entrance, this place has great spacious rooms (me and my friend booked into a double twin room) and is really clean. Beds were very comfortable and all the facilities in the room were perfect. I could not fault anything with the room at all.The staff on reception were incredibly helpful and provided help wherever we needed it, including letting us use the facilities of the hotel for the afternoon after we checked out and before we had to catch our flight.There is not much on the street outside, but the location is perfect, close to Rockerfeller centre and a few streets from Grand Central Station. We were never far from bars or somewhere to eat.All in all, I had a great stay in NY and this hotel was a big factor in the enjoyment of my stay. Would definately use again.

<Content>Excellent Just came back from a 5 night stay at the Affinia. We had looked at loads of hotels in New York prior to booking but having read the reviews on trip advisor we plumped for this one and we're really glad we did. Excellent location, well looked after by the staff, it was fault-less. We stayed in a guestroom which I think is the basic option. The room was on the 3rd floor, not much of a view I have to say but we weren't there during the day so it really wasn't an issue. The bed was really, really comfortable. It was great to actually stay in a hotel where you could get a good nights sleep from day one. The bathroom was alittle on the small side but certainly adequate. Hotel is about 20 minutes walk from Time Square, 15 minutes from United Nations. We walked easily enough to Grand Central Station, Radio City, Empire State Building, Broadway, Macey's, Central Park,Chrylser Building etc.Had a brilliant time in New York and would definately recommend this hotel.

The staff, from check-in to Bellman, to housekeeping were just all incredibly friendly and helpful.Will NEVER stay in any other hotel again in NYC. Do not hesitate, just GO THERE!!

<Content>Oversized room and wonderful service The Affinia is a great find in NYC. We stayed in a suite and couldn't get over how big it was. The location is central to everything. The staff is EXTREMELY accomodating even setting us up with a stretch limo (quite affordable). My teenager was thrilled to be driven around in style. The Affinia is truly a fantasic value and experience.

<Content>Great hotel Fantastic central location, easy walking distance to many attractions or there is the subway (1 min walk away) for the less energetic ! Hotel staff very friendly and helped to make our stay memorable. Great diner a few doors away for breakfast....mmm pancakes and maple syrup !! Most comfortable bed we've ever slept on, lovely room, lots of drawers and hanging space. Great shower and an abundance of fluffy towels ! Free cheese and wine most nights served in comfortable lounge and 'help yourself to coffee/tea facility'. Would stay at this hotel again without hestitation.

<Content>WOW!! first time to New York and I'll be back for more We booked our trip based on recommendations and we were not disappointed.In fact my husband said I couldn't have picked a better place! The location was fantastic.Walking distance to many attractions and convenient to stores,subway etc.The bellman was helpful in getting cabs so it was very easy to get where you were going. We enjoyed the huge room and amentities. The only thing I didn't understand for a hotel of this quality was making us pay for internet service in the lounge.(we needed to check some email) At other places we've been it has been free.Add to the fact that it seemed to be a slow dial up service that was our only disappointment in Affinia 50.Otherwise an excellent choice for new York.

<Content>Wait till you get to the room This is a very good hotel for the price we payed. (less than 拢100 a night in Midtown)The lobby is small and unassuming, and the doormen very polite and helpful. But the best part is when you get to your room, which is massive for NYC. Includes a minibar as well as other little bits and pieces including souvenirs.Location is just OK as its down on 3rd, but with Taxi`s so cheap and a subway stop 2 blocks away its no big deal.Definately a good place to stay in midtown for the price.

It is a small boutique hotel in a great location and I would recommend and return. Note - the wireless connection did not work well.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Nice Front Desk, Huge Room, bad Dining facility Loved everything about this hotel EXCEPT the breakfast room.It was a lounge, better suited for cocktails, with couches and chairs. There were no proper eating tables and we had to sit with our plates balanced on our laps or on tiny little side tables. Why can't they provide a real dining area like other hotels?

<Content>Fantastic stay at the Affinia 50 We stayed at the Affinia 50 December 22-29, 2007. Could not have been happier. The room (a one bedroom suite) was spacious and very comfortable for a family of four - including 2 teenagers. The front desk and doormen were extremely helpful. We especially enjoyed the club floor with the complimentary drinks between 6 and 7pm. We met some fellow travellers and were able to share experiences and ideas - a great idea! Location was also fantastic - you could walk to the Rockerfeller Centre, Grand Central Station and Times Square. We would definitely reccommend it and would stay there or at another Affinia hotel in future.

<Content>New York's Finest My family and I stayed at the Affinia 50 for 5 nights prior to Christmas. The hotel was chosen mainly as a result of the reviews on tripadvisor.com and as such, we were very hopeful that it would live up to the lofty reviews, particularly given that we were travelling half way around the world and looking forward to a great New York experience.The Affinia 50 was brilliant in every respect. The staff were the best we encountered in any hotel that we stayed in (USA and Europe) and in an unobtrusive and sincere way made you feel as though you were home (we loved the Welcome Home greeting from the doormen - Sammy in particular was great). The apartment was large and spotlessly clean, the bed was the most comfortable that I have slept in and the pillows were wonderful.Location wise, it is perfect. Times Square, the shops on 5th Ave, Rockefeller, Central Park etc are easily walkable, there is a subway stop on the block and the hop on/hop off bus stop is less than a block away at the Waldorf Astoria.We had a wonderful 5 days in New York and the Affinia 50 played a big part in that. Will we be going back? Absolutely!!

<Content>Simply the best choice in New York City... We have stayed at the Affinia 50 many times over the past few years and there has never been anything that was not perfect. The location is great, front desk and door people so polite and attentive...you actually feel like you are coming home. Rooms very large, clean and even a choice of pillow is a nice touch. They offer many specials online and the rates are really good . Rooms are quiet, actually has heat in winter that you can control (not all hotels do) nice club on second floor for coffee, drinks etc. and they do serve continental breakfast for $14.95 and it is very nice. Great restaurants in area too. Especially if you have say three in a room this is an excellent choice or if you want suite type accommodations again they are really nice. I highly recommend this hotel as well as the other Affinia properties if the 50 is not available.

<Content>Adorable hotel! Great price, location and service... Highly recommend! Affinia 50 made my stay in New York an unforgettable one! They have the most comfy bed I've ever slept on, which really helps]ed me rest and get ready for my next day's sightseeing. The service was really nice (their employees are very polite), and the location great. It's easy to get around to major attractions in New York City from Affinia 50 either by train or even on foot. (United Nations, Rockefeller Center and MoMA are just a couple of blocks away.) Last but not least, they have reasonable prices which I can afford. Such a nice hotel is next to impossible to find in a city like New York. Don't miss it out!

<Content>Perfect location, perfect hotel! My new fiance and I (as of the weekend of our stay!) stayed at this hotel January 4-7, and could not have asked for a better hotel. The bed was GREAT, and the amount of space is huge! We were only on the third floor, but the street noise was not a bother. Previous reviews noted needing a higher floor, so I was a bit weary when we were in a room on such a low floor, but there was not problem. The bathroom was spacious and the Aveda products were a nice touch. Cheers! (as they always say)

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised! My family of four stayed for a three days. We had a terrific experience. Our room was very large. It had a kitchen and a GREAT bath/shower, plenty of closets (!) and very good beds. The staff was really helpful, but not overly sweet -- just efficient. I loved the little things, such as a boat-load of good quality wooden hangers! There was some traffic noise on the 3rd Avenue side, but nothing that kept us up. The cleaning crew did a good job, although I found a half-eaten cookie under a bed that wasn't ours... no big deal. One things that wasn't so swell was the room-service food. We only ordered once, and that was enough! Overall I would recommend this hotel highly, and we'll be staying there again.

<Content>Terrible front desk service This one star rating is directly related to service. Front desk personnel is at best condescending; and at their worst, insulting. I was blind sided by their misery because I visited another Affinia property last fall (on 34th st )and had no problems at all. I reserved a one bedroom suite at both.One example: The suite has a kitchen. We needed extra flatware. When the flatware was requested, I was given a lecture by front desk clerk Carmel O'Conner on how she doesn't tolerate parties in the rooms. When I told her that I was an adult and fully aware of proper conduct, she proceeded to tell me about her past experiences and then repeated that she didn't want to hear any complaints from my neighbors. When I told her that I was insulted, she continued to chastise me. The flatware was delivered 4 hours later. I had already walked to the store and had purchased plastic ware.Two of us occupied this one bedroom suite (three beds and seating for aproximately ten). I am a middle aged woman with no history of raucous behavior (smile). She made a lot of assumptions and put a damper on a fun day. I got no satisfaction from the person who identified himself as the manager. When I called Don Frazier at their corporate office, he didn't even bother to call back. There were several other instances of snottiness and neglect. i.e. I pulled up in a cab, requested a bellman and went back outside to stand with my bags. They forgot all about me. The cab driver was gone, so I couldn't leave the bags. Finally a nice passer by went in an reminded them.One exception is their doorman, Rome. While I waited several hours for my room to be ready, he came and brought reading material and maps. I noticed that he was kind and helpful to everyone who came through the doors.Regarding the rooms. They are standard 3 star, no disappointment there. The bathrooms are very small, carpeting, etc. has seen better days. For the price, you wouldn't be disappointed.However, if you think that you may have to communicate with anyone at the front desk...pick another hotel.

<Content>Wow - what a great weekend! We just returned from a great weekend stay @ Affinia 50 Hotel. The hotel is great, has every amenity you can think of (Aveda Products, great plush robes, fully stocked kitchenette, etc..) and the staff is superb. They greeted us, either entering/departing the hotel, by name and with a smile! It's in a great location, Midtown East - Our room was very clean, our beds were, oh so comfy and in the morning we had coffee on our own private balcony!! We have definitely found our home away from home, when visiting New York!

<Content>Best Experience Stayed two nights at the Affinia 50 with my daughter for a weekend getaway. We did not have the suites, just a room, but it was beautifully appointed, and spacious enough. The staff at the Affinia 50 made everything work so easily and quickly. When we arrived, we sat down with the fabulous concierge to take care of a few details we had not finalized -- some restaurant reservations, checking on some tickets, etc. Every time we walked into the hotel, we were greeted warmly and any needs we had were immediately addressed. A very relaxing and welcoming experience. We will definitely stay there again!!!

<Content>Spacious, Comfortable and Great Value! We booked about a week before our stay via the hotel website and found a good deal for Affinia 50. Our original plans had changed and we needed a spacious place for 9 nights for 3 people. The booking was very quick and easy.Check-in: Excellent - quick check-in, and staff were very welcoming. We had requested a high floor when we booked and we got the 21st floor so we were delighted.Location:Great location in a nice area. Good walking distance to all the shops, Central Park. Transport links available for subway close by, buses or cabs.Concierge:Great service, very helpful. Good recommendations for dining in and out.Room accommodation:We stayed in a deluxe suite on 21st floor. Fantastic view of the river and surrounding area. Facing the east, we really enjoyed the early morning sun coming through our windows. Also very spacious for a longer stay.The beds were very comfortable and firm. We loved trying the different pillows. There was no turn down service.Bathroom is an average size. The hairdryer was good. The aveda amenities were good. Unfortunately there were no cotton buds or cooton wool. The bathroom was located through the bedroom so was a little awkward.As we stayed for nine nights we were disappointed that housekeeping failed to re-stock our aveda bathroom items on some days.Unfortunately, the cleaning wasn't as good as it should have been. When we arrived there were wrappers on the floor and plastic bags under the bed. When we pulled out the sofabed in the living room there was an old bottle and fruit core.Room temperature controls were good. Also had the option to open the windows throughout the suite which was handy.Kitchen:This was great - we could stock juices and food in the fridge. We had our own breakfast each day. We cooked a little and went out for meals a lot. There are supermarkets like Food Emporium nearby - ask the hotel for directions. Also, we ordered in on some nights and used our own dishes and cutlery. The dishwasher was so handy. Breakfast isn't included in the rate so at over $14pp it's pricey. We did get complimentary breakfast vouchers for all of us for one morning and found there was a nice selection of fruits, cereal, bagels, pastries etc.Balcony:Wonderful - we could see all the way across to the river, down 3rd avenue. Very refreshing, even in winter.2nd floor facilities:Decent gym, never crowded when we visited. Decor in the sitting room is trendy, comfortable and clean. The coffee and tea is quite basic compared to other hotels which offer complimentary refreshments. There are no pastries, biscuits or fruit. Also no complimentary bottled water.Staff were friendly and helpful. We were particularly pleased with the level of servive throughout our stay. Everyone made us feel so welcome and when we were leaving, did their best to accommodate storing our bags, organising a car and a smooth check-out.

<Content>Great Location, Great Hotel We stayed in the Affinia 50 for 4 nights in Jan. We were looking for a good size room and we certainly got that. We booked a studio suite, which had a little kitchenette, which was very convenient. Would definitely recommend the Affinia, the staff were very helpful and the location is excellent.

<Content>Great experience I stayed at Affinia 50 for 4 days in January. I don't think I have ever stayed in a hotel where the staff were as welcoming and as helpful as they were at Affinia 50. Although the ground floor lobby is not that impressive, the second floor club room more than makes up for this. My huge one bedroom suite was beautifully furnished. The bed was super comfortable and my room was quiet. The hotel is well-located for everything I wanted to do in Manhattan. Highly recommended.

<Content>Fantastic Location - An apartment in New York City! My husband and I stayed in the Affinia 50 from January 2nd to January 7th 2008. When we arrived we were greated with a winderful welcome home from the lovely doorman (the first of all of the great doormen who work at the hotel) which was very welcome after a hard days travelling. Check in was fast and efficient and the room was wonderful. We stayed in a one bedroomed king sized suite. The lounge was huge with a comfortable sofa bed which we could have friends to stay in free of charge and a good sized table/dining area. The king sized bed was huge and one of the most comfortable that we have ever slept in. The bathroom was spotlessly clean as was the extremely useful kitchen. The hotel provides a free wine and cheese reception Monday to Thursday. This is an excellent was of unwinding after a hard days shopping or sightseeing and also a great opportunity to meet some of the other travellers in the hotel. We met some lovely people there and have a number of very convivial evenings! The staff who run the wine and cheese are great and kept the wine flowing. The concierge is usually available near the club room and was a great help. He recommended a mexican restaurant called Zarela just around the corner and we had a lovely evening there in a very atmospheric restaurant. One of the other concierges was even able to get us tickets for Wicked!The cleaning staff were absolutely lovely and cleaned the apartment to an extremely high standard. They even wash any dishes left in the sink!The hotel is in an excellent location. We did not even have to buy subway tickets until the second last day as were were going down to Century 21. We walked to St Patrick's Cathedral and Central Park, Macys and the Waldorf Astoria is just around the corner. We have stayed at the Affinia Dumont one one of our previous trips and it was fantastic but the location of the Affinia 50 is much better. We intend to return in the Summer and take our four children with us as it is exactly the same as having your very own apartment in the New York City!

<Content>location location location Location really is everything here, New to New York, we just took a chance on what seemed like a good spot to base shopping and sightseeing. This is pretty perfect. It's 5 minutes from the nicest part of 5th Ave, 1 minute from a well linked in Metro stop and you step out and see the Crysler building within seconds - on a beautiful winter morning with clear blue skies and gorgeous light that's a pretty great start to the day!Finding the hotel is easy so long as you have the address with you. Fixed price cab ($49) from the JFK made a late arrival easy. It's not huge - and doesn't have a large entrance like the Marriott or Waldorf just close by, but it does have really helpful friendly staff. Their recommendation for local sushi was spot on -tiny restaurant we would never have found without them. Great quality compared to our UK versions (although not a patch on the real thing in Japan still). Red Stone pizzeria, (head south on Lexington) did the best breakfast bagels etc we found). The room seemed a decent size compared to our expectations of New York. Average decor, could do with a little TLC in places, but the basics are great - comfy bed and clean room. Quiet. Nice big mirror for trying on all those new clothes!Tourist-wise it's easy to get about as mentioned above. Do try to book tickets to the Federal Reserve bank if you've got time. They have to be sent to your home address). It's a really different experience.

<Content>Great for Families! I recently enjoyed a 10 night stay at this property with my husband, 17yo daughter and 14 yo old son. It was our first trip to New York from Australia. Firstly, the location is absolutely first rate. The lobby is small but friendly and welcoming (the pleasant, subtle scent of an uplifting essential oil continued throughout our 10 day stay). The decor of the elevators and hallways is a little tired and dated. However, our spacious room (junior suite with 2 queen beds, loungeroom, kitchenette, balcony and bathroom) was very well presented, clean and COMFORTABLE. The small bathroom was modern and very clean. The kitchenette was more than adequate for our needs. The beds were very comfortable. The 24 hour Guest Lounge on the 2nd Floor is very welcoming and nicely presented. It's a lovely place to enjoy breakfast, meet friends or read the paper.The greatest asset of the Affinia 50 is its staff. Every staff member we encountered were warm, friendly and attentive. They really did enhance the overall feeling of welcome and comfort during our stay. This alone makes this property stand out from many others. Whilst I'm used to staying at more luxurious looking properties, the Affinia 50 met all our needs and was an excellent choice for our family vacation. In this very expensive city, it is a fantastic option for families or groups and those who appreciate the feeling of a friendly, comfortable home away from home.

<Content>The Afinia 50 was Excellent Value We found the Affinia50 through Trip Advisor and made reservations for a two-night stay January 1-3 2008. We were very pleased with the hotel. Its location is excellent and the staff was very friendly. Minor problems such as a burned-out light were taken care of quickly. The next time we visit New York, we'll check out availability and rates for this hotel first.

<Content>Again, we loved it We've stayed at the Affinia 50 three times. The one bedroom suties are terrific and spacious, with attractive furnishings. If one person wants to stay up late and another doesn't, it's perfect. The kitchen facilities make it great to toast a delicious NY bagel in the morning, make coffee and head out. Stephan, who is at the front desk, is very helpful, as is all the staff.

<Content>5 stars for Affinia 50 We booked this hotel after reading great reviews about it and we were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome (although we had a little trouble checking in) and all staff were extremley friendly especially Manny the doorman, who helped us alot throughout the stay.The hotel itself is considered small, but dont let that fool you as our room was huge and we had the most comfortbale bed which is great after a long day walking. The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance of some of the attractions including Central Park, Rockefeller Centre, Times Square and Fifth Ave. Also it is near a subway which was extremley useful.Overall we give this hotel 5 star rating, as the the staff were friendly, rooms were cleaned every day and because of the great location. If you pick this hotel to stay in you wont be disappointed.

<Content>Excellent hotel We stayed at the Affinia 50 for one week during our honeymoon, in mid December. This is an excellent hotel, the location (3rd Av/ 50th St) is perfect, the room was huge (not the bathroom, a little on the smallside) and clean, the staff was very helpful and polite, specially Sid,the concierge, who had plenty of good suggestions for us. The 鈥渟ocial鈥?room on the second floor is very nice, in the evenings they offer wine and cheese, which was really enjoyable in front of the fireplace after a day of walking around in the cold!As far as we understand, prices can change a lot depending on season, offers etc, however, based on the long and meticulous search we performed before booking, we can say that this hotel is reasonably priced (thou, this is indeed midtown Manhattan, so you cannot really compare it with any other place in the World price-wise!). We enjoyed our stay at the Affinia 50 and would return to this hotel.

<Content>Couldn't have asked for a nicer stay! Before booking our hotel stay, I read review after review about how wonderful the Affinia 50 was. I decided to book a 10 day stay and I am so pleased that I did. I really couldn't have asked for a nicer stay! The staff was friendly (Steven was great) and the bellhop and doormen were super nice. They also gave great suggestions to local restaurants in the area. The lobby was small but nicely decorated for Christmas. The room was beautiful and quite spacious for a New York room. We had a balcony that overlooked 3rd Avenue. What a nice touch!! We also received a complimentary bottle of champagne that made us feel very welcome. The room amenities were great and the bathroom was stocked with everything we needed. It felt modern and was very clean. I would definitely return to the Affinia 50. Rockefeller Center, Central Park, and many other highlights are right around the corner or within walking distance. Subway locations are not far either. For the price and service, the Affinia 50 is the place to stay!

<Content>Affinia 50 is a home from home have just returned fro staying at the Affinia 50 with my daughter. We went to New York to celebrate her 21st birthday. The lobby is only small and we wondered what to expect, but our room on the 17th floor was extremely spacious. We had a large living room,dining area and a kitchen complete with dishwasher(not that we used it).The bathroom is small but compact and there was plenty of storage space. Clubroom on the 2nd floor is very welcoming.We stayed in total for 4 nights and packed so much into each day that coming back to such a comfortable room was a real bonus. Once you get your bearings you realize how well placed this hotel really is.Try the Gramercy Tavern for some brilliant food.(a taxi ride away) The real bonus in this hotel are the staff they are all without exception so friendly and helpful. We had problems on our last day as the shuttle service did not turn up to take us to the airport. Manny, the concierge, sorted it all out and we ended up with a complimentary chauffeur driven car to the airport. Would certainly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Personnel! : ) We arrived at the Affinia 50 before check in time but we checked in anyway. The very nice man asked if we had ever been to NY City. I let him know that it was my boyfriend's first time. He was very nice, welcomed us and took our cell phone number. He let us know that he would call us when a room was ready. We had our bags so we checked them and walked around the city. When the front desk called to let us know our room was ready, they also said they had done something special for us since it was my boyfriend's first time in the city. When we arrived to a very friendly staff, they gave us keys to a suite. They had upgraded us free of charge. We had our bags delivered by a very friendly bell man. We had such a great room. The bed was a king and the room was spacious, especially for a New York City hotel room. It was very clean and we enjoyed it very much. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I would definitely return to stay and recommend this hotel to other : )

<Content>Great location, great staff Stayed here for 5 nights with my daughter. It was our first time in New York. Staff were great, from checking in to us checking out, and very helpful with directions to places of interest, which shows were still on (we were there when the stage hands were on strike). Room was spacious for city hotel, very clean and super beds.Hotel was perfectly placed to visit main shopping areas and sites such as Rockerfeller centre, 5th Avenue etc. There are a couple of delis, restaurant and diner within a few yards of the hotel which gave you a great choice of eating when returning from a long day's sightseeing or shopping.Would definitely recommend and would certainly choose this hotel again.

<Content>Top marks to Affinia 50 Have just returned from a fantastic five day trip to New York with my brother.Although we loved everything about the experience, Affinia 50 has to take some of the credit for making our visit so memorableOur room was clean and specious and the beds were incredibly comfortable.The bathroom was small but very clean and modern and the staff were always very friendly and helpful.In terms of location, Affinia 50 is well situtated just a few blocks from major attractions such as Grand Central Station and the main shopping areas. The nearest subway is just around the corner and there's a selection of bars, diners and restaurants to suit all tatses and pockets juts a short walk from the hotel.All in all Affinia 50 offers excellent value for money and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone looking for a friendly, reasonably priced hotel near to all the actionI'll definitely stay there again

<Content>Fantastic!!! Couldnt fault it even if i tried! stayed at the Affinia 50 for 4 nights from 15-19th November. Stayed in room 1108 - and was a fantastic room. Lovely sized rooms and the pillow service was excellent!! didnt find the bathroom too small as others have mentioned, and the kitchen came in very handy! Room had a good view out onto the street and the air con was perfect. Got a bit hot sometimes, mainly after using the hairdryer (which was supplied!) but we just opened a window for a bit and it was fine. Subway was only 2 minute walk away and hotel central to all the main sites, times square, rockefellar etc which was only about 5-10 minute walk away. Staff were very friendly and helpful, always smiling. Overall us 3 girls felt perfectly safe in New York and had a fab time! am looking at booking again and wouldnt have to think twice about using the Affinia 50!

<Content>Affinia 50, perfect for shopping and sightseeing Have just returned from a 4 day stay. Fantastic hotel, the concierge Tanya went out of her way to ensure we got the best from our stay, so much so that in 3 days we did the helicopter tour, went up the Empire State, did the horse and carriage through Central Park, visited Grand Central Station, Tiffany's Macy's Bloomindales, all the shops on 5th Avenue, 3 restaurants and had a limo ride as well! 4 of us stayed in a 1 bed suite, which was clean, spacious and had great views. There was complimentary cheese and wine, coffee and tea and Tanya even sent wine to our room one evening while we were getting ready to go out. The location is central for all the main attractions. We chose to travel by taxi as opposed to using the bus or underground, the most we paid was $20 to get to the ferry for the Statue of Liberty.Would definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>We loved the Affinia 50! I went with my two daughters for a 5 night stay at the Affinia 50 and we will go back for sure. Have already recommended to several friends. The location could not have been better, it was reasonably clean and the staff were superb! I would have prefered a quiter room, but the noise level was not unmanageable. Close to underground, very central, food shops, cafes and excellent restaurants, don't miss Nada sushi, really excellent.

<Content>OK but not the 8th best hotel in NYC! We've just returned from a four day stay in the Affina 50 in New York. We chose it because it was rated as the 8th best hotel in New York on trip advisor which we've always found to be a great bench mark. However, whilst the hotel was OK we were disappointed with some aspects of our stay. In general the staff were helpful and the room was of a decent size and the bed was lovely and comfortable but the noise level from the street was so loud it regularly woke us up. The bathroom had definitely seen better days and was pokey. Our sink plug didn't work properly and when we pulled it out to let water down it was then removed by housekeeping for a couple of days leaving us with no plug at all. Our door lock didn't work and we kept being locked out which was very frustrating. The alarm clock in the room had been set to 4am so woke us up at that time on the first day (no fun when you鈥檝e just managed to get to sleep with jetlag!) Housekeeping was erratic, sometime great, sometimes terrible; we came back to our room one day when the maid was still cleaning and found that she had put all of the dirty linen on top of our open suitcase, crushing the contents. The bedding itself left something to be desired; the sheets were too small for the bed so ended up in a crumpled heap after a couple of hours in bed, leaving us just with an uncovered duvet on top of us, an experience that I am sure was shared by the guest before us and the one before them etc 鈥?essentially meaning that we all shared the same bedding! The aircon was definitely aged and the room was generally too hot or too cold. There is also no bar in the hotel at all, so we ended up at The Benjamin up the road for a quiet drink and on reflection would have preferred to be there for the duration of our stay (even though it only rated #23!)

<Content>We love the Affinia 50! We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Affinia 50 and have to agree with all the previous positive comments. We did a LOT of research before booking this hotel and relied heavily on reviews from Trip advisor users. Once we had made up our minds that the Affinia 50 was the hotel for us we couldn't wait to get there.After a nervous 24 hours when Airmiles told us that despite having a confirmation email the hotel was fully booked and offered us several very poor alternatives, we finally got our confirmation (again) that we had a 1 bedroom suite.We arrived late at night and from check in to check out everyone was very attentive. The suite was gorgeous, very big, with full kitchen (not that we cooked anything but handy for making drinks etc!) and a large lounge/dining room. The sofa bed had been made up ready for us on arrival. The bedroom was plenty big enough for two double beds and all our cases and shopping bags - which increased with every day of the holiday!The beds are very comfortable with lovely bedding and made up beautifully every day by the Housekeepers. The room was spotless and the hotel's location is perfect for walking everywhere. Last year we stayed in Battery Park area and had to catch a subway everywhere - this was so much easier and great for dropping off shopping bags and then carrying on again!!Overall we would definitely recommend the Affinia 50 and are already talking about rebooking for our visit next year - book this hotel and you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Great Bithday trip Originally reserved a 1 BR suite with 2 queens for 11/9-11/11 to celebrate my mother's birthday, but upon checking in we were told the 1BR suite they had for us was 1 bed only with a sleeper sofa. They were completely sold out for the night so showed us a guest room on the second floor with 2 queens, and that ended up just fine- plus it was right across from the Club room, which could have served as our living room, had we needed one. The only problem was the second we walked in the room, Lenny (he was the best!) offered to get us a fan; it was evident the heater was broken and on full blast. We ventured out in the rain to Smith and Wollensky (again, great suggestion form Lenny), had a great dinner and got back to our room- the fan had been delivered. It was a box fan so we put it up on an end table and left it on full blast all night and slept like babies- I have to say their beds are the BEST- so good that we slept until 10:30 Saturday morning! We heard NO traffic noise but our room didn't face the street.This hotel is in the BEST location- everything we wanted was within walking distance (we didn't want to go to Times Square or, Broadway.)My biggest disappointment was the complete lack of service at the door Friday night and Saturday. Once we struggled in the door ourselves with our luggage - no doorman, with or without a hat. Likewise for Saturday, when we returned from shopping, struggling in the door by ourselves. This time the famed doorman with the fedora was there- behind the desk. I never ONCE saw him outside. Today (11/11) was a diifferent story- the doorman- a very tall gentleman, didn't catch his name was wonderful. In a city known for top service this hotel needs to be more consistent, but I am headed back to NY 1/08 and will be staying at Affinia 50 again.

<Content>Great Hotel in Manhattan! We stayed in the Jr. Suite and it was enormous (there were 3 of us). The service of the hotel was amazing. Very receptive towards us. The location was key. Only a couple of blocks from 5th avenue. Great restaraunts and a nice walk to Central Park. Also near the subway station and easy access to the hotel from the airport via the subway. The price was right on this one for sure!

<Content>What a fabulous place to stay!! Can't say enough great things about this hotel! The beds/linens were wonderful; we had a jr suite w/kitchen- it definitely was worth the extra money! Everyone there - Manny, Rome, Ralph, Tonya, Samuel, Halaina, etc. - treated us like royalty! Super clean, big rooms,Aveda products in the baths, close enough to most everything - cab fares were very reasonable if we couldn't walk there. When we plan another trip. we will definitely be back!

<Content>Avoid the Second Floor! This hotel was cute and centrally located, but I had the bad luck to get a room on the second floor directly across from the room where they keep the linens, so starting at the crack of dawn and going throughout the day I heard the constant slamming of the door. The second floor window was also directly on the street, so I had to keep the blinds closed the whole time or be on display like a zoo animal, so that made the room kind of depressing. Also, my coffeemaker didn't work and the bathtub drain was broken, it took two calls to the front desk before someone was sent up to get them fixed. Then when a guy finally came up with a new coffeemaker and a rubber drain stopper I was about to check out. Cute place though, I think I just had some bad luck.Coolest thing about the hotel: room service comes from the Indian restaurant across the street, a nice change from the usual steak-and-potato fare.

<Content>Another great visit to Affinia 50 This was our second stay at the Affinia 50 and once again it did not disapoint. The staff are wonderful, Manny on the door, remembered us from our visit last year. Nothing is too much bother for them. The only minor issue was our room, which although it was on the 4th floor, it was above some air con units which were a wee bit noisy. The club room on the 2nd floor is a great meeting place and good for a quick pre- getting ready to go out for dinner drink!!! We will definitely stay at the Affinia 50 on our next visit to New York.

<Content>Very good choice in Manhattan My wife and me stayed for nine nights at Affinia 50 and we loved this small hotel. The room was spacious if you compare with others hotel's in NYC. Distinct decor and clean bathroom. Very confortable bed. Staff was professional and attentive, mainly the housekeeping. The location is perfect if you want stay close of midtown's highlights (NY Library and Bryant Park, Grand Central Station, Times Square, Broadway's shows, Fifth Ave. shops). There are many options around the hotel to eat out, with great restaurants near. I suggest Aquavit (five blocks from hotel) and Dos Caminos - few steps from hotel, on the corner of 3rd ave. with 50 st. My singular complain is about the breakfast served at club room, not so extensive how they announce in the affinia's website. We certainly would back to Affinia 50.

<Content>Perfect Great Location, good sized rooms, friendly staff. We were surprised of the size of the room as we had heard New York rooms were boxy and were very pleased with ours. Modernly furnished, all air-con, coffee machine in room, lovely Aveda products only little moan is bathroom was a little tired looking. Staff were very friendly and doorman Manni was fantastic. He can tell you the best and quickest way to anywhere so make sure you ask him, he was fab!!  Our best restaurants were in Times Sq. Maxie's for b/fast, lunch, dinner, Bubba Gumps for fun food and great shrimp and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for the best steak in the world ever!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Happy Days A fantastic hotel/people/location. An excellent place to stay, close enough to all the highlights of manhattan but a small distance from times square to ensure a decent nights sleep. Matty and Samuel the doormen are real characters and well worth getting to know, they'll brighten up your trip whatever the weather. Only thing missing from the hotel is a bar but it gets you out into the real world a bit more. We stayed in the queen room which was great for what we needed, minibar/good shower/ nice bed etc.. You must go to Burger Heaven on East 49th st for breakfast, it's cheap as chips and will fill you for the day, can highly recommend the two egg plate with bacon. Will definately stay here again on our next trip.

<Content>Great hotel Just got back from a 4 night stay at this hotel, which I thoroughly recommend. The room was lovely, really big and with added extras such as free aveda toiletries, a well-stocked mini bar and a pillow menu, so you can choose the pillow that suits you and your needs best! And the club room on the 2nd floor is well worth taking advantage of, with big comfy leather sofas, a huge TV and free tea, coffee and water at all times and best of all - free wine and cheese Monday-Thursday between 6pm and 7pm! The staff were also great, really friendly and helpful. The location is good, between third and Lex with a subway station within a block and Grand Central a short walk away, and it is within walking distance to some great bars and restaurants all down second and third avenues. I would stay here again.

<Content>Great Service...Will Return. My husband and I were thoroughly impressed with the service at this hotel. It was so much better than at a larger chain. Tonya the concierge and the young women at the front desk ( I' can't rember her name but she wore glasses) were both so professional and helpful. We travel to NYC at least once a year and lived in the city for a couple years and feel that this is a great location away from the noise of Time Square. There are tons of great restaurants nearby as well as Ess-A-Bagel ( we miss good bagels)Next time we return for pleasure this will definitely be at the top of our list of places to stay.

<Content>Loved the Affinia 50! We just returned from a Saturday night stay at the Affinia 50. We were celebrating my Mother's 70th birthday and booked a suite for four ladies. I contacted the hotel about a month in advance and told them about the special birthday. They upgraded us to a two bedroom corner suite on the 16th floor. It was very spacious and the view from the balcony was beautiful!I had read the other trip advisor reviews before traveling, so we weren't surprised by the splashy sinks but that was just a minor point given the large living area and dining space.The club level was helpful for us because we had different folks arriving at different time so that the early arrivals could freshen up and head out to Bloomindale's (with discount coupons from the front desk!). For breakfast the next morning, we took the advice of other posters and went to Essa Bagel. We got a nova platter and three extra bagels and had a nice feast for four back in our suite after stopping in the club room for coffee and tea on the way back up.There happened to be a street fair on Lexington on Sunday so after we checked out, we left our bags at the front desk and went off bargain hunting. Overall, it was a wonderful stay!

<Content>Great Hotel with a Great Location My sister and I just returned from a cruise where we had a 3 night pre cruise stay at the Afiinia 50. We enjoyed our stay here. It was a very nice hotel. We had a 2 bed studio on the 12th floor. Didn't have any problems with noise from the street or any rooms next door. We had two very comfortable beds in a large room. More room than other New York hotels we have stayed in. Our room had a small kitchen that had a stove(that we didn't use), a microwave and a full size refrigerator. Nice to keep drinks in and a few breakfast items. The bathroom was small but I didn't think it was too small. Great Aveda products supplied. Hotel staff also greeted us upon leaving the elevators in the lobby and the doorman always welcomed us home upon our arrival back to the hotel. Nice touch. The hotel was in a good location. We liked being out of the chaos of Times Square but it was close enough to walk to Rockefeller Center and Times Square. We felt safe walking back to this hotel at night. Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Location, great room, loved it !!!!!!! We have just returned from a 4 day break to NY from London. Well what can I say we have a standard double room with the biggest bed I have ever slept in we was on the 3rd floor and my initial reaction was that the noise was going to be intolerable. I never heard a thing!The room was a great size for the two of us bigger than some rooms I have had on previous holiday abroad. It had a big TV and plenty of space for all the shopping bags!. Bathroom was a bit on the small size but the shower and bath etc was clean with fresh towels each day. (what more do you need)The hotel is between 3rd and Lexington and five block walk to the Rockefeller centre a great location with not to much hassle and bustle as if you were staying in time square.I would highly recommend this hotel and would go back for sure.

<Content>Great for 4 folks! We were in NY with our 2 teenage daughters for Labor Day weekend and couldn't have picked a better hotel! Because our flight was delayed and we arrived at the hotel close to midnight, they had run out of rooms with 2 double beds... No problem - They upgraded us to a 2 room suite! Aside from that obvious perk, the hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We already had our theater tix but the concierge was able to recommend a terrific restaurant nearby. Would definitely stay here again and it was a BARGAIN relative to other NY hotels with 2 beds!

<Content>Great Experience I stayed here one night with a friend. I booked a 2 bed room. We were upgraded without asking to a 2 bed suite which included a little kitchen. The room was huge, clean, and luxurious. The bed was fantastic--we took advantage of the pillow menu. The service was superb. We didn't notice any street noise (we were on the 7th floor). The Aveda toiletries were great. The bathroom was spacious and very modern. I would definitely stay here again. It's a nice modern hotel. The suite we had would easily and comfortably accomodate a family of 4.

<Content>Not really worth it We paid around $350 a night for a suite at the Affinia 50 at a discounted price. The value we got was far inferior to this price even if it's not a bad hotel per-se. In a city like New York there are far better options available.We arrived there late night to find an indifferent check-in and a very large room completely unpopulated of furniture. The problems began rapidly: some of the parcels we had been expected were not there. I had contacted the hotel previously to request my parcels to be held. I assumed they were delayed.Once in the room, we found we had no hot water AND that the toilet was leaking water quite badly. We were so tired we just fixed it with a hanger - the Mexican way - until the next day. Not impressive.The next morning my girlfriend had a really important interview and the hot water wasn't coming. In the end it magically appeared, despite the front desk ignoring us. The toilet was fixed almost 24 hours after reporting it.The rooms do look a bit like the pictures, in a style I personally found quite disagreeable. Objectively, however, once inside the lobby you felt the place was a dump. We didn't see the famous bell boys with the hat until the day we were leaving, and the ridiculously small lobby with the potted trees and the fountain are not awe-inspiring considering the price we paid. If you get a deal, however, this wouldn't be concerning.Finally, our parcels were actually RETURNED TO SENDER by the hotel staff, and despite my repeated mentioning of how angry we were at this to various members of staff, including the manager, we did not get one dollar refunded off our ridiculously high fare. We got into an enormous amount of trouble to rescue some of the ones which were rescuable.In the end we did sleep and were well situated, but I'd recommend the Parker Meridien for a higher-end option if the price is right. There's thousands of options in the Big Apple to have to go through this.

Street noise is unbearable! ...The front desk managers are incompetent, annoying and useless. Best part of stay was the morning we checked out of this place. IF IT WERE A COLOR IT WOULD BE GREY. Fortunately for us, we moved to a gem hotel and were able to begin enjoying the rest of our stay in NYC!!

<Content>Loved Everything About It Just returned back to the UK from a wonderful 4 day stay in New York, for our 25th wedding anniversary, followed by a family wedding in the White Mountains, New Hampshire. Can I just say that everything about this hotel was awesome. Had spent weeks (months) even reading reviews about different hotels in New York and decided on this one after much deliberation, but mostly because of the excellent reviews. Our room was amazing on the 18th floor. It was a suite with a balcony off the lounge and bedroom. We took our 3 daughters with us and they were stunned by the views. Yes, it was noisy, but it was New York, and we decided that everywhere in New York had to be noisy cos the traffic never stops. We were so tired each day after sightseeing that the noise did not stop us from sleeping, and just added to the excitement of being in such a wonderful city. The staff were all very polite and always eager to help, especially the guy on the door with the hat, he was amazing, just wish we knew his name. We actually did not have any problems at all during our stay, but I do agree about the sink thing. We thought the hotel was a little out of the way when looking on the map, but soon found that everything we wanted to see was within walking distance. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, and hope it helps anybody hoping to stay in New York in the future.

<Content>Well Kept Secret Perhaps I shouldn't be telling the world how good this hotel is?We have recently spent two visits at this hotel and are absolutely delighted with it. Yes, some of the lower rooms are noisy due to New York - not the hotels fault! Fire sirens, taxi's, nightclubbers etc. If you want a quiet nights sleep then book a higher room or visit the countryside!We were in a room on the 3rd floor street side where even though we expected a little hustle and bustle and our room door faced the elevator door we all slept soundly (2 adults 2 kids).This is one of the friendliest hotels we have ever stayed at. The check-in is so quick and easy and you are immediately supplied with maps and some general information on the immediate area - even without asking! This was our first trip to New York - a place where we would admit to having some reservations about the city and its inhabitants. These were immediately removed by the attitude of Affinia 50's staff.The room was very clean and comfortable, maybe not to be described as enormous for 4 people but average sized and ample for us. . The bathrooms were also a little small but had everything required and were fully functional. The beds are very comfortable. The room cleaning was very efficient and perfect every time. Each room has a coffee maker, ironing board etc. We didn't use the gym facilities that are provided but they seemed very adequate on inspection. The lifts are average - NOT small. There is no bar but there are many bars and restaurants nearby within a very short walk.The location is excellent and major attractions can be reached within minutes of the hotel. This is contrary to previous reviews for this hotel but - a 1/2 mile walk is really not far! Times Square or Central Park is about a mile away and when you take a taxi you miss all the stuff in between. Go on - give it a try.The rooms are great but the major selling point here is the friendly staff of this hotel. The minute you return from your long day of touring the city you are met with a verbal 'Welcome home' from the bell men and reception staff. They are always willing to help and are ever smiling. We took advantage of a late check out facility that was free. This gave valuable extra city time on our departure day as the normal checkout is 12 midday.The next time we return to New York we will definitely stay at this hotel.

<Content>Best NYC hotel experience ever I lived in New York for 9 years and travel back once a month for work. I've stayed in all sorts of hotels over the years but this was by far the best experience I've ever had. The service was outstanding, and the suite I was in was larger than most NYC apartments! I've paid more money and stayed in rooms not even 1/4 the size. The people were lovely and really went the extra mile. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, and l plan to book future trips based on when this hotel has availability.

<Content>Solid 3 star but not a 4 star property Just back from a stay at the Affinia 50. Overall was satisfied. On the plus side, the rooms (at least ours) are relatively spacious. Bed is comfy. Good isolation from noise, which I was not sure would be the case because we were down on the 3rd floor and close to the elevator (though not right adjacent to it). On the flip side, the room was showing some minor signs of wear. In two places the molding of the headboard was noticeably peeling away from the frame. The lone dresser was cheaply made, something you might put in a kid's room, not suspension drawers, and one of them was stuck partially opened, enough so that we just didn't use it. The bottom of the inside of the bathroom door was very badly scratched. One bulb in the bathroom light fixture burned out and remained out during our stay (3 nights). And when in the bathroom, the sound of music clearly echoed into it from some other room, could not tell if was from below (the lounge is on the 2nd floor so probably) or above. But while audible in the bathroom it was not loud enough to disturb us in the main room. I stay in Midtown East a lot, and this location is close to the Divine Wine Bar (flights of wine and tapas-like food) which I heartily recommend, Amma (great Indian food) and Dos Caminos (Mexican) which is also good. My complaints/observations are relatively minor, but they are the type of things separating 3 star and 4 star hotels. There are other hotels in the area (which I won't name, as TripAdvisor has rejected a restaurant review of mine in which I named other restaurants), some of which are a clear step up in quality and can be had for similar prices or even less when they run specials. All in all, if you book at Affinia 50 it seems a pretty safe bet you won't be disappointed, but you won't be wowed either.

<Content>Friendly and Clean This was my second trip to N.Y. I was here last year but stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square (48th  8th). Stayed here because of the reviews, thought we would try something different. We were met by friendly smiles and genuinely happy people. After getting into the elevators which are extremely small and I mean small we arrived on the 5th floor. Our room was very clean, loved that they don't use Bedspreads but fresh clean sheets, so much more sanitary. The room was an okay size, I agree with another guest that the bathroom faucet spewed way too much water therefore everything on the sink area gets wet. Towels were nice, more water pressure would have been better however it did not ruin my trip. The absolute worst thing about this hotel is the NOISE, and I mean NOISE!! You hear absolutely everything and sirens and traffic are a constant, you felt like your room was outside. I found the location to be okay however I much more enjoyed my previous N.Y. visit's location at the Hilton as it was a much shorter walk to various places and the Affinia is further to places such as Times Square. I would recommend this hotel for the staff as they are very friendly and maid service was excellent, okay beds, I prefer a little firmer but it was alright but if you need something a little more quiet than you must go elsewhere. I am not kidding when I say this is a Noisy Hotel, and yes you are in it for sleep only but it is a little hard with all the traffic which is endless as it is on a very busy corner.

<Content>Great place to stay We recently stayed at the Affinia 50 in NYC. After much research and planning for this first time trip to NYC, I was very satisfied with the choice I made in this hotel. I brought my 2 daughters, future daughter-in-law, and niece with me for a 5 night stay.  The jr. suite we had was huge. The queen beds were just as comfortable as my own at home, and there were no complaints about the sofa-sleeper.  The hotel staff was very friendly from the doormen to the housekeeper to the front desk staff.  I would say that the only complaints I have is that anytime you turned the water on in the bathroom sink to wash your face, brush teeth, etc. the counter would get all wet. I'm not sure if it was due to the sink being too small or the facet being too long  high, perhaps both. I was a little disappointed in the view we had from our window...a brick wall from the building next door. After seeing on tripadvisor that some rooms had beautiful views of the Empire State Building, that would have been really nice. But it was okay because we really didn't spend much time in our room anyway. I would definitely stay here again. Hopefully, I can talk my husband into making the trip next time.

<Content>Just keeps getting better!!! My extensive traveling brings me to New York city numerous times a year and my hotel of choice is the exceptionally comfortable, clean,convenient midtown location and accomodating hotel AFFINIA 50! I am at present at the hotel since a minor ailment,forced an extended stay,which the staff quickly and seamlessly arranged. While working, I decide to browse some reviews and was surprised and appalled by some of the comments and immediately decided to write my own review.For over 4 years, I habitually stayed at one of the GRAND DAME hotels in midtown about a block from the Affinia. The service and rooms ranged from poor to superlative with ever escalating rates. On a whim, I stopped at the Affinia and asked directions from TANIA the concierge. She was professional, informative and fun and invited me to make my next stay here. Lucky day for me! The rooms are lovely (I have been in 4)and large . 15-20 minutes is the standard timeframe for issue resolutions including plumbing, kitchen appliances, bedding etc. ALL OF THE STAFF, bellmen, housekeeping, concierge, front desk are professional and genuinely caring with strong and efficient manager(s) like Sandra. They never fail to acknowledge you by name, remember any special requests or issues (food allergies) even surprising me on my birthday with special treatment - SOMETHING NEVER DONE BY THE OTHER HOTEL WHERE I SPENT MUCH TIME AND MONEY$$. I recommend this hotel to everyone travelling to New York and have brought friends and family members to stay!!!!!P.S. KUDOS on the addition of the mini-bar service.

<Content>TA Scores Again Our family (two adults and two teen agers) were steered to this hotel by other TA reviews and, as usual, were not disappointed. The room was large; for New York, very large. The decor was stylish and attractive. The beds were very comfortable and luxurious. We had plenty of closet space, the bathroom was great and first class. Really a nice and comfortable space.The hotel staff was way beyond what I expect in terms of service. Unlike many, I find New Yorkers friendly and helpful as a lot, but the staff here was as helpful and attentive and fun as any I have ever experienced (and that is a large database). The common spaces were somewhat tight, but typical for Manhattan. The exercise room had everything I needed..good, but not the best. The location was good for us...just on the edge of the busiest part of Midtown east...a short walk to either MOMA, theaters or the delightful residential neighborhoods near the East River. If I had to pick on something, it would be that the kitchen was a little downscale from the rest of the room. Given that we received a free upgrade to a room with a kitchen, I can't complain. And it was fine, but just a little on the cheap side relative to the rest of the room and hotel.We paid about $300 per night in high season for the four of us...not too much by Manhattan standards. In short, unless you are going budget with price as the necessary and primary concern, this is a great hotel and a great value.

<Content>Affinia 50, exellent hotel in New York City We stayed in the Affinia, on the corner of 3rd Ave and 50th street in August, 2007 for 3 days. We booked a Studio Room , which had a total footprint of 322 sq.ft. It included a bathroom, kitchen and bedroom area. The double bed, room area proper, measured 180 sq.ft. Very generous room lay-out.The kitchen had a stove, refrigerator, microwave and coffee-maker. There was Internet access in the room, as well as a business center with 2 computers. The lobby was very small, but one can hang comfortably in the club room on the 2nd floor. The complementary wine, cheese and crackers every day at 6:00 PM was a nice touch. However, there is no restaurant or other recreational facilities. The place is perfect for business travelers who need a place to stay for a number of days, prepare of warm simple dishes in the evening. There are plenty of places nearby to eat or snack. One restaurant that we can recommend is the Peking Duck Restaurant on 52nd street, btw. 2nd and Third Ave. Also an Malaysian restaurant, Nyonya in China Town. All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much. RAv9092001

<Content>NY, NY Big City of Dreams!!! I just returned from a 5 day stay at the Affinia 50 in NY City and I loved it!! The rooms are very contemporary and very clean. The location is perfect - close to restaurants, grocery store, Mcdonalds, Time Square, Shopping, Sightseeing, etc -- you can't go wrong staying here. The hotel itself was nice, the staff was great (especially Lenny and Rome -- very sweet and polite gentlemen). The hotel also has a club room which looks like two large living rooms. They are very comfortable and a nice place to relax if you have to check out before leaving to the airport or wait before you are able to check in to your room. The only bad thing was our room did not face the street. Our view was obstructed by another building and right below our room seemed to be the air conditioning unit for the building. It was very loud ALL day and ALL night long (FYI we stayed in Rm #503). Regardless we enjoyed our stay and would definitely return to the Affinia 50 next time we visit NY.

<Content>Affinia 50 Again! I reserved 2 jr. suites for my family, on our first trip to NYC ever. We stayed Aug 1st thru 4th. Although I have never been to Manhattan, I have heard the stories of the very overpriced and small, poorly maintained hotels. The Affinia 50 was excellent. We have enjoyed our stay very much, and will return if we make it back to NYC. I had with my a 23, 21, 18 and 17 year old-- my children and a friend. The older children (boys) were in one room, and my wife and daughter and I were in the other. We have all be very pleased. The rooms are good size, and are very clean. Everything is close that we had planned, so it worked out very well. Thank you Affinia 50!--Note: Recommend the 3 hr harbor cruise!

<Content>Welcome home! The Affinia 50 is a truly wonderful place to stay. The rooms are extremely clean and spacious, esp by NY standards. The beds are so comfortable as are the pillows-I loved the pillows that were on my bed, so didn't make use of the much mentioned pillow concierge although I have to admit that paritally sold me-good marketing! There is plenty of closet space, two full length mirrors and a small fridge. The bathroom had enough shelf space. Real hairdryer, and an iron/full ironing board also. My room was on the 2nd floor, I was originally facing the street but I asked to be moved b/c I am a light sleeper. The room I ended up in was perfectly quiet, also on the 2nd floor, but might be off-putting to some as it had a basement apt feel b/c the windows were high up and had no view to speak of but my personal preference was to have quiet compared to views.The staff at the Affinia are what make it such a special place. After a long day of touring or business it was so nice to come back to welcome home and cheers! They learn people's names quickly and use them. From the front desk to the bell people, they seemed to be genuinely interested in our well being. Just a very nice group of people to be around. I also loved the punch at the front desk! The club floor is very comfortable, a nice place to relax, and stop for wine and cheese in the late afternoon. The hotel is located very close to two subway lines, including the 4,5,6 and E,V trains. A couple of room for improvement items-the internet access is $9.95 per day or $49.95/week- with so many hotel offering this for free, competitively speaking, I would think the Affinia would too. I did not look at the breakfast at $14.95, so I can't say if it was worth it or not, but it said continental and I've never had a continental breakfast worth $14.95. Ess a Bagel has the best bagels ever and is right across the street! One other drawback is there is no bathroom fan. Those were minor drawbacks, however, in comparison to how nice everyone was and how completely comfortable I felt in the room and hotel, especially getting a good night's sleep every night, being warmly greeted upon check -in, and being warmly greeted everytime I came and went. Highly recommended!

<Content>Large Suite at Great Price I booked a one-bedroom deluxe suite with two queen beds on the hotel web site for a non-refundable rate just over $400/night for 3 nights. As of family of 5, most hotels require us to split into two rooms which gets expensive. We were given room 2001 and it was a huge one bedroom apartment! We had a large living room with a sleeper sofa, a large desk and work space, a dining room with a round table and 4 nice chairs, a full kitchen, large bedroom with two queen size beds, a medium sized bathroom and a wonderful large terrace/balcony overlooking 3rd Ave. The best things about the hotel are the location (good safe neighborhood with restaurants, easy to walk places), the size of our room for the price, and the comfortable beds (crisp white down duvets).The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was nicely cleaned every day while we were out. Housekeeping never bothered us in the morning but always had our room spotless when we returned later in the day.Everything worked well in our room - a/c kept us plenty cool, the showers were hot, the drains worked fine. The furnishings were not brand new but were well maintained and very clean.The Affinia 50 was perfect for us! Anyone who desires more space than an average hotel room should consider this hotel.

<Content>good value, good location Booked at the Affinia after debating many different hotels and booking/cancelling somewhere else. At first we were disappointed that our room was on the 3rd floor (we'd requested a higher floor in hopes of avoiding street noise) but our room was very quiet even though we faced the street and were across from the elevators.Our sink and tub flowed very slowly the 1st day, but we notified the desk staff and it was immediately fixed. The club feature was nice, as we left our luggage with the staff on the last day, but went back and freshened up, got some coffee, etc., before catching a cab to our late afternoon flight. Every time we approached the staff, from front desk to doorman to concierge, we were served quickly with a great attitude. Everyone was very accomdating.Rooms were very comfortable, terrific beds, tiny but functional and nice bathroom, and convenient to have all amenities (shampoo, toothpaste, etc., even breath mints!) provided what with airline restrictions. In-room coffee and tea were a nice touch, too.We would definitely stay again.

<Content>just OK My flight was cancelled and since my next flight was 2 days later, I choose to go back to the city instead of staying at one of those airport hotels. I called some number the ground transportation agent at LaGuardia gave me to book a hotel room and got a quick reservation to stay at Affinia. I have never heard of this hotel before but the agent said it has more than 3 stars. So I agreed and did not have any regrets. It was close to many places of interest.The major thing that bothered me was that my room's bathtub drain was clogged. I think I was also put in a smaller room on a lower floor but paying the price of a larger room on a higher floor. After my stay, I did check Affinia's rates of suites, 2-queen beds rooms and my room. Due to this unsettling feeling, I probably won't be staying at this hotel in the future as there are many hotels on E50s.

<Content>The best place we stayed on our month long trip! We got a great rate at this boutique hotel by booking six months out at a non-refundable rate. We got it for 150 to 200 USD a night which was fantastic for New york! The staff were amazingly friendly and helped us arrange a lot of things. The hotel is very swish and trendy and I would love to stay here again. The location is also great, very safe neighbourhood - although we felt most of Manhatten to be very safe!

<Content>Great hotel Found this hotel through Tripadvisor and wasn't disappointed. We were very grateful that they let us check in ultra early after an overnight flight from San Diego - 8am! A short sleep and we were on our way. We had a 16th floor room which had two beds and a small but adequate bathroom. Reception staff and others were all very friendly and helpful. We had breakfast at local places and not in the hotel however the nightly wine service we did use - very nice touch and comfortable club room. Would certainly go back to this hotel.

<Content>Couldn't have asked for more There were 4 of us in a suite, we had plenty of room. The room was very nice furnished and clean. Everyone at the hotel was of all the help you could ask for. We all felt very safe and at home everytime you came back through the doors. You will not regret you choice of this hotel, the area is convenient also. Wouldn't consider staying anywhere else if I return to NYC.

<Content>A great place to stay My wife and I stayed on the fifth floor in a room with a king size bed. The room was comfortable the staff was helpful. The breakfast buffet was reasonable and very convenient. There was, however, a good deal of street noise, including sirens and air horns from the fire engines leaving a nearby firehouse. The subway is nearby and with a metropass the city is your oyster. If you are inclined to walk there is a lot nearby. We also enjoyed the shops and restaurants when we took the 6 train to the Lexington Ave. and 77th St. neighborhood. Less touristy, but very New York.

<Content>you must stay here Once again I booked this hotel based on trip adviser and was not disappointed , it was perfect and I am very critical of hotels! The rooms were a very generous size for NY rooms and spotlessly clean (which is my main issue with hotels)The only problem we had was we were originally in room 303 and although I'm not bothered about views the air vents and tubes that we looked onto were terribly noisey to the point that even with jet lag I couldn't sleep. The staff were brilliant they offered to move us there and then but suggested that if we waited until the morning we could move to a much higher floor.. I went to bed with ear plugs, they worked a treat. The next day we we're moved to a suite which was huge and made our stay very comfortable.I wouldn't hesitate to reccommend this hotel, the surrounding area is lovely, there's a great mix of restaurants and cheap eateries nearby, in addition the staff were some of the most helpful I've ever come accross.

<Content>Wow! What a find! I've always liked staying in smaller hotels and although this property is not exactly small (212 rooms), it is modest in a city where the Marriott has over 2000 rooms.THe lobby is small and reminds me of so many mid-century apartment buildings on the east side. When you take the elevator to the second floor, you enter a whole new world. As you step off the elevator, you will be greeted by the concierge who will go out of her way to make your trip to NY flawless. Behind her desk, through a glass wall is a wonderful, cheerful public space consisting of a 24-hour coffee/tea bar, a business center with computers and two lounge areas with comfy sofas and club chairs -- one room has a large TV, the other does not.In this area, breakfast is served (a nice selection including nova -- smoked salmon, pastries, cereal, etc) as well as a manager's reception every weekday (early evening) where complimentary wine, cheese and crackers is served and the guest socialize a bit.The room is very spacious. My room had a queen bed, armoire, desk and 2 night stands and there was plenty of room to move around. The tub/shower was large (I'm 6'4 and I did not feel cramped) and there was a floor-to-ceiling mirror on the wall near the door to the room which made it easy to see myself from head to toe on the way in or out.There were three laundry options presented to me when I arrived: do-it-yourself laundry on the basement level; laundry service provided by the hotel staff or sending the laundry to a neighborhood laundering facility. I chose the first option since I need to wash some clothes for a dinner with friends that was happening 3 hours after my arrival. The room had an iron and ironing board.Great staff -- totally commited to making you happy!

<Content>Great value and location for Girls Weekend! Stayed here Thursday - Sunday (6/28 - 7/1) for a girls weekend (4 females in 30s). Booked this hotel several months in advance and got a GREAT rate. We had booked a regular guest room and was a little worried it would be too small for 4 of us to get ready. At check-in we were given a complimentary upgrade without even asking! I'm assuming we had a studio suite and there was plenty of room. We had a small kitchenette with a full size refrigerator, 2 queen beds, a stuffed chair and large desk with chair. There were 2 full length mirrors outside of the bathroom as well as a mirror over the desk - giving us plenty of mirror space for all of us to get ready. The only minor negative was that there wasn't very good lighting except in the bathroom (for putting on make-up). The room was very clean and spacious and the beds were very comfortable. Our first night the air conditioning wasn't working well and it was a bit warm. They fixed the problem the next day and sent a bottle of wine as an apology. VERY good customer service. We enjoyed the free wine and cheese on Thursday afternoon in the club room (offered M-Th, 6-7pm).The location was great! We were able to walk to Barney's, Bloomingdale's, Saks, and major stores on 5th Ave. and Madison. Rockefellar Plaza is literally a few blocks away. There is an Ess-a-Bagel across the street and several diners where you can get a quick breakfast (for less than the $15 breakfast offered at the hotel). There is also a 24 hr. McDonald's next to the hotel (dangerous after a night of drinking!). Dos Caminos (Mexican) is across the street as well (we did not eat here, but I have on a previous trip and it is delicious). There is a subway station about a block or 2 away that has the 6 line which we took down to Spring St. to do SOHO shopping.I would definitely stay here again if we found a good rate. It is not a luxurious hotel, but neither is the price. In this price range in NYC, this hotel is EXCELLENT!

<Content>Highly Recommended Property! Just returned from a 5 day stay at the Affinia 50 and was compelled to say great things about this hotel. Our junior suite had a full kitchen, 2 queen beds and was much roomier than a standard hotel room. The room had cool, contemporary furnishings and was pristine clean. Staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly, starting at check-in and reinforced with every interaction we had with bellmen, housekeeping, concierge, etc. Learned upon arrival the Affinia has a complimentary happy hour with wine several nights a week. Their club level lounge for guests was a great place to relax. Nice, working equipment in their fitness room. Location is great for touring NYC: one block from subway station to downtown / uptown (staff was great at directing us how to navigate the subway to get where we wanted to go), 6 blocks from Rockefeller Center, two blocks from double-decker bus stop, a mile from Central Park. There is a great deli on the corner of 3rd and 51st Street (one block from hotel), where you can buy groceries and pick up a quick meal. Also recommend the Mint restaurant across the street -- scrumptious Indian cuisine. We'll definitely return to this hotel on our next trip to NYC! Outstanding value for the money.

<Content>Look no further! My family and I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Affinia 50.(6/17-6/24). It was our first time to NYC and this hotel is really in a prime location. The hotel is within a short walking distance to Rockefeller Center, 5th ave., American Girl Store, Moma, and Central Park. There are two subway stations within a couple of blocks that can take you to everything you want to see. Directly across the street is Ess a Bagel! (best bagels in the city!) Bliss Spa is on Lexington! One block from the hotel!( My mother and I had the foot reflexology, it was fantastic!)As far as service goes, Affinia 50 was excellent!!! The doormen were always friendly and helpful with which subway train to catch. When I say helpful I mean above and beyond, they mapped out our entire trip to the Museum of Natural History and the subway route to Brooklyn. (we walked the Brooklyn Bridge from the Brooklyn side to Manhattan, Amazing views!!) Guest Services were always aiming to please and a short call away. Anytime we needed more towels or pillows(the hotel has a pillow menu, the whole family tried a different pillow, Fun!) Everything was brought to the room very prompt. The club floor was great and the continental breakfast served their was very good.($14.95) We enjoyed going down to the club floor at night and watching the flat screens ,sipping wine and talking about our day!I have to also mention our room, it was perfect. The room was Clean, large ,it had comfortable beds and Aveda products in the bathroom. We loved this hotel and will stay here when we go back to New York!

<Content>Loved the Affinia 50 We just returned from 3 nights at the Affinia 50 with our 2 college aged daughters. We had a Junior Suite that offered more than ample space for us. There were 2 comfortable beds and a sleeper sofa. The room felt spacious and luxurious and even had a small kitchen with a table and a balcony overlooking 3rd Avenue. The desk staff and bellman were very friendly and helpful. Everything was very clean. We will definitely choose this fine property for our next trip to New York.

<Content>Affinia 50 great location, room so-so The Affinia 50 is in a great location. Staff professional and informative but I wouldn't say overly friendly. Bed and pillows very comfortable although room showed signs of wear around the edges. Location of room near ice/vending machines made it a bit noisy; in addition just above what I think was the HVAC unit so that made it a bit noisy. I would stay there again for the location.

<Content>Perfect I travelled with two teenage children and found the hotel to be exactly what I had hoped for. It had huge rooms and a lovely bathroom. As we were taking an evening flight transatlantic, the hotel offered the opportunity to use the leisure centre shower facilities to shower and change after checkout and before the flight. I was very grateful for this as we spent the day out and about and it was hot and sunny.I would stay here again without hesitation if I travel to New York again.

<Content>Favorite hotel in NYC This hotel is my favorite place to stay in NYC and it is mostly because of the staff. I stay here often for business and for the past 3 years, the staff has been consistent. They always address me by name and are extremely accomodating. It is also a perfect location. I highly recommend.

<Content>Great for families The hotel was perfect for our family of 4 (two girls aged 13 and 11).Location for Manhattan was spot on. The room was very spacious and came with a small kitchen.The front staff couldn't have been more helpful.The downside was the breakfast facility (limited) but there were good diners on the same street, so no problem.I'd highly recommend the hotel to you.

<Content>Great hotel for touring NYC My husband and I stayed at the Affinia 50 in June 2007. We found the hotel by calling hotels.com after finding most all of the hotels we looked at booked or exorbitant in price. We were very pleased with the hotel and the location. For NYC the rooms were very large and contained a small kitchen. We found the lobby often smelled like sun tan lotion for some odd reason, but the hotel was perfect for our needs and we couldn't have asked for a better location.We particularly enjoyed the pillow menu where you could choose among several different pillows to be brought to your room. We had a great view from our room (for NYC) and the hotel is located next to a VIP hotspot that had paparazzi standing in front of every night trying to get photos of whichever celebrities were inside.We definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family going to NYC.

<Content>Wouldn't change a thing This hotel has their act together. Very professional, friendly, approachable staff. Wonderful, clean comfortable and LARGE rooms. Very quiet and safe. No frills lobby but who cares about that? Good breakfast a few steps from the hotel (turn right as you exit the lobby) and a little market and McDonalds just around the corner (turn left as you exit). This hotel puts all of the emphasis on the rooms and staff and has very competative rates for NYC. The location is not perfect for subway travel but still very good. Stay here!

<Content>Nice stay at the Affinia 50 My family and I spent four nights in the Affinia 50 in April. Overall we enjoyed our stay. The hotel was clean and sleek, with very comfortable bedding. The doormen and house keeping were excellent. The front desk and the conceirge desk seemed to be slightly overwhelmed at times. Street noise was only noticable on a few occasions.We spent the first two nights in a Junior Suite. The room was very spacious with a king and a queen sleeper sofa. The bathroom was spacious and there was plenty of room for storage. The kids didn't complain too much about sleeping on the fold out. The kitchenette was a nice feature. It's alway nice to have fridge stocked with drinks. We stayed in this room over the weekend due to availability. It was a bit pricey.The second half of our trip we stayed in a room a 2-queen room. This was a bit smaller, with a tight bathroom. However, both beds were very comfortable and everyone slept very well. There was a kitchenette in this room as well. The weekday prices on this room were quite reasonable.We never tried the food the breakfast at the hotel.Valet parking for the stay was easy and convenient ,but expensive. There is a parking deck across the street, but I never took the time to check it out.The hotel is just a block southeast of the Waldorf Astoria. It is only a few blocks from many mid-town attractions without being in the middle of the crowds. Subway stops are very convenient. There are several good places to eat within 200 yards. We particularly enjoyed Ess-A-Bagel and Chin Chin.

<Content>Surprising value -- new favorite The Affinia 50 is a terrific find in NYC from a price-value standpoint. The rooms are spacious, well-appointed and downright comfortable. And quiet. We had a low floor (4th) across from the elevator and had no noise problems at all -- even though the hotel was busy during our stay. Of course there is some street noise; this is New York people! But the noise was minimal -- dramatically muffled by tight windows and solid walls. The second floor lounge area was a real plus: nicely appointed and welcoming. I spent several hours there while my travel companion napped in the room. They offered multiple newspapers, free coffee and tea, big screen TV and lots of comfy chairs and sofas. The hotel staff was extra-friendly and helpful, even the housekeepers greeted us pleasantly while going about their work. Of all the NYC hotels in which I've stayed, this is the best. And I'll make it my regular in the future.

<Content>Loved Affinia 50!!  Staff was extremely kind, courteous, helpful and genuine. All of them gave great tips on things to do and places to go. The trip was incredible thanks to them. The manager also personally welcomed us upon our arrival. They pay so much attention to detail and there were so many little perks for guests. Loved how they had a pillow menu with so many choices of pillows. Rooms are extremely clean. The hotel is also in a great location. Would definitely stay there again without any hesitation! Also would definitely recommend to all friends and family.

<Content>Three S's - Smart, spacious and service After reading positive reviews in Tripadvisor, I decided to book into the Affinia 50 in New York for our short stay during our trip to USA. The hotel was more than expected. We had booked a suite - it was smart and modern, spacious, with superbly comfortable beds and pillows. It was spotlessly clean with Aveda bath products. The service was fantasic, all staff were helpful, and friendly. As an added bonus it was in a wonderful location for our shopping and visiting tourist attractions. The rates were also very reasonable compared to other New York hotels.Living on the other side of the world (Australia) it is often difficult to choose suitable accommodation. However on this ocasion I can only say we hit the jackpot!

<Content>Good (not outstanding) hotel in a nice location. A nice little hotel with a great location. The good: VERY comfortable beds and linens and a large enough room that we didn't feel cramped. Very clean.The not-so-good: Street noise and noise from other guest rooms kept my husband from sleeping. (I am a sound sleeper, and would sleep through almost anything.) We were able to get a reasonable weekend rate and at that rate I would consider the Affinia 50 a very good choice. At the usual daily rate, however, I would not recommend it.

<Content>Loved Affinia 50! Wow! This is a great hotel! a real hidden gem. Our room was huge and immaculate. I cannot say enough about the staff. The absolute friendliest and most accomodating staff I have encountered. From the minute I walked up to the door I was treated royally. The club floor is a great asset with 2 big flat screen tvs, lots of comfy couches and games, books, a coffee area etc. A real oasis in NYC. The best location..walked to bloomies, rockefeller center, times square, american girl etc etc. On mothers day i was handed a rose as i entered the lobby. Can't praise this hotel enough!!!

<Content>Nice place We stayed in a junior suite at the Affinia 50 for several days in May. The suite was very spacious - two beds, desk, couch, chair, ottoman - and nicely decorated. The bathroom was well-appointed and a nice size. The Aveda toiletries are a nice touch. There room included a small kitchen - the cabinets and appliances were pretty outdated, but it was nice to have a fridge. The beds were the most comfortable I've ever slept in in a hotel. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Overall, a very good experience, and a good bargain, especially for New York.

<Content>Friendly, clean and spacious Stayed here for 6 nights last week in a studio suite at about $350 per night plus taxes. Great room with bathroom, kitchenette and two double beds. Room 807 - very quiet, clean and with all the amenities you would expect. Staff very helpful and friendly. Location superb as my conference was at the Waldorf Astoria where rooms were described as expensive and tired. No bar or restaurant but a very good buffet breakfast ($15) in the common rooms on the second floor - a good healthy option compared with the local diners. My colleague was given a noisy room on the second floor at first but was relocated to the eighteenth floor the next night. I suspect you need to check in early to get the best rooms. Would definitely stay here again for midtown vacation.

<Content>What a great place Great location and really friendly staff especially the doormen.Rooms were extremely clean,comfortable, beautifully decorated and excellent value for the location. We could walk every where although there are subways all around the hotel. Lovely Club Room where you can get a continental breakfast but there are plenty of places to eat nearby. Would be good if there was a bar also the reception is quite small and has limited seating while waiting for your car.We would return the hire car for our NY stay and then pick another up again if heading further afield. Transfers to airports are easy.

<Content>Great location I've stayed in two Affinia properties (the Dumont  50), and both are outstanding values. Location is good (more neighborhoody), rooms are large and nicely furnished with multiple seating areas and small kitchens. We were in NYC the weekend of the April Nor'Easter (8 of rain on Sunday!) and it was great to have a kitchen for our bagels (skip the overpriced breakfast in the lounge) and more room to spread out and read the Times while the rain raged outside.Just a couple of quibbles - the elevators can be really slooooww sometimes, and service from the front desk staff can be a little spotty - tried calling them 3 times from the room and no one ever picked up. Overall, we'll certainly stay with Affinia again.

<Content>Great place for frequent business trips I travel to Manhattan often for business, and the Affinia 50 has become my home away from home. Not only is it within walking distance of my office in Midtown, it is also close to many tourist sites, great shopping, and good eating.I particularly enjoy the Club Room at the Affinia. It is fun to lounge, read the paper, and unwind after work if my schedule allows. I also enjoy that I may visit the Club Room anytime I am in Manhattan, regardless of whether I am staying at the Affinia or not. The concierge has been very helpful, and the entire staff at the Affinia has always been wonderful.The beds at the Affinia 50 are the most comfortable of any hotel I've stayed in Manhattan. They are a welcome respite after a long day's work.If you choose this hotel, I would recommend requesting a room on a higher floor. The one time I had a room on the 2nd floor, my AC did not work very well. A colleague of mine, who also had a room on the 2nd floor, complained of something similar. When I've stayed in rooms on higher floors, I didn't have any trouble with the temperature.The fitness room is a bit meager and warm on occasion, but otherwise, it is nice to have workout facilities on site.I am a bit tired of the Affinia's room service menu ... but this will happen when staying at one place frequently.Overall, I am the most comfortable with the Affinia 50 out of the 4-5 hotels I've tried in the vicinity of my office. I would recommend it without hesitation.

<Content>Lots of Room - Loved it! We stayed at the Affinia 50 on April 13 - 15, 2007. We booked the Amercian Girl Package. Originally we reserved a Studio, but were pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us at no extra charge to a Jr. Suite. I have stayed in NYC a lot for business and usually stay at the Crowne Plaza in Times Square, but this time we had two children along and couldn't have been happier with the room and hotel. We had a living area w/pull-out, two large, comfortable beds, a full kitchen (bring utensils if you plan to use) and bathroom. There was plenty of storage and the pillow menu was great. The pillow that plugs into an IPOD was a big hit with my 10 year old.The Club Floor was spacious and bright and the free coffee was good. The location was super. The diner up on 50th and 3rd, Morning Star Cafe had good breakfast at reasonable prices.Only Negatives - the safe in our room didn't work, but we did not call about it. The bathrobe was missing upon check-in, but the front desk brought a new unopened one to us when we called.The temperature control wasn't the best. Tried to run just the fan for outside noise reduction, but it poured out heat no matter how it was set. We were on the 8th floor facing 50th - so we had some street noise. It wasn't excessive though - we live in the mountains with NO noise - so we notice any noise.All and all - loved the place - and will go back !BTW - if you are a baseball fan - try the Yankee Stadium Tour (when there isn't a game) for a reasonable, memorable tour.If you plan to go to Liberty Park - plan ahead - they give out a limited number of passes online and the day of - to get inside the Statue of Liberty. We missed out on this, but walked around the outside and got fabulous pictures.If you have kids -try Ruby Foos (Pan-Asian) on 49th and Broadway - good food, loud, and roomy - has a kid's menu too.

<Content>Fabulous! Spent 6 nights at the Affinia 50. Lovely hotel, great staff and comfortable bedrooms. Mini fridge in guest room was unexpected and really handy.The Aveda products in bathroom were fab, and the clubroom was very tasteful and relaxing.Highlight though has to be the doormen, so helpful and friendly. They would do anything for you. Fully reccomend the Affinia and would have no hestitation in returning.PS make sure you visit the luncheonette for breakfast, the place is fab!

<Content>Great neighborhood hotel. I just got back from a shopping trip to NYC. I originally found out about the Affinia 50 hotel from reading reviews on the TripAdvisor site. And I'm super happy that I did because I probably would not have known about this hotel otherwise. The service was great. The entire staff at the hotel was incredibly curteous. Mid-way through our trip, they recognized us by sight making us feel very welcome throughout our stay. The room was very well appointed. The beds were crisp, clean and very comfy. They even let you select from a menu of pillow options. The bathroom felt recently updated. We stayed in a unit that included a kitchen. Although, the kitchen was very dated, it was very convenient having a full sized fridge in the room for our water, soda, other beverages and restaurant leftovers. The cleaning staff was fantastic! The location is excellent. It's one block away from the Waldorf and just a few blocks from Madisson and 5 Avenue shopping! Right around the corner is an excellent bagel shop = Essa Bagel. The only downside is that the doors slam pretty loud. So every morning I woke up to a symphony of slamming doors as folks left their rooms. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel for a family Wow, what a huge room! We booked a small suite for our family of 5, and it was one of the most spacious rooms you can ever hope to find in New York. It was comfortable, very clean, quiet, and new-feeling. I expected the worst when booking a room in Manhattan, but this room was first-class in every way. The concierge service was also excellent. The clincher was that the hotel was easy walking distance to Times Square, the Theatre District, St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rockefeller Center. The room was more expensive than we usually pay, but it was well worth the price. I really have nothing but raves for this hotel!

<Content>Great Location and Large Rooms .... and a Few Cautions We just returned from a 3 night visit at the Affinia 50. The location is fantastic - within walking distance to Central Park, Rockafeller Centre, Times Square and many other great spots. The one bedroom suite (there were 3 of us) is large - with a nice living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom and very large living room.A note of caution if you are booking directly through the hotel. You should book on line and print out the confirmation. When we arrived we were advised that there had been a rate change (and increase of about $60 per night). I was asked to show my confirmation print out to prove the rates I was quoted. Having my confirmation number solved the matter -- but we were astounded that they tried to just increase our rate at check in.The lounge on the 2nd floor is really nice. However, the coffee/tea maker was broken and the promised wireless computer access was for a sign up charge only. Most hotels include wireless for their guests these days, so we found the claims to wireless access a little misleading.Overall, though we had a good stay and enjoyed the Affinia 50.

<Content>A Great Place to Stay I took my three children for a long weekend in New York in late March 2007 and had a very pleasant experience at the Affinia 50. The location is very convenient, right on the corner of Third and 50th, just about a block from the Waldorf. For about $450 a night we had a one-bedroom apartment with a full kitchen, dining area, comfortable living room and large bedroom with two queens. It's ideal for a family, and while not elegant, the modern furnishings were attractive. The doorman (wearing a snappy black leather fedora) always greeted us cheerfully. The only downsides: no restaurant, services here are minimal, the lobby is tiny and not particularly welcoming, and at times only one of the two elevators was operating. But for this price, all this space in a great location (same block as The Benjamin) is hard to beat.

<Content>Great stay for a couple seeing the city Wonderful location. Close to many things we wanted to see. Close to a subway stop for those longer trips. Very friendly and helpful staff. Overall a great place to call home while you explore the city.Minor negatives: 1) lack of a restaurant for a real breakfast but there are two wonderful diner-style places within a 2 minute walk.2) Street noise makes earplugs a must on the lower hotel floors if you are a light sleeper- but this would be true of any hotel in the city.

<Content>Very Good Stay GOOD STUFFLocation -- Midtown, within three blocks of two subway stations. Also great bus services for all directions.Beds -- Me, hubby,and teenage daughters had two queen size beds. (Other hotels have doubles, not queens.) Beds were very comfortable with crisp bedding.Rooms -- Having a small kitchen (full size fridge, microwave etc.) was wonderful. Stored dinner leftovers, bottled wine, desserts, snacks, milk, and take out food from Pax and Azure. Lots of TV stations including one HBO. Lots of storage space, even a cupboard in the bathroom. Not bothered by the noise even though we faced the street on the 6th floor. Yes there are sirens,trash trucks, honking horns etc. But that's what you get in any city. (We live in the country so we're more alert to man-made noises.)Freebies -- Wine and cheese in the 2nd level lounge (between 6-7pm) was a treat, especially before heading to the theatre. Copy of Time Out New York in the Lobby.Staff: Helpful and cheerful apart from the fan incident and poor directions from the 2nd floor concierge.NEEDS WORKAir Conditioning/Fan -- Sounded like a rotating metal vent in a barn. On the first night, we turned off the fan before going to sleep. We didn't turn it on again during the entire 7 nights stay -- even though the temps dropped below zero outside. When I complained to the front desk, he told me how to turn off the fan -- no offer of a technician to fix the problem or moving to another room.Elevators -- Can be slow and crowded, especially at check out times. A number of times, bypassed us even though our call button was pressed.Faucets -- Affina is not alone, I've encountered this in numerous boutique hotels. Many, many unlabeled faucets that turn at strange angles or have to be pushed/pulled with precise force to get water. After 7 days, our 14 year old still could not get the shower to behave without meticulous adjustments by me. Plumbing designers sure sold these hotels a crock!RECOMMENDATIONSUnlimited Ride MetroCard -- $24 per person for unlimited subway and local bus rides until midnight, 7 days from day of first use. We used the card probably four times per day. (Individual rides normally cost $2.) Only drawback is that it can used again only 18 minutes after one use. So if you mess up, you have to buy a ticket or wait 18 minutes. Chinatown shopping -- especially for teenage girls!NY Tenement Museum -- Lower East Side on Orchard Street. Excellent use of two hours and great area for shopping and eating -- Katz's Deli and Guss'es pickles.CityPass -- $53 adult. Allows one time entrance to Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises, Empire State Building Observatory, the Guggenheim Museum, the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art within a nine day period. Makes sense only if you intend to visit at least four of these.Two Hour Circle Line Sightseeing Cruise -- incredible view of skylines and Statue of LibertyEss-a-bagel on 3rd. Just across the street. Amazing fresh bagels.Grand Central Station: Go for the station itself and the fast food court. They have NY food chains and not the usual BK or McDs. Only one subway stop on the 6.Times Square -- only a 20 minute stroll away and sooo full of humanity!1/2 price ticket booth at the Marriott Marquis -- saw the Drowsy Chaperone at 50% off. Seem to be lots available. About a 15 minute wait at 3:00 pm.Most of all go with try anything attitude and don't be scared. NY truly is an amazing place.

<Content>Excellent service, great location I stayed at the Affinia 50 in a 1 bedroom suite (2 queen beds) with my wife and parents on a long weekend trip to New York.We found the location to be excellent for seeing Manhattan - easy to walk to Central Park and the big shops around 5th avenue, and also close to Grand Central station and Rockafella. The subway on Lexington  51st is great to get around most tourist routes.The hotel staff were always friendly and helpful, and we were made to feel that no request was too much trouble. The doormen were well groomed and extremely cheerful, whatever time we saw them!The suite itself was luxuriously large and very clean as well as comfortable, and the hotel provides beds with memory foam matresses and a choice of several types of pillows, which made sleeping there even more enjoyable.We would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in New York!

<Content>Nice NYC stay My family and I stayed in NYC for 2 nights the weekend of the 23rd of March.The accomodations were excellent.The only problem we had was with the rate for the car.We had been quoted one rate and were being charged another that was significantly higher.The management ended up meeting us in the middle .At checkout we still had a problem with the parking fee as we had been told that we would not have to pay the third day rate as we had only just barely gone over the time .In the end we were charged.A member of the Affinia staff was going to call us the next day once she had gone through the proper channels to try and fix the problem but as of yet we have not heard from anyone.

<Content>great stay as well as location I also went to NYC for a weekend getaway with girlfriends (THE BFFS of Southern MD!) we LOVED the stay, the smell (in the lobby) the beds(so comfy) and the location. THe employees are fantastic! EVERYONE had a smile, were there to help and even told us where to go for the best BAGELS in NYC ---right around the corner on 3rd--ESS'S??If you go, stay at the Affinia 50. you won't regret it!

<Content>Couldn't have hoped for more Me and my girlfriend stayed in the Affinia 50 at the beginning of March and was delighted with our choice. We had chosen this hotel based on the reviews of this website and we were not disappointed.The room was large, with a very big bed and even a 'pillow menu' that allowed you to choose your pillow of choice for the best nights sleep! The room was also clean and well set out.Location was perfect for everything that we wanted to do, within a short walk from Central Park and Rockafellar Centre aswell as the shops of 5th Avenue (which my girlfriend was pleased with!!)Aswell as all of this, the staff were extremly friendly and put thereselves out to help with any of our problems and needs.All in all, the perfect trip!

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed here with my parents after reading reviews on trip advisor, and we were all impressed with the hotel. We arrived before official check in and so my room was not ready, however they were not expecting my parents for few days (it was booked though airmiles 鈥?we did not find out if it was the hotel鈥檚 fault). Luckily they could accommodate them and told us to come back at a certain time. Unfortunately when we came back the rooms were still not ready. In need of a rest we decided to wait in the lounge area, an hour later only one of the rooms was ready (contrary to more promises). When we finally did get the second room it had been upgraded to a suite and my parents were given a bottle of wine and a complementary breakfast. So they were very good about the problems, it is just a shame they had not given us a more accurate time for the rooms being ready we could have had an enjoyable afternoon sightseeing instead. That aside the rooms were of a high standard, very comfortable, clean and even a choice of pillows available. Door staff were extremely helpful and always on hand when needed, they provided loads of maps and event info when they knew we were tourists. Internet access in the lounge area with free printing available - very handy. Only other negative point was the breakfast - they selection was limited, with very little warm food, once items were gone they were not replenished. It was also served in the lounge area so there were not proper tables to eat at. For my parents it was free so not too bad but for what they were charging, definitely not worth the money. There are no shortage of places to grab breakfast in the area so I would recommend giving it a miss if not included in your room rate.Despite the slight problem with check in problem, I would stay here again.

<Content>Just adding to the praise After reading the positive reviews here, I was delighted to get a room here for $200 a night (including taxes and fees, via Expedia.) My experience was great; I really can't think of even the smallest thing to complain about. Spacious, clean room, nice staff, good location.

<Content>great suite We had a great stay at the Affinia 50. Lobby was small and we expected a small room but what a great suite! My broyther and I decided to have a suite instead of renting separate rooms. It was worth it. Two Queen fluffy beds and 3 different types of pillows... (6 per bed!) The room had a kitchenette, a sitting area (large sofa) and a chair. Wiorking desk + internet (extra charge) . The heating was silent. Helpful staff. Busy streets around. Six blocks from Broadway Ave. but 10 blocks from Theaters. Definitely going back again!

<Content>Great hotel, great price! My friends and I just got back from a girls' weekend in NYC  we stayed at the Affinia 50. The $219/night price (not including the NY taxes  fees) was WELL worth it. As soon as we got there, we entered the hotel and the aroma was incredible! I immediately felt as if we were in the middle of the Carribbean at a spa! Believe it or not, the aroma made me feel relaxed and happy every time I entered the lobby (little touches that made a difference). Upon check in we were offered a room up grade. Instead of 2 rooms with 2 double beds, we were offered 2 suites, each with a kitchenette, king bed  pull out couch. We turned the offer down due to there being 4 of us (and no one wanting to sleep on the pull out), not to mention that we didn't plan on being in the room except for sleeping anyway. The thought of them upgrading us did not go unappreciated though (the decision was difficult). There was a slight discrepency with the price of parking our car, but the hotel researched the web-site where we saw the cheaper parking price and honored that price, no questions asked! As we were getting settled, housekeeping brought my roommate and myself a bag of extra toiletries (which are Aveda products-- What a nice change from the typical drugstore brands!).The room was roomy enough  the beds were comfortable beyond belief! Not to mention that we walked to 5th Ave, Madison Ave, and Times Square numerous times a day. It was only about a $12 taxi ride to Grenwich Village, Soho, Chinatown, and Little Italy. A very convenient hotel (especially for the price)!I would stay at the Affinia 50 again in a hearbeat! I really cannot say anything negative about our hotel stay! I highly recommend the Affinia 50.

<Content>Disappointing My boyfriend and I stayed at the Affinia the night of Feb 17, 2007, for a quick getaway. My heart sank when we walked into the room. It was was bare and small with a tiny window at least a foot above eye-level. Yes, there was a minibar, and a TV with a movie selection. The view I'd been looking forward to was of a chunk of a brick wall about 2 feet away from our window. The minibar was empty, and none of the listed movies were available for viewing, for some mysterious reason. We called about the movies, to no avail. We had no control of the temperature in the room, and the window did not open. We called for a fan, and it was, in fact, delivered. It performed passably in creating a modicum of airflow in the stuffy atmosphere of the room. They did have Aveda shampoo and soap, however, so at least I got to take some good products home. And the location was convenient--I got a nice manicure at the excellent Bliss spa, very nearby.FYI, our room was on the second floor--just make sure you ask about your view.

<Content>Our own NYC apartment! My two children and I recently stayed five nights at the Affinia 50, having booked a one bedroom suite on line. The high rating and positive reviews on tripadvisor were the reason I chose this property. Our rate varied from $289 Sunday to $379 Wed/Thurs. which I felt was great for the area and space. The one bedroom suite was very large and accommodating; plenty of closet space and drawers. I was very pleased with the unkeep, furniture and linen. It's not luxurious, but not cheap and shabby either. The Aveda products were a plus. The kitchen was a bit old, but functional and clean. We had everything we needed and more!The location was perfect for walking to Rockefellar plaza, Times Sq., Central Park, shopping and dining. We ate breakfast every morning at the Morning Star Cafe, which was right around the corner. A much better deal than the Lunceonette beside the hotel. We ordered in a couple nights and ate out the rest of the time. A big help is menupages.com - it lists every restuarant by neighborhood, their menus and reviews. Invaluable when in the city.

<Content>Perfect! I stayed here for 3 nights in March on a solo weekend break. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was spotless and comfy.Brilliant location, 3 blocks away from Rockefeller Centre and close to loads of famous landmarks.The suite on the 2nd floor with comfy sofas and tea and coffee was really handy during the time between check out and waiting to go to the airport.Next time I go to NY I will definitely stay here.Loved it!

<Content>Great Location, Fair Rate Convenience: Within walking Distance of many major attractions like the UN, Times Square, Central Park, St. PAtricks Cathedral, Rockefeller Center etc. and many Restaurants.Clean Room, friendly staff, a little delay in getting room after arrival. Because it is NY, we did not stay in the hotel, except to sleep, and it was quiet considering people were reving up for New Years Celebrations.Famly had a good time. ( 3 night stay)

<Content>Rude service and VERY Noisy Room, (the side facing the 50th st) My room is very noisy. It is directly above a loading zone on 50th st and is facing the corner of 3rd and 50th. During the night, trucks kept loading, back-uping incessively. On top of that, cars honking and sirens were all over the place. The room does not have double windows to isolate all these noises!!! I literally could not close my eyes through out the night and woke up completely stressed out. It is definitely, no doubt THE WORST hotel experience ever. That is including the cheap motels that I have stayed in.I noticed this problem after checking into the room and asked to change. The response was: you should sort it out with your friends. (I have a few other friends staying in the hotel as well.)There is a double tree hotel and a boutique hotel called (Benjamin) literally next door. I have stayed in Ben for a few nights but never had such problems. And the rates are the same!!!Please stay away from this hell hole at all costs!!!

<Content>Beautiful hotel! Just got back from a girls weekend in New York. We struggled to get an affordable place for 2 nights and my friend scored a great rate for this hotel. Based on good reviews from trip advisor, we headed to the big city. This hotel did not disappoint....It felt like a vacation in itself - very clean and contemporary decor. The beds and pillows were so so comfortable (and did I mention clean?). We got upgraded to a small suite that had a tiny, but fully filled kitchen and also a large desk that would have been great had we been there for business. We were able to use (for a fee) the computer and printer in their business center and they had a lovely lounge area where we waited a little for the room to be ready (we were early..not their fault).Look at the location on a map before you decide - it was very near to a subway line and not a huge walk to broadway, MOMA, Grand Central station, etc.. (we have good walking legs, though)I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A real find After reading all the positive reviews of this property, and knowing we would be centrally located with extraordinary space for the price, we were primed for disappointment - which did NOT happen! If you are looking for spacious rooms, great location, and excellent service - and, who isn't - this hotel is for you. Our 'junior suite' was easily twice the size of an ordinary hotel room, especially in expensive NYC, yet at half the cost you would expect. Our two daugters shared an ordinary hotel room here as well, with a tariff only somewhat below expected for the size and location, but were also very happy.The managers put us into a street-side room at first, which has the advantage of the view but the disadvantage of noise. I called downstairs at near midnight (when a bus pulled up and sounded his air horn!) to ask for an inside room change. They responded immediately, found a room on the same floor (but even larger!), and offered to help us move! The elevators, often an Achilles heel of hotels, especially smaller ones, worked remarkably well - fast and efficient. The exercise room appears to be new, with 2 new Life Cycles (both with heart rate monitors) - one upright, one recumbant - both with toe straps, a real rarity. You will be hard-pressed to find this anywhere else in the City. The breakfast facility is very nicely furnished, but serves only a continental for $15. When we wanted full breakfasts, the hotel staff itself directed us to the 'luncheonette', 50 meters up the block, which was about $10. But, the kichenettes, equipped with service for 4, make it easily possible for you to provide your own, for a lot less. And, despite the very friendly and helpful staff, there was none of the usual discomfort found in larger hotels, I mean the shilling for tips. At no point did we feel under this distasteful pressure.Be aware that the internet will cost you about $10/day, but, at their room rates, you can hardly complain. You will not find here the luxurious, and often useless, amenities, such as terricloth bathrobes and slippers. And, if you are looking for a large lobby, or a grand atrium, look elsewhere (and expect to hear your wallet complain).No property is perfect in every respect, of course. My two criticisms, though, are very minor: The hot water took a very long time to become hot from the sink faucet (something amiss with their recirculation system). And, the A/C was too noisy until I 'adjusted' the knobless fan speed with my faithful Leatherman toolkit, whereupon it was close to perfect. Overall, though, this is a definite winner, and one I will use whenever i find myself in this city.

<Content>Great hotel for business travel I love this hotel! I travel a lot with work, and most often stay in places like Hiltons and Marriotts It's so refreshing to stay in a lovely, clean, well-appointed and elegant hotel in Manhattan that is not a Marriott and doesn't cost a fortune.Some of the rooms are small here, but I got lucky and was placed in a double with a kitchen. I can't wait to come back on a weekend with my husband and sons - it's ideal (and a million times more comfortable than the awful room we had in Sept. at the Marriott East Side one block away...what a bad experience).Have also stayed at the Affinia Dumont which is great - but this is a better location for me, and just as nice. And, I love the Benjamin, on this same block, but it is usually considerably more expensive and often there are no available rooms.All in all, this is my new favorite hotel, and hotel group, in NYC.

<Content>Midown Man When you see a room on a hotel's website you wonder whether it will resemeble anything like the picture. To my great surprise everything about the room was fabulous and my wife was very pleased with the mini-aveda products.Find a hotel in Manhatten at the best of times is not cheap so you have to find the right balance between location, style and price. My wife and I along with another couple stayed at the Affinia 50 and we were very pleased with the service we received from the charming doorman and polite reception staff.When I next vist NY I will happily return to the Affinia 50 as it was located in Midtown East and was central to all our requirements. The majority of the Manhatten was at most a $20 ride away. I would suggest using a UK website to book your hotel as I intially booked the hotel on a US based website which did not quote the taxes. I subsequently cancelled the booking and re-booked via the a uk website which included all taxes.

<Content>Superb Service My wife and I just returned from 5 nights at the Affinia.It was excellent. The location to both the sights and the subway cannot be bettered.On our arrival we were immediately upgraded to a better room which was spacious and clean and had a great view of the hustle and bustle of Midtown.The staff were very friendly and happy and really made you feel looked after. The welcome home greeting you receive from the staff when you return from a day out is a really nice touch.The cafe a few doors down is excellent and Mint, the Indian restaurant just across the road was one of the best places we ate at.Our one small gripe was that the ceiling above the bath leaked (presumably when the occupants of the room above showered). We told reception and they said they had fixed it, but it looked as though it continued to leak.All in all, though, we would highly recommend the Affinia.

<Content>Excellent Hotel. Thanks to Tripadvisor!! I just arrived back from NY today! I booked my long weekend at the Affinia 50 because of the reviews on this site and the balance of price, hotel and room quality, and location. The hotel is in a superb location, right behind the Waldorf Astoria. I walked from Grand Central Station in under 15 minutes and was greeted very warmly at the front desk. I was upgraded from a double room to a Junior Suite, at no cost, and the man gave me a map explaining where I was in relation to the major attractions.The suite was spotless, clean, of ample size, nicely decorated and warm. It was exactly as it appears on the Affinia website, in fact. I was on the ninth floor, facing the street, (some of the rooms must face 3rd Avenue, which has to be slightly noisier). It was my birthday the day before my arrival. I was delighted to find a huge chocolate cake in the fridge and a bottle of very drinkable Merlot on the table, with a note wishing me a happy birthday. I received two phone calls in the first hour of my stay, from hotel staff, introducing themselves and offering their assistance, should I need it. They also wished me happy birthday... It doesn't get much better than this. I wouldn't dream of booking anywhere else if I went back.

<Content>Great Apartment Style Room - Excellent View. Just Wonderful !!! My daughter had to go to New York for college dance auditions and I wanted a room with a kitchen for convenience and enough room for my husband, daughter and I to feel comfortable. I was so pleasantly surprised with the size of the Rooms at the Affinia 50. We were in the 1 bedroom guest room and it was just wonderful. Very nice living area with nice modern furniture and a dining table for 4 people. Small galley style kitchen, not very modern, but still quite adequate and convenient. with a dishwaser, refrigerator, stove and microwave. The kitchen cabinets were adequately stocked with silverware and glasses, cups, etc. Everything was in good condition and very clean. The only thing I didn't like was the small size hotel room coffee pot. Although packets of coffee were provided to make the small pot of coffee, I would have preferred a full size coffee pot. That is truly my only complaint and that is only because I knew we would have a full kitchen and I brought my own coffee and filters. I like my own coffee and I don't care for those small coffee pots with the premeasured packs of coffee. I'm a picky coffee drinker. The view from our window was spectacular. We could look out the large window in the living room down on the street and see all the activity. We were in easy walking distance to Rockafeller center and Time Square. There are many stores and restaurants close by including a McDonalds and drug store right around the corner which were so convenient. The staff was extremely attentive and polite. I would highly recommend this hotel. Parking was a breeze even though the street was quite crowded to pull up to the front of the hotel. We simply pulled up as close as we could to the curb and we were immediately greeted by someone to help us. Our car was immediately valet parked and we were on our way to check into our room. Absolutey great staff at the Affinia every step of he way. Both doormen that we encountered during our stay were so friendly and just simply wonderful men. Talkative and friendly in every regard. They made use feel welcome. Our room was quite large by any standard, much less New York. I have stayed in just a one room guest room with two beds in other hotels in NYC and paid a comparable price or a higher price and this room was so much bigger and more functional for a family or for a couple. The one bedroom suite is worth every penny and more. It is well appointed and quite large with a separate bedroom..... and the bed was just heavenly. Very comfortable and plush. I highly recommend this hotel. I have stayed in many hotels in New York and this is truly a great place for the price. Worth every penny. Convenient location, easy parking, great staff, and absolutely lovely accomodations. I thoroughly loved my stay. Couldn't ask for much more.

<Content>Great Home Base for Exploring the City After reading tripadvisor ratings of the Affinia 50, we booked for a three night stay the week of Valentine's Day, Feb. 13-16. We were very pleased by every aspect of our stay, and found it a great home base for exploring the city. The Affinia 50 is conveniently located to lots of Midtown attractions, restaurants, and the subway. We were able to walk to the Rockefeller Center, the theater district, Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, Grand Central Station, and more. The room was very attractive, very clean and more spacious than we expected. The best feature of the room was the bed, which was perhaps the most comfortable of any hotel bed we have ever experienced. The staff of the hotel were very friendly and helpful. The Affinia 50 was perfect for our winter get-away, and it is a place that we would most definitely stay again. Absolutely no complaints or concerns, only compliments for the Affinia 50!

<Content>Felt like home This is our second stay at the Affinia 50. The staff are always welcoming. We were fortunate enough to obtain a suite, with kitchen facilities, lounge and dining room. The room was always clean. Our room was located towards the back of the hotel, nice and quite. Excellent deli around the corner. Central location. Great value and spacious.

<Content>Worthwhile if they hold the prices My room was almost absurdly large, particularly for this (or any other) area of Manhattan. Nothing was absolutely top-notch, but everything about the property was at least decent; cleanliness, bed quality, etc.One problem that wasn't handled as well as I would have liked. Around 8:15 one morning, I headed for the shower before a 9 o'clock meeting. No hot water; none. I called the front desk, and they sounded puzzled; said they would check with engineering. 15 minutes later, no response, and still no hot water. I called the front desk again, and they seemed even more shocked; said they would send engineering up to my room. 15 or 20 minutes later, still nothing, and still no hot water. I called again, and the manager told me it was a mechanical problem and the whole hotel had no hot water, and beyond that they really didn't know what to tell me. I was pretty steamed (ha!); took a bracing cold shower, got dressed, and then the manager called to tell me the hot water was back!Part of me thinks this could happen anywhere, but the fact of the matter is it generally doesn't, and that makes me wonder if their overall physical plant is as well maintained as it ought to be. The manager was pretty nice, and it was nice of him to call me back when the hot water returned (although it was too late for me), but the overall confusion and non-responsiveness through my first couple phone calls were aggravating. He took a big chunk off my bill, but I'd have rather had the hot shower!Business center on the 2d floor has a couple computers and a printer, which is handy, although the computer (which you pay for with a credit card swipe) was not the most user friendly system, and the printer (a Brother inkjet) just sucked.Still, for rooms this big, in this location, and particularly if the prices stay modest, this place is definitely worth consideration.

<Content>Big comfortable bed We spend 5 nights here in Feb 2007. The room was large and comfortable. There were many nice touches including- fridge, nice toiletries and large TV. We had a standard double with a hugh comfortable bed. The view was poor- we were on the 3rd floor at the back with the air con units, but I think that was bad luck. It didn't ruin the say. The lounge was comfortable and inviting and the wine and cheese a lovely touch. We mainly used it on the last day after checking out, meaning we could enjoy our last day knowing we ad somewhere warm to come back too.The staff were very helpful and welcoming.Several blocks east of rockafella centre it was a good base for exploring. Its not right in the centre of things but benefits from a quieter location.We wouldn't recommend the airport shuttle the hotel uses- very poor service from the driver.There is a nice cafe 3 doors down which does a nice breakfast/lunch.

<Content>Great hotel We just came back from New York City where we spent 3 nights at the Affinia 50. The rooms are quite spacious for New York and for the price. We had a king size bed, a fridge, and a coffee maker. The bathroom is a decent size, except it had only a vent and not a fan. Minor detail. The staff, the service, and the location are all wonderful. Many places to eat in the area, and close to all the major attractions. A great place for breakfast is the Morning Star Cafe, on 2nd Avenue and 50th Street. Would go back to this hotel next time in New York.

<Content>No Nonesense Central Hotel Booked this after consulting reviews and was not disappointed.Hotel is superbly located a few blocks from many of the major attractions. Booked standard double which was spacious with huge bed, writing desk, easy chair, table, fridge, coffee machine  widescreen t.v. with inroom entertainment system.Bathroom was also spacious with part sunk tub  power shower, complimentary Avida toiletries.Staff very helpful  library with free audio/map tour guide packs are available to guestsBedlinen, towels  room were spotless all of which should add up to 5/5Only down side preventing top marks was lack of a bar  noise levels (first time in NYC suspect it may always be noisey?).Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking corner of 50th st  3rd avenue, traffic noise  bin men made every morning an early one.Plenty of local restaurants nearby from Sushi to Tunisian  everything between.To make up for lack of bar there is free wine  cheese served in lounge from 6 - 7 p.m. but would benefit from a bar service beyond this time

<Content>Comfort and Convenience Although the Affinia 50 offers many services, it shines most brightly for the independent traveler looking for a comfortable, spacious, conveniently-located base in New York City -- not travelers looking to be pampered at every turn. The beds are great, Aveda toiletries distinctive, staff friendly and location excellent. You won't get unforgettable views, robes, a mini-bar or chocolates on your pillow, but (in a studio or suite) you will enjoy plenty of room to work or lounge, a kitchen to keep refreshments or that caviar you bought to take home, and wonderful linens to enhance your sweet dreams.

<Content>Just what you need for a great, up-to-date midtown hotel On 50th, between Lex and 3rd, the Affinia 50 feels brand new inside. Spacious rooms, clean and contemporary design. Having stayed in too many old, drab and worn out hotels in Manhattan, it was a delight to find everything new and clean - from the decor in the rooms to the equipment in the fitness center. It was a good valye at the rates we found through Expedia (in January - not exactly high season). I thought the $14 continental breafast was grossly overpriced, and with all the stores on 3rd and pubs on 2nd, the lack of in-hotel dining was not an issue.

<Content>Great place! Clean pleasant room, helpful friendly service, outstanding location. We were there over xmas weekend. No complaints. We didn't eat brkfst there, instead ate at nearby places such as Ess-a-bagel and Oms/b, both which we recommend. Agree that the pillow menu is a bit much. Hotel should just pick a pillow and stick with it. If someone complains, bring them something else. We'll return as long as the price is right (162/nite, no suite).

<Content>More Space Less Service We stayed at the Affinia 50 the last week of December including New Years Eve. Two adults, two children in a one bedroom suite.Pros: really large room, two queens in the bedroom and a pull out in the living room, great comfy beds, prompt maid service and good location.Cons: all the common areas are really small (really small) with low celings and everything needs a good scrub, thankfully we were on the 6th floor because we took the stairs (even at checkout w- 4 suitcases) most of our stay, the 2 elevators are very slow, the front desk seems overwhelemed and put out, could not make change for larger bills or arrange for cars, we only saw the door man once during our stay (but was very helpful that one time) and don't even try the coin op laundry, it's just plain scary.I will mention we did not get a deal, we paid $398.00 a night, not again.

<Content>NYC Home Stayed at this hotel in midtown Manhattan just after New Years during the recent heat wave. Hotel was clean and price was decent for this quality hotel in NYC. Since we stayed more than 3 nights we got an additional 20% off through Expedia. Room was 2 large beds with a small Kitchenette. One day when we returned the doorman said welcome home. Our room on the seventh floor had some minor things such as a bedlight missing from one of the beds (had obviously been ripped out) and the temperature controls didn't seem to have much effect. The staff was very helpful when asked about directions or any of our needs. My only real complaint was that the shampoo and conditioners were not replenished the first night and neither was the coffee. Both of these items were quickly remedied when I brought it to their attention. The room was a little loud from street noise. Their is a club of some type right nest door that must be popular since draws crowds late at night. Beds were very comfortable and all in all would stay here again. Location is excellent with Subway nearby and within easy walking distance of 5th avenue stores and Rockefeller Center.

<Content>Mixed but overall good value I stayed at the Affinia 50 the first week in January. The room was booked through Hotels.com and had rates ranging between $140 and $190 during my stay. I spent one weekend night at a sister property - The Benjamin - which may be why I was a bit disappointed in my experience at Affinia 50. Don't get me wrong, overall it's a very nice hotel and a good value for the money. The location can't be beat at 50th and Third- close to the subway, walkable to shopping and museums and the midtown business area. I arrived around 1pm (2 hours before the 3pm check-in). The hotel was obviously busy, but I asked if I could check in early and the person at the reception told me to go up to their 2nd floor lounge (nice place to to hang out, have breakfast or a cocktail) to wait and they would get me when a room was ready. I was there over an hour (much longer than I would have expected when I was there waiting...). If one of the managers hadn't come by and noticed I was still there, I'm not sure how long I would have been kept waiting. When I finally got into my room I was pleasantly surprised by the large (by NYC standards) room with its modern updates. The room faced out to the corner of 50th and 3rd but was surprisingly quiet. With the exception of the initial front desk experience, service at the hotel is friendly, quick and professional. I appreciated the in-room safe and the small refrigerator.Overall I would recommend the hotel as a very good value for the money and a nice change from large chain hotels.

<Content>This is how hotels should be. Every time I stay at an Affinia property I am more and more impressed. The rates were fantastic for midtown (granted early January is not the hot tourist season, but it was unseasonably warm - in the 60's and 70's) and the valet parking reasonable. The room was comfy and clean and the memory foam pillow I requested was in the room when I checked in.The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, the bathroom clean and well appointed and the walls soundproof.Without question, the strong point of all the Affinia Hotels I've stayed in is the service. The staff of the Affinia 50 is welcoming, personable and unobtrusive. This is how hotels should be.

<Content>A Great Stay We stayed in a standard room with a queen size bed. Room was relatively large. Bed was VERY comfortable. We sampled some of the pillows from their pillow menu and found that the buckwheat pillows made for an amazing night's sleep. Room was spotlessly clean with an upscale feel, nice Aveda toiletries, good quality towels, CD player onthe nightstand, nice TV, comfortable work area, and an especially-welcome, small refrigerator to store our own food (rather than a mini-bar with overpriced things we don't want.) The helpful and knowledgeable doormen were not always present, but when they were, we were greeted with a Welcome Home and a Cheers. The complimentary wine and cheese in the club room was nice on weekday evenings. The concierge was helpful with restaurant recommendations. The exercise room had high-end equipment and was clean and well-maintained and had a shower and changing room. The staff was efficient and cheerful. Location is very central (a block and a half from the 4,5,6 subway). As long as the price is right, I'd like to stay here again.

<Content>Amazing hotel!!!! I picked the Affinia chain because of the amazing reviews on TripAdvisor and was not at all disappointed. We ( 2 adults, 2 kids, 12 and 15) stayed in a Junior Suite, with 2 queen beds. Tons of room, and not just by New York standards. Beautifully finished, great beds, comforters and terrific bathroom and toiletries. Room to set up your computer on a rather large desk and a very useful, but very small kitchen, with a stove, fridge, sink, dishware, pots, toaster, microwave all supplied. Only issue is that if you are plannin on eating in a Junior Suite, there is not really anywhere to sit around a table. There is a chair and ottoman and then the beds. Great TV, tons of storage. Great and helpful staff. We were a bit worried about the location at 50th and 3rd, but no concerns. Walked to the theatres in about 20 minutes. Also very close to at least 2 subway stops. We got a great deal by taking a non-refundable rate from the hotel's website itself and saved a bunch of money. In short....stay here...you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Very well located Three of us stayed at the hotel over Christmas for 5 nights in a one-bedroom apartment. The hotel is very well situated on E50th and Third in Midtown. The apartment was clean, spacious and very comfortable. As we had a kitchen we ate breakfast in the apartment so are unable to comment on the breakfasts on the Club floor. There is a supermarket a block away and the area is well served with diners and restaurants. The concierge service was excellent and the reception staff and doormen friendly and helpful. We would certainly use the hotel next time we are in New York.If you can't face the huge museums try the Frick which has an amazing collection of European art and is relatively small.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Highly Recommend Stayed at the Affinia 50 on Dec 30 + 31, 2006. First time in New York. Great location, nice clean rooms, extremely friendly staff. Room size was pretty big considering what I had read about small rooms in NY. Would definately stay there again. Thanks to all for the helpful reviews, it is because of this site we booked there. Only complaint would be the shower didn't drain fast enough so you stand in ankle deep water, but I understand this is quite common in these re-done hotels.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful stay at the Affinia 50! We had a one night stay at the Affinia 50 on Christmas night. Arrived late, but were welcomed with open arms and no wait. We had a one bedroom suite booked, and had requested queen beds. Suite was exactly as requested; queens and the sofabed made up. The suite was quiet, extremely comfortable - so much so we didn't want to leave the beds in the morning! Valet worked great for the car. We checked out and they were happy to hold our bags while we visited the city. Called about 30 minutes before returning and the car and bags were waiting for us. Can't say enough good things about this hotel. Great for families - we were traveling with two teenagers and it was great. Great location - even a Starbucks on the corner. Would not stay anywhere else in Manhattan.

<Content>We loved it! We stayed at the Affinia 50 for one night - Dec 22 to 23rd - the very busy, last weekend before Christmas. Our stay here was a pleasant surprise. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. It is particularly nice for business travelers or families who want larger, suite-type accommodations.We learned about the hotel through a low rates type travel e-mail, and booked a King bed + sofabed room for a very good rate. Upon arriving, the reception staff discovered we had children with us and immediately upgraded us to a HUGE corner suite. We didn't even ask! No extra charge! The suite was amazing - clean and HUGE. Separate kitchen area with a stove, fridge/freezer, microwave, dishwasher, dishes, etc. Enormous living room area with the pull-out sofa already made up for our kids and 19th floor City views along two walls. Eating area with a dining table that sat four. Plenty of closet and drawer space - even a small walk-in closet. Our kids thought they were movie stars, the place was that nice. Our bedroom was equally spacious and well appointed. Large screen TVs in both rooms and high end grooming products in the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the rooms were quiet. The Website description and photos really didn't do the place justice. Every staff member that we encountered was very polite and nice, and even apologized for getting on to the elevator with us. We did not have to wait to check in, check out, check our baggage, or get an elevator. And as I mentioned previously, this was peak Christmas season in NYC - we anticipated large crowds, long waits and plenty of rude NY citizens and staff. We encountered none of these. If I need to find any flaws with this establishment (and I really have to think hard...) I would say that there was a little bit of water damage in the bathroom, but nothing that affected the cleanliness of it - there was no mildew or antiquated bathtub caulk - and the bathroom was on the smaller size. But in NYC, I expect things to be a little on the efficient, space-saving side. The other thing I noted was that the cabinets in the kitchen were on the low-budget side, but I was so tickled to even have a kitchen in my suite, I really didn't care! I did not take note of the decor; everything seemed tastefully done to me and the furniture was of nice quality; nothing stood out as old or tacky.The location is IDEAL. It is a couple of blocks from Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's, Radio City, the great shopping on Fifth Avenue, etc. We had 9AM tickets for the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City, and all we had to do was walk out the front door, turn right, walk 4 blocks and enter Radio City. The location made it easy for us to walk to the Sony Wonder Technology Lab  Museum and the Museum of Modern Art (both wonderful attractions and free on Friday nights!) There are great restaurants at all price levels and cuisine types a block away from the hotel, and even a McDonald's around the corner. If you drive into the City, the hotel offers valet parking at competitive rates, or there are lots on 50th or 51st streets. There is a subway station very close by, so you really don't need a car to get around.Again, I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. It is particularly nice for business travelers or families who want larger, suite-type accommodations.

<Content>Wonderful Stay in Midtown We stayed 3 nights and 4 days at the Affinia 50 Hotel. This was our first trip to NYC and we had heard stories on how the hotels were small and not worth the money. This was not the case at Affinia 50. The room was excellent! We had plenty of space and the decor was modern and tasteful. The staff at the Affinia 50 were very helpful. The bell service set up shuttles for us, the concierge was very helpful in setting us up at restaurants and telling us about the attractions. We did have to ask for fresh wash cloths one day but they were brought up right away with an apology for them missing. The lounge area at the hotel was very nice and comfy too. Whenever we got back at the end of a long day we were greeted with a smile and a warm Welcome Home. I would definately go back to the Affinia 50 for our next trip to NYC. This is a great stay for anyone!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Having been to New York before and stayed in various types of hotels, this tops them all and is definitely worth a visit.Its location is great and means you can easily walk to most of the major sights. With 5th Avenue a block up this also makes shopping very easy. For sights a little further away (or if you don't like walking too far) tube statations are near by.The rooms were exceptionally clean and the Aveda products in the bathrooms were a nice touch.From the moment you arrive at this hotel you are made to feel very welcome. The concierge guys were amazing and were always happy to help, as were the staff on reception.Great value for money and a great stay.

<Content>One of the best in NYC! We just returned from another trip to NYC and were'nt able to stay at the Affinia 50 as they were booked. I'm compelled to write today because the quality of the Affina 50 vs. the On The Ave hotel are glaring.The Affina is somewhat dated in it's decor, but the staff and the size of the rooms more than make up for that! The staff just could not be more wonderful and the other services provided were fantastic.When we arrived at the Affinia 50 we were exhausted by a difficult trip with just about everything gone wrong. The staff made us feel like we were home, but with a great staff.We love that place and can't wait to get back.

<Content>Smashing place Cannot recommend the Affinia 50 highly enough. Once again, Tripadvisor's reviewers are bang on with the ratings. Three of us stayed at the Affinia from 30 Nov to 4 Dec 2006. I booked back in May; knowing December was peak season, and reserved a junior suite, but on arrival we were upgraded to an enormous suite on the 14th floor because one of us was celebrating a birthday. You'd easily have slept six people in it. There were two large double beds in the bedroom and the living area had two sofas, one of which folded out into a double bed. It also had a dining table to seat 4. The rooms were spotlessly clean and well-equipped; two large TVs, separate kitchen with dishwasher and large fridge-freezer, and bathroom with (an admittedly small, but we didn't mind) bath and lovely fixtures and Aveda cosmetics. Hairdryer, iron and ironing board also provided. Staff were incredibly helpful; the doormen and receptionists were obliging and pleasant, and the concierge in the second floor club lounge, Tanya, was brilliant - organised tickets for sightseeing tours and also managed to get tickets to a sold-out show for us. Location great - less than 10 minutes' leisurely walk to the Rockefeller center, and very close to Saks, Bloomingdales, and Fifth and Madison Avenues. We walked everywhere - didn't need to use the subway and only got taxis when going to the Port Authority or airport.The Affinia doesn't have a restaurant (it serves breakfast in the club room, but we didn't indulge), but there are plenty of dining options nearby. The New York Luncheonette two doors up does great breakfasts (you might have to queue to get in for a few minutes at weekends but it's worth it), and Ferro's Italian restaurant further up in the Kimberly hotel wasn't bad. I gather Smith and Wollensky's steakhouse down the street is great but we didn't make it there. If I had to find a negative it would be that there was a bit of noise from aircon units outside the windows, but it didn't bother us at all after the first night. Also, you might have to wait a few minutes for the lifts at check-in/check-out times. All in all, a great stay. I would book it again without hesitation.

<Content>Brilliant!!!!! What a lovely hotel. This was our first time in NY and we cant wait to go back. We arrived on Fri 1st Dec around 5.30pm, to find our room wasn't ready, all though we only had to wait around 10 mins i would of expected us to be able to go straight in. Never the less the reception were lovely, they made us welcome with friendly smiles and the door men are brilliant. They are really helpful and will get you taxis, book helicopters flights, do anything you need - obviously they expect a tip after!! But they make the stay all the better.We had booked a king size suite and that it was!! It was massive. The front room was huge with dining table at the end of it. The tv was gigantic! The kitchen was small and dated but then we only used it for the fridge and kettle. We weren't planning on eating in any night! The bathroom again is small but lovely and clean. The bedroom was huge. The bed was gigantic and could of fit 4 of us!!! It was so comfy i didn't want to get out. We had loads of cupboards/wardrobes space. We faced out onto the street which we loved. All though u can here the traffic late at night we didn;t mind as we wanted to watch it all going on. If your a light sleeper then i;d ask for a room at the back if noise bothers you. We'd had a few drinks before going to bed so we slept through it. Mon - Thurs they have free wine, coffee etc on the 2nd floor which is a nice touch, all though we didn't go there.This hotel is in a great location for anyone to get about NY city. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant like most of them dont, but with the cafe a few doors down delivering to the hotel free of charge your sorted for breakfast. We would def come back and stay at this hotel and recommend it to anyone

<Content>Excellent Location !!! The Affinia 50 was a very pleasant place to stay for a long weekend in the Big Apple. The location is excellent, 50th and 3rd Ave is a nice part of the Upper East Side. The subay was quite close and Rockefeller Center just down the street. The Guestroom was spacious and mine included a mini fridge. Thank goodness it did not have one of those sensor activated minibars that I think should be outlawed! The Living Room on the second floor ( right down from my Guestroom) was a nice place...had free coffee and tea and a computer with the internet to check email and bank balances ( NYC is expensive! ) . I would definitely reconsider staying here again, but hopefully at less than 350 a night. But Christmas time is always expensive in NYC.

<Content>Beyond expectations! First time to NYC from Australia. Found the hotel through Tripadvisor website. Beyond our expectations! Two huge luxurious beds for the four of us, AND a loungroom and kitchen! Two TV's which made the kids (and us) happy ( they could watch telly in the other room)We had a huge corner room, and one extra bonus which people should know is that it had a safe in the room for locking up valuables. Sid at the front desk was fantastic! Great restaurants close by. We all loved this place and we are already planning our return trip to NYC to stay at the Affinia 50!

<Content>Affinia wonderful We have just returned from The Affinia and it exceeded expectations. We stayed in a Queen room on the 5th floor, we didn't have a street view but as we were in New York to sight see this didn't bother us. The room was clean, the bed was soooo comfortable the bed linen was lovely and crisp, we didn't bother with the pillow menu as the ones we had were comfy enough. The bathroom was small but spotless. It was wonderful to have a fridge to keep drinks cool and also a coffee maker, (not often found in New York hotel rooms). All the staff were helpful especially the doormen who always greeted us with a smile. We would definitely use this hotel again.

<Content>Huge rooms; good stay; great with kids Good: Family (2 adults and 2 kids) stayed in 1 bedroom suite there this weekend. Overall, a great stay. The rooms were huge. Really, for New York, HUGE. The beds were comfortable and the linens were nice. The location is good--very close to the subway, walking distance to many good restaurants and sites, and safe. We had an interior room with a bit of a dismal view (backs of other hotels) but on the 12th floor it was super quiet. We were also on an end and heard virtually no other guests. The staff was nice and responsive--especially the doormen.Bad: The kitchen was comically dated. It had metal cabinets that barely opened! The dishwasher was 10 years old, at least. However, it was functional. It had 4 dishes, cups, etc. You wouldn't want to cook in it, but it was fine for feeding the kids and warming up take out. Also the rooms were warm as the heating is not per-unit controlled and NYC was unseasonably warm.Overall: I'd stay there in a second with kids. For adults, you could probably find somewhere a little cooler or more romantic for the same money but for a family the huge rooms and kitchen were great.

<Content>Friendly staff and great location Stayed at the Affinia 50 for 9 nights in late October - early November 2006. It is in a great location, the rooms are a good size  clean and the staff were very friendly. We were in a room facing 50th street and it was very noisy due to renovations being done on the building across the road every night from about 11 pm to 5 am so I would recommend a room without a view. The concierges and room cleaning staff were very friendly and helpful. The desks taff should follow their example as they are a little on the curt side. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>just as good as expected! I stayed here from 10/27/06-10/30/06 with three other women and had a standard room w/two beds. It's very small, but was very, very clean. The beds were very comfortable (for a hotel)  i didnt feel scared to sleep on them. The staff was also very curteous. Another good thing about it is that it's only a 20 min walk (or so) to times square/broadway, which is cool if it's your first time to see all the lights! We went to see Evil Dead the musical (which was excellent!)  we were also able to walk there. Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because room was so small  we were in room 211 which is in a weird area by the lounge  fitness room  elevator so we heard the elevator  people all night long. This only bothered me 'cause i'm a light sleeper. If your a heavy sleeper wouldnt bother you as it didnt the people i was with. Just avoid this room! Would definitely recommend for small groups travelling on a budget!

<Content>Loved the Affinia 50 My niece and I planned a trip to the American Girl Store in NYC. By the time we traveled (Oct 12-16), her mom  my son and his wife had joined us and we needed a suite. The AGS recommended the Affinia as a partner with them. The Hotel was close to the store, Grand Central and St. Patrick's Cathredal. We were impressed with the men at the door who made us very comfortable, were willing to talk to us and were very informative.Our only complaint was that the hotel was out of beds for the dolls that travelled with us - we did find that the oversized, beautiful burgundy pillows worked well for their bed. The hotel also gave us a choice of pillows that we could request and comfortable beds. We were close to the subway and to eateries for a quick lunch or a very late snack. We were impressed with the small kitchen that had everything we needed for our leftovers as well as a corkscrew. All of us will plan to stay there on our next trip to NYC.

<Content>Loved the Price and Accommodations at the Affinia 50 Hitting peak season in NYC can be very expensive. I stayed at the Affinia 50 on 3rd and 50th since the Grand Hyatt was charging $550 for a standard room (ridiculous)...I found the accomodations at the Affinia 50 were 100% better than I ever expected. I loved the in-room kitchen complete with flatware, tableware, including wine glasses!!! Also included were a refrigerator, microwave, stove etc. The hotel offers Aveda soaps, shampoo and conditioner which was a nice touch. Honestly, if you compare standard room to standard room the Affinia 50 makes the Hyatt look like a 2 star hotel...The front desk was friendly and very accommodating! Would definitely do the Affinia 50 again! Only bad thing was the street noise I was in room 804 and the noise from 3rd Avenue mainly sirens and cars honking...Well welcome to Manhattan... ;o)

<Content>Definitely a good choice! I was guided by the reviews on trip advisor for this stay, and it was definitely not a disappointment! The location is great, very central - near to bus and subway - and is relatively quiet at night. Lots of things are within walking distance - Times Sq, Central Pk, Fifth Ave, Broadway, etc. The location feels very safe at night.The room was very nice - very large compared to what we expected! Staff are very pleasant and friendly, always willing to help. The club room with the evening cheese and wine was nice and relaxing before heading out for the evening.I would definitely recommend this hotel - it's probably better value if you have a large party. The junior suite would comfotably fit 6 girlfriends for instance if you are looking for a nice location near to all the attractions, and are willing to share a (large) double bed!

<Content>great hotel We stayed here for 8 nights in oct 06, we had a gorgeous junior suite room (2 of us)n lots of space, didn't use the sofa bed as a bed tho' what with the fantastic double bed they provided us with. Huge mirror which was great for getting ready in the evenings! Bathroom was a bit small and kitchen even smaller, but to be fair we did'nt use the latter. The fact that the bathroom was equally gorgeous (with Aveda goodies) and clean more than made up for the lack of size. Room on the whole was v.clean and furniture in great condition- had a nice view too.We were on the 14th floor and during the night you could here some noise but on the whole it was not loud enough to be troublesome.For breakfasts try the yummy Pax around the corner or also Ess-a-bagel next door to it!51st street tube is one a block away; have to say the hotel could not be in a better location, this is my fourth time to New York and I have to say the city is small enough to be easily navigated by all means of transport (including by foot)The staff are absolutely lovely and very helpful, one last thing do not end your stay without visiting Whiskey Blue bar in the W hotel (around the corner)- really nice!

<Content>Great location, comfortable large rooms Arrived in New York on 6th Oct for 3 nights at the Affinia 50 hotel. Arrived at Newark and pre-booked Blue Van transfer which is reasonable priced and good service, just got to 鈥済round transport desk鈥?when you arrive and they do the rest. Booked a suite at the hotel, great room could not fault it in any way, the separate lounge and kitchen area was a god send, especially if you get a bit of jet lag and up at 3am. Hotel is in a good location and many attractions can be walked to, also the metro is 5 mins walk. Metro can be a little confusing at first but you will soon get into it.We did not have breakfast in the hotel as many cheaper places around the area. There is no bar at the hotel, which is a shame, but a nice club lounge area with complimentary tea and coffee all day. You can get a 鈥渨alking tour鈥?kit from the hotel, which is a really good idea (maps, CDs, books, water container etc all in a small back pack)Just a word of warning we had a few items stolen from our bags during our return journey, cannot be sure at what point they went missing!! But keep this in mind!!

<Content>Not what I expected Having never been to New York before, I (sadly) assumed the worst about the hotel accommodations. Business travelers had warned me about the room sizes and even suggested I pack light because there wouldn't be room for anything extra. Imagine my surprise when I checked into the Affinia 50 with three girlfriends this summer for a girls-only weekend! It is a beautiful hotel with lovely, roomy accommodations, fantastically comfortable beds, a pillow menu (in case you're super picky) and a very friendly staff. They were always ready to answer our questions and seemed happy to be there, even long past midnight when we'd return half asleep from our nightly excursions. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Location, cozy We were greeted every time we entered with a smile from both the doorman and desk staff. We have a family of 5, 3 teenage boys and stayed in a jr. suite (810). The room had 2 queen beds, pull out sofa, all were quite comfortable. We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the entire room including the kitchen. There was plenty of room for storage of clothing. The subway is a 5 minute walk. I will stay in Affinia 50 every time I'm in NYC. CONVENIENT!!!

<Content>Good 'Cheers' My family of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens spent 2 nights at the Affinia 50 recently. While not luxiourious, the amenities that mattered were right on and service was always very friendly, served with a smile, a tip of the hat from the bellman and a good day Cheers. (my suburban-raised teen wanted to know why the bellmen were wearing cowboy hats. They were 50's style fedora's, which, the bellman explained, used to be a sign of a well-dressed man.) We used the valet parking service ($44/day for a minivan) which was very convenient. The room was a one bedroom apt. with a full kitchen. Two gloriously comfortable queen beds in the spacious bedroom, a sleep sofa in the large living room with plenty of room for a comfy cot. The unit could easily have slept 7 people (although the hotel might not want that). The kitchen still had its old metal cabinets, but was very clean and adequate for simple meal preps. Upscale Aveeda toiletries. The 2nd level club floor is open to all and features couches, large TVs, free newspapers and a continental breakfast (which should be skipped; go to Ess-a-Bagel on 3rd between 50th and 51st instead - great NY bagels served up by the gruff/funny/endearing staff; 4 bagels with toppings and drinks for the price of one continental breakfast). My only other (minor) grip with not having free Internet service. But all-in-all, a great little hotel for families doing NYC for the weekend.

<Content>Excellent value and location Arrived and was pleased by the friendly reception staff. Smallish lobby is smart and topped off by a steel waterfall originating in the Club Room on the floor above.The Affinia website isn't particulary clear, I thought this was an all suite hotel, but it isn't. I had a standard queen room. I was expecting a small kitchen but there wasn't one. No problem though.The room was a good size, especially for New York, and the fittings were of a 3* or 4* standard. Good sized bathroom with marble surfaces. Aveda products are excellent.Good sized closet (although, as a man, I ignored it and lived out of my bag).Bed was exceptionally comfortable with a pillow top mattress (basically a layer of pillow padding across the mattress). There is a slightly gimmicky pillow menu where one can choose from three of four pillow options. Again, I am male, and was staying alone, so ignored, it.I didn't use the Club Room so can't comment. Don't go for the $14 breakfast (not included in room rates). There are a million places in Manhattan to go for a better (and better value) breakfast. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but there IS room service from a restaurant (MINT) across the street.I was in room 405. This was obviously on the 4th floor. You can hear some noise from 3rd avenue, but it didn't bother me. The view from rooms on this side of the hotel isn't that great - just a brick wall. I could see 3rd avenue at an angle, but again, no real problem.Location is excellent. Turn right out of the hotel and 10 mins later you are at the Rockerfeller Center, 15 mins and you are just north of Times Square. Great deli around the corner to the right outside the hotel, or a larger supermarket (Associated) on Second Avenue (south a bit).I booked this as part of a deal with flight from the UK, so I couldn't see the hotel price, but I expect it was about $150 - $200. At that price it's great value. Don't hesitate to book this hotel if you can get it at less than $250 a night.

<Content>great for a family As far as NYC hotels go, this one is average, or above average, but I rated it excellent because it could meet the needs of our family of five. It has several suite options which include a sofa bed and the kitchen was an added bonus. I booked through AAA because it would give me an option of what turned out to be the junior suite for $288, while the Affinia website would only put 5 people in a one bedroom suite for $405. While this would still be a pretty good deal for NYC, I was happy to save the extra money. The staff was especially polite and helpful. We would definately stay there again.

<Content>Great location and ammenities but pricey My family stayed at the Affinia 50 September 23 - 28th. It was me, my husband, daughter 16 and son 12. We had the 1 bedroom suite. It included 2 queen beds and a pull out bed. It also had the kitchenette, 2 closets, safe, couch, etc. This was plenty of room for us and it worked out well. Everything was very clean and nice. Very few, minor issues like not providing enough towels to not turning down the fold-out bed the first night only, but the rest of the time they were spot on.What I loved about this hotel was its great location in midtown. So easy to get everywhere around Manhattan. I also have to give big kudos to the door staff. They were so friendly and helpful and I felt like I was leaving family as they waved as we went home in our taxi.Although this hotel was a bit pricey, I don't feel bad about spending the money. I think it was worth it. We definitely used the kitchenette to have breakfast, snacks and soda on hand which was a big deal for us. There was a little market a couple of blocks away and a very small store just a few hundred feet down for emergencies.We will recommend this hotel to our friends and family due to its location, friendly staff and the added benefit of the kitchenette and space for families.

<Content>Very Nice - But Expensive Stayed at the Affinia 50 for business. Paid more than $600/night because there was nothing else available. Room was very large and comfortable. Had a living room, kitchenette, bedroom and large bathroom. Only downside was the low-flow shower that had very little water pressure. Plenty of space to work and the high-speed internet was terrific for $10/day. Overall, loved the room.The lobby and hallways are nothing special - very small, narrow and cramped -- but the staff is wonderful. From the minute that the doorman greets you with a tip of his cap until the time that you leave the hotel, the service is great.The location is perfect. Right off of Lexington and convenient to most everything in NY. Went running in Central Park early in the morning and it was about a 5 minute job to get there. The restaurants in the area are terrific. Very diverse selections -- from fast food all the way to high-end five-star cuisine. Times Square is a relatively short cab ride away and cost only $8 to get there. The subway also is very close (around the corner).NY is pricey throughout the city, so saving money may be difficult, but if you can get a good price for this hotel, you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Small room, smaller bathroom The reviewers who wrote about the nice size of the rooms didn't stay in one of the guest rooms. I'm sure the suites are very nice, but the guest room is so small you have to close all the dresser drawers in order to get between the dresser and the bed. The bathroom was also tiny. You had to close the bathroom door just to have enough space to use the facilities and there was no shelf or countertop space. The room was clean and the staff was helpful, although I did have to call housekeeping twice to get a pillow from their pillow menu. The Club Room is very nice and the club concierge was wonderful. Be aware that the breakfast they serve in the Club Room is not included and is quite pricey for a glorified continental breakfast. It is clean, trendy and well located, but I was a little disappointed.

<Content>Overrated! My husband and I chosed the Affinia last week, because the reviews were simply unbelievable. The hotel is so-so, nothing to rave about. We paid $520(exc tax) a nite, only to get a note in the morning, there will be no water from 11am-2pm! If there was scheduled maintenance work, they should inform us when we checked in, but the excuse was .. 'oh, but we left a note under your door this morning'. I ll say, unless it was dirt cheap deal, go for it. For $520, it was certainly dissappointing for us.

<Content>Excellent Stay  The Affina 50 was a really nice hotel. The website pictures were accurate. The room was the right size. The bathroom however was a little small, but really cute. the bed was cozy and comfortable and I wish I had their pillows at my own home. The only thing we had a problem with was that our room was to close to the club room and the concierge desk. There was a lot of noise and activity in the hallway. Other than that, we would stay at the Affina 50 again. In fact, we are looking forward to visiting New York soon. We had a really great time in the city.

<Content>The Perfect wedding! We chose this hotel as the place to stay while we eloped to NYC. We were a bit nervous because we'd never heard of it and because we got a really low rate. The reveiws on here were so great, we decided to try it and WOW! what a surprise. The hotel employees made our stay so nice, we felt like VIP's everytime we spoke with one of them. The hotel was clean and nice. Love, the aveda products, btw! The location is great, it is close to restaurants and the touristy things of NY, but it is more residential so it feels more new yorky. We preferred this location to where we'd stayed previously right in time square area. We will try to stay here every time we return to the city...they were so nice. (Oh and the beds.... mucho comfortable!!)

<Content>Sheer relief We booked Affinia 50 because it got such great reviews. Our journey to NY from London was marred by the terrorist threats over translatlantic flights - and the sheer relief of arriving in one piece was greatly increased by the warm welcome, and the very comfortable, spacious and quiet room we were given. The room was huge by normal hotel standards - and the beds were a delight. Best of all, in a noisy city, we faced the back (not a great view) and had no noise. Only drawback was that the airconditioning could not be adjusted or turned off and it did get quite cold sometimes. There is a diner just steps away for breakfast and a 24 hour supermarket round the corner. My son has already asked to stay there again if we return to NY- - which we will!

<Content>Large room for Manhattan - uite good overall The room was larger than your typical NYC boutique hotel room and it was very clean and modern. Beds are very comfy with nice bedding. The hallways are nothing fancy and the property lacks a restaurant, bar or pool however the breakfast/happy hour area on the 2nd floor is quite nice and the neighborhood is chock full of places for drinks and eating. Great location. Overall pretty good! Was not disappointed. A bit pricy but delivered on a good amount of classiness in general.

<Content>Comfy beds, clean hotel, great location First time to NYC, stayed at the Affinia 50 for six nights Aug-Sept. We had one of the 'cheap' room rates, 1-4 floors. No kitchenette like the description claimed, but it did have a small fridge. Did not bring it to their attention, as we were a night away from leaving. Book through AAA if you can, that way you get the best rate and you can always cancel. Just remodeled, nice rooms, best beds ever- that is important. Yes you will have to get your room key activated if you stay more than a few nights- happened here a few times, and in Boston- I think its an east coast thing..Great location, in my opinion. Would stay there again- for the price it can't be beat. All other hotels with good reviews were over $200 a night. Waldorf is a block away, if you want to spend over $400 a night. Here is my review/advice for those interested in details:Location was great. If you want a more quiet neighborhood at night, the outside is low on noise, except for cabs always honking. If you are looking for food in the a.m. McDonald's is on 3rd, literally 30 seconds away.DO NOT go to the breakfast place on 50th, the Luncheonette I think. Overpriced and the menu is misleading. We thought ten dollars, charged 20...fine print on the menu...Ugh.Ess-a-bagel (across from McD's) is great, busy in the a.m. but worth it for a cheap breakfast that will last till lunch time. Fabulous Mexican restaurant on 2nd Ave. Its a must. Mariachi band is great. Food is great. St. Bart's Church (on your way to Rock), great outdoor dining for dinner. Less than five minute walk.Subway is on 51st  Lexington, two minute walking distance. Starbucks is also right there. Always, always, always, carry a subway map and learn how to use it.Also invest in a Manhattan map so you get acquainted with how the streets work. They are VERY handy.Rockefeller Center is about a ten minute walk. Cab ride to Columbus Circle was $10, I think. Cab ride from JFK to Manhattan is a flate $45 plus bridge toll of $4.50If you like walking, Chrysler building is not too far. Ended up at the Empire State building, and Grand Central. Use the subway for Soho, Little Italy, Macys, Statue of Liberty, Ground Zero. It drops you off at all those places.-The doorman was the best part of the staff, always smiles and friendly. Housekeeping was noisey in the morning, and the slamming of doors will definitely wake you up.-Made it back for wine/cheese hour only once time, but it was great and relaxing.-We had a smaller room, huge king bed, but no complaints about the size since there were only 2 of us. -Bathrooms are SMALL. The faucet is ridiculous, couldn't wash my face without getting water everywhere. -Street noise was noticeable, but not as noticeable as the loud housekeeping early in the morning! I guess that is with all hotels though. Plus its NYC, cars are honking all day and all night!If its your first time, bring a lot of money for touristy things. Everything costs money. Food is expensive. Plan on at least $60 for dinner/two people. Oh, and bring comfy shoes. I did a LOT of research before booking this hotel, and I was not disappointed. Keep checking the price, mine went down after booking so I called AAA and got the lower price. Overall, LOVE NYC and want to come back soon!

<Content>Wow! Our collective jaws dropped upon entering the room. It was massive and beautiful. We had just spent four nights at a wonderful Upper West Side hotel, but wanted to take a step up for a couple of nights. We were not disappointed. The location was great -- we were able to walk to see a show and there are a number of fine places to eat and drink nearby. The customer service was even better. We would stay here again at the proverbial drop of their logo hat!

<Content>Problem Resolved Our reservation was made a month in advance with Expedia. We are not accustomed to spending $400 a night, but wanted our stay to be special and we even paid more for the one bedroom suite. Upon check in at 3:30 in the afternoon we were told that a guest had extended their stay and a suite was not available. There were three of us and we planned on having our son use the pull out couch in the living room. I told them I failed to see why tjhey were making their problem my problem. WE WERE TOLD BY THE SUPERVISOR it would only be for one night and that they would reduce our rate by $100 for each night. No one ever asked our opinion. We made it clear that this would be our first and last stay with Affinia 50. We were asked to consider eating at their breakfast $14.95 each.After arriving in our room a new manager called to offer us the breakfast for free. A nice offer, but we were still unsatisfied with the change to our accomodations. We never tried the breakfast. Soon thereafter another call to offer us a free bottle of wine. I told them it was not necessary, although they insisted (we never got it). After returning from sightseeing at 5 pm the next day we stopped at the front desk to see what they were doing about the change to our room. We were then upgraded to an even nicer room than we originally booked. An aside, the Television in the bedroom caught on fire soon after we got in the room. It was quickly replaced.In the end we appreciated the extra effort to make us happy. Although we still don't get why someone could extend their stay at our expense. The hotel is nice and well situated in the city. The bellman/parking attendant was terrific. (His name is Rome). He even recommended a nice Italian restaurant in walking distance of the hotel.In the end we agreed we would return due to the efforts continually made to try and make up for their mistake as opposed to just shrugging their shoulder after an attempt or two.. Both nights were charged at $199. Often the best way to rate a hotel is by how they handle the problems.

<Content>A great stay at the Affinia 50 We stayed at this wonderful hotel with our two children and small dog. We ALL had a wonderful time in NYC, mostly thanks to the exceptional hospitality of the Affinia 50. Our room was very spacious, with lots of closet space and a handy full size kitchen. It was great to be able to buy breakfast at a grocery store (there are several within easy walking distance) and have a convenient breakfast in the room.The Affinia 50 is in a great neighbourhood. It's a short walk to 5th Ave, and Central Park, but also on the edge of where it starts to get quieter and more neighbourly. Staying there was a great combination of feeling at home, and having ready access to the major attractions of NYC.And the staff was extra friendly and obliging. They really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They also recommended some great restaurants in the neighbourhood.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Loved the Affinia 50! My girlfriend, now fiance, and I stayed at the Affinia 50 last November and absolutely loved it. I actually proposed to her at the hotel and Affinia was extremely instrumental in making things go as smoothly as possible. I contacted them prior to our visit, informed them of what I hoped to do, and they said no problem. They provided the rose petal turn down service and the manager personally placed the ring on the bed for me while we were out for dinner. SOOOOOO accomodating. The location is great, the service outstanding, and the beds are a dream. When we go back to NYC, the Affinia will be our top choice. Wish that it weren't quite as expensive but you only get engaged once (you hope). Thanks again to the Affinia 50 staff!

<Content>highly recommended I was suprised by some of the negative comments on the last few reviews for this hotel . We (my husband and I and two teenage children) stayed at the Affinia 50 in July. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our 15th floor suite was extremely clean and large enough for 2 queen beds and a rollaway bed for our second daughter, the bathroom was a good size and there was more than adequate closet space. The kitchen was usful, but not really necessary as there are so many places to eat nearby. As a previous reviewer said the beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept on (I have back problems and I'm very very fussy), we did reciveve a pillow menu but didn't bother to change. We had no problems with noise from banging doors or voices in corridoors and street noise was at a perfectly acceptable level for a busy city (again noise is an area about which we are a fussy family as we take particular care to be quiet ourselves). All the staff were extremely helpful giving us recommndations for things to do, places to go, places to eat and directions. Would definately stay here again.Highly recommend Ess-a-bagel across the street for breakfast, and the Smith and Wollensky grill (on 49th and 3rd) for excellent steak.

<Content>I love New York, and the Affinia I was in New York in october, 2005. I didn't remember if I wrote my review. Anyway just few lines to express my total satisfaction for this hotel. As reviews I read said Affinia 50 is a perfect location for your journey. Well located, midtown, near underground stop, near baggels shop and starbucks, close to a supermarket... all the facilites. We had a very beautiful room in the 10th floor. I think the name was junior suite. We had two enormous beds, a kitchen (perfect for preparing breakfast or dinner if you decide to rest a litlle), at least 30 square metres I think. Hotel staff was nice, although I didn't need them a lot, just for asking for an electric switch to charge my european mobile. Just for your interest, we use airport shuttle for a company (the blue shuttle I thing, 8 usd per person more or less and they pick you up at the airport and pick you from the hotel to the airport) and it's a good alternative to a taxi, and cheaper. Coming back to Affinia, I'm looking for bad things, the breakfast price, maybe? As I've said you have lot of chance in the surroundings. Apart from that, I will return to Affinia when I return to New York, the best place I've ever stayed.

<Content>Comfortable stay Great price and great location, plus the most comfortable hotel beds my family has ever slept on. Check in went very smooth and the staff were courteous. Was a little disappointed in the fact that we booked the hotel back in February and requested a high floor and only got the 10th floor. No view from our room but heard no street noise.Had a leak in our fridge and the air conidtioner needed service. Maintenance was very prompt and fixed the air conditioner but was unable to fix the fridge, but it was still in working condition. If this is your first time in New York be sure to visit Tanya on the second floor and she can help you with anything - meals, locations, etc...We never received a menu to select our pillow type but we probably wouldn't have changed. Like I mentioned before the beds were great.My husband and two kids were with me and we walked everywhere from the hotel - Time Square and Central Park - so location was great.For meals be sure to eat at Pescatore's for great Italian (not too expensive) on 2nd. Tanya can give directions.Would I stay here again when we come back to New York - Absolutely!!! I highly recommend this hotel. I am so happy I found this thanks to tripadvisor.com.

<Content>Good location, clean comfortable rooms...but loud I recently spent 4 nights at the Affinia 50. We had booked a room with two queen beds and upon arriving discovered they had overbooked and only had a room with one king bed. We were offered a discount on the room rate so that was nice. The room was clean, nice sized, and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel is only a couple of streets away from the subway so that is also a plus. The only complaint I had was the noise, and not the noise coming from the street. The doors to the rooms slam shut (even when you attempt to close them gently). You would think that with such heavy doors it would block out a lot of the hallway noise but that is not the case at all. I could hear every word that was said in the hallway by other guests and the maid service. Other than that it was a great place - just not for sleeping past 8am.

<Content>An adequate hotel This is advertised as an executive suite hotel and as such is oversold. The website is a perfect example of how carefully chosen photographs and sufficient hype can oversell a hotel. The rooms were adequate in size but the bathroom was tiny. The clothes closets were open with no doors as was the kitchen. The kitchen had chipped worktops, a grubby fridge and units that looked as though they were meant for a garage rather than an executive suite hotel.The room had seen better days and not only needed redecorating but was also not very clean. There were marks on the walls and stains on the carpet made you feel uncomfortable about walking across the room in bare feet.The location was good and the front door staff were excellent. However, if you are looking for an executive suite hotel in New York I suggest you look further than this barely adequate hotel.

<Content>Better Than Expected Thanks, TripAdvisor! I studied reviews of many hotels in New York, choosing the Affinia Colletion because it offered suites. Our family of 8 adults, which included an 84 year-old aunt  90 year-old mother, needed room for two wheelchairs,  lots of luggage. We chose a 1 bedroom  2 bedroom suite. Fabulous 2 bedroom suite on the 17th floor - more floor space than imagined, with big bedrooms, great kitchen  lounging area, all clean  tastefully decorated. In the midst of the heat wave, we could not wait to get back to our room for the comfort. Great staff - always cheerful  helpful, particularly in procuring cabs. Responded quickly to requests for extra anything. Pleasant to have the kitchen facilities, as we ate our breakfasts  several dinners in our suite. Not difficult to walk to Times Square, UN, Grand Central Terminal, Empire State Bldg, St. Patrick's Cathedral,  Central Park (south entrance). Lots of restaurants within walking distance. Affinia 50 advertises as a business hotel, but it served our family superbly. We will use this hotel again.

<Content>Don't expect much from the staff The rooms were nice and comfortable, but the staff is not close to acceptable, I had a package delivered before I checked out, and even though I asked more than once at the front desk wether they had it or not, they always said nothing had arrived, now I have to have it picked up by an acquaintance in NYC. Also, the concierge was unavailable most of the time.

<Content>Great Hotel - Location Eh It is so hard to find a good hotel in NYC, when you're going in blind. My brother picked this hotel, he and his wife stayed in one room, my mom and I stayed in another. NYC hotel rooms are notoriously small, these were very generous, could easily have accommodated 2 more people and still not gotten in each other's way, Full bathroom, lots of room to put your toiletries down. You can request your choice of type of pillow! Good front desk, attractive lobby. Not happy that you had to pay like $8 for 15 minutes of computer time but maybe this is normal in the city? Only complaint but for me was a big one, was the location. It was a 20 minute walk to attractions, and had to cab it more than I would have liked. Aside from that, I would have stayed here again, when I visited the next month.

<Content>Good Hotel My daughter and I stayed for two weeks in July 06. The staff where good and always friendly. Our room was a guestroom and it was not bad very clean. We had a terrible view of some airconditioning units out of the window but thought hey we are here to see NY not look out the window.We would have been glad if we were offered a better room as we where staying for two weeks.If you need any bookings or advise see Tanya on the 2nd floor she is fantastic and nothing is ever to much trouble for her.Go around the corner and have a bagel for breakfast or visit Azzure and buy some excellent food.The area the hotel is in is pretty boring but it is so central to all attractions.Overall pretty good stay at the hotel.

<Content>Affinia 50 is terrific The hotel was superior at every touch point - from the moment we were greeted to riding up in the elevator with the doorman to plopping my head on your pillows for a great night sleep.Affinia 50 is terrific.

<Content>What a great place to stay. My wife and I stayed from July 1 to 5 and this hotel lived up to all our expectations and more. We arrived very late on Saturday night and were gives a large suite on the 8th floor....great room but I had asked for a view when making the booking and there was none. Next morning I approached Roy at reception and he was really nice about it. He said he would try to sort it out later that day when the rooms were vacated but then as soon as I got back to our room he rang and said that the bellboy was on his way to collect out things to take them to the penthouse....270 degree views from 3 balconies on the 22nd floor at no extra charge. Wow! All the staff at the hotel were equally friendly and helpful and did not always have their hands out for tips....The doormen are great and always had a few words with us as we passed them in the lobby or on the street outside the hotel. There are free drinks and cheese every week night from 6.00 to 7.00 on the 2nd floor which was unexpected and greatly appreciated as it gave us the chance to meet some of the staff and other guests. There are plenty of good restaurants only steps away but we mostly cooked for ourselves in our well equipped kitchen after buying the ingredients from an excellent supermarket that was only a block away. Times Square and Central Park are within easy walking distance but we bought metro passes so we often used the buses that pass the hotel every 10min to get to shows and boat cruises etc. The doorman organised our $20 each transfer to JFK airport which took the back roads and avoided long delays in the post July 4th traffic on the highway. This was our third visit to NY and our best hotel experience by far.

<Content>spacious, clean, friendly with style Our family of four stayed at the Affinia 50 for four days over the 4th of July holiday and loved it! We got a great rate ($199. for a junior suite) which made the stay even more agreeable. The suite was large, well outfitted, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The Club Room on the 2nd floor offered even more living space. We were able to relax and freshen up there after checking out since we had a late afternoon flight - and there's a workout room as well. Highly recommended!

<Content>" for a Big room in the Big Apple the Affina 50 can't be beaten!" Stayed at this hotel in May of this year and was delighted with my choice. Superb location, friendly helpful staff and very spacious rooms. Great value for money, will definately return. A real New York gem! The azzure deli round the corner on 3rd Avenue is not to be missed!

<Content>Definitely a Repeat! As a business traveler, I visit New York at least a dozen times a year. I have stayed at the Affinia 50 at least five or six times this year. Obviously, I would recommend staying here, as I have returned again and again. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Their trademark Cheers is a bit cheesy, but kind of cute.The rooms are much larger than most, although they do have at least a few rooms that are quite small. They range from extremely large with a kitchen (with a small stove, full fridge, etc.) to very small with a mini fridge inside an end table. The rooms are clean and well furnished with contemporary furuniture and luxurious bed linens. The bathrooms are small, but well appointed with Aveda toiletries. The alarm clocks are a pain to set, although they do honor their wake up calls. Their wine and cheese hour is a nice bonus and a good time to relax with business associates before dinner. A bit of variety would be nice as what is served doesn't change at all.The location is great, walking distance from Grand Central, Times Square, the UN and Park Avenue. The deli a couple of doors down is overpriced and mediocre, but the steakhouse next door next to the Kimberly is excellent. Definitely a great value. Will stay here many more times.

<Content>Is it really that good?? It was OK. Everything went pretty smoothly. The check in was efficient. Got a room on the 15th floor. I thought the room was huge, but I was in one of the smaller ones, judging by the evacuation map on the back of the door. Still, by New York standards, let's call it huge. The staff were pretty friendly, though by the time I left I was pretty sick of the word cheers Rate was good enough.The room was clean checking in and stayed that way throughout. No problem with the street noise.Can't really comment on the location, cause it can be good for some, bad for others. (Cabs are so cheap, who cares where it is.)If this hotel were in any other city, it wouldn't rate so high. However, given the space crunch in Manhattan, I have to give an extra star for the room size.

<Content>Loved the Affinia 50 We just got home from an amazing weekend in the city. The Affinia 50 was a great place to stay. It was a girls weekend away for us and we felt very comfortable in this part of town. We stayed on the 16th floor in a one bedroom suite. I have stayed in quite a few hotels and I have to say that this suite was VERY LARGE. The kitchen with full size fridge was a plus for all of our snacks and drinks. The doormen were so sweet and were GREAT at getting cabs very quickly for us.I do suggest the New York Lunchonette two doors down as well as Wollensky's Grill a block away. It was an amazing steak house with fabulous service and a fun atmosphere.Back to the hotel...we have absolutly no complaints! Just a forwarning, some of the stores security devices will deactivate your room key cards so be prepared to make a few trips back down to the lobby bc you can't get in your room. It wasn't really a hassle and they always gave us new cards very quickly! Also, there is a little grocery shop with toiletries, drinks, snacks, etc. just a few doors down. It was nice to have something so close to grab things that we might have forgotten. I needed advil to soothe my aching arms from carrying way too many shopping bags! This was a great hotel with easy subway access, great rooms and a great staff!

<Content>Absolutely Awesome Affinia 50 We just returned from a four day stay at the Affinia 50. It was our first trip to NYC (myself and two girls that I work with) and didn't know what to expect. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like princesses - and we felt extremely safe.Our room was huge - two queen beds, fold out sofa, small kitchen with full size fridge, microwave and stove. The bedding is to die for and we hated to get up in the morning. We saw two broadway shows and took a taxi for those, but otherwise, used the subway which is right around the corner from the hotel.I still can't believe our trip is over already and am planning on returning with my family at Christmas time.Loved everything about our visit and will definately stay at the Affinia 50 again!!

<Content>Location, Size and Family Friendly Our first family stay in New York City, with the Affinia 50 as our host went off without a hitch. I started communicating with Tanya the concierge a month in advance and she helped with show tickets, restaurant reservations, tips for activities for kids and quickly answered all of my questions - she was fantastic. The room was enormous by New York standards, I have traveled to New York without my family and had great fear of fitting all four of us in a New York hotel room. This is the spot. Doormen were incredible, it was raining some of the time we were there, and the doorman went 1/2 block out the front door to hail a cab for us - we saw him out there doing the same thing for others staying at the hotel - greated us with a Welcome Back every time we passed through the door. Service was flawless by all staff. This hotel is in a safe, neighborhood - very close to subways which we used with ease. My girls are 7 and 11, they loved the subway - we could easily get everywhere we needed to go! We used the New York related media in the club room, and the girls loved using the single serve gourmet coffee machine (making coffee for Mom)Thanks Affinia, we'll be back!

<Content>Not as good as expected We have just returned from a weeks stay at the Affinia 50. We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reports and have to say that we were a bit disappointed. We found the rooms were not as clean as we expected them to be and it looked as though our room hadn鈥檛 even been vacuumed prior to our arrival. However, towels and bed linen were changed every day and the bed was very comfortable.Most of the staff were pleasant however the doormen were rarely to be seen, and when we did see them on the odd occasion they were not overly pleasant.Location of the hotel is very good and the one bedroom suite we stayed in was huge, however the bathroom was a bit on the small side. We feel that the hotel was ok overall, however it does not really deserve to be in the top ten hotels in New York.

<Content>Book the Affinia 50 Now! Just returned from nine nights at the Affinia 50 in New York City. My wife and two daughters (11 and 8) had a junior suite. We had selected the Affinia 50 based on the TripAdvisor ratings/reviews. If you are considering this hotel for your stay, book it now and do not look back. It was a wonderful experience. There were a few minor glitches (e.g. swipe card malfunction, one long elevator wait), but overall, we have no complaints. It was great having a refrigerator. And conveniently located - we walked or took the subway everywhere (the north/south 6 train stop is one block over on Lexington). Quite the enjoyable experience!

<Content>The Scots in New York My husband , two boys and my sons girlfriend have just come back from New York on the 13th June, we stayed at the Affinia 50 for five nights. I must admit at first I found the room quite dingy and dark , but we had travelled a long way, it was raining very heavily and felt how had we come here on holiday. It was our first holiday in 10 years. We were very cold in the room the first night and was unable to get the heating working with the controls , told by the front desk that it was not working but they would send up a heater, worked fine and was warmer in no time, remember really tired so feeling a bit cheesed off. Had the best nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel, the mattress topper on the bed and of course my choice of pillow all added to the great comfort. I am not very good at staying in strange beds usually do not sleep well at all, but this bed was great. The second day a bit brighter all round, mood better, had a great nights sleep, so opinion changed, felt the room was fine, big and plenty of space for all our stuff. I must say the staff especially the doormen were absolutely delightful, very very helpful and so so pleasant all the time. Our room was kept reasonably clean, felt it could have been a bit better but fine. The location of the hotel is brilliant just short walk to 5th Avenue, Central Station, Saks, The NBA shop, Central Park, and Rockaffella Centre. Found our way about in no time, the shopping is fantastic, absolutely no money left now, but who cares!!! all well worth it. The only disappointment is that the hotel has no bar and a nightcap before bed and a chance to mingle with other hotel guests would have been good, but hey, has done our livers the world of good. Would recommend this hotel to anyone and a great big thank you to the wonderful doormen and hope you all have a great holiday like we did, WELL BE BACK , AS ARNI SAYS!!!!

<Content>Bad Street Noise The Affinia 50 was very disappointing after reading the stellar reviews found on this site over the last year. When I arrived, the staff could not find my reservation but after an hour finally were able to pull it up. The junior suite that I booked had the smallest bathroom and sink known in NYC hotels. I asked for a quiet room well in advance only to get one facing 3rd Avenue on the 8th floor as all I heard for 2 nights was street noise and car horns. The staff was not helpful at all during the check in process nor was I able to change rooms. Given the noise and the bathrooms, this hotel is not among the top 10 in New YorK City.

<Content>Would Stay Here again in a NY Minute! My mother and I just returned from a 4 day trip to NYC! I found Affinia 50 through TripAdvisor, whom I use for all my hotel references. TripAdvisor and it's users did not steer us wrong - Affinia 50 was perfect! Upon arrival around 2:15pm we were told that our room was not ready, the bellman stored our bags while we had a Thai lunch meal. Upon returning we were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite (we reserved a Jr. Suite). The suite was HUGE! I do believe that most Manhattanite's would kill for an apt this size! There were two queen beds, a sitting area, a bathroom (with nice tub and shower) and a kitchen. You could spend all day in the room and not feel cramped. We skipped the breakfast, but tried NY Deli (not impressive). Based on a review on this site, we tried Azure Deli (around the corner on 3rd, in the same building). We were blown away by this deli. The buffet was out of this world. Every food choice was available. The proprietor was soo cute.. I asked him if he was open 24 hours.. he said 25 hours.. one hour extra for you! :)Tonya the concierge, Gloria at the front desk and the doormen (Selwyn, etc) were great. They were extremely helpful with directions and general what to do questions. We did not experience any problems with A/C, heat, hot water.. nothing.. There was a pillow menu on our pillow, but we were happy with the ones we had. I did not see any robes, but in the grand scheme of things.. it didn't matter.MINT, the Indian restaurant across the street was Fabulous! I would definitely stay at Affinia 50 again... in a NY minute!!!

<Content>Very good, but not 100% Having stayed in NYC several times and having read the online reviews, we were really looking forward to our stay at the Affinia. We had booked one twin and one single room. On arrival we were allocated rooms on the third floor - the twin room (316) being particularly dark with no view (overlooked a balcony which you could not access from the room). This was a shame as I had emailed twice prior to arrival to ask for a high floor room if possible as this was my parent's first trip to NYC and an anniversary gift, so really wanted it to be special. A standard lamp was placed in the room the following day - without us having requested this - we were told that some guests had complained the rooms were dark. The rooms were good, although I had a problem with my safe - this took 36 hrs to resolve - not a huge problem as I used the other room's safe, but would have been a problem if we only had one room. Also the coffee machine was faulty and 316 had probs with their plumbing. I cannot fault housekeeping - they were fantastic - rooms were spotless and towels / toiletries replaced each day. Whilst the staff were friendly, the doormen were rarely at the door on your arrival and we found that the desk staff did not volunteer a greeting unless we did so first. However, in fairness, when they did speak, all staff were extremely friendly, polite and only too willing to assist. My impression prior to travelling was that this hotel, being smaller than alot of the hotels in NYC, prided itself on being that much more personal. Unfortunately, I did not feel this to be the case. I wouldn't be put off staying there again, but I think I would make a point of being more pushy about room location and complain more when things go wrong.

<Content>Amazing ! We could not get over the size of our 1 bedroom suite. So very nice, comfortable, and CLEAN. My sister and I stayed for 6 nights and we could never have found a better location or neighborhood. We were able to walk to so many places or take a cab and then stroll back. The doormen always greeted us before we got to the door with welcome home and cheers. This hotel was part of our whole amazing time in NYC. 2nd floor club level was so nice to relax in for afternoon coffee or wine  cheese each eveing. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and I do hope to stay here again.ps New York Lunchonette' next door is very good. The California Club sandwich was my favorite.

<Content>HUGE rooms! I live in NYC, but needed to stay in a hotel for 1 night. I booked a regular room at the Affinia 50 and the nice guy at the front desk upgraded me to a one room suite. IT WAS HUGE! I wish my NYC apartment was as big. My friend and I tried the wine and cheese hour on the 2nd floor and it was really fun. There were several people (but not overly crowded) and it was a really festive atmosphere. It was a great place to watch tv, work on the laptop, etc.Everyone that works at the hotel is beyond nice. From the doormen, to the front desk to the ladies at the Happy Hour...everyone was lovely! There were great Aveda products in the bath and the linens/bed are terrific. I was in room 1806. It runs the length of the side of the building and had terrace for the entire length with entrances from both the living room and bedroom. It was perfect because it doesn't face the brick wall to the back and doesn't directly face the street for any traffic. The ONLY downside to my stay doesn't directly relate to the hotel. They do offer roomservice, but it is from the restaurant next door. We decided to take advantage of our dining room and order in. The food arrived after about an hour and half. We had 1 napkin for the 2 of us. There was no salt, no pepper, no catsup, no mustard, etc. We called to have it sent up and when he finally returned about 20 mintues later he still didn't bring salt. We were told they were out. Now, the room does have a kitchen, but it isn't stocked with things like salt and pepper. I am always prepared to pay more for roomservice, however, we paid $200 for 2 people. That included a $26 tip and to be told they were out of salt is just unacceptable. But please only take this as a warning for roomservice and don't let it stop you from staying at the hotel. I didn't see their breakfast that they offer, but if it is like the Happy Hour...I'm sure it was nice.My overall experience was fantastic. I will stay at the Affinia 50 again. I will just avoid ordering in. There are plenty of great restaurants in the neighborhood and I will just enjoy one of those places instead.

<Content>great for long stay I stayed at this hotel for several weeks while searching for an appartment in New York when I moved here for work last September. I had an excellent stay. The staff are polite and very helpful. The rooms are huge for NY standards which is important when staying more than a few days. I loved having my kitchen, esp as the hotel does not do breakfast, I could just make my own. Also a microwave if I didn't feel like eating out every night. Great beds, good desk, clean and quiet. Laundry facilities in the basement. I recommend it to all my colleagues travelling here.

<Content>Nice Hotel! I was sent to this hotel after surgery (surgeon gets a commission for sending patients) and was surprised it was a nice place. Staff was very friendly and accomadating. Room was very big for NYC standards. It had a small kitchen, nice furniture/decor, very clean.

<Content>Highly Reccomend the Affinia 50 We stayed at the Affinia 50 for one night in March 2006. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The concierge was very knowledgeable and went out of her way to find out our preferences before making suggestions for dinner.The location is great a few blocks from Rockefeller Center, and on a relatively quiet street.Our only complaint was that the bathroom was a little small. Otherwise we had plenty of room, in room internet access, and even a kitchen in the room.After we got home we received a survey and after completing it were given a discount certificate for our next stay.We will definitely stay there on future trips to New York..

<Content>Wayyy exceeded expectations I have to go to NYC about every 3-4 weeks on business. I've often stayed at the Benjamin which is a sister property to the Affinia 50. On this trip, the Benjamin was pricing at $498/night so our corporate travel dept asked me to try out the Affinia 50. A few of my colleagues had stayed there about a year ago and hated it so I was pretty nervous. When I arrived, the staff could not have been more gracious or polite. They recognized me as a past guest of the Benjamin and went out of their way to welcome me to their hotel. It was clear that it had been pretty newly renovated and their pride in their hotel showed. The lobby is small, but lovely. There is a very cool waterfall feature that starts up on the 2nd floor (where there is a gorgeous lounge) and flows to the lobby. My room was very nicely decorated, with excellent work space and a bed that was heavenly (sorry Westin, this bed was better!). They have a pillow menu which is awesome if you are a picky pillow person. The room is a typical NYC size - not huge, but not tiny either. The bathroom was nicely appointed, with Aveda amenities and plenty of hot water. When I was given the room assignment, I was concerned bc I was on the 3rd floor, but I never heard a bit of street noise - until I opened the window. My only ding on the hotel was that the HVAC system was not working correctly, and by night time, my room was hot and the AC had not yet been turned on - that's when I discovered the windows could open! I am a very picky, very frequent traveler, and I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Wonderful hotel! The Affinia 50 was perfect for our bachelorette party! We booked a room with two queen beds and a fold out couch. The room was nicely decorated, clean, and surprisingly large, and the beds had down comforters, which is always nice. The hotel is located in Midtown Manhattan, close to Times Square and Park Avenue and a few blocks from a subway station. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful - even after bringing up countless extra towels for us! I would definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>Great time April 3 - 9th, 2006 in NYC  Our husbands weren't interested in spring break travel, so a coworker friend and I recently planned our very first trip ever to NYC. We chose the Affinia 50 based almost solely on the Trip Advisor reviews -- and we weren't the least bit disappointed.Our room was #1603, a jr. suite with a small balcony, corner suite so we had windows on two sides. My coworker brought along her 11 YO son and the 3 of us had plenty of room in our suite -- two queen beds, one for each adults and a pull-out sofa queen bed for my coworker's son.The kitchenette is very handy-- we liked being able to keep cold drinks and bottled water on hand (available at the corner deli). There is a toaster, microwave, and small range as well -- The wine  cheese on the 2nd floor Mon-Thurs was a treat -- 6-7 PM only -- we first arrived on Tuesday about 6:45 PM and upon check-in asked if we could grab a glass of wine to take to our room -- the front desk clerk said Of Course! but when we stopped off on the 2nd floor, the attendant there would not allow us to do so... Not sure why we were refused... he seemed a little flustered that we even asked so we just headed on upstairs wine-less.The door attendants are attentive and friendly, as are the front desk and housekeeping staff.Tonya the concierge cheerfully and expertly obtained a last minute ticket for the Saturday matinee of Wicked -- a little pricey at $200 (though much less than the box-office premium price of $340+ for a last-minute single seat) -- and since I likely won't be traveling back to NYC any time soon, for me, it was worth every dime -- fabulous fabulous fabulous production.We also asked Tonya for a recommendation for a good close-by Italian restaurant -- she recommended Ribot's just a block or two away -- not impressed -- overly priced, and not a 'traditional' Italian menu -- I ordered the lasagna thinking it would be... well... lasagna. It had lasagna noodles, but was filled with cream sauce (which I don't much care for) and string beans and potato chunks. No protein (like chicken or whatever) and no marinara sauce (which is what I expected) anywhere in sight. My friend ordered the lobster salad for $21.00 -- and within a short time spent the rest of the night in the bathroom and all day the next day in bed from apparent food poisoning. (I'm writing this review from the hotel -- she's still hunkered down in bed and I'm hoping we can get her well enough to put her on the plane home in the morning.Trying to think of anything really negative about the Affinia50 has been tough -- We had plenty of hot water for the 3 of us -- the temperature in the room is a little tough to control for individual tastes -- and you may find yourself waiting on an elevator during busy times as we did -- but usually not for long. Street noise -- yes, some -- but hey -- it's NEW YORK CITY! We managed to sleep right through it...Overall -- the Affinia 50 more than met our expectations. Neither of us however had any other experience in NYC to compare it to -- it is nicely located as others have pointed out. We used the subway from time to time, but our feet to walk just about everywhere...Our first 3 days were incredible -- we do recommend skipping the trip to the top of the Empire State Building - what a racket -- it was very overcast the day we went, which was fine -- but we paid $16.00 to go to the top... they practically force-fed another Omni-type movie presentation for an additional fee, which we turned down and they seemed a little annoyed that we didn't want to do it. Judging by the empty rows of disneyland-type roping for people to traverse through, we were there on a very slow day -- it still took us nearly an hour to get to the single elevator -- where they shuttle us sardine-cram-packed to floor 82 where they make you get off and you are MANDATED to have your picture taken for purchase later -- then you get back in line to get back on the elevator to go to the top -- there you are shoved out into the gift shop -- and though on a nice day, it would have been pleasant once you got up there and outside, it was windy and cold and we barely stayed outside for 2 or 3 minutes... then went back down where we were AGAIN forced to go the 82nd floor route to LOOK at the photos we were forced to pose for and tell them we didn't want them, only to get back in line AGAIN to get the final ride to the bottom. Skip this nonsense and go to the Rockefeller Top of the Rock instead -- if you go there in the evening hours, it is much less crowded and we had a great experience with a clear night and a beautiful view.Liberty/Ellis Island were terrific. We also saw Al Roker up close at the Today show set, and also went skating at Rockefeller plaza. We had fun walking all over Times Square and Battery Park -- South Seaport's exhibit The Body is quite interesting if you like that sort of stuff (we did)...Everything in NYC is is pretty spendy so bring lots of $$$...Final word on the Affinia 50 -- compared to other hotels we've been in throughout various locations in the U.S., we all 3 voted that we would recommend the Affinia 50 to other travelers without hesitation. Have fun in the Big Apple! (Except for the food-poisoning incident) we sure did!

<Content>Great Value for NYC! Great hotel! For the first time a hotel exceeded our expectations in NYC. The room was well...roomy, clean and modern. My wife really enjoyed the free Aveda samples. There was however a little street noise but hey, it's New York, you expect to hear a car honk now and then. The hotel itself is centrally located and walking distance to Broadway, Central Park and 5th avenue. Finally, the service was extraordinary for NYC. If the price stays reasonable, we'll be back!

<Content>Best Deal in NYC My wife, two teenage daughters, and I stayed here for four days last summer. The room was huge by NYC standards! Two large very comfortable beds, a large living room area(sofa and upolstered chair, desk area, and a kitchen. Very clean and comfortable. The staff was wonderful and entertaining. Easy access to subway, and walking distance to Times Square, Empire State Building, Central Park, Etc.I had read about issues with hot water system and we did experience a little bit of that. But all-in-all this place is excellent! And you can't beat the price (remember this IS New York City).

<Content>Loved the Affinia 50 The bed had to be the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The pillow selection was a nice touch. The pictures on the website are exactly what our room looked like. It was a great location. The doorman, Rome made us feel very welcome. Our room was clean and comfortable. The price is right for this hotel. I would stay again on my next visit to NY.

<Content>O.K. By NYC Standards............h Stayed here for 4 nights, reserved a Jr. Suite. Room requests were not honored. The hotel was o.k., not as good as expected.1)Checked in late morning. My room was not ready, come back at 2:00 (I had requested a room away from the elevator, or with a view). When I returned, and again noted my preferences, the only rooms available in the Jr. Suite category that met my requests were without two queen beds (I was told most of the Jr. Suites are in the back, along the alley). We were eventually placed in a lower room floor (6), no view (on the back alley, albeit quiet), next to the elevator (ding, ding).2) And, speaking of the elevator, only one (of 2 to the floors above 5) was broken on Saturday, fixed on Sunday. We could at least walk the six flights to our room.3) The rooms. They are large, and nicely decorated. The beds were comfortable, the housekeeping staff helpful (the gas stove didn't appear to be working properly, maintenance arrived with 10 minutes). The kitchen is a great advantage if you don't want to drop $$$ eating 3 meals in restaurants.4) The doormen were friendly, helpful, and as cheerful as you will find within the hotel staff.4) The lounge was very nice. With the exception of the pleasant wine reception, M-Th for one hour, and the a.m. breakfast, it was deserted. 5) Location was good, walking distance to Grand Central, Rock Center, Times Square (a bit of a hike) and the subway.6) Prior to departing to the airport, I requested assistance in getting my airline boarding pass printed out. Was told by desk staff that I needed to use their business center (at $8 per 15 minutes) to do this. The concierge was not on duty until noon. At last, I asked one of the managers passing through the lobby, who agreed to help. Success!Overall, maintenance, housekeeping, room quality good. Doormen, great. Front office/desk staff, need work.

<Content>A wonderful hotel This hotel could not have been better. The staff were so friendly and helpful, the rooms were huge!! and the beds were divine. I really could not fault it. I stayed there with my father and daughter and would go back tomorrow if I could! There was even a CD player in each room with a jazz/blues CD to remind you that you were in the Big Apple. Plenty of great pubs in the area - try JD's round the corner for superb food and a really friendly atmosphere. Avoid Mama Mexican - they really rip you off with the service charge and the atmosphere is quite intimidating if you don't order lots of drinks!

<Content>Wonderful hotel, Superb location, Great staff Having just returned from our first trip to New York, we felt we had to praise the Affinia 50 hotel. The hotel's location was first-class, with a good selection of restaurants close-by (try the Mexican on 2nd Ave - Zarella'a; and the diner a few doors up for a great breakfast). The room we were given was spacious, clean and well-appointed. The bed was sooooo comfortable! The staff in the hotel couldn't do enough for you - but weren't 'over the top', just friendly and helpful.The subway was only a block away, and is an efficient system that gets you all around New York. For a great place for drinks, try the quirky Monkey bar at the Hotel Elysee (about 10 mins from the Affinia 50) or for a treat, the bar on the 23rd floor of The Peninsula Hotel - great views of the city! Thanks to the Affinia 50 for making our first trip to New York so enjoyable!!

<Content>Its not 5 star but does that matter.....? Small Public areas but massive rooms I know which i prefer. We had a 1 bedroom suite on the 15th floor. The rooms was super huge.The kitchen was somewhat dated and the bathroom lacked heating. Even on the 15th floor there was quite a bit of street noise. We cornered on 3rd and 50th. The bed was again huge - and great to sleep in. The hotels location is great and the Azurre deli aroudn the corner on 3rd is incredible. We had a great stay and after covering alot of ground by foot over our 5 day stay was were really glad to have somewhere to comeback to relax. The Affina 50 delivered....

<Content>Affinia 50 - Great Location, Great Staff The location was excellent in Midtown East. It is only a few blocks walk to the UN, Times Square, Grand Central, and the NY Public Library. My room faced the street and was therefore a little noisier, but I enjoyed it. The kitchenette was small, but good for my purposes (coffee in the AM and putting leftovers in the fridge). The breakfast was convenient, but overpriced. Lots of great restaurants nearby - a fantastic Turkish place and a really funky Indian restaurant. Good shopping nearby, as well. Perks:Pillow service - choose from a selection of pillow types and styles. Aveda products in the bathroom! Two Internet stations available until 11:00 PM.Gym - I didn't use it.Excellent, safe location.Spotted some celebrities in the neighbourhood. The staff were very nice. I had a stain on my shirt and asked the staff to leave me some cleaning liquid, which they did. They were very polite and friendly.Definitely would recommend it and would stay there again.

<Content>Wonderfully accomodating Six friends and I booked two rooms on-line (a one bedroom suite and a jr. suite)for one Saturday night. (We were in town to see a play) We requested adjoining/connecting rooms. When we arrived at the hotel we discovered that the rooms were on different floors. The manager, who was very friendly and accomodating arranged for 2 one bedroom suites that were right next to one another in a corner on the 20th floor. It felt like we had the entire floor to ourselves. Wow! The rooms were great. They were very spacious and comfortable. Even the roll-away bed was comfy. The kitchen was very adequate for its purpose. We had a lot of snacks and drinks. There was plenty of room for all of our food. And they had clean glasses, plates and cups in cupboards. The concierge recommended two marvelous spots for Sunday brunch. She called to make reservations for us and when we arrived at the restaurant the following afternoon we had an excellent table. We checked out of the hotel Sunday afternoon and were able to leave our 16 or so pieces of luggage in the hotel while we attended the theatre. We picked up our bags, drove to Long Island and realized that two bags were missing and we had left a cell phone charger in the room. The bellman brought the bags and cell phone charger to us in Long Island!!! The service at this hotel is exceptional - enough said. Cheers.

<Content>Great location, OK hotel The location of this hotel is great. The hotel room was average. I guess you get what you pay for in this case! The room rate was very reasonable. Our room was located in front of the elevator and our window faced the street, VERY NOISY! After the first night, I requested a room change but was told that the hotel was sold out and a room change was not an option. When making a reservation, you may want to request a room away from the elevator.The temperature of the room was also a problem. During the winter months, the AC does not work. The room was very stuffy. We had to get someone from the front desk to open the window in our room to get air circulating. The room is small so I guess that is why it was so stuffy. By the way, the bathroom is big enough for one person at a time. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Don't expect luxury at all, but for the price you pay I guess it is average. It was also nice that they supply Aveda products in the bathroom.When we were checking out, I voiced my opinion to the front desk clerk. She did give me a voucher for a room upgrade if we decide to stay there again in the future.

<Content>Thanks TANYA! All in all yeah the affinia 50's above average. Classy joint, good location, clean rooms, very comfortable beds, however I think the overwhelming popularity on this place on TripAdvisor's turned this place into somewhat of a zoo... got kind of noisy @ night, the staff in the lobby could be more proactive and helpful - I had to pull teeth to find a local computer repair place, I suggest a free public computer in the lobby would be most helpful!BUT MOST HELPFUL EMPLOYEE AWARD GOES TO: (and she knows who she is...) Tanya @ concierge! Tanya let me print out a couple pages instead of being way inconvenienced by ~$7?/hr to use the business center. Tanya also recommended and made last minute dinner reservations @ an incredible Italian restaurant down the street.Thanks to Tanya we may be back!Thanks again.

<Content>Wear Comfortable Shoes Had a great stay at this hotel - great service, comfortable bed, good location for all of our sightseeing needs. Wherever you stay in New York make sure you bring some comfortable shoes for walking. My feet were killing me after a day pounding the pavements. The concierge at this hotel was so kind to give me advice about finding comfortable shoes - he ponted me to a great website where I have since found comfortable walking shoes:[--]

<Content>What a find Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Affina 50. Location excellent. Service outstanding. Clean , comfortable, just brilliant.Subway one block up from the hotel. Great places to eat nearby.Eat at the New York dinner a couple of doors up from the affina. Breakfast is a must we paid no more than $25 for a family of 4.If in the city on a sight seeing trip I'd suggest the Gray line hopper bus tour. Well worth the money.We were in the city with our 2 children aged 10 and 14 who fell in love with New York. Well done affina on making our visit a happy relaxed chilled out one. We will be back .The Bentley Family.BARNSLEY

<Content>Good Value. We recently spent three days at the Affinia 50, after finding a rate of $177 for a standard room, through the internet.We travel to NYC a couple times per year, and lived in the city many years ago.We found the Affinia 50 to be a reasonably good value for the money. The hotel is pleasant, clean, with good natured staff, and a terrific location in East Midtown. It is an easy and safe walk to Times Square, to Rockefeller Center, the 5th Ave. corridor, the Theater District, and the Modern Arts Museum. There are several ATMs within a block from the hotel, as well as a farmacy, and one of those wonderful delis with a huge salad and hot food bars. Breakfast at the hotel is overpriced, but OK if you want to save time or avoid walking. There is a Starbucks and a Au Bon Pain within a two block radius.The rooms are spacious, seem to have been recently renovated, with comfortable beds and pillows, and nicely appointed bathrooms with Aveda toiletries.Although we were in a standard room, there was a small kitchen counter, sink, refrigerator and microwave oven. Complimentary coffee is supplied.We asked for a room facing the back, which was very quiet, despite being next to the elevators, on the 19th floor. Housekeeping and maintenance (the toilet was clogged when we arrived) is courteous and efficient.We were quoted a parking rate of $34 over the phone, but on arrival were told our vehicle was too large (A Honda CR-V!), and would have to pay $44 per day. I found parking around the corner on 51st St. for $39.Our only complaints were the (old) slow elevators, one of which seemed to be frequently out of order, and room thermostats which don't seem to work (the windows can be opened).In all, The Affinia 50 is a logically priced three star hotel, that we will surely return to, in future trips.

<Content>Nice room for the price The Affinia 50 was a fine hotel and very comfortable, especially for the price. Just got back from a two night weekend getaway with my husband. We had a junior suite, which was a v large room with a kitchenette. Bathroom was a little small. The location is good if you're looking for something midtown - close to the subway line and walking distance to midtown sights. Staff was excellent. That said, sometimes I just prefer a hotel with a little more character - even if it costs a little more. The affinia 50 was functional but not charming. I might stay here again if the price is as good as the deal we got this weekend.

<Content>Top Hotel great location Stayed in the hotel for 7 nights in Feb/March 2006. Would stay again!Top hotel. No Bar or restaurant on premises however great location, great service and great modern rooms.Look out for complimentary cheese and wine (mon/thurs 6-7) in the very nice lounge area on floor 2. TIP: Ask for a high floor room otherwise it will be too noisy (floor 8 and above).Don鈥檛 bother with the Super Shuttle from Expedia, nothing super about it!

<Content>It's the best! Affinia 50 is top notch in every way. If you are going into the City, you have to give it a try. As a former New Yorker, I like to get to lots of different areas of Manhatten when I come in for a weekend, now that I live in New England. You will really like the new look and feel. It's the best! Very comfortable beds and great decor. We had a great view of the streets and everyone who works there is unbelievably attentive. NY is is a great City and Affinia is a excellent example of its hospitality.We've stayed there many times and it's always been a hotel you can count on to make your stay terrific, from check in to check out.

<Content>Best Secret in New York This hotel gets the A+ award for cleanliness, interesting art/decor, great use of space and friendly and sincerely caring staff. I have been staying at this hotel since I moved to Boston from NY several years ago. Whether for a quick business trip or a fun getaway weekend in the City, my first choice is always Affinia 50. You can't beat the location for going uptown, downtown or crosstown for theatre. When they've been sold out, I have tried others like the Hilton and a few boutique hotels. None measure up.It's hard to find this type of service, wonderful space and great attention to security in a NY hotel. There always seem to be trade offs but not here! I highly recommend you give it a try on your next trip into the City.

<Content>Just stay here, it really is that good! This hotel stay is one of the most pleasant we have experienced. It was a treat for my parents 60th Birthdays and 40th Wedding Aniversary. Our maid was fantastic, the doormen exemplary and the desk staff the most pleasant, professional and courteous I've ever had the pleasure to meet. Things work really well at the Affinia. It truly seems set up to cater for the guest, so many hotels forget their raison d'etre. They did a fantastic job for us and my parents were blown away by all the staff. The 2nd floor club room is a fantastic environment to chill in before or after being having your senses assualted by NY. We'll only be coming to one hotel when we return to NYC. Everything else you read in the reviews is correct, we read them all before choosing this hotel. There are loads of delis and chemists (drug stores) in the immediate vicinity

<Content>Great for families We went (family of four) during the Thanksgiving holiday. I was a little skeptical staying in a hotel I did not recognize (ie Hyatt, Marriott, etc), but I was looking for something bigger than the standard hotel room. It was fabulous! First off though because I asked for an upper floor with a balcony we received a rather smallish room with a HUGE balcony. Great for summer, not great for November. So the next day they accomodated us and gave us a non-balcony room. It was the largest hotel room I've ever stayed in - easily 600 sq. feet. The living area/dining area (with sofa bed)was large, the bedroom (with two double beds) was a standard hotel room size. The bathroom modern but small. The kitchen had everything in a small space, but enough room to cook.I would recommend this place especially for families. Plenty of room to spread out for the cost of a typical hotel room in New York. O'neils a few doors down has great food too.

<Content>Top Notch Hotel There's not much more I can add that hasn't already been said in other reviews - the location was 1 block from the 6 train, the employees were terrific and the room was great. It was clean, pretty big, and had the most comfortable bed, comforter, pillows that I have ever had. The bathroom had all Aveda products (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap).I got a really good deal ($159 a night) and I would definitely stay here again for those prices. It was by far the nicest hotel we've stayed in NYC.

<Content>Wonderfully comfortable hotel My husband and I booked a single queen-bed room (for $169) at the Affinia 50 for one night based on the TripAdvisor reviews. We were able to check in early (just after noon) and received a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite. (We don't know why because the hotel was sold out for the night.) Everything was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We were on the sixth floor and had a great view of the Blizzard of 2006! We only stayed one night but would have been very comfortable staying longer. The hotel is just a couple of blocks east of St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rockefellar Center. We passed up the cold breakfast buffet ($15) on the second floor in favor of O'Neil's hot breakfast buffet ($12) two doors down. I highly recommend O'Neil's - the buffet was great - they made omelets to order and there was plenty of fresh fruit and baked goods. The buffet included coffee and orange juice. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. They also let us have a one hour late check out. The only down side was that we attended three shows while we were in NYC and we were on the east side of 5th avenue rather than the west side (where the theaters are) - although its much quieter on the east side.

<Content>The best I checked in around 3:30-4:00 pm on Saturday. To begin, I drove into the city fearing that I would have no where to park my car, but as soon as I arrived the young man in front of the hotel helped me with my bags and assured me that my car would be parked in a safe place. Needless to say this was a weight off my shoulders. Next, the young woman at the reception desk was absolutely the most professional and courteous person I have seen in a while. She was great. Furthermore, the hotel looked amazing and the rooms were spacious and extremely comfortable. The next day we woke to find the city covered in snow. Within a few minutes of requesting my car it was in front of the hotel waiting. My girlfriend and I are both in college and graduating this May and on my budget, this was a great value for excellent service from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left. I have already recommended this hotel to a few of my friends who are looking to do something nice for their girlfriends and will continue to recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in a hotel in the city. Job well done!

<Content>Great Place to Stay This hotel has it all!! From the time we arrived until the time we left, it was a wonderful experience. The staff is very friendly and quick to meet any of your needs. The rooms are outstanding as far as the size goes. We had a junior suite for three of us, which included a full kitchen area, a couch and chairs for relaxing. The beds were so luxurious, with a special pillow menu, which we indulged in. The location was great, easy walking distance to most attractions. We felt very safe in this area at night(3 women). It is also right by the subway line, which is very convenient(direct line to Canal Street) if cabs are not readily available. The only downfall is getting a cab if it's raining, because the two hotels down the street get the cabs first (one way street). We had to walk across to the Waldorf for a cab which still took some time. We would definitely stay here again. It's a lot quieter than Times Square.

<Content>Excellent Service, Great Location We visited the Plaza 50 (as it was known then) in April 2004, and were pleasantly surprised. The twin rooms had lovely king size double beds, a compact but nice size bathroom, and everything seemed clean and well kept. Service was excellent, you just cannot fault the staff at this hotel from the doorman with his little jaunty hat, to the reception staff. I would be careful about which room you get though - I had a twin room to myself, but my window faced a huge wall which was just beneath the main buildings fan... so it could seem quite noisy at night! But thats no real criticism, as for us we just wanted to sleep and wash up at the hotel so we could explore NY city, not live there! My tip - don't bother with room service for food. There is an excellent diner next door for breakfasts, lunches, and even 1am snacks! The hotel get all of their food from there, and pass on the surcharge to you, so why not just get up out of your bed and save yourself a few 'bucks' by simply going to the diner and eating there? Otherwise, this is a brilliant place. When we stayed, it ranked about 70th on the tripadvisor list - and now its number 2! I'm not surprised. Everything is within walking distance, its a nice part of town away from the tourist crowds, and I would happily stay there again in the future.

<Content>a Tripadvisor rec. pays off again! We stayed 2 nights at the Affinia 50, having booked it because it was the cheapest well-reviewed hotel on Tripadvisor (we paid about $160 a night for a regular guest room in late January). The bed was one of the most comfortable I've encountered--in a hotel or anywhere--with really wonderful bedclothes. The room was quite large by NYC standards, with plenty of room to work away from the bed. Great bathroom, too.As mentioned, there's no restaurant, and we didn't go to the (rather expensive) buffet breakfast, but there's a great bagel store just around the corner on 3rd Ave. The nicest surprise at the Affinia was the staff, who were friendly  helpful without exception, no matter the hour.

<Content>Huge, Clean, Modern Rooms at the Affinia 50 Went to The City for Christmas. This hotel was probably the nicest surprise of our trip! I picked it largely based on these reviews. Our room was HUGE w/ a full kitchenette, big very comfortable king-sized bed, choice of pillow types, couch, large work desk, lots of storage and closet space, full-view mirror, Aveeda bath products, 5 large windows overlooking 51st street office, polite staff. Everyone kept warning me how rooms described as large in NYC are usually average-sized at best compared to other locations-- not this place!! They were also very clean and very modern. Outside noise could be heard but was minimal. Location is great!, 2 blocks from 5th Avenue, minutes from Rockefeller Center. We got a great rate, less than $200 a night. Don't let the small (yet clean, not cramped, modern) lobby fool you (you can walk through several $400+-a-night more grand hotel lobbies nearby for free!). The whole second floor is a guest lounge (not a bar kind), much like the airline club ones. No restaurant didn't bother us, plenty of dining and a full grocery right around the corner w/o crossing a street. Can you tell that we will go back?

<Content>A great hotel Stayed here for two weeks over the Christmas/New Year period. This place is a rarity in new York hotels. It has large rooms (huge is probably a better description) and the friendliest most helpful staff.Internet access is a bit expensive and there are not many other options in the area. That aside I will definitely be coming back here as my first choice for New York accommodation.

<Content>Good hotel, good price, good location. After much research, we stayed at the Affinia from Tues. to Thurs. The price was decent for what we got. The rooms were big enough, probably large for NYC standards! My only suggestion would be to request a room on an upper floor. We stayed on the 5th floor and each time we opened the window we got the fumes from the McDonald's on 3rd ave! I love their fries, but don't want to smell them in my sleep!! The hotel is on the same block as the much pricier and fancier Benjamin and Kimberly. I'd definately stay again!

<Content>Loved this hotel We had an excellent stay at the Affinia 50. We had a one-bedroom suite for 2 moms and 4 kids; it was more than adequate! It consisted of 2 queen beds and a pullout sofa. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were huge. The kids even commented on how nice this hotel was. The staff was always helpful and friendly. It is conveniently located close to Rockafeller Center/5th avenue. We plan on returning to the Affinia 50 on our next trip!

<Content>Awesome Affinia! We just returned from a quick trip to NYC and chose the Affinia based upon tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. The staff knocks themselves out to be helpful. Tanya, the concierge made great recommendations and reservations for brunch and dinner. She even sent us complimentary champagne at dinner for our special occasion. The bellhops were very friendly and the valet parking worked out well. Our room was a great deal thanks to their Sunday in the City package. The one bedroom suite was very spacious and nice. If you wanted to cook in for a longer stay they provide stove, fridge and dishwasher. Perfect for families. The bed was quite comfortable. I was a little disappointed in the pillow menu. Only 3 to choose from and we each chose one. None of them were as nice as what was on the bed. The hotel is in a great location and it is very quiet. Ess a bagel is great for NY bagels. We'll definitely return. Enjoy!

<Content>Good, not excellent My two teenagers and I stayed at the Affinia 50 from Jan. 14 - 16. While I agree with the reviewers who loved the spacious junior suites, our refrigerator/freezer did not work, and no one was sent to repair it during our stay (I did mention it twice at the front desk, but wasn't too worried because we hadn't really planned to rely on it, although the absence of ice was annoying).Also, for us, being on teen time, not serving the continental breakfast after 10:00 on a Monday holiday was inconvenient for us on the morning of our departure.The location, comfort of the beds, and spaciousness are all as good as described by other reviewers. Also, the second floor rooms, including the one with the fireplace, are wonderful during winter. We played cards one evening there.

<Content>What a Deal! I was on a budget, which is really restraining when visiting NYC. I found this hotel randomly and got a guest room with king bed for $150. I am extremely picky, a nice clean bathroom is a must and the bed should look sleep-friendly. And I was extremely impressed with the Affinia. They have downcomfortors on beds with down pillows and a feather bed. The bathroom was very spacious and clean. Since I didn't book a suite I was concerned that we were going to have a tight room. It was actually fairly spacious for two people. If you are into the bar scene, a few quant bars are right around the corner on 2nd. This is less than a 10 minute walk to Rockafeller Center. I would definitly stay here again. My recommendation is if you are driving, leave early and stay late. The Affinia holds your luggage and parks your car for you so you can get the most out of your trip without being inconvienced. I also recommend the Bryant Park Grill for brunch or dinner, its located right in Time Square in Bryant Park. Also they have cheaper ice skating there than at Rockafeller. ENJOY YOUR STAY!

<Content>Loved this hotel Just a quick note to say that my husband and I stayed at the Affinia from the 16th Dec for 4 nights and had a great time. We had a one bedroom suite on the 17th floor which was very spacious and quiet (loved the pillow menu) The wine and cheese on the 2nd floor lounge was a great touch and i must say i found ALL the staff really friendly nothing was to much trouble.As for the location i was amazed how close the hotel was to lots of attractions,ie Rockefeller center only 10 - 15 min walk Central Park 15-20 min walk. The hotel also has alot of great bars not to far away try the Pig and Whistle on 3rd (turn left out of hotel, left onto 3rd and its about 4-5min along) great for a beer a snack and has Sky Sports!!! All together we had a great time and i am sure if you have booked this hotel you wont be dissapointed, ENJOY!! xx

<Content>We'll Definitely Be Back I travel fairly often to NYC on business and stay at W Hotels, most recently the W New York. We're traveling to New York with our sons, 15 and 19, in May for our daughter's graduation, and we were hoping not to pay what we're accustomed to paying on my expense account for a room/suite that can accommodate us all. I did some checking around and found great reviews for the Affinia 50. We had to be near NY this week and opted to spend our last night in Manhattan to check out this hotel. My husband was circumspect, having developed a taste for the W, and was genuinely amazed. We had a one-bedroom suite on the 21st floor for $299. The room was beyond spacious, comfortable, the bed was wonderful. We ordered room service, which was delivered from the Kimberly Hotel next door. They initially brought 1 hamburger, not 2, but they were so gracious about the mix-up that I don't consider that a misstep. Chances are things aren't always going to go perfect, and the test of great service is the response whe I know it's in a great location and there are plenty of decent restaurants on 2nd Ave. We'll definitely be back in May with the family, and I intend to stay here instead of the W when I return on business.

<Content>We shall return We spent three nights here, largely on Tripadvisor's recommendation, and we were quite impressed. Our room was the least expensive--no suite, no kitchen--but it was a fine size for us. Bathroom small but comfortable enough; loved the shower. Also loved the buckwheat pillows on the pillow menu. Even though we were only on the 4th floor, the street noise was minimal.And the staff--everyone was so helpful and welcoming! The doormen were great, the maids smiled, and the desk staff were efficient and pleasant. All in all, we'll be back...soon!

<Content>SHHHH!!!!! What a GREAT FIND!!!! My kids and I stayed in a Junior Suite with a balcony overlooking the city. The room was very spacious, bright and cheerful. The location of the hotel was great -- we walked everywhere (Rockerfeller Ctr, Times Square, Central Park). There are lots of little restaurants around the hotel (Do a google search of menu pages new york city and get on the website to do a search of restaurants in the East 50's area. The bagel shop, Ess-a-bagel, about a block away from the hotel has fantastic bagels so we went there every morning for breakfast. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly. I could not find a hairdryer in my room and the staff brought a new dryer within 5 minutes. The room was very clean, the kitchen even had an oven, and the shower was great. I would definitely stay here again.I almost didn't want to write this review because I don't want the hotel to become so popular that they start raising their prices. so sshhhh... keep this to yourself.

<Content>Many extras, fine service My wife and I spent an enjoyable weekend at the Affinia 50, one of the better New York hotels we've found in its price range ($159). Our initial room in the hotel was average size for New York hotels -- smaller than rooms in most cities, but then no one goes to New York to sit in a hotel room. Unfortunately, it also had a heater that could not be turned down, but the staff promptly upgraded us to one of their massive suites (which included a small kitchen and large sitting area). This is more room than we needed.Since most visitors probably won't have this sort of luck, it's worth mentioning that, even with a smaller room, this would have been a very pleasant place to stay. The location is excellent: close to the east side shops and restaurants, but only a (brisk) 20 minute walk over to the Broadway theaters. It has a well-equipped fitness center (2 eliptical machines, 2 treadmills, a stairmaster, some bikes, and various weight machines) that is open 24 hours a day. There is no lobby on the first floor, but the second floor has two large sitting rooms, with books, big screen TVs, books, and a gas fireplace -- a very nice place to sit and read the newspaper before setting out. There's also a small room with computers (though the price for internet access is a bit steep).My wife tried the buckwheat pillow and liked it quite a bit. The staff was quite helpful. In addition to the upgrade, the manager bailed us out when we somehow managed to enter a combination into the closet safe that neither of us could remember (I'd always wondered what would happen if you did this), and a broken bed lamp was repaired, without our mentioning it, by housekeeping. The hotel also makes various packets of maps and guidebooks available for those interested in shopping or in museums, while runners can get packet which includes a pedometer along with the maps. Internet connections are available in the rooms and, helpfully enough, there was an ethernet cable in the desk drawer.I had only one very minor complaint: though there are coffee makers in the rooms (always a welcome feature) and while there is a pod coffeemachine available on the second floor except when breakfast was served, the only way to get coffee during breakfast (which will set you back $15 -- we opted for a coffeeshop down the street) is to pay $3.50 a mug. But with Starbucks infesting the neighborhood, this wasn't a major problem.We'd certainly stay here again.

<Content>Pet Friendly My husband and I decided at the last minute to go to NYC for 5 days over XMAS. We were in search for a pet friendly hotel and one with reasonable rates. Affinia 50 offered both. The TripAdvisor reviews helped with our decision as well. We were so glad we made the choice! We had a fantastic stay. Our Jr. Suite was incredibly spacious for NYC standards. The kitchen was an added bonus. The bed was very comfortable (slept like a baby which is rare when we stay in hotels), the comforter and pillows were great as well. The furnishings were stylish and modern. Aveda toiletries were a nice touch in the bathroom. The staff were geniunely friendly and very professional (a rarity these days). They all greeted our dog by name everytime we went thru the lobby and always showered her with attention. They obviously love animals which is cool in my book. The location is outstanding....close to so many things (Central Park, 5th Ave and Madison Ave shopping, Rockefeller, St. Patricks, easy walk to Times Square, subway, etc). The only negatives would be the air temperature in room...it seemed that our thermostat wasn't working correctly. We called to have it looked at, but no one ever came to fix it. So we had the windows open the entire time for relief from the heat (the brisk 40 degree temps outside helped cool us down). The elevators were extremely slow...we waited numerous times for over 5 minutes and at times took the stairs (we were on the 7th floor). I highly recommend Affinia 50....we will definitely stay there again in the future.

<Content>Definitely recommend the Affinia 50! My sister and I stayed at the Affinia 50 the weekend before Christmas. We are both frequent visitors to the city and have experienced accommodations ranging from friends' apartments to numerous hotels. We are also extremely picky, particularly about cleanliness and bedding. We found both the cleanliness and the bedding to be excellent at this hotel. The bed was very comfortable. The pillow menu is always a nice touch. They did a nice job renovating this building. Our room looked modern. The bathroom was on the small side (especially for a junior suite) but this is to be expected in an older building. However, the one thing that stood out the most was the service. Upon arrival, we were actually given a choice - a quiet suite with a balcony on the 16th floor facing the back or one with a great view facing the city but no balcony. We chose the balcony. When we got up to the room, we decided that it was too quiet for a trip to NYC and would rather face the city. The staff was understanding and promptly changed our room. However, the new keys did not work in the new room. We had to go back to the check-in desk. The desk attendant was very apologetic and sent us a bottle of wine for the key mix-up even though we felt at fault for changing our minds about the room! He even called to make sure the room was to our satisfaction.Another testament to the service provided: My sister is allergic to fragrant shampoos and soaps. However, she forgot to pack her own. The front desk provided us with a list of nearby stores that carry the shampoo she needed. In addition, a housekeeper searched the supply closet for shampoo. She wasn't even the housekeeper for our floor!If we had to find a negative about this hotel, it would be the concierge. We inquired about reservations at a particular restaurant. She stated that our restaurant of choice was very new and popular and that it would be impossible to get a reservation. She said she would try to call later in the day when the restaurant opened. I even had to provide her with the phone number to the restaurant! We ended up calling the restaurant ourselves and got a reservation at the time we wanted. Even though we did not find her very helpful, she did appear to be very helpful with another guest regarding shows.Overall, we loved the hotel and had a great time! We had theater tickets we could not use and ended up leaving them for a front desk attendant in appreciation of good service.

<Content>Comfortable Beds, Great Service, Excellent Location! The Affinia 50 is an excellent choice! We stayed for 6 nights and felt like we were coming home after each day of sightseeing. The staff was great and very friendly. They even offered guests cups of fruit punch at the front desk. Ask for the map that is torn from a pad - it's very readable and has subway info. The New York Luncheonette down the street has good food and very reasonably priced. A good sushi restaurant is also nearby.We always had a good nights sleep because of the comfortable beds and down comforters. The room was clean and decorated beautifully. The only thing was the bathroom was tiny! This was probably because there was a small kitchen in the room, too. The best thing is that the Affinia 50 is pretty central. Rockefeller Center, Times Square, 5th Ave. shops, and Museum of Modern Art is within walking distance. The subway is only a block away.We highly recommend the Affinia 50!

<Content>Good, but not great We stayed in a room on the 5th floor -- they have a separate elevator shaft that goes only to the lower floors -- this was an added convenience. The trade off is no view -- the room looked out over A/C equipment in a neigboring building. The room was average size for a NY hotel -- way smaller than at the sister Affinia Dumont on 34th St. They had a pillow menu -- we chose to augment the standard foam pillows with buckwheat pillows. They were great -- I would recommend them -- a very nice feature. There were 3 complaints:* too many mirrors. The bedroom area was dominated by a giant full length mirror in a large wooden frame. Perhaps they thought it would make the room look bigger. The closet door was also a full length mirror. There was another round mirror above the work desk. The bathroom door had another full length mirror. There were 2 more mirrors inside the bathroom (one with magnification features). The room had a total of 3 full length and 3 smaller mirrors. Way too many for such a small space.* noisy toilet. When the toilet flushes it sounds like an explosion has occurred. Luckily the room is well insulated -- we did not hear any other toilets flushing in adjoining rooms.* retrieving luggage left earlier in the day. This took about 20 minutes -- the lobby was not very crowded -- they seemed to have few staff on hand at this time. This delay caused us to miss a connection on leaving NY. Not a great memory to have on the way out of this hotel. Affinia Dumont remains my choice as a better hotel in the same price range.

<Content>Post Marathon...Hotel in Midtown not downtown We stayed at the Affina after the marathon, contrary to to other review the hotel is a midtown hotel, not downtown...50th street is a good spot for the marathon especially if you are flying out the next day as hotel is on East Side of Manhattan closer to Laguardia and JFK. Hotel is relatively less expensive versus other hotels...but it is still expensive $400/night was what we ended paying all in.We had a jr suite with kitchen which is a nice touch if you are staying more than one night. The restuarants on the block are good there is a steak place a few doors down and a Diner as well. I think Smith  Wollensky is nearby as well.The problems revolved around the room and service, when we came in there were two lights out, condsidering the room has 3 lights that was a problem...also the video games did not work which is a problem if you have young children. In terms of service on arrival while I was running my wife had to wait a long, long time to check in everyone was busy doing nothing while she waited and asked repeatedly for help, finally we ordered room service to be delivered at 6 AM b/c we were leaving for flight at 9AM...when we ordered the night before we were advised no problem it will be there between 6 and 6:15....needless to say we were on the phone in the morning where they said they couldn't get it to us until 7:30AM at earliest...we had ordered oatmeal and eggs nothing fancy...Diner down the street came in handy. I would not stay at the hotel again there are many other boutique hotels that I would spend my money at...The Benjamin a little further down for instance...

<Content>Spacious New York Apartment! Just returned from a 4 day stay at Affina 50. I admit to being an extremely fussy traveler and I was so pleased with our experience at this hotel. We truly felt like we were living in an upscale NYC aparmtent. Huge living and bedroom, full kitchen, coffee pot and coffee, down comforters, choice of pillows, etc. But best of all, the staff was friendly! Even though everyone was suffering through the transit strike, the staff never lost their warmth and accessibilty. (unlike the W where you feel like you are bothering an upcoming starlet.) Location was perfect for shopping, Radio City, etc. (Don't miss the Top of the Rock, beautiful) Great bagel shop around the corner. We will be back!

<Content>Great, Great, Great! Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Affinia 50 at it was excellent. In a great location which was close to bloomingdales, grand central station, 5th avenue shops, top of the rock and times square, just about everywhere was walkable from this area. After having a problem with our room booking when we arrived ( our booking agents fault not affinia's) they assured us that they would get us the appropriate room the following day. The suite was fantastic, had a small kitchen but had everything you needed. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was fantastic. We had a sleeping/lounge area which was extremely comfortable. While we were in NYC the transit strike was on and the hotel kept us informed of what was happening, even organising car-pooling to get guests to the airports. They printed letters and gave them to guests explaining that they may be understaffed due to workers being unable to get transport, however we never found this to be the case and after a long days shopping our room was always made up for us to come back to. They even cleaned our dishes! I found the staff attitude to be very friendly and customer orientated. The service was also very personal, something i like in a hotel. Especially in such a difficult time for the staff with the strike.  The recpetion was very helpful in recommending restaurants and Azure and the New York Lunchonette were great for breakfast. The hotel doesnt have a restaurant but this wasnt a problem due to the vast number of good quality (some high priced, others not so, so look around)restuarants in the area. The bed is one of the most comfortable around and there is also a pillow menu which was a nice touch.  Room service is also available with the restaurant next door providing the catering, however we did not use this service. The hotel provided us with a late check out since our flight out wasnt til late and we used the club room to relax in before catching a cab. The club room provided cheese and wine between 6pm and 7pm monday to friday and serves a continental breakfast buffet for around $15 everyday if you decide you're too tired to walk round the corner for breakfast. The Affinia 50 was a fantastic hotel for our first (and definately not last!) visit to a very busy NYC. It was a relaxing haven to rest after a day of sightseeing and shopping. I can highly recommend it and we will definately be back!

<Content>Great Hotel + Staff + Location = We'll Be Back My wife  daughter (21) had never been to the City, so I wanted their first trip to be outstanding. I can't imagine picking a better property than Affinia 50. Here goes: POSITIVES: Staff is very friendly, helpful and courteous. My wife had a minor medical problem and the hotel immediately contacted their oncall physician who immediately called our room, made a referal to another DR. who called and took care of the problem. Folks, it doesn't get any better than that! The decor is modern but not sterile.My daugher, majoring in interior design, was mightly impressed. We stayed in room 1011 which was well decorated, enormous (20'X30'), and pretty quite. The room also has a small kitchen that was useful. The maid service was perfect and our one room service meal was ontime and exactly as we had ordered. NOTE* This hotel doesn't have a restaurant or bar, but there is an excellent restauran/bar next door (George's). This hotel is only 2 blocks from Rockefeller center  about 4-5 blocks from Madison/Fifth Ave. The hotel does have a guests lounge on the 2nd floor with fireplace, comfortable furniture  big plasma TVs, newspapers, etc. NEGATIVES: They offer buffet breakfast in the 2nd floor lounge for $15 but in our opinion it wasn't worth the price. You can get free coffee AFTER 10:00am; I tried to get a cup before 10:00 and they wanted to charge me $15! There is a free wine  cheese gathering from 6:00-7:00 but that is such a narrow timeframe, we somehow managed to miss it every day. It ought to be expanded to at least 2 hrs. The lavatory in the bathroom is small  the sink awakwardly placed. These are pretty small negatives, I've already recommended this hotel to 2 friends and I look forward to staying there again. Maybe they'll have beefed up the breakfast buffet and extended the wine  cheese time by then. Great place to stay!

<Content>Great Stay What a fantastic surprise! We needed to book a room at the last minute and called this hotel based on other trip advisor recommendations. Everything they say is true! The amazing part was that we had actually stayed here when it was Plaza Fifty. The Affinia has done a great job renovating the hotel. It is very clean and comfortable. Modern and Sleek design with great customer service. We couldn't have been more pleased and would absolutely stay there again.

<Content>Loved this hotel This hotel is excellent, a real gem. You will not go wrong selecting this hotel. It is located in an excellent location close to all attractions in New York City. Moreover, it is located a stones throw from many restaurants and the hotel stafff are more than capable of directing guests to excellent eateries within a short distance from the hotel. The doormen were outstanding and all the hotel staff were great. We were in room 1905 and could barely hear the traffic below. This hotel made our Thanksgiving memorable.

<Content>Great Stay at Affinia 50 We stayed at the Affinia 50 for 5 nights with our two kids the week before Thanksgiving. Most of the staff was fairly young but they were very nice and always EXTREMELY helpful.  We had a room with 2 queen beds. The room was really a very nice size with plenty of extra space and good closet and drawer space and a nice size tv. There was also a small kitchenette which we didn't really use, but liked the full size frig (I hate those tiny hotel refrigerators filled with so much stuff they want you to buy you can't even keep a bottle of water cold!). The only negative was that the bathroom was fairly small, especially for 4 people, but we managed. They had a nice Club Room on the 2nd floor, and it turned out the breakfast (not included) there wasn't bad, with hard boiled eggs, good bagels, croissants, great pineapple and strawberry skewers, lox and cold cereals. I think we ended up eating there 2x for breakfast. It was particularly handy when we needed an early start.It is in a good location. Was very quiet, we never had any trouble with noise from the street or any other room. Would definitely consider staying there again.

<Content>Terrific We arrived in NYC after dark and easily found the Affinia 50 hotel. We were greeted by the doorman, bags handled, and checked in all within 15 minutes of arrival. The room (a 1 bdrm suite) was very spacious, clean and featured several nice touches. A small kitchen was handy although I would gladly give up some kitchen space for more bathroom space. The bathroom is VERY small. The beds were quite comfortable and the hotel offers a pillow menu to augment the pillows already in the room. There is a club room on the 2nd floor which makes a nice sitting area in between NYC activities. The excercise facility is adequate. The location of the hotel was perfect for our activities. Lots of good places to eat nearby. Overall we would say the Affinia 50 has it right and will definitely stay again. The staff to a person was pleasant, helpful, and available when needed, but not generally visible (which is the way we like it). When comparing room rates for other hotels we felt like we received a very good value, although NYC is the capital of price shock.

<Content>Loved this hotel I stayed at this hotel with 4 girlfriends sight unseen. We were so pleased with our suite, it was very large and comfortable. The staff is incredible, the best customer service possible. The doormen, especially Steve who worked later in the day were great. They always had a smile for us and would welcome us back. We were in a great location in a nice neighbourhood and the price was great too. The little diner down the street was incredible and we ate there at least 4 times. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We will defintely stay there again.

<Content>Great Location for the Marathon My fianc茅 and I were in NYC for the marathon and found the Affina 50 to be a great location. It was near the 51st and Lex subway station. 50th street is quiet and there was a great club downstairs. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel gave you a choice of pillows. The price was reasonable for downtown Manhattan. The staff was friendly and helpful.We stayed in a guest room, so there was just a refrigerator and a coffee pot. We had a room on the fifth floor that was quiet, but no view. Monday through Thursday on the 2nd floor, the hotel hosts a wine and cheese reception from 6-7 PM. The 2nd floor has two large rooms with comfortable couches and chairs to sit and talk.Internet wise, each room has a high speed connection and on the 2nd floor there are two computers where you can purchase time.Overall, we had a great stay at the Affina 50 and would recommend this hotel to our friends.

<Content>Loved the Affinia 50 My friend and I stayed at the Affinia 50 in August for four nights during our annual trip to NYC. We usually stay in the Times Square area, but decided to try a new locale. The Affinia was wonderful. The doormen (Lenny and Andy) were very nice and helpful. The front desk staff were extremely pleasant. We had a two-bed room with a small kitchen. Bathroom was stocked with Aveda products. Nice! The beds were like heaven, so comfy. The hotel was very quiet. We could not hear the other guests at all. Location is quite a walk from Times Square. Subway nearby. Market around the corner was good for breakfast, kind of expensive though. The hotel next door has a breakfast buffet for $12. We didn't realize that until our last day. Would definitely try that as we spent that much at the market for just a muffin, fruit, and coffee. There is also a McDonald's around the corner for a quick meal. Hotel was very clean and comfortable. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Loved the Affinia 50!

<Content>Excellent hotel The Affinia 50 was a great stay. The staff were friendly and efficient, the rooms well decorated and spacious, the location a stones throw from lots of attractions and shopping.The extra nice touches were the small kitchens in each room, great for making coffee or snacks and the executive lounge on the 2nd floor where you can sprawl out on comfy sofas wtch the large screen plasma TV or check your E Mail (cost extra)If you are catering for yourself there is a great deli on third ave just one block from the hotel (turn left on third) or a large grocery store (associated) one block over of 48th and 2nd.My only critisism is the cost, however compared to the cost of comparable hotels in the area it is very good value for money.I would stay there again.

The room was spotless and nicely furnished and the service was great. One of the recommended restaurants was not to our liking but that was the only problem the entire time. Would stay here again and recommend it.

<Content>Affinia is the Best Affordable Hotel in NYC I am pleased to be writting my 5-star approval of the Affinia 50. At the height of the travel season in late August, my fiancee and I stayed at a suite (approx. 625 sq. ft.) for only $150 a night. Typically when I booked through Expedia the hotel would give you the last available rooms...not the best. However, I called a few days in advance and again the day of to find they accomodated us in a suite for no extra charge, additionally they gave us a requested view! With no hassle they took care of all my requests. Three other big advantages to the Affinia 50: Its excellent location a few blocks east of Time Square and the center of Midtown; the outstanding, helpful staff who arranged cars, flowers, etc; third, the 2nd floor breakfast cafe and lounge--great for getting an early bite before meetings. In conclusion this hotel, thanks to its staff, have made me a permanent customer on my trips to NYC. Thanks Affinia 50!

<Content>Girls weekend- great find Most average hotel rooms were booked Oct. 16th weekend. My father had stayed here on buisness and thought it would be great! We had a nurses reunion with 4 friends reuniting and the suites could not be better!! Plenty of room (larger than many NYC apts! 650 sq. ft.) We had happy hour in the living room, coffee in the kitchen am, plenty of room for 4 women to stay. Great location, midtown and Park /Madison ave. shopping, a brisk walk to times square, second ave. Irish pubs or if you prefer Whiskey Blue W lounge a stone throw away! Note- we live in the burbs of NYC and come in often. This place is a find!!! Shhhh, don't tell everyone about our secret place or we may not get a reservation when we need one!

<Content>a fabulous weekend Our weekend stay at the Affinia was absolutely fabulous. The staff was both professional and friendly, the accomodations were perfect, and the location was the best.Every person who worked there was so helpful and made us feel very comfortable. They suggested places to visit and eat and the best way to get around.The room was clean, spacious and nicely decorated. Even the bed linens and pillows were cozy.Everyone made us feel special and we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Affinia50 is a great place to stay in NYC My husband and I stayed at the Affinia50 on E. 50th Street in NYC this past weekend at the recommendaion of a friend. The hotel is well located within walking distance of St. Patricks, NBC and Broadway. We were in Room 503. When we arrived (2 hours later than expected because of the torrential rain!), we were greeted with a very pleasant Welcome Home from the doorman. Once inside, we were offered punch and set up with our room immediately. The room itself was large (unusual in the City), clean and nicely appointed. Every time we contacted anyone in the hotel we were met with a can do attitude and a pleasant smile. This hotel has the same issue most older NYC hotels have -- the rooms do not have individual heating and air controls so your room can get very warm if the air is turned off in the hotel -- which was the case while we were there. I called to complain that my room was too warm and housekeeping sent me a fan within 5 minutes. I stay in NYC several times a year and I can tell you that I have never stayed at a hotel where I have received such nice and efficient treatment. I will stay there again. This hotel gets 5 stars from me and my recommendation as a premier place to stay.

<Content>Terrific Stay! We stayed in a one bedroom suite for 5 nights and absolutely loved it. There was an unbelievable amount of room in the living/dining area and a fully-equipped separate kitchen. The staff was very friendly and helpful. During the week, we enjoyed complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings. The location is perfect and walkable to virtually every attraction in New York. And, if you don't care to walk, there is a subway with 3 lines just a block away. Around the corner is a terrific deli/quick stop that has an incredible selection of hot foods 24 hours a day. I will definitely stay at the Affinia 50 when I return to New York.

<Content>Great Place in NY I just came back from NY and had a great tiem with my husband and kids. Found Affinia 50 to be a comfortable place with a great location and extremely helpful staff. We not only felt welcomed but also knew the staff would take care of us. Our room was great. Except for a loose crew on the bathroom sink, everything else was perfect. We used the kitchen and took beautiful pics on the balacony. The children absolutely loved it. Oh...and again, it is such a good location. I would probably try to stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel Booked this hotel after reading various reviews on this site - the hotel more than lived up to expectations - we found it clean friendly and very nicely decorated It it ideally situated near to a couple of subway stations or about 20 mins walk to Times SquareThe room itself was large with a king bed, modern decor and a decent sized bathroom - there was no view but that didn't matter as it was just somewhere to rest at the end of the dayThe bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in - just what you need after a long day sightseeing - BLISSIf we return to NY will definately stay here again

<Content>'Welcome Home' We stayed at the Affinia 50 from the 26th-28th August. We had been in New York the previous week at The Bentley and had travelled to Las Vegas in between.The Affinia 50 was much nicer than the Bentley, but as another tripadvisor user had stated, we also booked a Studio Suite and expected a kitchen but we did not receive one. We didn't ask to move though as we were only there for 2 nights. The morning we arrived, we got there at about 8am due to an overnight flight from Vegas. Both me and my fiance were very tired and we had not booked an early check in. The hotel were very accomodating and put us in a room straight away for no extra charge. The room was quite spacious and had a classy boutique feel about it. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a pillow menu you could choose from - although we didn't partake in this.We did not eat at the hotel so we cannot comment on the breakfasts. There is a little deli around the corner that sells everything! so if you fancy a late night snack or some breakfast, then pop in there.We did find a lovely mexican restaurant around the corner that did the best chilli I have ever tasted and frozen margeritas and mojitos for $3 - they were like rocket fuel!!!! Definately go there as it was great and cheap!The Affinia was a very nice hotel, the staff were helpful and friendly. Every time you came back through the doors the doorman said 'Welcome home'! Tacky, but nice all the same.I would recommend this hotel if you can get a cheap rate, otherwise it is pretty pricey.

<Content>Incredibly Spacious east side Hotel! Simply put, the Affina 50 is a very nice place. As a frequent traveler to NYC , I have stayed in the following hotels: Westin Times Square, Millennium Broadway, Holiday Inn 57th st., Hotel Pennsylvania (worst ever), and now the Affina 50. Location is great, besides being away from times square. Many other places around, including good food. Also, this is the biggest room I have had in the city. Excellent king bed, spacious bathroom. Our suite included a fully equipped kitchen as well. Our first night of our stay, we stopped at the grocery store around the corner and got some food items. We made cookies in the room that night, and made french toast and eggs the next morning. Very comfortable place that really feels like home. Our room did not have a view at all, facing a brick building, but we didn't mind because it was very quiet for being on the 6th floor. Excellent storage space in the room for everything you could bring. Also, very nice couch and chair with ottoman to relax.Pros: Priced Right, Great bed and bath, friendly staff, VERY SpaciousCons: $9.95/day for high speed internetWonderful Place, Highly Reccomended! Cheers!

<Content>Affinia 50 - fab We booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this website and it more than lived up to its reputation. We had requested a king suite, preferrably on a high floor and were not disappointed. Ended up in a room with two queen beds on the 14th floor so was much bigger than a king would have been. Although the kitchen was 'dated' (as someone mentioned recently) it was perfectly adequate - not that we made much use of it when we discovered an amazing deli round the corner. The hotel was in a fantastic location. Found a couple of good, cheap (for New York) bars nearby. Worth checking out the FUBAR - free popcorn! and the burgers at The Press Room were excellent. If you like mexican Mama Mexicos just along East 50th is fabulous.If you have time go to the Bronx Zoo - a nice relaxing change of pace for a day.Can't wait to go back and would defo stay in the Affinia again.

<Content>Great hotel but be careful of what you book!! We stayed at Affinia 50 hotel for 5 days end August, early September. I'd booked directly with the hotel 5 months previously and requested a Studio Suite (having seen floor plans on the net decided that the studio was a good size with small kitchen so we could do our thing for breakfast) and also requested a quiet room on a high floor. When we arrived we were given a room on 4th floor overlooking 3rd Ave. Arriving in the room we found there was no kitchen, only a bar fridge and coffee maker, no table and chairs or sofa. We queried this and were told that we would have to pay US$30 extra per night to have kitchen facilities. Also they couldn't do anything about not being on a high floor.........we were told perhaps if we inquired the next morning someone may be able to help. The outside noise was incredible that night so enquired next morning and were shown a dark room on floor 19, wedged next to the lift. We opted to stay where we were and put up with the noise at night, after all we were in NY. The room itself was great, lovely soft bed and quite roomy with great bathroom. What annoyed me was the fact that I had booked so early and was told my requests had been noted and would be fulfilled. I even emailed when we were leaving for our holiday to confirm details and was assured that everything was in order. I really think we were just given a room, not a suite and were charged suite price. We had a great time in New York and would got back to that hotel again but I'm still disappointed with the treatment we got.

<Content>Affinia 50 I have stayed here 2x's Once when it was the Plaza 50, and once since it became the Affinia 50. Both times I LOVED IT!!! This past April I took my husband, and he loved the location. So close to the subway, great little diner a couple of doors down. Super friendly staff!!! I would love to stay again, but they have raised their rates so much.

<Content>Excellent Boutique Hotel!! Hotel was fantastic! Friendly people, awesome padded comfortable beds, better sleep than home. Pillow menu (pillows on the bed are wonderful) but you had a choice of non-allergenic, buckwheat, memory foam. Nice modern decor. THE BEST LOCATION!! We stayed in room 402, which was in the back of the hotel and very quiet. If you stay on the first 5 floors, you can use a side elevator and avoid lines that I read about in other posts. Hotel is on 50th and 3rd. Walking distance to U.N., Rockefeller Center, etc. W Hotel across the street with bar Whiskey Blue, which is Rande Gerber's place (Cindy Crawford's husband). Dress if you are going to stop in on a weekend, it was a fab sex-in-the-city crowd on a Saturday.I grew up in NYC, and Ess-a-Bagel is authentic bagel place that is at 830 3rd Ave (About 1 1/2 blocks away - cross the street at 3rd, walk left, it's on the block). They boil the bagels, then bake them. Man who owns the place was in there this morning (Sunday) - he cut me some belly lox - which is saltier than Nova lox - YUM! Tried the chopped herring and whitefish salad - the best - gotta love my city and the food!

<Content>The Affinia 50 Feels Like Home! After weeks of internet research, and reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor, I decided to book the Affinia 50 for a vacation stay with 3 other female family members. What a great choice! We arrived just a little past noon, and the doorman saw us from the corner with our luggage and quickly came with a cart to greet us and help us get settled. (All of the staff members were helpful, friendly and polite.) Check-in was quick and easy, and even though it was just past noon, our one-bedroom suite on the 9th floor was ready. We were so surprised when we walked in and saw the size of the suite! The living room and dining area were quite large, and the kitchen, even though small, had a full-sized refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, dishes and a toaster. The beds were big and comfy, and the bathroom wasn't huge, but was bigger than most other NYC hotels I've stayed in. We really felt like we had our own little apartment in the city. Everything was very clean, and the abundance of Aveda products was a nice touch. There was even a fitness room and a nice lounge on the second floor that I wish we'd had more time to enjoy, but we were out exploring most of the time! The midtown east location was great - lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. Ess-a-Bagel was great for getting breakfast bagels, and a little shop called Azure had milk, fruit, cereals, soft drinks, etc. to take back to the room. The walk to the Times Square area only takes about 15 minutes, and there are subway lines close-by that get you anywhere you need to go. I would definitely recommend the Affinia 50, and I would stay there again without hesitation. When you walk into the lobby, the doorman always says, Welcome home, and that's just how we felt - at home!

<Content>Affinia 50 was excellent I read other reviews on tripadvisor to help me decide to stay here. The room was modern and comfortable, the 2 queen beds were more comfortable than my bed at home (which is never the case). The bathroom although tiny was wonderfully decorated and clean. The location was the best, just a 15- 20 minute walk to Time Square, and the walk is safe and interesting. My husband and I and our 2 teenage boys stayed for 2 nights, I will recommend to all of my family and friends.I Love New York and I Love Affinia 50.

<Content>Overall, The Best Place To Stay In NYC I stayed in the Affinia 50 from July 20th to July 25th 2005.We had a party of 8 so had two rooms on the 15th and 22nd floors. I've stayed here several times over the years both on business trips and with my family and children. Ownership has recently changed from the Manhattan East Suites to the Affinia Group. The hotel has also recently undergone a major upgrade and the rooms are now more plush and comfortable than previously. The hotel is excellent in almost every respect. The rooms are spacious (although there's a big variation in the sizes of rooms at the same price!). The bedrooms are outstanding. Huge comfortable beds with tasteful furnishings and even two dressing gowns. The location.... well it's unbeatable in the big apple. within walking distance of Midtown shopping, Broadway, Bloomies, and Grand Central Station. The only downside was the technology in the room. After the recent major refurbishment, I would have expected flat screen TVs instead of the antique monsters in the living room and bedrooms. I would also have expected free wireless internet acces instead of a $10 per day charge. Someone recently mentioned a 2-bedroom suite but I'm certain there are no 2-bed suites in the Affinia 50. Some lovely nearby restaurants and bars within a block also helped. All in all a great experience.

<Content>The best place to stay in NY Our stay at the Affinia 50 could not have been any better. The customer service was superb and the location was unbeatable. The free wine and cheese in the evening was a nice touch, as well as the pillow menu. Great facilities and very updated!!! The comfy bed was also a plus. We are a Swedish/American couple and travel often and I have to say that this is one of the best hotels we've been to in a long time :)

<Content>Less than Perfect We stayed at the Affinia 50 this past weekend and were both slightly disappointed with our accomodations. When we booked on line with the Affinia website, we asked for a non smoking Studio Suite with two queen beds and the galley kitchen. We called two weeks in advance to ask for a non smoking room higher than the 5th floor. When we got to the hotel, we were given a king bed room with no kitchen, just a refrigerator on the 5th floor. They said that we could move the next day to another room, but that was too much of a hassle being gone all day and coming back to re pack your belongings and move, so we stayed in the king room. The air worked well in the room, but the noise level from the streets was tremendous, not to mention the fire alarm going off at 5 AM in the morning for 1/2 hour. Other than the hotel, New York was great and definately try and go to the Chelsea flea market and Ess-e-bagel down the street from the Affinia.

<Content>Great place to stay I recently stayed at the Affinia 50 for my mom's birthday. The hotel is very clean and all the staff was friendly and accomodating. I called ahead of time to ask a question and mentioned that it was my mom's birthday, and they had a card and some candies waiting for us in our room, which I thought was a nice touch. There was a mixup with our original room (it had only one bed and not two, as we requested) but they fixed our problem right away and gave us a room with two queen beds and a kitchenette. The room was incredibily spacious (especially by Manhattan hotel standards) and the beds were the most comfortable I've ever slept on. The Club Room features newspapers, books, games and internet access, all for free. I really enjoyed my stay and will stay here again. My only complaints would be that there was no sponge in the kitchenette for cleaning dishes (the kitchen comes fully stocked with utensils, btw), our face towels weren't replaced when the room was cleaned, and it was a tad noisy - I heard someone sneeze when I was in the bathroom, could hear doors closing, etc. If you're not used to urban noises (sirens, buses, cars honking, etc.) you may find it tough to sleep - the street noise wasn't terrible, but I live in NYC, so I'm used to it! The location is great as it's easy to get anywhere else in the city without dealing with the huge crowds of people in Times Square, and you have the B49 bus right outside your door, the E, V and 6 trains down the block, and good food nearby, such as Ess-a-Bagel and Smith and Wollensky's. I highly recommend this hotel for your NYC visit.

<Content>Our favorite This was my second stay at the Affinia. Our one bedroom suite was spacious with wonderful views from the balconies. We felt like we were coming home. Sammy is the best doorman in NY. I'm headed back with my mom and sister in December. This is definitely our home in NYC. Thanks Affinia for such a warm, comfortable hotel.

<Content>Lived up to expectations! We stayed at the Affinia from the 27th to the 31st july 2005. We booked the hotel after reading the reviews on this site. I requested a quiet room (we live in the Shetland Islands and are NOT used to a lot of noise) and we were duly booked into a 1 bedroom suite on the 10th floor. We had a wonderful view and a very nice room. The maid service was excellent as was the staff on the front desk and the doorman (who managed to sort out our very late taxi to the airport). We enjoyed the wine and cheese and the children loved the fitness centre - we should have made more use of these facilities.There is an excellent deli around the corner called Esa bagel and within a couple of minutes walk a small supermarket. Having these on your doorstep made good use of the kitchen facilities in the room.We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit New York and wants to stay in an excellent location at a price that does not reflect the quality of the accomodation.

<Content>50/50 rating for Affinia 50 My husband and I stayed at the Affinia 50 from July 26-30. We both had mixed feelings...super great location. Midtown is an ideal spot, central, bustling, safe, and fun. We requested a non-smoking room, but for some reason the entire floor seemed to be occupied by HEAVY smokers. We just bought a scented candle, since there were no other rooms available. The bed was indeed one of the comfiest ever, and the pillow menu was a fun diversion. Most of the reviews praised the staff for being extra nice and attentive. We did not have that expirience. The staff were professional, to be sure, but not warm, fuzzy, or exeptional in any way. All in all, the price was good, the room was clean, and we enjoyed our stay in the big apple, but next time we might shell out a bit more dough in hopes of having better service.

<Content>Comfortable and convenient Our family (parents and two kids) stayed here for one night. I wish I'd arranged to stay there longer but I'd already booked and paid for three nights at the Holiday Inn on 57th - that was very, very ordinary by comparison. The desk and lobby staff at Affinia 50 were very welcoming. We just crashed there on the two king-sized beds - they were so comfortable. We didn't really use the kitchen but I can say that both the kitchen and the bathroom were a good size and of a reasonable standard. The kids loved the fact that Starbucks (still a novelty!) was just around the corner and we loved the food from Azure. This deli is just great. The hotel is close to 5th Ave and subways. E 50th St just felt a nicer area than W 57th where we spent the next 3 nights also. Incidentally we spent our very last night in NYC a week or so later in the Affinia across from Madison Sq Gardens - even better than Affinia 50 IMO!!!

<Content>Too Good To Be True We selected Affinia 50 based on the outstanding reviews on this website. After our recent stay we realized these reviews were overrated and inaccurate and felt compelled to give a more realistic review. Also, the amenities indicated were exaggerated. Example, a galley kitchen with a refrigerator turned out to be a bar cooler with no kitchen in any way.While confirming our reservation we had requested a room on a higher floor and were told it would not be a problem. At check we were informed otherwise, that our reservation was only good for floors 1-5. After our obvious discontent the clerk supposedly upgraded us to a studio room on the 19th floor. We gladly offerd him a $ tip for doing so. While unpacking the room felt warm. We lowered the thermostat, upon returning to the room 5 hours later the room was still warm. We contacted the front desk, the maintenance man arrived and indicated he had repaired the problem. 2 hours later and the room was still warm, the a/c was not repaired! We reguested another room and was told the only available room was a regular roomon the 4th floor. It turns out this room was no different from our upgraded room except it had functioning a/c. The attitude of the staff was by no means hospitable, they were more like indifferent. We had to ask for fresh towels and soap? On our last night a notice was put under our room door indicating the entire floor would be without a/c or hot water the next day as major repairs were needed! We requested a 1pm checkout, was first told they could not do this as they were sold out. When asked how they could check people into rooms with no a/c or hot water the clerk repiled oh, okay you can have a late check out, with an attitude like she was doing us a favor! Thanks Affinia for a miserable stay! Be forewarned readers!

<Content>A welcome home every time We stayed at the Affinia 50 from July 16 to 21st. I had booked through the hotel after they had agreed to match the Expedia rate. We had a king junior suite and it was very spacious with a small kitchen which was well equipped. We did face onto another building which meant for no view but also meant quiet nights. All staff were very friendly especially Rome one of the doormen. We only made the wine hour once but it was very pleasant. The Gray line tour picked up just around the corner at the Waldorf and other buses and subway were very convenient. Must mention the deli Azure around the corner. They sold a magnificent array of foods and were open 24 hours. Agree with other posters, why pay more for a room you are in so little. If you appreciate good service and value for money the Affinia 50 is for you

<Content>Welcome home indeed After hours of deliberation over the many hotels available in New York City my boyfriend and I (well moreso I!) decided on the Affinia 50. After reading all of the extremely useful reviews on tripadvisor we took the plunge and managed to secure ourselves a great deal for the 4 nights we spent from July 16th to July 20th. Not only were we pleasantly surprised by the size of the room (which some people have mentioned previously as being small), but the overall decor and atmosphere of the boutique, club hotel was more than we both expected. The staff will greet you with welcome home on your arrival, the room is a cool haven from the opressive humidity outside; the bed is a cocoon which will soothe your tired muscles from all of the sightseeing and shopping which takes place in New York and the Aveda bathroom products will invigorate you to do it all over again! However most property decisions are made upon location and Affinia 50 is a winner. Close enough to walk into Times Square within 10 minutes, close to the beautiful Grand Central Station and very close to Saks and all of the Fifth Avenue stores. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to stay within their budget, have a brilliant and accesible location but most of all to feel like they have got more for their money. There is so much to see and do in NYC which means that the amount of time actually spent in your room is very little and spending more than necessary on a room you won't be in to me seems like a bad investment. The Affinia 50 is by no means a no frills place, for the money you pay I guarantee you will be more than impressed-we certainly were and can't wait to go again!

<Content>Nice Hotel at a Modest Price My family (wife and two daughters) stayed at the Affinia 50 for five nights in July, 2005. It is an outstanding hotel for the price. We had a one bedroom suite which included a nice sized separate bedroom with a very comfortable King bed, sitting area/living room with a fold out sofa bed and dinette, a small kitchen with a small range/oven, very small microwave, full-sized refrigerator and a dish-washer. The kitchen was equipped with plates/glasses/silverware for four. There are tons of shelves/closets/dressers for clothes and stuff. We requested a King bed, non-smoking, room on a high floor with a nice view. We got three out of the four - the view was a brick wall of the neighboring building. The front desk said they could get us a view room the next day for the remainder of our stay but we declined, once we had unpacked and settled in. One good thing about no view, it sure kept the street noise down - it was amazingly quiet for a mid-town Manhattan hotel. The rooms were nicely appointed with large TVs in the bedroom and sitting room. The bathroom was small and needed more shelf space (especially with a wife and two daughers!), but the shower was first rate. The kitchen was very small and the microwave was just large enough to handle microwave popcorn or a cup of hot water - but it was more than adequate for breakfast which was a lot easier and less expensive than having the family eat breakfast out every morning. The staff was friendly and helpful. There is a nice lounge on the second floor with a large screen TV, board games, coffee, newspapers and computers for internet access (there is also broadband access in the room). They have a wine and cheese happy hour Mon. - Thurs. that is free for guests. One of the best things about the Affinia 50 is its great location - on the corner of 50th and Third Avenue. It is one short block to the 50th and Lexington Ave. subway station which can take you just about anyplace in the city. In one day we traveled from the hotel to Ellis Island from the southern tip of Manhattan, the World Trade Center site, South Street seaport and my old neighborhood in the Northwest corner of the Bronx and back to the hotel for dinner at a nearby steak place - all on the subway using our 7 day fixed price/all you can ride pass (available at the Times Square Visitor Center on Bwy and 46th). It is also just a few blocks from Rockefeller Center (and the Today show!), Radio City Music Hall, Times Square/Theater District and dozens of first rate restaurants. Within a block of the hotel is a Smith and Wollensky Steak House, a very nice restaurant called La Magnette and another steal place - O'neil's. Also, there is a small grocery story around the corner and full-sized, 24 hr. Associated about four blocks away on Second Ave. Oh, there are two Starbucks within a block of the hotel. By booking several months ahead online and paying for the entire stay in advance, we got a rate of $229 per night ($189 for the first night). It would be hard to find another room (let alone a suite) in that area for under $400 per night. We were very pleased with the Affinia and look forward to returning in the future.

<Content>We Didn't Want to Leave! When considering where to stay in New York (our first time visiting the city) we chose the Affinia 50 because of the praises and details we read at Trip Advisor. Because of the very detailed reviews, we knew just what to expect at the Affinia 50, and we weren't disappointed! We stayed in a Junior Suite and we were amazed at the size of the room. The room was huge and extremely comfortable, and we made good use of the full kitchen almost every day we were there. There is a lovely market with very reasonable prices just a couple of blocks away, so getting groceries was hassle-free. The bed was so nice, we're considering purchasing one from the website; and my husband is still raving about the pillow menu. The hotel is a distance from the theater district and other attractions, but the subway is just a couple of blocks away. We took the subway everywhere and never felt lost or unsafe. The staff at the Affinia 50 treated us like family. We felt extremely welcome and pampered during our stay! The second floor lounge is huge, with two big plasma screen TVs, games, comfy chairs, and breakfast or wine and cheese, depending on what time of day you are there. New York was amazing, and the Affinia 50 was by far the best hotel we've ever experienced! Thank you, Trip Advisor, for steering us in the direction of the Affinia 50.

<Content>Almost good We stayed at the Affinia 50 last night, in a studio suite with a king bed on the fourth floor. I had been expecting wonderful things based on the reviews here, but I'm sorry to say that our stay wasn't quite so pleasant.The hotel itself is quite nice, and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. Our problem with the hotel is that our room (408) was on the fourth floor and we could hear traffic noise pretty much all night. It didn't matter that the AC was on, when there's a New Yorker leaning on his horn at 2 a.m., you're going to hear it. I don't really fault the hotel for that, this is New York after all, and you have to expect some noise.The bed was very comfortable, as many of the reviewers have noted, but the pillows were not. We didn't get a chance to order from the pillow menu because we were too busy running around NYC. It was pretty much only until we got home at 11 pm (though perhaps we should have just called housekeeping then) that we tried the bed, and we were both too tired to want to have any hotel staff show up.That was really the first time we were in our room since checking in, and we began to notice a few problems. You really could hear the street noise from the 4th floor, even through the thick windows. Worse, you could hear the toilet flushing -- from next door and from above. There aren't cisterns on these toilets, so they employ some kind of high pressure flushing very similar in sound to those on airplanes. It was actually pretty scary the first time we flushed, and it was definitely scary when one of our neighbors flushed when we were trying to sleep.But the toilet sounds weren't the only problem with the plumbing. As I was brushing my teeth, I watched in awe as the sink slowly filled with dirty water, from the drain up. I could hear the sink and water running from upstairs, and figured there must be some problem with the drainage system. That would explain why, upon checking in, we found tiny flecks of various dark cruddy material lining the sink. At first, we thought they were decorative designs, but really, it was backwash. With toothbrush in hand, I stood and watching the horrid backflow slowly fill the sink. It didn't overflow, and eventually, it went back down, but I had to use the tub to do my brushing and flossing. (That's pretty gross, too, I admit.)When I made the reservation, I asked for a quiet room away from the elevators and stairs. And I was glad we did have a room far away, since the doors aren't very soundproofed and they tend to slam shut pretty loudly. There's an express elevator for the first to five floors, and on our floor, there was a room right next to that elevator. I felt bad for the people in that room, since they must have been subject to all kinds of inane early morning and late night hallway conversation. If you are the kind of person who needs to sleep in complete darkness, this is not the hotel for you. Or don't get our room. There was only one large window, but the curtains for it left large gaps in the middle and to the sides. In the morning, we were awakened by the light coming in those large seams, as well as the violent flushing of the room next to ours. I am usually a very easy-going traveler. I don't throw hysterics or fits, and understand that some things are out of the hotel's control. But I have to say that I was pretty disappointed with our room at the Affinia 50, considering I paid $250 for it (which for NYC prices, isn't much, I know) but for $250, I expect to be able to sleep the night through without hearing traffic noises, bathroom noises or worry that the sink is overflowing with my upstairs neighbor's used Aveda mouthwash.Or, I don't expect to find needles on the floor. No, I'm not talking about syringes, but the kinds of needles that hold together a dress shirt in packaging. I found three pins on the floor, fortunately, I did not find them the hard way. One thing I did forget to mention is that my wife thought she could hear the neighbors having sex from the bathroom. I don't know if the neighbors were in their bathroom and the pipes were carrying the sounds of their carrying ons, but that was not something I needed to know. Or perhaps it was the TV and the permium entertainment options which so many hotels depend on for revenue. Maybe someone upstairs ordered the $29.99 midnight to noon porn-a-thon and was making sure he got his money's worth. Despite all these issues, we did have a great time in New York. I'm actually willing to stay at the Affinia 50 again, provided that when I make the reservation, I get a high floor room. It was nice to have the extra space, but I really would have liked to have slept well last night. As it is, it's 9:20 now, and I'm ready for bed.

<Content>We Loved the Affinia We stayed at the Affinia 50 with our two children, ages 7 and 9, for our first visit to the Big Apple. My daugher loved the dream pillow and tea set provided by the hotel as part of the American Girl package. We were allowed an early check in when we arrived on July 4th - which was great and not expected. The hotel met our every expectation. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff were more than helpful. Best of all, the location couldn't have been better. We were closed to everything! My kids tried all the pillow selections provided by the hotel. We had plenty of towels and quick reponse to housekeeping requests. There was plenty of hot water and great water pressure. We couldn't have had a better experience for our first trip and we will definately stay at the Affinia again on return trips.

<Content>perfection with kids Stayed here for 2 nights with my teenage sons. Two queen beds and a pullout couch in a huge room with a full kitchenette. We had cereal and fruit for breakfast to save$$$ in our room. Everything was great , especially the front desk staff and doorman. Close to everything just a block from the Waldorf. at probably half the price. I usually stay at the Hilton Towers but definitely will stay here from now on.Best deal in midtown.

<Content>Super Place Had an excellant stay at the Affina 50 for my wifes 30th birthday. Got off to a great start when Sid at the check in counter was able to immeadiately wish my wife happy birthday and then found us a great room on the 18th floor with a baclony giving us a nice view of the city. I had sent a request ahead of time for a room with a view but you never really think these things are acted on. Well at the Affina 50 it was and this attention to detail was really appreciated by us. The room was suprisingly spacious given everything I had heard about the size of rooms in NYC. Everything was very clean and the bathroom was pristine. We ordered our pillows from the menu and they were there when we got back that night (together with a card and a bottle of wine for my wife). The bed was very comfortable. To be honest I cannot think of one thing that was negative against this hotel.If you are not sure, go ahead and book it as I doubt you will be dissapointed.

<Content>50 Cheers for the Affinia! We spent May 25th through May 30th at the Affinia 50 on our first trip to New York City. We were made to feel comfortable and welcome from the moment we checked in until we grudgingly left. When we called to confirm our reservation two weeks ahead, we were asked if we would prefer a lower or higher level room. We are very happy that we opted for the higher level as we were given a room on a corner of the 18th floor overlooking 3rd Avenue and 50th Street. We had beautiful view from our shared balcony of the city. We had a standard room with a huge, incredibly comfortable, king-sized bed. Our daughter and her fiance came up with us when we arrived to check in the hotel. Our future son-in-law works for a well-known hotel on Lexington and he was even amazed at the quality and amenties provided by the Affinia. As for the huge bed, after a night of dining and bar-hopping, three of us were able to take a nap comfortably on it, while hubby napped on the lounger before we all took in the Yankee game later that night. The Affinia is close to the Subway, Times Square, Rockfeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral. As a matter of fact, pretty much everything you can cram in a few days is within walking distance. Even the Gray line tour picks up and drops off 2 blocks away next to the Waldorf hotel. We highly recommend the tour for 1st timers as you can get off/on for 2 days/nights as much as you like, cramming in all the sightseeing you can stand for $48 a person. All in all we had a wonderful time in Gotham City. Everyone from the hotel staff to people in the subways were very friendly and helpful to we two small town mice scurrying around town trying to take in as much as we could.

<Content>TOP MARKS TO AFFINIA 50 I booked this hotel after reading excellent reviews on this web site.This was my 1st trip to New York. I had been told some of the Hotels were very diasappointing (unless your paying top dollar)  I was warned not to expect too much. I was absolutely delighted with this Hotel. The staff were lovely. The location was very central. The room was spacious, modern  very comfortable. We were offered cheese  wine in the very relaxing Club Room. Oh Yes  New York was wonderful.

<Content>Stay here! REALLY!! I can't say enough about this hotel. Everything was perfect! I loved the boutique atmosphere and, although the main entrance lobby is small, it is tastefully decorated. If you want more space, just go up one floor to the Club Room where you can hang out and watch a big screen TV or use the well equipped fitness room.We were allowed to check in early (around 10:00 AM) which was nice to nap and shower before a day of sightseeing. The decorations were very European modern and I LOVED the king size bed with duvet. Very luxurious!The staff was very friendly, from the front desk to the maids. Really, I just can't say enough about this hotel except that you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Great place to stay!!  My wife and I spent 7 nights (first week of June) at the Affinia 50 and were truly impressed. We had a Jr. Suite overlooking 50th on the 10th floor and all services and accomodations were more than I expected. All the previous reviews we read on this site were right on the money. Smallish kitchen but very usable for coffee and snacks. Bathroom amenities were suitable and the Aveda products were great. Bed was a nice place to end the day. This was our first trip to NYC and we are looking to go back in the near future. It is a 15 minute walk to Times Square, Central Park, and 5 minutes to the Subway which we used numerous times. This hotel is highly recommended!!!!

<Content>Can't fault it! Fantastic place to stay in New York if you don't want to pay over the top rates. Very conveniently situated in midtown and right by the main subway line which runs through the night. We were upgraded to a bigger room when we asked if any were available. Polite and friendly staff. Rooms much bigger than we imagined for New York. Would definitely come and stay here again!

<Content>Clean rooms, polite staff, perfect location! I've only just got round to writing this review - 5 months after we stayed at the Affinia 50! My girlfriend and I booked this place for a long weekend, and it was excellent. On entering the hotel, the reception looks a little dark and in need of some modernisation. The lift and corridors also looked a little dated, but the room was great, with a bed big enough to lose your partner in! It was also spotlessly clean and well maintained. The staff were so polite (rare for New Yorkers I think!) and nothing was too much trouble. As far as location was concerned, we were in walking distance of Time Square, The Rockefeller Centre, MOMA, Park Lane, 5th Avenue, etc, etc. It wasn't the Ritz, and I'm sure if we'd paid a lot more, we could have got somewhere a little more fashionable...............but to be honest, it was just right.

I'd reserved a 1 bedroom non-smoking and was upgraded on arrival to a 1+ BR, 18th floor, but not non-smoking :-( The bed was very comfortable. We requested memory foam pillows but they were not available any of our 4 nights. The standard pillows were above average. Bathroom was also great - plenty of water pressure, decent sized tub, Aveda shampoo, conditioner, lotion and mouthwash.The room was clean, modern decor, overlooking 50th Street. TINY (maybe 5x8 feet) but functional kitchen - refrigerator, range, dishwasher, microwave, toaster, coffee pot, pots, pans and silverware - and a corkscrew. Yes, you can still bring a bottle of wine or 2 on a plane. There's a real grocery store 2 blocks away, 51st St. and 2nd Ave. We cooked breakfast 3 days but I doubt we really saved any money. There are 2 restaurants on 50th that serve breakfast for under $15 per person. We didn't do the Affinia continental breakfast based on Trip Advisor comments.Also on the same block - The Benjamin (50th and Lexington, Affinia's NYC flagship), The Kimberly (middle of 50th), The San Carlos (across the street from Kimberly). There's a Doubletree around the corner on Lexington, and the Waldorf-Astoria is on 49th, if money is no object. Expedia's map shows the hotel in the middle of the block, but it's not - it's on the corner of 50th and 3rd. We thought the Affinia 50 was a great value.The #6 subway station is at 51st and Lexington, and we rode every day. Great way to get north and south in Manhattan. Broadway (Times Square) is a 20 minute walk, or you can hop-hop-hop on trains or buses. We had excellent weather so we walked all over, probably 15 miles, including around the reservoir in Central Park. Dining in NYC - thousands of choices... the Blue Fin (W hotel in Times Square) was great, others were ok. Little Italy looked fun, lots of outdoor tables, but we'd just eaten in Chinatown.If you go and your cabbie doesn't know the hotel, have him go to 50th and Lexington, then left (East) on 50th. Better yet, take a limo - but get a coupon on the internet first. It should cost $25 plus toll ($5 for the tunnel), plus tip.We'll be back. I love Trip Advisor - thanks to all the other reviewers!

<Content>Fantastic- a home from home My partner and I stayed at the Affinia 50 between May 28 and June 1, 2005. We had originally booked to stay at the Waldorf but got a good rate for the Affinia 50 and thought we would save some money by changing our reservation. I was extremely glad we had too! Ok the lobby is small, but it looks good and every person who served us was genuinely friendly and helpful- from the cup of welcome punch- a welcome relief from the hot sun in New York, to the small fridge in our room- which was empty and great for cans of drink etc- and not at exorbitant minibar prices- well I give this 5 stars- if you can get a good rate. We were in a small queen bed room which although not a suite- was strill huge and well equipped from aveda toiletries, fab cable tv with many channels, coffee making service with wolfgang puck coffee and the lovely second floor lounge where we were happy to sit whilst waiting for our car to theairport once we had checked out. The Affinia 50 is almost on the same block as the Waldorf and extremely handy for the 51st street subway station which stops at almost every place of interest- from Grand Central, union Square, Chinatown, City Hall etc- so convenient and cheap as well. Round the corner from the Affinia is the 17th precinct police station and a fire station- so there is a generally safe feel to the place too. There are plenty of places to eat nearby including a nice coffeeshop, steak houses, mcdonalds, korean grocers with plenty of goodies on offer and you can get to many other places by foot. I cannot wait to go back and would recommend this place- i have stayed at many NY hotels over the years- Hilton New yrok, Hilton Millennium, Swissotel, Embassy Suites, Waldorf Astoria, habitat- but these folks were the genuine real deal- try it- you wont regret it!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Wonderful Town Unbeknownst the management, the Affinia 50 has ensured my future happiness as a traveler married to an ex-New Yorker.My husband left his native city 30 years ago, vowing never to return to the riots, crime, garbage strikes and other mayhem typical of Manhattan in the '70s. I, on the other hand, had visited the city on my own six years ago and was absolutely smitten with it. Years of repetitive marital suggestions on my part finally wore down my better half's resistance, and he grudgingly agreed to return briefly to the Big Apple with me. I immediatly launched into a frenzy of Internet searching for just the right hotel to make good on my promise that a trip to New York would in no way resemble a holiday in Hades. Late into the night, I pored over TripAdvisor reviews in a growing state of alarm: The most expensive hotels gauranteed a plush experience but were far beyond our budget. Some of the cheapest places sounded positively Dickensian, with levels of filth and discomfort that a midieval peasant would have found unacceptable. Reviews of the Affinia 50 sounded too good to be true: In the heart of Midtown where I wanted to stay, lovely rooms and courteous staff, at a reasonable price. I crossed my fingers and booked.A few weeks later, as our cab crawled through traffic from JFK toward Manhattan, the sight of the Chrysler Building glittering on the horizon wasn't quite enough to keep me from silently planning how we could escape if the Affinia 50 turned out not be as advertised. Could we find another hotel? Stay in New Jersey? Fly home early? Would I ever see my beloved Manhattan again?Well, I needn't have worried. From the stylish exterior (my husband is an architect an we are both fans of modern design, so we liked the stainless-steel awning and towering indoor waterfall in the lobby) to the smiles on the faces of the fedora-clad doormen, we were delighted from the moment we stepped over the threshold. Not only did the hotel have our reservation (another fear of mine), they upgraded us at no charge from a standard room to a junior suite. As we rode up in the elevator, I reminded my husband that rooms on New York are small. In this respect, the Affinia did make a liar of me: our room was immense, with a sitting area, a full small kitchen, a good-sized bathroom, huge closets, and sweeping picture windows across the entire south wall. As we gazed down across a plaza to the famous Smith and Wollensky steakhouse, my husband grinned from ear to ear and said, This is great!Although the building is older, everything in our room was new, appearing to be no more than a couple of years old. Our bed had crisp luxury linens and the most comfortable mattress I have ever had the privilege of sleeping on. The bathroom had ultramodern fixtures (not in the scary, what-is-this-button-for mode, but understated elegance) with Aveda bath products and huge pillowy towels. The office area had a high-speed data connection that we did not use, but we did use the living room with overstuffed chairs, large-screen TV and sofa. We also liked the CD player, popping in discs that we bought on our shopping expeditions through Manhattan's music stores. The Affinia does not have a restaurant, but we did not care as we usually try to eat in as many different places as possible when we travel. There is an absolutely amazing deli called Azure around the corner from the hotel. Several nights, when we had worn our feet down to little stubs walking through museums and galleries, we were content to curl up on our comfy sofa with heaping portions of pad thai and a couple of cold beers from the deli and just watch TV. The hotel also offers continental breakfast for an additional $10 per night, but the deli was so convenient and such good value that we just went there instead. Every morning I got up, got dressed, went out past the cheerful doormen who would tip their fedoras to me, elbowed my way into the streaming throngs of non-tourist New Yorkers, and made for Azure to pick up coffee and pain au chocolate. I would then return to the room, where we sat in the fabulous bed marveling at our good fortune. The only drawback to this routine was that it cut in to sightseeing time, as we got so comfortable we could hardly pry ourselves out of our room. Each morning we would vow to get going before 10:00, but it rarely happened.Late in our stay we discovered that the hotel has wine and cheese available for guests every evening. Again, we did not take advantage of this amenity as we were usually still out sightseeing due to the above-mentioned late start.During our stay, there was only one annoyance, which was not the hotel's fault. The building across the street was being renovated, and some of the work was being done late at night, resulting in pounding and large diesel-engine-idling noises, rather like those of a garbage truck. I think this sort of thing is nearly unvoidable in Manhattan, so I would encourage anyone who does not travel with earplugs to do so. We heard no other street noises from our sixth-floor room nor did we hear any sound from any other rooms.The Affinia's location is one of its major advantages. If you're reasonably energetic, you can easily walk to Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center, the south end of Central Park, and Grand Central Station. There are also several subway entrances near the hotel. There are too many restaurants in the neighborhood to list, but fans of Irish pubs as my husband and I are will find the number of these establishments within a few blocks to be nothing short of overwhelming. We also had an outstanding and thoroughly real New York experience dining at Smith and Wollensky, made all the more pleasant by being able to walk across the street to the restaurant.The Affinia's neighborhood is quite safe, and I would have had no concern whatsover about walking around alone at night.My only complaint about the hotel was that we were unable to extend our stay, as they were thoroughly booked. The staff made immense efforts to accommodate our request, but there was never a cancellation. After four days at the Affinia, I certainly can understand why. Nevertheless, I'm overjoyed as the person who was trying the hardest to get the additional time was my husband. We'll be back!

<Content>Great location, clean and friendly This was our first trip to New York. It was my daughter's 21st birthday and this was a special trip for her. We arrived late the first night and were put into a room with one bed which was a disappointment as I had called that morning to confirm that they had 2 beds for us. They made up for it the next 2 nights by giving us a junior suite (kitchenette and 2 queen beds) at no extra charge. The rooms were spacious, modern and tastefully decorated. The Aveda products were a bonus. All the staff at the front desk got to know us by our names and went out of their way with recommendations for restaurants/clubs and with directions. It was a pleasant atmosphere to come and go to. The second floor had a cozy sitting area with books and games and wide screen T.V. This came in handy when our flight was later than our checkout time and we needed a place where we could relax. They also serve continental breakfast here every morning. The location was within comfortable walking distance to major shopping, Central Park, the theatre district, Rockefeller center. The restaurant right next door had delicious seafood and steak dinners and a great atmosphere. Our only complaint was that the cleaning staff were overly zealous to get our rooms cleaned in the mornings. We had traveled east so had not yet adjusted to the 3 hour time change. We were repeatedly woken up and couldn't find a 'do not disturb' sign anywhere in the room to hang on the door. What we really liked about the Affinia was that it felt like a small hotel with personalized service in a big city. We look forward to revisiting New York in the future and will defintely stay at the Affinia again.

<Content>What a wonderul find! I have stayed at The Plaza, The St. Regis and The Waldorf. They were all dumps compared to The Affina 50.Our entire stay was a delight. From the unbelievably accommodating staff....to the well equipped kitchen (complete with fridge, stove and microwave)...and the thoughtfully stocked bathroom (terry robes and Aveda products)...to the luxurious beds (with 3 choices of pillows)...the comfy couch and easy chair and the easy-to-read-by lighting. Even the CD left by the Sony Dream Machine was perfect.This particular Affina hotel is centrally located at 50th between Lexington and 3rd. There are 6 other Affina hotels spread out from the 30's to the 70's, so you're likely to find one in just the right location -- whether you're in NY for business, theatre, shopping, restaurant hopping or visiting friends. Whichever one you choose, I'm sure your Affina hotel experience will enhance your stay. After 30 years of dreading going into the City, I'm now actually looking forward to my next trip to New York!

<Content>Loved New York, Loved Affinia 50 Hotel Just returned from a great 5 day stay in New York and the hotel affinia 50 really lived up to expectations. The rooms were modern and well looked after and the service from all the staff was first class, the hotel is also well placed in midtown for all the main sightseeing destinations. When i return to New York in the future i will have no hesitation in booking the Affinia 50 again.

<Content>great hotel and wonderful staff I have visited this hotel many times over the last 5 years. It has always been a hidden jewel. I think the staff are wonderful and always very helpful. I have recommendedd it to other people who have come back raving about the Affinia. Plus I love the club room that is available to all guests to relax and meet friends over a glass of wine.

<Content>Absolutely fantastic! I booked a trip to New York as a surprise for my partner's 40th birthday, and my only concern was if the hotel matched up to the reviews I had read. I need not have worried, as everything was utterly perfect, from the polite and friendly staff who checked us in, to the fab doormen who helped us leave. The room was huge, and the bed was amazing. My boyfriend is very picky when it comes to pillows, and even he was completely satisfied with the choice! Everything was so clean, the Aveda products were yummy, and the kitchen a bonus. Every member of staff had a smile on their face and a friendly word - their professional service and friendly manner really added to our holiday. Our first trip to NYC was so memorable for all the right reasons, and I would not hesitate to recommend the Affinia 50 to anyone considering a visit.

<Content>Best Hotel in NYC for Quality, Comfort and Price On arrival at The Affinia 50 my partner and i got a wonderful welcome from the concierge, Welcome home, he said as he lifted our bags and helped us through the doors.The check in was quick. The lobby, small but well presented. We stayed on the 9th floor and what a wonderful junior suite room we had. It was perfect for our week stay and was sometimes hard to leave due to the wonderful decor and comfort. No view though as we were almost up against a wall but this left the room extremely quiet. The kitchen was the only let down as it wasn't done to the standard of the rest of the room but we didn't use it much so it didn't matter.We were rushing around sightseeing all day and were extremely tired and couldn't wait to rest our weary feet but i do have to say the bed was the most comfortable i have ever slept in in my life. We were asleep as soon as our heads touched the pillow (although i didn't use the pillow as it was a little on the large side). The water in my bath wasn't the hottest and neither was the temperature of the room but i'm sure if we'd have contacted the front desk they'd have had it sorted in no time.The concierge were great, always there to open doors and welcome you home. Ralph deserves a special mention for organising our helicopter flight, which was magnificent and definately advised for spectacular views of the city. Each day we would return to a well cleaned room. The maids were spotless. The 2nd floor lounge is well worth a look if you want somewhere to chill out for a bit too.A little way out on the east side from Times Square but not far from Rockerfeller and Chrysler building. Subway is just around the corner and taxis are along every few seconds.All in all the Affinia 50 has been my favourite hotel to date. Well recommended. Just go there and see. Cheers.

<Content>Affinia is Nice Enough Firstly I loved the room! Roomy nice comfortable bed, very clean nice bath products, good mirrors. Not the suite just the standard room Very nice! Pretty bathroom all very comfortable. The deli around the corner is fantastic! I forget what it's called but begins with an A. Room service don't bother I paid 28$ for a lobster salad was just awful. The gym was nice and the 2nd floor they had free wine and cheese and coffee. The was something wrong with the phone but maintenance came up almost immediately and fixed the problem. The view sucked and was above some fans but it didn't really bother me. Overall Very good and would definitely go back.

<Content>Vastly overrated on Tripadvisor When I was deciding on a hotel for this trip to NYC, I picked the Affinia 50 because of its superb tripadvisor.com reviews. Now, having stayed there for 2 nights I wonder if those rave reviews were actually written by a PR firm or Affinia employees. Seriously! This hotel is adequate but nothing even close to great. It was in the low 80s Farenheit while I was in New York and I prefer to sleep in cool temperatures. I called downstairs to see what could be done, as the thermastat (sp?) was as low as it could go and the room was still too warm for my tastes. I was told open your windows. Um. This is hardly a solution when the street noise is so loud that it awakens you in the mornings even with your windows shut.The lobby was tiny, but that didn't bother me in the least since as far as I can tell, lobbies are a waste of money/space. And the aveda products in my teeny bathroom were lovely. The staff was friendly. But overall the hotel was utterly unimpressive and I will not stay there again unless I get a much better price.

<Content>Affinia a disappointment I picked the Affinia 50 because of its positive TripAdvisor reviews, but the hotel was a disappointment. I asked for a quiet room, but was given a room on a low floor, between the stairs and the elevator, and directly above the exhaust fans for a nearby business; I expected to have to pay for Internet access, and while they did provide a network cable, there was no place to plug it in--the room had never been wired for Internet; I expected a kitchenette and got just a coffeemaker; heck, I expected functioning air conditioning, but that was broken too! On a day when the outside temperature peaked at 60 degrees, the room was 80 degrees all night long. (And forget opening the windows for ventilation; the noise from the nearby fans was enough to prevent conversation with the windows open.) On the positive side, the room was spacious for New York, the bed was comfortable (down duvet, synthetic pillows), and everything was clean. I'm never staying here again.

<Content>Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful Just returned yesterday from a girls' weekend in NYC. We stayed at the Affinia 50 from a recommendation of my husband who has stayed here on business. We can't stop raving about every aspect of the hotel. Check-in was quick and easy. Our room was absolutely perfect. All the reviews about the beds are so true. It was more comfortable than my bed at home. We never heard a sound from neighboring rooms and knew they were occupied. The bath products are fabulous -- how can you go wrong with Aveda. The staff always had a ready smile on their face and were extremely helpful with our questions. Can't wait to come back!

<Content>Affinia 50 for you'all!! We stayed in Affinia 50 for a whole week. At first I was a little bit concerned, since I've been visiting New York 30 years ago and any dirt-hole in NY might ask for US$200.00 a night, so price is not a good filter. When we arrived to Affinia 50 the staff was very helpful and very professional, the room was very good, a little sober, but for the price I wasn't dissapointed at all. This hotel is one of the smartest choices. The location is a little bit back east, but not that bad, within 8 minutes you are in Rockefeller Center. Please don't misunderstand, this is not a luxury hotel, it's an affordable, clean, well located and well staffed hotel for so to speak.If you are visiting New York on a tight budget this is your choice, don't look further. I've seen hotels asking for the same and there is not comparison, this is the place.If you are looking 5 stars and a fancy hotel I would recommend The Benjamin or The Peninsula, and guess what... The Benjamin is an Affinia hotel and is barely 50 meters from Affinia 50, so if you are staying for 5 nights and stay in Affinia 50 Instead, you might save enough to buy a nice sport jacket at Brook Brothers or a Dinner for 6 at Gramercy Tavern, so you do your math. :)

<Content>Affinia Exceeds expectations The Affinia 50 lives up to and even exceeds expectations! This is a wonderful hotel whose outstanding feature is the personnel and service along with the accomodations. We stayed in a very comfortable queen double on the 14th floor. The beds were so comfortable that we had to tear ourselves away. Midtown location is very convenient to theatre district and Rockefeller Center. Every request or question was met with a friendly and efficient answer and our greeting and check-in could not have been handled better. I felt that the staff went out of their way to make our stay the best it could be and it was! The second floor club room was very roomy and offered a comfortable place to hang out and work or just relax. I would definitely stay here again except I would request a room in the back of the hotel as it remained quite noisy throughout the night.

<Content>1st Big Apple visit enhanced greatly by Affinia 50 Based on my due diligence in searching for a quality location/hotel, I figured the Affinia 50 had something special going for it because the reviews were clearly leaning towards the positive side. I can now confirm for the rest of you first hand that the glowing reviews are for good reason. Although this hotel is noted in several publication as an executive class hotel, I booked my family of 3 (my wife, a 17 mo old daughter and myself) for a family vacation. The website photos for the Affinia 50 do not do it justice. The corner location is brilliant. The hotel lobby, albeit smaller in comparison to other hotels, appears brand spanking new and makes up for lack of quatitive lobby space with superior small space aesthetics.The one bedroom suite I booked online thru Travelocity (via Tripadvisor.com of course) with specific requests for a non-smoking room with a view and a high chair for the baby were all flawlessly met upon check-in. The full amenity kitchen was used alot. The added value of the kitchen paid for itself by allowing me to make sit down breakfasts for us every day of our stay from 4/24-4/27/05. The 15th floor room (#1505) turned out to be a corner room suite overlooking E. 50th St and 3rd Ave.. Talk about a view! My wifes brother and his young family met us at our hotel room so as to join us for dinner in the area and with his two kids and my kid all running around the room, everyone still had plenty of space to move around freely. I was advised by my brother in law (who is familiar w/ Manhattan) that the room, had it been an apt for rent, would easily fetch $5k per month and that the size of the room was easily 2-3 times larger than most NYC hotel rooms. Needless to say, he was impressed by my hotel find for someone that had never been to NY, much less Manhattan.The location of the hotel was of course great. Subway entrances are located nearby (1 to 1 1/2 blocks away). There are every possible assortment of convenient stores available to you for food and drink all within the square block of the hotel. That aspect alone is worth the stay when traveling with a young child. Got milk? Sure do, right down stairs and around the corner (24/7).  All of the tourist attractions people from all over the world come to NYC to see are all within striking distance of this hotel, be it by an inexpensive taxi, subway, bus ride or even a nice walk. We walked to Times Square 3 different times from the hotel and we didn't even have to breathe hard doing it (even while pushing the kid in a stroller). The #6 subway (a block from the hotel) will take you down to great ethnic areas like Little Italy and China Town in about 15-20 minutes. The food to be found in just those two areas alone are to die for and we all know how NYC is regarded for its food options. Just imagine all the great palate pleasing possibilities available to you. I could go on and on but I think you now know where I am coming from in regards to this hotel. And of course a hotel of this quality is only as good as THEIR STAFF and they DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The staff was friendly, attentive and spot on with all their advice/recommendations pertaining to the city in which they do business. Oh, and the rooms, spotless. Housekeeping was outstanding with the daily refresh.If you reserve a room at the Affinia 50, you will find out just as we did that NYC has more to offer than world renowned attractions, it also has hotels that price themselves right and are staffed by friendly folks that make your stay more than a vacation, they give you a feeling of being home away from home.Cheers to the Affinia 50!FYI, Cheers! is the slogan the staff uses throughout the hotel to meet and greet its residents.

<Content>Just right Good location (walking distance to Bloomingdale's, Madison, Park, 5th etc.). Affable, likeable staff. Our room was small (c'mon, it's New York), but very tastefully furnished/decorated. We didn't make use of any breakfasts or other amenities so I can't comment on those. Don't expect luxurious space and panoramic views here, but if you are looking to spend your day in town and not lounge about in a luxury hotel, this is a very tasteful, comfortable and conveniently located hotel. There is a nightclub next door so that might be a problem for some, but we couldn't hear anything from our particular room.

<Content>Loved this place We want to thank you for your outstanding service, and for going the extra mile for our delightful stay in your hotel last weekend. Check-in was a little bumpy, but you definitely made up for it with all the perks, and we really appreciate it! We have been to NYC many, many times, but know that if we stayed at the Marriott or Hilton, we would not have received the same attention. The entire staff...Arlene, Rome, the room attendant, the bellman, and the other morning doorman (we don't know his name) were all the best! We have filled out the survey e-mailed to us and you guys got an A plus! Thanks again for everything, and we will be back!!!

<Content>Good value, great bed, terrific staff We booked the Affinia 50 as a result of all the glowing reviews on this website. We were not disappointed, though I have one quibble: multiple reviewers mentioned being upgraded at check-in. Though I had said in advance it was our wedding anniversary, which I repeated when we arrived, no upgrade for us. (I later learned the hotel was sold-out.) The hotel did send up a complimentary bottle of wine, however. Nice touch. My husband ordered flowers for me through the hotel, specifying what type of flowers he wanted included in the arrangement, and they were gorgeous. (They used a local florist.) The room was extremely comfortable, fantastic bed, great fixtures in the small bathroom (very good water pressure), wonderfully nice staff. The full-length mirror takes at least 10 pounds off, BTW - a good ego boost going out the door! Loved the cocktail hour (free) in the Eurofab stylish 2nd floor lounge. We didn't try the $10 per person continental breakfast - wonder why it ends so early (930 during the week, 1030 on the weekends)? Food smells pervaded the room when we opened our window, but we were on the 3rd floor - maybe this isn't an issue on higher floors. I'd definitely go back, but only if the price stayed at $200 or less per night.

<Content>excellent, could not fault this hotel at all I have just come back from New York and must say that all the reviews this hotel has had are true. The Affina 50 is in an excellent position and the quality is second to non, I cant believe it has a 3 star rating should be a 4 star property, the room I had on the 17th floor had excellent views and a lovely balcony, rooms are clean and large. I would definitly go back to this hotel with out a doubt!!!!!!

<Content>A Home From Home As a travel agent for Ebookers in the uk we spent 2 nights at this hotel from the 8th april 2005. The hotel staff were very efficient, the hotel was clean and tidy, the rooms are a fantastic size for New York as they are all suites. This hotel is a must if you come for sometime in the Big Apple as you will not feel cramped and you will get the good service as the hotel is small in comparison to others.I would definitely stay again or I would use another of the Affinia group, maybe the Beekman Tower ....But all in all GREAT !

<Content>Good location, nice people, great room  My wife and I stayed at the Affinia 50 for our wedding anniversary weekend. Our room was large (by NYC standards), comfortable and quiet. We both thought that the bed was one of the more comfortable hotel beds we have ever experienced. The room was clean and remarkably quiet, the bathroom adequate (smallish, but it is NYC), the appointments in good shape. The staff was both very friendly and very helpful. The location was terrific. The cock-tail hour in the lounge was very pleasant. One small complaint, we stayed in the first week of April. The day we arrived had been a hot one but the building鈥檚 air conditioner was not yet operative (not too unusual in an older building in NYC, but annoying nonetheless). Our first night (of three) was very warm and it being NYC, you really can鈥檛 leave the windows open or the street noise will be too much. However, after the temperature returned to a more normal zone the next day, the room was perfectly comfortable. In short, be careful during transitional months. Also, while our room was very clean, etc. the hall smelled of cigarettes. We got a great price and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel, great service I was impressed by all aspects of the Affinia 50. Sophistication without the attitude, which is so hard to find. When I was concerned about how to find a particular restaurant by cab, the person at the front desk found the restaurant in the NYC Zagat guide and made a copy of the listing for me. The service from the bell staff was equally terrific.I can't wait to return!

<Content>Not lakely to saty here again... My husband and I stayed here in February 2005 for one night and had a fairly unpleasant experience. We got a great deal from americanexpress and the reviews in tripadvisor seemed good. We had a standard room, not a suite. It was very tiny with hardly any where to put our bags, except an easy chair and a desk. The room was newly furnished with modern furniture, but was very dim. There was a stong smell of french fries in the room the whole time we where there, presumable form a neighboring restaurant. Our room over looked a brick wall and a roof with chimney  ducts, etc. The shower drain was broken and water backed up to our ankles. If we had be staying longer we would have certainly changed rooms, if not hotels. Valet parking is $35 and it took 1.5 hrs to get my car, even tough we called a half an hour ahead of when we needed it, like we were told to do. The club room is pretty nice, but continental breakfast is $10 pp.The staff were nice, however, especially the hard working bellhops. The lobby is tiny and got quite crowded at check in/ out time.

<Content>Great Hotel, but..... I loved this hotel. It was in a great location, the room was really nice and the staff was very pleasant. The only thing that I didnt like was that the walls were really thin. I could hear people talking in the rooms around mine and you could hear the bass from the club downstairs. Other than that it was great. I would stay here again.

<Content>the other reviewers were right. Just stayed here one night over Easter weekend. I thought rate of $169 through hotel was good for a newly renovated hotel in a good location. I would consider this a business persons hotel, with the internet connection and lots of outlets. The style is modern. But very comfortable for my husband and I, in for the weekend. Average size room, nicely furnished, king bed, down comforter with a pillow menu available. Closet space good. No restaurant or bar in hotel, plenty nearby, but a club floor with lounge and for $10 p.p. there is an expanded continental breakfast available (juice, fresh fruit, cereals, bagels, pastries, coffee, tea). Walked to the theatre, 2 subways nearby for other parts of town. This is not a 5 star luxury hotel nor a too cool for school trendy hotel, but a very pleasant hotel with nice staff.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location I have just returned from spending Easter weekend in NYC and the Affinia 50 is the best value hotel I have stayed at in the city. It has a great location and the staff very extremely helpful. The rooms have been recently renovated and we booked a jnr suite which by NYC hotel room standards was massive. There is an excellent club lounge where guests can relax and unwind with a cuppa after a long days shopping and the staff are very happy to help with any arrangements. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone travelling to NYC.

<Content>What a Gem This hotel is a gem of a find in a city that has a lot to offer. We booked for one night only and I was sad that we couldn't stay longer but I hope to stay there again on my next trip down. The hotel itself is very non descript from the outside but once you step inside, what a find it is. The young doorman is a character but has some great recommendations for local restaurants delis etc and always had such a genuine smile and warmth for all the guests. The design style in the rooms is very warm and comfortable and the bed was first class, I hated getting up in the morning. The bathrooms are beautiful and the bath products (Aveda) top class. I could not find one fault with the room, it is just like the photos show. The chill out area on the second floor is a wonderful space to relax after a tough day to read a book with a nice drink to accompany it. Diana (or Dyana) at the front desk is wonderful and immediately located an Aveda store locally where I was able to purchase some of the same bath products they have in the guestrooms. Nothing was to much trouble for the staff here, they were all just superb. This hotel serves as a model of customer service, comfort and excellent value for money. I have found my new home in NYC when I visit.

<Content>Enjoyable stay Hi,This was my first visit to NY, and I decided to book this hotel based on the positive reviews given in Tripadvisor, and I was not disappointed. The room was spacious, comfortable and clean and the hotel staff were very friendly. I found that a lot of the main tourist attractions were in walking distance, and that it was convenient to have a luncheonette, a deli and a book store close by.

<Content>Mixed! I can understand why so many reviews are positive -- this hotel is in a good location, the staff are super-friendly and very on the ball, and the bed is wonderfully comfortable. But I found a number of things off. * We were supposedly in a non-smoking room, but the room stunk, and the staff member who brought up an ozone machine forgot to turn it on, so it accomplished nothing while we were out the day we first requested it.* The puce blinds had water stains on them and vehemently clashed with the red and beige arm chair. In a budget hotel, this wouldn't bother me, but in a hotel that styles itself as luxurious, the stains were unacceptable and the style choices startlingly bad.* The bathtub drain was broken.* The noise from the hallway is unbelievable. Don't think about sleeping in. The doors are weighted so heavily that you'll be woken up by one door after another slamming as other guests leave their rooms. You will also have to listen to the housekeeping staff knocking on other doors and yelling out at other guests before they get to your room.* The desk is huge, so you feel as if you are sleeping in an office. If you're in New York on business, you might very well appreciate the size of the desk. But if you're there for romance, you'll feel stuck in the work-a-day world!In conclusion, while this is a decent hotel, it is over-priced. You could certainly do worse, but you could also certainly do better. If you do book this hotel, make sure you get a rate that is at least half of the rack rate (as we did) or else you're likely to feel that you have misspent your money.

<Content>Warm your gloves... Stayed March18 to 21, 2005. Read the other reviews, they are almost dead on. Location great, staff excellent, good value, clean, and so on. Well, almost and so on. I have a couple of quibles, and that is really all they are. Firstly, on the Affiinia Website this hotel is rated in their 'Signature' series, implying the top range. In fact, the Benjamin, which is virtually next door, looked like a more appealing hotel, although, having not stayed there I base this observation solely on a comparison of the lobbies of the two facilities. The Affinia's is decidedly cramped. Secondly, a major oversight in the renovation of the rooms was the kitchen...at least in our junior suite. It is the size of a broom closet, and features rather tired looking cupboards, counters, appliances AND the tiniest microwave oven I've ever encountered. Like the size of a glovebox. In fact, it might have been a glovebox. If you review the photo gallery on their website you will notice photos of the kitchen are conspicous in their absence. OK, enough kretching, I actually enjoyed the place, the staff seem to really make an effort. The doormen, especially, with their signature fedoras, add a stylish touch. Plus, the beds were the 'bomb', as my teenage daughter would say. (This is a compliment) I would stay again.

<Content>Clean, Convenient, Good Value I stayed at the Affinia for 2 nights in February. The location is very good. Close to the subway, and just a couple of blocks from Saint Patrick's Cathedral. The hotel was very recently renovated; thus, it is fresh and clean. The gym is modest. I got a fantastic special through Quikbook ($179.00 including breakfast for a junior suite), but I was traveling in low season. The room was cavernous by New York standards; perfect for families (I wish mine had been traveling with me). The breakfast is simple (fruit, pastries), but perfectly adequate. If you do not have it included, the charge is $10.00 extra-I would not pay anymore than that. The wine and cheese in the evenings is again very simple (no plates for the cheese, you had to use napkins, a disappointment), but a nice touch before heading out to dinner. I was disappointed that the room adjoining the lounge was used for private events on both my nights there; it made the lounge a little crowded. My room had no view, but was very quiet. The doorman was very friendly. The renovations are very nice, but not overly luxurious (tile instead of marble in the bathrooms). All in all, I have paid substantially more in New York for smaller, less well-kept accomodations. I would go back.

<Content>Perfect Small hotel Stayed at the Affinia 50 from 3/9-3/15/2005. Location is on the upper East Side. Room was spotless. Enjoyed the choice of pillows. Staff was always friendly and helpful. Breakfast available in the 2nd floor Club Room for $10.00, or go up the street for a typical NY coffee shop breakfast.24 Hour drugstore and upscale food market around the corner.

<Content>Affinia 50- great deal, great location If you're looking for a great location and a good deal (my experience), then look into the Affinia 50 at 50th and Third Ave. A block from the Waldorf (where our conference was sited), and less than half the price. New rooms, cool furnishings, great amenities and loads of space. Easily twice the space in a guest room than the Waldorf. By using Expedia (can I say that?) I got two nights at $179 per. $10 for the buffet bkfst (save yer dough, there's plenty of bkfst joints w/in two blocks). NO RESTAURANT on premises, but it's NYC fer cryin' out loud. For business travellers there is Smith  Wollensky a block away, for the more budget minded there's pasta places, burger joints, pubs, and Indian restaurants within a 5 min walk. Staff is amazing. Super well trained, professional and courteous.

<Content>Fabulous Stay We were very pleasantly surprised by this hotel.The rooms were huge by NYC standards, the bed was incredibly comfortable, made more so by the selection of pillows. The room was spotless, nicely decorated.The location suited us fine as we don't mind a bit of walk. Walked with no problem to theatres on Broadway on two occasions.Staff were very friendly and accomodating, we were always greeted when entering or leaving the hotel.Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Absolutely fabulous We stayed at the Affinia 50 for six nights, and what a great experience!! We were only able to find a cheap rate on Expedia for three of the nights we were staying, so we figured we would change hotels after the third night. Well, we were so in love with this hotel, we ended up cancelling our other reservations and staying at the Affinia for the whole time. The bed was HUGE, the decor wonderful, and the staff absolutely incredible--friendly, helpful, and accommodating at every turn. Every single staff member was friendly--this is truly the way every business should be run. When our flight got cancelled because of snow, the manager was totally wonderful. I doubt that when in NYC again that we'll ever stay anywhere else! It's worth EVERY PENNY we spent!

All of the staff was polite and some remembered us and addressed us by name (which says a lot in such a busy city). They were informative and attentive to our needs. The wine and cheese hour M-Thurs was a great added bonus!Very affordable for such a prime location and nice rooms! Would definitely stay again!

<Content>Nice NYC Niche I just returned from a three day weekend stay with my teenage daughter and her friend. We were very happy with our room, which was clean and comfortable. The beds are heavenly. We thought the pillow menu and available city guide kits were a great touch and we even enjoyed a cup of tea and a game of NYC Monopoly by the fire one night in the lounge. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the location is an easy one to explore the city from. One of the best bagel shops in the city is right across the street and there is a wonderful pasta cafe around the corner. The girls went clothes shopping at a store I could see from our window, too. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Home from home............less hassle. We stayed at the Affinia 50 for 7 nights (13/2 to 20/2) and we have absolutly no complaints about the hotel.Arrived late on the Sunday but reservation was handled with ease and when we arrived in the room. Well..............Two beds which supply excellent nights sleep. Tried to pack one in a suitcase to bring home. I have no idea what they do but they are very comfortable.Bathroom and kitchen had just what we needed so really cannot complain.The staff were always plesant and helpful and always tried to accomadae any requests.The club room was a nice facility especially the coffee and tea during the day after sightseeing.Location wise it's slightly away from the action but close enough to get involved.If you want a good base with space and places to eat close by then this should be your first choice.

<Content>Close Call Just got back from a mini vacation at the Affinia 50. Was very inpressed with the size of the room considering it's a Manhattan hotel and the full kitchen! The room was great until we had no heat and the initial hesitation on the part of the manager to not be very helpful except to offer a portable heater. Upon visiting the room itself and seeing my children shivering under the blankets she did offer me the night complimentary and moved us the next day as soon as a room became available. We also had difficulty renting movies as they were all sold out, a phenomenon I had never experienced in a hotel . Still I would return to this hotel and highly recommend it for it's low rates and great room and location in NYC

<Content>Excellent stay! We booked a junior suite, complete with a kitchenette, it was more than I imagined, and for a rate of $159.00, got much more than what we paid for. We were on the 8th floor, the rooms were spotless, and nicely decorated with plenty of closet space! The bed was super comfy, with down pillows, a down comforter and featherbed type mattress....There was plenty of room to move around, this is wonderful (especially for NYC....). The rooms were recently renovated with a modern (but comfortable) edge to it....loved the decor! Bath amenities were by Aveda (which is wonderful quality salon products). I will also say the employees were very friendly and accomodating also. Great staff!!! It has a small lobby, but who needs a huge lobby?? It serves it's purpose....we were taken care of and all checked in within 5-10 minutes!

<Content>Affinia 50 Hotel: Great Experience We selected the Affinia 50 based upon the feedback from the Trip Advisor website and the hotel lived up to all the great reviews. We arrived early in the day and the room was available and even upgraded. The hotel staff was professional, courteous and very well informed about the services and area attractions. The room was large with a full kitchen. The bed was grand and the pillow service a nice touch. Rooms were very clean and remained that way throughout our entire 5 day stay. Rates are very reasonable, especially considering the mid-town location. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>One of the best stays in New York City ever The Affinia 50 Hotel has everything going for it. For the same price as a room at the Hilton or Sheraton, you can have a clean, large one-bedroom suite. They are basically apartments with a full kitchen, large bedroom and the great Affinia bed.   One thing many people don't think about (or maybe don't care about) is the number of electric outlets in a hotel room. Well, Affinia 50 has this covered - I had no problem finding a place to plug in 2 cell phones, my Mom's Palm Pilot and my T-Mobile Sidekick device.  I think one of the best things about the Affinia 50 is the incredibly friendly, courteous and professional staff. Even though I was only there for 2 days, I felt as though I had acquired extended family members!   I would highly recommend this hotel and cannot wait to stay there again.

<Content>ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! My first stay was Nov. 20, 2004. I booked a one bedroom suite. Quite to my surprise the rooms were HUGE. The rooms had a sleek modern decor  were very clean. Great kitchen w/ stove, microwave  a full size refrigerator. It also came with utensil  pans. Room service was quick and well priced. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable. It was like a home away from home. I was extremely pleased. The only problem I encountered was a issue with the hot water  one of the elevators the next morning. despite the water issue..I THOUGHT IT JUST COULDN'T BE BETTER THIS! Shortly after my stay, I receive a letter from Affinia 50 apologizing for the unexpected inconveniences . They offered me a complimentary upgrade for my next stay at the hotel. I took them up on their offer for a stay on January 5, 2005. I called and spoke to the manager Silvio about the letter I received. He booked a one bedroom suite for me at the price of a studio suite, which was $179.00 (WOW)!He assured me he would take care of me  I would be very pleased. I could not BELIEVE the room when I arrived. LET'S JUST SAY , IT GOT MUCH BETTER!!! It was a immaculate HUGE deluxe one bedroom suite with THREE BALCONIES, a king size bed, a spacious fully stocked kitchen  a complimentary bottle of wine along w/ a welcome card personally addressed to me! VERY LUXE!! Silvio is WONDERFUL!!!!...the AFFINIA 50 IS THE WONDERFUL!!!! I highly reccommend this hotel to anyone. The staff is great. The rooms are EXTREMELY SPACIOUS, CLEAN  AFFORDABLE.... SUPERB!!!!

<Content>Superb Service without the Luxury Prices As former guest of sister hotel The Benjamin this new rebranded Affinia Fifty formely Plaza Fifty is probably the best deal in town. From personal service, extra friendly staff and generous size rooms compared to The Benjamin - Affinia Fifty has my vote for preferred hotel in NYC. The staff alone needs to be commended for always greeting, smiling and providing service that rivals Four Star properties. Simlply put I feel like at home with plenty of friends around to always put a welcoming smile to my day!!

<Content>This Hotel Is Awesome!!!!! My husband and I spent several days at the Affina 50 in Dec '04. It takes alot to impress me--and I was!! This hotel is spotless, the staff, all of them, went above and beyond to assure our every need was met. The rooms are huge--we had a junior suite, which was more room than we needed but after a full day of walking etc it was great to relax and have some personal space to boot! The beds were a dream to sleep on, the windows opened, the bathrooms are huge and the kitchen was a great room to have complete with coffee etc. The sofa and chairs were comfortable and I could find not one spec of dirt anywhere!! The linen was spotless. The price was very reasonable--and when we arrived the room was just as we had reserved--no surprises.My son had booked us a room at the Metropolitin, but after I read the reviews I was too concerned so changed ours to the Affinia 50. I was so happy I did as they had one disappointment after another at their hotel.We were just around the corner from them so it worked out great. I can't count how many times the kids said to us that they wished they had booked at the Affinia 50--but they just thought the Trip Advisor site was a bunch of people that had nothing better to do and would complain about just anything. Well--they are believers now!!We are from WA State and really wanted our trip to be special--and it was!! Thanks in large part to our wonderful time at the Affinia 50.

<Content>Wonderful NY Visit I was traveling to NYC for one night to see a play. During the holiday season hotel rates are marked up so I used a discount website.I booked a jr suite at the Affina 50 for myself and a friend. I was surprised by the excellent customer service and the wonderful decor. The room was spotless and stocked with Aveda products. There was a mini kitchen that was also spotless.It's an excellent place for families and a short walk to the subway. The location, E. 50th @Lexington, is far enough away from the Times Sq. hustle but still close to everything.They get 5 stars from me.

<Content>Loved Affinia 50 My husband and I looked online for hotels in NY for days and we read countless reviews on this site to help us decide where to stay. Because it is Dec., everything we had read good things about was booked up. We didn't know that the Affinia 50 was once named the Plaza 50 so we couldn't find reviews for it at the time we were looking. Affinia 50 had 1 room left so we reluctanly booked a Guest room there. We were so worried about what kind of hotel stay experience we were in for. To our very pleasant surprise, the Affinia 50 was wonderful. We had the smallest room they have but it was still spacious, especially compared to other hotels in NY. The room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable. The staff couldn't have been more hospitable. We had great service and we loved every minute of our stay. We will definitely stay at the Affinia 50 again.

<Content>Great Location, Huge Rooms I stayed at the Affinia 50 on two seperate occassions during Dec 2004. Great location. The staff are extremely helpful and courteous. The first time I stayed I was given a studio room on the 3rd floor, which was clean, modern and nice however it was slightly noisy. Checked in again a couple of days later and was given a 1Bd Suite on the 9th floor. What a surprize this room was HUGE !!! Definately reccommend this hotel, but ask to be put on a high floor, the lower rooms are noisy.

<Content>New York Surprise! My recent stay at the Affinia 50 was such a pleasant surprise, I feel compelled to write this review. There were many great things about the Affinia 50 that made my stay there special, and make it an excellent hotel:o Doorman - The gentleman there during the weeknights always had a smile on his face, recognized me, and made sure I didn't walk in the wrong direction. Best doorman I've ever met in New York, this after thirty years of frequent flyer traveling. He wears a distinctive grey derby.o Spaciousness - Unlike the typical NY city hotel, the rooms here are generously sized. It felt like the living room of a comfortable New York co-op.o Decor - Comfortable furnishings, the best bed and bedding I've ever had in a hotel. Most hotels have sterile lighting and fixtures. The Affinia 50 has modern variable intensity lighting on many fixtures, and they have been generous in wattage. The bathroom was very clean, well-equipped, and spacious. o Kitchen - When booking, I did not really realize that my unit would have a full-service kitchen, with refrigerator, microwave, stove-top and dishwasher! Comes equipped with table settings.o Location - Close to subways, and some great restaurants. If you like Italian cuisine, try nearby Giambelli's. They're still serving dishes where you can taste that $41,000 Italian white truffle they had won in a charity auction.o Staff - All in all, the best staff I've ever met in a New York hotel. From the maid to the front desk, always a kind word and a way of making you feel special! Never stuffy, just plain friendly and responsive. From check-in to check-out, it was amazingly consistent.Even the best hotel room in the world is just a room, but it's the way they treat you at the Affinia 50 that make it a great hotel.

<Content>Affinia 50 was great! The Affinia 50 really took care of us. Go to their Web site to get the best deals (www.affinia.com and click on Specials). We did their 50 Ways to Woo Your Lover with the rose petal turndown service (extra $20)...very romantic. Sicne we got in late, they had to upgrade us to the Junior Suite. Very NEW YORK...modern but still cozy! Plus the windows open...great to get some fresh air in a hotel now a days. They were in a GREAT location--only a block from the Waldorf Astoria and about a block and a half to two subway stations. I would defintely recommend it. And I would stay again in a heart beat. You can't beat the rate!

<Content>Absolutely Loved Plaza Fifty After much research online and reading reviews on numerous Manhattan hotels, I finally picked Plaza Fifty. There were eight of us: 1 studio suite w/two people, and 2 junior suites w/three each. The hotel rooms were all newly renovated, very large, and had extremely comfortable beds. Even the sofa bed was comfortable.The service we recieved was excellent and consistent over the six days we were there. This hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to major shopping, convenience/grocery stores, restaurants, and even night clubs.I couldn't believe the price we paid for the rooms. Even though I probably won't be able to get those prices again, I'm making Plaza Fifty my number one choice for my next NY visit.

<Content>Now the Affinia 50 Overall I really liked this hotel. It has its pros and cons, mostly pros, which I will address first.The Pros:Great location - 1 short block to the No. 6 lexington avenue subway line, this will get you everywhere from the Metropolitan Museeum of Art to Grand Central to Soho. Also, great neighborhood for convenient and good restaurants. We had really amazing Indian food at Jaipur on 2nd Ave. between 53rd and 54th Street. I am a huge fan of Indian food and very picky. Everything was excellent, especially the Chicken Tikka Masala.The price and the room - I don't know how much the prices fluctuate at this hotel but we got a great deal. $239 a night during peak season in Mid-October (we stayed 10/16-10/20 of 2004). This was for a one bedroom suite with kitchen that is larger than the Manhattan apartment I used to live in!The Club Room - they have a new common area club room on the 2nd floor. It offers complimentary bottled water, coffee and tea throughout the day and has several seating areas with big screen tv, fireplace, etc.. Mon - Thurs from 6pm to 7pm they have complimentary wine and cheese.The Cons:The hotel is not terribly upscale - the lobby is small and the staff while friendly is not very polished. However, it is very clean and all of the rooms were recently renovated as part of the re-opening of the Affinia 50. The renovation/redecoration while nice is on the cheap side ( the upholstery on the new couch had already started to tear - the carpet had stains).Overall if you can get this deal at this hotel do it. It's excellent, especially if you are traveling with children.

<Content>My New Favorite in NYC This weekend was my second stay at the Plaza Fifty and it was EVEN better than my first. I figured that 2 great experiences in a row deserved a positive review. The first time I stayed there in April 2004, my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by the large sized guest room we were given, which included a kitchenette area. We even had a great view from our windows of 3rd avenue. This is compared to other hotels that we have stayed in like Hotel 41, which is about the size of a closet and has a view of a wall. The icing on the cake was that we got the room at a special rate of about $140, a great deal for NY. The only complaint I had at the time was that the carpeting was a bright royal blue color. Other than that, the room was clean and the furniture was fine.This past Saturday night, my friend and I spent the night in the city and got a hotel room so that we didn't have to worry about catching the train home. Luckily, there were still rooms available at the Plaza Fifty, even though I called only a few days in advance. FYI, make sure you call the hotel since their online reservation system isn't always accurate. I ending up reserving our room through Travelocity since the rate was cheaper ($179). The best part came that night when we checked in. The awesome guy at the front desk (Sid? I think...) asked if it was our first time there and then asked who's birthday it was. My friend replied that it was her birthday about a month ago, and he went ahead and upgraded us to a junior suite! Apparently, the hotel is soon to be an executive club type hotel and was renovated in preparation. I knew the room would be big, but didn't know how amazing it would be...just renovated, all new furniture, a full-size kitchen with a table, the most comfortable hotel beds with down bedding, a balcony with a view, etc! It even smelled like a new room! We seriously could've lived there. Sid even called when we got upstairs to see what we thought of the room. Unfortunately, he wasn't working anymore by the time we were making our way out to the bars so we couldn't thank him again in person. But I hope that whoever is reading this will pass on the message to him and give him the credit that he deserves.All in all, I LOVE this hotel and am glad that I don't have to do anymore hotel researching for my trips to NY. I'm hoping that nothing about the hotel changes (I'm even willing to pay more if I know I'll enjoy my stay...) The staff is very friendly and helpful and the location is great (right near 2nd avenue bars/restaurants and only a few minute walk to 5th ave). It's definitely my favorite New York hotel!

<Content>Very Nice and Roomy for the price We had a jr. suite and our room was great! The price was relative to that of 4 and 5 star hotel rooms in NYC. We were glad that we stayed there. The beds were very comfortable and we even had a full kitchen and a large bathroom. Our hotel was far enough away but yet close enough to all the great places to see in NYC. The staff was always congenial and helpful. Could not have asked for more.

<Content>GREAT STAY AT THE PLAZA 50 Stayed June 10-14th. Nice hotel--close to major attractions and subway. Room included small microwave and fridge. Had to wash dishes (provided) in the bathroom sink but that was ok. Didn't use these as much as we intended because we were out most of day. True, there were renovations coing on but only was a slight problem when we came back in late afternoon to rest before going out for the evening. Had requested high room with view through Expedia and got the 4th floor with view of next building's wall and air conditioning unit. Disappointed because this was my first stay in NYC. Be specific on what you ask for (ie. view of street). Staff was friendly and helpful! Will stay again!

<Content>Absolutely loved the hotel! Stayed here with my daughters. Rooms were very clean and spacious. Staff was friendly - service and location excellent. The only problem was the renovation that was taking place. No noise at night, but one elevator was reserved for the workers, so we usually had to wait for the remaining one. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nice Place to Stay We enjoyed our recent stay at the Plaza Fifty. It is convenient to Rockefeller Center and other midtown attractions but far enough off the beaten path to afford a good value (we paid $159/night). The staff was very friendly and accomodating. Note that they are in the midst of gutting and remodeling every floor with the majority slated to be executive suites. Our floor was one of the last awaiting the wrecker and we received a wake up call one morning as renovation began on the floor above. However, since we were getting out to enjoy the city it was not a major inconvenience. The staff showed us the new room format and it was very nice. However, expect the rates to go up as the new rooms go into service.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised! We had a great long weekend at the Plaza 50! My husband was in New Jersey for business so our children and I (8 yr old and 8 mo old) joined him in NYC for a long weekend. When we arrived at 3:30am they did not have a Jr. Suite available so we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite. It was beautiful! It was newly renovated and very large. The bathroom was small, but the kitchenette and large living room more than made up for it. The entire suite was impeccably clean. I have travelled many, many times and this by far was the nicest budget-minded hotel I have ever stayed in. The beds were extremely comfortable (new).The hotel lobby, hallways and elevators are not at all impressive and very small, but the large clean rooms are a pleasant surprise when you open the room door. We could not hear a peep from other guests through the walls or hallways.The other bad reviews must have gotten older rooms before they were renovated. Ours was perfect. We will definately stay there again.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay My husband and I have just returned from a pleasant stay at the Plaza Fifty (April 16-19, 2004). This hotel was recommended by a friend who has also stayed here. This was not my first visit to NYC, so I was expecting a small, run-down hotel room. I was pleasantly surprised at how roomy our studio suite was! It's not a brand new hotel, but it's clean and the rooms are spacious. I found the desk staff to be noticably nice and helpful during our stay. We stayed on the 8th floor overlooking 50th Street. It was a little noisy in the morning due to the street noise and I believe they were renovating rooms on the floor above us. We ate at the New York Luncheonette next door which was inexpensive and quick for breakfast. We also ate at the George O'Neill restaurant next door for dinner which was good. As others on this site have said, the location of this hotel is ideal. I would stay here again based on the size/cleanliness of the rooms, the price, and the location.

<Content>Very satsified I was nervous about booking online, sight unseen, but the reviews of this hotel were all extremely accurate. The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. Our room was a large two room suite on the 7th floor overlooking 3rd Avenue, providing hours of entertainment during a huge snowstorm. The subway was close, but we walked to most tourist destinations, even during the snow. There are several decent restarants nearby. We especially enjoyed the bagels at Ess-a-bagel every morning. Don't expect fancy decor or the amenities of a large hotel, but do expect room to stretch out, kitchen facilities, a pleasant staff, and a decent rate.

<Content>What a find! We spent three nights at this hotel and couldn't be happier with our choice. Rooms were very clean, decor was tasteful, and staff were very helpful. We couldn't have gotten a better deal for the price. Close to mid-town in a moderately priced area. The little nuggets of information from the staff was priceless..ask them for the best places to eat and the best way to get where you are going..A wonderful stay in NYC! We will definitely be going back again
