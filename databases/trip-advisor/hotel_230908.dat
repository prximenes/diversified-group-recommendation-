<Content>A real memory - like a nightmare! This is easily the most memorable hotel our family has stayed it - for all the wrong reasons! It was booked online (non-refundable), so we did not know what what we were getting, but what an adventure! We had requested, non-smoking but got smoking! Our view was of the fire escape to the roof of another building...but the room - that was special! Entered the room to find a poorly repaired door (that had been recently kicked-in?). Poorly or unrepaired broken furnishings, huge dark stains on the carpet (coffe or blood?!?) and blood stains on the ceiling (bugs?). The best part was the smell of the room - like someone had just taken a C%^P and left it there. Surprisingly, the bathroom (except for the smell) was not as too nasty. If you want to part with your money for a truly nasty experience, please stay here - it will haunt your memories for years to come!

<Content>Nice but expensive Quite a nice hotel. Paid extra for a superior room with canal view. Should not have bothered. Room quite small. Looked out onto a very busy road, then the canal. Very noisy into the early hours. Room was warm and clean and the bathroom was nice. Breakfast not included in the room price. Breakfast in the hotel was expensive so ate out in the restaurants in Rembrandt Square every morning. Staff were friendly and helpful. Overall hotel was expensive for what it was.

<Content>Amstel Area Awesome As we decided to try going back to Amsterdam after our disappointment going to Th Belga...We Booked a City Break for couple of day Via KLM..The Area we chose was Amstel..(as before stayed in Jordaan area which was Very quiet not much night life)..Amstel was beautiful, with everything we needed for an awesome stay..The Eden Hotel was exactly as the pictures seemed...small but lovely rooms with bath/shower unlike our previous Trip where the Toilet was down corridor :(We Enjoyed everything about this second trip to AmsterdamThere were plenty of Clubs.... Cafe's....bars etc just a short walk Rebrandt square was lively and had awesome atmosphere...We are booking up for next year lolBut we will chose an apartment next time... but in the Amstel Area

<Content>One night ok - two nights, might like to think twice I thought I would give this hotel a try, as I needed a room near the centre, but didn't want to pay too much. I had read the pretty varied reviews and so approached this with an open mind.the hotel is relatively near to the centre of town, just two hundred yards from the nearest underground and just two stops from the central station and near some tram lines. You could walk pretty much anywhere without any problems and the local scenery of buidlings and canals is pretty much as expected for Amsterdam.The hotel doesn't look much from outside, but inside the lobby it is bright and quite pleasant. I found the reception staff and conceierge quite helpful and friendly.The hotel has been refurbished. The corridors and layout inside is a little bit like a rabbit warren. The room (a single room) was small, badly ventilated, openen onto a very tiny air vent (courtyard would be overdoing it). There was no bath, but a shower. Depsite its size, the room was full of the latest designs and quite comfortable. The bathroom was clean and funtional and modern, but so modern there wasn't anywhere to hang a towel.I was served breakfast in the main lounge - I am not sure if they have somewhere else for breakfast which might have a little more on offer. I received a stodgy croissant, hard bread roll, slice of cheese and slice of ham, along with coffee and a juice. A waste of money.I won't be adding this to my list of favourite hotels. I'll try and stay around the corner next time, or take my chance at another hotel, unless desperation sinks in. But for just over Euro 110 in big town what should we expect?

<Content>Extremely Rude Hotel Staff The staff at the front desk were the least helpful people I have ever encountered in a hotel. The first room that I was given was very dark, and when I asked for a different room I was charged an extra $35 Euro per night for a room that was smaller and had a bathroon that was the size of a cruise ship bathroom (thoughit was light filled). My hotel room was supposed to include breakfast, a city map and a welcome drink - I had to fight for each of these and rather than being given an apology for them not being included I was given the run around. I also asked to have a FedEx package shipped out and was told they could not help me - they would not even tell me where the nearest FedEx drop off was. I'm not sure if this was just an Anit-American sentiment or if they treat everyone this way, but I would never stay at this hotel again.I later moved to the Hotel Rembrandt where the staff were extremely pleasant, the room was large and comfortable, the building was historial and unique and the price was 1/2 that of the Eden Hotel.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at the Eden hotel 27 september on arrival the reception staff very good. the hotel does not look that great from the outside but once inside this all changed. a nice modern bar/resturant and reception area. the rooms are great with good beds lcd tv enough wardrobe space for the weekend and a very good clean bathroom. we had no mini bar or phone in our room (33) on the ground floor. but this did not bother us. we went as a group of ten and all said there rooms where to the same standard. we all had a great time in amsterdam and this hotel is one of the best i have stayed in. we will be going back to this hotel again very soon.

<Content>Awesome This is a great hotel in a great city centre location. It is close to all the action, within walking distance to all the sights, but lacking the noise and congestion. We stayed here for 3 nights - a queen size bed, clean sheets, nice private bathroom with shower, tv and internet access. There was a window in the room but it overlooked a middle alleyway of sorts and windows to other rooms - but who's looking out the window anyway? Reception was friendly as was the concierge. There was a bar in the hotel where breakfast was served, but we did not make use of it. It was clean and comfortable - I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Value for the price I paid I have to say I was very nervous about this hotel because of the reviews on this site. They are so hit or miss. I had a friend who had stayed here a number of times and always raved about it. What made my final decision was the price. I was there around Dec 20 and they had a FANTASTIC sale on hotel rooms through one of the hotel booking websites (not the hotel's website) where the room was $90 (with the service fee) a night. That's USD not Euros!! That's for a REAL hotel room, not a small budget accommdate that ran at that time for about $120 USD, some with shared baths. So I had to stay at the Eden for that price.I have to say, that my stay was very pleasurable. My husband and I had gotten separated before we made it to the hotel and he didn't know exactly where we were staying! Needless to say I was a bit upset about this situation. So I went to the reception and they were soooo helpful. A Front Desk clerk allowed me to use their front desk phone to call my husbands cell phone (a US number) as well as some family that lives in the Rotterdam area. I though that was very nice. Also, they brought me to the Internet stations so I could look something up (I can't remember what I needed on there) and got me a glass of water. And although I was very stressed, they went above  beyond in their help and made me feel much better. And those who are wondering, yes i did find my husband an hr later in Rembrandt Square.The room were nice. Typical hotel room. I have no complaints whatsoever. But there was construction going on until 5pm during the week at the time. Luckily most of my stay was over the weekend. The hallway lights were out when I arrived. I thought maybe there was some light trigger, but couldn't find it. So I was feeling the doors until I made it to my room. Turned out the lights were really out, so they put a couple of floor lamps in the corridor.One thing to watch out for is the breakfast. I didn't realize it wasn't included with my room and we had it one morning. It was 16euros a person! which was $50 blown on breakfast for much of nothing. If you go to breakfast and it's not included in your room, they will add it to your bill. So be careful if you choose it because the people checking you in at the breakfast room will not tell you that it is NOT included. If they had told me when I checked in for breakfast, I would have NEVER eaten there. There are great breakfast in rembrandt square. One I believed is called Opera cafe. It looks expensive, but a full egg breakfast was about 5euro and I got a great lunch ham sandwhich special for about 4euro that had sprouts and a nice bread. Very tasty and 9euros for both of us was better than the 32 for both of us at the hotel!So, all in all, if this price is placed well compared to other lesser quality accomodations, definitely go for the Eden.

<Content>not more than average location is prime, walking distance to pretty much all of central amsterdam! but it ends right there with the prime. rooms are small and crampy, cleanliness leaves to be desired, had dirty towels with holes. windows opened to a closed interior court, so not really any fresh air.. The bathroom is too large compared to the bedroom. no cloth hangers in the bathroom, only 1 bar to hang a towel, quite interesting if you are 2, as only 1 towel can dry.. 2nd night, no housekeeping provided though we left the room around noon and only came back around 16.00 (4 pm) had placed the please make up my room sign.. left again at 5 pm with the same sign outside.. nothing.. overall not really worth their regular rates.. we had a special rate so it was ok.. but would not recommend the hotel, except for the location..

<Content>Overpriced hotel. not worth the money. We stayed with a group of friends using this hotel and another nearby. My wife (who is disabled) and i felt the price per room at 鈧?44 with breakfast as an extra rather over the top. The room was small but clean but the hot water ran out on Saturday night. This affected the whole hotel and my party of friends was less than pleased as it meant none could shower and generally clean up before going out for the evening. Whilst staff apologised no compensation was forthcoming, not even a free drink at the bar. Surprisingly no mini bar in the room. The hallways on the first floor where we stayed could do with a coat of paint and our bathroom whilst modern was difficult to use and the ventilation fan did not work so got very steamy. The door to the bathroom did not work correctly either.On the friday night the disco in the bar was not welcome as my room was above the bar and the disco bass was far too high. Fortunately this ended early as the bar was emptyNot an impressive stay all all and rather overpriced.

<Content>Choose another hotel, this is not worth the money Room was tiny, they advertised large beds, but the bed in the double room was hardly queen size. If you didn't leave the room empty early enough (by 2pm or so), usually no cleaning was to be expected. Breakfast was disgusting, 9,50 euros for two pieces of dried out cheese, rotten (honestly, it was) garlic butter, pieces of white airy toast or rolls, bad coffee and bad orange juice. Breakfast buffet was 17,50, wasn't too tempted to try after the first breakfast experience. There was complimentary coffee, but many times only decaf, for some weird reason... Also more than one creamer a week seemed to be too much to hope for.Also they were proud about the view, well, our view was to some interior part, where no sky was to be seen, only the opposite wall. Also many small things that wouldn't require too much money were unsatisfactory, like no place where to hang your wet towel in the bathroom. No mirror, except the small one in the bathroom. Only positive surprise was free fixed line internet, provided you have your laptop with you, which I did.The staff was not very nice, when we came, the guy told us that we are lucky getting the last room as they are over booked. I had booked and paid the room 5 months before, so I damn well expect to have a room when I arrive! I don't mind staying in cheap dormitories with limited comfortability, but when I pay almost 1000 euros a week, I would expect a bit - no, a lot - more!!!! Please choose another hotel!

<Content>Decent Hotel Got a good advance rate online and have stayed at this hotel before so knew what I was getting. True the rooms can be small and the views well aren't really a view, but I love the hotel due to the good location, friendly staff and great decor.One negative is the smell, kind of raw sewage, I'd guess this hotel has old plumbing, but it was really quite bad coming from the bathroom and the trendy glass door doesn't seal the doorway so no way to stop it.Overall though I had a nice room, bigger than average and was happy.

<Content>Good location to get around, but not for relaxing holiday. After reading the review warning us not to get room 100 for the noise, we asked for different room, but was asked to pay extra 80 euros for it. So we just took the room they gave us, Room 308.Tiny, but clean and efficient. RIps on bed linen, but didn't notice till 2nd day. The room looked right across the next building's windows, so we had to have our curtains shut most of the time. Be aware! EXTREMELY noisy till dawn from the bar, nightclub next door. We couldn't sleep well for the whole 2 nights. Hotel location was very convenient. Beautiful canal and bridge, 10 minutes walk to Waterlooplein metro station, 10 minutes walk to catch tram in Rembrandtplein. I recommend this hotel for travellers who visit this city for late night drinking and parties. Not for those wanting a relaxing quiet holiday.I don't recommend dining in nearby Rembrandtplein. Get a tram to different areas. Poor choice of food, nothing dutch. Don't listen to hotel concierge's recommendation for food and good areas to go to. Do your research beforehand. Next time, we would rather stay near Rijksmuseum, or stay in a different city like Edam or Volendam which were beautiful.

<Content>An Absolutely WONDERFUL Hotel This hotel was WONDERFUL. The rooms were modern, clean, with all the ammenities. Hair dryer was good and powerful. Towels were thick and nice. TV had plenty of English channels. Front desk let us borrow a power adapter to use our U.S. appliances. Internet is free in the lobby -- no need to walk around looking for an internet cafe. Yippee. Location was EXCELLENT. We stayed in room # 100. At first I was afraid it might be noisy since we were close to a main hallway, but we heard NOTHING at all. It was quiet and peaceful. View was not good, but who cares. The room was spacious enough, the bed was amazingly comfortable with a feather mattress. We feel asleep so fast at night. The breakfast downstairs was amazing. I grabbed a bunch of brochures in the lobby because I am recommending this place to all my friends and family who are planning trips to Amsterdam.

<Content>Noisy, cramped room For a 'double occupancy' our standard double room in this hotel was terribly cramped. There was very little light as the room looked out onto to a service shaft with a dis-functioning air condition unit at the bottom of the shaft. If we opened the curtains the room occupants opposite us could see directly in to our room so we had to shut them. If we opened the window all we could hear was the noisy unit. I didn't get much sleep because of the unit noise. It was hard to see anything apart from the service duct as the room was on the first floor - suggest avoidance of room 113 at all costs! The beds were far too soft and the duvets seemed to be a very high 'tog' as we 'cooked' every night unless the window was open. Suggest you ask where the room is and what its outlook is like prior to booking at this hotel. The bar staff were ok but the alcohol prices very high. The room was a rip off at the high price we were charged.

<Content>Dirty, Overpriced hotel We just returned from a 4 nite stay and were extremely disappointed. We had to upgrade twice to an executive room for over $400 a nite to have enough room for two adults to both stand on the floor at the same time. When we got ready for bed and turned back the covers it was to find blood stained sheets and dirty pillowcases...obviously the linens had not been changed from the previous tenant. The chambermaid balked at changing the linens since it was someone else's job. We finally got the sheets changed the next morning, but the bloody bath mat was refolded and replaced for three days straight. Even in the hotel's bar, I was served a glass of wine in a lipstick covered, sticky, obviously dirty wine glass. The hotel had a nice location and most of the staff were pleasant as well as unhelpful, but I have never stayed in a hotel with such disgustingly filthy and unsanitary housekeeping.

<Content>Good location, needs improvement The hotel has a good location and is within walking distance of the canal hop on hop off boat. The concierge was very helpful. The front desk staff need to be more patient, understanding and helpful. First I was told my room was ready, only to find out it had one bed and not two. Then I had to wait until late afternoon to check in and the room was very small for two people. The worst was the bathroom door was frosted and you could see thru it. It was small and cramped in there with hardly any space for your toilettries. The carpeting was so old it hurt your feet to walk on it barefoot! The breakfast was not worth the price. It did not have a good variety of foods to chose from. There was no one at the door to help you with your luggage when you first arrived. The concierge's desk was small and always had people waiting online to book something. He was the nicest person on staff and very friendly. The only thing going for this hotel was the location and a nice concierge. The rooms are too small, and they need brighter colors and a complete overhall to make it look more presentable. This should be a two star and not a three star hotel.

<Content>A Great Memory! I stayed at Eden Hotel Amsterdam for 3 nights and I was excited! Very friendly and helpful staff, very clean room and the beds were very comfortable. I was reading the reviews here and some people were suggesting to ask for a room on the 4th or 5th floor. I did that and I ended up with a tiny room like an attic and the window was facing a grey wall. I immediately made a complain at he front desk and the receptionist gave me a room on the second floor. As soon as I entered the room i said WOW, it was a large room facing the canal. Amazing view! Huge beds, very spacious room in general. The hotel is located close to Rembrandt square and the flower market but quite far from Leidseplein which is the best place to spend your evening/night as a tourist because it is one of the most lively areas of Amsterdam where all the restaurants and bars are found. We had to take a tram and then walk for a while to reach Leidseplein. Moreover, the hotel is about 3 tram stops to Dam square or a 20 minutes walk.

<Content>Comfortable but noisy Stayed at the Eden Hotel over the Easter period. Took the train from Amsterdam airport to the city centre and realise the hotel was at least half an hour walk through the busy main street. Alternatively, can catch the tram from the train station. The interior decor is modern and the room is a reasonable size. I couldn't say the room was spotless clean as lots of hair was found the basin, a bit disgusting. It can get quite noisy at night, can hear laughters and shouts from the next room. The hotel is located close to Rembrandtplein, and roughly 20 mins walk from the red light district or 30mins from the museums.

<Content>Comfortable, clean, hotel This was my first trip to Amsterdam, over the Easter period, with a friend sharing a room at the Eden Hotel.I found the room to be kept very clean and comfy although a bit cosy for two adults to move around in at the same time (please take comments about *all* Nederland/European hotels having similar tiny spaces with a pinch of salt, this is a rather sweeping generalisation unless you are used to having an entire penthouse suite.)I would recommend the hotel entirely for staff helpfulness: lending out travel adaptor plugs, gaining access to wifi, storing luggage on check out for a later collection.This is a very popular and busy hotel, especially for the 20's to 30's age range, so if you are a light or easily disturbed sleeper do take earplugs as there is usually some noise through the corridors at night. Oh, and this also goes for the rooms that only have single glazing and look out onto the side alley. Morning deliveries of beer to a bar do start around 7.00 a.m.That aside it makes an excellent base to explore the area and it is reasonably priced if you are sharing.

<Content>Fairly priced hotel Recently got back from a long weekend in Amsterdam with my girlfriend - I'm 30yrs, her 26yrs. I have been many times but generally staying with friends who lived there.Chose hotel due to location, right on top of Rembrandt square and in the middle of leidsplein/vondel park and the centre of town the other way.Room was newly refurbished (according to reception all renovations are now complete, but I only saw our room) and although extremely compact it was fine to sleep in and spend minimal time getting ready to go out for the day/night. Overally I found the standard of the hotel and price to be pretty good  would definately consider it again if I return to the dam.We got an all in 3night stay (thurs-sun) and flights with Expedia for about 拢300 for both of us.

<Content>I would stay here again After reading some reviews on the Eden Hotel Amsterdam, I was unsure of what I would arrive to. But I was very satisfied with my stay.Per previous postings, I requested a renovated room and also one in a quiet area (not overlooking nightclubs or near renovations). My request was kindly granted and the room was clean and had comfortable beds.Sure the room was a bit on the small side, but you are in Europe, get used to it. Besides, you are in Amsterdam, how much time are you really going to spend in a hotel room.The location was great, near lots of sights and close to the tram line.If I return to Amsterdam, I would stay here again.

<Content>generally good  the good:It's located in a great zone,rembrantplein,practicaly in the center of Amsterdam. The room was newly refurb and modern and decently clean.The most incredibly confortable beds!Free internet in the hotel lounge.the bad:The room we booked via internet was a double standard.It was normal size but with a terrible view towards the wall of the other building. There was never natural light as it was on the second floor. The cleaning ladys dont do much apart from making the bed and changing the towles. We did't have breakfast as it was 18euros per person and didn't seem like worthing it. Go and have breakfast in the self service restaurant LA PLACE...its great and cheap!Generally it's good and good price for the location.

<Content>Heavenly Beds We loved this hotel! We stayed here for 2 nights. The staff was great, but the best thing was the newly updated room. In fact, we were the first people to sleep in this new room. The new beds and comforters were so comfortable and soft, it was like lying on a cloud. The staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful, and the hotel is located in a very good central area not far (3 minutes on foot) from tram stations, restaurants and pubs. The one negative thing was that they are renovating the hotel, so the construction workers were working starting around 8 a.m., which didn't bother us because we wake up pretty early, but another guest was rather annoyed and too harsh about it with the front desk staff. We really enjoyed our stay here.

<Content>Absolutely brilliant After reading the reviews on this site I was a little unsure as to what the hotel would be like. I went with my Partner and our two friendsI can honestly say it was fabulous! The staff were really friendly and always happy to help. The rooms were very modern and very clean, I was impressed considering this was rated as a 3* hotel I would rate it at least a 4*. I asked on arrival for one of the refurbished rooms which I was given.There is a bar at the entrance, with comfy seating for you to chill out and drink or eat and also a internet area and smoking area. I dont think the pictures on the website do it justice to how nice it is.I would say this is ideally located as you are within a 5 minute walk from bars and restaurants and about a 20/ 30 walk to Dam Square, but everywhere is accessible as you can jump on a tram and be there in no time!I would higher recommed this hotel!

<Content>Great Location,Tiny rooms - fight for a clean one! Ok,lets start with the positives: The hotel is in an excellent location by rembrandt square  within walking distance of all the major attractions. The room we ended up with was clean  newly renovated. Now the negatives: When we arrived we were told that a canal view room would be 30 euros extra per night.We refused  the receptionist offered an apartment with canal view for the same price... What we entered was not 3 star quality it was infact a dingy squat-like smelly hole with furniture from the 70's  mould from around the same period.Having read other reviews of the hotel mentioning renovated rooms I marched back to the desk  requested one.We were given a room on the 4th floor which was indeed renovated  clean.However there was a major problem - unless you are extremely thin or like pot-holing you will find the room tiny.It is without doubt the smallest room i have ever stayed in  I can't imagine our American friends being too impressed.It was so claustrophobic we spent as much time away from the room as possible.Having said all of this we enjoyed our time in Amsterdam enormously  would recommend the hotel on its location alone.My advice would be that when you book ,request in writing that you will be in a renovated room.Another word of warning - the food in the hotel is ridiculously overpriced  the selection is poor.We asked for a regular green salad - just leaves  tomatoes  were told that as the restaurant is 'Typically French' the chef did not have these ingredients...my boyfriend is French...this did not go down well! If you want a cheap option for brfeakfast go to the 'La Place Mangerie' on Rokin - they have every kind of food imaginable at very reasonable prices.

<Content>Overall very nice I liked this hotel. The location is very good, on a canal, and very near Rembrandt Square. Our room was small, but the bed was VERY comfortable, and the decor was modern. Our room had obviously been remodeled recently, and was kept quite clean as well. I noticed other reviews mentioned noise and thin walls, but we never heard anything (our room was on the 1st or 2nd floor, I think); in fact it was very quiet. All in all, the hotel had everything we needed, at a reasonable price.

<Content>Comfortable but cramped I stayed here for three nights in Dec. Whilst we were on a budget we tried to get a decent hotel for our money. The hotel itself was very clean,tidy and modern and well equipped. Our beds were extremely comfortable but the room was let down by the size of the bathroom. The door was made of frosted glass and you had to open it outward into the bedroom. If you opened it inward, you banged it into the toilet. The shower doors were similar. There was very little space to put your toiletries, and I'm glad I didn't take my cat as there wouldn't have been room to swing it! The maid service also left a lot to be desired. On the first day we were a towel short and had to ask for another. My friend broke a coffe mug which was not replaced and the shower gel ran out and was not replenished. The floor also didn't look like it was hoovered on the second day. Quite poor. The bar area was nice and not too overpriced, the menu looked good too, although we never ate in there. Neither did we have breakfast as it was an additional 16 Euros. You will also get charged tourist tax on cecking out which in2.5 Euros. Whilst I was checking out, the receptionist was half way through dealing with me when she ignored me in favour of taking a reservation over the phone. Very rude. On the plus side the concierage was very helpful and his English was good. Not a bad location but there are others that are probably more central for the same price.

<Content>Reasonable hotel This hotel is a decent place to stay, the lobby is very good and clean as are the rooms. they are however quite basic and the walls are made of paper and don't stop any noise. The staff were very helpful and frendly, overall i would stay here again as i said, it's clean and in a decent location.

<Content>Great Location....but..... I had read the reviews, somewhat mixed, but Amsterdam I found out can be an expensive city, so the price was reasonable at this Hotel, so we booked a room for 2 nights. I had read reviews to ask for a renovated room on the 4 or 5 floor, our first room was on the 5th, it was defenitly not newly remodeled. Our next try was on the 4th floor, I asked the front desk directly for one of their renovated rooms, we got a room on the 4th floor, looked about the same, had a small window overlooking the street and canal, we settled. So if any of you have stayed at hotels with rooms overlooking the street, nice for looking out at the local life ...but NOISY! The walls were super thin, it almost felt sometimes that we were not alone in the room, the voices from next door, and below really carried. The rooms were really basic and looked nothing like the pictures advertised on the website. The positives.....The location was close to everything, and was pretty easy to get to. The lobby is really nice, and looks like it was remodeled....they had free internet in the cafe. My friend that I was traveling with was great , and made the trip for me, so it didnt matter where we stayed,,,,,,, but I think that there are others hotels that would give you more value, and charm, so keeping looking!

<Content>Hated it. Our room was awful. Service was fine. The location is nice, right around the theater, in Central Amsterdam. When you walk in, the lobby and reception area looks nice and updated. The concierge was very helpful with other guests, I was sitting in the reception area, waiting for my BF and watched. Service was fine. We had no problems with service.However, our room was awful. Dreadful. It was #137. I made sure to save the key card holder. I guess we checked in too late, they gave our original room away, #439. Maybe the higher the floor, the better the room? What I do know is that our room was a decent size, ugly as heck, the bed wasn't that comfortable, and the blanket was an army green fleece thing that I wouldn't keep in my own home. There was hardly any decor except for a tiny mirror and two cow portraits above our bed. That's not the worst part, the worst part is that we were somewhere next to the laundry room and I could hear it spinning ALL night. I could hardly sleep, not to mention the walls are very thin!!! I could hear everyone in the hallway, but they were loud. And be sure to lock your doors at night, someone tried to get into our room, but I think it was because he was drunk and didn't realize it was the wrong room. I later heard him next door talking so I'm pretty sure that's what happened. The price is rather inexpensive given the location so I think it might have more than its fair share of young rowdy people at night.I'm not even 30 yet, but I was annoyed as heck at all the noise till the early morning. Do not stay at this hotel! We were only there one night so we couldn't request another room.

<Content>Good Value, Good Location We stayed at the Best Western Eden for 2 nights in October, 2007. We had 3 rooms, all were very clean and in good condition. Location was pretty good. The only negatives were 1) breakfast is 16 Euro per person if not included in the rom rate, and it is definetely not worth the price 2) a 5 minute phone call to the US cost over 70 Euro - don't do it if you don;t have to!!

<Content>Good Value, Central Location This hotel is located close to most tourist amenities in the centre of Amsterdam. A pair of converted heritage properties, the change has been done with care to provide accommodation that is quiet and comfortable.Provides an excellent base for those who wish to explore Amsterdam.Room 413 is the one I stayed in. It is of reasonable size and in reasonable condition, but shows some wear and tear as a result of high occupancy rates. Problems with a defective tap (faucet) were resolved quickly and effectively though.Many rooms have no view, with windows opening on a central light well, as a result of the narrow frontage but deep construction of the building.Check-in and check-out is conducted quickly and efficiently.Bar and restaurant have an excellent ambience, but service was a little slow.On the whole, an excellent experience.

<Content>BEST western My husband and I stayed at the Eden for 3 nights (11-13 Sept 07) and could not genuinely fault anything about the hotel.We had read mixed reviews of the hotel, but given the location and price (We got a great rate from the Best Western website of around 鈧?00 per night) we thought we would give it a go - we were not disappointed.The lobby is first class, and all the staff helpful. We originally arrived about 3 hours earlier than our check in time and there was no problems with us leaving our luggage in a secure room while we went off to explore. When we returned, we were given our key and went to check out our room.The room was on the 3rd floor and had not yet been updated (although there were a few signs around the hotel that showed further work was planned) but was spacious, faced the canal and was clean. There was noise from the street below (mainly traffic rather than people) but as we were in the city we expected this - apparently this was still much quieter than up near Dam square)We found the location to be ideal - approx 20 minutes walk from Central Station and another 20 minutes south to the Liedesplein/Museum quarter, with Dam square being a quick 5/10 min's away - we walked everywhere! A note to all people heading to Amsterdam, the 'pavements' and roads are manic with vehicles coming from every direction; make sure you keep alert at all times.All in all the hotel was better than expected, and the location faultless - I would definitely return and recommend it to anyone.

<Content>BW- Eden hotel From reading these reviews we knew that there was one side of the hotel that was older, and another side that was newly renovated. At first they gave us a hotel in the older side of the hotel-- dark, depressing, no air conditioning, old TV, and not exactly up to the standers of cleanliness i would want. We went right back down and said that we would like to be moved to the recently renovated part of the hotel. Reluctantly we were moved. The new room was ALOT nicer! It was bright, modern, air conditioning, and a new TV. Other than the receptionists i found the staff very friendly. Also the Eden hotel has two computers in the main reception area for guests to use FREE internet, which is definitely a bonus. We didn鈥檛 eat the breakfast because it wasn鈥檛 included in our rates, and we were told at check in it was 22 euros, which we thought to be way too expensive. There鈥檚 plenty of places to grab some breakfast for a quarter of the cost, just blocks away.Awesome location, right on the cannel and steps away from a bunch of restaurants and a main shopping street. It is in walking distance of pretty much everywhere, my boyfriend and i only used the tram twice and that was to get to and from the central station.

<Content>Watch out! I figured I had no reason to worry about the hotel as I entered the lobby. It looked ok and the staff was pleasant. I was given my room that seemed to be in a different building than the lobby as I had to trod through an indoor walkway before reaching it.At first glance the room seemed ok, but as I entered I realized that it stunk like a pot-party had just left minutes ago. Lampshades with holes in them, wallpaper torn in some areas. I opened the window just to be met by a view of two disco-balls and lights(!) hanging between the hotel and the next building and I had to make a choice of either getting rid of the stench or be kept awake by the noise from the club owning the discoballs. I opted for the latter as it was no a/c nor change of air in the room. The bathroom was spacious, but there was a lot of chips in the tub (no, not the potato-kind...) and the showercurtain was heavily milldewed.You might ask why I didn't ask for a new room. At the same time I was there, an international broadcasting conference was in town, occupying all that could be found of rooms in Amsterdam.The worst bit was when I layed down to try and go to sleep in the stench and noise from the club outside my window. The matress acted like a hammock would, making me feel like I tried sleeping in a miniature meteorite-crater. Did I mention that I found paperclips(!) under the covers?My colleague that stayed in a different part of the hotel got a totally different room and was very pleased - so when booking; watch out and try and beware that there might be a heaven-and-hell difference when it comes to the room-standard.

<Content>What a dump: or is the glass really 9/10 empty? There isn't enough room to write how awful this place is. One could start with the chaos of the check in process, go to the drabby lobby, surly staff, but that would only be looking at the glass being 9/10th empty instead of 1/10th full. We were given rooms with a canal view. Not being short people, the windows were usless. They started at the floor and came to my chest. Yes, one got a view of the canal, if you weren't afraid to lay down on filthy carpet. The noise from the traffic, so effectively transmitted throughout the room by the low windows, kept me up most of the night. The night staff seemed to think it an incovenience that someone would bring to their attention such problems. Life is too short; save your money; enjoy your vacation; go just about anywhere else in Amsterdam but this place.

<Author>TravelerfromCanada
<Content>Good stay again, 2nd time around My daughter and I stayed here first in August 2005, and I wrote a good review at that time. We arrived at Best Western Eden after being bumped from a cheaper hotel, so our rate was very cheap and it was a superb deal.This time around we got a pretty good deal also, although not quite so cheap. I booked a cancellable rate of 79 Euros per night, 10 months in advance, through the hotel web site. I specified two single beds, and a quiet room, because our last stay had a room over a noisy nightclub (as mentioned by others).The hotel has been renovated in part, and I think they are continuing to refurbish the rooms. We arrived and noticed the lobby check-in area had been updated in a contemporary style. We were checked into our room, but discovered it had a double bed. I noticed it was refurbished and in a contemporary style, but rather small and poky, with little natural light. In any event, we needed two beds, although I knew they'd be in the adjacent formation.So I went back to the desk, and the clerk told us she'd have to give us an older room. This was fine, and we got a room that was extremely similar to our room two years ago. It's a bit worn, but everything was clean and in reasonably good condition. The room was larger than the more contemporary one, with more light. On our last visit, breakfast was included. I wasn't initially planning to have breakfast here, given the 16 Euro rate, but when we were raring to go at 7 AM, we decided we might as well. No breakfast cafes were open at that time, according to our guidebooks, and we wouldn't have the same choice and quantity of food. So we splurged that day, and splurged the next, and I think it was worth it. The third day we had to leave too early for breakfast, due to onward travel.The location remains extremely central, convenient, and pleasant. The only unfortunate thing is that for future visits, the hotel seems to have increased its rates significantly, when I checked the web site to consider a possible future stay. One note for families: The hotel web site does allow a free child 11 and under, but you will not get an extra bed for the child. The terms say something like existing bedding. I saw one disappointed mother ask about this at the desk.

<Content>Cool hotel, great location, great room After a long journey to Amsterdam from NYC, this hotel was a great way to wind down. My room was quite cool and stylish, with a nice cozy bathroom. My only negative comment was that the breakfast was terrible and overpriced. Other then that, i'd recommend this hotel to anyone

<Content>Lovely room, great location I鈥檓 not sure if some of the reviews below are even of the same Best Western Eden hotel that my boyfriend and I stayed in from 12th to 14th August!Just so you can check, the Best Western Eden that we stayed at was on the Amstel just infront of Rembrantplein right on the canal and I can honestly say that it was perfect for the two night break we were on.We paid 79EUR per night (excluding breakfast) and got great value for money. We were given a lovely room on the 4th floor (room 403)鈥?it was huge and had a desk and two chairs and the comfiest bed I鈥檝e slept in in ages! Even though only floor 5 is marked as non smoking on the lift buttons 鈥?ours was actually non smoking too. There were two windows which both looked out over the internal courtyard but this didn鈥檛 worry us as the only time we spent in the room was when we were sleeping. Also it meant that we didn鈥檛 get any street noise which has often been a problem on other city breaks. Housekeeping came round quite early each morning (between 9 and 10) but if you want a lie in then put your do not disturb sign up and they won鈥檛 knock. We did this and then when we came back from our day out and about the room had been serviced while we were gone so there鈥檚 no need to worry about missing out on the morning rounds.Staff at reception were not overly friendly but were also not rude 鈥?just efficient. We only dealt with them at check in and check out so did not have much contact with them. We didn鈥檛 have the breakfast as it鈥檚 much cheaper to go somewhere else and get something.Overall it was a great place to stay for a laid back couple of days. As lots of people have said the location was brilliant for seeing Amsterdam 鈥?we walked everywhere and I鈥檇 definitely recommend people to stay here. Given how nice the room was I鈥檇 definitely give it a 3*+.

<Content>Walked in room and then walked out! This hotel was the worst hotel I have never stayed in. My husband and I arrived our 2nd trip to Amsterdam exicited and hoping our hotel would be as awsome as another hotel in Basel, Switzerland. But when we got to the hotel, the lobby was run down (which was a clue to the rest of the hotel). When we got to our sparse room with one small window facing a brick wall, there were stains on the carpets and decor that was so dreadful we immediately got on the internet to find another accomodation. There was no way I could ever actually sleep or even sit on the bed. It was just run down and didn't look clean.We did find a wonderful hotel not too far away (Hotel Toren) and immediately moved our belongings. The so-called bellhops saw us leaving with our bags after just arriving with our bags, and never asked what was wrong or offered to help. We were willing to pay for that nignt, but when we tried to cancel our 2nd night, the hotel had already charged our card and said that it was too late. This hotel was so bad that we completely paid for it and nevertheless paid for another hotel to actually stay in.

<Content>Hmm.... Nice and safe neighborhood. Terrible experience, they put me in a room on the basement, next to the kitchen. First of all, there was no remote control for TV (so can't turn it on), no soap in my room and a few flies in the bathroom. After I checked in, I left for a long walk and returned around 8pm. Believe it or not, there were many flies in the room. I rang up the front desk and after several minutes of complaint, he switched me to other room on the same floor (still the BASEMENT). I know I should write my comment or warning early.

<Content>Clean and comfortable, but certainly not posh We paid about 拢60 per room per night for this hotel, including breakfast, which I think is a really good deal for this location. The room was an ok size, with double bed, desk, table and two chairs and a wardrobe. The wardrobe had a safe in it (always welcome), but there was no mini-bar (probably for the best!). The bed was very comfortable, alas, as it was Amsterdam, we didn't really spend enough time in it. Bathroom was clean, but carpet throughout the room was stained, however, really, in the grand scheme of things, does it matter? There was no Air con, but there was a large fan that was quiet. Didn't take any photos of the room, but it was one of the old-style ones.Staff were pleasant and welcoming. Breakfast was weird, as breakfasts in hotels often are! Chives in eggs! Cucumber! AT breakfast! Location is superb, but would probably not stay here again, just so that we could experience a different part of town. However, as I said at the beginning, for that sort of price, you can't go too far wrong.

<Content>Good Base of Operations in Amsterdam Amsterdam was the last stop on our European Adventure and the Best Western Eden was a great base of operation-- especially if you like to walk and explore the way we do! Located on the Amstel River we walked everywhere -- didn't take public transpo until the morning we had to catch our flight home.The hotel was clean with a roomy bathroom(though the carpet and wallpaper was a little worn looking in places). The beds were also pretty comfortable. We stayed on the 5th floor which was the non smoking floor. The room didn't smell at all like smoke though the hall smelled a little smoky.The hotel had a couple of computers on the first floor with free internet access which was another plus but as they were free there was frequently a bit of a wait to get on.Not the most fabulous place but nice and clean enough that you're not skeeved out .

<Content>Best Avoided Despite alot of negative feedback me and my friend stayed here for 2 nights in July 2007. First of all if you are offered the chance to stay in the 'Apartments' (for want of a better word) then decline them, We were offered them and the way the staff speak it sounds like this is an upgrade, it is far from it. The apartments are small, shabby and dont look safe at all. We changed rooms and the room was average, although I have stayed in better rooms in Best Western hotels before. The main bugbear was that there was no mini bar. When we were at reception we overheard a couple who had had their bags stolen including credit cards etc just moments before we arived, For this reason we used the safe in the room and to be safe put the sign on the door so that the rooms wernt cleaned. A small price to bay for the safety of our belongings. To be fair the hotel lobby and bar looked quite posh and the concierge was happy to help. But I dont reccomend this hotel, there are probably better ones for the same price!

<Content>Could have felt safer.. Me and a friend of mine stayed in this hotel during July 07 and it isn't as bad as some make out.When we told the receptionist that we had reservation, she offered an apartment for free, so we accepted. The apartment was a 2 minute walk round the corner and was like some sort of youth hostel, so we asked for a room back in the hotel and they did it, but there was a couple there whose luggage was robbed whilst they were waiting to check in.We used the free safes in the room to prevent any theft and the hotel was clean and comfortable and quite central.I can see why some people have had bad experiences though.

<Content>no problems at all with this hotel we had no smoking rooms on 5th floor, they did look out over the rooms opposite but we were only there one night  there was no outside noisesThe rooms were on the small side especially the single one which had a double bed but had everything one could need for a weekend break,the bed was the most comfortable ever! Hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff helpful.The location is ideal,just two metro stops from Central Station or tram stops nearby.We didn't think the breakfast could be worth 16e each so we went to a big supermarket near the Rijksmuseum and sat in the park with some croissants and fruit salad - cost 16e for 3 of us. We would stay there again and recommend it

<Content>Surprisingly good When we arrived at this hotel we were more than pleased - until we found out we had actually entered on the four star side. The hotel actually combines two different hotels and so we were led through to our three star section. Upon checking in, the staff could, in all honesty, have been a tad friendlier, but the concierge was outstanding, so this made up for the reception staff's apparent lack of enthusiasm.The rooms were of adequate size for what we paid, and pleasantly furnished and decorated. The bathrooms are nice and although the view was unfortunately lacking in anything interesting (we could see a walkway between other floors of the hotel), this is not what we came to Amsterdam for, so we didn't mind.I travelled to this hotel with five friends, so had the opportunity to see three rooms, and they were all to our liking.

<Content>Queens day bargain  My girlfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights. The room was small, but we're used to that having traveled to Europe many times. The room clean and centrally located, nothing took more than twenty minutes to walk to. Matresses were very cozy considering the rating this hotel got. I was very pleased with my stay here.

<Content>so-so Our company had three rooms for the weekend. Only one rooom had outside window, but was extremely small, under 10 sq. meters. Another two were bit biger, but dark, with windows facing not real outside, but kind of saft, opposite wall not further than 2 meters.Breakfast was very average, no vegetables, only some fruit.It's worth to book only for significantly reduced price, not for full rate.

<Content>Unfriendly staff Check in staff was rude. Got a better rate and tried to charge old rate. They had a chip on their shoulder and were snippy. Tried to put luggage in holding area and he said I'll be there later I waited 10 minutes. The hotel is old and dumpy compared to other Best Westerns in other countries such as Australia, Italy, Greece and the USA.

<Content>Great Hotel - Definitely Recommended We stayed there twice. The first five days we stayed in room 310. Newly refurbished and very clean. Nice plasma TV and upgraded bathroom. Very small room even by Tokyo standards but we made due as this was one of their econony rooms. We returned seven days later and stayed in room 403. Five times larger and also newly refurbished with the same amenities. Not much of a view but again this was one of the economy rooms. Had breakfast once and it was adequate... nothing fancy. Would recommend going through the passage way to the sister 4-star Eden hotel and eat there. Higher quality indeed. The staff way great. Very friendly and helpful. The location was perfect. We will definately stay there again and would highly recommend it. to any budget minded traveler. Very close to the trams,many restaurants and five minutes walk to Rembrant Plein and Muntplein. Felt very safe walking the streets late at night. Safe in room for valuables.

<Content>Thieves! I made the mistake of leaving my watch at the side of my bed. I went to wear it that same night, and noticed it had gone. I informed the supervisor, and said that it had gone. She said that she would have a word with the cleaners the next day, as they were not there until the morning. The next day came and the cleaner knocked on our door to clean the room. I asked her if she'd cleaned the room the previous day, and said that a watch had gone from the room. She didn't seem to know what a watch was, so I pointed to my wrist, and she replied 'no'. She said that she would go and get her supervisor, and walked off. The supervisor never came, so either she wasn't bothered, or the cleaner wanted to make a quick escape. We went down to the reception, and asked if the watch had been found, the receptionist told us to take a seat while she went and got the supervisor. We waited for 15 minutes. She eventually came, and said that the cleaner was one of the best, and that she had said the room was a mess, and that it might have got lost in my belongings. The room wasn't a mess, I had a abit of make-up on the dressing table. I said that I had checked my belongings numerous times, as you would before you go making accusations. She replied by saying, that if we find it, we will send you it in the post. She wasn't at all apologetic, she seemed to be blaming us!I didn't go to the police, as it was out last day, and I didn't want anything else spoiling our holiday, which I regret. If you are planning on staying at this hotel, beware of the cleaners, and anyone else who has a key to your room, 'they can't be trusted!!!!'Next time I go on holiday, I shall be packing everything I own into my suitcase everytime I step outside of the room, and will have a giant padlock on it!

<Content>Don't Go There! My husband and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel and what an unpleasant experience it was! Room number 39. To be avoided at all costs. Small room, very dark due to tiny window in far corner. Room situated next door to staff room so they would congregate outside our window smoking and chatting on and off from 6AM, therefore we had to keep curtain closed all the time, anyway. Adjoining door outside our room leading to the hotel lobby was continually being opened and closed by staff as they made their way from staffroom into hotel proper. Door not a gradual closing door, rather, it slammed, which we again were subjected to from around 6AM. On asking to move rooms I was told most of the rooms were the same, but if I wanted a better one this would cost extra money each night. Great location, but terrible hotel.

<Content>Location is good, ear plugs are needed The hotel location is good, at the opposite of The Artis Zoo. Neighbourhood is safe and there are no noisy bars or nightclubs near. But the room lets all the possible noises in, so it's really difficult to sleep if you have no ear plugs. You can hear clearly all the steps and talking outside and inside the hotel. At least in our room, at the ground floor. Maybe it's better in the upper floors... The room and bathroom are quite small, but there was enough room at least for two normal-sized ladies. There is internet at the lobby (5鈧?15min). Free sweets and apples at the reception. You can buy soft drinks, water and juice with coins, but it's quite expensive (water 3鈧?/ half liter), so I recommend buying them at the supermarket before coming to the hotel (we found no supermarkets near the hotel).We did not eat breakfast at the hotel (15鈧?. It's only a few minutes walk to other places where they sell breakfast.

<Content>Enjoyable stay! We stayed in the Best Western Eden Hotel in April 2007. We were very lucky because my husband and I got a brand new renovated room at the backside of the hotel. The decoration of the hotelroom as well as the lobby area is very nice. It looks very modern, and the beds are great! Our room had airconditioning and coffee and tea making facilities....great! The location of the hotel is perfect! The staff was very helpfull explaining us what to do in Amsterdam. I would recommend this hotel to everybody who is looking for a city centre location in Amsterdam!

<Content>Excellent location The best western is right on the Amstel opposite the opera house. It is in walking distance of every attracion. We didnt take any other transport. From Amsterdam Centraal station it is a straight walk up the Damrak about 15 mins.The bar/reception area is very nicely decorated and the staff are welcomin. We arrived at 11.30 am and went ot eh desk to check in and were surprised to be given our room key as check isnt until 3pm. The corridors leading to the rooms are very dark and dingy but your not in them long! When we open the door to the room it was VERy apparent that it hadnt been cleaned since the provious pccupants left.Bed was dirty and unmade and there was a lot of brokne glass on the floor of the bathroom.I called recpetion immediatly and they said they would get on to it. We left our luggage and went out to see th sights.When we retuened the room was clean and presnetable. Not a great start but didnt spoil the trip.Thr room (508) was small but it had everyhting you need for a city break. Bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom!The concierge was very helpful and stored our lugagge for us the next day.Over all for a city break hotel it does the job. I paid 99 euros plus 4 euros tourist tax and i wouldnt say it was worth any more than that! and one last thing dont pay for hotel breakfasts unless they are included. there are LOADS of cafes that will do one for half the price!

<Content>Location, Location The best feature of this hotel is its location. You can walk to most major attractions in Amsterdam. We arrived early after an overnite flight, and were told to come back at 3pm for check-in. I was placed in the older part of the hotel and my friend scored a room in the newly renovated section. Once I saw HER room , I went to reception and asked to change if possible. By then, the evening shift reception came on duty and they could'nt have been more pleasant. The receptionist switched me to the same floor as my friend, and in a newly renovated room. The old rooms are drab, boring and I almost can't believe they give these rooms to people. The newly renovated ones have a gorgeous new bathroom, LCD TV on the wall and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in a hotel. Noise was not a problem for us as well. The breakfast buffet was average, but since it was included in the price no complaints. One strange feature is the elevator, it holds only 4 people and there is only one. For a hotel of this size, thats nuts. Also, for you Americans- there is no washcloth in the bathrooms. I brought my own after reading previous reviews. They give you a large thin towel of sorts to use. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, cheap and expensive alike. The conceirge was great and told us of a great deal for meals by the floating flower market....the VD department store has an amazing food court! We also found a chinese restaurant that had a buffet , its all you can eat in one hour! Amsterdam is a lovely city, the people are friendly, and go when the tulips are blooming at Keukenhof !I would stay here again, but only in the new section.

<Content>Almost ruined our trip You may have read our family's previous entry Saved my life! We had stayed at this hotel last summer for 3 nights and they were absolutely wonderful to us! We had booked a stay at a different hotel that turned out to be AWFUL. The staff was very friendly and accomodated us by offering one of the apartment style rooms for the double bed room price. We absolutely loved it so much that upon visiting this year, we wouldn't have thought twice about staying anywhere else. The same family of four that had stayed there one year ago was going back and wanted to stay again. My dad contacted the hotel directly via e-mail saying how wonderful it was and even requested the same room for his family of four we had previously (told the entire story). They had responded telling us it was no problem, confirmed the reservation w/ a credit card number, no sweat. Upon arriving in A'dam after the long flight at 7:30 a.m. the reception staff informed us that our reservation was for one person and that there's no way a family of four can stay in the apartments. They woudln't listen to any of what we had to say (though we had been there and stayed there, as a family of four less than a year ago). They told us they've never let a family of four stay in their apartments. They then proceeded to talk very in a very rude tone to each other about us.What's worse is they wouldn't give us our money back! They only offered two double rooms (TWICE the amount of money). After an hour of arguing with us, they finally agreed to refund our money and offered no help whatsoever in finding another place to stay.The only good part of this hotel is the concierge staff who were extremely helpful in recommending hotels and even offered their cellphone for us to use to find somewhere to stay.This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had and would highly recommend you find somewhere else to stay! It's not worth traveling that far to find out you don't have a place to stay!!

<Content>Excellent position- most unhelpfull staff ever known. This hotel is excellently situated on the river and close to Rembrandt Sq. The room was OK -stank from smoke though (seems only 1 floor is non-smoking). The big problem was the staff. At check in we were bumped down from a double room to a twin without being asked or told. We had a number of other problems that the staff just would not sort out and were in fact dismissive. Not the attitude expected from a hotel at this price (or any price). I will NOT return here.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised Didn't know what to expect as had read mixed reviews and got a budget deal on the Best Western website. We were very happy with the hotel and it looked like it had just been refurbished. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. The room was small but more than adequate (you don鈥檛 go on a city break to sit in the room all day). Nicely decorated with a clean modern en suit, LCD TV with cable, tea  coffee making facilities, hair dryer and the bed although 2 singles pushed together, was extremely comfortable. Location was excellent also, just off the Rembrandt square. We would definitely recommend this one to our friends.

<Content>Cheap and Cheerful After reading the reviews we were a bit nervous about this hotel however we had a fantastic time here. On our arrival we were greeted by a clean and modern looking hotel ( No sign saying Best Western so may have changed ownweship to Eden Group) . The roomn was ready from 3pm but they looked after our bags free of charge. The staff were helpful and courteous especially when we requested a kettle its seems you may need to ask for this. ( Small cups you may like to take your own) . As for the room, Small bathroom however water hot and excellent shower. We were on the 4th floor overlooking the park and it was quietish with the windows shut at night. The room although small boasted an interactive TV whicvh you could watch CNN news BBC1 / BBC2 and various local stations. For the money we paid it was excellent. If you come out of hotel and turn left there is an excellent Indonesion restaurant on the corner of the block and a nice pub few doors down. Take a number 9 from central station keep checking the stops and get out at Plantage Middenlaan. If you go past the zoo and two huge dinosaur statues on the left you have gone too far. Just a short walk from hotel is fantastic market Waterlooplein ( not open Sundays) We also highly recomend Pizza Cruise which was yummy and all drinks inclouded. There is a voucher with the canal bus. Make sure your hungry before boarding. Lastly we have to recomend the Electric Ladyland museum. Its not too easy to find costs 5 euros . 1st Museum of florescent art 2e Leliedwarsstraat 5 420-3776 . Nick who runs it took 7 years to create his cave in the basement. Hes a fabulous old American hippy ( no point getting there before 12am! He has created a facinating museum albeit very small ( one room) he loves his stuff and is well worth meeting. He also creates wonderful art which you can buy. Have fun we did!!

<Content>No problem with the room. This hotel is fine for a young couple on a modest budget. It was clean, comfortable and convenient. The hotel staff was not overly friendly, but they took care of all our requests. The room is small, but cozy, comfy bed and just fine for 2 ppl. The bathroom was TINY, but it kept us clean. The zoo is across the road and made for a nice half-day and there are a few little restaurants in the area. Honorable mention goes to Cafe Palorma, a inexpensive AND tasty Italian restaurant. Also check out the restaurant across from the zoo, it was great for breakfast.All in all, good hotel for the price, in a nice quiet area, tram stop right nearby.

<Content>Decent Place This hotel was okay. the location was great as it is a hop, skip and a jump from Rembrandt Square. Our room view consisted of a brick wall from the adjacent tower of the hotel. The hotel is in front of the many canals meandering through the city. Lots of restaraunts, coffee shops and tourist shopping nearby. All in all it was just a place to rest our heads while sight seeing Amsterdam. I would probably stay some place else the next time i visit though.

<Content>Better than expected! My experience at this hotel was much better than I expected. I had read a few bad reviews about this hotel before I went on holiday and I was expecting the worse but it was excellent. Nice welcoming reception, friendlyhelpful staff, clean, tidy room, powerful shower, good room facilities (hairdryer, t.v etc.) I would describe the room as a typical british travelodge room. nothing posh but standard. I would recommend any one staying here and I would feel confident returning to this hotel. It is also a great location - pretty central but not on a busy street and it is nice to walk outside the hotel straight onto a canal. We didn't have breakfast as we thought the price was pretty steep at 16 Euros and there were plenty of places around serving breakfast anyway.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Location Was recommended this hotel by hotelsrus after my choice was not available at that time. Great Hotel, clean lobby, friendly staff, great river view room, comfortable double bed, TV, Hairdryer, table, 2 chairs, shower over bath, wash basin and toilet. Clean!!!!! Buffet style breakfast was included in our stay which consisted of selection of cereals, toast, all kinds of preserves, English tea and various other variaties of herbal tea, scrambled egg, sausages, bacon, cheese, ham, fresh croissants, rolls etc etc. Great way to start the day before your sight seeing. Good location, within walking distance to centre although tram lines behind hotel approx 1 min walk. We walked miles getting lost in and out, up and down all the side streets. Shopping quite expensive except for usual souvenir type items, although if you explore as much as we did you are bound to find a bargain or two!! Would recommend to anyone. Would definitely return.

<Content>Good location, not fancy We stayed here for three nights, good location, close to things we wanted to see. One drawback is that there are a few nightclubs on the same street so you will hear some revelers if your room faces the street.We did not get the breakfast, as I recall it was 16 euros. Room was fine and clean.

<Content>Perfectly Adequate Stayed here for one night on a quick visit to Amsterdam. Right in the city centre, easy walking distance to all the sights and shops. Plus a tram stop on the corner if you didnt want to walk. The hotel itself isn't the ritz, but the beds are comfy and its pretty central. Perfect for a cheap and easy base.

<Content>Absolutey terrible this place looks good from the lobby but dont let that fool you the rooms are horrible, small uncomfortable and a twin is just a double cos the headboard has two side tables that cant be removed so you have to move the beds across the room and we paid 600 pounds for 5 nights for a twin and got this double room with two beds and to top it all off when we left 6 days after getting back from amsterdam the hotel had the audasity to charge us 35 pounds for cleaning charges even tho we cleaned the room are selves before we left to avoid any such charges but to no avail the just went ahead and took the money from my account DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS U WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF stay at the hotel prins hendrik opposit centraal station far better hotel never had a problem there. and also the hidden city tax is a killer when we got to the best western we were expecting to pay 748 euros but the tax had to be added when we left the added 37.50 eur and also asked us for a 1000 euro deposit i told em what they could do with that. i cant stress it enough DO NOT STAY HERE infact steer clear of the best western hotels completely.

<Content>Better than expected Well, we were also amongst those who were completely discouraged by the prior comments about the Best Westerd Eden Amsterdam Hotel on Tripadvisor. However, we have been positively suprised by the rooms  wc's which were big enough and clean. However, the lighting inside the room was poor and they could seriously do something about the sound insulation problem as it was clearly a minus.(though it was not so much disturbing as we thought it would be)On top of that the hotel was, yes, very central and the reception desk people did not give us any hard time. As there are thousands of cafes around in the city of Amsterdam, we preferred to skip the breakfast in the hotel.I'd say, one would not be so much dissapointed from a 3 Star hotel like B.Western Eden.

<Content>Great location, but not worth full price If you are on a budget, don't want the red light district and can get a room at a reduced rate, I paid 65 Euros a night, this is an okay choice. I would not pay full rate. Sure the rooms are small, but clean, and the breakfast is not worth the 15 Euros they charge, but you are staying in a great location on one of the main canals, 2 mins from the subway, and steps from Rembrantsplein. I got four different answers from four different staff about why wireless internet wouldn't work in the hotel until the concierge told me to use the network in the hotel next door.

<Content>A lilltle tierd Just returned from this staying at this hotel 9 - 12 Nov 06. After reading the reviews i was a little worried. The staff were friendly, the hotel could do with a bit of a makeover. However,the rooms were clean  the lobby toilets were the best i came across in Amsterdam. Hotel is in an ideal location for exploring the city. The price we paid seemed to be average for a three star, I certainly would not stay in less than a 3* there. They do a great breakfast at the Irish bar just behind the hotel in the square.

<Content>Great location, just a bit too small Having stayed in Best Western hotels before, we thought this would be the best option in a city that none of our party of four had visited before.And while it was alright, it wasn't exactly the greatest hotel. The location was fab, right on the edge of the Amstel and in the centre of the city - with all the places of interest within walking distance.But the rooms were the pokiest we had ever seen and the bathrooms just a joke. Of the two rooms we booked one had a bathroom not much bigger than an airline wc. The toilet actually faced a wall, and took a great deal of manouvering, along with knocked ankles and squashed knees - very similar to going to the toilet in a cupboard.The carpet in one room was very dirty and stained, and our friends using the other room had to bang the door open with their shoulder when the door stuck. The keycards never seemed to open the door the first time round, and had to be continuously swiped for the green light to come on.Downstairs there seemed to be an awful lot of wasted room, with a beautiful wooden reception area just wasted, in favour of a stark lit, white and red desk at the back of the hallway.Reasonable priced and if you're planning to stay out a lot (which you do in such a great city) it's a great place to stop. If you're after something a bit more plush, look elsewhere.

<Content>Not as bad as other reviewers made out Having read the other reviews on this website, I felt wary about being booked into the Eden hotel. I was expecting a filthy, noisy place with rude and arrogant staff. It may be the fact that my stay in Amsterdam was a competition win, and therefore I did not pay a penny for it, but I really did not find the Eden hotel that bad.Admittedly, we had to wait several times to be served at the check in desk as there were only ever 2 staff on, but they were friendly and always apologised for the delays. The concierge was also very helpful.The location of the hotel is fantastic - just around the corner from Rembrandtsplein, and a short walk to everywhere else. If walking is not your thing, the bus and tram stops are abundant and everything is easily accessible.Noise at the hotel was simply not an issue - this was probably because our room was on the inside of the building rather than overlooking the street. This meant our view from the window was of a brick wall - but I didn't go to Amsterdam to stare out of my window!The room could have been bigger, and the bathroom was just tiny! It meant a serious case of manoevuring around the toilet to get into the shower, but it was clean. The windows in the room would not open, which I found very odd, but the air conditioning unit worked so I don't suppose it mattered much. I had to request the tea and coffee making facilities, and the concierge brought me a tray with a kettle and plastic cups on, and they were a little stingy with the amount of coffee  tea provided. However they did produce more on request.Breakfast was plentiful - a large variety of breads, cheeses, meats, eggs, bacon, jams, cereals, fruit and yoghurt, as well as fruit juices, tea and coffee. The bar area, 'Garden of Eden' was also quite nice, overlooking the river, and the barman friendly.Overall, the hotel is in a good location, but is of average standard. If you are looking for somewhere more luxurious to relax in then Eden is not for you, but if it is simply somewhere to sleep and eat breakfast then go ahead as the location is brilliant.

<Content>Reasonable choice We have stayed in Best Western Eden Hotel for 4 days. My husband and I generally would like to stay in 3 stars hotels in city center. I can honestly say that this hotel was the best in this category among the ones that we have ever stayed . It in near the Amstel river. A room by the river side is possible if you are willing to pay an extra 20鈧? But I do not think that it is necessary because you will be full of river views during your vsit in Amsterdam. Our room was quite large with a table and another single bed. Do not expect a very new room with new furnitures but having a large room is satisfactory enough for me after dark and narrow room in Barcelona.The most beautiful thing was the breakfast. There is an amazing breakfast that you can enjoy. Plus the staff of the hotel are very friendly.I can recommend this hotel with contentment.

<Content>Book with caution On arrival, the reception staff hampered our check in at every turn. They queried our pre-payment claiming it was merely a deposit. Fortunately I had full documention which again they tried to query with other staff members. Snappy  argumentative would be an accurate description of a couple of reception staff. Avoid them like the plague. Future contacts were carefully chosen for advise  were much better. The room was average but cleanish, quiet  adequate but small. Fortunately we only spent one night here as any more could be challenging as far as space goes. If you are alone it would be adequate. Its well located, tv worked, porter was very helpful  our check-out lady was a dream by comparison to the initial experience. If you are able, try somewhere else - the staff are a little scarey when you're looking for comfort.

<Content>Good price and location but be very cautious.... Great location 5*! Looks OK from front door to reception but.... check-in and step through the swipe card door entry (required to operate lift also) and you step into a 1* establishment that smells and has threadbare carpets. The standard room we had booked was not ready by 4pm (should have been available from 3pm) and an alternative was offered. Room 307 (and I suspect others) was awful - 1* is generous. Our bathroom smelled of stale urine. We complained and were offered a superior room at no extra charge. Better - now 2* (it had a great view over the Amstel). BUT REMEMBER location is very good and price was fair if booked in adsvance - just don't expect 3*

<Content>I wanted to stand at the door of the hotel and warn people... I stayed here this past Friday and Saturday night as part of a girl's weekend, and I can honestly say in all my years of travelling, this hotel is the absolute worst.1. The room was (as already noted) was like staying in the Sahara and although a fan was supplied we woke up every morning completely dehydrated and exhausted. Our windows opened into the courtyard and could not be kept open throughout the night because of noise.2. The room was absolutely filthy. The sheets smelled of bleach, however covering the sheets were the dirtiest, most repulsive blankets I have ever seen. Despite removing them from the bed and sleeping only with the sheet (you didn't need blankets as the room was hot) I woke up both mornings covered in mysterious itchy bites. Bed bugs perhaps? 3. The customer service was curt, and unhelpful. When we asked for a different room (thinking the situation could improve?!) we were told there was no point.4. The hotel is amoung the nosiest I have ever encountered. The walls are paper thin and between the pulsating music coming through from the nearby dance clubs and people entering the hotel at all hours you really cannot get a decent night's sleep.If this entry makes one less person book at the hotel I will feel vindicated. Charging 140 Euros a night is nothing short of a sin.

<Content>Great location, very average hotel We stayed here for four nights and while the location, staff and breakfast were (mostly) fantastic, I think we'd look elsewhere next time if we were staying more than one night.Our room was large (by European standards) but incredibly hot. No air-con, just two stand-fans that we had to have on constantly. It really was like a sauna and it would be absolutely unbearable in summer.While we heard nothing from the street, we heard everything from inside the hotel because the walls are so thin and the doors don't close properly so all night and day you hear the constant banging of people trying to shut their doors or thundering down the stairs because the lift takes forever.Oh, and the lighting! I don't know if they were trying to save electricity or something, but our room was so dark. The light bulbs were obviously the lowest wattage, which made it really annoying if you wanted to read.The only way to get some natural light was to open the curtains which revealed the corridor to everyone else's room, so they could all watch you as well. Nice.

<Content>Good 3 star experience The Best Western Eden hotel on Amstel, is in my opinion a good hotel. The receptionist was polite, efficient and helpful. The same can be said of the concierge. Our double room was comfortable, clean and equipped with modern furnishings. It鈥檚 true that the rooms are not the largest, but this is Amsterdam, not The USA, and let鈥檚 face it, you don鈥檛 go to Amsterdam to stay in your hotel room!The Eden is in a good quiet location and an easy walk to Spui, Dam etc. If you take a tram from Centraal station, there鈥檚 a tram stop in Rembrandtplein. This is a short walk, but if you have more than 1 suitcase, it could present a minor challenge. We only had the one case on wheels so it was not a problem at all.At 150 Euro a night, you do pay a slight premium because of the location, but I think it was worth it. Take a peek in The Monopole as you pass, and you鈥檒l see why The Eden charges more!Both myself and my wife enjoyed our stay here, and would have no hesitation in making further bookings.

<Content>Would not go back I stayed in this hotel with my partner for his birthday back in March 2006. The hotel upon check in demanded that we pay for our stay up front and that we give a security deposit also!! This I found highly unusual as I worked for Best Western here in Dublin and have never requested a security deposit from anyone and have never asked for payment up front off of guests who originally booked by credit card! I was very insulted by this in all honesty. I queried the receptionist on this (who was very very rude) and was passed from Bill to Jack until finally told I had no choice but to pay everything deposit and all up front. Eventually when we got to our room it was damp musty and had no extras to speak of (no trouser press, kettle etc etc) we proceeded out to have a look around and did find a lovely square (Rembrandt) just beside the hotel (right as you walk out and right at the souvenir shop) here we found a lovely Irish bar (The gate) and some lovely cafes and restaurants. After a long flight and night I wanted a good night鈥檚 sleep but I didn鈥檛 get this as we were right beside the road and all I heard all night were cars music and noise in general. I requested a room change but was told the only room left was the one above ours which I knew would not have been much quieter. The bar closed at 1:30am which is very early for a residents bar. The hotel location is lovely being right on the canal but it is far away from the main train station and square. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend, not if I want to keep them that way!!!!!

<Content>Good location, but disappointing! My wife and I recently stayed at the Best Western Eden Hotel for 5 nights. On arrival (late in the evening) we checked and found our tiny room. The next day we asked to be moved to a non-smoking room - which happened after a night later. The room was on the third level but we were kept up with noise from the street below and low base from a local bar - don't stay in 308. After moving we were in a larger room. However this room had no natural light - it had a window - onto an internal courtyard, but the curtains didn't work properly either.The hotel did have a restaurant and bar on the ground floor. It no longer has a restaurant and all you can get (apparently) is pizza.We stayed and whilst it was not the worst, for the money it seemed below par and not brilliantly run.

<Content>Never again!!!! We, 3 friends of mine and i stay in the Eden for 3 Nights. We payed 鈧?140.00 per night: Dirty rooms, bad furniture, lights did not work, bathrooms had all time a bad smell. As we go to the reception to ask for a room change the women only say you can be happy that you have a room in Amsterdam, and we not like to move you in another rooms, that will be too much word for the maids! I am myself a worker in a Hotel but i were really shoked about the way they treat us and the other clients. As well i try to use the internet terminal of the hotel to buy a trin ticket for the deutsche bahn. i got a Internetpass by around Euro 10.00 as i acess to the internet, the deutshce bahn (train company) was blocked. A other worker of the Hotel say only this is not our problem as i ask to get my money back, bec. i can麓t use the internet for what i need, i got the answer you can surf in the internet, this is what you pay for!!!!!! We will never book again this Hotel

<Content>All bad reviews are true We had one week planning before coming to Amsterdam in the beginning of June. All hotels and apartments were booked and this place was the only option which was in the city center and decently priced, although still in the $100-200 range. We went with very low expectations and every single one of them was met. We laughed at the stained, cigarrete burnt carpet in our room. The whole in the wall where the telephone line outlet supposed to be mounted was histerical. The receptionist's comment What do you want, we are a 3-star hotel was very cute. We could hear all the party people coming back from the Rembrant's Plein at night. The location is great, but don't stay if you have other options.

<Content>Not a nice place at all. Not your normal Best Western I've read reviews before of people complaining about no air conditioning, and I thought, what's the big deal? It's Europe, it's not that bad. Well, let me tell you, it IS a BIG deal! If you are going here during the warm season, do yourself a big favor, and DON'T stay here. It is at least 10 degrees warmer in your room than outside. The fan they gave us didn't work. The room had window view of a block wall 5 ft away. We also had tons of flies in our room, and a few bugs in the bed. We didn't think they were bed bugs, but I'm not sure. If you want a nice hotel, try the Barbizon Palace. I stayed there last year and it is about 1000 times better than this hell hole. I will definitely not ever stay here again.One thing in their defense, is that the staff knew their hotel is really bad, and kept telling me that they're sorry, and that they will be completely remodeling everything this coming year.

<Content>Great Hotel - No Complaints We stayed here during the weekend of Gay Pride and the Amsterdam Football Tournament and had a great time. Given the number of guests on such a busy weekend the hotel could be forgiven for not being up to its usual standard. However, the hotel was clean and the reception staff were so polite and helpful. We arrived after a very early flight and left our bags in the luggage room until check in time at 3pm. The room (441) was ideal - spacious, clean, no noise whatsoever (in fact no room either side of us!!) - no complaints at all. After reading many grumbling reviews on here I was nervous about staying here to say the least but wouldn't hesitate to stay again. We have stayed in hotels all over the world and have seen the best and the worse - this rates up there with the best. The location is brilliant - 2 mins walk to Rembrantplein where there are bars/restuarants galore and the tram stop.to The Dam/Central Station etc. The canal runs outside too so very pretty - especially in the summertime. There is a boat trip available just to the left of the hotel for only 7 euros for an hour.My only grumble is that there was no tea/coffee making facilities but apparently they were available upon request. All in all a fab hotel in a perfect location.

<Content>A disappointment for the brand. I booked over the internet relying on the brand name of Best Western. I thought they would provide basic but good value accommodation.. I was sady disappointed. A small, shabby, cramped, dark room, without air-conditioning and not suitable for two guests. The wardrobe fell apart and the bathroom had no extractor fan so became extremely unpleasant to enter.

<Content>Rembrandtplein district hotel June 2006. I had an attractive modern room fronting on the canal. Unfortunately the air conditioing was not hooked up, and when the windows were opened, it was noisy and let in a lot of flies. Service was erratic --- often frustratingly slow at the reception desk, but a very good daytime concierge.

<Content>Great Location, clean hotel This being my second visit to the Eden Hotel, I have no complaints. Its not the ritz, but its clean, tidy and quite confortable. For the price, its brilliant. And the location is just perfect, your in walking distance to the main attractions. In terms of the hotel room, it was an average size, with air conditioning, the bathroom was big enough, everything was very clean and sure thats all you want.The only think I would have fault with, is the restaurnat, you'd be better off getting a meal up town instead of paying for their set menu, the starter is fab, the main course is poor and mean and the desert is only okay. Other that that, its great for the price.

<Content>Saved my life! My husband and I recently traveled to Amsterdam with our 2 adult children and booked a quad room via the internet at Hotel De Lantaerne. When we got to our room it was truly uninhabitable (nothing remotely resembling the on-line pics). We demanded our money back, as well as two other couples who had arrived at the same time. Using the internet in the lobby we all searched for new accomodations. My husband spoke with a rep at the Best Western Eden and she was extremely helpful in finding a room for us.Upon arriving, we were told the only space available for 4 people together was in their apartments next door but we would be charged the same rate as the rooms in the hotel. The apartment was extremely spacious with a good sized living room, full kitchen, dining area and bedroom. Everything was spotless and the location of the hotel cannot be beat. The weather was quite warm and they furnished us with a window fan. If you are traveling as a family, you can't beat it...there is so much space!I honestly don't think we could have found a better location, nicer accomodations or more helpful staff. The concierge was friendly and very helpful, as well as the desk people. The breakfast was overpriced, but with our own kitchen, we could prepare our own and enjoy the beautiful view as we ate.Awesome place to enjoy an awesome city!

<Content>Fine, but just don't get an overflow room After a night in a truly awful hotel we saught refuge at Hotel Eden. We had walked past it and had stayed at Best Western's before. They were almost sold out, but did have a room (room #117) that they offered us for $200 a night in US dollars. We assumed it would be one of their standard rooms. We got to the room and it turned out that it was an overflow room (this was later confirmed by hotel staff). It was very tired and the window overlooked a brick wall. The bathroom was better than our last hotel, but our toliet smelled like sewer and that was truly disgusting. We had to brush our teeth outside the bathroom because of the smell. We had to hold our breath while using the toliet. We didn't tell the staff about it until checking out..which was dumb because they might have been able to rectify the problem. The size of the room was fine and it was clean (most important to me). It was just tired and looked like it hadn't been updated in 10 years. The wing we were in (rooms in the 100's) were the overflow rooms so I guess that was to be expected. However we felt like we should have been told that when checking in. Breakfast was not included, and we felt like we should be getting more for $200 a night.The location was fantastic however. Right around the corner from Remblantsplein, and a very easy walk to everything else in the city. The canal that the hotel sits on is very pretty and if we had a room overlooking the canal vs. a brick wall we probably would have felt much different about the room and not minded that it was tired. The staff was nice, and we asked the conceirge for advice on what canal tour to do. The location of all the Remblantspelin restaurants 1 minute away was nice. I would stay here again if I was assured that I wasn't going to have an overflow room in the overflow wing.

The rooms were small and were not updated but were clean. The bathrooms were large, clean with unusually hot water (be careful !!). The hotel was well located. The staff was accommodating and informative. We would stay there again.

<Content>Great location shame about the rest! Arrived to a room with a very small window, impossible to read a book even WITH THE LIGHTS ON! Asked for a change, which was given readily, helpful staff at Reception. New room was through a rabbit warren of corridors, looking out onto some side street, but looked ok, went out for the evening. Returned at 1.00am to a VERY NOISY queue of clubbers queueing in the street under my bedroom window. Boom boom garage/techno music coming through walls. Asked for another change of room which was given after quite a long wait, onto the canal at the front (supposed to be superior rooms - yeah, right! NOT.) All bedrooms VERY basic, but clean. Bathrooms clean but tiny.Would NOT stay there again due to noise/disturbance problems, but the location was very handy for the flower market, Rembrandt museum, opera house., etc. Didn't know it was in the gay district, before we stayed, but wouldn't have any complaints about that anyway.

<Author>Savvy-tourist
<Content>A 2* minus hotel, very basic I've been in Eden Hotel-Amsterdam twice recently. It's a 2* minus hotel with no doubts.Trip from Airport to Eden Hotel: Go to Tourist Information desk in the airport. They will sell you a return ticket for the shuttle bus for about 20 Euro. (The taxi would cost you about 70 Euro). Talk to the girl to the desk. The guy is not so amiable. (he did not tell me that at the return trip the shuttle bus does not leave from Eden hotel but instead 300 m away from Schiller hotel). Disadvantage of shuttle bus: the driver waits to fill the minibus up to 30', you might have the chance to drop you the last one and the trip takes almost one hour after leaving the airport if the minibus is full. Advantage: price and you get a tour of the city that would not be possible by taxi.Arriving at the hotel: location is great, the view splendid over the canal in left. In right a new building spoils the view. The front desk did not want to help me to confirm the minibus for next morning. Told me is not their job ?! Very strange and frustrating. I asked a room with view over the canal and charged me 20 Euro extra over what already paid. The hotel is actually composed by several buildings built over centuries. With different styles. Probably the front building is a historic one. Access the higher floors by elevator only with the room's card ?! If you have a large family you can not leave anybody behind, they would not reach the room anymore. The room: 3rd floor with street view had very refurbished with old furniture (like from flea market) from 7 different styles. Colors: everywhere brown. Carpet looked worn completely. On the wall above the bed a big glass 2x1.5 m painted with some tulips?! Looked very dangerous, (would fall in the bed and cut you bad) for sure, no place to sleep with naughty kids or a young couple鈥?Bathroom looked old, faucets worn and old.Room very noisy in general, very bad insulated to the high traffic on the front cobblestone street. Also noise from the hallway present in the room. Could also hear what the neighbors from the next room where talking. At night, perfectly audible the people talking in the street. Second time I asked an inner room. Very small and a tiny window. Quiet, though. Restaurant and bar correct. The menu list very short but the salmon and the steak were good. Staff friendly. The breakfast room another story. You have to walk in another building through inner hallways with cardboard walls. The furniture completely worn out, and the sofa, oh God, do not touch. They are so dirty like they worked a railway station for 20 years. Breakfast was included but if you have to pay for it does not worth the money. Very basic. One type of coffee, one of milk, 2 of cheese and ham, one of sausages. In the fake ceiling, through big holes from the work could see cables and pipes. Also behind the fake walls could hear drilling machines working and so on. Disappointing. Back, in the lobby (reasonably refurbished) a computer with the internet access. Working.Conclusion: is for you if you are a student or on a very tight budget. Otherwise avoid. I would not go there ever again. Sorry!

<Content>Don't be put off by other reviews Although our room was VERY basic but it was clean - we were more than happy with the reception, bar and staff who were extremely friendly and helpful, making us feel very welcome. The breakfast was very good - unlimited buffet style  plenty of choice continental style with cold meats and cheeses  also scrambled eggs  bacon or sausages. Great location - the square behind the hotel had a great choice of bars and resturants - the Australian bar had a great menu and happy hour for cocktails. Enjoy your stay - we would be happy to return there - just don't expect too much from your room.

<Content>Worst Western Eden Hotel !!! Me and my fiance spent 3 nights at this dreadful hotel in Feb 2006, it was our first visit to Amsterdam and meant to be a break with a difference away from the children..... A DIFFERENCE IS WHAT WE GOT!!!!Amsterdam itself was lovely, a great experience if you've never been and i'd highly recommend it, as for the hotel.. where do i start?? The first room we were allocated had a view of a brick wall and was so dark with the lights off my fiance ALMOST looked like Brad Pitt, it was damp and the smell was horendous. On my request my fiance went back to reception to request a different room which i later found out cost us an additional 30euros PER NIGHT... if this was an upgrade god help the other rooms. We did have a canal view with windows but you had to be on your knees to see out of them. The bathroom was probably about the best thing in the room, the bed was ok but the sheets  covers looked horrible... also if you like your sleep don't expect to get much, we heard ALL of our neighbours antics from bedroom to toilet the walls were that thin!!!!We are not a couple to complain but this hotel definatley does not score in our books!!DEFINATLEY NOT A 3* HOTEL THIS WAS THE PITTS!!!

<Content>better than expected On the day of leaving for this hotel I read some horrendous reviews on this site and found previous visitors recommending not to stay there! This caused our party to expect the worst when arriving late in the evening. However, the staff on arrival were helpful and pleasant. The rooms average, but were clean with the bedlinen white and crisp. It was cleaned every day to the expected standard. Our room was at the rear of the hotel which we later found looks down onto the doorway of a night club, which opens late in the evening, however the double glazing keeps out most of the noise. Make sure you close the windows properly as when we didnt, it came open at about 3am and the room was shaking!!! Never saw any mice in the restaurant and the breakfast was great. Excellent location and the hotel helped to make our stay so enjoyable.

<Content>EXcellent Hotel This was my first visit to AMS,but not to Europe,so am aware of ratings.This hotel was clean,the staff was more than helpful.The location can not be beat.The hallways looked a bit well used but our room which overlooked the canal was up todate and a good size for a 3star European hotel.I hope when they open up their new place around the corner ,they keep this as the view is fantastic,we booked this several months in advance and had a good rate from BW and we had to pay 20euro extra for the view but for us its worth it. We did not eat at the restaurant but the staff suggested nearby restaurants which were excellent.The bar staff very kindly opened our self bought wine bottles which we consumed in our room and in fact told us where to buy them and beer which the beer, at least they sold in vending machines but suggested we but it elsewhere for less.All in all a great hotel

<Content>Great value for money  I stayed here 2 years ago and whilst I knew that the rooms can be shabby, due to the location and an excellent deal at $70 per night (inl breakfast) I thought it was worth the money. We seem to have lucked out though and got a far superior room to the one we had before (or they've just decorated!)and the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.If you want an average 3* which is definitely a hotel and not a hostel, I would recommend and stay here again.

<Content>skip this place This was my 2nd stay at this hotel. I also stayed here Dec. 2003. In two years this place fell apart. They are building a new hotel that will face the square. They had banners that said it was to be completed in 2005 but it was far from being done. Our room for 3 people was worn out with bleach stains and holes in the carpeting. It was so dirty that we couldn't take off our shoes. The construction pounding went on all day. The walls are paper thin and we heard all the activities of the young couple next door. Didn't get much sleep that night! The breakfast went down hill too. We paid $125 usd so the price was good for Amsterdam but I wouldn't stay there again. I like the location. There are a few other hotels in the same square I will try next visit. Loved Amsterdam!

<Content>Basic Accomodation, Great Location I paid $75 a night, and could not have been happier with the location or the staff of the Best Western Eden, Amsterdam. This hotel is in walking distance to the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, the Anne Frank House, the train station (with light luggage). The staff was lovely and never hesitated to help with directions or general questions. After reading the many reviews about this hotel (complaints about the noise, the shabby carpet, the club next door), I was truly afraid of what I might find after booking the hotel. However, it was simply a basic room in need of a makeover, perfect and reasonably priced for the traveler who doesn't plan on staying in a hotel room all day. Sheets, towels, and bathroom were all clean.

<Content>Not so mice!!! My partner,sister and myself arrived at the BEST WESTERN Amsterdam on the 16th dec, first impressions we thought it looked well maintained as we arrived into the lobby, found the receptionists friendly. But as we got out of the lift to find our room, we noticed it seemed quite shabby in the corrider on route to the rooms.Our room was very basic and in need of decoration ripped carpet, wallpaper e.t.c.We were disgusted with the restaurant, we were enjoying our meals tilL we seen a couple of mice running out of the kitchen, my partner complained and was told this was normal and all the hotels were the same in Amsterdam, we were told as soon as food falls on the floor the mice were there and there was nothing they could do about it.In there favour we did not pay for our meals that evening, as we could not eat them!I would not stay here again as i don't like sharing with rodents!

<Content>Great service My husband and I stayed at the Eden Hotel in late November. We arrived early and went to the hotel at 7 am. Although check-in time was not until that afternoon, because the hotel was not full, they allowed us to check in immediately. After a long night of traveling, it was wonderful to be able to rest and refresh (and drop off our luggage). The location is excellent - walking distance to everything. This was our 2nd stay at the Eden - it is a clean, standard hotel but the location is great and price is reasonable.

<Content>Worst Best Western? Initial impressions of this hotel from the canal or foyer are quite good. However we had a generally bad experience overall. The rooms are pretty shabby. Check-in did not register our extra night so on our last day they emptied our rooms. My colleage's stuff was saved i ntheir safe as he had his passport in there. Mine was all destroyed as far as I know! The person at the front desk was rude and did not even appologise. Thanksfully the manager did! But on all calling their staff involved their answer was just your room was empty.Needless to say I do not recommend this hotel to anyone except lawyers or detectives who may wish to test some of their skills - or people who teach front-desk staff how to behave properly.

<Content>Poor Eden This is one of the worst 3star hotels I have ever stayed in. Wallpaper falling off , no tea and coffee unless specifically asked for, and then not refreshed the following day. Toilets and bathrooms so small that if you are on the loo you can't shut door. Towells so thin you could almost see through. The ceiling outside my friends room falling down. When we complained had to pay 20E to upgrade to a room that was little better. At least it was clean. Never up to 3star standard. Although charged at 3 star rate. Will not return.

<Content>Great location but a very basic three star! The Eden is located in a lovely part of Amsterdam and the staff are friendly. However it was one of the most basic three stars I have stayed in. Small room (with tiny bathroom) overlooked a brick wall. The beds weren't made properly and the corridors really stank of smoke (there is one non-smoking floor). Also, as previous reviewer mentioned, the sound proofing is very poor - I could here the man next door coughing all night and the squeals of the girls down the corridors coming in late from clubbing. Not a place to get a good nights sleep!

<Content>No complaints Spent two nights here last weekend. We knew nothing about the hotel previously to arriving as we were bumped from another hotel owned by the same chain. We found the hotel totally adequate for our needs. It is in a very convenient location (2 mins walk from Rembrandtsplein), the communal areas (reception etc) are smart, our room was quite big and was clean. The main downside is the noise - internal sound proofing appeared non-existent so you may know more than you wish to about what your neighbours are up to.Also street noise during the night.However for the price we would definitely consider staying here again.

<Content>Great location I just spent a week at the hotel. I was attending two conferences, and the hotel was one of the conferences' choices, thus I paid less than the usual price. The room (a single room) was at the back of the hotel, it is very small, with a small window that opens to the wall of a corridor (from this corridor one can see what is going on in the room unless the curtain is drawn), so there is hardly any air in it. It was warm in Amsterdam and I needed a fan, lucky for me there was a fan in the room, probably left there by the previous occupant. The room was clean, and so was the sheets and the towels. Breakfast was not included, and as the price of it is outrageous, I did not eat breakfast at the hotel. I think that at the regular price of this hotel one can get a better one. I found the reception staff not friendly at all, uncooperative and unhelpful. The hotel has one advantage, its location on the Amstel river, opposite the Town Hall and the Opera, near Rembrandt Plein and in walking distance for most of the sites.

<Content>Conventient Hotel I had a very spacious room (although with no view at all), and although another part is currently being added to the hotel I had no problems regarding noise of the ongoing construction. The room was clean, well appointed, the breakfast buffet was copious and of good quality. The lobby is nothing to write home about, internet access absurdly overpriced, and very innocent web-sites (like the timetables of the Belgian and German Railways) are banned! Very friendly staff. Great location for everything remotely interesting in Amsterdam, and, if you don't pay the rack rate, good value.

<Content>a far cry from what i was led to expect first of all, the tiny two windows of the room overlooked the roof of the next building and offered us quite a look into its tennants' rooms (those living on lower floors).the radiator was adapted to summer time and thus didn't work to its full capacity.we requested to be given an additional heater (we came on a very rainy and cold day which is not unusual at all for the climate in holland) and the heater was brought to our room two days after we requested it and only after a few calls to the reception desk.breakfast was very poor and dull, the same kind of foods greeted us almost every morning, there was no kind of vegetables at all.one evening we returned to the room and were amazed to see that all wastebins hadn't been emptied. when we called reception and let them know, we were told that the maid probably forgot to empty the bins. unbelievable !we also noticed that some of the sheets had yellowish stains on them.there was no sugar or coffee available in the room.on top of everything, upon leaving the hotel' we asked the concierge to order us a taxi that will take us to the airport. he promptly did so while stating that taxi fare ranges from 35 to 40 euro and strongly suggested we should not pay a cent more.when we got to the airport, the taxi driver said that we owed him 51.90 euros and came up with a strange explanation about different taxi companies each charging its own fare.we were left with a strong feeling of being cheated both by the concierge and the taxi driver who most probably struck a deal between themselves to make a profit from us foreigners.and i haven't mentioned the noise that could be heard from the music that was being played almost all night long in the pubs that surround the hotel.and to think that we paid 1000 euros for spending 7 nights at this hotel is truly enraging.we didn't get our money's worth. simply outrageous.all this being said, i strongly recommend you stay away from this hotel.

<Content>Beware of Building works The hotel is undergoing substanial building works and its noisy from 7am in the morning. There is also works going on outside in the street that will be present for a while. Our room was small and tired, it also has a few minor irritating faults. No Tea/Coffee making (unless specifically requested and then you had to balance it on a foldup chair). A shortage of plugs, to name a few.The public area's were pleaseant and the Breakfast was good value.The Hotel is well posistioned, with good transport connections. However, I would tend NOT to use this hotel until ALL the building works are complete and the rooms have been brought up to a better standard.

<Content>***Enjoy the Eden...!!!*** Me and my friend (21  21) just returned fom the eden last week and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Althought the room was not 'great' it was what we paid for. We were in room 111. The view was not great...we looked onto another building directly with about 1 meters gap between the 2!!! but the bed, bathroom (hairdryer, tissues!!) etc was just what we wanted. Loved the free safe in the room, great for peace of mind when out and about in the dam. Noise levels as mentioned in other reports was annoying. On are last morning after a heavy night out noise noise noise was all we could hear but it is a busy hotel so fair enough. Check in time was a killer!!! 3 in the afternoon!! We'd been up since 6 so when we was told by the reception staff our room was not ready we were not impressed!!! This was soon sorted and we were given our room. Just around the corner is the rembrant plein. A really nice area with lots or bars, restauants and a tram stop right there 2 get to central station or dam square. 'Smokeys' coffee shop is great for a smoke, we met lots of Australians  Amercians in there who were a great laugh. We did find tho that drinks in Amsterdam were very expensive...on our first nite we decided to get a double Vodka redbull each...came to 20 euros for the 2!!!! soon went onto bottles like Smirnoff ice which wud vary between 4-6 euros each. Party Crew Cafe also in the square is a great laugh if u want a dance etc. On the Thursday we went to a club called Escape in the square...although absoulty gorgous inside, the music was all foreign dance so not my scene. A great Irish bar in rembrant plein also (cant remember the name) but they did a gorgeous English Brekky (10.50 euros). Overall i found Amsterdam a great place and the Eden is a great place 2 stay and would receommend...enjoy the dam :-)x

<Content>Average Best Western Eden Hotel I would recommend this hotel for travellers who won't be staying the room for long periods of time. It is centrally located on the Amstel canal and restaurants. The rooms are well-sized for Europe, but paperthin walls. The occupants next door could be heard well into the night. If the lift is broken, like it was on the night we stayed, it can be difficult to locate the other two on the floor.

<Content>Very basic hotel for good price. My husband and I stayed at this hotel at the end of May. They were apparently having unseasonably warm weather in Amsterdam the two days that we were in town, and it was unfortunate that the window in our hotel room only opened a couple of inches. The room location was on the side of the building and faced other buildings with balconies, and at night, and into the early morning, people would sit on the balconies and talk rather loudly. As if the heat didn't make it difficult to sleep, the constant voices was very distracting. (Try to request a room in the front of the hotel, if possible.) However, this hotel is in a very convenient location. A very short walk to the Rembrandtplein tram stop and within walking distance of many restaurants and bars. The room is very basic, but if you're not too picky, the price is right. We didn't spend much time in the room anyway so it wasn't that big a deal. The bathroom was clean and modern. The staff was fairly helpful. Overall, not a terrible experience, and if it weren't so hot, which isn't normal anyway, it would probably have been very enjoyable.If you plan to get a museum pass when you arrive, there is a place in the Central Station that sells them. I recommend buying it there rather than the tourist office across from Central Station. Much shorter line and less chaotic. Also, to get to this hotel, take tram 4 or 9 from Central Station. It will drop you at Rembrandtplein and then you just need to duck through the alley (towards the canal) in front of the tram stop to get to the hotel. Once facing the canal, go right. The hotel is just a few buildings down.

<Content>Prison cell at Eden Hotel Three women friends and I stayed at the Best Western Eden Hotel for three days at the end of April 2005. Our rooms had all the charm of a prison cell. The carpet was stained, the bathroom tile grout was dirty and the formica table top was chipped. The complex system of elevators and labyrinth of hallways was very confusing. The only good thing I can say is that the bed was okay. We were there during the Queen's Day celebration, and the music was so loud that we did not sleep at all that night. Even my friend with the major earplugs couldn't sleep. It sounded like we had loud speakers in our rooms. The best thing I can say about this hotel was that it was inexpensive compared to other Amsterdam hotels. At 110 euros per night, it was still a bad deal. And the pictures looked great on line! I would not ever stay here again, and am writing Best Western to complain.

<Content>lovely, just what you need if you are looking to stay somewhere pleasant but not too posh then this place is in a great location and not badly priced. we asked for a room with a view over the canal and it had great large windows for us to look out of.brekkie was nice and the bar at the front of the hotel was a nice atmosphere. For most people going to amsterdam, this place would be entirely suitable and in a great location. (quiet, just off rembrantsplain) if your looking for a plush pad, then go somewhere else.

<Content>Pretty Darn Good! My boyfriend and I stayed in Amsterdam for 3 days. The location is great...outdoor bars, nightclubs, and of course coffee shops are just around the corner. The hotel is situated right in front of cool canal, and a beautiful bridge. The hotel staff was VERY friendly. Our room was clean, the bathroom big, (watch out, the water in Holland heats up really fast!! You'll burn your face off if your're not careful!!!). It was very noisy outside, and a train station was nearby, but the windows were pretty thick...so we were not bothered at all. You get what you pay for...if you're on a budget, but can afford to stay in something better than a hostel...this is a GREAT deal. Overall, I would give this hotel an A-. Have fun in Amsterdam!! :)

<Content>This place is great! Let me first say that we got our room at the Best Western Eden for 60 euros a night. When it comes to hotels, obviously the price will color your opinion. If this was 200 euros a night for the same hotel, I wouldn't be raving about it. But the Web Special on (---) gave us 60/night.This is a great place. The lobby is nice and the staff is very welcoming, which is a pleasant way to start a stay. My girlfriend bought some flowers the first day and she asked for a vase - we had barely shut the door to our room when someone knocked with a vase for her flowers. The room was decent sized, clean, the bathroom was spotless with a very warm, very strong shower. The TV carried CNN and BBC. The morning breakfast is large with eggs, cereal, various breads, juices and yogurt. Very filling and a pleasant surprise. The location is fantastic.Yes, our queen bed was two singles together ... not a huge deal in my book. This is a great hotel and a great value. I didn't notice any excessive noise or have any other notable issues. Your mileage (of course) may vary during your stay, but I can very heartily recommend this hotel.

<Content>A Decent Place To Sleep  If you just need a reasonably priced room to stay in overnight - nothing more, this hotel may be for you. It is in a good location only about 2 blocks from Rembrantplein. My room was 80 Euros per night and to say the room was plain would be a big understatement...a double bed, a window with no view, a room safe, a TV, and a bathroom....but that's all I needed. The lobby was attractive and the staff was helpful. The only negatives were that there was a nose tissue (unused) lying on the floor of my room beside the bed when I checked in and the hotel has an 11:00AM check-out time. I requested a late check-out of 1:00PM as I had a later flight out, but the night desk clerk would only extend my check-out until Noon (which I consider normal check-out time). The next day, at 12:05PM, they phoned me in the room to ask if I was leaving....geez! Given that this was only an overnight stay for me between flights, I would stay here again under the same conditions. If you're on your honeymoon, or want to impress someone, I would recommend you find another hotel.

<Content>Great location A friend and I stayed at this hotel for a week. After the initial disappointment at the 'twin' beds in the twin room being right next to each other like a double (a Dutch thing we were told) it turned out fine. THis hotel is not the best I've stayed at but the location for us was perfect. Pleasant enough hotel, clean small rooms - no tea or coffee facilities but they don't advertise this as part of the facilities. Staff (concierge) very helpful.

<Content>Nice place to stay Just spent 2 night at the BW Eden. The best part of my stay at the hotel was probably its location. We could easily walk to most of the major attractions of the city. We were first given a room that had no view except for the brick wall of the building next door. After negotiating with the friendly staff working at the front desk we were upgraded to a bigger room with nice furniture. Best of all, the room had a direct view of the Amstel River. Breakfast, which was included in the price, was a nice way to start the day. I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Very Satisfactory We have recently returned from a mini break in Amsterdam. We booked a family room (Double and single beds) through the Ryanair Hotel website for 拢66 per night including breakfast. We were located on the back of the hotel overlooking a lovely garden. The room was clean , spacious and comfortable. There was a TV in the room which had BBC1 and BBC2 on it but no mini bar or tea making facilities. The staff were friendly and very helpful. We ate in the restaurant on the first night and found it very reasonable - 3 course meal 24 Euros. The bar was small but friendly. There is an Irish bar a few doors away which has live music and is very friendly. Canal boats stop directly opposite the hotel and the hotel is within walking distance of other attractions, bars, restaurants, shopping area and floating flower market. We had a lovely walk back from the Anne Frank House. We took a taxi from the hotel to central station (10 Euros) and then we got the train to the airport (3.40 Euros). All in all I would recommend the hotel and we would use it again.

<Content>Not what we expected from a 3-star hotel! First off, let me preface this by saying that my husband and I are originally from the States, but have lived in Germany for the past 2 1/2 years. We've done our fair share of travel in Europe, so we are well-aware of the differences in standards between European and American hotels. That being said, comparing the Eden to other hotels we've stayed at throughout Europe, this was NOT a 3-star hotel, as advertised. We stayed there this past August for 3 nights, along with another couple. We chose to drive there, and when we arrived at the hotel, we were surprised to find that there was no on-premises parking, as their website had advertised outdoor parking available for a nominal fee. Instead, we attempted to pull up outside briefly while I ran in to inquire about where we could park. The staff practically yelled at us that we must move our car immediately, and cannot sit outside even for a moment to unload or ask directions. When I asked where we could park, they said Over there. and pointed across the canal. We then had to find our way to the public parking garage (NOT a private one for the hotel, as the site had led us to believe) and haul all our luggage across the canal.We had asked for non-smoking rooms, which we did not receive, nor did they have any more available when we asked to be moved. We had also requested air-conditioning, as the website advertised Air conditioning available. Well, that was a joke. I don't know if it was broken or what, but in both of our rooms, it didn't work at all. Not only that, but the windows in our room would not open at all, so we had to request a fan for some relief. Keep in mind that we live in Europe, so we're used to no A/C, but this was ridiculous - it was so terribly hot and muggy that the Belgian chocolates we had purchased on our drive up melted into a liquified mess within a few hours. When we complained to the hotel staff about the how the supposed A/C didn't work and our chocolates melted, they responded with total indifference.I have to agree with previous reviews as far as the quality of the rooms. They're adequate for sleeping, but definitely nothing special. Our floor seemed to slant slightly, the room reeked of smoke and mildew, and there were hairs in our bathtub and in the sink.The staff wasn't exactly friendly either - one evening, we returned late and I was trying to find the room key in my purse. No one was at the front counter, so I was sorting the contents of my purse there, looking for the key. I accidently rang the bell for service with my elbow, and was greeted by a man stepping out and asking What do you want? I apologized for the mistake, and he responded very rudely with, You see, that's what the bell's for. You ring it if you want service. That's how it works. He gave us a disgusted look before again disappearing from sight.I must say that the location was good though, so this hotel might be an okay choice if you're strictly looking for a place to sleep and shower. I wouldn't recommend paying over 100 euros a night though, it simply isn't worth it!

<Content>Good hotel for exploring amsterdam There seems to be a lot of moaning going on about this hotel, but I have just got back from staying there for 2 nights and thought it was really good for the price (we paid 锟斤拷锟斤拷锟斤拷69 per night). The location is great as it is near all the main bars etc. The staff where very friendly and the rooms where OK. The beds are very comfy and there was more than enough cupboard space. Yes there are no tea/coffee facilities, mini bar or air con, but it is only a 3 star hotel and these things don't bother a lot of people. We had a fair sized room on the side of the hotel where you could see some of the canal. Maybe this is why we where quite happy with it. Having stayed in barcelona a few times and seen the size of the rooms there that are like postage stamps, I was pleasantly surprised to find the Eden hotel provides rooms big enough to spread out. The decor and furniture are a bit dated, but its neutral and is not offensive.I didn't encounter any weird smells, stains or nightclub noise, so I cannot comment on them. Breakfast was filling and quite varied.Not a great full english, but if we wanted that we could have stayed at home. In summary its a good mid range hotel that does everything it should. I would stay here again!If you want luxury - find a five star hotel!

<Content>3***???? Maybe it was because we booked a triple room, but it was an odd 'L shaped' layout and the decor was was very dated. I'm not sure if we were facing 'Sinners' nightclub but it certainly wasn't a view of the canal. (The nightclub only operates Weds to Sun by the way, so this wasn't a problem noisewise). There was no fridge/mini bar and when we requested tea/coffee making facilites were presented with a tray of 3 plastic cups. I expected more from a hotel chain like this.

<Content>there is better Having being to Amsterdam several times, I can not recommend this hotel. I have stayed in much better and much more unique. After reading the tripadvisor reviews I complained when we were given a room right near the disco (with no air con). We were accomodated to be moved but had to pay the extra fee of course. Breakfast is alright especially if you are hungry. If staying a week or more, type in a search for apartments. We did this last summer and stayed in a fully furnished apartment for cheaper than staying at this run of the mill hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Location but nothing else. I picked this hotel because of the location, which I was happy with. There isn't much else to say about this place. The room we had was small, with old furniture, and looked out into an ugly alleyway. Strange smells came from parts of the lobby, (and it wasn't you know what), smelled like something rotten. Carpets everywhere were stained. You have to pay for internet access, and the staff was not particularly pleasant. In addition, the whole time we were there, busloads of tourists, some of whom didn't seem to use deodorant, were sitting in the lobby. Maybe that explains the rotten smell I talked about earlier. However, if you are looking for a convenient hotel and can deal with what I mentioned above, this place is okay. There is a great Irish bar and 2 or 3 coffehouses within a 2-3 minute walk from the hotel. We paid USD 100 for the room through best western hotels website, and that is about the limit you should ever consider paying. I have stayed at Best Westerns in the US and this one was a dissappointment. If they renovated this hotel, it could be fantastic. Right now, it is very down on its heels.

<Content>B.W. Eden Rip-off Great location. The hotel is at 144 Amstel corner of Wagenstraat. The Sinners night club on Wagenstraat will play loud music to keep you awake (even with the windows closed) until 3AM. Rooms that do not face Wagenstraat are ok, but not worth 170 euros per night.

<Content>we liked this hotel despite reading other reviews that somewhat slate this hotel we found it more than satisfactory. we got the room on a web special deal for 拢64 (double), breakfast not included. we did ask for non-smoking but got smoking rooms but they didn't smell. the concierge was very helpful and up for a laugh! the check-in desk staff could have been a little warmer. bar's ok but watch the prices i got overcharged. you can't knock the location, perfect and central, walking distance to eveything. rembrandt square on your doorstep so eating out ideal with much choice. recommend coco's outback, australian food and massive good value portions. would definetly go back and recommend if you want good standard rooms and central location.

<Content>Great location In a great location, 15 minute walk from Dam square and all the main shops, for those of you seeking the nightlife walk down the little side street at the side of the hotel and you will find a maze of bars and clubs.The hotel itself is clean and tidy with friendly staff; drink and food are on the pricey side.

<Content>what a complete dump, don't bother I frequently stay in Best Western hotels when on city breaks and so far the standards for 3 star hotels has been comfortable (given the amount of time that you actaully spend in the room) but I had the total displeasure of staying in the Eden.1. The guide photo is a con - they only show you half of the building and only the upper floors.2. The first room allocated had a window no bigger than 1 m x 0.5 m and the view was a brick wall, so no natural light. Wallpaper was pealing off the wall and nice big damp patch. Walked straight out.3. Second room was slightly better, but later found out that it over looked the entrance to a night club -so don't expect to get any sleep whatsoever considering they open at 1 and kick out at 5.4. Didn't get a no smoking room, so nice yellow tinge to the wallpaper and lovely smell.5. Checked out and spent the second night elsewhere.Save yourself the bother, this is not a 3 star hotel at all. Have stayed in better hostels. Total and utter dump.

<Content>The location makes this place First impressions of the reception area were this seems like a nice place. Upon check in I was allocated a double non-smoking room although on my booking i had requested a twin smoking room. The staff were happy to change it immediately but we were allocated a much smaller room with little natural light. By the way, it seems many of the reviewers got a cheaper deal than us which included breakfast. Shop around before booking as if you book directly with best western you pay 110 - 135 euros per night without breakfast. So much for being a gold crown club member. The bar and restaurant were fine. The fact that the bar stays open until 1am was a bonus as we could finish our night there. The staff here were very friendly and even gave us advice as to which nightspots to visit.The maids were another matter. They knock and immediately let themselves into your room. I didnt have time to shout hold on a minute before she was in there. On the final morning she didnt even knock. My modesty was spared as i was still in bed, but my friend was in a state of undress.But it is the location that made this hotel. I had noticed it on previous trips and decided that it would be a good base. The bars and restaurants in and around the Rembrandtplein and Thorbeckplein mean that you dont have to go far.

<Content>Great Location, Bad Breakfast! Location:Ok, I think all people here agree that this hotel has one of the best locations in Amsterdam. It's near the Rembrandtplein-Station which is easy to get to from the Central-Station...Hotel is really in the heart of Amsterdam so you can reach every point in Amsterdam very fast and easy from there. Location: 5 points! (1-5; 1=Terrible, 5=Excellent)Room: Well, we had a double-room and I think the most important thing is the bed of course... I was reading here that a few people had a double-room in Eden-Hotel and the bed was actually two single beds pushed together... can't tell you if that's true, but our bed was one piece ;-) It was very comfortable and big. Furniture....well well, listen: It's just basic, nothing special but I can't imagine people are complaining about it (ok, maybe we were blessed with a better room than others...but that's another thing). I was going to Amsterdam to enjoy the city and not to make a sight-seeing-tour in my hotel-room. So I'm not expecting a Louis XIV-Cupboard there. We wanted a comfortable bed, television, big cupboards for our stuff, hot water in the shower and of course everything to be clean...everybody who expects the same and not more will be satisfied.Room: Since it's a 3 Star-Hotel I give it 3.5 pointsStaff: Nothing to complain about, helpfull, friendly and well structured, the reception and entrance-hall are much more than you expect from a 3Star Hotel! A restaurant is integrated to the entrance-hall so you'll have a place to relax and drink a coffee after returning back to the hotel.Staff and General Structure of the Hotel: 4.5 pointsBreakfast:This is definitely the worst thing to say about the hotel. For 14 Euro/Person (!!!) you expect a selection of fresh food/drinks. Toast, buter, jam, cheese and all these standard-hotel-breakfast-offers were available...but absolutly no selection!! Orange-juice and hot chocolate-drink I was choosing at my first (and last!) breakfast were obviously just imported from a local chemical plant...baaaah, ugly, really. 14 Euro / Person....that means 28 Euro for me and my girlfriend!!! My urgent advice to all of you: Don't eat breakfast in the hotel except you are an undemanding person and like bad food. Just one more thing to add: Instead of eating in the Hotel we went to one of the many nice little restaurants very near to the hotel offering special breakfast-menus. We ate excellent fresh bread and had good beverages... for comparison: We paid around 13 Euro (!!!) for --both-- of us for this menus... Really, dear Eden-Managers, your breakfast is a jokeBreakfast: Minus 5 points! (Relax: the restaurant at the entrance seems to use a different kitchen...food and drinks there are allright ;-)Conclusion: I would go back to this hotel anytime but avoiding the breakfast-room as much as possible. Great location, great staff, plusminus good rooms...I enjoyed my stay there and in Amsterdam!Mike

<Content>Awful Hotel! We were dumped in this hotel at the beginning and end of a bike tour and I couldn't believe how bad it was! I've been in dorm rooms that were way more inviting. I'm astonished that anyone could like it and have to wonder if they've ever stayed in a nice hotel. The rooms we had were small, dingy and institutional looking. There was graffiti scratched into the elevators, stains on the room carpet and walls and the furniture was completely cheap and functional without even a hint of design. I'm amazed it rates 3 stars. The staff was friendly, but that didn't stop the place from desperately needing a renovation. Best Western should be ashamed.

<Content>I loved this hotel I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my girlfriend in January, and I loved it. Im hoping to go back to Amsterdam soon, and will be staying in this hotel again. The rooms were clean (double beds were a little weird - 2 singles pushed together!) Nice View, and quite close to Dam Square. Didnt spend much time in the hotel as there is so much to do in Amsterdam, and its so beautiful you dont want to be inside! Wasnt very keen on the breakfast, but thats down to personal choice. Can take breadcakes away so you have food during the day! (as long as they dont find out...) I liked the lobby and the staff were very friendly. Concierge was helpful. Overall, I think this was value for money, and I will be going back!

<Content>Terrible (May 2004) Looks are'nt everything! Do not be decieved as we were by their website. For a hotel that quotes non-smoking, its only on the 1st floor and god forbid you have to walk through the lobby to get there!!Rooms were very basic, plain, not even a hot pot let alone a small fridge. There were blood stains on the curtain sheers, and no shower mat. DO ASK FOR ONE! Shower heads are in the middle of the tub instead of on one end, standing space is very narrow and shower curtains are too long and hang into the tub... so of course my Mom proceeds to slip and fall out onto the tile floor. Very dangerous! and front desk was not sympathetic at all.Rates maybe a 2 star and the price of breakfast is not worth the 14Euros. Room itself was not worth the $115 euro per night at all!

<Content>Great location, bad hotel! I requested a non smoking room, and got one, but the hall way out my door stunk like smoke. The smell still got into my room. The mattress should have been replaced years ago. The whole room smelled like mold/smoke. Breakfast was disapointing. On the positive side, the staff was great and very helpful. The location was great, easy walking to attractions, or just checking out the local neighborhoods.

<Content>Loved it! We stayed at this hotel April 2004 and really enjoyed it. We found the staff very helpful. The room was quite big with a great view of the canal. However our friends also stayed here and were given a room on floor 1 and had a view of a wall. But thier room was nice and they also liked the hotel. It has a good location near all shops and not too far from central station. The bar was expensive (but so are most hotel bars), it had a really pleasant relaxing atmosphere which we enjoyed most nights. All in all we loved this hotel.

<Content>Worst Experience at a Hotel When I booked this hotel I read all the reviews and it seemed okay, but when we got to the hotel it was awful, the room was dirty diorty dirty, burn holes in the carpet, dirt on the walls, no closet at all, towels so thin they could be seen through, the non-smoking room was terribly smoky, the bathroom smelled like it had been cleaned with a dirty cloth, and the bed was the worst I have ever slept on.I expected small and that is what we got, but that wasn't an issue and the night club Sinners never bothered us (even with the window open) I just wasn't expecting the room to be in such disrepair - so unless you get a REALLY great rate (we paid 60 euro a night) look for a nicer place.

<Content>Satisfactory with a nice location This hotel, overlooking one of the canals, provides a lovely view from its front rooms. We had a smoking room on the 5th floor, which was satisfactory. The staff was polite and provided the expected services. The breakfast buffet was adequate and the dinner was better than we expected.

<Content>Excellent In the first week in February we had a 3 night stay at the Eden Hotel. This hotel had a fantastic location. Very freindly and efficient staff. Room overlooking the Amstel canal (River) (can be quite noisy with the early morning traffic 7-8am) Large spacious Rooms with en-suite. (No tea or coffee facilities) Good resteraunt and bar area. Secure luggage storage after check out, and excellent conseurge. The best hotel we have stayed in so far in by means of location and quality in Amsterdam, surely this is more than a 3-star?

<Content>Familyaffair - we have stayed here 3 times! Various members of the family have used this hotel for short breaks at different times of the year ad recommed it highly. It is extremely central and even if you dont want to walk, very close to tra stops as well. We occasionally had to wait a while for check-in or out but were very pleased with the facilities and helpfulness of the staff at all times. We wll return to it again!

<Content>Eden Hotel Apartments. My family and I have just come back from Amsterdam (children are 14 and 12 years old). We stayed at the Eden Hotel and I booked an apartment. We were on the top floor - no lift so beware. We had 4 flights of stairs to negotiate which were very steep. The apartment (no 884) was on 2 floors and facilities were good - crockery, cutlery, glasses, toaster, kettle, fridge, hob and sink in the kitchen area, bathroom, table and chairs, sofas, TV and two bedrooms. It is a 3 star so nothing to write home about but would recommend particularly for a family with older children. Location is good also - half way between Centraal Station and the Rijksmuseum. Canalbus stop just over the canal at City Hall. 5 minute walk to the main pedestrian shopping street Kalverstraat and just round the corner from Rembrandtplein which is good for restaurants and bars in the evening - cinema also. Would recommend but don't expect luxury.
