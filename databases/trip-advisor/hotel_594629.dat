<Content>Ideal location, great service! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were courteous and efficient. The rooms were spacious and clean. It is conveniently located near the Shinagawa JR Station. We had a beautiful view of the Japanese garden from our room. My only complaint is that the aircon did not seem to be working well so the room was quite warm so we had to open the window for cool air to come through. Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Exceeded expectations What a nice hotel. The lobby is spacious and clean. All the hotel employees are courteous and helpful. I never had to wait too long for an elevator (my pet peeve). You can see the Tokyo Tower from the elevator waiting area on the 9th floor. My hotel room overlooked the beautiful tea garden that connects this hotel with others. There is the sound of chirping birds coming from the hallway ceiling speakers in the morning. My room was spotless and roomier than I expected. The hotel provides thoughtful amenities - hot water for tea, bathroom toiletries, bidet, daily English newspaper. Linens are crisp and clean and water pressure is good. I saw a few Trip Advisor complaints about not being able to cool the rooms sufficiently. But especially after working a few days in my company's Japan office, where the temperature was quite a bit warmer, I can say honestly that I was satisfied with the room climate controls. I could also open my window for fresh air, which was nice.I took the breakfast buffet several days. There is a wide selection and the food was good. A little pricey but a good way to start your day when you don't know where or what you will be eating later on. I did some sightseeing over the weekend and it was a quick walk to the Shinagawa station. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>great location for transport links First of all, the room was big - Western size, clean and comfy. The view of downtown Tokyo we had from the 14th floor was amazing, esp at night.The hotel is 10 min on foot (or on the free shuttle) from the Shinagawa station, which has (1) a direct link (20 min) from the Haneda airport, (2) South-bound Shinkansen, with some services starting at Shinagawa, so you have more choice than at Tokyo stn, (3) Yamanote line - the strategic JR loop around Tokyo, (4) Tokyo metro. So, transport-wise you cannot be better off.Yet, the hotel is set in a quiet place with gardens (and more prince-branded hotels) around, so it's nice and peaceful.The service was great, with porters running out to meet us outside once they saw us dragging our bags.We were checking in in the morning, a couple of hours before the official checkin time. This was no problem, although initially they said our room was not available, but a more expensive suite was, so they offered to upgrade for 30 pounds a night extra. I don't know, if this was a trick or not, but as soon as we declined this, a room of the class we ordered was found.Free internet-connected PCs in the business centre near the reception is a plus.The cons:No wifi in the rooms. Even the paid-for ethernet connection did not work half the time. The 'no-service' token (1000yen cashback for not changing the bedding) can be used only at the hotel restaurants (not against any other services), which are quite overpriced and this will not even cover half a breakfast there.Location slightly uphill from the station.

<Content>Great location, nice and clean hotel Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa has a perfect location, near Shinagawa JR Station.The only problem is walking in August the climbing path from the station to the hotel, but being organised the hotel offers a shuttle transfer.I stayed there in a triple room for 2 nights. The room was quite big, clean and confortable. Not luxury but perfect as base for visiting the city.

<Content>Cheap and wonderful Tokyo option We were approaching our last night in Japan when our plans to stay with a friend fell through for the last night of our visit.From our Ryokan in Kyoto we searched Expedia for a hotel to stay in near Shinagawa station. We wanted something cheap, but nice. We found some cheap options farther out, some icky cheap options, and the Prince Takanawa Hotel. The price was right and it looked nice enough.We were pleased to find out that it was a 5 minute walk from Shinagawa station (the station we needed to get back to the airport the next day) and within walking distance of some great sites (what isn't a great site in Japan?). Note that there is a shuttle to the airport, I don't know the price though. We opted to keep it cheap and simple by taking the train there and using our subway pass. The front desk staff were superb. So helpful, and they held our luggage as we showed up before check out. They spoke perfect English and helped us out with all of our questions. I was surprised at how nice the room was. Spacious, clean, and there was a terry cloth robe and slippers waiting for us. The bathroom had the bidet type toilet and the amenities in the bathroom were nice. They included a toothbrush, comb, and razor (that razor was a life saver as I forgot to bring one). The bed was comfortable and we slept like babies. A great hotel for a great last night in Japan!

<Content>Ordinary accommodation My wife  I recently stayed for 4 nights on arriving at Tokyo  1 night on departing. On arrival, our pre-booked, pre-paid deluxe garden room had been allocated  no more were available. Accordingly, we were upgraded to a Junior Suite on the 14th floor with views of the Tokyo Tower and city area. Unfortunately, the room had an overpowering musty smell, the furnishings were old and well-used  the carpet had both holes  stains. As it was 11.30pm  we'd been travelling for 18 hours, we decided to sort out our accommodation the next morningWe requested  obtained a deluxe garden room on the 12th floor with views of the garden  the other 2 Prince hotels on site. While smaller, this room was much more modern and better furnished than our 'suite'. It was relatively spacious, containing 2 small armchairs as well as a writing desk  chair. There is a door to close off the bedroom from the entrance corridoor where the wardrobe, minibar, tea  coffee making facilities  refrigerator are located.The bathroom contained a bath  shower combined, bidet  was well-stocked with toiletries.The hotel is only a 10 minute walk (downhill) to Shinagawa Station  there are numerous restaurants, cafes, mini marts etc there  in the immediate vicinity of the New Takanawa Hotel on the other side of the common garden area. While the hotel operates a shuttle between the 2 Grand Prince Takanawa hotels  the Prince Hotel, it only runs of a morning  late afternoon.10 minutes walk in the other direction is the Takanawadai station, on the Asakusa Subway line, which goes directly to Asakusa Station for those wanting to visit the Asakusa Kannon temple complex  Nakamise Arcade to do some shopping.This subway line is also convenient for visiting the Edo Tokyo Museum - change to the JR Line at Asakusabashi station  travel 1 stop to Ryogoku station.All staff we dealt with were friendly  helpful  all had rudimentary English language skills with some being quite fluent.I can't comment on the restaurants as we didn't eat at the hotel.As others have mentioned, air conditioning seems to be a problem at this hotel. The thermostat in our first deluxe garden room could be set between 18  25C, but we were never able to get below 21C despite selecting 18C  running the fan on high. On the second day of our stay, we returned to find the air conditioner not working at all. I rang reception  spoke to 2 different people before someone from maintenance was sent up. He asked me to ring reception again, which I did,  after an animated conversation he passed the telephone back to me  I was advised that the air conditioning was shut-off every afternoon until 5.00pm because of the 'changing of the seasons'. It was 21C (approx 70F)  humid outside and 25C (approx 77F)  very warm in the room, so the maintenance officer obtained a fan for us.Bizarrely, the air conditioning came back on at 4.10pm  was on when we returned at 3.30pm the following day.On our second stay at the hotel (1 night in a different deluxe garden room), we were greeted at check-in with a sheet of paper advising us that all power - including that for air conditioning - would be turned off between 1.00  6.00am the next morning for maintenance. This room, however, was much cooler than the first despite being on the same floor  the same side of the building.Another surreal experience on our second stay was looking out our window and seeing all the fishponds in the garden empty  the fish apparently happily ensconced in the outdoor swimming pool.In our view, the hotel is conveniently located for travel within  beyond Tokyo but has little else to lift it above average in terms of an overall assessment.

<Content>Had a great experience in a traditional Japanese room This was our first hotel on a trip to Japan and it set a very high standard. We stayed in one of the traditional Japanese rooms with futons on tatami floors and it was beautifully appointed. This is a good way to accommodate a family of four. Probably the best service I ever had at any hotel, anywhere. After a late night of sightseeing the guy at the desk told us he'd like us to move to a larger room. The night staff''s English isn't as good as that of the daytime crew, so I couldn't figure out why they upgraded us. We found out later that housekeeping discovered a leaky faucet -- not acceptable to this outfit. We got a comp for a free drink in the lounge and when I went to use it, the woman at the bar dressed in a beautiful kimono presented it to me graciously, then slowly and respectfully bowed. Never had a gin and tonic like that before. It is a brief walk (they have a shuttle if you need it) to Shinegawa station, which gives you easy access to most of the top tourist areas on the Yamonote line (it is part of JR, so you can use the weekly pass on it as you would any other JR train). We also stayed at the Prince Hotel in Hiroshima and likewise had a great experience there, so this is probably a great hotel company. And the price was very reasonable. Highly recommended.

<Content>convenient hotel On a family trip to Tokyo we stayed at Takanawa Prince Hotel. I had stayed at the New Takanawa Prince Hotel 13 years ago. The location is great, a 5 minute walk to Shinagawa train station (JR line or Shinkansen) or a 5 min walk to Takanawadai TOEI subway station. I had to book two rooms for a family of four. The room was adequately sized for two people and was very clean and comfortable. We got a room on 14th floor with gorgeous views of Tokyo and Tokyo tower. There is a stunning garden on the hotel grounds with a koi pond, sakura trees and a Japanese maple tree. The staff speak English although repetition may be necessary to get the information required. The reservation desk helped us to make a tour reservation to Mt. Fuji and everything worked out well. The woman at the desk spoke English quite well and was ready with all of the information we needed. There is a business center on the lobby level with free internet access and printing at 105 yen per page. We also paid for internet access in our room at a standard 1000 yen per day fee. We ate at the Patio restaurant one evening. It is convenient, the food was acceptable. Prices are more than what you would pay outside the hotel, but then that is to be expected. The atmosphere is casual and it was a great place to go with kids after a long tour day. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel as a great place to stay.

<Content>Great hotel, improved service My wife and I stayed here for a week, and were impressed with the staff's enthusiasm and welcoming attitude. A short schlep from Shinagawa station, the hotel has nice gardens and a swimming pool. We got a great rate ($100) since the lobby was being renovated but it didn't bother us at all. Our 12th floor room was quiet and had a nice view. The room safe was big enough for a case of wine. The room was spacious, clean and modern, LCD TV, light console next to the bed and a minibar. Most of all we felt welcome and the staff was very helpful. There are many restuarants in the area close to the station.The only con is that the internet connection costs $15/day, but the Yahoo internet cafe has computers and connections included in the cost of a coffee (400yen). I've stayed in other Prince hotels in the past, but this one seems to have better service than the others across the street from Shinagawa station.

<Content>off the beaten path in Shinagawa booked a stay during the winter/spring season. This is a hotel complex with 3 Prince hotels forming a triangle of sorts. The Takanawa being the more senior of the 3, then the Sakura and New Takanawa. Backgrounder--Shinagawa is mostly a business district. The JR station there is probably the biggest in Tokyo, with a connection to the Shinkasen and Narita Express train. There are a number of hotels in the area, and Prince hotels seem to dominate (aside from the 3 Takanawa Prince's, there's also the Shinagawa Prince hotel right across the street from the JR station).On rooms: The Takanawa is the more traditional of the 3 in the complex. Rooms are average and decor is very 80's Japan. What's good about the hotel is the surrounding view--a traditional Japanese garden that sits in the center between the 3 hotels. There is a pool, which is not usable during the winter. A fitness center is located in the Sakura bldg, but there is an extra charge (similar to most hotels in Japan). With the complex sitting on a small hill, the hotel is away from the busy streets, and a walk up the hill to the hotel is quite serene. If your stay is during late march and early April, chances are you won't need to go anywhere else to enjoy a view of cherry blossoms in bloom. On our last night, I booked thru the Prince website a traditional Japanese suite, and that was the best part of our stay. It was like living in a movie set of a Japanese period film! huge bathroom with one room containing a toilet and bidet), and a separate room containing a traditional japanese bath (with wooden stool and bucket!).Breakfast at the hotel is not cheap, but I do recommend the Japanese breakfast if your package includes it. The other 2 hotels within the complex are more contemporary, but in a 80's kind of way. There's also a convention hall there which hosts events such as the Japanese Academy Awards... All in all, if you don't mind a rather quiet neighborhood with virtually no shopping after 8:30pm (except convenient stores), and a little bit away from Shinjuku or Ginza, Shinagawa is not a bad choice... Should you manage to get the Japanese suite in the Takanawa at a good price (less than US$280/night), I'd definitely recommend it.Almost forgot... You get a postcard view of Tokyo Tower from the Takanawa hotel.
