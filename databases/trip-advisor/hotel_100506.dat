<Content>If I was Austin Powers, the decor would be familiar, but that's about it. Hotel Seattlewhere the sheets have 3 different colors of hair.But that is okbecause they were clean on the second day.The bathroom made my friend cringe.She asked if I brought flip flops and sanitizer spray.The dirty shag carpet didn't stop at the wall.It crawled up at least another three inches.I'd give it one star,but I saw The Shining, and that was worse.

<Content>Great Location, but don't stay long We needed a place to stay in Seattle prior to catching an early morning Amtrak train to Portland. We looked around the train station but there is not much there. We were dropping our Hertz car off at the Hilton downtown and just wanted a place to spend the night. I called the Hotel Seattle based on it's location on tourist map near the Hilton. I didn't have access to internet to research any reviews, so did not see any until after our stay. The location is great, virtually next door to the high end hotels. It was half the price of the Hilton so we thought we would give it a try. When we checked in, I asked about a AAA discount, but the clerk's response was What's that?. That was the first time I ever heard of a hotel desk clerk (in US) not knowing what AAA was. Our room could have been used for a low budget movie's version of a run down hotel, threadbare carpets, dingy curtains not quite hanging right, minimal lighting (a strange hanging light in the middle of the room), dingy bathroom. Although it was definitely dingy, it did not appear obviously dirty. No a/c but luckily we didn't need it. The bed was not particularly comfortable, a little on the boucy side and with two people you both definitely gravitated to the middle. There was no clock in the room, but we did get the wake up call we requested.It was ok for spending the one night, I wouldn't want to spend more. On the positive side, it was a great safe location, quick taxi ride to train station, and the shower was great. They have not invested in low flow shower heads so the water pressure was really high. We also really enjoyed the conversation with the desk clerk the next morning. When I mentioned the clerk the previous night had never heard of AAA, he told us that clerk was a moron and that the owner must not have asked him anything but his name in the interview. He went on to say that we should check out the reviews on Trip Advisor, they were listed as one of the worst hotels in Seattle! You gotta love that type of enthusiastic employee! All in all, it worked for us for one night. But our friend the day clerk did mention that we had one of the nicer rooms! (I definitely don't want to see the not so nice ones!) Recommend you ask to see room before committing.

<Content>Great location. Horrible room  Hotel Seattle is right in the heart of downtown, and is perfect walking distance to anything. The room we stayed in was abominable. It smelled like a thrift store, the pillows and blankets were minute, the bathroom belonged to a truck stop. The tile in the floor was cracked, the vent sounded like a wind tunnel, there was mold in every crease and there was no liner to rank-smelling shower curtain. The staff was unfriendly. The cleaning staff's cart was parked infront of our room's door when we first arrived. The maid watched impassively as we put down our luggage and stuggled to move her cart without offering any assistance as we moved it aside to get into our room.It was a bed for the night near to Seattle's attractions, but that was it.

<Content>You get what you pay for I had read the reviews before I booked and knew what I was getting into. With that in mind, I wasn't surprised. In fact it was better than we expected. Yes, the rooms are outdated, the towels and floormat were thin, limited cable TV and an overall lack of amenities that one is use to in a US hotel. But as one reviewer said it is like a budget overseas hotel and I have stayed in several that were in similar condition and I just enjoyed the experience.  The check in and desk service was great. We asked for extra pillows from the maid and got them. We also spent $5 for flowers at Pike Street and they added character to the room.Location is everything. Our friends stayed at the Fairmont across the street and we stayed for 3 nights what one night cost them. My money went to dinners, trip to Victoria and baseball games.

<Content>It's a dump! Hotel Seattle is a seedy, overpriced dump. My wife and I spent three nights there in August 2008. The only real amenity was a color television. The bathroom exhaust vent was so loud we could barely hear the television when the bathroom door was open. The carpet was worn bare. The room had no air-conditioner. Although the first two nights there were pleasant with the windows open for a breeze in the room, the last night was extremely hot and uncomfortable due to a heat wave in Seattle. The hotel had no small fans available for use in our room. In addition, the hotel provided no ice. In fact, the front desk clerk told us we could have all the ice we wanted if we went down the street and bought it at a local convenience store. No hairdryer was provided either. Overall, our experience at this hotel was much less than desirable, especially since the room rate was higher than we usually pay for the usual amenities, i.e., air-conditioning, hair dryer, ice machine, mirror near beds, etc.

<Content>Complete Dump While tempting because of a nice, central location and price, unless you don't mind a hotel that has had no updating in over 30 years, including the disgusting orange 70's (used to be shag) carpet in the rooms - stay away!They did a fair job of keeping it clean, they only have so much to work with when the ownership obviously could care less about investing one penny in the property.The room smelled of things not to mention.If you keep the lights off, don't look in the corners, and wear your shoes while in your room at all times, you might be OK.No network available, so impossible for a business traveler. TV doesn't really work.

<Content>This Hotel Fit our Bill We stayed in Hotel Seattle for 2 nights and it was fine. It reminded me of the funky less expensive hotel rooms I found in Europe. There was some street parking available (the desk clerk pointed that out to us) during the week (don't know about how crowded it can be on the weekends). And there is a garage right up the street if there isn't any street parking.We were in Seattle for a wedding and wanted an inexpensive hotel downtown that was close to Pike Market, restaurants and other attractions and this fit the bill. The front desk staff was very very friendly helping us find restaurants and directions back to the airport. If you just want a place to sleep (because you'll mostly be out touristing, if you aren't looking for luxury, don't care about matching furniture, or city noises, this hotel is perfect. The beds were clean and comfy and I really liked the pillows. The room was cleaned both days and fresh towels delivered. I read all the previous reviews and was concerned but decided it would be an adventure and if nothing else we would have a good story. But after staying there I realized that expectations really vary amongst guests. We felt safe, slept well, had nice staff encounters. If you want luxury, and newer accommodations, then by all means stay at the mocking W hotel. But if you were reamed liked we were on the airfare and don't have the money, stay here. Its funky, old, centrally located and has a nice staff.ps. The photographer who shot the lovely photo of the room did and amazing job, and possibly knows a lot about photoshop. Our room paled by comparison. But that's OK

<Content>Beware My family and I were traveling to Seattle for the graduation of our niece. This was a special time for us. A member of the family looked on the web for a hotel close to the graduation facility. All looked well on the internet for moderate priced accomodations for three nights. We called them directly and booked the stay. The staff was very nice and none of this review is meant to reflect on the them in any way. We understood that this was a moderate priced placed to stay but did not expect the what we found.The rooms are dark and dank and look like something that comes out of film noir. The bathroom had paper rolling off of the walls; it took two to three flushes for the toilet to flush. it was the most depressing place I have ever stayed in. We knew immediately upon arrival in the room that we could not stay there for 3 nights, so we took steps to find other acommodations and were fortunate to find them. We had to stay one night and I spent that entire time awake. We were at the nearest coffee shop at 5:30 a.m. and left in a taxi by 8:30 a.m.I write this review out of concern for others who plan to stay there. It was not a pleasant experience. Beware.

<Content>Last Resort Faced with a completely sold out Seattle on a recent trip, I booked one night at The Hotel Seattle as a last resort. You should do the same, though you may first want to consider the more pleasant surroundings of a bus station. This is a truly awful, depressing hotel. I imagine most of the stains in the 30-year old carpet are the remnants of past guests who, when faced with the prospect of spending a night in this hotel, took their own lives. I myself managed to survive, wisely spending very little time in my room, which was on a high floor, overlooking a proud, mocking W Hotel. I stayed out as late as possible and checked out by 5:00 am, my escape somewhat delayed by a desk clerk who was having trouble lining up the little holes in the paper of a relic of a dot matrix printer.

<Content>Reccommended - Great location and price! After struggling to find a hotel with rooms free at a very busy time of year we eventually found the Hotel Seattle. It is in a great location and half the price of most other hotels in the area. The room was clean although the decor was slightly old-fashioned. Staff were friendly and helpful trying to help out with information about the local area at various times of the day and night. If you just want somewhere to sleep and as a base to explore Seattle this hotel is perfect. If you want somehwere a bit more stylish that will charge you at least twice the price then Seattle has plenty of choice!!!

<Content>No customer service the only good thing was location. the staff was rude, unhelpful, and didn't have knowledge of the area. the tub had black foot prints upon arrival, the towels were old and ratty with holes in them, and the room had a musty smell. the TV only got a clear picture half the time on one channel. the bathroom sink was movable and the toilet was very small, had exposed pipes. no AC so had to sleep with the windows open and downtown Seattle is extremely noisy at night. only one attendant in the entire hotel at night. would not stay here again!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Only good thing was location... The only decent thing about this hotel is the location, which is excellent, I've stayed in better value hostels.The room was dirty, the ceiling plaster had a great chunk missing over the bed and the shower backing was falling off the wall The staff were just not interested. The decor dated from the 1970's and was all various shades of brown, grim and depressing Only stayed one night , then found somewhere else.

<Content>UHHHH place to stay This was a great place for a very low key weekend getaway in a great location. The room was a little dirty and they forgot to change our linens one day but it was in the perfect location and right across the street from the fairmont without the expense. I do not know if we will stay there again but it was ideal on a tight budget.

<Content>Stay in a hostel You will have better accommodations. With a name like Hotel Seattle I expected that they would take more pride in their establishment. My room was falling apart. From the baseboard coming off, to the unfinished shower, and not to mention, the unfinished pipes leading into a cut out hole in the floor. In the height of summer there was no A.C. and the only way to get some cool air was to open the window onto the busy street. I will never recommend Hotel Seattle and made sure none of the guest at the wedding I attended will go there either.

<Content>Dirty and run down Thankfully we only stayed one night at the Hotel Seattle. Our room was an absolute disgrace.....very tatty witha layer of dust on most furniture. The bathroom had to be seen to be believed. The bath was old with ingrained dirt, the sink wobbled and leaked at the base. The floor tiles had a few decades ago seen better days. The shower head was loose.............the list is endless. We payed$96 plus tax. For that amount I expected a basic clean room. I have stayed in many hotels over the years and I can truly say that this hotel ranks as the worst I have ever stayed in. Whilst the location is handy for many of the tourist sights, it is not the best area to wander around at night and we felt quite uneasy doing so.I wish I had consulted Trip Advisor before staying there. Stay away!

<Content>Scary experience all around The staff was nice. That's about the only nice thing I can say about this place. The photos of the hotel are very misleading. Standing outside looking at the hotel, you have to wonder if the photo on their website has been doctored at all. The photos of the rooms were obviously taken at a different hotel because the room I was put in, and then moved to another looked NOTHING like the room photos on their website. As someone else said in a previous review about this hotel, don't walk around the room without your shoes and socks on. Definitely not a romantic getaway (unless you're trying to break up with someone.) The sheets had hair on them. I requested a non-smoking room, but you could tell that someone had smoked in it previously. There was no air condtioning or a fan. Big deal, it's Seattle, right? Wrong. It was 90 plus degrees during my stay. The windows do open though, providing little relief. Cable television? Non-existant. I was told that sometimes it comes in, and sometimes it doesn't. What does that mean, really? It's sad when you pay $96 a night and can't even get the local channels (NBC, ABC, CBS.) Go on the internet for your news? There is no internet, unless you want to setup your laptop for dialup. The restaurant downstairs was a dive. Again, the service was great, but as with the rooms, you could tell that management didn't quite care about upgrading anything. Several times during my meal, I could have swore I saw something scurrying across the floor. The waitress seemed embarrassed while attempting to relieve me of my worries. I forgot to mention the lobby. The sofa was very comfortable. In fact, it may have been the nicest thing in the entire hotel. However, don't lean your head back while on the sofa or you'll notice that there is paint peeling off the ceiling in large chunks held together by duct tape in places. Speaking of duct tape, there was actually duct tape holding the carpet together in several places. The room I stayed in had scotch tape holding the wallpaper over this gaping hole. Security risk? Room keys have the room number and hotel name on the key ring. So, don't bring anything valuable, because who knows how often the locks are changed and if previous customers have lost their keys on drinking binges in Pioneer Square. There is no room service. It looked like there was only one person there at all times. If you're hungry, don't eat the food in the vending machine. Both the pretzels and Twix candybar were past their expiration date. At check out, staff was apologetic for the things I told them, but obviously not at fault. While you could sense their understandable frustration through their body language (not quite making eye contact, embarrased look on their face), you got the feeling that they hear about similar guest experiences on a regular basis. It's a shame because it's in a great location. You almost wonder if management is even in it to make money. I never did hear back from them after I sent a letter detailing my disappointments. I highly recommend not staying here. Avoid at all costs.

<Content>Great value and comfortable! What a relief! I blindly booked this by calling the hotel - they only had a suite - and got a great rate. Our room was clean (a few carpet stains in corners, no big deal), huge, smoke-free, had a kitchenette (microwave) and was in the middle of downtown.The staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurant attached was excellent for breakfast, comfortable enough beds, and the location was quiet at night. Our room was right next to the elevator, and even that was inaudible!Cons - parking can be a nightmare - its street or city parking garage only, which can be costly ($20/day); not much of a view; some of the floors look like they might not have been updated - ask for one that has (and a suite!); only one elevator for about 11 floors); not too generous on the extra amenities (towels, shampoo, pillows) - if you ask, you get what you need though.

<Content>Budget traveler's delight Seattle Hotel is all about location. It is in a good area within a block of the Fairmont and Monte Carlo on Seneca Street. It is right beside a starbucks. The hotel is a 1930's hotel, which today makes it very run down and basic. The lobby is simple yet attractive. Check in service was quick and basic. The rooms had furniture that was chipping its finishing. TV was basic 6 channels and not all coming in clear. There was no radio.The beds were comfortable. The pillows were a bit clumpy.The bathroom tub was aged and had markings on it from its life use. The toilet was like one from a ferry with a push handle. The bathroom was small and basic. Although run down, it did not concern me. Shag carpet and wall paper dated from the 1930's.I had a comfortable sleep and was happy to be paying a budget price for a quick overnight stay.Its the perfect stop for a budget traveler and someone not expecting more from the decor.

<Content>Ok if you just need a place to sleep First off, I will say that this hotel is in a great location, 3 blocks to the pike place market, shopping etc. Second, of course this hotel is located on a hill...all of downtown seattle toward the water is. If you are elderly, you may have issues with this but for most people it will not be an issue. This hotel pretty much only has its location going for it. It is an old hotel, which is pretty rundown. It did have clean sheets, which is basically what we were looking for. Did I walk around barefoot on the carpet or bathroom floor, the answer is no. A little dirty/dingy but ok for a place to sleep. For the price in downtown, its hard to beat. Also, be advised they have no parking (typical for seattle), there are 2 huge parking garages though within a block or two of the hotel so you shouldn't have issues with that.

<Content>Not bad at all The location is unmatchable in this price range. A simple sleeping room is $80 but expect to pay 2x's that anywhere else. It was surprisingly cleaner than most hotels I've seen in the past week but I've been driving up from LA and staying at Travelodge and Days Inn and Motel 6. The quality of the furnishings was high. Sure, it's a little run down in spots but it's just an old building with some of the usual character flaws but none affected the comfort. We were lucky enough also to get a corner room so that made it especially nice to look over at the W and know they are paying $250+/night. It had a full bath, everything worked -- we don't care to watch tv anyway on vacation so have no idea how that worked but if you want to believe all the other comments, feel free. It will mean more room for us when we come back.

<Content>Dreadful Avoid this hotel at all costs. Even at half the price, it would still be throwing money away. While the location is very desirable, it is in disrepair, ugly, unclean, and generally unpleasant. The toilet in my room malfunctioned daily. The television would only pick up two stations. Although I had a great time with a friend in Seattle, I was happy to leave this hotel. It should not have a star rating at all.

<Content>Old and Rundown The location was pretty nice, although it was on a steep hill. The TV was very old. We had problems with the heater in our room and had to bang on it a lot. We stayed here for a night and then moved to the Comfort Inn by the airport. It was too expensive to stay here for the value of the hotel.

<Content>Compares to a motel I don't know how this hotel can get away with a description like: All of the guest rooms have been remodeled in a relaxing decor (from expedia), when the only thing that seemed to have been updated since the 1970s is the television. There is no room for toiletries in the bathroom, and the tiny pillows were very lumpy. If you don't mind staying at a Super 8 or Motel 6, you should stay here. Otherwise, I suggest you spend a few more bucks and stay elsewhere.

<Content>Not a 2 Star Hotel Pros: Good safe downtown location. Walking distance to market, downtown stores, etc. Room and bathroom were clean. Request the non-smoking floor. Pleasant desk staff. Two coffee places around the corner. Cons: Looks like it hasn't been redecorated since the 1950's. An OK place if you want a simple place to sleep and shower. For the same room rate, the Executive Pacific Plaza (about 1/2 block away) is much nicer.

<Content>Terrible! I've never had a worse experience at a hotel, and I travel a lot for business. The place is a dive...old, dirty and grungy. Not to mention, they charge for services not rendered, and refuse to issue a credit, even in the case of an innocent mistake. Don't waste your time here, not even for their cheap rate!

<Content>ramshackle place Stayed in Hotel Seattle due to last minute trip to Seattle and could only find vacancies at this hotel. Room wouldn't lock easily, bathroom was dirty; no place for toiletries; no cable and poor reception on the few channels you get. Will never stay there again.
